  & MS Office) come with a variety of serif fonts. If you were limited to use Microsoft
  serif fonts only (for printed text), which would be your favourites to use?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MS
  serif fonts_4575.PNG]\r\n\r\nI like Century Schoolbook, Goudy Old Style and Book
  Antiqua (Palatino Linotype has a wider line spacing by default).\r\n\r\nThank you."

      Fonts supplied with MS Windows and MS Office are the most common MS system fonts
      people use, I assume\u2026"

  body: Like Hrant, I choose Georgia. Matthew Carter has a remarkable ability to apply
    the master craftsman's touch to mass-produced workhorse typefaces. When I'm writing
    letters or reports that only have to look professional, not capital-D Designed,
    I always use Georgia. And when it's necessary for business reasons to work in
    PowerPoint, I prefer to use Georgia, because it'll look like a grownup did it,
    but it won't default to Courier on my client's screen.

    body: "Georgia looks good. But don't you think Georgia is a bit too bold for print?
      It's an often heard criticism... Which line spacing do you use when using Georgia?\r\n"

  body: "I prefer somewhat dark text fonts (both aesthetically and functionally) so
    to me that's a plus. :-)  The linespacing of course depends on the line length;
    that said, due to its larger-than-average x-height, use a greater-than-usual linespacing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>too bold for print</em>\r\nIf I'm going to print something, I don't need
    to concern myself with whether my reader has the same fonts installed on the device
    they're reading on. Therefore, I don't need to limit myself to MS system fonts.\r\nWhen
    I do use Georgia, I use leading about 1/4 of the point size (12/15, 24/30, etc
    ), if space permits."
