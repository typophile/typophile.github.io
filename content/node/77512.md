  really, ...is the canvas / paper's edge a finality to a letter shape - a word -
  or even a phrase? I don't think so!! I think acknowledging and defeating a barrier
  can strengthen the message's intent. \r\n\r\nMy fresh new method of chopping a letter
  shape and then continuing with the chopped off letter's shape below on a perceived
  following line has a undefeated quality.\r\n\r\nChallenge the limit!\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nI
  really want to get this up on a canvas asap, and then onto posters :)\r\n\r\nMerry
  Christmas!!!\r\n\r\n"
