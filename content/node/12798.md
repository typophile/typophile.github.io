  body: "What is the source of this image? How large is the original? Is it a tattoo?\r\n\r\nThe
    accented E has a different shape than the un-accented one, but other repeated
    letters do look identical. That doesn't rule out the possibility of a font, but
    I wonder if this was made with metal or wood type, or even rubber stamps, and
    not done by a computer.\r\n\r\nI don't recall ever seeing a font like this. It
    seems like something I would remember, but I can't say I've seen every font :)\r\n\r\n-
