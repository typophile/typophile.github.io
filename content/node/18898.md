  body: "I'd guess that this was done by hand. It looks a lot like the lettering style
    you see in some graffiti.\r\n"

  body: It isn't a logo per se. This only appeared on one cd cover. My first guess
    was that it's hand drawn, but I thought I'd take a shot anyway.

  body: There are enough differences between the two 'E's that drawn would be my guess.
