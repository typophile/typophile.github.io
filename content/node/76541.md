  to figure out what the original font (that this font was based on) is. \r\n\r\nIt
  is similar to ITC Century Schoolbook, but has elements of San Serif in it too, as
  seen in the lowercase i\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help that would be great!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance : )\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Dingbats/11940/FifthCopySSK.aspx"
