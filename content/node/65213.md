body: "Hi. I have a problem. I had a great plan to use Fedra sans and Fedra serif
  (www.typotheque.com/fonts) for big, industrial corporations personnel magazines
  family. Unfortunately Fedra was out of the game since the brand manager didn't want
  to see font that's she's seen before in one of their publications. (come on, redesigning
  doesn't mean that you really have to get rid of everything good as well!)\r\n\r\nFedra
  was so perfect: \r\n-it had some playfulness and softness, big variety of weights,
  it suports all needed languages (Russia, slavic languages etc). I really need to
  get out of being upset with my great idea using Fedra crashed, and find something
  totally new: something that is not too serious, but is clear and fresh and speaks
  to people working in the factories and does it in all those different languages.
  \r\n\r\nplease, cheer me up! Thanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for suggestions! I would seriously consider them, just that they are
    lacking Cyrillics.\r\n\r\nOh, boy, I could make a book about \"yes it's cool,
    but it doesn't support scandinavian, cyrillic and East Europian glyphs\" That's
    what you have to deal in Finland all the time with!\r\n\r\nAnyways. What do you
    think about Leksa? I have my doupts that it might be too oldish and stylish for
    my purpose? But I love it!\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Alexandra_Korolkova/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    maybe take a look at [[http://www.parachute.gr/fonts.aspx|Parachute]]'s fonts,
    f.e. Centro Sans + Serif."
