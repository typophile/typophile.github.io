  body: "Very pretty, poorly spaced. I've [in]famously equated it to a beautiful woman
    with a terrible speech impediment. Great to take to a party, just don't let her
    talk. Robin Kinross has equated it to a loose bicycle. Either way, a tricky ride.\r\n\r\nSo
    don't use it for text. Use it large for a\r\ncouple of lines, and space it all
    by hand.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    So true!\r\nShe <em>was</em> named after <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001691.html\">\"Baskerville's
    love-muffin\"</a>\u2026 And I've never heard a muffin speak."

    an act of feminism, not a slight on the proletariat marrying above their station.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Um, of course. No offense to Mrs Eaves (the font, or the person*); I was just
    cracking up here from that mental image.

  body: "The popular success of Mrs Eaves the font however is very much an offense
    to the meticulous craft of text face design. It's like people don't care what
    a woman says as long as she's hot.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
