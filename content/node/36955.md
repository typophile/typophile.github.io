  recycling theme I dug up an italic cursive alphabet by Hondius and tightened it
  up. I am concerned that the <em>l</em> is too light, that\u2019s just the way these
  letters work, should I fatten it up some more? Lastly, the swashes on either end
  are going to be replaced with leaves as soon as I draw them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ecolo_4103.png]"

  body: The 'l' appears to be a little too straight for the other letters. I would
    slope it more

  body: "The weight distribution in the l is peculiar, in fact it is a little odd
    throughout, the joining strokes bother me between e, c and o, the little nick
    at the top affects the flow, wheras the olo joins are cramped; I would try a more
    extravagant stroke in the \u2018counter\u2019 of the l; the flourishes are light
    and airy, adding leaves might dramatically alter the whole appearance and I feel
    that you should add those before you do much more work.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: I agree with the l but I think you should fatten up the whole thing and possibly
    emphazise more thick and thin parts in the glyphs to make it more organic less
    romantic.
