  demand (over 1300 reads/visitors for\r\npart 1) here's a second (or third if you
  count the Perpetua\r\none embedded in the Matrix thread) challenge:\r\n\r\nSome
  people don't mind, some people* might actually like it,\r\nbut over the years I've
  heard complaints about the terminal\r\nof the \"r\" in Stone Serif, in an otherwise
  commendable design.\r\nI highly doubt it might cause reading stutters like the \"g\"\r\nin
  Matrix, but calling that terminal shape \"sickly, cloying\"\r\n(as I've done previously)
  is just brutal honesty in my book.\r\nIt's so ridiculous that even in their own
  \"On Stone\" specimen\r\nbook they make fun of it - from page 46:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/other/Stone-r.gif
  _\r\nAnd you thought I was just being mean...\r\n\r\n* Souvenir/phototype/TNT/mushy/70s
  types?\r\n\r\nOther glyphs (\"a\", \"c\", \"f\", \"y\") have that basic terminal\r\nshape
  too, but it is in the \"r\" that it rears its annoying\r\nlittle head (quite literally
  it seems) most prominently.\r\nErgo: if you can fix that, the others are easy.\r\n\r\nAnd
  while you're at it, and especially if you go ahead and\r\nmod the other four glyphs
  with that most affronting appendage,\r\nI might suggest you try to fix the bowl
  of the \"a\" too. Please.\r\n\r\nTwo final things:\r\n- Since this is more of a
  finish thing and not a\r\n  structure thing like Matrix was, we'll need to\r\n  see
  polished forms, large.\r\n- The ethical caveats from before still stand of\r\n  course:
  don't use a swiped font - work from a\r\n  rendering/scan if you have to; and certainly\r\n
  \ don't redistribute any cannibalized outlines.\r\n\r\nMay the flogging stick be
  with you.\u2122\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nLater on in this thread I think we might\r\ntry
  a Stone Informal challenge as well.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    for the \"a\", you could do either - although for Informal I might also suggest
    doing the \"g\". (Man, that letter is at <cite>every</cite> party.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
