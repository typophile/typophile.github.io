    with Bai on some typefaces we will be releasing at Font Bros and Veer in the coming
    weeks and she's done some outstanding work. . .\r\n\r\nBeing that there is a steep
    learning curve to making typefaces, her talents in Illustrator have done well
    to bring a good majority of the drawing effort forward while I can focus on the
    production side and it has worked out well . . .\r\n\r\nShe continues to work
    on projects with me but has more time available than as many projects as I can
    have her work on so take advantage of her talents if you have a pile of drawings
    you've been 'waiting to get to one of these days'\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart :D"

  body: "Actually, Now that I think about it I have some questions.\r\n\r\nIt seems
    like there would be some downsides to not doing your vectorization in Fontlab.
    But the ones I can think of off the top of my head can be defeated - consistent
    relative size for instance.\r\n\r\nWhat do you see as the pros & cons of the model
    you have?\r\n\r\nWould you given your druthers, have choosen to have Bai work
    in Fontlab directly?\r\n\r\nAlso, Bai, I suggest that you alter your registration
    to include your full name. It looks more serious trust worthy etc."

  body: "I was going to respond last evening but my eyes were too tired . . .\r\n\r\nSo
    with a mostly fresh brain on your questions Eben, I think I need to quality the
    type of type I'm developing with Bai which is strictly display work. It's not
    as dogmatic and exacting as what is required for text work but still requires
    a good deal of attention to create nice letter combinations that feel correct
    and are visually balanced throughout.\r\n\r\nNow as to the Illustrator vs. Fontlab
    matter, I definitely prefer that Bai works in Illustrator because it's still generally
    a more comfortable environment for me to draw my own glyphs in and even if nodes
    have to snap to a 1000em grid, who's to say what 'correct' is if the integrity
    of the form is still well intact . . .\r\n\r\nI have drawn faces in Fontlab and
    still find it cumbersome and slow but I suspect practice will improve both of
    those things . . .\r\n\r\nTo your question about the pros and cons of the model
    Bai and I are working within, I'd say there are far more pros than cons.\r\n\r\nFor
    starters, I'm betting like every font designer on this board, we have more type
    specimen references and sketches than we may ever turn into typeface in our natural
    lifetimes and while I may 'cherrypick' my favorites to take from top to tail,
    there are still some really nice specimens that will otherwise never have a life
    digitally without enlisting the efforts of a competent vector tracing artist.\r\n\r\nAnd
    at worst, I can critique the work Bai provides me and in turn educate her to become
    a better lettering artist and typeface designer in her own right so I think it's
    a win-win situation all around . . .\r\n\r\nI think I am a rare breed in the font
    world in that I have always embraced collaboration rather than tried to hold all
    my cards so close to the vest and try to maintain a solo effort. There are so
    many talented lettering artists, type technologists, software maketers, and licensing
    attorneys (OK one that I know :D) alike that working in a bubble can stunt professional
    growth and limit how far one can go in this field.\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

  body: "Thanks Stuart! Because I have become accustomed to fontlab at this point
    the approach was not intuitive to me. But I do understand how you would stick
    to the tool that feels most right to you. I occasionally wish I had some of the
    AI tools in Fontlab & vice versa. But this makes sense to me now. And your final
    point is certainly an excellent one. Hopefully your \"type\" is becoming less
    rare.\r\n\r\n"
