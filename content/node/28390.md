    body: No, it's not Georgia.  But Georgia's close.  Look at the "k" in "book" in
      the photo.  The ital version of Georgia doesn't have the same flourish to it.

    body: The link you sent for Ruse doesn't seem to direct me to a Bold or Black
      as demonstrated in the example I uploaded.  Ruse is a beautiful font though!

  body: Sorry.  Found out the link you sent does have various weights based on the
    matrix clickable at the bottom.  Thanks.  Beautiful (and pricey) font.

  body: "The TEFF site is not the easiest one to navigate. :) There's also so much
    different weights I can't seem to figure out which one is the correct... try this:
    http://www.teff.nl/fonts/ruse/ruse100_lntx_italic.html\r\n\r\nRuse is very expensive,
    but I think it's worth it. I've seen books using that typeface and they are gorgeous..\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Just like you said.. ;)"

    body: Thanks Tomii.  I found a close second to be Bodoni Classic Ad Ital.  That
      one, I have!
