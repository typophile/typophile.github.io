body: "An Indesign file I've been working on has suddenly decided not to open (Error
  code 4) and I'm wondering what the problem might be.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it's to
  do with the fonts in the doc. I'm using Gill Sans MT Light for the body text but
  there are frequent 'bolds' in Gill Sans MT [ie. the medium weight]. They are not
  style linked, so that's rather a lot of font switching in the document.\r\n\r\nMight
  this sort of thing create an unstable document?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance,\r\n\r\nGeraint\r\n\r\n"

  body: Switching fonts instead of style-linking should not corrupt a document. Many
    publication designers do not use style-linking at all; they create styles for
    all instances of bolds and italics to avoid any linking or naming problems across
    different typefaces.

  body: "There's no such thing as style-linking of fonts in an InDesign *file* anyway;
    InDesign only uses the style links as part of a shortcut way of switching fonts,
    but the net effect in terms of what is stored in the document file is no different
    than picking the other style off the menu.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
