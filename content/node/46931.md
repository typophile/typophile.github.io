  that came out on top for the client -- almost unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe client is
  a high end caterer that mostly caters high-end weddings held in private and public
  mansions. They wanted to upgrade their identity to reflect the perfect, polished,
  and remarkable events they cater. They have a lot of name recognition in their geographic
  area and are also very proud of the personal attention that each event gets from
  their staff.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the main \"Russell Morin\" type -- I slightly
  modified a very beautiful typeface and added some elements of the owners signature
  into it. Though, if you have comments on that, I'd love to hear them (I'm certainly
  not a type expert). I'm having the most trouble with the treatment/typeface/size
  of the \"fine catering\" tagline. I just can't get it to seem to work in a sophisticated
  enough fashion. Please help me out!\r\n\r\nThanks a million!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RM_logo_6140.jpg]"

  body: "The signature script is nice. However, the R seems a little out of place.
    Alone, the R doesn't resemble an R, you might want to play with the curve from
    the top of the R to the bottom of the leg as it extends under the u. \r\n\r\nFor
    the tag... I'm assuming you're using Copperplate Gothic, which is a nice choice.
    I'd move the tag below the signature, centered and shrink the size to almost half
    the width of the signature. The space between the signature and the tag should
    be equal to about 1.5 the tag's size. (So, if the tag was 12 points, the space
    between the tag and the signature would be 18 points.) Centering it, will also
    give the signature a nice balancing point. \r\n\r\nThe color seems very light.
    If you were to convert that to grey scale, it would probably be equal to 10-15%
    black, that's too light. Consider bumping up the saturation.\r\n\r\nIt has a nice
    look to it, it's really at the tweak stage. I'd be interested to see your other
    iterations before they picked this one.\r\n"

    darker, but I actually like it aligned right. It balances the curve of the script
    lettering, and if it's centered, the script may look lopsided. \r\n\r\nOverall,
    it's very nice work. I worked many years in five diamond catering, and it's refreshing
    to see a brand without an ornate crest or bow tie. I think the extra touch of
    sophistication you're looking for may be found in the media - 100% cotton paper
    and embossed letterpress printing.\r\n\r\nEileen"

    from Russell's (the owner) signature. After reading your comments I want to be
    sure that it (1) reads as an \"R\" and (2) doesn't seem too awkward with the rest
    of the type treatment.\r\n\r\nI agree, aluminum, if you have to say that you are
    \"cool\" then you just aren't. We went through a name change with them and they
    just couldn't lose the Fine Catering.\r\n\r\nI'd love some typeface suggestions
    for the \"fine catering\" tagline -- I'm okay with the Copperplate but I don't
    love it and feel like there could be something nicer out there that I'm totally
    overlooking.\r\n\r\nHow could I have not even considered letterpress for this
    logo? It was totally off of my radar. Thanks for the suggestion it is really meant
    for it. I do agree, though -- the strength in the logo is closely tied to how
    it is held up by the medium's it is printed on and the other surrounding design
    elements."

  body: The more I look at it, the R is starting to grow on me. It's the simple fact
    that the stroke is consistent. It doesn't vary in weight (thick to thin) as many
    of the other characters do. Perhaps adding a little stroke weight variation would
    be enough to make it blend better with the rest of the signature script.

    it a bit more.\r\n\r\nCan you compare two tagline treatments for me? I'm really
    just splitting hairs, I think. I can't decide: (Copperplate on top Topaz on bottom)\r\n\r\nI
    love the Topaz face -- I was concerned that the shaded font wouldn't read well
    when the logo was scaled down so I used the background version instead. I think
    the height of the font will help readability when scaled and if it is scaled really
    small I'll lose the \"fine catering\" tagline. Similarly, though, I am worried
    that the serif's of Copperplate won't read well when scaled down. Perhaps that
    was my initial hesitation with Copperplate. Does anyone have a preference?\r\n\r\nThe

    a new signature, using a really big Sharpie? One with a chisel tip, perhaps. Then
    run it through the photocopier a few times to give it some wear and tear before
    adding it to the script.  Cezanne has a lot of character and additional R is just
    flat next to it. "

    I walked acorss the room at looked at my screen. Topaz was stronger.\r\n\r\nI

    repeated anything.\r\n\r\nThe 'R' and the 'M' look like they come from different
    'hands'. The dot on the 'i' is too long for my liking \u2013\_looks messy. The
    join between the second 's' and the 'e' needs to be smoothened out (feels mechanical).
    Russell and Morin seem to have a different rhythm going on (the Russell seems
    less consistent, the Morin has a steady rythem). I know this is a hybrid between
    Cezanne and a real signature, but it needs a little more refinement to feel like
    it came from 'one' hand. On the other hand, I liked the first design and its colours.
    The rectangle to me says 'table' or 'fine linen'. And, though I like Topaz, in
    this case I prefer the Copperplate \u2013\_has a little more character and because
    it is a wide font, acts as a nice support/line (so no line). But, I'd modify the
