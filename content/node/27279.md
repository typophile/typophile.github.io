  of a range of characters in FLS5? Say I wanted to add 10 units to either side of
  the capital letters. Is there a (semi)automatic way to do this within FLS5?"

  body: "Also, in action set you can make a set of actions for sidebearings and save
    it so you can change the numbers if needed.  For example: select round letters
    and add 10 to sidebearings on both sides; select straight glyphs and add 20 to
    both sides; select round right straight left glyphs (p, b, etc) and add 20 to
    left and 10 to right side bearings.\r\n\r\nIf you have made metrics classes, you
    can make selections from those. You can also fix one glph of a given type, copy
    it from the full font screen, then \"paste special\" to a larger number of glyphs
    and choose paste sidebearings and or kerning.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
