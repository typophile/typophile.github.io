  as the primary typeface. I am looking for a versatile, serif as a complimentary
  typeface, and for large blocks of text. Not much of a brief on this one, but needs
  to feel modern, serious, legible, and suggest longevity, history \u2013 a bit of
  a confusing brief you will agree!\r\n\r\nFreight (and Freight Micro) are currently
  leading the way, hoping for some more suggestions though!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve"
