body: "So, I caught a friend of mine sifting around DA Fonts looking for a typeface
  for a design that involves binary code...namely, a bunch of ones and zeros. The
  string of code looks like this:\r\n\r\n01100101 01110110 01101111 01101100 01110110
  01100101\r\n\r\nExciting, right? I was thinking something with a little more decoration
  to the 0's (dots, dashes), with blocky forms that aren't too heavy, along with serifs
  on the 1. So while I sift through my own collection of typefaces, I decided to propose
  a few questions to all of you seasoned typophiles...\r\n\r\nWhat is your favorite
  system/small/8bit/computer font?\r\nWhy?\r\nDo the 1's and 0's in the typeface invoke
  the feeling of retro computer technology effectively, while remaining clean and
  legible from a distance?"

    beyng confused with any other glyph, a slashed zero is the best option. An \"empty\"
    one would be more distinct from 1s.\r\nMonospaced, definitely.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/search/google/monospaced\r\n"
