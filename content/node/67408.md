  is by now much better software?\r\n\r\nTips anyone?"

    too (specially if you used to work with the old Fontographer). There\u2019s a
    version of Fontographer (4.7) who runs in Mac OS X and the developers presented
    at Atypi the soon to be realized Fontographer 5.\r\n\r\nThat said, the way to
    go now is Fontlab: it enables a lot of good stuff but, as I said, it\u2019s a
    tool that requires a lot of patience, training, watching forums like this\u2026\r\n\r\nMore

    you may see, both softwares are from the same company now.)"

    to the tools in FontLab. Of course, I am quite cozy with other programs like FontForge,
    which omashuisje is probably not.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a font with Illustator
    as your drawing tool, then that's perfectly fine. FontLab has an option to import
    both Illustrator and Encapsulated Postscript files. Although, you will have to
    export each glyph individually (there might be scripts to do this, although I'm
    not exactly sure, as Illustrator isn't my tool of choice for drawing glyphs).\r\n\r\nIt
    takes a bit of practice, but it shouldn't be a total pain. I wish luck! :)"

    (a PDF available for free in FontLab site). Don't be intimidated by the large
    number of pages. Parts of the manual are repeated to let user find proper info
    in an easier way. And, as you already designed your font, you can even ignore
    some chapters about specific design tools.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a typeface in that
    way: design the glyphs in Illustrator, copy and paste them in FontLab. Instructions
    about how to bring the vectors from IL to FL are in page 520. You don't have to
    export each glyph as an EPS.\r\n\r\nYou may get the impression the program is
    somewhat complex, but this is not really true (in my opinion). There are some
    aspects of type design which are complex <em>per si</em>, as hinting and kerning.\r\n\r\nI
    did not used FontForge, so cannot talk about it.\r\n"

    If you want a state-of-the-art typeface, Fontlab is your best option. I am just
    saying that in the good old days Fontographer was great (\u201Cquite pleasing\u201D,
    as omashuisje said). But certainly they were simpler times: only 256 characters
    per font, not so many options in the font info, no OT features to worry about\u2026
    Really easy to get a font working in your system. That takes more effort today.
    I haven\u2019t used it in years, but I remember that it was a lovely tool. omashuisje\u2019s
    wish about a software \u201Csimple yet effective\u201D sounds more like Fontographer
    to me, specially if he worked with that software in the past. But yeah, he can
    download the Fontlab demo, read the manual, and decide for himself.\r\n\r\n[BTW,
    this nostalgic feeling about Fontographer is shared by many people: otherwise
    Fontlab\u2019s people wouldn\u2019t resurrect it.]"

    is preparing a new version of Fontographer. Their approach is to make it easier
    than FontLab. Anyway, there is no release date planned by now.\r\n\r\nCristobal
    made an opportune observation. These days, it seems font design became more and
    more complex. So, even with an 'easy' program, to build a font is a difficult
    task."

  body: I'll second James' recommendation for ScanFont. It doesn't do much, but what
    it does do can save a huge amount of time and tedious effort. Sure, it costs a
    hundred bucks, but how much is your time worth to you? Unless maybe you're doing
    it totally as a hobby kind of thing...

    You will need another tool to generate the .otf files.

  body: Well, yes, it's meant to work with either FontLab or TypeTool. It produces
    .vfb files, or moves outlines directly to one of those two apps. If you're not
    using either of those programs, then it's kind of useless. But, if you are, it
    makes a lot of sense to have it around.

    it has all the technical specs pretty much right. \r\n\r\nBut on the other hand,
    your basic design has some very basic flaws: your 'S' and 's' are just too wide,
    and also your 'm'is too wide, as well as your 'x'. In a sense your 'a' works,
    but I would narrow it some 10 to 20 percent.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that you have
    taken a well used font, figured out the scale and proportions, and used those
    for your design. \r\n\r\nWell done."

    not sure whether you're being sarcastic or just positive... I guess it depends

    Gerard Unger's Big Vesta. I know it looks a lot like it, but hey, I just like
    to draw fonts as a hobby. Imitation is the highest form of flattery. \r\n\r\nThanks
