  no kerning info. If I use the same font in CorelDraw, my letters get kerned the
  way that kerning was defined.\r\n\r\nI've read somewhere that Adobe programs ignore
  kerning if there is only one (in this case kern) feature.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do
  and how should I do it?"

    did I do?\r\n\r\n1. created a \"fl\" ligature\r\n2. created new OT feature \"liga\"\r\n3.
    recompiled features\r\n4. created my OpenType PS font\r\n\r\nVOILA. Two features
    and Adobe InDesign does kerning correctly."

  body: "Yes, it is a known bug in InDesign CS2 (you forgot to mention the most important
    \"fact\", i.e. which InDesign you're using). The number of features in the font
    is not important but the OpenType fonts must have at least one feature that does
    glyph substitution (so a GSUB table is present in the font). If only positioning
    is used in the font (e.g. in kern or cpsp features), the features will not work
    at all. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Yes it was InDesign CS2. :)\r\n\r\nAs I've read (don't know exactly where)
    the same bug is present in all Adobe programs. Don't know if it's the CS2 version
    of them, but it's there..."
