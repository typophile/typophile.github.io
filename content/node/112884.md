  body: "The only \"mainstream\" use of Ritalic (I didn't just make up that term :-)
    I've heard of is for denoting rivers on maps. Related to that, I think lettering
    on boats, planes, etc. can benefit from it.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do feel there's
    more unexplored potential for Ritalic, especially concerning mixing with Semitic
    scripts (which go leftward).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm of the opinion that for Hebrew, at least, italics should indeed slope
    in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of the use of reversed italics
    to indicate rivers. Using them to indicate sarcasm is an interesting idea, but
    it's just useful to have another way to indicate emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe thought
    has struck me that it might be a good thing if reversed italics for the Roman
    alphabet were sloped by a significantly smaller angle (say by 15 degrees or so)
    than normal italics. That would avoid them being mistaken for normal italics at
    a quick glance. Also, that would be useful to avoid clashing with how the letters
    are structured, and to allow them to be a slanted roman instead of a semi-script-like
    new set of characters like true italics. (And having them a slanted roman again
    differentiates them from normal italics in a second way.)"

  body: "Regular left-leaning italics are usually sloped between 10\xB0 and 15\xB0
    (I often see something close to 12\xB0), with some variation among individual
    characters. Ritalics sloped 15\xB0 the other direction would look very laid-back
    indeed. "

  body: My memory was playing tricks on me. I see, now that I checked, that ordinary
    Times 327 was sloped by 16 degrees, and Times 569 was sloped by 12 degrees. So
    I suppose a slope of 8 degrees or less is what I would really like to see for
    Ritalics. Perhaps 5 to 7 degrees.
