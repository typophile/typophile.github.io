body: "I've seen many fonts that use adscript iotas in compound glyphs (Ai, Hi, etc.)
  but there are many others that use it as a subscript, under the main character glyph.
  Wikipedia says that the adscript is preferred for epigraphy, paleography or other
  philological contexts blah blah blah...\r\nI ask to the people that know best the
  language: greek people. Which one is really preferred in Greece? Adscript iotas
  or subscript iotas? I think they both look nice but I'm not greek, just a guy making
  a font.\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "From the Blah-blah-blah...(Wikipedia)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The iota subscript
    is today considered an obligatory feature in the spelling of Ancient Greek, but
    its usage is subject to some variation. In some modern editions of classical texts,
    the historical spelling with a restored full-size adscript \u2329\u03B9\u232A
    is preferred. The same is generally true for works dealing with epigraphy, paleography
    or other philological contexts where adherence to original historical spellings
    is considered important.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nProbably why Adobe includes both
    styles when they include polytonic Greek --Arno, Minion, Garamond Premier, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing I've run into is authors who insist the Greek circumflex be a tilde, others
    who insist on the inverted breve. Fonts have been disqualified from consideration
    because of this.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's probably a matter of how large an audience
    you want to sell to.\r\n\r\nEasiest to just skip the academicians & classical
    Greek. Academicians are notorious for insisting what they want is the only correct,
    proper way... "

    Set. I don\u2019t recall the precedent; I probably followed Adobe\u2019s practice,
    and perhaps discussed this issue at Typophile. That would have been c.2007."

  body: "There are no subscripts in modern Greek, so it only makes sense to include
    them together with polytonic Greek (which is a good idea to include in a typeface
    with Greek if it is intended for books). \r\nIn Classical Greek the default is
    to use the subscript where it should be used (only few cases of \u03B1\u03B9,
    \u03C9\u03B9, etc. require subscript, most don't). Using adscript instead of subscript
    is not correct grammatically, it is a hack to overcome the absence of subscripts
    in a typeface. Conclusion: if you are going to go polytonic include subscript
    together with all other possible combinations of diacritics."
