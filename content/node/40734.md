body: Could anyone please design a font using existing opensource english/european
  font that has wide license and standards (unicode etc) and change two letters to
  another language's alphabet, that can then be used on local machine software applications
  and internet applications?  Please tell me your contact details and costs.

  body: "If that would be hacking to a *glyph variant* that is preferred in the given
    language (to be default), that sounds fine (given that one takes a free font that
    allows changes to it).\r\nHowever I would discourage changing the *character*
    at a given unicode codepoint to a different one. This can be done in practice,
    but it's discouraged. If I was you I'd check whether the two letters you are looking
    for are not encoded already. They might have evaded your attention.\r\n\r\nAlso
    more details would be useful, both on the letters, languages and application.\r\n\r\nAlso
    be aware, that while you can easily use that font on local applications, on web
    apps (assuming you mean RIA) the font has to be downloaded separately and installed
    by the user to be actually showing."

    should buy a type app and make the modifications yourself to save money and be
    able to do it yourself next time. These days, recommending font lab for this is
    the same as telling someone to go to hell, so we don't recommend that any more.
