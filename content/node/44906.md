  client. typography is not my strength, so i am calling on the gods to help me. I've
  currently got helvetica neu 95\r\nwith a -10 kerning, but it needs the eye of a
  master given that this site will be so minimal in its design, its all about the
  font...\r\n\r\nhere is the link,\r\n\r\nhttp://www.studiopyro.net/clients/HSPR/\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\n\r\nJ\r\n\r\n"

    size?

    Neue Helvetica is not a bad choice, but it won\u2019t add any distinctiveness,
    either. Try finding something that pushes the same buttons but can stand out in
    a room full of neo-grotesques, maybe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/garagefonts/freight_sans/\">Freight</a>
    or <a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/neutra2.shtml\">Neutraface No. 2</a>."

  body: Horizontal scrolling, forgive me, is annoying. You have a lot of unused space
    on the top and bottom as well. White space is nice, but unused space, which is
    different, is a waste. Because I have to scroll horizontally it feels like unused
    space as opposed to white space.  I think this is a great direction, but you need
    to be more ruthless in your grid and space usage. Looks like a fun project.

    minimal, and the color palette is even less. Alas, I turn to contrast and vivid
    imagery to help solve our design problems.\r\n\r\nwe're only on day 3 of the design
    so we'll keep plugging away\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nJ"

  body: "Hi Tiffany, i think the horizontal scrolling you are referring to is because
    we have not sized the site yet. the image you see is taken from my 23' monitor
    so its very wide. there will be no horizontal scrolling when its complete :) it
    will fit proportionally on any computer\r\n\r\nJ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Jay\r\n\r\nIf developing web pages is a regular concern of yours, you should
    look into getting a two monitor set up. Then, have the second monitor small sized
    and set with 1024x768 resolution (or even 800x600), so that you can see how things
    look to the 99% of net users who don't have 23 inch monitors. \r\n\r\nAnd when
    you get used to the second monitor, and move all application palettes over to
    it, you will never want to go back to a single monitor."

  body: I don't think you need to downscale to 800 x 600 px anymore. Or at least,
    consider your audience. If it's old grannies using hand-me-down computers from
    their sons-in-law, then perhaps you do, but if your clientele is going to be more
    sophisticated than that you can assume their equipment will be too. Unless of
    course they will be viewing it on their iPhones...

  body: "\"if your clientele is going to be more sophisticated than that you can assume
    their equipment will be too.\"\r\n\r\nThe size of a web page has nothing to do
    with the hardware. It has everything to do with the browser viewport.\r\n\r\nWhat
    size is that? Anything.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that 'sophisticated' users are just
    as likely to be using smaller devices (iPhones, as stated, or sub-compact laptops)
    as much as they may be using huge monitors on their desktop.\r\n\r\nAlso keep
    in mind that the larger one's monitor gets, two different scenarios can result:
    a) they use 1, much larger browser window to look at web pages or b) they use
    many individual, but smaller browser windows to look at web pages (or have many
    other applications open)"

  body: Before anything else, I'm having a hard time with the photo. Its is quite
    a hard contrast with the white and light grey used in the rest of the design.
    Perhaps you could use black or blue text to even it out.
