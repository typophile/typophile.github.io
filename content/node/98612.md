  body: "Are sites designed as a series of boxes in a grid becoming a trendy new thing?
    Possibly inspired by iPhones and their grid of \u201CApp\u201D buttons? I\u2019m
    seeing more and more of them. They are quite useless, as they offer absolutely
    no information as to where you are going to end up, but gawsh they look purdy!
    Look at me! I\u2019m making a grid! I almost read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Systems-Graphic-Systeme-Visuele-Gestaltung/dp/3721201450\">a
    book</a>! And while we\u2019re at it, please, stop it with the tiny, trendy, hard
    to read light grey type already. When the fad fades and you go back to black,
    I\u2019m totally going to be there to say \u201CI told you so.\u201D \r\n\r\nQuitting
    smoking sucks."

  body: " Chris--\r\n\r\nMay I suggest that you try Welbutrin: it's precisely the
    same thing as Zyban, but costs a lot less (especially if you have health insurance).
    It doesn't curb your desire to smoke: instead, it allows you to \"put off the
    gratification of smoking\"...which is to say: Hey! I want a cigarette. Naaah,
    it can wait. And, in my experience, it can wait indefinitely..."

  body: "Chris - I quit smoking on Feb 25 of this year and haven't had a single cigarette
    since. Frankly, I'm somewhat amazed by it every day.\r\nI used a combination of
    Wellbutrin and hypnosis. But I probably could have done without the Wellbutrin.\r\n\r\nTwo
    hypnosis sessions a week apart. Plus, the hypnotist had me make some changes to
    my usual smoking habits two weeks before the first session.  (Changing brands.
    Snipping the cigs in half. Smoking only in a place outside I didn't used to smoke
    before. That kind of thing - to begin changing the mindset.)\r\n\r\nI experienced
    some big emotional changes for awhile.  Mood swings, bouts of melancholia, etc....
    But that's bottomed out lately.  Gained a little weight - twenty extra pounds
    just kind of appeared unbeknownst.  I figure I'll tackle losing the weight after
    my first anniversary as a non-smoker.\r\n\r\nI still have cravings on occasion.
    But the problem is I know I won't get the same effect unless I re-addict myself.
    One cigarette will just get me sick.  But re-addiction seems really f-cking stupid
    to me. \r\nFrank Zappa used to call tobacco his \"favorite vegetable\" - I know
    how he felt. I liked smoking.\r\nBut the cost in every way just became too high."
