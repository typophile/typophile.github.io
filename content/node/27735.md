  old trade journal <em>The Inland Printer</em>, I stumbled across the following column.
  I found it inspiring and wished to share it with all of you. Long? By internet standards,
  yes. But worth a read for so many reasons.\r\nAHL\r\n\r\n<strong>Have We Reached
  the End?</strong>\r\nThe development of the art of printing has been so great, the
  improvements so rapid, and the inventions pertaining to it so numerous, that those
  who can remember the old hand-lever, tympan, frisket, one-token-an-hour press have
  often forced upon them the conviction that the limit has been reached, and that
  it is a flight of the imagination to suppose of anything beyond. The doubter says
  \u201Caye.\u201D He stands upon the borders of a veritable wonder-land, and, looking
  within, fancies he sees, \u201CThus far shalt thou go and no farther,\u201D inscribed
  upon the desire and ambition of the craft. And he has much to sustain him in his
  belief. Especially within the last decade, the growth and possibilities of printing
  have been phenomenal, more so probably than can be claimed for any of the arts whose
  purpose is the elevation, the enlightenment, the progress of humanity in the broadest
  and best interpretation.\r\n\r\nTo trace the onward progress from the slow, crude
  and tedious labors of even a quarter of a century ago would be a task of almost
  insurmountalbe difficulties; nor yet is it necessary. We have the practical results,
  and they are sufficient. We touch a tiny lever with our finger tips, and blanket
  sheets fly from the press more swiftly than human tongue can count. The same machinery
  that prints, cuts, pastes and folds, with unerring precision, counts sheets as well.
  \ Human hands are out of competition in the race, and human muscles would fail before
  it had hardly begun. So perfect, intricate, and apparently self-assured has machinery
  become that it may almost be said to be endowed with the principles of immortality.\r\n\r\nNo
  wonder, then, that the skeptic hesitates to believe in a beyond. Every feature presented
  seems the embodiment of perfection. He contrasts the old \u201CAlbion\u201D or \u201CWashington\u201D
  of his apprentice days with the \u201Clightning changes\u201D of the press of 1886,
  and is perplexed. He well remembers the time when, as an ambitious aspirant for
  fame, he managed to set, correct and distribute his eight thousand ems in ten hours,
  and stands amazed at the latest record of the champions. He counts upon his thumbs
  the thousands of impressions produced by a press during working hours in the past,
  while he cannot upon the fingers of both hands the number of thousands worked off
  in the twentieth portion of that time in the present. He staggers in the attempt
  to lift the immense rolls of paper now used, and thinks humorously of the old-fashioned
  24 by 38 that came to him in two-ream bundles, and was fed by single sheets. He
  reflects upon the roller-boy, sees how entirely he is shelved, and how much better
  his work is done by brass, iron and steel. He whistles dubiously at the banishment
  of soft blankets, and is loath to admit that better work can be done with hard packing.
  He looks in vain for the wetting trough, and smiles when told that paper is now
  used dry. In place of the wooden quoins, shooting-stick and mallet he finds only
  metal contrivances that have to locked with a nondescript key. In the \u201Celectro\u201D
  department he finds simplicity has taken the place of mystery, and greyhound swiftness
  the slow, cumbersome movements of the tortoise. \r\n\r\nNor is this all. He cannot
  comprehend the cleanliness, the cog-wheel system of today. The dingy, creaking alley
  stairs no longer lead to a spidered rookery, yclept a printing office. The change
  from a \u201Csky parlor\u201D to one lower, well lighted and ventilated has been
  as perfect as it is pleasant. Health and comfort have been considered in all the
  arrangements. The floor is no longer a wilderness of ink-begrimed paper, or tobacco
  juice, and even the hellbox occupies a more dignified position than its old-boot
  namesake, formerly nailed to the corner of a dilapidated case. The glimmer of the
  tallow-dip has been superseded by the full blaze of electricity, an agency which
  will yet doubtless play an important part in the future development of printing.
  \r\n\r\nPractically, there has been no limit to its progress. Discovery has not
  only kept pace with, but outstripped both needs and desires. So it has been in every
  branch. The boiling metal has been molded into forms of beauty and utility; in fact,
  so much has printing trespassed upon the bounds of what was once called \u201Cart\u201D
  that even the graver finds in it a formidable rival. Rule, that but a few years
  ago was as unbending as a \u201Ccountry squire,\u201D now willingly yields to every
  curve of symmetry and beauty, shaped by the magic touch of the skilled compositor.\r\n\r\nAnd
  well, also, has the paper-maker done his part. The gloss, the smoothness, the tints,
  the toughness are all that can reasonably be desired. New fiber has been found and
  utilized, not alone to satisfy a craze for something new, but for the most realistic
  of uses\u2014cheapness\u2014a great desideratum, if coupled with merit, for the
  printer.\r\n\r\nIn a thousand and one of the littles that go to make up the grand
  total of success, the good work has been steadily going on. No one article can be
  named that has not been touched with the magic wand of improvement. Little, if any,
  that is crude remains to baffle intelligence or annoy the skilled workman. He simply
  wills, and it is done. So thoroughly has this been accomplished that it would seem
  as if the bounds of possibility had been reached, as if man had arrived at the limit
  beyond which only divinity can pass.\r\n\r\nIs this true? Have we really come to
  the end of the journey of improvement as a craft? Must we be content with what has
  already been done, and make no effort to attain a loftier plane? Has the past been
  greater than the present can be? Have the mines of invention been so deeply and
  carefully worked that no golden nuggets remain undiscovered? Has the plummet sounded
  the uttermost depths and left nothing of use to be yet made known? It would be galling
  to our pride to acknowledge this, even were it true, but fortunately for civilization
  it is not. It was, in fact, but as the rude foundation to the magnificent structure
  of today, as today will be to the years to follow, and he who believes that printing,
  the most useful of all the arts, has reached the <em>ultima thule</em> is strangely
  blind to its destiny and inspiration. There never has been and never will be more
  than a passing check to its development, because underlying its progress is the
  interest of all humanity, discovery, enlightenment, and civilization.\r\n\r\nWith
  every step measuring the notes of the march of human progress must the printer keep
  time. Every forward move has created the necessity of another and a greater; every
  meritorious specimen of the typographic art has created a desire and a demand for
  something still higher in the scales of excellence, something still nearer to absolute
  perfection. To meet this requirement, to keep pace with the demands of the age,
  calls for incessant vigilance and continued improvement in workmanship, material,
  machinery, and labor-saving inventions.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D questions the chronic
  doubter\u2014and the question is pertinent\u2014\u201Cwhere shall be found any power
  to assist in eclipsing the past, a more compact, cheaper motor than steam, a genie
  more potent than we now possess? Upon what depend these utopian dreams of the future?\u201D
  The answer is so plain that a printer, of all other callings, should never need
  enlightenment on the subject. It is whispered to him by telegraph, voiced to him
  by telephone, and Franklin gave him the \u201Ckey\u201D to its subtle mystery when
  he caught the lightning and fettered its wanderings by the chains of a master will.
  True, much, we deem, is known of it now; but our present knowledge is as nothing
  to its coming uses, the film it throws over an electroplate is but as the gossamer
  web to what the fabric yet will be. \r\n\r\n<em>Electricity</em> will yet come to
  the printer as the spiritual inspiration that illuminated the minds of the German
  fathers of the art, as the solver of mysteries to the student in our own century.
  Its touch is magical, and its range of use beyond all present human calculation,
  though each day increases our knowledge, and each new development gives us a clearer
  insight into future possibilities. Already it has achieved wonders; has given us
  the most useful of \u201Cplates;\u201D perfect and easy communication, be the distance
  what it may; has lighted our workshops as brightly as the noonday sun, and tuned
  our bells as with spiritual music. Why can it not do more? When we learn to control
  its forces, to make it entirely subservient to our wishes, may it not exceed even
  the most sanguine hopes of the \u201Cdreaming enthusiast\u201D? It runs other machines,
  and why not printing-presses? It produces in stable form the type, and why may it
  not supersede type itself? It duplicates \u201Ccuts,\u201D and why may not its delicate
  touches, mind-guided, engrave the cut itself? In a hundred ways it aids the printer
  now, and who shall dare to draw the line beyond which it shall pass?\r\n\r\n<em>\u2014The
  Inland Printer</em>, September, 1886.\r\n"

    instead that printing had degenerated and was in need of major reform."
