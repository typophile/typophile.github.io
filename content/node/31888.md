    by Jan Tschihold when he was trying to find the formula that was used on incunabula. '

  body: 'The diagonal red line where it crosses the diagonal black line indicates
    the left corner of your type/illustration box, send a horizontal line across and
    stop at the next diagonal, send a vertical line down until it meets another diagonal
    etc etc. '

  body: It gives the gutter margin. This one looks a bit anemic to me. It might work
    with a largish book.

  body: I generally use this model (in green on my avatar, known as the Villard diagram)
    to draw my text frame, then round out the margins to whole numbers, raise the
    top margin a bit, lower the bottom margin somewhat, and, finally, shift the frame
    1pica towards the outside edge to account for the binding.

  body: I'll take back, or at least qualify, my comments. I actually do like these
    proportions for reasonably-sized books (larger than mass-market paperback). I
    think the size of the gif on my screen (the size of a miniature book) was what
    set me off.

  body: The red line shows that the golden ratio section also accounts for the left
    corner. The red lines start at the point defined by the golden ratio. It's just
    making the relationship clear.

    Smythe-sewn. If it is perfect-bound or even notch bound, your readers will be
    digging the text out of the gutter.'

    types of bindings?

    mainly Tschichold (<em>The Form of the Book</em>) and Bringhurst, but that PDF
    looks quite good as well.

    a bit. \r\nI guess it works if you use a binding method that allows a book to
    lie open flat."
