  body: "Bank of America used a custom typeface called, ironically, Higher Standards,
    but I believe they\u2014like NatWest\u2014stopped using it within the last five
    years or so (I last worked for them in 2009). \r\n\r\nBoA\u2019s identity typeface
    is Franklin Gothic.\r\n\r\nHigher Standards was a Clarendon (numeral)/Century
    (letters) hybrid that I thought worked quite well with Franklin Gothic, but it
    was eventually relegated to being used only to set long-form copy before it was
    dropped completely.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've done graphic design work for several regional banks. Some used to use
    custom fonts but they've all gone to standard fonts. \r\n\r\nThe reason I was
    told was that with many branches, employees, vendors, etc. their graphics departments
    got sick of constantly sending the custom font to people, and also seeing pieces
    done in the wrong font when the vendor didn't have the right one. \r\n\r\nIt's
    easier to say to a vendor \"just use [common font]\".\r\n\r\nYou'd think that
    employees could send it without bothering the graphics department, but most employees
    can't even pick the right color, let alone the right font. "

  body: "In Britain, NatWest recently rebranded with a [[http://personal.natwest.com/personal.html|rather
    chunky geometric design]] that I think may be custom.\r\n\r\nOther than that,
    most banks in Britain seem to use one rather generic humanist sans or another.
