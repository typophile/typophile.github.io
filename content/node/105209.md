  is my own website/product that's been established now since 2005. It's a book cover
  plugin for Adobe Photoshop.\r\n\r\nWould you combine these three words or make them
  separate in a logo? \"Cover Action Pro\".\r\n\r\nI've tried making the word \"Action\"
  thinner to create more contrast but it just doesn't look right and giving one of
  the words color looks strange.\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :-)\r\n\r\n-Mark"
