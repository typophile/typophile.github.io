  Armin Vit has a post about Ellen Lupton&#39;s revived <a href="http://www.designwritingresearch.org/"
  target="_blank">Design Writing Research</a> project... Among other things, there
  is an <a href="http://www.designwritingresearch.org/archive.html" target="_blank">Archive</a>
  of articles and interviews. Some of the interviews are previously unpublished, such
  as the one with <a href="http://www.designwritingresearch.org/frere-jones.html"
  target="_blank">Tobias Frere-Jones</a>, or unedited versions of published ones,
  like the <a href="http://www.designwritingresearch.org/hoefler.html" target="_blank">Jonathan
  Hoefler</a> interview. Both of these interviews date from the mid-1990s and make
  for some interesting reading.
