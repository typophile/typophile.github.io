  it's an all caps bold paired with something (slightly) similar to Mostra for the

  body: Yep, neutraface is right - the titles face could be custom? here's another
    sample...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4400.jpg]

  body: "I guess masthead is a custom work. May be you could start with a condensed
    sans which shares a similar global design, like [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/DIN/fonts/|DIN]]
    (condensed) or [[http://www.dafont.com/bebas.font|Bebas]] and tweak it. \"Only\"
    need to move up or down some crossbars and redraw /R bottom left part (extra work
    on /M for Bebas and probably longer work on /R for DIN Condensed).\r\n\r\nEdit:
    having a look to your new sample, the slightly tweaked /S (middle transition moved
    up) could confirm they've started with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/engschrift/|DIN
    Engschrift]] ([[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/din-1451/|1451]])."

  body: I think you're right - looks like they started with neutraface for subtitles
    and created a complimentary bold caps custom job for the header/main titles. Nice
    job, not too keen on that S though... thanks for the help!

    of art-deco font "inspired by travel posters of the 1920s".'
