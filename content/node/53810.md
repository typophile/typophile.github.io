  body: But do the French pronounce it in the Latin manner? Paul Hewson also uses
    a Latin name (Bono), but we don't pronounce it in the Latin manner.

  body: "I would guess that it is pronounced just like how the French pronounce <em>vox</em>
    in the phrase <em>vox populi</em>, that is, as [v\u0254ks]. It is a near rhyme
    of <em>box</em> in some accents of English, but the vowel is closer to the quality
    of the vowel in <em>sort</em>."

  body: "I checked with a French typographer/linguist friend, and he said [m\u0251ksimilj\u025B\u0303
    v\u0254ks] (that \u025B\u0303 is supposed to be a nasalized vowel; it shows up
    correctly in the editor window here, but not when I preview). So the <cite>vox</cite>
    is indeed as the Latin."

  body: Or as the French pronounce the Latin (like Jongseong had it; v, not w), right?
    Thanks for checking, speter.
