  body: "This seems to be a mix of ideas from Art Deco/Moderne styles. The B is like
    Braggadocio, several letters are like Bust in the Solotype books. It resmbles
    Glaser's Baby Teeth in some ways. I couldn't find one typeface to match it all,
    so it's tempting to guess it was 'inspired' by several older styles from that
    era.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
