  the user even chose), where the typeface was outlined, and it morphed from one typeface
  to another. It was great for demonstrating how different the shapes, x-heights,
  sizes, set-widths of varying faces can be.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I'm talking
  about? And if so, please point me back to that website!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPaula"
