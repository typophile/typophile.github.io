body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I have no formal education in arts or typography, or
  anything related :-) I'm noodling on the design for a novel. The paper is 6in by
  9in and the cover art was given. There are also illustrations for each chapter (which
  always open on the recto page), which I've used to open a chapter; the illustration
  covers the whole page to give it enough room.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for all sorts of
  feedbacks, please. Things you like, you don't like, I shouldn't do, I should do
  better, I did well. Anything that'll make the book better and help me understand
  book design and typography better.\r\n\r\nThe PDF is [[http://savage.light-speed.de/cry-ma-ma.pdf|here]].
  It contains the cover and front matter, the complete first chapter, and some of
  the back matter. I hope that's enough to give you a feel for the book...\r\n\r\nThank
  you :) Any comment is appreciated!"

  body: "Jens, my level of expertise in designing novels is similar to yours, but
    I'll comment anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming you are designing for print. That blue
    text in the front and back matter should be changed to standard black. (In the
    back of the book, the blue ink is just a name.)\r\n\r\nPoetry: To my eye the poetry
    in the text has too much room above and below. But I don't really know what the
    rule here is.\r\n\r\nMargin: I would increase your gutter margin a little and
    decrease the outer margin by the same amount, maybe one tenth to one-eighth of
    an inch. I think that keeping your text away from the gutter will make each page
    look more elegant. I am not a fan of designers who say you should consider the
    whole open page as the art object. I think you need white space on each side of
    each page.\r\n\r\nCover: I realize you were given this. But if this book is marketed
    and sold on the internet, most people will be seeing the cover at postage stamp
    size, on Amazon for instance. Make sure everybody is cool with how the cover looks
    at this size. No surprises.\r\n\r\nCopyright: In the U.S. I see the year after
    the copyright symbol, not after the name. You are probably covered either way.
    But you do need a year for Kathryn's copyright, so just put 2014 in there somewhere.\r\n\r\nCredits:
    I would move the copyright info to the top of the page and give everyone complete
    credit. This would also clarify everything. Something like this:\r\n\tCOVER CREDITS\r\n\tCover
    Design by Aileen Shih, website.com\r\n\tCover Art \"Magic Lady\" by Kathrynxxxx,

    Designer, website\r\n\r\nSmall Caps: Maybe \"TIN SHED\" should be in small caps.
    I guess it depends on how big the sign is.\r\n\r\nStuff I don't know about: Check
    with the printer. Do pages with full art need to have a bleed submitted in the
    PDF?\r\n"
