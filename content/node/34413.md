    suggest starting a thread in the Build section. I'd like to hear the issues you're
    having. But it seems a bit off-topic for a job posting?  \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\nPS.
    \"Will NOT disclose\" LOL - do you live in Basingstoke? ;-) "

    line in Hawai'i, and they asked where we were from. When I asked\r\nthem in turn,
    the man muttered: \"She won't let me say.\" As much as that\r\nwas a conversation-killer,
    it was also a thinking-starter...\r\n\r\n(Your fault, Simon.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
