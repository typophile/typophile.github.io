  Obligations Pour La Roulette from the 1920s. It's unfortunately either overlapping
  or cropped, which makes it challenging... See the full poster here: http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/prints-multiples/marcel-duchamp-obligations-pour-la-roulette-de-5395849-details.aspx\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Duchamp_script_5471.jpg]"

    fancy ones in metal type.\r\nTo assist in identifying letters I tinkered with
    the image in the link to attempt to improve the signal to noise ratio in the green
    letters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unknownscriptD_5314.jpg]\r\nStill
    confusing.\r\nDon"

    body: Thanks, Don! I agree, it's a puzzler. It seemed to me less likely to be
      calligraphy, but that's purely based on gut-feeling... I was hoping that green
      "H" with it's flourish-y crossbar would help ID it...

  body: "The H was one of the few green letters I could separate out with any certainty.\r\nNo
    matches with my metal type references. But possibly a recreation of one of the
    fancy <em>engraved</em> scripts_ [Bickham etc] that are now fonted?\r\nDon\r\n"
