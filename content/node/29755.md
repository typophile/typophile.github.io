  can't seem to make head or tail of it, for some reason the program help tells me
  that i haven't actually got Golive installed (from within Golive!!??). Does anyone
  know any web resources for help, esp. in regard to CSS, layers etc?\r\nthanks \r\n\r\nNick"

    you tried accessing GoLive help via another CS2 application?\r\n\r\nI was at a
    Adobe web seminar recently, and was told there's going to be one more version
    on GoLive, but best to switch to DreamWeaver"

  body: "First of all, GoLive is a dead-end product. Adobe will be dropping it and
    Dreamweaver will be taking over. You might just want to start with DW.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    the best way to learn any of the programs is to start learnign HTML and CSS. Once
    you grasp the concepts of those, using the actual web editor becomes trivial.
    So, that said, don't bother picking up any books regarding DW or GL themselves.
    If you want a book, pick up one on HTML/CSS. If you are a complete novice, www.w3schools.com
    is a good place to start."

  body: "thanks for all the comments people,\r\n\r\nI take the points about learning
    HTML and CSS and switching to Dreamweaver. I know Dreamweaver and (very) rudimentary
    HTML and CSS and I realise switching to Dreamweaver/educating myself are better
    options but time is an issue and I don't have Dreamweaver, and as it's such a
    small quick job, I can't see the point in my boss investing in a license unless
    it's clear that more web work will be forthcoming (that said, wouldn't it be nice
    to have it as an option?)--> so Golive.\r\nI will try these list of links, thanks
    again for all your time and trouble I appreciate help on a dull topic\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"
