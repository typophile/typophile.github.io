    Kalman, Perverse Optimist</a>. Find it at the library or maybe borrow it from
    a friend. It really is a good read. \r\n\r\nAlso, Michael Beirut, among others,
    worked with Tibor Kalman. Michael mentions him in very appreciative ways. Here
    is a google search of <a href=\"http://www.designobserver.com/\">Design Observer</a>
