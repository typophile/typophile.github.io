  am writing an academic paper about typography and mass media. This theme also includes
  all information about typefaces. I have aldeady read a book, by Robert Bringhurst,
  but I would like to go further on this issue. So I found three books, those ones:\r\n\r\n
  http://www.amazon.com/Just-My-Type-About-Fonts/dp/1592406521/ref=cm_cmu_pg__header\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=pd_sim_b_2\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Typeface-Alexander-S-Lawson/dp/B005MWKQQ4\r\n\r\n\r\n,but
  I haven't choosen yet which one is more appropriate to give me more details about
  the uses of typefaces.  Has anybody know those books?"

    ([[http://www.salon.com/2011/09/20/just_my_type_imprint/|Relevant review]])\r\n\r\nI
    haven't read 'Anatomy of a Typeface.' (But I plan to at some point.)\r\n\r\nOf
    these three, 'Thinking With Type' would give you more details about the uses of
    typefaces. I think '[[http://www.amazon.com/Shaping-Text-Type-Typography-Reader/dp/9063692234/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1361638565&sr=1-1&keywords=Shaping+Text|Shaping
    Text]]' is an even better introductory text.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
