body: Vienna? no, Vendetta! a bit off topic, but just saw the move and thought it
  was fab. I'm not as much the font spotter in the theater as is our friend [[Mark
  Simonson]], but i did notice gill sans in a couple places -- how very british of
  them! anyhoo, just thought i'd creat a space for typophiles to vent about Vendeta.
  (extra points for individuals who can recreate the lovely alliteration using the
  most instances of the letter v!) ;^P

  body: Vell, not to be vindictive but I must aver that the predominant typeface in
    the movie is not Gill, but is verily the vaunted P22 Underground or ITC Johnston.
    The face is used in all the government signage and propaganda, and a light weight
    (which argues for the ITC) is even used in some of the government documents shown
    in closeup. It vexes me somewhat that my favorite type has been approprated as
    fascist symbol. An earlier thread posited Priori as a nice sinister alternative
    to Johnston. The film designers' only effort to make Johnston more threatening
    was to display it only in black and white or occasionly red. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/vtype.jpg]
