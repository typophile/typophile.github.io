  body: I have not noticed animosity against Times New Roman or Arial. They maybe
    over used by some people but they are useful fonts.

    Gyre Termes and TeX Gyre Heros and other such typefaces, though.\r\n\r\nWhy penalize
    the computer-illiterate?\r\n\r\nJohn Savard"

  body: "There's a common dislike of Arial among graphic designers who, rightly or
    wrongly, view it as Microsoft's tasteless embrace of a Helvetica substitute. I
    doubt that the general public notices or cares about this issue.\r\n\r\nThe bigger
    problem might be that many computer users have come to regard both Arial and Times
    New Roman as the ordinary, commonplace, colorless typefaces that are chosen by
    those whose lack of imagination prevents them from picking something else. I suspect
    this fate would have befallen any typefaces that Microsoft chose as the default,
    go-to serif and sans serif fonts.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has no reason to remove them
    from Windows and plenty of reasons to keep them. As you mentioned, they're popular.
    There are also billions of office memos, forms and other documents already set
    in these typefaces. Removing Arial and Times New Roman from Windows would likely
    cause mass hysteria in office cubicles around the world. Comic Sans would become
    the new default and civilization as we know it would end."

  body: Much of the general public doesn't care about this issue, and many businesses
    use these fonts too. Microsoft would be nuts to remove them. People who don't
    like them can choose to use other fonts.

  body: "There's a trend among avant-garde-ish graphic designers now of JUST using
    Arial and Times New Roman. I guess as a counterreaction to the explosive increase
    in the amount of fonts, it no longer being a special thing to have a unique typeface
    in your publication. \r\n\r\ne.g. most of: http://www.europaeuropa.nu/svepdf/europaeuropa66sid.pdf "

      for my thesis. For the same reason you mentioned. People might thing I am just
      one of many who sticks to those \"default' fonts, while I actually made an informed
      decision.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Times New Roman is a classic font, handsome, eminently legible and especially
    suitable for small print and economy of space. I wouldn't follow fads in this
    regard. Arial isn't beautiful, but it's used a lot on the web and therefore needed
    to render pages as they're created.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are faces ( but not
    those two ) I've removed from active duty to make room for imports."
