  shapes might be lurking. But while I do find the odd ff lig, st lig and ct lig in
  the examples of type in use, the specimen sheets themselves don't show them. \r\n\r\nDo
  they show up in a supplement edition, or a specific year's catalog?\r\n\r\nWhere
  should I be looking do you suppose?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    yourself a 1923 book. That's the seminal one. \r\n\r\nDoes the 1912 show full
    character sets? The sets in the 1923 show all f-ligs where applicable, and alternates
    for more decorative faces.\r\n\r\n-- K. "

    numbers.\r\n\r\nIt isn't as extensive as this\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/n1ke/163557166/sizes/o/in/set-690970/\r\n\r\n<cite>Now

  body: "James Mosley pointed out that Roycroft had some alternative characters. It
    isn't a text face though and I don't know that I approve of all of them. Hmmmm.
    \r\n\r\nMy goodness! -  but that font Lightline sure is pretty! It even reads
    well - far better than helvetica I would say, and interestingly it shares a surprising
    number of formal characteristics with it."
