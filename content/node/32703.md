  which featured the history of type in Mexico. I don't have access to any Graphik
  issues at the minute and really need this book as part of research I am currently
  doing for college. Sorry I don't know what issue it was but if anyone has any ideas
  what the name of the book was please do let me know...thanks,\r\nsarah day"
