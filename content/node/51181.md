  body: "\"Classic\" is probably hand written. Notice the difference in the 's's.
    First alt I can think of is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_blaze_std_italic/\">ITC
    Blaze</a>\r\n\r\n\"Original\" may also be hand lettered as many food labels are,
    but there are many fonts of a similar style:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/letterperfect/longhand_family_ot/\">Longhand</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Calliope\">Calliope</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/sudtipos/brisa/\">Brisa</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/sudtipos/tiza/\">Tiza</a>\r\n\r\nIf
    you're interested in type for packaging, you might also want to check out this
    newsletter on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/sep2006_a/\">soft
    scripts</a>."
