body: "[Using Windows Vista 64-bit, FontLab Studio 5.0.4]\r\n\r\nFLS runs very slowly
  when I try to edit diacritics with <em>_top</em> and <em>_bottom</em> anchors. This
  seems to be caused by the huge number of base glyphs included in my font project.
  These glyphs have the pairing <em>top</em> and <em>bottom</em> anchors and FLS seems
  to calculate something related to these pairings (but it runs normally when editing
  other glyphs).\r\n\r\nI believe there is a simple way to get around this: a Python
  script to change anchor names for selected glyphs. Something to, for example, turn
  <em>_top</em> into <em>_t</em> and later restore it back.\r\n\r\nThe problem is
  I do not know to write a single line in Python. Anyone could show how to do this?
  It also may be a good starting point to learn how to write codes.\r\n\r\n"
