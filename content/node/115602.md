  body: Too many copies/rip-off/clones on the market for this one and UltraCondensed
    Sans Serif is one of them. I guess you could go with Michael Gill's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/iris|Iris]]
    or David Berlow and Kelley Ehrgott-Milligan's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/empire|Empire]].
