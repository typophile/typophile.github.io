body: "Quick question from a newbie:\r\n\r\nSay I have a button that's 50 px tall.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen
  vertically aligning text within a button what's the proper top and bottom padding?\r\n\r\nShould
  \r\ndistance from top button edge to Cap height = distance from bottom button edge
  to baseline?\r\n\r\nOr does it make sense to add 1-2 pixels on the bottom since
  centered text appears lower?\r\n\r\nAssume a 37px tall button with 12px Arial.\r\n\r\nor
  should some other measure be used to vertically center it?"

  body: This kind of thing is probably best judged by eye. One variable would be whether
    the text is all caps or includes lowercase.

  body: I usually put things in the optical centre, which is as you say, slightly
    above the geometric centre. Judge by eye.
