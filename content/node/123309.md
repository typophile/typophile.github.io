  a previous set of books she has written \r\n(to keep a consistent style). Problem
  is I am dealing with a new publisher who doesn't know the previous font used.\r\n\r\nOriginally
  I had designed the cover with the font DTLElzevirTBook and it is quite similar,
  but not the same.\r\nHere is a screenshot of the font I am after (in the blue).\r\nThanks
  for any help with can give ;)\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nJason\r\n\r\n"
