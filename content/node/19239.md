body: "I have tried on several occasions to get InD CS2 to save a file as interchage
  format, .inx, so that it can be edited on a machine running the older CS version
  of InD. It saved the file just fine but I have never been able to open it (or have
  any of my clients or subcontractors) in CS. It just crashes no matter how simple
  the file is. It seems to involve a font issue but I have the issue when the only
  fonts I use are the Myriad bundled with InD so I don't get it. \r\nHas anyone had
  success using the .inx format and been able to reliably open it in CS without crashing?\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS:
  do we need the Phinney signal?"

    of mine have had problems. Dunno.

    Same goes for .psd versus .tiff.
