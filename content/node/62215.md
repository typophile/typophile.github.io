body: "Hello Typophiles!\r\n\r\n\r\nCallimachos - not Kallimachos :) -is a title font
  for jobs that need a hand-drawn, bold feel. \r\n\r\nMy main problem is that I can't
  speak Russian nor I am familiar with the Cyrillic alphabet.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to
  achieve the Cyrillic version looking at other font structures and apply the style
  of the others glyphs - bet it has many inconsistencies or/and bug.\r\n\r\nWould
  anyone help me, please, to correct the Cyrillic glyphs?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/callimachos_test_02_5_4145.jpg]"
