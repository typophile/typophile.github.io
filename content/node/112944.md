  font menu and scrolled all the way down to Zapfino before realizing that none of
  the fonts on your computer quite match the fluffy type visions in your mind. So
  then you head over to a wretched site like dafont.com, only to be confronted with
  an infinite number of terrible choices. What do you do next?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feather_fytd_5745.jpg]\r\n<em>source:
  [[http://fuckyeahtypefacedesign.tumblr.com/post/61475663645/theyre-plume-crazy]]</em>\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAs
  graphic design and typography instructors, we don\u2019t do a good enough job of
  showing you Places to Get Good Fonts. We don\u2019t put enough emphasis on the fact
  that PEOPLE actually make fonts (not trolls in a machine) and that purchasing licenses
  to good typefaces is an INVESTMENT. Like that shiny degree you\u2019ll soon be cradling,
  or the latest laptop you\u2019re holding out for as a graduation present, it\u2019s
  an investment into your burgeoning career. And folks: every time you steal a font,
  a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/41758172\" target=\"_blank\">pegasus loses its wings</a>.\r\n\r\nSo,
  where do you start? We know you\u2019re on a budget. We know that you don\u2019t
  have $1000 to shell out on some crazy huge type family with black italic small cap
  tabular numerals.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/smallcaps_fytd_5441.png]\r\n<em>source:

  your x-height high, young typographer, and take control of your typeface decisions!
  The following is not an exhaustive listing of every type foundry or worthy site,
  but perhaps it provides you with some good places to begin your font-astic journey:\r\n\r\n<a
  title=\"MyFonts\" href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Myfonts.com</a>:
  MyFonts is one of the largest collection of fonts. Both large and small foundries
  sell their fonts here, so the price range, and quality, varies greatly. I suggest
  subscribing to the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/\" target=\"_blank\">MyFonts
  newsletter</a> where your already bursting inbox will be greeted by a pleasant interview
  with a type designer and some lovely type specimens each month. The <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/specials/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Special Offers </a>page occasionally features some amazing deals,
  but remember, you\u2019re looking for quality, something you can keep in your toolbox
  and use again.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typedia.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Typedia.com</a>:
  Do yourself a favor and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/typedia\" target=\"_blank\">@typedia</a>
  to get the skinny on good quality, freshly released typefaces. Many of these featured
  designs are also competitively priced and the roundup occasionally includes good
  deals. If you think $29 is too much for one weight of a good typeface, then I ask
  you, what did you last spend $29 on? If you say a trendy striped sweater from Century
  21 then we\u2019re breaking up.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FontShop<a>:
  A huge library of high-quality fonts, you could loose a few hours or your life clicking
  through pages of their type specimens. Their <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/free\"
  target=\"_blank\">goodies page</a> is also worth mentioning, as is the amazing <a
  href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id448250130?ls=1&amp;mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">FontBook
  App</a>, available for the iPad.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typographica.org\"
  target=\"_blank\">Typographica</a>: a wonderful type resource, their yearly favorites
  postings offer a curated selection of new typefaces. Since the site has been around
  for close to ten years (more?), their <a href=\"http://typographica.org/category/on-typography/\"
  target=\"_blank\">past posts</a> are worthy of an afternoon of procrastin-- I mean,
  research.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fonts in Use</a>:
  An excellent resource for students, this growing archive allows you see fonts in
  action! Registered users are also able to add their own examples and the ability
  to search by industries, formats and typefaces also makes this a useful research
  tool.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lettering or script-inspired</strong>\r\nIf you\u2019re looking
  for a font that is inspired by hand lettering, here are a few places to start drooling:\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://positype.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Positype</a>: I don\u2019t know
  what cereal Neil Summerour eats for breakfast, but whatever it is, I hope his fonts
  are on the box.\r\n<a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">Sudtipos</a>:
  Ale Paul\u2019s fonts are already probably ON your cereal box, if you\u2019re lucky.
  Many of his fonts come with an insane amount of ligatures, which, when used by a
  Jedi master like yourself, can bring the type to life.\r\n<a href=\"http://lauraworthingtontype.com/type/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Laura Worthington</a> is another lettering artist and type designer
  whose type has all of the swashy goodies AND is quite affordable.\r\n<a href=\"https://p22.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">P22:</a> Not specifically hand lettering-inspired type, but P22\u2019s
  collection spans the gamut of text and display faces, many of which are inspired
  by specific historical periods or art trends.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Font Bros:</a> The quality for extended language support / OpenType
  goodies might vary but there\u2019s plenty of choices here and generally affordable.\r\n\r\n<strong>Text
  faces</strong>\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for good text faces, faces that you can
  use in your resume to <a href=\"http://amypapaelias.com/youarewhatyoukern.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">make you look smart</a> or in a text-heavy publication, here are
  a few foundries worth checking out (many of them sell their fonts directly on their
  site or via other portals like MyFonts or FontShop):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">TypeTogether</a>: TypeTogether\u2019s text faces are addictive.
  Their <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/freebies\" target=\"_blank\">Freebies</a>
  page draws you in with a sip from a few of their families, and pretty soon, you\u2019re
  just drunk on the stuff.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.typotheque.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Typotheque</a>:
  You can probably never go wrong here. Typotheque is home to many a super-family
  (Fedra, Greta) but they'll come at a heftier cost. <a href=\"https://www.typotheque.com/articles\"
  target=\"_blank\">Articles</a> on design and typography are worth a visit to the
  site regardless of your budget.\r\n<a href=\"http://okaytype.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OkayType</a>:
  Type designer and letterer Jackson Cavanaugh sports only a few lovely type families,
  but you should be familiar with his <a href=\"http://www.theharrietseries.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">web type specimen for Harriet</a>, a game changer for how web
  type specimens will / should exist, IMHO.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hvdfonts.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">HvD Fonts</a>: A nice collection of text faces, mostly sans, some
  free ones too (but, you get what you pay for).\r\n\r\n<strong>Open Source Fonts</strong>\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.google.com/fonts\" target=\"_blank\">Google fonts</a>: Like a
  greedy kid tearing open the Halloween candy bag after a night of trick-or-treating,
  Google fonts would seem to satiate every font geek\u2019s desires. However, typographer-lawyer
  Michael Butterick <a href=\"http://typographyforlawyers.com/why-google-web-fonts-arent-really-open-source.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">raises some important about questions</a> about the validity of
  Google\u2019s fonts as \u201Copen-source\u201D.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">League of Moveable Type</a>: A manifesto, a revolution, The League
  of Moveable Type is on a mission to provide quality, open-source fonts. A good collection
  but like the coolest, unsigned, hipstery, shoegaze, post-rock underground band,
  you\u2019re probably not the first one to discover them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampersand_fytd_4546.jpg]\r\n<em>source:
  [[http://fuckyeahtypefacedesign.tumblr.com/post/67465958701]]</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>A
  mention about web fonts</strong>\r\nUnless it\u2019s 1995 and you\u2019re rockin\u2019
  that grungy flannel shirt, you need web fonts! Consider the <a href=\"http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/web-development/the-best-places-to-get-web-fonts-for-your-site/\">myriad
  of options</a> for web font licensing: are these fonts available as part of a web
  font service with a monthly or yearly fee, are you charged per font use, or can
  they be embedded using @font-face? It\u2019s best to understand the terms before
  you purchase a plan or use a free one.\r\n\r\nHopefully this serves as a good place
  to begin your typographic odyssey. Choosing fonts is a lot like dating or winter
  coat shopping: you\u2019ll need to try on a few options before finding one that\u2019s
  just right. And sometimes, the journey is more important than the destination. Happy
  type trails!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<em>NOTE: This post was originally published on my
  course blog but I decided it would work for a wider audience on Typophile, too.
  It is intended for students and novices, no eye-rolling allowed, type nerds! </em>"
