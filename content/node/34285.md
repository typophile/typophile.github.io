    Mike Abbink at Wolff Olins did the finishing work on the typeface in 2004. But
    it is in the zip download available here: http://snurl.com/Inspira.\r\n"

  body: "Well, yes, it is. And I got that info right here on Typophile. See http://typophile.com/node/17999\r\n\r\nWhat
    neither of us knows (or do you?) is whether this was legitimately available at
    the time it was included in this package.\r\n\r\nIf this is not legitimate, how
    did they get a copy of the font? And why hasn't GE taken action?\r\n\r\nIt's my
    understanding that GE made this font available on their own website for free download
    and later pulled it. See http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002021.html#002021\r\n\r\nIf
    someone downloaded it when it was legitimately available, does that mean it's
    now illegitimate for those who have it?"

    the license probably does not allow further sharing of the font. One would have
    to see the license to be sure."

    posted delibrately or if someone made a mistake. However it was pulled, and I
    think reposting it without permissions is bad form, and probably illegal. '

  body: "Getting back to the original topic, what about <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?E2\">AG
    Book Rounded BQ</a>?\r\n\r\nAnd I have to confess that I'm a little confused by
    your question, Murat. When you say \"monospaced numerals\" I assume you mean that
    they will line up if you set them in a table, in columns, etc. If that is what
    you mean, most typefaces already come that way."

    but I had never noticed that about its numerals before.
