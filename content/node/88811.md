  body: riccardo, thanks for posting my previous posts. the question is, are these
    the same font? They all seem slightly different and the suggestions given weren't
    totally on the mark...

  body: I feel like if it was used on this many album covers, it must be an existing
    font right?

  body: "I think they are the same. Probably with some variants (or a lettering artist
    with a very consistent style). But since they\u2019re pre-digital, there is a
    very good chance that the typeface in question never became a \u201Ccomputer font\u201D."

  body: "riccardo,\r\n\r\nmany thanks on sharing your expertise, i'm sure you are
    right that it has yet to be converted digitally.\r\n\r\nif anybody knows what
    this font was called pre-digitally so I can maybe search for it in a Letraset
    book, that would be great too!\r\n\r\nbest,\r\ndanny\r\n"
