    Did something recently transpire?\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29508\r\n\r\n\"This
    started out as Herman Ihlenburg's (1882) typeface, Bijou. Fontbank digitized it
    as Bangle. Then Swfte, one of those companies who put out several \"1500 Fonts
    for a Pittance\" CDs full of ripoff clones, modified it to create the goofy font,
    Mexacali (yes, that spelling is correct).\""

    Columbus (1892) and American Italic (1902).\r\n\r\nMore info on Ihlenburg:\r\n\r\nhttp://library.rit.edu/cary/collections/hermann-ihlenburg-papers\r\nThe

  body: "A bit more .. Southern Software did \"Riccio\", no doubt a clone of Fontbank's
    Bangle, with SSI and SSK labeling. Somewhere along the line, someone internally
    renamed the SSI/Keypro Riccio to \"Bijou\", leaving \"RiccioDisplayScriptSSI\"
    as the PS Font Name.\r\n\r\nEdit... and just found this from a few months ago:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/95245"
