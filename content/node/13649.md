body: Photopolymer is a magical material which can be effectively "engraved" with
  a combination of your art, UV light and a chemical bath. It is frequently used to
  print digitally-set type and art using a [[letterpress]], and just like other letterpress-printable
  media must be mounted [[type high]] on wood or metal (such as honeycomb). [[Gerald
  Lange]], educator and proprietor of the <a href="http://bielerpress.blogspot.com/">Bieler
  Press</a> (and a good friend of [[Hrant Papazian]]) wrote an <a href="http://bielerpress.blogspot.com/2005/03/printing-digital-type-on-hand-operated.html">excellent
  book</a> on using photopolymer, by far the best reference work on the subject.
