  body: "Well, reCAPTCHA takes advantage of the fact that there is inherent distortion
    and reduction of quality of letterforms via the fact they were created before
    digital fonts and then scanned afterwards. In addition, they add further distortion
    to create variable letter forms. Now, while it is well done and puts captcha efforts
    to good use, there are still potentially interesting results that can be created
    via this contest.\r\n\r\nSo, is it possible to create a font that humans can read
    but computers can't (or have extreme difficulty with) without the added benefits
    conferred via reCAPTCHA? Ultimately, nothing we create will be able to stand up
    to a program written specifically for that font, but there is still plenty of
    room for creativity and kooky concepts. "

    is a hack because Captcha is such a lousy experience. \r\n\r\nAaron you're right.
    You said what everybody here was thinking. The key in a battle though is to create
    the kooky concepts. The machines will catch up. They always eventually do."

    computers had difficulty with. The exact reason why the computers had the difficulty
    is separate.\r\n\r\nAnd now I should come up with a real answer."

    when there was more action. I thought I'd add a technical perspective to the game:\r\n\r\n1.
    Clever fonts for captcha don't work. You can instruct the program to look for
    certain patterns in the text so as long as those don't change, it's really not
    complicated to break the captcha\r\n2. Animated captchas don't work either because
    you can easily extract and merge all frames in a GIF.\r\n\r\nSo the only valid
    concept thus far is to have a set of rules from which you can generate fairly
    different shapes so that a single program cannot deduce the rules."

    thing, heh. Although, you could use unconventional forms like blackletter or script
    to fool computers I would think. It would make it hard on people, though. I can
    barely make out the letters in some of those captchas.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_battle_38_madtype_3448.jpg]"

  body: "It just occured to me that if the purpose of the excercise is to allow the
    human to merely select a sequence of letters, say CBDD for login purposes, several
    lines of complete alphabets can by displayed with the letters to be selected indicated
    by color, underline etc. The  selection rule (color or  underline etc.) can be
    changed at random. For example the instructions for CBDD would be \"choose the
    bold letters shown within asteriks\"\r\n\r\nAB*C*DEFGHIJKL...\r\nA*B*CDEFGHIJKL...\r\nABC*D*EFGHIJKL...\r\nABC*D*EFGHIJKL...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@tim,\r\n\r\nwell, I've two things to say:\r\n\r\n1.It's easy to code for
    such strings of letters and find the odd ones out. That even eliminates the need
    of 'reading' an image. And just to see how interesting the way softwares are working
    these days, try google sets!\r\n\r\n2. This battle is about \"creating typefaces\"
    which can be read by humans but at the same time, make it difficult for machines
    to figure it out. (And not about the solution to the real problem, there could
    be plenty.)"
