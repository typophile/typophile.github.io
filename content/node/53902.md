  signage of New Orleans is a great reflection of the creativity of the city as a
  whole. Many things in the city are family owned and run. These places are local
  favorites and play a big role in the city's culture. Dewitt's Fruit and Vegetable
  Shed is a perfect example of this.\r\n\r\nAnother way that New Orleans signage resembles
  the city's personality is through the use of nostalgic colors and symbols that resonate
  with locals as well as visitors. The Mardi Gras colors, purple, green and gold,
  are present in the Jacques-Imo's sign as well as a fleur de lis. These things remind
  people of New Orleans and the restaurant itself continues to do so with it's incredible
  food.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Post-Katrina New Orleans is flourishing by opening up new
  businesses, reopening old businesses and sprucing up everything in between. Tipitina's
  has been rocking this logo for a long time but their use of large and well constructed
  signs make it look even more professional.\r\n\r\nThese are just three examples
  of the different ways that the New Orleans signs portray the flavors of the city
  and its people. "
