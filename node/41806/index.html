The guy has written a memoir covering his life up to and including his time as a state legislator, and since joining the US Senate has written another book reiterating his past and stating his positions on major issues facing the nation and the world. Why is it so hard for people questioning his qualifications to skim them?

<div class=commentbody>I still have some reservations about the Obama logo. Initially I didn't like the non-gradient versions. The gradient version clearly reads sunrise, and works well on many levels. And it is a compact sign and symbol. All that is a real achievement graphically. But I am still a bit uneasy about the cartoonish aura about it.
Dennis [[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303303.html|here]] is an excellent article that captures what is great about Obama.
I have become a huge fan of his during this campaign. He's the best we've had for many years,I think. Of course, we can't be sure until he actually governs, but that is true for all of them. </div>

Capable of organizing a team of intelligent and creative people to come out of nowhere and get elected President of the United States of America? (I suspect we haven't seen anything yet.) Like it or not, this guy has already exhibited leadership skills far beyond anything we've ever seen in politics before. He's clean. It's like he's a applying for a job. Policies? I don't know.

<div class=commentbody>Right. Sorry. I contributed to steering this off topic. I read the article and agree with most of it, especially the top two being McCain and Obama. McCain's says Military. Obama's says "Welcome to the 21st Century," i.e. change. Critically, I think the Gotham is a weak choice because it is TOO soft, TOO dainty. Something suggesting a little more strength and stability would have been nice. Is Arno sturdier?

<div class=commentbody>Isn't that Gill Sans for the BarackObama.com?
His site uses mostly Gotham, which I think looks very strong and presidential, but the Gill on the bumper sticker is indeed weak. He and Rudy were the only ones who had urls on their stickers, which I suppose represents the future.
McCain's military look is appropriate given he thinks we'll be occupying Iraq for the next 100 years...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Koppa, "Obama" isn't Gotham. Gotham is what used throughout his campaign materials. That said, I agree with you that his name in the current serif is a little soft, but I love the logomark.
I just saw him speak in Hartford on Monday. He's got all his bases covered. He's so good...

<div class=commentbody>Has anyone else noticed that once Obama’s Gotham signs got popular the other candidates have been using it on and off? I see it a lot in their televised rallies, especially from McCain and (until yesterday) Romney.
It would be really nice if someone would start analyzing how boring it is for almost all federal-level campaigns to stick with the red, white, and blue color schemes. It can be really gorgeous when done well, but too often it gets combined with bad type and just looks like phony patriotism. Do campaigns in other countries tend to stick with the flag colors?</div>

Yeah. I got that right. In Germany you see black, red and gold (yellow) occasionally with conservative parties. But very subtle. Socialist parties stick with good ol’ red of course. Showing off national symbols has been a problem in Germany until maybe recently with the football (soccer for the U.S.) world championship in 2006, because of our history. I think even countries with the same national colors as the U.S. (France, the UK or Norway) don’t use them as exessively.</div>

The U.S. is long overdue for a rebranding. The current flag is great and all, but I can't help but feel like people would be less apt to, you know, burn it and stuff if it were more Web 2.0. </div>

<div class=commentbody>When we have candidates like Huckabee supporting the Confederate flag ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/18/huckabee-embraces-confede_n_82199.html ), I can't get too upset about all the American flag crap the rest of the candidates have.
With Hillary slipping in the nationwide polls, how long before the micro-analyzers at CNN invite a type designer on to explain how it's all the fault of her lame signage?</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite> ...her lame signage?</cite>
Har dee har. I struggle with children calling adults by first names, and even at age 39 I don't like to refer to my superiors by first name. Let alone a presidential candidate. To me, running as "Hillary" seems too much of a touchy-feely emotional plea. Let's face it, we're still at war and we still need an ass kicker in the White House. So, to move into philosophy for the sake of a "general discussion," is it the design of the sign, or is it just the "Hillary?"
As for the flag...I'm not so sure I ever thought it was that great of a flag. It's too 1770's. The U.S.S.R. flag was cooler.

<div class=commentbody>Here in Finland blue and white tend to dominate presidental election posters, but in other elections it's all about party's own colour.
Here are the last presidental election's final round candidates' posters:

<div class=commentbody>It's a sorry day indeed when Rotis Semi Serif wins an election...
On the other hand, the top ad doesn't look like a campaign ad at all. Might help if I could read Finnish.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The top poster says: The time of confrontation is over... The Workers' President. The candidate (Sauli Niinistö) is from the Coalition party, sort of Republicans, I suppose, center-right. Trying to win over working class voters but at the same time keep the old voters, upper middle class, entrepreneurs etc.
The winner's poster claims to be a President of whole of Finland – she was running for her second and last term, and has been one of the most popular presidents ever. Tarja Halonen is a Social Democrat.
It was a close race, and Halonen won. Niinistö is now the speaker of the parliament. He got in to the parliament with a record amount of votes and this campaign theme (Toivo=hope)

<div class=commentbody>Hi Pattyfab! I don't mean to be rude, but something's not right when you can make the following two statements in a single post:
[His] qualifications are quite clear and he is inspiring a whole new generation to vote... I just think that when we get into politics in this forum it doesn’t end up in a good place.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was responding to Dennis comment and then suggesting we leave our political views out of this forum. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, but it has gotten ugly in the past.
I don't see a problem with that. </div>

<div class=commentbody>A lot of people have little room for opposing viewpoints without getting angry. That is one reason political discussions aren't good in a forum like this.

<div class=commentbody>Just a couple of comments...
Change - for the sake of change? Give me a break.
Stop the Hustle.
Thank you.
And I think Hillary is squandering any Clinton cashe that would of easily refuted her opponent's hustle. Didn't a Clinton already clean up after one Bush? So why can't that be done again? Huh?? It's the economy stupid.
And you want what? Change? Why?
Get a grip, ok?
Hillary's graphic has failed - and Barack's has succeeded. McCain's graphic didn't matter anyway. And the rest don't/didn't have a strong graphic message.
And again, as for change... that's a whole lot of feathers, and not much chicken.

<div class=commentbody>I think its time for a time-out. This forum is about type not people's politics. Please send your remarks to one another directly. I was equally reprimanded at a bird watching site. I didn't follow the real focus of the site and I was embarrassed by my posts by the administrator. </div>
