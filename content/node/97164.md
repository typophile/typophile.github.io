    wonder if that applies here.\r\nThis would lend itself to statistical testing\u2014evaluating

    play with the P22 pack, but this is a different kettle of \uFB01sh.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cards_4213.jpg]"

    on a similar effect. I replicated Stroop\u2019s 1935 study, only I used fonts
    and font names instead of colours and colour names. Even to typographers, there
    was no effect of interference.\r\n\r\nhttp://readthetype.com/fonteffect/\r\n"

    I see no problem with Scrabbling effectively.\r\n\r\nNick, the P22 deck is annoying
    because, frankly, it wasn't designed very well. Sometimes, you need a little more
    than mere novelty\u2026"
