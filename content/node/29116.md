body: Do u know which fonts are totally safe to use on the web (any computer would
  render them)? Any good sites? I know about Times New Roma, Verdana and Arial since
  they are offered as options by Dreamweaver...

  body: Not 100% positive, but I think that Trebuchet, Courier, and Georgia should
    be near-universal as well.

  body: "Remember you can specify multiple options for fonts in CSS. The browser will
    use the first if it's installed, then move on to the second, then third, etc.\r\n\r\nSo
    you can specify an ideal-world font, then more common near matches, and finally
    just by sans or serif.\r\neg.\r\n\r\nfont-family: Avant-Garde, Helvetica, Arial,
    sans-serif;\r\nfont-family: Adobe Garamond, Garamond, Times New Roman, serif;\r\n\r\nBut
    given that Apples are less and less likely to have Microsoft products on, not
    sure you can rely on their fonts being present any more."
