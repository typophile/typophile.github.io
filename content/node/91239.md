  body: "Sometimes the shape & weight depends on the cut...\r\nAn an example, <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/futura/|Futura
    EF Medium]]</strong> looks like a perfect match to your sample,\r\nwhile Bitstream's
    <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/|Futura Medium]]</strong>
    is very different"

  body: The smaller top curve of the 's' is probably the most distinctive element
    in that small sample. Medium weights from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/t-medium/">URW++</a>,
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/futura/ef-medium/">Elsner+Flake</a>,
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/medium/">Neufville Digital</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/futura-futuris/pt-futura-futuris-medium/">ParaType</a>
    all look pretty close. Adobe and Linotype's medium weights have similar shapes
    but are a bit lighter.
