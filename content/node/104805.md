  body: "From the era of phot0-composition lettering. This is a 19th century style
    that was usually called French Clarendon. A MyFonts search using the term \r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%22reverse+contrast%22/fonts/\">Reverse
    Contrast</a> will show you some that are similar. The style is also lumped in
    with Wild West or Western. Also some at dafont in the Western theme category.\r\nDon"

  body: "Found an italic slope font where the letter forms, including the ear on g,
    are pretty close to the font in your image. It's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/western-sky//\">Western
    Sky</a> by Font Mesa. The term \"Italian Slab\" mentioned in the font info section
    was used in much the same way as French Clarendon to describe these reverse contrast
    fonts.\r\nDon"
