  body: Bill, that would be a great idea. I&#39;m very curious about this even though
    I do have something that is working. For instance, when I was using Font Reserve
    I actually had a list of fonts that the system needed and so I could &#34;get
    rid of&#34; the rest of them. I&#39;m happy with allowing Suitcase to manage my
    system fonts but I wonder if less system fonts would somehow equal more.

  body: As crazy as it sounds, I went from Font Reserve to Macs own Font Book. It
    is very well done and I have had no problems with it. The only downfall is auto-activation.
    I wonder if anyone has written a script of has a plug-in for it. <BR> <BR>

  body: In my experience, Font Book works wonderfully for previewing and organizing
    fonts, but I&#39;ve had limited success with the &#34;on/off&#34; feature set
    whereby I can disable fonts not currently needed and they won&#39;t show up in
    programs. My Adobe CS apps handle OpenType and MM faces just fine, but the standard
    productivity applications &#40;notably Office&#41; seem to recognize each variant
    as an individual font name

    <BR>I use Windows at work for two typefaces and a few others, so I don&#39;t even
    bother to manage my fonts on the machine and am pretty ignorant about it but I
    do know that Microsoft has a lot of inormation about type and I did a simple search
    from their main page for Managing Fonts and about halfway down on the results
    page are articles about font management. <BR> <BR>I am always baffled or mistrustful
    of third party FM utilities, so some explanations and comparisons from those experienced
    would be helpful. <BR> <BR>Jon'
