  am currently finishing some work on 2 font families and am having trouble with the
  display of the font in MS Word on a Windows operating system.\r\nFor some reason,
  the OTF fonts appear in the font menu but when I type, the letters are only displaying
  in white and without any possiblity to change the attributes?\r\nThe fonts display
  without any problems in all the Adobe suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, etc).\r\nI
  am not very aware of the Windows operating system so I am a bit confused as to where
  the issue is coming from..\r\nThanks in advance for any ideas..\r\n"

    designed other fonts that do work with Word? Have you tested the fonts with FontQA
    and MS Font Validator to look for configuration flaws?

    a Windows font cache issue, in which case rebooting usually solves the problem."

  body: "Thanks for quick responses!\r\nI am pretty certain the issue is not a design
    problem since both designs are very different... I must admit that no, I am not
    very experienced in exports for Windows, all my Mac exports have always worked
    fine with MS Word but I have not really gotten into the Windows side. \r\nThanks
    for the 2 font testers, I did not know them, I will have a look and see if that
    helps out..\r\n\r\nGood to know the cache issue too, did not think that could
    affect display in this way..\r\n\r\nWill have a go, thanks for the input!"
