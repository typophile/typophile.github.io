body: "Hi Everyone. I hope you can help me with this.\r\n\r\nThe font I am trying
  to ID is a relatively contemporary, square faced sans-serif.\r\nI am not sure that
  the \"A\" in this sample is accurate to the font; because of the way this has been
  used on a movie prop it is possible they \"tweaked\" the A to better match the source
  image.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/USPS_4881.gif]\r\n\r\nThis is
  a blown up sample of the original. The rounding on the corners might be a result
  of my blowing the fuzzy image up and sharpening it.\r\n\r\nThis is driving me nuts.
  I am sure I have seen this font before. I'm pretty sure I used it as a dry transfer
  lettering in the 1980's. It is also making me think of Star Trek.\r\n\r\nCan anybody
  help?"

    at the original, tiny, fuzzy image I am sure that is the original font. The \"A\"
    must have been tweaked to match the distinctive United States Postal Service logo."
