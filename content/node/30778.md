  characters total, doesn't really matter if they're not complete alphabets or anything.
  \r\n\r\nAnyone have any? Or know a good place to find some?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n-Gary"

    you posted this same request there, you'd get a few responses. There's also a
    LETPRESS group over at yahoo groups and you could ask there as well. Can't wait
    for the movie! --jimmy

  body: "I am dealer of used letterpress types.\r\nAnd I offer e.g. Helvetica:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/index.php?target=verkauf\r\n\r\nAnd
    I am dealer for Stempel, so I can offer new Helvetica weights.\r\nBut not '100
    characters' but complete fonts. But this is not cheap. \r\nFor the new types you
    have to calculate from 48 p\r\n1 kg - approx. 75 Euro\r\n\r\nAnd it can be shipped
    in anglo-american heigt.\r\n\r\nThe used ones are much more cheaper, but with
    a german height.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGeorg\r\n"
