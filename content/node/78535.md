    do you hint a font like that?\r\nAnd is there a website that already features
    the web-version of your font?\r\nCheers!"

    impressed by all the geometrical elements. So after that work on some illustrator
    brushes...and than afrobeat font born.\r\n\r\non myfonts you can buy the web-version.\r\n\r\ncheers!"

  body: "It's funny that you would tag this \"afro\", given that geometric type has
    a history going back to European modernism (Futura, Bayer Universal &c.) and Art
    Deco, and that in type \"afro\" is traditionally connoted by Koch's Neuland, and
    associated with pre-European \"ethnicity\".\r\n\r\nHowever, this is in no way
    a criticism. Perhaps the most geo font of all time was for the Mexico Olympics,
    connoting Aztec culture (and contemporary Op art).\r\n\r\nIf the afro beat is
    what inspired the font, go with it!"
