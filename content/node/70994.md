  body: I really don't like the body font. If you do want to go with a Web-safe sans-serif,
    try going with something a little more professional. I'd suggest Arial/Helvetica
    or Verdana and shrinking the letter spacing. Also, increase the line-spacing to
    give it some room--the design seems a little cramped.
