  body: "Well, I'd say you really should be working with much more organic imagery.
    Likely, actual letterpress printed type.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, do NOT use that
    stretched, skewed type. \r\n\r\nThis is a great book:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/New-Vintage-Type-Classic-Digital/dp/0823099598/ref=pd_bbs_5/002-3450317-6025637?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194620562&sr=8-5\r\n\r\nNow,
    that said, I agree with Blue and Manlio about the wood type/worn look, BUT...that
    really depends on what this letterpress shop is focused on. If they mainly do
    'fine letterpress printing' in the form of awards/certificates/wedding invites,
    etc, then the whole wood type/worn thing might not be quite appropriate.\r\n\r\nBut
    do focus on what makes letterpress appealing. It's a tactile medium. Show some
    texture in your imagery. "

  body: "Here is the letterpress \"about us\" given to my class:\r\n\r\n\"Operating
    from our home, we try to lend our signature touch to every project we work on.
    With ten years of letterpress experience, we have the skill to handle any job
    \u2013 yet our small size allows us to treat every customer like our only customer,
    providing the personalized attention you deserve. It is not uncommon for us to
    make house calls in Chicago to show paper samples, ink colors or to help with
    design. Mindful of budgets, our customers never have to sacrifice quality and
    preference for price.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide our clients with a special, one-of-a-kind
    product, most of our work is custom designed. Custom designs include your choice
    of design, color and paper.\" \r\n\r\nSince they do more elegant and custom work
    I was thinking of thinner type.  But I do like the suggestion of organic.  Would
    it be appropriate to use an old cursive letterpress font? If such thing exists?
    Similar to the text on the site, \"that wicked worn look.\"\r\n\r\nThank you for
    your help thus far. "
