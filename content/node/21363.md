    the diacritics with the small caps.  I am debating if I should release it alone
    first, or wait until I have regular and italic weights done.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nRRRRRibbitt"

  body: "Not much work on Froggy recently. \r\nIt has been a trying few weeks. I just
    got out of he hospital an hour ago. I was in three times in the last 2 weeks.
    The first time they put a STENT in one of my coronary arteries and sent me home
    2 days later. 2 days after that I was back in the hospital with chest pain. This
    time, they put 3 more STENTS in different arteries. They sent me home 2 days later
    and a day after that, I had serious chest pain again. Ruth called the ambulance
    and back I went. they did another Thallium stress test and blood enzymes and found
    out that I had a very minor heart attack so back I went to the Cath lab for a
    third poke in the groin. This time, they just changed my medications. At least
    now I am home again and looking forward to a hospital free week.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for asking!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "A stent is a kind of cylinder made of titanium mesh, flexible and open at
    both ends, inserted into arteries with weak walls or thin spots in the artery
    wall, to fortify the artery and encourage regrowth of the walls. When I had my
    cerebral aneurysm at the end of January this year the surgeons put stents in each
    artery (two) that burst inside my head. The complications and impact of the bleed
    episode, and brain trauma caused by the fluid pressure in my cranium---all that
    mess kept me in hospital for three months.\r\n\r\nI hope it all works out for
    you Chris. Sending you healing vibes and best wishes.\r\n\r\nI'm off to visit
    a musician friend in hosptal today. He just had a cancer removed from his brain.\r\n\r\nj
