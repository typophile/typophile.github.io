    but not a slab serif. Also similar to Century or New Century Schoolbook, but on
    steroids.\r\n\r\nA more recent typeface that replicates the look is Surveyor Black:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/surveyor/styles/\r\n\r\nAlso
    found this online, which is much more refined (also, not finding a match to it):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1395be_6386.jpg]"
