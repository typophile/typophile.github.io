  I think Even though they may fit with each other (and with the V, too), they have
  so little to do with the other 21 letters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nOr am I wrong?
  Does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm working on a small family, and these letters
  are worst, in every weight!\r\n\r\nOK, I'm done with my rant now. You may now return

  body: W is very important to me. My last name would be even more bizarre wihout
    it. However, I will say that I have noticed that some designers have difficulty
    with them, especially the W. And those who do have a problem with W generally
    have a problem with M as well.

    are just bothering me at the moment. I'd rather draw oodles of more S glyphs than
    these guys\u2026\r\n\r\nM is a little better in this case. My m's are straight
    sided, so they are sort of like the N, just wider (ad with a fourth stroke). But
    the W is diagonal. Actually, the whole face is sort of straight, except for these
    wacky diagonals coming in at the end."

  body: I've noticed that, in a lot of typefaces, design fatique seems to set in around
    T or U, and the rest of the alphabet gets handled perfunctorily and unimaginatively...maybe
    because S is usually quite demanding. Maybe V-W-X-Y and Z ought to be the first
    letters you do...

    it seems strange, since the shape itself is so very simple. I guess with type,
    the more simple it suppose to look, the harder it gets to do :)

    But do you mean graphic designers or type designers? I think there is a big difference!\r\n\r\nI
    guess, Miss TIff, that you have spent your life looking at either WARDLE or Wardle.
    In both instances the 'A' or 'a' would quickly  show the 'W' to be either too
    wide, too narrow, or poorly kerned! I bet this narrows down which typefaces you

  body: I see it more as which letters need therapy. C drowns in low self-esteem,
    it's missing its other half, and has always wanted to be an O. And u is just an
    ungainly thing, half an m but upside down. You'd think there would be some spiritual
    "cup" metaphor since it looks up to the sky and is theoretically collecting rain,
    but it can't compete with n, the lower case n, which although being the u upside
    down still has nice feet, very nice feet, and is connected to the earth.
