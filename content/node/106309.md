body: Found this font several years ago, on some website where you could create your
  own 'signature'. They didn't say what fonts were being used, but I could never forget
  this one. So far, I've been unable to ID it. Hope someone here can find out what
  it is, or something really close to it. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/rebekah_sig_3420.png]
