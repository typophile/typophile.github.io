body: Hi there, does anyone have an idea as to which font is used in this logo? It
  appears to have a grunge effect as both 'P's have the same 'crack' in them and the
  'L's seem to have the same lines below them as well. It looks quite similar to Identikal's
  BennuSans A, however that doesn't have the grunge effect and some of the characters
  have minor differences. I've been looking around for a while with no luck so far,
  I hope someone here can help!
