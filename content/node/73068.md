body: I'm looking for a good font sample creator, web-based, or for Mac.  I don't
  want to use a Font Manager, because I've had bad experiences with them.  Any ideas?  I
  am interested in whichever app will create the best display layout for samples.

    don't currently have a template or feel like creating one.
