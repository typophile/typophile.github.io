body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to take the book Grid Systems and learn Joseph M\xFCller-Brockmann's
  approach to setting up a functional grid but I am having some troubles with his
  examples and was hoping someone could shed some light on what it is I am not understanding.\r\n\r\n1.
  When I look at his examples in the book or any of his work the head line, body copy
  and captions all line up to my eye from the same baseline. Is this correct?\r\n\r\n2.
  In his examples he writes things like 20 pt head on 4 pt lead. Would this be 20
  pt font size and 24 pt leading in my inDesign type pallet? I know this is a stupid
  question but when I set up three text blocks side by side in inDesign it doesn't
  look like his examples.\r\n\r\nFor example he says 20 pt head on 4 pt lead(20pt
  on 24pt) with body copy set at 10 pt with 2 pt lead(10pt on 12pt) and captions set
  at 7 pt on 1 pt lead(7pt on 8pt) and then nothing lines up.\r\n\r\n3. I have my
  text box set at Cap Height since he says your first line of type should fit in the
  grid at the cap height. Is this wrong?\r\n\r\n4. In his examples he has his breaks
  for the vertical spacing margins starting the top margin line at the base of the
  descender in the above line and then the bottom margin line at the Cap Height of
  the line below. Is there a formula for figuring out the height to the break?\r\n\r\n5.
  Am I just not understanding how to set things up in inDesign.\r\n\r\nI think it
  would be fun to understand how his grids work as I really am attracted to everything
  Joseph M\xFCller-Brockmann has done. Can someone please help me out with understanding
  how to work this out.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time and help.\r\n\r\nMark"

  body: "It's hard to diagnose your specific problems without seeing examples, but
    the vertical spacing you mentioned sounds about right. Using 20pt type and adding
    4pts of lead (as in physical strips of lead) would equal a total vertical line
    height of 24pt. This is usually written 20pt/24pt and spoken 20 <em>over</em>
    24.\r\n\r\nMuch of what you're asking is, in the end, subjective.  I know designers
    who prefer to laterally line up with the x-height of letters rather than the cap
    height. And some of my teachers who studied under M\xFCller-Brockmann point out
    that he often used blindingly tight leading on <a href=\"http://www.internationalposter.com/artpick.cfm?SortResults=Title&ArtistNumber=450&ArtistName=Josef+Mueller-Brockmann&ResultsFormat=thumbnail&ShowPosters=Show+Posters\">his
    posters</a>.\r\n\r\nI suggest that you play around with the numbers until it feels
    right to you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "1. It depends, but generally this is how it\u2019s done. That doesn\u2019t
    mean that there\u2019s anything wrong with text not aligning to a common baseline,
    but doing so can make a layout seem less ordered.\r\n\r\n2. 24 points of leading
    in indesign should be the same as 20 points type with 4 points of leading. If
    things don\u2019t look exactly the same it may be because you\u2019re using digital
    revivals of the fonts, and they may not have the same proportions.\r\n\r\n3. That\u2019s
    up to the designer, but again, that\u2019s how it\u2019s usually done.\r\n\r\n4.
    There are plenty of forumlae for page margins, you should be able to find several
    in any book of typography. In the end the size of margins will be driven by a
    lot of factors, including paper budget.\r\n\r\n5. Maybe. If you really don\u2019t
    think you understand indesign, put Muller-Brockman aside and read an indesign
    manual first."

    the copy set to align with baseline grid then they should line up, with a bit

  body: "If you are having problems trying to recreate examples using his quoted dimensions,
    it's probable that the points he is using are not the same size as the points
    you are using. I think I'm right in saying that one point only became exactly
    1/72 of an inch with the apple Mac. Can anyone back me up on this? Since he is
    describing pre-dtp technology, he is probably using the didot point.Have a look

  body: "Brockman\u2019s points may be pres-postscript, but it shouldn\u2019t matter.
    Even if the point sizes are different, the proportions should stay the same as
    long as Mark is just using points/picas for everthing and not converting it all
    to some other units.\r\n\r\nMark, do you have text set to align to the baseline
    grid in the document? If you accidentally turned the baseline grid on, and only
    for  some of the text, that could keep things from aligning."
