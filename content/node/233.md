body: I have written a restricted rebuttle to Niclolas Barker&#39;s rebuttle to Mike
  Parker&#39;s question in Printing History.  <BR> <BR>My confinement is to the matters
  involving the Lanston Type Company and some presumptions advocated by Niclolas Barker.
  <BR> <BR>Admittedly I was a little more than annoyed that Printing History would
  not allow corrections published in Printing History journal <BR> <BR>I expect that
  bitterness shows in my writings. However there is some humour and hopefully clarity
  if you have a copy of Printing History, issue 37. <BR> <BR>Finally there is a bit
  of a question at the end. <BR> <BR>I am only posting this because I have been plagued
  by people interested in my input. <BR> <BR>I will not settle the Times, Burgess
  question. I have no such intention. Times New Roman is the property of AGFA/Monotype.
