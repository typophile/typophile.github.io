  majority hand drawn.\r\n\r\nMouse over for the film's title card: http://tinyurl.com/yjj2y6a
  \r\n\r\nPart of a massive collection of Film Title stills assembled by Dutch web
  designer Christian Annyas. Not the usual homage to film title sequences themselves,
  but of the moment when the film's title and hence it's type treatment is first revealed
  in the sequence.\r\n\r\nBrilliant sleuthing, kudos to Christian."

    glorious monochrome. And also some great movie titles such as \"Young Man with
    a Horn\", \"Dark Passage\" and \"The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse\".\r\n\r\nIt would
    be good to see the same done for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing_Studios|Ealing
    Studios]]."
