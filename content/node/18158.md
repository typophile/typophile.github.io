  body: "I think you may have accidentally tilted your guideline. (You can do this
    by holding down the command key while dragging the guideline.) If you right-click
    on the guideline and select Properties, you can see if the angle is 0\xB0 or if
    not set it to 0\xB0."

    the command key - maybe my daughter....  "
