body: "Howdy,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for help with a font installation problem in OS X.
  \r\n\r\nI'm an editor currently doing a job in InDesign. The chapters are coming
  to me via ftp...no problems there. However, I don't have some of the fonts I need.
  The designer (who's also using OS X) has uploaded them to her ftp site, where each
  displays as a series of stuffed files and a few empty files (e.g., \"0 KB\")\r\n\r\nWhen
  I download them and run them through Stuffit Expander, I end up with LWFN files
  which the computer refuses to recognize. They're greyed out in Font Book's selection
  window, so adding them that way doesn't work. Dragging them to the various folders
  doesn't work, either. I'm assuming I need FFIL files, but so far neither I nor my
  designer have been able to dig them up.\r\n\r\nObviously, we're doing something
  wrong, and it's probably something pretty basic. But I have no clue what it is.
  I'd be eternally grateful for any advice anyone might have.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Sounds like you're using old OS9 fonts. Ask the designer to Stuffit the fonts
    before he/she uploads them. (This way the information contained in the resource
    fork of the font files won't be lost when they are uploaded. Stuffing the files
    will temporarily transform their resource fork into a data fork 'format', which
    other OSes can read. In other words, the files won't show up having a zero KB
    size.)

  body: "Here's the short explanation of what's going on:\r\n<strong>Resource Fork:</strong>
    The PC and Mac differ in the way they store files. On a Mac [Classic] each file
    can have two parts called forks. The <em>data fork</em> holds data (text, images,
    etc.). The <em>resource fork</em> holds resources (icons, fonts, menus, sounds,
    etc.). There are actually two files linked to one name in the file system. PCs
    only have one file linked to each name.\r\n<strong>Fork:</strong> A fork is a
    stream of data associated with a file name in a file system. Macintosh HFS files
    have two forks. PC FAT and FAT32 files have one fork. NTFS files can have many
    forks.\r\nhttp://www.asy.com/glossary.htm\r\n\r\nAnd here's the long one:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork"
