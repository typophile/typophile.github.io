  who'll soon be opening a caf\xE9/bar here in Duesseldorf. It's a simple \"just for
  fun\"-thing i'm doing for free. The font is inspired by (often handpainted) bar
  and shop signs I saw in Italian towns like bologna, verona etc. last summer. \r\n\r\nThere
  are some inconsistencies, i'm still trying out different things\u2026 but what do
  you think so far?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHanno"

    really solid and well executed. Have you thought about making a lowercase as well?
    Your friend could typeset other signs and things like that with it for inside
    his caf\xE9. \r\nReally nice, it has personality, while being quite straight and
    geometic-looking at the same time."

  body: "Nice work. I wonder if you might play around with slight optical reductions
    to the strokes in the lower case a and e to open the counters. They look too bold
    in relation to the other characters. \r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that your tail
    to the Q is the best solution. It is okay, but why not try for something a bit
    more unexpected?\r\n\r\nThe lower counter spaces in the capital M feel too cramped.
    How about a little optical compensation to open those wedges up? The flat point
    doesn't need to be so wide, which could give you some wiggle room.\r\n\r\nThe
    middle diagonals in the cap P and R, and the upper diagonal in the Capital K,
    and the tail of the lower case g could be slimmed slightly. They look to heavy
    in relation to the rest of the character. The counter in the tail of the g is
    too small.\r\nAlso, how about a bit more space under the dot of the i? It is starting
    to look like an l.\r\n\r\nHave you ever studied the stroke width measurements
    in Cooper Black? He must have done the whole thing by eye, since no two strokes
    are the same width. But they all look perfect together. Sometimes I think the
    computer causes me to over-trust measurement, and my eye gets lazy.\r\n"

  body: "Fantastic typeface! I really love this style/period - I feel like these faces
    are making a big comeback. It's very well executed too. I'd love to see it released
    for public use.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I agree with slimming the diagonals on the
    P, R, and K - they look fine to me - if you're going for a monoline face, I think
    you've nailed it. The tail on the Q definitely needs some exploration.\r\n\r\nAny
    punctuation in the works?"

    lot of work on this after the bar opened, but I'll get back to it soon. For the
    bar we only used the caps, so the lowercase is pretty much just thrown together.
    I'll try to post some more pictures (like flyers, the menu etc.) if you're interested.\r\n\r\nI
    have to say, you're really encouraging me to go further with this, so I'll rework
    some of the details and keep you updated on the development soon.\r\n"

    to you, so here's an update:\r\n\r\nRekord WILL be released, most likely with
    some additional styles and possibly maybe cyrillic (don't you think this design
    just screams cyrillic?). I'm currently looking into that. Since I've got a lot
    to do with other stuff (most of all [[http://www.typophile.com/node/37489|Tramway]],
    which is also supposed to be published as soon as possible), I can't exactly tell
    you when I'll be ready, but I'm working on it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I thought
    I'd share some pictures with you: These are from a student project by Dirk Heider
    in Basel, who did a corporate design for a wine merchant. I really like what he
