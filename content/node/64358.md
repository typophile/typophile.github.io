body: "Hi, im currently involved in a graphics project at uni where i have designed
  a typeface and now have been asked to design a type specimen poster.\r\nWhen designing
  the typeface it was required that we link the it to a theme and I chose the title
  'motion'  i explored human body motion and related each letter to the shapes in
  which the human body makes when in movement.\r\nIts required that the type specimen
  poster has some sort of connection to the theme, full set of characters and a supporting
  typeface.\r\nI have done a couple of mock ups, and would really appreciate some
  feedback! Tell me they are good, average or absolutely rubbish, just please say
  why :)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://yfrog.com/j3typespecimenj\r\n\r\nhttp://img688.imageshack.us/img688/6632/specimenposter3.jpg"

  body: "The type needs to be the focus. Right now it looks like the images of the
    people could be included in the character set of the font. Are they? \r\n\r\nShow
    the type at various sizes. It looks like this is a display font, so I'm guessing
    it's not meant to be scaled down too far. This is your chance to show off how
    you intend the font to be used.\r\n\r\nYou can always look at the specimens for
    other fonts for inspiration. [[http://new.myfonts.com/|MyFonts]] would be a good
    place to start looking.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Hi, no the people arent included, they are just the link to the title 'human
    body motion' and they spell this out! maybe this isn't clear enough?  \r\nyeah
    its a display font, hence the option for using a different text for the body which
    i haven't developed how im going to do yet!\r\n\r\nthanks for the response"

  body: "I liked the typeface. I loved the drawings.\r\nI like the Layout on the blue
    specimen because the gestures explain the typeface and communicate the concept
    nicely. Maybe Penn has a point though! So make the drawings a companion dingbat
    font :D\r\nMy other concern is that if this is a standalone piece it should really
    clearly say that it's a font. I don't want you to fake a foundry and pretend it's
    published but at least try to spell out the fact that it's an experimental typeface."
