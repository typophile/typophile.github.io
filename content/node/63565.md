  feedback and ideas.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm planning on using Utopia for the body type
  (also used in the nameplate) and Franklin Gothic for headlines and other things.
  Are these choices too cliche for Newspaper? Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nOld:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Old_5374.png]\r\nNew:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beacon_5019.png]"

  body: "Regarding the nameplate, it seems to me that \"The Valley Beautiful\" don't
    connect well with \"Beacon\": italic and roman are clashing a bit and there isn't
    any apparent alignment.\r\nI don't know if Utopia is too clich\xE9, but I would
    avoid using the same typeface for nameplate and body text."

  body: "I think your version is a lot less outspoken than the old one (and therefore
    less recognizable)\r\nMaybe try to customize the letters a bit.\r\nI also agree
    with Riccard0 about \"The Valley Beautiful\". \r\nBecause it's all caps the top
    (cap height) is a straight line, a possibility might be to put \"The Valley Beautiful\"
    along it.\r\n\r\ni don't have Utopia and didn't take any time to make it look
    good but this is what i (more or less) mean:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beacon_4189.jpg]\r\n\r\n[Marvin]"

  body: "The nameplate above would be right-aligned. (I realize you couldn't have
    know that.)\r\n\r\nWhat the problem with using the same typeface though? Doesn't
    the Times do this? I don't want to stray too far from the old nameplate (keep
    the serifs).\r\n\r\nI feel there is a little disconnect also, but I'm partial
    to the italics.\r\n\r\nI tried a couple of versions with \"The Valley Beautiful\"
    on top, but I'm hesitant to make it look so traditional. I realize that is a risk
    though.\r\n\r\nAll input is welcome. I've never designed a nameplate before, and
    I'm quickly realizing it's a bit different from a typical logo.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Ah, I automatically presumed that it would be center aligned\r\nWith customizing
    I meant just a little bit like the A in the original\r\nMaybe (and this is a huge
    guess) you could align the ends of the words \u201CThe Valley Beautiful\u201D
    in the same slanted way as the italic itself goes and make the left vertical of
    the B follow that same line\r\n\r\nAgain a very ugly example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beacon2_4607.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Marvin]"

  body: "I threw a more traditional setup together:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beacon2_5234.png]\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think? It would be centered.\r\n\r\nI think customizing the type is good
    idea. I'll see if I can come up with anything."

  body: I think you should keep the B the same size as EACON. Then center it.

  body: "Hi Brett, \r\n\r\nI've always felt using the same font for a header or logo
    as for the body copy lessens the impact of the masthead or logo by reducing the
    contrast between the two, giving a homogenous, plain look.\r\n\r\nI realise it
    is early stages, but have you tried mocking up an entire page with the masthead
    in place?\r\n\r\nNice job, good luck!"
