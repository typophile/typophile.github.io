body: Trying to match the font in the banker4life.net logotype.  If you can&#39;t
  see the attachment, see <a href="http://www.banker4life.net"> banker4life.net </a>.
  The types I&#39;m trying to match are the text &#34;banker&#34; &amp; &#34;life.net&#34;
  and the number &#34;4&#34;, obviously. Any help you folks can offer would be great.

  body: It&#39;s ITC Eras but it looks to have been adjusted. <BR>Maybe condensed
    some. It&#39;s looks like the Demi weight. <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-eras/"

  body: Holy crap. You guys are amazing. <BR>Sorry for posting it a second time, Safari
    keeps saying that it couldn&#39;t access the page, but it&#39;s apparently working.
    <BR>Thanks so much. <BR>I&#39;m in awe.

  body: That&#39;s not Safari, that&#39;s the forum engine backfiring. When it happens,
    check the topic you were trying to post to before trying again. It usually has
    gone through. The engine has trouble retrieving the updated page for some reason,
    that&#39;s all.
