  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello eyeryone!
This time my client is an industrial designer who has come up with a cross between a portaledge (in case you have no idea what that is, check this out: ) and a treehouse. A portable treehouse.</p>
<p>The chosen name for this miracle of workmanship is &ldquo;Cambai&rdquo;, which is an alternate spelling of &ldquo;Kambai&rdquo; a tree-living tribe from Indonesia that build their dwellings at a height of vertigo-inducing 30 - 40 feet of the ground and, you probably guessed it, the sound of &ldquo;come by&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The product is built with rather soft curves, I chose to reflect that in the logo as well. A maple seed is hinted at in the shape of the &ldquo;b&rdquo;, which is a symbol the designer chose herself. She felt it reflected best the closeness to trees and the idea of being able to move to another location at any given time.</p>
<p>I have had some fun with the letters, but unfortunately I have reached an impass. It is not yet finished, but I can&rsquo;t for the life of me think, what else to change. Your input is therefore very much appreciated!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow I like it. I&rsquo;m not a type pro but I think if you make the &rsquo;m', &lsquo;b&rsquo; and &lsquo;i&rsquo; a bit more italic the logotype reads easier and therefore would look better.</p>
<p>Also would tinker on how the letters are connected especially the a - i at the end looks odd to me.</p>
<p>I like what you have done, it has a lot of personality.</p>

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I have tooled the connections extra sharp on this on, hoping to achieve more clarity in smaller sizes. I have noticed that if I try to connect everything in handwritten letters they way it should be connected - with soft transitions that is - things start looking a little swimmy. Like with this one I designed a while back:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SoftDiner_Circles_full_5825.jpg]</p>
<p>I will try to change the axes as you suggested, I&rsquo;m curious if that will improve that logos flow.</p>

<p>An intriguing idea. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how that would work, but it had better be a foolproof design or they&rsquo;ll spend all their time in court being sued by families who had a child fall.</p>
<p>My brother fell out of a treehouse when he was a child. Needed 6 stitches on his head; he was lucky he wasn&rsquo;t killed.</p>

Hope your brother did not suffer any lasting damge from his injuries.
If you are interested in how the finished treehouse looks, you can take a peek at it here:

		<div class="commentbody">I love the way it looks, but frankly I&rsquo;m having trouble with the <strong>m</strong>. My eye keeps reading <strong>canibai</strong>, <strong>caiubai</strong>, or <strong>cawbai</strong>. If this were a familiar word such as <em>camera</em>, I think readers would decode the letter easily from context, but because this is an unfamiliar word, readers must decode it letter by letter, and the <strong>m</strong> may trip them up.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Victor!
Thank you for your input. I believe that readability problem might be fixed by attaching the foot connectors of the &ldquo;m&rdquo; a whole lot higher, will try it out in a bit. My concern is, that it might adversely effect readability in smaller sizes. But hey, let&rsquo;s give it a shot. ^^</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>He healed up just fine.  Thanks for asking.  But his accident is scary to me in retrospect because during my life I&rsquo;ve had 2 friends who broke their necks due to falls and both ended up paralyzed. So I&rsquo;m very wary of falls. Even a relatively small fall can break a neck if you land wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link; your treehouse looks very cool, almost like a space ship. I&rsquo;m sure kids will like it.</p>
<p>Hard to evaluate safety without examining it in person. I&rsquo;m glad there is netting over the windows. My main concern might be how well the fabric holds up. The description says &ldquo;weather resistant&rdquo;, but all fabric deteriorates over time when outside. Even heavy-duty commercial awnings can eventually rip.</p>
<p>But anyway it looks like a nice project; good luck with it.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;m&rdquo; seems upside-down, and it should connect to the &ldquo;b&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now this may not look it, but redrawing that m so it connected at the top really turned out to be quite a challenge. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far:</p>
<p>I connected the b to the rest of the logotype, which I had not done initially as its shape was supposed to stand out. The maple seed thing. I changed my mind about that, so now it is connected.</p>
<p>The m is &ldquo;turned around&rdquo; as always, I am not entirely sure about the incline. Is there any kind of rule or a guide for finding the axes of something as non-geometrical as this lettering? If so, I would certainly love to read it, this is always giving me a hard time.</p>
<p>Also, Hrant, you mentioned some of the beziers not being so good. Could you elaborate on that a little? I would like to do as good job as I can and if you have any pointers to share I would be keen to hear them!</p>
<p>I have attached the latest version complete with nodes and outlines. 
Thanks for your feedback!</p>
