body: Forgive me if this has been discussed, I looked, really I did. I&#39;d like
  to add the Euro to my fonts and I&#39;d like it to be in the correct unicode and
  keyboard command position.  <BR> <BR>Can someone either point me to a tutorial or
  let me know how to do this? I&#39;ve been using the currency symbol position and
  I know that is ghetto. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Matt

  body: Hmmm. I think I will let somebody else try to handle this, since I haven&#39;t
    built those formats in FOG since before the euro was even implemented. <BR> <BR>But
    I fear it will not work well, seeing as FOG also hasn&#39;t been updated since
    then. I&#39;ll bet they don&#39;t support correct Unicode encoding of the euro,
    for instance. But maybe you can build an old-fashioned single-byte TrueType font
    with the euro at decimal 128. <BR> <BR>Hoping somebody else can help out! <BR>

  body: Piece o&#39; cake Matty . . . <BR> <BR>Add another slot by opening Font Info
    box on the font and make it 257 at the bottom center of the window instead of
    256 and click OK . . . You&#39;ve just added a new character slot. <BR> <BR>Then,
    scroll down to the bottom where your new slot is &#40;It&#39;ll be labled as &#42;&#42;
    always&#41; and paste the referenced Euro from the currency slot &#40;where the
    original should be&#41; to the new slot. &#40;command&#43;g&#41; <BR> <BR>Then,
    with the new slot hightlighted, hit &#40;command &#43;i&#41; to get info on the
    glyph and change the Character Name to &#39;Euro&#39; and the encoding to &#39;$20AC&#39;
    <BR> <BR>You should be able to export it out in both formats from FOG. <BR> <BR>Stuart
