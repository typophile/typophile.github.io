body: "I'm hand lettering a wine label and always seem to end up with to much air
  inside the \"C\" in \"Ch\xE2teau\". (Probably cause I'm such a lousy typographer!)
  So, I'm wondering if you know any examples of a ligature combining the two letters.
  \r\nObviously, there is no need for a ligature to spell out the word, but I'm playing
  with it to achieve a decorative look. "

  body: Sure. They're mostly in Latin American typefaces, as Spanish considers Ch
    to be one letter, but Porchez incorporated one into <a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/CostaPTF>Costa
    PTF</a> (you can see it in the sample on the page). You can see one in <a href=http://www.tipo.net.ar/pdf/chaco_v1.0.pdf>Chaco</a>,
    and a really fascinating capital CH lig in <a href=http://www.tipo.net.ar/pdf/Lineare_Serif_v1.0.pdf>Lineare
    Serif</a>. And a Google search of Typophile (which next time you may want to do
    before posting :-) ) turns up <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/20590>this
    thread</a> on the same subject.

    litigate?\r\n\r\nAlso... When I was a kid, back in the early 70s, there were a
    few two-letter combinations that had the same status as single letters -- in Spanish.
    <strong>Ch</strong> was one of them. <strong>Ll</strong> was another. In Spanish
    dictionaries, words beginning with \"Ch\" (\"charco\") or \"Ll\" (\"lluvia\")
    had their own section following \"C\" and \"L,\" respectively... But in the late
    90s, or maybe in 2000, the Real Academia Espa\xF1ola demoted these double-letter
    characters, and they no longer enjoy the same status as the rest of the letters
    of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nSpanish link: http://www.elcastellano.org/consultas.php?Tag=alfabeto"

    as so many are overwrought. That isn't to say it shouldn't be done or can't be
    done or that I've not seen it and loved it. I'm just saying that it is something
    to do with caution and attention. Don't do it because you have a ligature, do
    it because it is the  natural and right thing to do. "

  body: "Nicely put Tiff!\r\n\r\nMy advice regarding ligation would be to think about
    the balance of the c as it is written and to think of it in 2 strokes not one.
    Think also about the heavy serif you sometimes see hanging on a Cap C. It's often
    there for a good reason - and seeing that reason may translate into a better ligation.\r\n\r\nBut
    to echo Tiff further get the relationships of the letters right. Look at the white
    spaces. Look at what reads easily and feels natural vs what feel bullied into
    shape."
