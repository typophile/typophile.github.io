  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I recently received my membership renewal from SoTA. It is hard to support a phantom organization.
Has SoTA ceased to exist? It seems they do nothing anymore. Other than the wonderful Ampersands for Haiti project, they seem to be in a coma.  Last year, the somewhat ho-hum TypeCon program was barely posted before the event and this year is no better. By now, everyone should know who the speakers are and what the conference will cost. A Professional organization should be run, well, professionally.

It takes a lot to get me to bitch on a public forum but sometimes only the squeaky wheel gets oiled.

I think it's really a case of having volunteers running the site who also have day jobs. Personally seeing the work put in by Michelle on the Haiti project and being hit up continuously (okay twice) for sponsorship by Jimmy-G SoTA seems to be as active as ever.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm also a board member. There is a lot going on behind the scenes. I actually spent part of my afternoon proofreading email blasts that are scheduled to go out next week. The call for submissions and venue information was included in these.

The conference itself is being held a little later than normal this year. It will be held a the end of August in Los Angeles, California. We're really excited about the location. LA has a great design community and so many good schools. We're working hard to re-vamp the education forum and to make this the best conference ever. 

At the end of January, the Font Aid project distracted us quite a bit. We made an effort to put the project together quickly. We still plan to post the PDF speciman book to Lulu.com for people to print-on-demand. 

Now that the Font Aid project is wrapping up, we're more focused on conference logistics and we plan to get more details to everyone very soon. We appreciate people being patient. The board members are all volunteers with busy day jobs, but we all care very much about SoTA and Typecon and want to see the organization thrive for many years to come.

They're volunteers. They're here out of kindness.

It's Christmas Eve.

As I said before, this was a sterling effort showing what SoTA CAN do.

I still am convinced that TypeCons prior to last year were much better publicized and sooner publicized than Atlanta and this year so far.
I am sure they can make a liar out of me for this this year and I hope that they do!

Bear in mind the degree to which the local community is involved.
That keeps things fresh each year, although it would no doubt be more efficient to trot out a standard package.

		<div class="commentbody">This year, I am one of the n00b members of the SoTA board.

I absolutely agree with the comments that communication and timeliness have been areas where SoTA has needed to improve. This year will mark my eighth TypeCon. From my own experience, any delay which prevents getting important information out to the community can often be a source of frustration. 

Speaking of delegation, one of my goals as a board member is to increase the number and the quality of these communications, particularly related to email blasts. We will be getting more information out to the community much faster and on a more regular basis as we move forward. I am dedicating a fair amount of my time specifically to this task.

I would also like to echo Juliet and Michelle’s statements that SoTA is actively working on several TypeCon-related announcements and updates. The general call for speakers (along with a call for the education forum) will be posted and delivered within the next week or so.

Naturally, any additional suggestions are always welcome.

(Thanks for squeaking Chris.)

		<div class="commentbody">And though the official call for speakers hasn't gone out, the program is already being discussed. Each year we make an effort to find interesting speakers in the local community. LA is providing us with countless interesting possibilities. Sometimes speakers approach us and sometimes we approach them. We've had several people already approach us this year who are well known in the Typographic community, but who have never spoken at Typecon. We're excited to have fresh faces on the program, but I don't think we can announce any names yet. I know that's a tease, but I don't want to make announcements until proposals are approved and people are 100% committed.

We're also putting together some great panel discussions including one Juliet is working on about post-graduate Typographic education in the US.

Feedback on our previous conferences is always welcome. After each conference we spend many hours discussing the conference, what worked and what didn't. As far as content we try to keep a delicate balance between history and technology, academia and industry. We're always curious how people feel about this balance and how we can improve.

		<div class="commentbody">Each year we have about 20 students who volunteer at the conference in exchange for free admission. Usually these are local students, but we sometimes have out-of-town students and a few professionals. It's a lot of work, but a great experience. We generally require that volunteers commit to 3 days of volunteering. The main conference sessions always start on Friday and we generally need the most volunteer help on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday before that. I've been the volunteer coordinator for the last 3 years. We formalized the process a bit last year and required volunteers to submit an application. I haven't updated the application for Typecon 2010, but hope to get it out soon. With students, it's sometimes hard to pin them down too far in advance.

For students who aren't able to volunteer, we offer discounted rates. In the next week, we'll also be announcing a new student award that we're really excited about.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Based on these posts, the bottleneck seems to be the outdated (also dangerous and standards-noncompliant) practice of “E-mail blasts.” Can’t you just run a blog, with updates every now and then saying “We’re not dead. We’ve got a big announcement coming up,” then run the big announcement? RSS (and the twit’s RSS, Twitter) will get the word out.

Essentially, nobody’s asking you to typeset a brochure in InDesign just to tell us what’s coming up in the next conference. This seems to be the comparable level of pluperfection that is holding you back.</div>

Nor will they subscribe to RSS feeds or actively engage via Twitter or Facebook. Yes, we should be more regularly ‘vocal’ through these other avenues (as described) … I’m not dismissing that at all. It’s just that email remains the single most reliable (and common) method of distributing (read: broadcasting) information in digital form.

The society has thousands of individuals signed up to receive information via their inbox (with more being added each week). We would be remiss to ignore this particularly powerful venue of communication. However, I promise that we will be spreading the word through Facebook and Twitter and other social channels. Honest.</div>

Last year's TypeCon was poorly attended, it's true, but I always assumed that was mostly due to the economy, and perhaps secondarily due to being in Atlanta in summer.</div>

That being said, I think TypeCon is awesome and always look forward to attending. I was really bummed at missing the Buffalo conference due to family medical issues.

You see the font, but you can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another TypeCon and you'll be mine, a one track mind

You can't be saved
ATypI is all you crave
If there's some tracks for you
You don't mind if there are two

That is exactly why I started this thread. I wanted the SoTA folks to realize the real needs of their constituents. I also wanted to emphasize that last years reduced turnout was not mostly due to the economy but it was mostly due to tardy registration announcement and proceedings. If you have to talk your boss into sending you on his dime, he wants to know in time for his budgeting and for someone to cover your work while you are at the conference. Bosses want to know, Who, What, Where, and When, How Much and Why is it worth the time and money? Simple business decision?, yes but an answer like "it will be great" but we don't know what "it" will be yet does not help sell it to the boss. Bosses just think, "What kind of a Mickey Mouse outfit expects me to commit time and money to "Guess what is behind curtain number 3"</div>

I mean you are after all, criticizing the speed at which volunteers can work for a non-profit organization on a conference you would not attend unless invited to speak, even if they'd hustled to your schedule and published the full proceedings back in January or something. :)
