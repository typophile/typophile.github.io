And if I had the time to put one big sticker over the whole thing, it&rsquo;d read: &ldquo;snot-nosed, typographically-tight-sphinctered, subjectivity-riddled, goose-stepping nags get nowhere on these issues with the people they are trying to &lsquo;help.'&rdquo; But, I think that is not their goal which seems trictly to show what &ldquo;great designers&rdquo; people should think they are.

<p>Sorry, but this is no longer valid. Editing and proofreading are fast disappearing. Everywhere. From major university presses to ad agencies to newspapers to . . . you name it.</p>
<p>We need all the eyes we can get on matter set in type. Including ADs' eyes and designers' eyes and typesetters' eyes. But do only the most obvious corrections yourself. Query all others on proofs and make sure you get answers from them what wrote the stuff in the first place.</p>

<p>To set the record straight, I lured them out. :^P</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;making people feel good about other people’s bad design&rdquo;, I really don&rsquo;t get your point.</p>
<p>I printed out the Visual Enforcement Kit, passed it around in the studio and we all had a good laugh. I didn&rsquo;t apply any sticker on anybody else&rsquo;s work and prolly never will. The thought never even crossed my mind. I think – no, I&rsquo;m convinced – that&rsquo;s what most people will do, and that&rsquo;s how it should be. Why always assume the worst?</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t shoot the messenger; the Design Police are merely commenting on the state of a lot of current graphic design. I don&rsquo;t believe them to be inherently evil. ;^)</p>
<p>Personally I feel that the pride I put in my work entitles me to be disheartened when I see sloppy, lazy typography. And I will accept criticism whenever I blunder. Humour is a healthy way to deal with these feelings. The day we won&rsquo;t be allowed to poke fun anymore at something that irks us will be a sad day indeed.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

I write &ldquo;constructive&rdquo; because it has reminded them of all the little things (inch glyphs used as apostrophes, faux italic, etc.) I keep bugging them with every week, and they realised I&rsquo;m just not the only nitpicker out there. So they agreed to let it pasted on the door as some kind of ironic &ldquo;check-list&rdquo; to look at before spending the school&rsquo;s budget in useless (and premature) printouts.
And I love the &ldquo;fire extinguisher&rdquo; look, with this awful lot of white Helvetica on red background.</div>

&hellip;and it was a very nice interview. But that&rsquo;s not the &lsquo;publicity&rsquo; I&rsquo;m talking about, as they were way out before you lured them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;making people feel good about other people’s bad design”, I really don’t get your point.&rdquo;
What point? the part where the stickers are used by people without your sensitivity and compassion? or the part where these other people use the stickers, anonymously and without corrective education to go along with the stickers? Or when the stickers are used to criticize non-typographic, in some cases non-design issues?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why always assume the worst?&rdquo; Because in the best case the stickers are never used, leading to great-looking white space. Really, totally brilliant white space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don’t shoot the messenger; the Design Police are merely commenting on the state of a lot of current graphic design. I don’t believe them to be inherently evil.&rdquo;
I don’t believe them to be inherently evil either. I&rsquo;m not shooting the messenger, the messenger&rsquo;s messenger or the messenger&rsquo;s gun. That leaves the bullets&hellip;many of which, in this silly case, are not even targeted at the graphic design, are they now&hellip;</p>

<p>Point made, I agree. But I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the stickers that are going to have people cross over to the Dark Side. I can play all the ultraviolent video games I want (which I don&rsquo;t, incidentally, just for the sake of the argument) and I still won&rsquo;t buy a gun and start shooting people in the streets. But you are right.</p>

I believe in policing the police as a general concept, so I can&rsquo;t bring anything against that, but I think I&rsquo;m hardly a &ldquo;typographic totalitarian&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s maybe ask some people who know me, I might misjudge myself completely. :D</p>

You sure can. But you can&rsquo;t drag me in and shoot at me without my cooperation now, or can you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t think these stickers are meant to be used at all by anyone, really.&rdquo;
Really!? In the repeating row of &ldquo;Kern This!&rdquo; stickers, is the first &ldquo;Kern This!&rdquo; sticker more or less &lsquo;funny/educational&rsquo; than the eighth, &ldquo;Kern This!&rdquo; sticker? If one were not supposed use them, then one would need but one of each, Sherlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take them for a shot at precisely the people who are all too often prone to dogmatic tight-sphinctered comments about other people’s work,&rdquo;
&hellip;then print the definition and remedy for each boo-boo on the back of the sticker, or somewhere in site. I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t need help to draw a line between &lsquo;Let it BE&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Let it B.S.&rsquo; But I&rsquo;ll try to do better ;)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

Sorry, Mr Berlow, but I disagree with you again on this one — I think the repetition of certain instructions is definitely part of the joke : &ldquo;Kern This!&rdquo; is precisely the kind of comment a tight-sphinctered typographer would make AGAIN AND AGAIN (we are all a bit obsessed by that, aren&rsquo;t we ?). 
I tend to think you&rsquo;re strenghtening my point, here.</div>

<p>Perhaps a tight-sphinctered typographer who&rsquo;s already inserted his head up the anatomy in question would repeatedly shout, &ldquo;Kern this!&rdquo;, and think it was funny, over , and over, again&hellip; But, the tight-sphinctered typographer with his head bent on typographic improvement says, &ldquo;Kern this 2 units tighter&rdquo;, or  &ldquo;Kern this 2 units looser&rdquo;, sticker, or not. See the difference? Really, I&rsquo;m not trying to strenghten your point for the time when it&rsquo;ll be an easier insertion for you. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, go ahead and repeatedly shout, just the &ldquo;Kern this!&rdquo; sticker, at a bunch of student projects. My guess is, they won&rsquo;t even laugh a little, the first time. :-o</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">David, I think that Stéphane&rsquo;s point is that finding objectionable kerning will happen more often as you look over designs than the others so it&rsquo;s natural that there should be more of them and that you would locate them on a page together. Not as you have it that you would either use ( or shout ) kern this repeatedly one after another&hellip;. Still, as you have no doubt deduced I could not condone use except among consenting adults.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m afraid my command of written English fails me here : in my opinion, these so-called stickers are obviously not meant to be used at all, even for fun. The joke (of Monty Pythonesque proportion, I would dare to say) here is the SUPPOSITION that they simply COULD exist — and that there would be morons to use them. Not a sane mind would even THINK about using them — so they are a way to poke fun at typographic ayatollahs, which implies a healthy dose of caricature (hence the multiple &ldquo;Kern this!&rdquo; provided on this FICTITIOUS &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo;).
I&rsquo;m a teacher myself and I wouldn&rsquo;t use this stuff on my students' work — but, as already told, I shared the joke with them and they did find the whole thing ludicrous AND funny.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The surest way to kill a joke is to analyse it, I suppose.</p>
<p>Still, I work in production, not design, and I get to look at author manuscripts and then (fingers crossed) improved typeset copy all day (and just occasionally I&rsquo;m able to nudge dodgy usage in a better direction, as in &ldquo;please do not break ‘analysis' after the ‘l'&rdquo; or &ldquo;please do not add hyphens to this URL at a line break&rdquo;), and I got a chuckle from this &amp; forwarded it to my colleagues. Of course we wouldn&rsquo;t dream of <em>actually</em> using it, but the fun is in imagining using it: and therefore the supposition is that there&rsquo;s such a lot of poor or non-existent kerning about that you&rsquo;d need a lot of stickers for that. (Hey, it got my boss to look up ‘kern'!)</p>
