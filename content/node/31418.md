  Oldstyle?\r\n\r\nIt was produced digitally by Bitstream, and before that a machine
  version was made by Lanston Monotype ... but I'm looking for the original release
  by Bruce Type Foundry in NYC. Pretty sure it was 19th century, leaning towards 1880s.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nTim"

    Typefaces by Jaspert, Berry & Johnston (Blandford) I find the following info on
    Bruce Oldstyle as they are showing a Lanston Monotype version from 1909;\r\n\r\n\"Designed
    by Sol Hess from the Bruce Foundry's Bruce Old Style No 20 which was first shown
    in 1869. The type is based on \"Scotch\" and similar faces.\""

    I'm doing in The Hague, based on a book I've found in a antiquarian. You can find
    original printings in the specimen of the Bruce Type Foundry 1869. As soon I've
    finished my essay I can send you an PDF via email.\r\nAnother source is pointing
    at the Old Style by Miller & Richards as a base.\r\nPlease watch as well: http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/bruce/index.html\r\n\r\nMy
    revival is based on the Long-Primer No. 20 and I'm not sure if I will add the
    italics and the small caps. The assignment was more about learning to do a revival
    than ending a finished type-family.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I was not able to find
    the designer or caster of the typeface.\r\nSo If you can help me in that case,
    would be grate."

  body: "Just looking in 'American Metal Type Faces' and the Jaspert et al. 'Encyclopedia',
    here is some guesswork about Bruce Old style. \r\n\r\nCaslon--the original type
    it seems--was revived in the 1844 printing of 'Lady Willoughby's Diary', and caused
    a big splash as people had been only reading 'modern' faces like Bodoni, Didot,
    and the Scotch romans. And some found Caslon more readable. \r\n\r\nCaslon was
    first revived by some copying process in 1858, by Laurence Johnson of Philadelphia.
    \r\n\r\nNot long afterward, in 1863, Franklin Old Style was cut by Alexander Phemister,
    at Miller & Richards. It is one of the first of many attempts to modernize Caslon
    and remove what was felt to be backward, but keep its readability. It has a more
    vertical stress, is widened, and has much shorter ascenders and descenders. Jaspert
    puts the date at 1860, and just calls it 'Old Style'. \r\n\r\nThis type was popular
    and widely copied. Though Johnson's Caslon was originally called 'Old Style' also,
    the types of this name in the 20th century on all seem to derive from Phemister's
    face, including Bruce Old Style--which was one of the early derivatives of Phemister's
    face. \r\n\r\nAccording to 'American Metal Typefaces' Bookman Old Style is also
    derived from a similar--or possibly the same--face also cut by Phemister, with
    thicker strokes. The Bookman we know seems to have come from versions by the Bruce
    foundry, originally called Antique 310. ATF added the famous swash characters,
    which were drawn by Wadsworth A. Parker. \r\n\r\nJust looking at it, there may
    have been an influence of Clarendon on Phemister's face--it looks like the offspring
    of a Caslon-Clarendon marriage. In any case, it is certainly a long-lived design.
    I think it has considerable merits, though it also has a certain dullness to it
    also.  \r\n\r\nAs I say all this is guesswork based on those two books. If historian
    James Mosley is around, I suspect he could tell us a lot more.   "

  body: "From my friend and colleague George Laws:\r\n\r\n\"The notion of a designer
    as separate from the punchcutter did not exist until the late 19th century. Usually,
    the master punchcutter was an independent craftsman selling his own products,
    though occasionally accepting commissions, that would presume input from someone
    else. Punchcutters did not need finished drawings, just a general sense of purpose.
    Most likely, George Bruce worked on the punches with other engravers in his shop,
    and he certainly did his own casting and sold the type under the Bruce Type Foundry
    name.\r\n\r\nThe Bruce type foundry became part of the American Type Founders
    \ in 1901, so I assume that more information on the history can be found in the
    ATF archives. That collection is now part of the Smithonian Institution. The easiest
    place to start would be to talk to David Pankow (dppwml@rit.edu) at the Cary Library,
    Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York.\r\n\r\nDavid is erudite
    and very helpful.\""
