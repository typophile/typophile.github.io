  body: It appears to be a manually extended, poor quality knock-off of something
    more or less Helvetica-like, so why not Helvetica Bold Extended...or are you really

  body: Ah, it's the lumpy curves that make it work here (eye of the beholder?) I
    did manage to rework it in illustrator and I think I have a pretty good version
    now, thanks for the response.
