  but the dots on the lowercase \"i\" an \"j\" are square not round. Does anyone know
  what it could be or where I might buy it? The uploaded images are Century Gothic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/centurygothic_6531.jpg]\r\nand
  the mystery font:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mysteryfont_6156.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mysteryfont2_4428.jpg]"
