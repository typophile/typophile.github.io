<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody> Hi all -- <br> <br>By Tuesday 20th August I have to know what there's to know about the German DIN fonts, i.e. Mittelschrift, Engschrift, Neuzeit Grotesk ... (I guess that sums them up?). <br> <br>At least I should give the _impression_ of knowing everything. :-) <br> <br>Any pointers to information? Considering the short notice, I prefer information on the web. But book titles you know of will be greatly appreciated as well. <br> <br>Soren O </div>

<div class=commentbody> At least I can tell you what DIN stands for: Deutsche Industrie Norm. <br> <br>The DIN-institute is an organ organ which defines norms. e.g. DIN-A4(!). Not only for printing, but for all kinds of industry. <br> <br>Jacques </div>

<div class=commentbody> Well, that much I knew ... and Fontshop's website offers a little info as well. For instance, the 'designer' credited is 'Linotype staff'. Is this another way of saying "We don't know the designer"? <br> <br>Of of the things I would like to know is what year the fonts was created. <br> <br>Soren O </div>

<div class=commentbody>The short answer: it was designed for the German <br>roadway. (DIN stands for the German Industrial Standard.) <br> <br>The medium answer: the different weights were not <br>designed at once, as a family (think the original <br>Helvetica vs. the original Univers). They're a loosely <br>related bundle of faces. Frankly, this becomes obvious <br>as you try to use them together. <br> <br>The solution: use the FontFont version. The weights are <br>all reworked (by Albert-Jan Pool) to maintain the spirit <br>of DIN (compare the Mittelschrift to the FF DIN family) <br>while creating a unified family. <a href=http://www.fontfont.com/shop/ target=_top>http://www.fontfont.com/shop/</a> <br> <br>If you want the full history just hope Erik Spiekermann <br>reads your plea. =)</div>

<div class=commentbody> Albert-Jan Pool gave me the following answer. (For your information, my employer is presently writing a book called 'Wayshowing' on the subject of signage, signage typography etc. This was the reason for my questions in the first place). <br> <br>QUOTE <br>thanks for your interest in the DIN subject. 1995 Erik Spiekermann asked me <br>if I would be interested in doing a redesign of DIN Mittelschrift, and have <br>it released by FontShop. We thought it a good idea to create a family of at <br>least 3 or fou weights. I came up with five, the medium resembles FF DIN <br>Mittelschrift in weight. The regular is suited for longer reading text. DIN <br>Mittelschrift is far too heavy for text. I started designwork by creating <br>the light and the black version, and took care that the medium, which was to <br>be generated by interpolation would be close to the original DIN <br>Mittelschrift. Most of this, and a lot more interesting stuff can be found <br>in the broschure &#187;FontFontFocus FF DIN&#171; available through FontShop. <br>You can also find some details on their website. <br> <br>Unfortunately I do not know who ever designed the original DIN. I made <br>several attempts, without any result. <br> <br>DIN was originally designed for signage. Most likely in the early thirties. <br>Most countries tried to establish industry-standards by that time. The <br>Germans were pretty much ahead by that time, probably because the fascists <br>were already thinking of streamlining everything for mass-production of <br>anything needed for the war that was planned. The idea was that most sign <br>makers would construct the characters by ruler and compass, and scale the <br>measurements from a grid. This was thought to be easy. Unfortunately this <br>theory ignores that most signmakers are quite good at drawing by hand. This <br>is one of the ideas behind FF DIN. It combines strict rules with <br>craftmanship and provides letterforms which are a bit more fluent than DIN. <br>FF DIN also has a bit more contrast in stroke weight, the horizontal strokes <br>are thinner than the vertical ones. Therefore it is a bit more readable than <br>DIN Mittelschrift. <br> <br>When you write a book about signage it would be interesting to contact <br>Gerard Unger. He knows a lot about it because he designed a typeface for the <br>Dutch traffic signs. <br>Also interesting: <br>http//:www.urwpp.de <br>URW has digitized a fair number of traffic types. They did the previous <br>dutch version (a derivate of the american one), also the spanish, the <br>danish, the french, and I believe also the english and the austrian ones. <br>They also digitized the original version of the american "highway gothic", <br>which is not Interstate. Interstate is a redesign. Some of them maybe not <br>available as postscript fonts because the character sets do not have <br>accents, currency symbols an so on. They were sold to Signus customers, a <br>former signage software package with an Ikarus-based proprietary fint <br>format. Signus used to be very popular because of its extreme accuracy. <br>Unfortunately the Windows version never really made it. But maybe they would <br>like to convert the missing ones when you mention them as a source in the <br>book. <br>UNQUOTE </div>
