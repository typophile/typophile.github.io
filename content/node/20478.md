    that looks like it belongs in the 1900's and has the feel of the wrought iron
    style. Not too ornate though, it has to be clearly readable."

  body: "for some reason, I haven't been able to get on all day today (was typophile
    down or was it just me?)\r\n\r\nAnyway... WOW! I had no idea there were so many
    options out there. Here's the rundown (my opinion only)\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Escrow</b>
    - Not quite curly enough (old looking)</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Precosia</b> - Very nice,
    might be a bit hard to read at smaller \r\n\tsizes, lightbox material</li>\r\n\t<li><b>American
    West</b> - Close, but a bit too cliche western looking</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Maverick's
    Luck</b> - Close, add that one to the lightbox</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Kilkenny</b> -
    might be a bit too light</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Missionary</b> - I couldn't have asked
    for a more exact font for what \r\n\tI asked, but it's too thin, too</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Calliope</b>
    - getting really close here, add this one to the \r\n\tlightbox too</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Eccentric</b>
    - I didn't even think of something like that, could \r\n\twork</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Berolina</b>
    - Again, a direction I didn't even think of, I love this \r\n\tboard!</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Cafe
    Corina</b> - VERY CLOSE! In fact, I plugged away in that site a \r\n\tbit, Billhead
    and Tyler are almost perfect. Added all three to the lightbox</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nOkay,
    I just got some further direction. The logo type will read \"Neverthelesser\"
    and it is to be a short animated film set in 1906 San Francisco on the day of
    the big quake. I think we have the typefaces here to work with, does anyone have
    any suggestions as to how to maybe mix & match them to make an interesting logotype
    for a short animated film?\r\n\r\nI would love you thoughts and thank you so very
    much for these suggestions. Huh, education can be fun! I guess my teachers were
    right all along. Who'd a thought?"

  body: "Hmm maybe search through the thread about historical resources. I posted
    a link to vintage SanFransisco Pictures and art. Could browse that and look for
    some inspiration. \r\n\r\nThat is a nice link of fonts from all the sugguestions!
    I was going to sugguest something from letterhead as well. But they don't have
    a typesetter so it's a bit annoying."
