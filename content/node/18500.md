  body: Agreed...I don't understand how this kind of stuff gets overlooked. It's the
    first thing I noticed!

    typeface. They were made to be free, so a little sloppy.

  body: I'd say this isn't House. House Gothic does have proper overshoots and that
    letter a alone is enough to know that this isn't of high enough quality to be
    worthy of House. I'd say it is a rip-off.

  body: "Oh it's definitely not House Gothic. Here's a close reproduction of the logo
    using HI Gothic Bold.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HG.gif]\r\n\r\nThe tails
    of the \"t's\" are less narrow/rounded. The \"e's\" are abit more squared and
    there's a few other differences. \r\n\r\nI'll agree it's a rip-off font, or it's
    been severely altered."

  body: Nah, it's a freeware font -- seen it before, can't remember where (actually,
    I don't <em>care</em> where). It's pretty poor quality, innit?
