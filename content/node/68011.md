body: "Finally got around to reading \"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\" set toward
  the end of the 1700s. The cover is fun, but inside is really interesting...the whole
  book is set in Baskerville \u2014and unusually, an entire page at the end is dedicated
  to one small sentence naming the typeface. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jonathan_strange_and_mr_norrell_cover_5613.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  loved it's hearty color, the way it seemed born to embody the story's visual voice,
  and fit so snugly with the setting, mood, syntax, etc... Cut to this week\u2014I
  tested a version of Baskerville I happened to have, and was utterly appalled. Horrible,
  useless stuff. Blech.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm curious as to what digital cuts or interpretations
  of Baskerville have good color, which feel right or have gorgeous swashes, etc,
  and which in the end just don't work?\r\n\r\nIs it really because so many digital
  Baskervilles strive for a fidelity to the matrices over anything else, and don't
  take into account real-world conditions like ink spread \u2014 and just end up so
  light and anemic-looking on the digital page? What versions <em>don't</em> suck
  with today's incredibly-refined, razor-sharp print technology?\r\n\r\nFrom Baskerville
  in his own words, in his foreword to Milton's Paradise Lost: <em>\u201CAmongst the
  several mechanic Arts that have engaged my attention, there is no one which I have
  pursued with so much steadiness and pleasure, as that of Letter-Founding. Having
  been an early admirer of the beauty of Letters, I became insensibly desirous of
  contributing to the perfection of them. I formed to my self Ideas of greater accuracy
  than had yet appeared, and have endeavoured to produce a Sett of Types according
  to what I conceive to be their true proportion. \u2026 It is not my desire to print
  many books: but such only, as are books of Consequence, of intrinsic merit, or established
  Reputation, and to which the public may be pleased to see in an elegant dress, and
  to purchase at such price, as will repay the extraordinary care and expense that
  must necessarily be bestowed upon them.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\n\"There\u2019s
  also a wonderful chapter on John Baskerville and the many versions of his typeface
  in Simon Loxley\u2019s Type: The Secret History of Letters; particularly take note
  of his comments on Fry\u2019s Baskerville, 'a piece of 18th century intellectual
  piracy'\"\r\n\r\n\"RIT\u2019s Archibald Provan \u2014 one of the greatest typography
  professors in the known world \u2014 confesses to wanting to be reincarnated as
  a font of 72-pt Frys Baskerville. True story.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A disadvantage of Baskerville 1757 lies in the fact that it offers nothing
    more than one weight with a corresponding italic. Moreover, some letter forms&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;\u2018f\u2019
    and \u2018g\u2019 among them&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;seem somehow questionable to
    me. But these are just theoretical caveats, I\u2019ve never seen it printed.\r\n\r\nA
    Baskerville worth considering may be the one by Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm: He
    offers a family called <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-22-baskerville-original\">Baskerville
    Original</a> containing display and text cuts as well as an additional \u2018Baskerville
    Ten Pro\u2019 set that obviously comes with an extended character set. Especially
    this latter one looks nicely dark in the specimen, on the screen at least. Unfortunately,
    I neither have any practical experience nor acquaintance on paper with this one,
    as well.\r\n\r\nThe longer I think about it, the more I get the impression that
    I\u2019ve hardly seen any book decently set in digital Baskerville. The anemic
    versions seem to be preponderant. Why? Maybe this is some sort of vicious circle:
    As the first digital versions of Baskerville turned out to fall short of what
    most people liked about metal Baskerville, popularity decreased, which, in turn,
    reduced the urge to create a better digital rendering soon etc. Nowadays I see
    bad Baskerville mainly in book series of publishing houses that haven\u2019t been
    reconsidering their choice of font since 1993&thinsp;\u2013&thinsp;contexts in
    which you are also likely to find anemic Bembo or anemic Sabon."

    novels. I could really only imagine a better Baskerville coming about if some
    person of means decided to publish the most beautiful books in the world, using
    the most beautiful type in the world, just because he can. Oh, wait\u2026"

    type (and paper and printing) was criticized as being too light and dazzling and
    sharp and anemic in his own time."

  body: "Adelphi, one of the best publishing house in Italy, always set its book in
    Baskerville - from metal Monotype in the Sixties to digital ITC New Baskerville
    in more recent years. The resulting quality is varying, depending on the grades
    of black, but I can say that ITC New Baskerville generally works well in this
    publisher's books (which are, interestingly, snobbish and very popular at the
    same time). Here's a small sample, found on the web:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/itc_new_baskerville_3858.jpg]"

  body: ITC New Baskerville is my all time fave quality text typeface, I feel it is
    the most "readable" typeface out there, but IMHO it is too far away from what
    Baskerville actually used in 1757 to be called Baskerville, especially the small
    letter "a" in ITC New Baskerville...I prefer the a in ITC New Baskerville, I feel
    its better, but it's too far away from the original Baskerville to properly be
    called that.....It should have it's own individual unique name.
