  out how the Featured Faces (Displayed in the forum topic titles for instance) are
  displayed, or embedded(?) I'm in the beginning stages of redesigning my own site,
  and am looking to explore some new possibilities.\r\n\r\nI've discovered some proprietary
  solutions for Internet Explorer as well as some others, but I'd really like to replicate
  the quality of the display as shown here at Typophile. How is it done? Are there
  any computability issues across browsers?\r\n\r\nAny direct help in terms of coding
  programs or links to useful material would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nBrock"
