  body: "I agree -- nice job. Few things: 1) Trajan is a bit overused, although it
    works well enough here (unless this is a different Trajan than Adobe's). I don't
    have any suggestions for a particular reason, but it seems to me that something
    with tension in it's letterforms might be good: <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-legato/>FF
    Legato</a>, <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-avance/>FF Avance</a>,
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian/>Sebastian</a>, and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/prensa/>Prensa</a>.
    EDIT: <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/shaker.htm>Shaker</a> and <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/enigma.htm>Enigma</a>
    go here too.\r\n\r\n2) The S is too loose, and I'd kern a bit tighter between
    the Y and L.\r\n\r\n3) I like that you didn't track the \"aviation and training\"
    to the full width of \"SkyLark,\" but I find it distracting that it lines up so
    neatly to the end of the R. I'd either line it up with the end of \"SkyLark\"
    or make it end somewhere in the middle of a letter."

  body: I feel that the small cap height is to large. About 70% of cap height mike
    work better. Part of the retention process of which is the essence of a good logo,
    is the identity to shape. Logos that tend to be more of an illustration are more
    difficult to work with. Your design is appealing, but how does it work in b/w?

    size BW version of a logo as well as a variation of it on the negative space.
    Please check that too.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise, thanks for all the opinions so far.\r\n\r\nOne
    more thing: I find this logo pretty much a great and straightforward idea with
    a bird casting plane shadow, but. I have to make it work applicable on plane's
    tail too... I know  I can just use the lark for it, but what do you think?"

    slightly different angle to the body and not symmetric. The reversed out version
    is a bit moth-like, it might be nice to continue the grad through the lettering.
    I would consider a different sans it seems a bit heavy next to Trajan. How are
    you applying the tailfin mark \u2013\_vinyl, painted on \u2013\_can it have halftone?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "<em>the wings appear a slightly different angle to the body and not symmetric.</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    doesn't bother me, because it reinforces the fact that the shadow is not the bird's
    per se. Larks don't have swept-back wings, but most modern airliners usually do
    (unless you want it to cast the shadow of a DC3)."

  body: "In the process of stylising you have created an illustration, and you should
    be aware that I and any other audience will not have the benefit of a photograph,
    the left wing is clearly not a pair to the right wing and the wings are not at
    a right angle to the body. Unfortunately photographs are not real life, they suffer
    from all kinds of distortions and this is a further distortion \u2013 it is an
    accepted technique to work from photographs but there comes a time when you have
    to view it as a stylised illustration and as such it is no longer a genuine representation,
    it needn\u2019t be a huge job to alter I would suggest you try it. By the way,
    skylark is one word and doesn\u2019t need the L capitalised.\r\n\r\nTim"

    the plane shadow might be redundant and busy. 'S' needs to be tightened. 'aviation

    Color version: I actually really like this approach. Very clean and great used
    of color and space. My favorite by far.\r\n\r\nBlack/White: Clean and simple.

    from Insigne for at least three reasons:\r\n1 - as suggested at the bottom of
    the page \"Use Aviano as an alternative to Trajan\";\r\n2 - it seems to be designed

  body: "I'm with Eben on this. My eyes seem conflicted. I want to look at the word
    mark, but the bird is beautiful and pulls my eyes up away from the word mark.
    Then the shadow is clever, but ultimately is the biggest distraction because it's
    so out of focus and light, my eyes fight to focus on it more.\r\nand the \"aviation
    and training feel tacked on, running into the shadow.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the
    logo are strong, you have a great stepping stone, but it's needs refined so the
    parts work in unison. You have a lot of artistic elements, which maybe be \"over
    flavoring\" the work.\r\n\r\nAlso, I tend to agree with Tim in the refinement
    of the stylized illustration. If your image was more \"realistic\" in nature,
    I wouldn't argue, but since the image has been striped down to the bare essentials
    to infer a skylark, precision takes precedence.\r\n\r\nYou're very close, it's
    an excellent design and you should strive to make it as perfect as possible."

    however the shadow isn't convincing for me yet. Also the shadow needs to be cooled
    down it is too warm.\r\n- I really like the 1/2 color version the best. \r\n-
    The word 'Skylark' holds together in the 2 black only version, but the SK pair
    is too loose in the other two.\r\n- Maybe the shadow needs to either overlap the
    text more or not at all? "
