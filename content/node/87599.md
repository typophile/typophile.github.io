body: "Hello guys. So few friends and I are thinking of starting a monthly journal
  about jobs for university students. What we will have in it are job vacancies listings.
  We will print it in our university on an A3 paper and fold it, so it will be like
  a newspaper but for jobs for university students. We have some idea of what type
  of fonts we'd like to use, however we also would like to hear your opinions and
  suggestions as well. Our audience will be university students, age group 18-22 looking
  for a job. THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS!!!!!!!!!! \r\n\r\nAlso do you know of other similar
  magazines or newspapers that we could look at?\r\n\r\n\r\nlove,\r\nClaire and friends"

  body: wow, I like it a lot. I think we could use it for headings. Although I tried
    downloading but it doesn't work. Do you think you could help with that as well.
    Thank you very very much for your help.

    project. I offer you some font sponsoring if you happen to find something useful
