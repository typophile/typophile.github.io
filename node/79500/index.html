  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently assembling a book for publication, and I am trying to format the titles of each chapter to resemble bold headlines from the 1950s/1960s. Not being a typographer, this is all very new to me, but I do have a firm idea of what I am seeking.</p>
<p>So what I can glean from a previous conversation is that what was mostly used was a font called &ldquo;Tempo&rdquo; in Heavy and Heavy Italic&hellip;? However, this is not currently available in a digital form&ndash; only a condensed version&hellip;?</p>
<p>Additionally, I am curious as to what the typical typeface was for the bylines, photo captions and main body of text&hellip;?</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve been able to research briefly, it seems that Corona, Excelsior, News Gothic and Franklin Gothic are all possibilities for newspaper body text. Can anyone confirm this? I&rsquo;m concerned with placing this within the late 1950s-early 1960s, so authenticity is very important. It seems these typefaces were used with Linotype&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really appreciate any help/suggestions with this.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Some newspapers of that period used Bodoni Bold for their headlines - it was more common than the sans-serif typeface in your example. So that, at least, is available. And Corona was indeed the most likely form of body text. Fortunately, Bitstream has a very similar face available - News 705. News 702 is similar to Excelsior, and News 701 to Ionic No. 5, also very common for newspaper body copy, but more so at somewhat earlier dates.</div>

<p>Thank you very much for the information. I am quite partial to those sans-serif headlines&ndash; it gives them a tabloid-feel. I think that of the body text, the Excelsior is quite nice and very easy to read.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
