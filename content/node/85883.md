  the 15 minute mark in the documentary Helvetica. Whether or not this a suitable

    to release a new version (5.1) soon, but it's quite a complicated program to start
    with. Recently, some new programs more focus on designing the glyph came out.
    Have a go at Glyphs or Robofont, they are both cheaper, more modern, and so much
    more easier to get into.\r\n\r\nhttp://glyphsapp.com/\r\nhttp://doc.robofont.com/\r\n\r\nThese
    are both MAC by the way."

    is dif\uFB01cult to advise in this when there is not a clear de\uFB01nition of
    what you want to achieve. What exactly is your starting point? Are these analog
    drawings or glyphs made in for instance Adobe Illustrator? Depending on the quality
    of analog drawings, manual digitizing or scanning combined with auto-tracing are
    the two main options. Glyphs made with Adobe Illustrator can be imported and adjusted
    in all available programs for type design and font production. And then, do you
    want to batch as much as possible, do you want to script or program this yourself,
    or do you want to make use of \u2018prefab\u2019 functionality? And there are
    other matters, such as the fact that applying tools which are commonly in use
    will ensure a greater support from the type community than using applications
    developed for niche markets.\r\nPerhaps it makes sense to draw a block diagram
    in which you try to de\uFB01ne the things you want to do and the route you have
    in mind for this. Such a diagram can be used as a point of reference for further
    advise then.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Glyphs_4991.jpg]\r\nI concur
    with Richard and James that <em>Fontographer</em> and <em>Glyphs</em> are very
    suitable programs for the starting type designer. Glyphs is my personal favorite
    when it comes to the two new representatives in the font tools market (at DTL
    we will investigate the option to produce plugins for it, but \uFB01rst we will
    \uFB01nish the development of the spacing and kerning tool <em> KernMaster 2012</em>
    [for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux]). \r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Module_overview_4573.jpg]\r\nReferring
    to the recent developments and discussions on font tools, I want to add some comments
    and remarks to two aspects here, namely on the obviously increased interest in
    <em>modularity</em> and the growing support for the <em>UFO</em> format. After
    propagating modularity for more than a decade with the DTL/URW++ font tools, especially
    with <em>DTL FontMaster</em>, I am pleased to see that this structure is more
    generally accepted now than when we released FM. I recall the e-mails of potential
    customers who declared that they would buy FM if we would put all functionality
    into <strong>one</strong> program. One of my arguments for modularity was that
    the modules could be enhanced by the programmers without the potential risk of
    shuffling other functionality. I read the same argument recently in relation to
    one of the two newly released font tools. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IKV6_5113.jpg]\r\nOf
    course, FM was not the \uFB01rst modular-based application for type design and
    font production, although it made modularity more easily accessible. The <em>IKARUS</em>
    system was designed that way from the beginning on (1970s) and besides FM we are
    using the IKARUS V4 program with its <strong>huge</strong> amount of very sophisticated
    <em>command line</em> tools for the DTL font production under X11 still.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe
    support for the UFO format seems to be growing fast. Although I personally see
    no reason to trade-in the very versatile IKARUS-based \uFB01le system that the
    DTL/URW++ font tools are using, I think that it is good for the font business
    when there is a common \uFB01le format. So, all DTL/URW++ font tools will support
    the UFO format in the near future too.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB"
