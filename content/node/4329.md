    target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a> and T-26 has <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/keystone-state/"
    target="_blank">Keystone State</a>. I think they are both fairly similar to your
    sample.

  body: You can&#39;t... Lineto licensed it exclusively to one particular company,
    so it&#39;s not available to the public anymore &#40;at least not for a few years&#41;.
