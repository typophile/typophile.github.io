body: "OK, I think I have down the general idea and it's not too complex: type designers
  create type to look good at certain sizes. H&FJ have a nice graphic illustrating
  this by showing the type at different sizes and shading out areas where the type
  is not intended for use.\r\n\r\nI own Brioso Pro, my first purchase of an optical
  typeface, and the specimen book goes to some length to explain the uses of the various
  sizes.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in my most recent post, I'm terribly new to the issues
  of real type and typesetting, and I'm only self-taught, so please forgive me for
  asking what is likely an astonishingly basic question:\r\n\r\nI see typefaces where
  there is a number after the number of the name, eg, Didot 16, Cycles 24. I am embarrassed
  to admit that I have wondered for you years what the numbers represented. I can't
  believe that \"font size\" never occurred to me! Je m'accuse! However, after I realized
  what it meant, I read somewhere (this site? a book?) that just because that number
  represented a size didn't mean that one was bound to that size, so I could have
  Didot 16 at, say, 11/13 (eleven point type with 13 point leading\u2014in case I
  used the wrong convention).\r\n\r\nSo, that's what I don't understand. If Didot
  16 is designed for 16pt type, then why set it at anything else? Or, is this a case
  of the perfect being an enemy of the good? We vary the optical to make sizes we
  don't have because the designer can't simply design every single point size imaginable?\r\n\r\nI'm
  not even sure how to search for this or what terms to use. If there is a simple
  explanation, or if someone could point me to a resource or to, I'd be most grateful!\r\n\r\nMy
  thanks,\r\n\r\nKeith"

  body: "My interpretation of what you wrote is that you are looking at screen fonts,
    not optically-designed outline fonts. Screen fonts usually have a size indicator
    to represent what size they appear best at on a monitor. The associated outline
    font is not usually size-specific.\r\n\r\nIf you were to print out a line of type
    with that font selected and the outline part was missing, you would get type that
    would be very bitmapped. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "George, you are correct about screen or pixel fonts, but I don't think Keith
    was talking about them, as HTF Didot and Cycles are made for print, not the screen.
    \r\n\r\nKeith, you're right; type with optical sizes are sometimes made for particular
    point sizes. But they are suggestions; your hard drive won't explode if you set
    Didot 16 at 24 pts! And, as you said, while some of it is that no sane type designer
    would design for every possible size -- especially since now it is easier than
    ever to set type at something like 11.128 pts -- a big part of it is that optical
    sizes exist to give the designer flexibility and refinement but not to prescribe
    rules.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many typefaces with optical sizes eschew specific point
    sizes altogether, e.g. Robert Slimbach's <a href=http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?event=displayStoreSelector&keyword=fonts>Arno
    Pro</a> (Display, Subhead, Text, Small Text, Caption) and the many typefaces like
    <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham>Farnham</a> that have display and
    text cuts. While a number may indicate exact measure (and perhaps the type designer
    did most of the testing at that size), any typeface can be set at any size. But
    certain attributes may make a particular font more useful in certain size ranges
    than in others. \r\n\r\nHTF Didot is a great example. If you were to use the 96
    pt version at 9 pt, the fine hairlines would disappear (among other things), making
    it less readable. But there's no reason you couldn't use the 64 pt version at
    92 pts for a bolder, stronger look, just as you could certainly use the 16 pt
    version at 11 pts if you were printing at an extremely high resolution or with
    little distortion from the ink. The best bet is to try them all out (and print
    them out, not just view them on the screen!) and choose the cut that fits the
    look and feel you want.\r\n\r\nChristian Schwartz emphasizes this point nicely
    when discussing his <a href=http://christianschwartz.com/giorgio.shtml>Giorgio</a>:
    \"Because the contrast between thick and thin is so extreme, this family is offered
    in 4 versions for different sizes. For normal use with offset printing, we recommend
    using Small from 24 point up to about 45 point, Medium up to about 70 point, Large
    up to about 90 point, and XLarge for anything above 90 point, where its delicate
    serifs and hairlines look their best; however, for screenprinting, reversing out
    of a colored background, or on-screen use (to name just a few exceptions), these
    guidelines may not necessarily apply.\""
