    angry with me, but was it a doctor, who has diagnosed it? Somehow it sounds more
    like normal street English (which naturally has its own aesthetical charm). However,
    I agree, that one must have seen a few of the dark sides of life for not being
    superficial. I think I have a slight Synesthesia, because sometimes I get a visual
    flash of patterns, if I am startled. But maybe it is something else."

  body: "Consider using Fontstruct.com. That way you're all gridded up & there's not
    much of a software learning curve compared to most font design apps. Go check
    it out. Don't bother gridding it out in Photoshop because there's no way to get
    it into font software without f&#117;cking it all up. It's possible but it's more
    work that you might think.\r\n\r\nYour first response was the funniest and perhaps
    coolest Typophile post I've read in 2010."

    the fact that semi-universal literacy is a fairly recent phenomenon, \"never\"
    is a pretty strong assertion: how can you tell if an illiterate person has dyslexia
    or not?"

    these days is ridiculous. Logically, how could that many people have ADD?"
