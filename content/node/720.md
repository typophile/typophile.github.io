body: Hi all, <BR>this forum is read by people all over the world. This gives us the
  opportunity of being able to combine our knowlegde. For example our knowlegde about
  language. <BR> <BR>I am speaking here about kerning. Everyone who has touched or
  dived into the world of kerning knows this is a very difficult theme. <BR> <BR>I
  would like to use this thread to put up a list of all usable character and sign
  combinations which are being used all over the world and should be incorporated
  into the kerning of fonts. &#40;of course, only if the design needs it&#41; <BR>
  <BR>Theorectically there are more than 600,000 possible combinations, which can
  be made with a standard font &#40;latin 1 font encoding&#41;. Wouldn&#39;t it be
  nice to know what pairs don&#39;t make any sense? <BR> <BR>Such a list would be
  a big help for every font designer. <BR> <BR>----Jacques

  body: Jacques -- <BR> <BR>At one point during the development of Whitman, I spent
    several hours with various dictionaries -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
    Swedish, Danish, and Dutch -- to identify accent combinations in either the first
    or second positions. I was looking for possible cap/lc kerns. Not being at all
    fluent in most of these languages, I&#39;m not sure which words might have been
    completely unlikely to show up as the first word in a sentence, but I got into
    an obsessive mode. <BR> <BR>I was also interested in finding which accented characters
    apeared in initial or terminal positions, in which languages, to consider whether
    they required kerning with various quotation marks. <BR> <BR>It was an interesting
    exercise. I can try to find my list somewhere for you, when I get a chance. <BR>
    <BR>I believe John Hudson has developed some extensive kerning lists along these
    lines. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    notice a couple of probable typos. There&#39;s a &#34;t.&#34; on the same line
    in Lower/Lower as &#34;qu&#34;, suggesting that it wanted to be &#34;q.&#34; instead
    &#40;borne out by the fact that there&#39;s another &#34;t.&#34; a couple of lines
    down&#41;, and for some reason in Cap/Cap, the letter &#34;M&#34; has become a
    kerning pair all by itself. &#34;MC&#34;, maybe?

  body: Kerning in Adobe OpenType Pro fonts contains many pairs which couldn&#39;t
    appear in a real written text. There is a limited amount of Czech accented letters,
    like ccaron, scaron or uring. These characters are used in Czech word only and
    cannot be combined with French / Italian etc. letters. So the combinations like
    Tcaron&#43;acircumflex or Lslash&#43;Yacute are absurd. I think it would be great
    to create linguistic-based kerining pairs. There could be several lists of pairs
    - for Western, Eastern European, Cyrillic and other encodings. &#40;May be the
    problem is, that Adobe OpenType Pro fonts simply kerns letters T&#43;a with all
    possible accents.&#41;

  body: <i>&#62;&#40;May be the problem is, that Adobe OpenType Pro fonts simply kerns
    letters T&#43;a with all possible accents.&#41;</i> <BR> <BR>I believe that this
    is exactly why you find the kind of absurd combinations you cite. But, while this
    would be a disadvantage in a typical Type 1 font &#40;because bloated kerning
    tables slow down processing&#41;, since Adobe OT fonts take full advantage of
    class-based kerning, these combinations take virtually no extra code &#40;depending,
    of course, on how the classes are defined&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, in the case of OT
    fonts, I think more might be better -- i.e., better to be thorough and have a
    few absurd combinations, than not to have accented pairs. Also, since it takes
    no real overhead, casting a wide net is probably a lot more efficient than trying
    to analyze every conceivable language and identify only the &#40;currently&#41;
    possible combinations.  <BR> <BR>In OT, that is -- with class-based kerning. Not
    in Type 1.  Jacques&#39;s list will be useful for Type 1 kerning. <BR>  <BR>--

  body: Just to expand on Kent&#39;s comment, removing those &#34;nonsense&#34; pairs
    would in fact make the font larger, when using class kerning! <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    explain how it works with only a little simplification. There is a matrix of left
    vs. right classes. Any exceptions are additional line items that must precede
    that matrix. If an exception is necessary to avoid a collision or because the
    kerning result was poor, then we&#39;ll try to do that. But suppressing &#34;nonsense&#34;
    combinations would simply add more exceptions, and bloat the font, without making
    it any better--it&#39;s not like they hurt anything. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Kent and Phinney, <BR>you&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t know about OTFs actually.
    I haven&#39;t been very deep into that chapter yet. Indeed, my original question
    is to be seen within the realm of type 1. <BR> <BR>Please correct me if I&#39;m
    wrong, but if one works with classes, like phinney explained, isn&#39;t there
    a chance of becoming colliding glyphs or exaggerated kerning? If so, you still
    need a list &#40;of all pairs that make sense&#41; to be used for controlling.  <BR>

    have fonts, which includes all languages included in a western type 1 font. Otherwise
    you&#39;ll end up with maybe 5 or even 10 different fonts. This is doomed to go
    wrong. Imagine your font is being used by a multinational, operating in the US

    like phinney explained, isn&#39;t there a chance of becoming colliding glyphs
    or exaggerated kerning?</i> <BR> <BR>I have not delved into class kerning yet,
    so I speak only form a theoeretical understanding, not practical experience. But
    the theory is that if you have equivalent sidebearings in your base letter and
    the rest of the members in the class, then what&#39;s good for the base is good
    for the rest. There are, of course, cases where this breaks down -- for instance
    the kern for Va may not work for V{agrave} &#40;depending upon the design of your
    grave&#41;. That&#39;s when you&#39;d create an exception, I suppose. The other
    option might be to define a second class of a-like glyphs which doesn&#39;t include
    some accented a&#39;s specifically for kerning with overhanging capitals -- that
    sort of thing. But, of course, too much of this -- either exceptions or extra
    classes -- starts to enlarge the font and also the work, almost defeating the
    purpose of using classes. <BR> <BR>Class kerning is a powerful tool, but it requires
    planning and careful logic in setting up your classes, as well as designing your
    glyphs. It seems like it would work better with consistent, regular designs than
    with idiosyncratic, irregular designs. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>
