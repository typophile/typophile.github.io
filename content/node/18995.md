  is from finnish traffic signage.\r\n\r\nI have to do a spoof based on the signage,
  I don't\r\nneed a 100% match but something that would look similiar\r\nto most people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  I just should flip trough the junk at dafont to find\r\nsomething equally as ugly.
  Any suggestions?"

    I have been there searching, too bad I couldn't find\r\nenough letters to work
    with.\r\n\r\nDwiggins' <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?41H\">CG Gothic
    no 1</a> would perhaps work, but it's a bit too narrow."

  body: i could hook you up with the typefaces used on Swedish road signs, but it's
    not the same font (the lower case in particular looks rather different). perhaps
    it could do if you did something with just caps, but not if you wanted it to look
    just like your sample.

  body: "Hello all,\r\nI know it is a pretty late reply (1,5 years!) :) but I got
    quite interested in the subject matter after reading your posts and made a small
    investigation. (and hopefully someone will read this anyway)\r\n\r\nAt the Finnish
    Road Administration office they told me it is some sort of custom design similar
    to Helvetica Bold (sic!) created in the sixties and they admitted that engineers,
    not typographers, designed the letter forms. \r\n\r\nI heard that probably at
    some point the Finnish Road Administration will have to consider updating to a
    new typeface since, apart from not being too handsome, the letters don't function
    well on the reflective material used nowadays in traffic signs. \r\nA good article
    about a similar situation in the US was published in the [[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/magazine/12fonts-t.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=magazine&adxnnlx=1190189763-Mmz37gsx1bmBxABDDfsI6w|NY
    Times]].\r\n\r\nI was told that the letters don't exist in a standard font format
    but the shapes are available in AutoCAD files (which I will receive soon by email).\r\nIf
    I understood correctly every time a sign with altogether new content has to be
    created it has to be set manually letter by letter since no kerning values exist
    for the current font.\r\n\r\nJan, if you would like me to send you the files once
    I receive them leave me a comment on my [[http://typotrip.wordpress.com|TypoTrip]]
    blog (I don't want to publish my email here because of spam).\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nWojtek\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE
    13:16\r\nI have now received the shapes. If anyone's interested contact me as
    mentioned above.\r\n\r\n"
