  in the forums appreciating the high quality of the threads for a looong time. I
  designed this logo for a new travel agency, the client has already accepted the
  draft but I know there is still room for improvements. Many thanks for any feedback
  and please, be critic! '

    you're working with.\r\n\r\nRemember that the logo will need to be reproduced
    in all sorts of low quality ways and cramped-for-space places. Scale the logo
    down, does it still work?\r\n\r\n--\r\n<em>penn</em>"

    the level of detail.\r\n\r\nAlso, you're possibly getting a bit close to <a href=\"http://bizbox.slate.com/blog/ObamaLogo.jpg\">this</a>
    in structure."

    contrast. Thanks for the feedback.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LOGO-BW_5840.jpg]"

  body: The halftone pattern adds too much detail and mannerism. Try to enlarge the
    camel and rider and complete the circle with a swoosh-like shape or two in the
    style of the sand dunes.

  body: "I think what penn and nina were referring to was the camel. \r\n\r\nThere's
    simply too much detail. That whip/swtich the rider's holding needs to go, clean
    up the line of the animal's stomach where the rider's foot or perhaps the saddle
    pokes out--get rid of it.\r\n\r\nI also saw Obama's logo. \r\n\r\nOverall it's
    fairly nice."

    late reply, I am travelling to Italy in these days...\r\n\r\nCamel trouble: Cranked
    down the detail, looks way better.\r\nObama resembling: Sadly is too late, the
    client already accepted it..and the circle was meant to convey the cyclical life
    of migrations of Tuareg people and of course, sun and Sahara. I attach a couple
    of alternative proposals, just to show slightly different approaches..\r\n@ boros
    and penn.and.ink. I swear, no more halftones for this logo. But the seventies
    has this weird grip on me.. ;)\r\n\r\nStill working on it, soon I will post the
    final result.\r\n\r\nAttachment:\r\nLogo 1 is the same concept of this one, logo
    3 was sort of calligraphic /geometric attempt...\r\n\r\nMany many thanks again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_alt_5223.gif]"

  body: I didn't really get the whole "Obama" feel from this one as much. The only
    things it has in common is that it's a circle and there are waves in it. Which
    is pretty normal. I definitely think the logo chosen is the strongest one, by
    far. Well done.

  body: I think you can safely go with just the camel, i.e. drop the actual touareg.
    This should allow for further simplification of the logo.

  body: I think the image is very evocative, but perhaps too Arab-centric, unless
    the agency specializes in that part of the world.

    I can just tweak the logo now, because the client already accepted it. The client
    specified that she wanted tuareg and sun in the logo...\r\n\r\nAttached the result
    achieved with the help of your suggestions  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to all!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Touareg_logo_6680.jpg]"

  body: "Getting there . . .\r\n\r\nThere is something about the orange one that bugs
    me \u2014 I think it's the way the stroke on the top of the hill in the foreground
    is orange as it passes through the sun. It works where it separates the dunes,
    but not in front of the sun. \r\n\r\nYour greyscale version looks better because
    the stroke fades to white, but it's still jarring as it fades back to grey on
    the right side. I say, remove the stroke from in front of the sun. "

    t0 convey movement, like a light breeze moving red sand ( hop I am not getting
    too cheesy)\r\n@ Lex Kominek: Thank for the suggestion, I will try. Afterwards
    I will do signage and business card, I will post the results when they will be
    ready."

  body: In all these examples the camel is inside a circle. I want to see you try
    it out of the circle or without the circle. Or try the circle in black and make
    the camel white as a knockout.
