  to determine the typeface in 'christian Dior' (see attached image).\r\n\r\nAnd I
  couldn't find it. I searched in my typefinder, and online but nowhere I could find
  it.\r\n\r\nI've got the impression that it might be a recent design or custom made;
  But it is a beautiful face; notice the strange 'a'.\r\n\r\nI found something that
  came nearby like 'cochin'&'sabon'. \r\n\r\nHas anybody an idea who designed this
  font, or where to find it for purchase.\r\n\r\nthanks!!!\r\n\r\n;-)  Zo\xEB"

    that Dior would be rather upset if you <em>could</em> buy it. However, <em>contra</em>
    the custom theory, it strikes me as somewhat odd that the spacing between the
    i and o in Dior seems a little dodgy.\r\n\r\nAlso, wdq154226: why are you gracing
    these discussions with links to Chinese manufacturers? Much as I love fiberglass,
    I don't see that it contributes much..."

  body: The Christian Dior logo appears to be based on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.100674.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=ChristianDior&sampleSize=48">Nicholas
    Cochin</a>. It's more refined, but otherwise very similar.
