  like the elongated hedera in Adobe Minion (below), but it's a bit too round for
  what I need. Think Didot-ugly proportions/contrast. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AdobeMinion_hedera_6271.gif]"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions; I found a couple of interesting versions amongst
    the type+ebellishments, and the Caravan hedera is interesting (although it looks
    a bit like an apple with a big bite taken out of it). I may end up having to draw
    one to get the feel of the type I'll be using for the book, but having a handful
    to examine will aid in the process. If anyone can think of other candidates, please
    keep'em coming...

    Vine Leaves</a> has some attractive narrow hedera, bit calligraphic in some cases,
    I'm not sure they fall into your criteria.\r\nTim"

    to examine, and Vine Leaves certainly has just that. Again, thanks.'
