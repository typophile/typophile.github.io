  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Help!  I hate the childish, inconsistent, heavy-handed scrawl that passes for my handwriting.  However, I'm not much happier with the readily available learn-at-home alternatives: italic or modern cursive.  They are legible, but that's about it.  They reek practicality, without having elegance or sophistication or individuality.

I am looking for a font to use as a model for my handwriting. My ideal would be something modern, distinctive, legible, fairly easy to write quickly and arresting or "cool" (whatever that means when applied to handwriting).  A lot to ask, I know.

I would so appreciate any suggestions.  Thank you in advance for your help.

		<div class="commentbody">If you emulate a font with your handwriting, it will look like faux type. Which can look cool, but would also be decidedly mannered, even affected. Most people will think it's phony. So I don't think you should fake your handwriting. The most you should want to change it might be to make it more legible. And there's one very easy way to do that: slow down.

		<div class="commentbody">It seems you want a distinctive, but very legible handwriting, yet not affected-looking. 

This may or may not help you: 

Many people have noticed my handwriting is distinctive. I'm asked to address special envelopes and such. 

My handwriting started to become distinctive after I took art school classes in Lettering 101. We first learned a basic upright style using a broad-nibbed pen. 

I stopped writing in the slanted, cursive style I was taught in 3rd grade (Palmer?). To me, that seems to result in sloppiness, with the letters all too often running together and resembling each other (m-n-w-i-e). 

I started writing habitually in an upright, unconnected style, with each letter formed separately, with a 2-story "a," and large capitals. When written hurriedly, the letterforms are more dramatic. 

It resembles [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/genial/|Genial]]

or  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/coral/|Coral]]

		<div class="commentbody">I keep altering mine, albeit only slightly each time, just because I want it to look better. For years I avoided using my actual handwriting because I felt it hadn't developed since school. I do a quite a lot of different lettering styles but these are all fairly slow and calculated, but I thought I could in some way work backwards from those to create a faster, instinctive handwriting, and around that time I happened to find the Rosemary Sassoon book.

I retrain my handwriting partly when things start to go wrong with it, such as r & v looking too similar, and bad spacing on cl so it looks like d, and while I'm doing that I might change the way I write some other letters. I also write differently depending on the pen I'm using. I do the traditional italic slant with fine pointed nibs but do an upright version with wider nibs, or even slant to the left with something very wide like a Pilot Parallel pen.

True, however, there's nothing wrong with mimicking or copying; if your aim is to learn how they do it. Later on, when you're competent -- apply what you learned to your own handwriting, design etc etc

Yes, it does.

I fully acknowledge that there are people whose handwriting is in some real and obvious sense a reflection of them -- and if it isn't obvious, it isn't much of a reflection! But I reject the notion that this is true of all people and all handwriting. It depends very much on what one's individual relationship is to one's writing, and how one approaches it.</div>

What appears when I write quickly is the result of my poor pen grip and my subsequent tendency to write with my fingers instead of my arm. This has nowt to do with my ‘deeper self’ and everything to do with poor schooling. By schooling I do not mean, by the way, teaching of a particular style of writing, but instruction and practice in effective manipulation of the tool.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Couldn't handwriting be compared to your speaking voice? That's a "reflection of you" without question, yet it if you learned bad habits growing up, your speaking voice  doesn't do you justice. 

For instance, if you talk so fast, so sloppily, and with such a thick regional accent, that many people have trouble understanding; you don't make a good impression at a job interview; not suited to jobs dealing with the public, etc. 

This could be dramatically improved by slowing down, paying attention, and practicing. You might use a good speaker as a role model, but it's still your own voice; you don't have to be an impersonator.

As to the comparison of voice and writing, I can speak to that a bit as I am an actor and have done a good bit of work on my vocal presentation.  A practised voice is not necessarily a mannered or self-conscious voice.  In many ways, it brings you closer to your true self, not farther away.  Parts of yourself emerge that would otherwise go unexpressed or remain concealed.</div>

Sorry, that was a pun to Hrant.

I've found that practice does help, but I've also noticed from my own hadwriting, that after primary and secondary school instruction, when I found my own handwriting, it had surpricingly little to do with what I've been taught: I started writing individual glyphs instead of connecing ones, and it was upright instead of slanted, as I was taught it should.</div>

You experience is exactly what I wrote above: changing to upright unconnecting glyphs allowed me find my own style. I always disliked slanting my writing; was taught you need to tilt the paper sideways to accomplish this. WTF? And it's harder to read, anyway.

By the way, when I saw your new gazillion-glyph release Suomi Script on MyFonts, my jaw dropped. Oh, that is luscious. I can't afford it at the moment, but maybe someday.   </div>
