  is the art of decorating a manuscript with line drawings, colour and gilding. The
  art of illumination was revived in Victorian times through the encouragement of
  people such as Henry Shaw, who copied manuscripts held in the British Museum with
  the cooperation and support of Sir Frederic Madden, the Museum's Keeper of Manuscripts;
  [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Johnston]]. \r\n\r\nIlluminated manuscripts of medieval
  times were almost always religious books. The texts were written in [[Uncial]],
  [[Carolingian Minuscule]] and [[Humanistic]] scripts. The pages were vellum (finely
  scraped and stretched calf- or goatskin) and often beautifully bound with gold and
  gems set into the covers. The decorations helped the users of the books navigate
  through the pages in the absence of page numbers or running titles. Large illustrations
  (such as the Gospel pages in [[Book of Kells]] and the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]])
  could be held up to show to an illiterate audience. Illumination also served glorify
  the word of God; possibly illumination may have \"protected\" the books from evil,
  with crosses and symbols serving as talismans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>References</h2>\r\n<ul><li>de
