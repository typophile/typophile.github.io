    is set in Arrighi (and Centaur), and you can't get much more historicallly interesting
    either. (Ok. that's my opinion.)\r\n\r\nFYI: <em>This Is a Printing Office,</em>
    by Beatrice Warde, 1932. Broadside."

    Roman. Darn you Morrison!

    body: "Dear Miss Tiffany,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for sending this sample along.
      I appreciate your help. Now, concerning your comment: \"Darn you Morison!\"
      do I take it that you hold a grudge against this esteemed man of letters? If
      so, you may be interested in my parody of Stanley Morison: \"Stanley Morison's
      Egg-Sandwich Exegesis\" which I published in April in a limited edition of 100
      copies. I expected only a handful of people on the planet might be interested
      in this (respectful) parody of the Master's prose style, and given your interests,
      you may one of the select few for whom this piece was written. Please see http://infernopress.blogspot.com
      for details. I still have a few copies left.\r\n\r\nIn any event, thanks for
      your help.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n"
