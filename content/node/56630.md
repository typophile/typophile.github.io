    pretty close to Gotham.  Just give the P and R larger eyes, drop the middle of
    the M closer to the baseline, and sharpen the Q."

  body: "The 'larger eyes' are also a feature of [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/collections/neutraface|House
    Neutraface]]. There are alternates for many of the letters, and Neutraface No.2
    has more conventional forms, if you need them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
