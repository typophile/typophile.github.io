    be used on German License Plates and be difficult to forge/modify. More information

  body: Thought it could have been a custom based on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/garage-gothic/|Garage
    Gothic]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/driver-gothic/|Driver Gothic]]
    but looks like [[http://www.ffonts.net/Cargo-Two-SF.font|Cargo Two]] / [[http://www.dafont.com/kraftfahrzeugkennzeichen.font|Kraftfahrzeugkennzeichen]]
    (the closest considering the /A's top) / [[http://www.ffonts.net/GL-Nummernschild-Eng.font|GL-Nummernschild-Eng]]
    are pretty close. There's also [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fountain/sauerkrauto_pro/|Sauerkrauto]],
    possibly the only version that could be considered as legal.
