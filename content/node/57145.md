  and the use of white space. Any other comments most welcome. I want it to work as
  either a baby shower or a bridal shower invite.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AsianShower_6108.jpg]"

    the texture you see underneath it is Parchtone by French paper (but if I were
    not using that then I would do your idea)."

    I mean it is a shower after all. Maybe some of the drops could hit the waves making
    splashes?\r\n\r\nP.S. type bukkake into google and I'm sure you'll get more than
    enough information :]"

  body: "@Bloodtype: HAHAHAHA, terrible. My college friend's roommate used \"bukkake\"
    as their network name to trump other offensive names for networks in the area.
    \r\n\r\nI think the typeface either needs to be larger, or have more contrast,
    because it is EXTREMELY hard to read. Also...the color I think is a little too
    yellow-toned, honestly...it's sort of a poo brown. I really like the overall design,
    I would probably also play with the spacing of the lines."

  body: Also, perhaps instead of Caslon, if you wanted a serif typeface, High Tower
    Text is pretty nice (included if you have windows xp or up), it's a little more
    soft...this typeface almost seems too...edgy?

    something simple, but both Trade Gothic and Caslon don't quite work.\r\n\r\nThe
    color is not exactly right on screen: it will be a metallic bronze-gold on a yellow
    parchment color... knowing that do you still think it would be too yellow/ poo
    brown?\r\n\r\nPlay with the spacing of the lines vertically?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Well, you could also use the fonts for the japanese characters, so it looks
    distinctly like the typefaces used by japanese-only computers etc. (not the actual
    kanji, but the typefaces have regular letters)\r\n\r\nand yes, I meant vertically.
    The distance between the last two lines looks uneven, as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I
    think even if it will be a bronze/brown color, I would print it on more of an
    ivory color so it wouldn't clash as much, that would probably also help with the
    contrast."

  body: "Hi angechilada,\r\n\r\nI see what you mean about the contrast, my only concern
    is that while ivory and gold DO say wedding shower they don't say baby shower
    and I was hoping that by using a yellow color I could use this for both. Though
    I admit I did originally want a much lighter shade of yellow...but French paper
    doesn't make one.\r\n\r\ni will check on the lines."

  body: I really like this, but I think you could make the droplets less stiff. They
    stand out a bit too much from the fluid motion of the waves and the symbol at
    the top. And actually, I like the typeface.

  body: "The kanji is correct. Read as \"nami\" in Japanese \u6CE2\u3002\r\n\r\nThe
    character \u6D6A can also mean \"wave\" but usually has the sense of \"billows\"
    or \"wandering\" Eg \u6D6A\u4EBA \"ronin\" a wandering man = samurai with no master.
    Use in Chinese may be different.\r\n\r\nYour character is more common one for
    \"wave\" in Japanese\r\n\r\nYou might like \u6D74 \"to bathe, bask in sun, to
    shower\"\r\n"

  body: "You guys are great! Thanks. I did want it to be a Japanese character...the
    reason being that I wanted it to be an asian piece and not specific to one country
    so I used a chinese style illustration for the waves and then wrote wave in Japanese.
    Do you think that is a bad idea? Should I make the whole thing Chinese?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "\u6CE2 is also wave in Chinese. I think \u6D6A is a more white-water, surfer
    type wave and \u6CE2 is more of a rippling undulating wave.\r\n\r\n(\u6CE2\u52D5\u62F3
    is also the surge-fist or \"hadouken\" from SF ... )\r\n\r\nI think the thing
    that sticks out for me is that the style of the waves and the character don't
    match. The waves are very crisp, whereas the character looks brush-drawn. Would
    it be possible to roughen the edges so the waves also look like they're drawn
    with a brush? Also maybe the wave design should reach to the edge of the paper
    on both sides to make more of a solid block."

  body: Or alternatively do the character and droplets with sharp edges. Maybe even
    round and cutesy as it's a baby shower. Were you thinking Hello Kitty or Hokusai?

    it (hello kitty v.s. Hokusai). I changed the style of the drops and calligraphy
    to go with the waves since I liked those best...I also then changed the typeface
    to Gotham rounded to keep with the feel of it.\r\n\r\nOkay all...I sent it to
    the printer..thanks for all of your helpful comments!!!"

  body: Sorry, not sure if you are still working on this. I meant the drops were drawn
    too stiff. They could look more fluid like the waves at the bottom.
