body: 'A few days ago, in the midst of another thread, Hrant posed a &#39;pop quiz&#39;
  question &#40;what was Beatrice Warde&#39;s mother&#39;s maiden name?&#41;. This
  gave me an idea for a new thread, one that might perhaps run for a while. This is
  a pop quiz thread. Here are the rules: <BR> <BR>1. The winner of a quiz poses the
  next question. <BR> <BR>2. The winner of a quiz is the first person to answer the
  current question correctly. <BR> <BR>3. The person who poses the question should
  declare the winner according to these rules within 1 hour &#40;exceptions will be
  made in the event that the person who posed the question is asleep&#41;. <BR> <BR>4.
  After the winner has been declared, there will be a 1 hour grace period during which
  time the answer may be challenged by anyone who believes that both the person who
  posed the question and the person who answered it are wrong; the winner may not
  pose a new question during this hour, or until any resulting challenge has been
  resolved. <BR> <BR>5. If the challenger can offer convincing evidence that he or
  she is correct, the challenger is declared the winner and may pose the next question;
  the person who posed the question and declared the incorrect answer correct is barred
  from winning any of the next three questions regardless of whether he or she correctly
  answers them. <BR> <BR>6. If the challenger is proven to be incorrect, the original
  declaration stands and the winner poses the next question; in this event the disgraced
  challenger is barred from winning any of the next three questions regardless of
  whether he or she correctly answers them. <BR> <BR>7. Other rules may be invented
  by the quizmaster &#40;that&#39;s me&#41; as the need arises. <BR> <BR>8. In the
  event of inconclusive disputes &#40;e.g. if a challenger proves the original winner
  to be incorrect but is also found to be incorrect&#41;, the quizmaster &#40;that&#39;s
  me again&#41; reserves the right to declare the quiz null and to pose a new question
  or invite a previous winner to pose a new question. <BR> <BR>9. In order to reduce
  the likelihood that the same group of individuals will keep winning, due to their
  shared obsessions with particular typographic esoterica, no new question may be
  of a similar theme to the immediately previous question &#40;e.g. if one question
  is about an obscure operating detail of Monotype keyboarding, the next question
  must be of a non-technical nature&#41;. <BR> <BR>10. People who don&#39;t like the
  quizmaster&#39;s rules &#40;that&#39;s my rules&#41; should start their own pop
  quiz threads; this is called the Democracy of Bandwidth. <BR> <BR>11. If Gerald
  Lange objects that this is subverting a serious typographic discussion forum for
  &#39;entertainment&#39;, he should consider that the quality of questions is in
  the hands of the people who pose and answer them, and that if all goes well we might
  learn some interesting facts &#40;in any case, it&#39;s got to be better than the
  very silly &#39;six degrees&#39; threads&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>As this was my idea, and because I successfully
  answered Hrant&#39;s pop quiz re. Mrs Lamberton &#40;okay, so I checked my answer
  with Shelley Gruendler before I posted it&#41;, I will pose the first question.
  This one is about an obscure operating detail of Monotype keyboarding: <BR> <BR>
  <BR>HOW FAR DID THE PAPER RIBBON ADVANCE EACH TIME A KEY WAS PRESSED AND DEPRESSED  ON
  THE BANCROFT DESIGN &#40;POST-1899&#41; MONOTYPE KEYBOARD?'

    this is an even better question than I thought. I will say that it is an absolute
    amount, not relative to type size, so Sean&#39;s guess is very wide of the mark.

  body: Tiffany, my suspicion is that the ribbon actually carried encoded data of
    the text stream, not images of the type. This ribbon was fed into another machine
    that set a given font using the data. Right? So there was some fixed metric &#40;or
    Imperial - more fitting these days...&#41; amount the ribbon moved for each character,
    and I suspect that happened upon the <i>release</i> of the key &#40;the pressing
    only serving to punch the ribbon, not move it&#41;. <BR> <BR>BJ, John isn&#39;t

    of punched holes at regular intervals. I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s also correct
    that the ribbon advanced when the key was depressed, but I&#39;m not 100% sure
    which is why I worded the question to avoid that issue. <BR> <BR>BJ, I do encourage

    answer and have everyone think &#39;Wow! Who knew BJ was so knowledgeable about

    of Devanagari</i> &#40;Bombay, 1965&#41;. I believe the 1/8 inch advance was standard
    to all Monotype machines, but phrased the question the way I did because I&#39;m
    not sure that it was so on the very earliest machines. The machines that Bancroft
    designed in 1899 became the model for all subsequent machines. <BR> <BR>Unless
