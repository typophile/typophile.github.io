  body: Good books mentioned above. Grid Systems shows examples of a 32 unit grid,
    and makes the point of showing how versatile it is. I'd suggest building symbolic
    value into the grid design. I believe the tree of life, with its sepheroth and
    paths yields a 32 sum. Look at a GO board as well (Chinese/Japanese Board game).
    It has a node for each day of the year. You may be able to design something that
    both functions well and also holds more esoteric information.
