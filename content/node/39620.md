  for, but I'll try to describe it as best I can.\r\n\r\nIt's a caps only, tall, narrow,
  somewhat ornate sans serif font with nicks and notches in it like Papyrus.  It vaguely
  resembles Galahad, but more condensed.\r\n\r\nThis font is used for the hardcover
  dustjackets of the tenth anniversary re-release of the \"His Dark Materials\" books
  (i.e., \"The Golden Compass,\" etc.), paired with P22's Cezanne.\r\n\r\nI remember
  this font was also used for some of Panera Bread's marketing a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\nI'll
  try to get an image of this as soon as I can, but if anyone knows this font in the
  meantime, I'd be ever so grateful!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn the Fontaholic"

    you so much -- this was driving me mad, and now I see why, because there are no
    keywords associated with it on, ahem, that particular site you mentioned...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn
