body: "Hi, I want to purchase a font from myfonts.com for a client. I think that they
  generally sell licenses that allow a font to be used on 5 computers.\r\n\r\nMy client
  should be able to use the font on a limited number of machines as well as I on one
  machine. Can I buy  a license over my myfonts.com account, so that the client can
  use it on 4 machines and I can use it on mine, or do I have to buy 2 licenses, which
  seems  a bit of a waste of money to me.\r\n\r\nIf I didn't use the font, could I
  still buy a license for my client? Or should they buy it themselves?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks for answers."

    you are one user (locations) and your client another.\r\n\r\nYou can buy a license
    for your client, but for the sake of keeping an ordered paper trail, I would suggest
    your client licenses it themselves.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "i know some eulas dont allow this, but - given its allowed by the eula -
    you could buy one license, design the whole stuff, delete the fontfiles from your
    computer (including backups) and then the client could install the font - right?\r\n\r\nof
    course problems will come up if you have to design something for them again, and
    they have to delete all the fonts on their computer, give you the license, you
    do it, and the whole thing starts again\u2026 but i work for many startups and
    getting them to pay for ANY font is hard - this could help (\"lets just take arial\",
    erm)."

  body: Transferring is allowed by some EULAs. So, technically, yes, you could do
    the work and when you are finished transfer the rights of use to your client.
    Because I'm paranoid I would always call the foundry before licensing and let
    them know what I'm planning to do. Let them answer that it is ok. Cover all bets
    so to speak. Then when you are going to transfer the fonts, get back in touch
    with the foundry again and ask them how they require you to do it.
