Hi all,

I have seriously considered designing a sans typeface. I’m looking to see if anyone knows some great texts or other resources for designing said type. I was looking at both Gotham and Avenir as inspiration, but wanted to make a face that was unique as well. Aside from two typefaces i designed while I was a student, i don’t feel as if i actually know many rules of thumb that create a good typeface.

I had a tendency to try and force all my letters (aside from lc m,i) into a monospaced width, and tried to force everything into a neat little system. It came out looking something like the bastard child of DIN Engschrift and Franklin Gothic, with Modula as the surrogate mother. The more I looked up close at Gotham, Avenir, and others like them, the more I wanted to try and make a serious typeface of professional quality. I know it takes years for that, but i may as well start while I’m young.

Some points I’m thinking of (in order of importance):
Proportions and ratios of individual letters compared to others
Italics (obliques)
non-alphanumeric characters
Achieving 3-4 weights (maybe this comes after I get a single weight down)
Condensed
Smallcaps

Also, what typog program would be recommended? This Adobe whore doesn't know what the standard/favorite is.

Any resources or books would be much obliged.

Best,

Andy</div>

I guess the answer would be for my own self gratification, but also to further my skill set. I'm only two years out of school (BFA GD), but I find myself increasingly interested of the type side of design. I think I would enjoy designing a typeface. I guess there may be a concern as to why we need another sans, with all the choices that are already there. So I would say that i "have" to design a serif because a) I find their forms very simple and elegant, and b) I feel like serifs or contrasting widths would be a little overwhelming to start with. I know that whatever I create most likely won't be anything that Robert Bringhurst will ever write about, but I'm looking to start out.</div>
