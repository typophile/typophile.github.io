    <BR>- - - <BR>..graphic designer Paul Rand, the new logotype replaced the former

    Rodolfo is right, it is from May 1985.

  body: Thanks about the info, Rodolfo and Mello. :-&#41; I thought it could be something
    comics-related because Mello used to join a comic-makers group at FAU. Anyway,
    this guy recorded &#34;Girl from Ipanema&#34; in &#39;56? Have you listened to
    that? <BR> <BR>Back to topic, considering the sample is from &#39;85, I guess
    it&#39;s probably a digital version of Rockwell, but one that isn&#39;t available

    the top of my list, though his Gershwin  <BR>record was fine. BTW, The Girl from
    Ipanema was written in 1962, so Zoot <BR>couldn&#39;t have recorded it in 1956.

  body: Looking up my old Monotype books, I&#39;m quite certain the faces are Stymie
    Extrabold 390, and Stymie Extrabold Condensed 490. I used these types a lot in
    the fifties, and at one time was able to cast the Extrabold Condensed since the
    shop I apprenticed in had matrices for it. <BR> <BR>Have not seen it done as digital,
    but it would be a good thing to have available. It was a very complete family
    of types in light, medium, bold and extrabold. <BR> <BR>I have matrices for two
    or three sizes, and recently cast the seventy-two point Extrabold for the on-set
    printing of a newspaper for a TV pilot &#40;titled Peacemakers&#41; to be aired
    sometime this summer or fall. I was the un-tall and non-speaking printer pulling
    the handle of an Albion handpress. <BR> <BR>I have an unnatural fondness for the
    more unsophisticated jobbing types of the early part of the twentieth Century,
    and have a neat collection of bigger sizes:48, 60 72 pt. Things like Cooper Black,
    Alternate Gothic, Jefferson Gothic, Franklin Gothic, Onyx. The amazing things
    is that they are like new condition and cast very cleanly on the Super Caster.

  body: If you have McGrew&#39;s <i>American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century</i>
    handy, you&#39;ll see that ATF Stymies generally had the top-seriffed A, curve-legged
    R, and middle-serifless W. But the Mono Stymie Extrabold and Extrabold Condensed
    that Jim cited above have the opposite characteristics and match the Zoot Sims
    sample spot-on.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s interesting to note that the Mono Stymie Extrabold
    Italic has the top-seriffed A and the curve-legged R, while the W retains the
    middle serif.
