body: "Is there anyone that know of a font that allows to write in tower orientation,
  in software that does not allow vertical text ?\r\n\r\nBasically this means:\r\n
  \  * write text horizontally, left->right\r\n  * rotate media 90 degrees right\r\n
  \ * read text top to down, like in Chinese\r\n  * writing is English and numbers\r\n\r\nSo
  each character should be rotated 90 degrees in it's own cell.\r\n\r\nThe style is
  not really important.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to find such font. Any input ?\r\n\r\n

    usually simply called \"vertical setting\", but I'm not aware of a term for a

    regular left-to-right and the other with the glyphs turned a quarter to the left
    so they would read top-to-bottom. Can't remember which or whose font it was, though.\r\n\r\nEdit
    #1: I found it: Kingthings Conundrum. Lower case is turned."

  body: "On my system, I have a couple of fonts that use the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_uz.htm#vert\">OpenType
    tag 'vert'</a>, or an additional/ supplemental/ newer(?) implementation, 'vrt2',
    to implement 'faux-vertical' characters.\r\nAll of them are Adobe's CJK fonts:\r\n\r\nAdobe
    Fangsong Std\r\nAdobe Heiti Std\r\nAdobe Kaiti Std\r\nAdobe Song Std\r\n\r\nand
    (most likely) came free with my installation of Adobe InDesign. A few Windows
    system fonts contain selected symbols only. SimSun, for example, contains rotated
    brackets, braces, and curly quotes.\r\n\r\nThe odd thing, however, is that these
    characters are rotated <em>clockwise</em>:\r\n<blockquote>... forms suitable for
    vertical writing (that is, rotated 90 degrees clockwise). </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat
    means that applying the feature to a string \"hello\" will result in (vertically
    read) \"olleh\"! Then again maybe I'm missing some subtlety of vertical writing."
