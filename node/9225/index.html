<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody> <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6524.gif alt="ODF characters"> <br> <br>been on this for too long once again. the initials actually go inside a crest. but I'm having problems (more-so with the client) <br> <br>so its O.D.F eh. they want script fonts or cursive something or other. I started with Legacy. - they said it wasn't ledgible. (Its an abbrev. inside a crest where the entire organization name is going to be printed underneath on their forms...for crying out loud.) but its not ledgible they say...and some member got a creative hat on and found Shelley on his PC, passed it around and now their set on it. I refused - especially with their layout of it (diagonal decending scale of character overlaped and everything - I refrained from a freak out where I would have screamed about ledgibility. t h e y are telling m e this is more ledgible!? but I see its that old problem. whatever is on the PC operating system is ledgible. So, in a panic moment realizing they were about to reck my crest, I said I'd try something more "Shelley" to go in the crest - but after my merge of Legacy and Shelley-esque features its all gone wrong. <br> <br>can it be salvaged? do you see any potential? there's something about the finishes that's just not consistant. suggestions would be helpful. thanks <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Without seeing the design in context it is hard to make a judgement. <br> <br>Out of the three I like the one to the far right. <br> <br>From what you have given thus far I would say that you may be trying to force the symmetry to much. Mainly I see a problem with the "F". It looks like an "S" to me. If indeed it is an "F" it looks too much like a lower case "f". It should be as important as the "O" and the "D". <br> <br>The second one looks arabic, the dots are too much for me and the first, I think reaches (sorry) illegibility. <br> <br>Clients can be (are) a bitch. <br> <br>-smc</div>

<div class=commentbody>no way, #1 rocks. ledgibility be darned, <br>especially if the name will go right with <br>it. but i do agree that the f needs some <br>work. mainly to make it look like an <br>uppercase rather than lower. <br> <br>if you're feeling daring, ask them why they <br>felt the need to hire you if they could do <br>it themselves in the first place. they just <br>might agree that they don't need you, but <br>you can always just bill them for the work <br>so far. and please give them a message from me: <br>any of the first samples are better than the <br>second one you posted. good luck.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tanya: Just smile a lot, tell them they're genuises and their idea merely needs your professional polish, charge them more than you thought you would, and move on - hopefully the next one will be more worthy of an iota of creative effort. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>After all that time I spent worrying about the typography for them...I put my foot down and threw them the files and said to be done with it. <br> <br>check out what the had the nerve to suggest to me when one of their team had found photoshop.

<div class=commentbody>I think that is funny that people think that 3-D is more "professional" or finished". Every client should have access to Kai's Power Tools. Just Kidding. That would be lame. <br> <br>Perhaps it is too late, or your just plain done with it, but I think that the black type on the red could be lacking contrast. I don't have my Pantone book here so I could be wrong. But I have used black and this color before. <br> <br>I think knocking the "ODF" out, like the bottom one, might have a bit more punch. And I was wondering how it might look without the black frame. I guess what I am describing would be the bottom one- but red. <br> <br>Anyway, guess we can't expect every client to see with the same set of eyes that we see with. Over all, designing and getting paid for it keeps me happy and I hope it does you. If you think about it, we get paid to draw. What more could you ask? <br> <br>-smc</div>

<div class=commentbody>seanmicheal - good points. If I recover from bout of anger I'll try implementing your suggestions. There's a lot of mistakes in here still and while I had thought this was going to be a great opportunity where I could submit it here there and everywhere...(well really when don't I start thinking of all the greatness any project could be) its all been crushed & comprimised. <br> <br>to your second point though - I could transform this into a moral, ethical discussion about design....but suffice to say that I don't think our job is so easy to say we get paid to draw anymore then an architect gets paid to play with toothpicks. but I get your drift and it made me happy for a few. <br> <br>is that D so Disney or what. ahhhhh maybe I shouldn't look at it anymore</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm surprised they didn't ask for a design referencing the letters in a dressage ring (if I had a project like this, the cliche would prove irresistible)... given the geometry of dressage tests and the use of the letters set around a ring as "guide posts," this could've been such fun. <br> <br>Sorry about the difficult client...</div>

<div class=commentbody>We had thought about that Tracy - but in the end they realized they needed something that the general public could understand in order to get attendance. Plus something prestigious enough considering they are courting Mercedes for sponsorship. <br> <br>thanks</div>
