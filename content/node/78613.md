  BE medium...\r\non the flyers the type will be 12pts, but may then be scaled up
  to make posters etc...\r\n\r\nI am not an experienced typographer and i am unsure
  whether the optical setting looks better...\r\nOn a decent font like akzidenz i
  would normally trust the metric (auto) setting but the spacing just looks not quite
  right to me...\r\ndoes anyone have any words of advice? Any tips about tracking
  would also be welcome...\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerning_5452.jpg]"

  body: "thanks Nick, really appreciate the quick reply!\r\nI think i read somewhere
    that the kerning on the BE version isn't quite as good as some other versions
    of Akzidenz, have you personally noticed any problems?\r\nAm i right in thinking
    that generally speaking on high quality fonts the metric setting should be better
    as the kerning pairs have been set up by a professional typographer as oppose
    to the software calculating what should be best?\r\n\r\nthanks again!\r\n\r\nNeill\r\n"

    than large sized. In other words: when you scale up, make it tighter.\r\n\r\n(The
    one little thing in favour of QuarkXPress: one could set font-wide tracking relative
    to font-size \u2014 I would really like that in InDesign. Hint, hint.)"
