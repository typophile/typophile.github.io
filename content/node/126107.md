  body: "It appears to be OPTI Itzach-Heavy Oblique from OPTI-Castcraft (They are
    out of business and links on web to free versions seem to be down)\r\nThe fonts
    used to be free sites - it is the right font, you just have to find a copy."

  body: Turns out OPTI font was a clone - look at ITC Isbell Heavy Italic, that should
    do it!
