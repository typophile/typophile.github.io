  body: "Made a quick internet-recherche: \r\nCracked seems to be an illegal knock-off
    of the original <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/crackhouse\">Crackhouse</a>
    by House Industries. \r\nBlue Ridge seems to be a knock off too from <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/denver/\">TS
    Denver</a>. \r\nFound some infos about a font named Urban Scrawl Chill, but am
    not sure if that is the one you are looking for. "
