  / frowned upon, but I have a complete run of DYNAMIC GRAPHICS magazine (in like-new
  condition) that needs a new home.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not just chuck these in the
  recycling bin -- heck, recouping some of my expenses for the costs of the magazine
  would be nice! -- but I figured I would ask here first, as this is one of the few
  design-oriented forums that I frequent.\r\n\r\nTo my thinking, shipping cost would
  be the main obstacle to getting these out to someone.  Because each issue weighs
  close to a pound, even Media Mail could get expensive, so I was thinking of shipping
  these by UPS Ground to any interested party.\r\n\r\nIf by some chance somebody is
  interested in these, he or she can email me directly at jshallri@cox.net and we
  can discuss things further.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and interest,\r\nJohn S.
  Hall"
