body: "I have spent a lot of times reading the other threads in this forum, and I
  must say that I am slightly ashamed of posting a logo of such inferior quality...
  but you have to start somewhere.\r\n\r\nI am creating a logo for our company, b10
  solutions inc. The company will provide consulting services in bioinformatics (computer
  science applied to biology). I wanted the logo to be simple and to show a mix of
  both fields, so I constructed the word \"bio\" (biology) out of 0's and 1's (computers).
  It's not really original, but I find it better than using a double helix to represent
  biology (examples of double helixes on top of my head: <a href=\"http://www.idtdna.com/images/home/home_pic_logo.gif\">IDT</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.genomecanada.ca/GCimages/navigation/logo.jpg\">Genome Canada</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.sanbi.ac.za/GenomeAfrica/Sanbi_logo1.gif\">Sanbi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stratagene.com/templates/images/logo1.gif\">Stratagene</a>,

  Can</a>).\r\n\r\nAs you will probably notice instantly when looking at the attached
  logo, I have no formation whatsoever in graphic design (only an interest). We unfortunately
  cannot afford to pay for a graphic designer at this time. We definitedly will one
  day.\r\n\r\nOf course, I will be really thankful of any comment or critique I get
  concerning the logo, but I am particularly interested to find out about basic or
  technical errors I made. Things that anyone with some education in graphic design
  will spot right away.\r\n"

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to

    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get

  body: A few thoughts, one its a forced concept, second it doesn't read bio unless
    you tell someone it does. I would also question the name "bio" it may already
    taken and copywrited. I also feel in general if the mark can't be read in black
    and white its not strong enough. Stick with a simple type treatment that can easily
    be read and do your marketing with either a tag line or accompaning copy.

      I should have mentioned that it has to clearly read b10 (b one zero) which is
      the name of the company and which we know we can use freely.

  body: "Bird,\r\nWhen you pronounce the name of the company do you call it \"bee
    ten\" or \"bee one zero\", or should it be bilingual? Should it include \"solutions
    inc\" in the title, in which case it would be a mistake to leave that out when
    considering the logo design. The suggestion Jan made of separating by using colour
    would result in the b being treated as a separate element in the pronunciation,
    you could also use a zero with a diagonal crossbar to make it clear that it is
    a numeral, and by extension the character next to it is also (because it has the
    same height and colour). The b needs some attention try making the ascender lead
    into the counter like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=pump\">Pump</a>,
    not necessarily with the open counter, just the junction of the two elements at
    the base and keeping the echo of the 1 in the curve at the top. A point about
    printing orange, like purple it is difficult to get it to print satisfactorily
    using 4 colour process.\r\n\r\nChrisG,\r\nAt the moment, since the redesign, it
    is not possible to upload images unless you are the creator of a thread, when
    you can add them to the initial post. You might also want to read this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14424\">thread</a>.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

  body: "Bird,\r\nMy question related to how you space the characters, to see if it
    was possible to infer the pronounciation from their appearance. A customer, seeing
    your company name might presume bee-ten, it might be worth your while practising
    with the spacing to see if you can produce the correct pronounciation.\r\nThe
    problems with reproducing orange are due to the limited colours that yellow and
    magenta can produce, generally they reproduce as a brown. Your printer should
    be able to tell you what he would prefer, but I would go for something like 100%
    yellow and 50-60% magenta. The effects will also be influenced by the type of
    stock you are printing on.\r\nTim"

    slightly modified it and attached the result. I find the modified one more consistent,
    but I still don't know which I prefer it.\r\n\r\nThe modified design uses 100%
    yellow / 50% magenta according to photoshop's CMYK model. On my home monitor,
    it produces a satisfactory color. How much will that change on real paper with
    real ink, I don't know.\r\n\r\nI have tried to play with the spacing, and I agree
    with what Chris G said to me by email: \"I think this does not necessarily make
    the matter any clearer\".\r\n\r\nChris G asked if it would be possible to use
    \"B 1 ZERO\" to communicate the pronunciation of the name (\"zero\" is \"z\xE9ro\"
    in french, but \"one\" is \"un\"). Technically, yes, but I dislike the inconsistency
    it would bring (why have \"1\" written as \"1\" and \"0\" as \"ZERO\"?).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That junction of stem and bowl on the b makes a dark spot in your new design.
    The same x-height removes the b-one-zero reading and returns it to bio. The binary
    look you were trying to employ overwhelms the logo in your new designs.\r\nThe
    strapline is not positioned well under the logotype, it appears to overhang to
    the right (because of the curve of the 0); it is also a bit light for use in all
    applications, a business card for example, the tracking/kerning is too loose,
    especially apparent in the INC, you should be aiming for even optical spaces when
    kerning, a method for checking kerning is to print it out and view it upsidedown
    with half closed eyes, the light areas should appear similar in size. \r\nAs a
    final point it is more useful to create your logos in a vector drawing program
    (like Adobe Illustrator or Freehand) because that will allow you to enlarge the
    logo without worrying about resolution and the file size will be smaller, it will
    also be easier to create 4 colour, spot colour and rgb versions. If you continue
    with Photoshop, for most print uses you will need to have the logo at least at
    300dpi at the size you intend to use it.\r\nTim"

    body: thanks timd, I will take the time to correctly read and understand your
      post as soon as possible (stem, bowl, x-height, strapline, etc. are all terms
      I am not familiar with). I just want to point out that the logo is composed
      directly in Scalable Vector Graphics format (SVG) using a text editor (like
      notepad). I was using photoshop only to look at colors and to quickly copy/paste
      "SOLUTIONS INC" from Chris G's design to my modified design.
