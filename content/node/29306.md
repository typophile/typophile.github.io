  body: "There are 2 styles shown on the page you reference -- a serif and a sans.
    To match the serif, an obvious choice would be <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=clarendon&image.x=0&image.y=0\">Clarendon</a>.
    For a less obvious one, I'd look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=M.206.0.2\">Egyptian
    72</a>.\r\n\r\nSkylar\r\n"
