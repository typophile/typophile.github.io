  body: It's possible they used <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/futura_std_bold/?sample_text=LUDOMAC">Futura</a>
    for some of the characters.

  body: "It is certainly a modified version of Stop by Aldo Novarese (also known as
    a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/customstop/\">Custom Stop</a>!). <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/verbosus/2753288364/in/pool-customstop\">Here
    is an instance of the M in Stop modified in a very similar way</a>. The U and
    C are from an entirely different font, likely to be Futura as Stephen suggested;
    you can also tell they don\u2019t fit by the fact that they aren\u2019t overshooting
    properly and their weight is not quite right compared to the other shapes."

  body: "Thanks Stephen: I have a couple more items to post in the next few days.
    In Italy it\u2019s pretty easy to run into Custom Stops, especially if you\u2019re
    travelling on motorways and such. In the UK I found many instances of Stop too,
    but it looks like they don\u2019t like fiddling with it as much as we do!"

  body: "Yes, that\u2019s definitely a possibility although I haven\u2019t tracked
    down any instance of it so far. Stop is so easy to customise that I wouldn\u2019t
    be surprised to find hacked copies of it in rogue type foundries\u2019 catalogues.
    Yesterday for example I spent some time browsing dafont.com and found this <a
    href=\"http://www.dafont.com/galant.font\">Galant</a> which is just one giant
    Custom Stop. I am also not aware of any alternate versions by Aldo himself."
