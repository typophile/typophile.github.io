    Tabs palette: right next to the field that shows the tab position, you'll find
    a field for \"Leader:\". Fill that with a period, or period space, or centered
    period, or whatever else you would want to have repeated as a tab leader.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "A possible problem with dot leaders is that these sometimes don\u2019t look
    very nice when too close to the glyph before them. I recently saw an alternative
    way of constructing them: Make a characterstyle with a dotted underline that shifts
    up. Apply that to the space.\r\n\r\n[Edit: corrected typo\u2019s.]"
