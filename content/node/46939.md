  go at a simple compostion myself. I'm trying to go for a futuristic/experimental
  look with the typeface that I created. How do you think it looks?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nCharlie"

    see a sort of modular structure.\r\n\r\nCan you tell something about the background?"

  body: I like it. The t is too experimental... looks too much like a b. Keep going.
    I have no idea what the thing before the t is, either. Finish the alphabet and
    set it in some sample text and look for problems. Tweak the letters until they
    work. Then start over. If you were taking up painting, you wouldn't expect your
    first painting to be a museum piece, right? :)

  body: "Experimental, a bit illegible at the beginning. I think something that may
    help is if you take into consideration identifiability of the tops and bottoms
    of letters. Typically, if you take a sentence of a typeface and cover the bottom
    half, you'll be able to read what the top half still says.\r\n\r\nHowever, if
    you cover the top half, it becomes more difficult to read. Your typeface seems
    to have a uniformity to the top and bottom. That's not necessarily bad, but it
    does make the eyes take a bit longer to identify what the letter is."
