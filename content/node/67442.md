body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nThis is an assignment for my Brand Identity class in the Visual
  Communication program at SAIC. My brief was to re-brand Fifth Third Bank*, a regional
  bank in the American Midwest. The bank was started in Ohio and their current branding
  was just redone by  [[https://www.53.com/wps/portal/personal|Deskey]], a brand consultancy
  firm that also does Pepto Bismol's packaging]] but I and my class feel that its
  missing the mark entirely. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe first few are variations on a wheat
  sheaf, representing the values of growth and security, and history. The others are
  variations on a turtle icon that also has suggestion of a 5 and 3. I chose a turtle
  because I think most bank logos are way too generic looking, especially the current
  5/3 logo. There is also zero humor is most bank logos and I'd like to change that.
  Tortoises are some of the longest living animals on earth. \r\n\r\n*Disclosure-
  I bank here and wish I didn't because their customer service quality has been less
  than average.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/WheatSheafsandTurtlesSilas_5450.png]"

  body: The turtle idea is interesting -- I immediately thought of the tortoise vs.
    hare story, and how applicable that analogy is in light of the recent banking
    crises. But the old-age link is great as well. I would not, however, get the idea
    of tortoise from the abstracted shapes in 1d-f if you hadn't mentioned it in your
    description. This is a concept where you're already asking the viewer to get the
    idea of what the tortoise represents, so I would maybe make the visual representation
    of that tortoise as literal as possible. An old engraving might be one option
    -- something that communicates "we've been here a long time," like the Wells-Fargo
    horse-drawn carriage.

  body: "Overlays seem to be au courant (thanks perhaps to work like [[http://pentagram.com/en/new/2008/12/new-work-truvia.php|Paula
    Scher's \"Truvia\" logotype]]) (Why those particular colors in the A1 sample plus
    another overlay color?)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Scher, it seems banks (and many
    other institutions) love to use the \"thick-typeface-word-then-thin-typeface\"
    bit as a visual word separator. I recalled noticing she used that with her Citi-stuff
    (citibank, citifinancies, cititravelers, etc.) [[http://logodesignerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/citibank.jpg|
    Scher's Thick-first-word, thin-second-word logotype]]  \r\n\r\n(I guess I've got
    Scher on the brain today)..."

  body: "Thank for your feedback FeeltheKern. I'm working on a engraving style one
    but I'm hesitant to make it look too dated (faux engravings often remind me of
    the clip art revival of the 90s by Charles Anderson and etc..) \r\n\r\nAnd  to
    answer your question designpuck, I chose those colors, because their friendly,
    familiar, and bright. Or probably because Paul Rand used them often to make his
    overlays (as noted in his book Design, Form, and Chaos) and I was just reading
    it. To me the overlay implies a growth (which you want in a bank), a multiplying
    effect.\r\n\r\nAnother reason overlays are popular is because they are efficient?
    They often create new colors. I need to think more about this...  \r\n\r\nAgain
    thank you! I will continue working and post updates. "

    I'm liking the upper left type better (its Rotis Semi Sans).\r\n\r\nYour praise
    and criticism is greatly encouraged. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FifthThirdBankRedux_5227.jpg]"

    kind of seed tied together with a string.\r\n\r\nNot a big fan of the type. The
    type you have in 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d is much nicer."

  body: Thanks, katttor. Yeah, I figured that making the V black would be enough of
    a contrast for that not to happen. But yeah, its a issue..

    field with rows to be sowed which is so common in the midwest.

  body: "I'd like to thank everybody for the suggestions. I presented my work to the
    class today to a positive reception. Hola, I can't remember if I made a variation
    like that in my sketching or not. I like the simplicity, but formally the V shape
    looks unbalanced. Here are some of the finished and printed collateral pieces.
    I used a unpolished drawing style and bright color palette to contrast the restraint
    of the logo. \r\n\r\nI'll still be working on more related designs for my portfolio.
    Thanks again! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/printedmaterials_5339.jpg]"
