  the text face, and we discovered when proofing the book the string \"WHQ,\" occurs
  52 times in the text. Q-comma overprints badly.\r\n\r\nWith Arno, the kern needed
  for Q followed by a comma is about 200 units -- 10 units more than a nominal wordspace.
  For this book, we just used the large kern, but what I think is really needed is
  an alternate Q with a shorter or deeper tail. Swap it in (calt) when followed by
  a comma, semicolon, or a space -- or maybe only with a space followed by capital
  J, A, whatever. The calt feature is nice that way. Because the needed kern is larger
  than a wordspace, an alternate Q and calt feature on my short list for the Arno
  we use here.\r\n\r\nIf this was limited to Arno, I'd not bother to post. But it's
  a problem we see with a number of fonts, so maybe you'd like to consider fixes other
  than kerning when you draw up fonts where the Q's have substantial tails."

    fonts, I also kern hyphens, commas, periods, colons, semicolons and curly and
    non-curly single and double quotes...

    short tailed Q default,(IRAQ) and putting in the first stylistic an instruction
    to substitute Qu with the traditional long-tailed Q. There is also a stylistic
    set that substitutes in all the historical style characters, so the long-tailed
    Q is everywhere then. '

  body: 'William: What I''ve been doing in my font (whose J, j, f, y tend to create
    collisions), is maintaing a list of letters that cause collisions (have descenders
    on the right side, in the case of J and Y, or spaces, since they just looked weird).  That
    way, whenever possible, the longer preferred form is used, but automatically switches
    to a shortened form as necessary.  Basically like what you''ve had to do with
    the Q+u, but doing it with Q+[abcedfhiklmnoqrstuvwxz].  You can have either one
    be the default in that case.'

  body: "Ivan, adding a third space is probably a bad idea, if the InDesign files
    you're creating will be used for any other purpose, as they would in bookwork
    -- unless you know for sure that the result isn't the insertion of any Unicode
    *character*, such as the 3-to-em space. You need to export everything InDesign
    will let you & check to see what's there. On the other hand, we know a kern won't
    show up as a character, but AFAIK, you can't insert a kern with the InDesign Find/Replace
    tool. \r\n\r\nThe problem Q with the long tail mentioned above is the standard
    Q in Arno. There is an optional Q. It has a longer tail.\r\n\r\nWhat is (to me)
    a problem flag with any glyph is where it needs to be kerned to a following glyph
    using a kern value approaching or exceeding a wordspace. This may not give rise
    to any visual nightmares (be a problem) in some cases, but often is in others.
    That's when a solution is needed. Redraw the glyph, create an alternate with an
    accompanying feature that will automatically resolve the problem, something like
    that. "

    you can use InDesign\u2019s GREP search, and the \u2018positive lookahead\u2019
    feature.\r\n1. Create a character style that sets the needed kern.\r\n2. Search
    for <code>Q(?=,)</code> \u2013 a \u2018Q\u2019, only if followed by a comma.\r\n3.
    Replace with your style.\r\n\r\nSince CS4, you can make this even shorter and
    use a GREP <em>style</em> that automatically searches for this pattern and applies
    the desired formatting on the fly.\r\n\r\nI know this is not the same as \u2018inserting
    a kern\u2019, and you probably were already aware of this functionality.\r\nFlorian"

  body: Florian, yes, that would work. Some people, on export, do include character
    styles, so you might be setting up a *situation* later. Not a big deal. You can
    insert a kern through scripting too. Just not through the Find/replace pulldown
    pallet.
