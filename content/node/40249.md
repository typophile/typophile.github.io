  personally have the Isonorm 3098 version... Can anybody tell me what the '3098'
  actually means? The different versions have additions like, 'g' 'sb' 'b', yet appear
  to be exactly the same, apart from a variation on the 'a' in some versions...\r\n\r\ncan
  anybody give me more info on the typeface... more out of curiosity than anything
  else..\r\n\r\nThanks. C."

  body: "Hi Charles,\r\n\r\nNot sure if you'll find this given the age of the original
    post, but I came across it while searching for more Isonorm goodness three years
    on...\r\n\r\nThe '3098' refers to the International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO) standard for lettering in technical drawings (ISO 3098-1:1974) because the
    font adheres to the design standards set out therein. There's a whole classification
    system to this typeface and the various letters include V (vertical) or S (slanted,
    or italic) variations etc.\r\n\r\nA and B sets were designed for use with either
    stencils or transfers (remember this is a font whose design predates common use
    of computers to create technical drawings for engineers and architects - back
    in university days I remember using some wonderful Rotring stencils made from
    transparent orange plastic for the 3098 font). CA and CB were designed for CAD
    software use. Another descriptive letter indicates the ratio of the height of
    the character to the width of the stroke used - I can't remember the letters these
    days but the two options for the ratio are 1/14 or 1/10. Depending on the country
    you're in, the standard is one or the other I recall (another aspect specified
    by country is the style of the lower case 'a' and whether or not the '7' has a
    bar across it). The entire standard specifies all sorts of sizes by reference
    to the letter height - ascender and descender heights, space between words (between
    0.6h and 2h), leading (not less than 0.6h), etc. as well as a basic style guide
    (upper and lower case usage, no underlining of letters, decimal points sit on
    the base line and the like). Think of it as 'what happens to an art like typography
    when engineers get their sticky mitts on it' and you won't be disappointed!\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of the font family, you'll see only one letter specified and notice slight
    differences in the character sets between them (breaks in stencilled letters,
    etc.) which are driven by practical considerations for the intended implementation.
    When defining the sytle guide for a technical drawing though, you'd expect to
    see a full type specification to indicate character set, vertical or slant, height
    to stroke weight ratio, etc. for every style used.\r\n\r\nCommon use of the standard
    also indicates a typographic scale, i.e. 5mm for small print on diagrams, 10 for
    body text, 14 for headings and 20 for titles commonly. Yes, that's millimetres
    - this being a standard it defines absolute values, not point sizes for character
    height. \r\n\r\nThe combination of all these factors in the overall specification
    is intended to allow for maximum overall legibility, even when plans and other
    technical drawings have become slightly damaged (through repeated folding, general
    wear and tear on site, etc.) leading to the odd part of a letter being 'lost'
    in the process.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of type foundries producing versions
    of this font, but to your point of how similar they all are I guess a lot depends
    on how accurately the foundries have been able to recreate the original specifications.\r\n\r\nHTH!"
