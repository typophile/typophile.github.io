    are some alternatives.</a>

    to cut it.\r\n\r\nAdriane - I have a feeling CastleType\u2019s Futura went off
    the market due to trademark restrictions. I'll find out from Jason Castle."

  body: "Thanks, Adriane, for the links leading to <a href=\"http://www.castletype.com/home.html\">Castle
    Type</a>!\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone else find it odd that Carisma Inline is all-caps,
    but the rest of the Carisma family is upper and lower case?"
