  body: Strange, at first sight, it looks like Gotham but, after further inspection,
    that's definitely not it for "Fly into this festive season/unique". /q is totally
    off, /f and /t look different too... May be a custom version of Gotham or a mix
    of 2 different types ("rebel/be" and "Fly into this festive season/unique")...
    What's the sample origin?
