  if I had FontLab I could import each glyph and slim it down? Maybe I just need to
  redraw it as a lighter weight? Suggestions/ideas? Bash the whole freakin' project
  too if you will! :-D"

  body: I've tried going in and adjusting each glyph but it just ends up looking like
    crap. I'd like to hear your advice, but looks like I'm just going to have to redraw
    it, unless some good samaritan would like to tweak the outlines in FL for me?
    :-P

  body: I don't think there is any escaping hand tuning, but you might try FontLab's
    bold command, or even Illustrator's "Offset Path" command to get you part of the
    way there.

  body: "Best thing to do if to do it by hand\u2026 Making lighter version of a glyphs
    is the same drawing process as for the bold. You need to report a pre-defined
    weight on each stem and correct visually the thick and thin. Your glyph normally
    will be a little condensed compare to the bold version. Hope my explanations sound
    clear ;)"
