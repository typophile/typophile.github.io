  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>There seem to be a couple of bugs with InDesign CS3 &amp; CS4 that affect the characters that can be included in a font.</p>
<p>First: If Unicode characters 2002 through 200B are included in a font, InDesign CS3 and CS4 will crash under certain circumstances. Specifically, if you enter 9 (nine) em spaces in a line and uni2003 is included in a font, IDCS3 and IDCS4 crash. We learned of this while setting a Cataloging-in-Publication page, where you often get 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 (signifying print runs) separated by an em-space. Turns out it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if it is an em, en, thin, whatever, just any combination of 9 characters from uni2002 through uni200B on a single line.</p>
<p>It has to be nine characters. Eight is fine, 10 is fine. We got around this by putting the numbers on two lines, and used two en-spaces between one group. When the return was deleted, we had <em>10</em> space characters from this region in the line, and the program didn&rsquo;t crash.</p>
<p>I suppose this argues for leaving such characters out of a font. But not all layout programs treat spaces as a part of the program rather than the font. And some people already include 2000 through 200B in their fonts &ndash; SIL Charis, for example. It does seem a bug worthy of a fix when a sequence of valid Unicode characters crashes a program. But it&rsquo;s each font designer&rsquo;s call; the way we proved out the bug was to simply to remove these characters from the font, regenerate the .otf, &amp; rely on InDesign&rsquo;s routines for the spaces. No crash with the characters removed.</p>
<p>The second bug occurs when there are no characters in the Private Use region of E020 through E07E. If there are no such characters in a font, and you enter the Unicode sequence from the keyboard with ID-CS2, 3 (and I think 4), the program places the characters from the Controls and Basic Latin plane &ndash; i.e., a space through an ASCII tilde (0020 through 007E).</p>
<p>This might argue for putting the glyph used for .notdef in E020 through E07E if you&rsquo;re not using them for some purpose. That would at least let somebody know there could be a problem with the document. While it would be unusual for somebody to enter such characters from the keyboard, I, for one, have been known to make mistakes when keying . . .</p>
<p>FWIW,</p>
<p>Charles</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Charles, thanks for the feedback.
I was able to reproduce the second problem and filed a bug. However, I&rsquo;m unable to reproduce the first issue. I tried both ID CS4 (v6.0.3) and CS3 (v5.0.4) using Charis SIL Regular (v4.100). Here are the steps I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch ID CS4</li>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Create a new text frame</li>
<li>Select the font &ldquo;Charis SIL Regular&rdquo;</li>
<li>Type the sequence &ldquo;10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>No crash happened. Can you please retest this or provide more info? Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miguel, thanks for taking an interest in this. I know Adobe doesn&rsquo;t use uni2002-uni200B, and not many other people do either.</p>
<p>We tried our test again, starting with a new document and your procedure. This did not produce the crash. As I&rsquo;m sure you know, debugging can be a painful process, esp. as we started things on a 64-bit Vista machine running a plug-in dictionary.</p>
<p>To start clean with ID CS4, we used my 32-bit Vista machine with the box-stock proximity dictionary. I was able to get the program to fail converting 9 em spaces, but not quite as simply as originally described.</p>
<p>What we did to recreate the problem was to open a new document, create a new text frame (font Consula), type in two lines of gibberish, type in a third line of 9-em spaces. Now highlight the em spaces and change the font to Charis SIL. Repeated this test several times. Sometime the failure was immediate, sometimes a further action such as <em>zoom</em> or <em>file save</em> was needed. We opened &amp; saved a new document between each failure to try &amp; clear anything ID was hanging on to.</p>
<p>Not to say it isn&rsquo;t a problem we created, we do some oddball stuff. BTW, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be just Charis SIL, I also tried one of my modified fonts which include the U+2002-U+200B characters, with the same result. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to going back into those fonts to take the offending characters out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sent you the file and a screen shot of the message that appears when the program quits.</p>
