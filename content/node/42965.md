  won't let you even join. Hmm...\r\n\r\nTypophiles name should be on this page and

  body: "I have written information but when I click submit, it says you need to log
    in. How funny is that. The reason I'm signing up is because I want to become a
    member and log in but if they won't let anyone become a member, then you can't
    log in. \r\n\r\nPS Dano...I know it says 'how to join' but no point if the website
    doesn't work properly and doesn't know what it's meant to do."

    and mail it to them with a check (or cheque, rather), and mail it to them. Presumably,
    they will send you a username and password somehow. \r\n\r\nThe fields at the
    bottom look like they are only for posting comments about the form. Maybe they
    are using some kind of blog content management system for their site and don't
    know how to suppress display of the comment section at the bottom."
