  so many good resources. \r\n\r\nThe time has come where I think I need some opinions!
  I'm currently working on a logo / website redesign for a company much in need of
  it (their website design hasn't been updated in 15 years, Yes I'm serious). They
  sell art supplies, specifically fiber art supplies (think Tie-Dye, batik, etc).
  I'm looking for a font that I can use that isn't sterile, or too corporate\u2014but
  that can still be taken seriously. Most likely a sans (but doesn't have to be).
  Something that will appeal to wholesalers buying large amount of fabric for costume
  design, and to the home crafter. The company is a cross between a Michael's Craft
  Supply and a Cost Plus. The company is quirky and silly at times, another playful
  font choice would be nice as well. \r\n\r\nThank you all so much for your input!"
