body: "Hello everybody,\r\ncould you write me some opinions about my new text type
  project, please?\r\nIt is Italic family which includes left and right leaning roman
  and italic version.\r\nAs a first I wanted to design just left leaning but later
  I add right variant.\r\nI'm the most interested if the left roman version is enough
  readable for you as a text type.\r\n\r\nThank you so much.\r\nSlavka"

  body: "First off: nice work!\r\nThe left slanted roman is definitely readible although
    it might be a bit straining on the eyes for longer texts. It's quite hard to estimate
    how it'd effect legibility in the long run, but I guess going against the grain
    of the reading flow it might end up becoming tiring.\r\nStill I have to say it
    looks really good & would definitely be able to serve certain purposes."

  body: I think the letterspacing is too tight (and the wordspace probably too wide,
    but turn off full justification to test). Judging its readability would be easier
    with that remedied.

  body: "So this thing doesn't have an upright at all,\r\nand each of the two slanted
    cuts has an Italic.\r\n\r\nSome people would call this gimmicky. I myself\r\nam
    a big fan of finding alternative methods of\r\nemphasis, so I'd love to see this
    explored more.\r\nFor example you could use a \xABdirection\xBB's own\r\nitalic
    for mild emphasis, and the italic from\r\nthe other \xABdirection\xBB for stronger
    emphasis.\r\nCombined with different weights, the \xABemphasis\r\npalette\xBB
    would become quite rich.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the character of the design itself,\r\nthe
    main thing I'm wondering about is whether\r\nthe backslant italic should actually
    be more\r\nthan just a mechanical job; maybe it would be\r\ncool to make it reflect
    chirography, for example\r\nthe arches could be <em>flatter</em> than the Roman...\r\n\r\nHowever
    the Roman I would actually consider\r\nmaking less chirographic; for example I'd
    make\r\nthe serifs symmetrical. This would further\r\ndistinguish the Romans from
    the Italics.\r\n\r\nThe \"g\" is wonderful - maybe make it <em>slightly</em>\r\nless
    top-heavy. I'd raise the tittles, and make\r\nthe ascenders a bit taller.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I checked out your (?) site\r\nhttp://www.gd2.cz/cs/page/slava-jevcinova/minus-five-degrees\r\nand
    I'm seeing some nice original thoughts. Keep it up!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Nice! I've been thinking about back slanting italics for better Hebrew integration.
    Nice to see some other examples.\r\n\r\nI agree about the eye of the 'g' - just
    a tad too large. I would also consider making the arm of the 'r' slightly smaller."

  body: "You know, for the longest time I thought right-leaning\r\nItalics were not...
    kosher :-) for Hebrew. For one thing\r\nthey're totally not in its sister-script,
    Arabic. I think\r\nI simply didn't want to believe it's OK (being an anti-\r\nLatinization
    myrmidon) and I dismissed the various\r\nexamples of it (like the El-Al logo*,
    if memory serves)\r\nas deluded. But I'm not sure any more, and if I were to\r\nbet
    the house (not that I'm a gambler) I think these days\r\nI'd put my money on \"it's
    OK\". Maybe since Israelis are\r\nvery tech-oriented they've moved even further
    from\r\nhandwriting than Westerners.\r\n\r\n* Although airplane directionality\r\nprovides
    an extra twist there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hmmm, if it looks gimmicky I'm sorry. But my concept was to try design left
    leaning text type. From the beginning it was just left leaning, but then I added
    also right slanted. I was considering also about upright italic / classic roman,
    but I'm worry that in this case people will not notice the Italic so much. So
    I don't know, maybe I will add it later.\r\nEspecially I like combination left
    roman with right italic :)\r\n\r\nFor sure I plan more weights, but unfortunately
    right now I have just this one.\r\n\r\nI quite don't understand your idea about
    italic's directions. Do you think that I should make more version??? or what did
    you mean?\r\n\r\n\"symmetrical serifs \" - so you think that I should leave out
    smoothly flow into stem from one side? I did it because I wanted to keep in roman
    also some element from handwriting\u2026\r\n\r\nhmmm\u2026\r\n\r\nBtw, this web
    side is from my University and you saw my first typeface :)\r\nbut it's not finished
    yet, maybe I will post some new improvements later :)\r\n\r\nthank you so much

  body: "Well, it's not that it <em>looks</em> gimmicky. It's just that\r\none has
    to think about Design, and what you're trying\r\nto achieve. Making something
    simply because you can\r\nisn't Design. In fact one Famous Designer who has made\r\nan
    upright-Italic pretty much said he did it because he\r\nhad always wanted to make
    one... It didn't seem to matter\r\nthat the style is pretty much useless for emphasis
    (as you\r\nstate yourself).\r\n\r\nNow, you might instinctively know that it's
    a good idea,\r\nbut to make it usable to others you will have to figure\r\nout
    <em>why</em> it's a good idea; that's the only way to develop\r\nit fruitfully.\r\n\r\nItalic
    directions: well, it would be nice to have multiple\r\nslants (or even a slant
    Multiple-Master axis) but I think\r\nyou should start with one for each direction.
    Just make\r\nsure the amount of slant is enough, but not too much.\r\nThis depends
    mostly on the intended usage size, which\r\nis a product of weight, vertical proportions
    and spacing.\r\n\r\nThe Roman's serifs: yes, forget handwriting. Don't willfully\r\nshun
    its <em>products</em>, but don't treat it as some sort of ideal.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
