  using FontLab on Windows 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I cant get the font to
  display in MS Word as well as InDesign.\r\nNo glyphs are shown. Only .NOTDEF shows
  for each character. I guess this has something to do with encoding, but cant figure
  out where to look for the solution.\r\n\r\nKindly help.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards."

    body: "Thanks Bob H,\r\n\r\nI'm aware of these documentations.\r\n\r\nI'm struggling
      with encoding of the font. I've created all Isolated glyphs with their corresponding
      Unicode IDs, but for some weird reason the font is not showing those  glyphs
      in MS Word. \r\ne.g. Alef_Isol has its proper Unicode ID (0627) applied in FontLab.
      When I Generate Font and install it and type Alef in MS Word it is not displayed.
      (the font changes to Times New Roman).\r\n\r\nHope this explains my problem.\r\n\r\nThanks
      and regards."

  body: "Perhaps Word automatically attempts to use the correct initial, medial, and
    final forms, and ignores your Isolated forms.\r\n\r\nI don't know about Word,
    but InDesign allows you to manually select the forms. IIRC it also defaults to
    'Automatic', but in the Character panel menu \u25BA OpenType \u25BA Positional
    Forms you can select \"Isolated Form\".\r\n\r\nIf this works and you are not planning
    to add the other glyphs, you could simply copy your glyphs into the positions
    for the others."

    have been correctly applied. This will rule out the possibility that the bug is
    in the font cmap table.\r\n\r\nAs I recall, Windows apps expect any Arabic font
    to contain the OpenType GSUB features for init, medi and fina form substitutions,
    and may presume any Arabic font without them to be broken."

  body: "You can't turn of basic script shaping features via OpenType Layout UI controls.
    Such controls are intended to control discretionary typographic features (as in
    the case of the Gabriola ligatures in your other test), not fundamental features
    of writing systems. The init, medi and fina features are applied by default to
    the Arabic script, and cannot be turned off. If one wants to disable such shaping,
    one has to do so via Unicode control characters such as zero-width non-joiner
    (U+200C).\r\n\r\n[Note that what you describe in the MSDN forum as an Arabic 'ligature'
    is not, in fact a ligature, but an init glyph followed by a fina glyph.]"

    I figured it, and correctly pointed out by John Hudson, the CMAP table was corrupt
    for my font.\r\n\r\nThe solution:  I created a new font file from scratch and
    copy pasted the glyphs from old to new file.\r\nLittle bit of hassle, but the
    font is in initial stages so it was not a big deal.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I would
    request the community here to create a template for Basic Arabic font, and provide
    it as an starter for beginners. Or, if such resource exists provide a pointer
    to it.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the helpful answers."
