body: "Hello! I'm not a big fonthead, but I know enough to know that using more than
  a few fonts on a single web page is quite risky.\r\n\r\nI did this design in one
  night with no particular idea in mind from the start, and I was quite satisfied
  with the result. However, I'm using a weird mix of fonts, so I'd like to know if
  anyone would have a strong opinion on my choices!\r\n\r\nI'm using Lucida Sans Unicode
  uppercase for headers and logotype, Garamond for most content and navigation, and
  here is where I doubt my design skills: I'm mixing with small-caps Trebuchet MS
  (READ MORE links and search bar) and Georgia for the dates.\r\n\r\nAlthough doing
  that is something I tend to avoid, I think the result is pretty OK... what do you
  think?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.epgui.com/?b=1|http://www.epgui.com/]]"
