		<div class="commentbody"><p>Without getting too deep in history, many corporations and countless high-end publishers of books and periodicals had one or several type families customized for their particular use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;off-the-rack&rdquo; fashions and tailor-fit clothing. Generally, &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; solutions need a certain amount of tweaking in order to be really good. By customizing widths, kerning pairs, character shapes, you cut down on the need to tweak and produce quality typesetting with uniformity and consistency.</p>
<p>The purpose is not to create a new variation of the typeface. It&rsquo;s to improve the output.</p>

<p>I often have to modify a font a bit if I am going to use it for letterpress or if for normal print, to provide for different weighting.</p>
<p>Minion was available as a MM font once upon a time and multiple masters did anticipate user interaction in regard to manipulating a font.</p>
<p>I realize that a lot of type foundryes these days indicate in their terms of contract that you are not to modify a font but hey, I paid for Fontographer and FontLab and the right to use the PostScript or TrueType or OpenType formats just like they did.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go too far back in type technologies to realize that all type design is tied to format or delivery device. And the owner of that has the real say about it all. Prior to 1986 you literally had to &ldquo;submit&rdquo; a design to ITC if you wanted your typeface out there (no other options).</p>
<p>Reselling or redistibution of a font is a no no clearly but modification, nonsense. Hell I can modify a font by adjusting the software in my printer.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you all think modification for design ownability is a little bit of a cop-out? I mean they  might as well get new designs.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here is where old battle lines have been drawn.</p>
<p>On one side, the designer of typefaces.
On the other side, the &ldquo;expert&rdquo; user of typefaces, sometimes referred to as typographer and/or type director.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sat (or sometimes stood in pubs) between typographer and designer as they argued the point. For my part I am closer to being a typographer and have never drawn a single character that was ever released.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;expert&rdquo; user is never content to leave alone what irritates them visually. And the type designer simply can&rsquo;t please everyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of those relationships that you may not like, but I feel it keeps the art alive.</p>
<p>Other than that, it simply isn&rsquo;t practical or downright impossible to go back to the original designer for modifications. Once a typeface has moved through one, two or several re-cuts over years or even centuries, the &ldquo;original&rdquo; designer&rsquo;s intent may have been lost completely. That&rsquo;s why I used to examine earlier specimens of third-iteration typefaces, not to nit-pick but to try and understand the original intent of the designer.</p>
<p>For some people it&rsquo;s a sin to leave well enough alone. 
Hmmm&hellip; I think this sauce needs a little more basil. How could that chef miss something so obvious as that?</p>

<p>Hrant, I have a problem with this. I recall you posting this opinion here before, that it is okay to ignore an author/creator&rsquo;s copyright if the author/creator is unreasonable.</p>
<p>My problem is that &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; is too relative. Just because you, or anyone else deems a person &ldquo;unreasonable,&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t automatically make them so. There are many computer users who think that all protection for fonts are unreasonable. Who is to sit judgement of the question of what is reasonable for all cases, and what is not?</p>
<p>There may be designers who find your protection clauses unreasonable. How would you feel if Patria got out, and innumeral derivations of its design, some under other names attributed to other designers, began to circulate? I doubt that you would find it reasonable when others made cash from your efforts.</p>
<p>That is the problem with terms like &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;mental&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Either we are going to respect coppyright and EULAs or we aren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not saying that there shouldn&rsquo;t be dialog within (and outside of) the community about what EULA terms should be. But to say that EULAs which are &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; may be ignored will lead to big problems.</p>
<p>If users find an EULA unreasonable, they should license type from someone else. Our field is not without competition, or change due to market circumstances. Those with unpopular EULAs will eventually get the message if their licensing numbers drop off drastically.</p>

<p>And everyone driving a car is supposed to not exceed the speed limit even by one mile-per-hour. But the cops will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never<!-- raw HTML omitted --> give you a ticket for that, and a court will throw out such a case. So the reality remains that it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unreasonable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to expect full de facto adherence to the letter of the law. It&rsquo;s all psychology, not a box.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a difference between the letter -or even the spirit- of the law, and how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->humans<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are really expected to behave. This discrepancy is natural considering that the law is designed to protect those [already] in power. Please, no hogwash about the law being intended to serve the People.</p>
<p>Human beings are not modules in a computer program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“unreasonable” is too relative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is &ldquo;too&rdquo; relative. We have to live with that, quite literally! Every moment of every day we make entirely subjective and personal decisions. This is just another one of them, no matter how much the lawdogs try to intimidate us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How would you feel if Patria got out, and innumeral derivations of its design,

</blockquote>
<p>I have never advocated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->redistributing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fonts, modified or otherwise. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is beyond reasonability; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->internal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> modification is not. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->attempt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at preventing internal modification is a scare tactic that can only backfire on the font house itself, because the main thing it does is place an unreasonable demand on the user, leading to a near-automatic violation of the clause, creating a precedent of de jure &ldquo;misbehavior&rdquo; in the user, in turn making him more comfortable carrying out further (less justifiable) violations. It&rsquo;s bad for everybody, no matter how attractive draconian modernism is (to some people).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either we are going to respect coppyright and EULAs or we aren’t.</p>

<p>Nope, I&rsquo;m shades of gray, not black or white. You do what you think is right, I do what I think is right. I&rsquo;m sorry if that&rsquo;s Bad For Business.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone objects to what you&rsquo;re calling &ldquo;internal modification,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t think this is what&rsquo;s being discussed here. Certainly anyone who buys a font to use on a book cover or a CD is welcome to have at the font with hammer and tongs; I&rsquo;ve certainly seen my fonts adapted in any number of ways, some of them OK, some of them brilliant, and some of them not so brilliant. That&rsquo;s the bell curve for you.</p>
<p>The issue is &ldquo;redistribution,&rdquo; as you put it. The clients who call us beginning with &ldquo;we love Minion, but&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; as described in the first post in this thread &ndash; are the ones who want to populate a large design system with &ldquo;customized&rdquo; fonts. In my experience, these include everything from fonts with a few serifs snipped off, to fonts whose only change is the font name and the copyright legend. This is not OK, and it&rsquo;s not a question of relativism or personal morals: it is against the law.</p>
<p>In the seventeen years I&rsquo;ve worked in this industry, it has been my consistent experience that organizations understand this without the need for legal intervention. Anyone interested in customizing their typography is serious about branding, and anyone serious about branding has legal counsel familiar with intellectual property law.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>According to Tiffany&rsquo;s chart (Type Foundry EULAs: who allows what), most foundries allow modifications.</p>
<p><a href="http://fontlab.wikidev.net/The_Case_for_a_User-Friendly_EULA">http://fontlab.wikidev.net/The_Case_for_a_User-Friendly_EULA</a></p>
<p>The concomitant stipulation is that any modified font can only be installed on a device which is licensed for the original. So the client commissioning the modification pays for licensing the original font, and the modification fee. This is reasonable, because the modification fee is paying for their exclusive custom version of the font.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this kind of work done on my fonts, and I&rsquo;ve done it on fonts designed by others: for instance, for newspapers, headline or agate versions of &ldquo;standard&rdquo; fonts. My client could have contacted the original foundry, but was confident in my ability to do the work adequately, on time, and reasonably priced. No doubt the original foundry could have done it just as well, or better, but for my client they are an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>However, I would never mess with the beziers of a font from Font Bureau, or any other foundry that prohibits it in their EULA. They are not being unreasonable, merely setting the terms of a contract which potential users can take or leave, and other font workers are legally bound to observe, no matter what they think of it. It&rsquo;s not just a question of obeying the law, but of mutual respect amongst designers.</p>
<p>There is a difference between civil disobedience such as speeding (citizen vs. state) and disrespecting the Bureau (citizen vs. citizen), which is a small design firm, not exactly what you&rsquo;d call &ldquo;those in power&rdquo;, Hrant.</p>

<p>Hrant,
I got pulled over for going less 2 mph over the limit. I only got a warning, but he seemed close to giving me a real ticket.</p>
<p>Laws (especially regarding traffic) are made&hellip; to be broken. The speed limit is 40 because they know people will be driving 45. There is a certain buffer around many American laws with acceptable overages and underages.</p>
<p>However, with contracts and EULA type things there are specific borders that you have to adhere to. They are generally very direct in stating your rights and limitations, and there isn&rsquo;t room for personal interoperation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess you haven&rsquo;t been looking at EULAs lately. I was guilty of the same some years ago; but I&rsquo;m not into EULAs. On the other hand, as Tiffany might tell you, there has been a return to more reasonability lately, probably partly because of the bursts of public outrage such as this. But there are still too many font houses that have that clause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it’s not a question of relativism or personal morals: it is against the law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone interested in customizing their typography is serious
about branding, and anyone serious about branding has legal
counsel familiar with intellectual property law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is &ldquo;serious&rdquo;? If it&rsquo;s the ability to make money, I don&rsquo;t think your argument holds water, since companies richer than the ones you would consider &ldquo;serious&rdquo; do that all the time. And if it&rsquo;s not about money, then is it about typographic integrity? That&rsquo;s also problematic, because of the cultural deficiencies in the concept of intellectual property, especially in something as inherently derivative as type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mutual respect amongst designers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work either, obviously. Not least because some font houses -who do prohibit any modification- deservedly don&rsquo;t get any respect from other designers.</p>
<p>The only thing that ever works is Reasonability. And that clause isn&rsquo;t. Which is why it does more harm than good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not exactly what you’d call “those in power”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of the type world, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of course<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there are some entities which have more power than others, for various reasons. If you had sat in Lawrence&rsquo;s EULA meeting at TC2004, you would have recognized them by the hissy fits they were throwing. You of all people should see that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he seemed close to giving me a real ticket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s trained to make you think. Where do you think all the money goes - donuts?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speed limit is 40 because they know people will be driving 45.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly! And EULAs have the no-mod clause to scare a small segment of users into following it; these are equivalent to the few people on the road who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> always drive under the speed limit. And it&rsquo;s notable that these people are usually too old or they&rsquo;re illegal aliens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with contracts and EULA type things there are specific borders that you have to adhere to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and this absolutism is what makes it not work. Traffic laws are pragmatically constructed (even though they&rsquo;re made to control peons). But such a clause is a EULA is either broken or not; and when -not if- it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> broken, you&rsquo;ve broken your best chance at getting cooperation from the user. We need our users more than they need us; let&rsquo;s not push them to piracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there isn’t room for personal interoperation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But humans personal-interpret <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everything, all of the time!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
They are not cogs.</p>

<p>You are the one excusing piracy, with your &ldquo;I hit her because she&rsquo;s ugly&rdquo; logic. Manufactured provocation is a self-serving excuse for illegal or bad behavior.</p>
<hr>
<p>I can think of at least two perfectly reasonable arguments for a no-mod clause:</p>
<ol>
<li>To nip in the bud the process of companies doctoring a font, renaming it, and skipping multi-user license fees.</li>
<li>Because a foundry doesn&rsquo;t want to see visually corrupted versions of their fonts in the media, degrading their reputation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having said that, I don&rsquo;t believe that foundries are obligated to explain why they make their EULAs the way they are, in order to justify users not breaking the agreement.</p>
<p>If users find a particular foundry&rsquo;s licence agreement onerous, they should get their fonts from a different foundry.</p>
<p>The solution is a purchaser better informed about the options in the marketplace, not a piracy exemption for ignorance, as you are suggesting.</p>

<p>There seems to be some misunderstanding about the way the font business works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s organized around licence agreements, which are a form of legal contract. Not a perfect system, but it&rsquo;s what we have.</p>
<p>The person, or company, who writes a licence agreement can put any conditions they like in it. For instance, they could decide that licensees only be allowed to use the font if they&rsquo;re wearing a paper hat. You might think that&rsquo;s unreasonable, but if those are the terms of the agreement, and you don&rsquo;t agree, you should licence your fonts from a different foundry.</p>
<p>Hrant, Gerald, you seem to believe that users should be free to disregard whatever terms of a contract they consider unreasonable. That&rsquo;s a slippery slope. The system is un-policed as it is (which does little to discourage abuse) so behavior is determined by social contract. Yes, people cheat, but at least let&rsquo;s try and keep up appearances and not legitimize it, otherwise minority vices become mass habits.</p>
<p>I agree with you that being allowed to modify the fonts which one has licensed is a good idea, which is why I permit it in my EULA, as do many other foundries. However, there are those who don&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s their prerogative.</p>

<p>While I think reasonable human behavior makes civilized life possible. Formal laws are an aspect of that, but so are things like compassion, sincerity, candor, etc. that I&rsquo;m sure you were told were Good Things while you were growing up too. So it&rsquo;s a balance, and a pragmatic, nebulous, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->human<!-- raw HTML omitted --> balance. The over-reliance on formal law benefits those in power; it is designed to keep us peons. And this overt formalism is perhaps the single greatest flaw of western culture. It is inhuman. And pretending that we expect people to follow an unreasonable clause in a EULA is counter to how I was personally brought up. And if you ignore that society is made up of individuals with different desires/needs, you trade in Culture for Capital.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While I&rsquo;m not a professional type designer, this debate to me seems to be very similar to the war that is currently being waged in the music industry.</p>
<p>Metallica stood up and decided that Napster and other file sharing programs were illegal and stole profits from the artist and the music industry. What this did was ruin a huge potential (and might I add &ldquo;free&rdquo; marketing tool) to be utilized by both artists and record companies. Many of us who downloaded songs for free had the full intention of making actual music purchases. Song downloads could have been seen as &ldquo;samples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Metallica &ldquo;banned&rdquo; myself and many others from Napster, (their songs I downloaded to see whether I was going to purchase their back catalogue of albums) I vowed never to purchase ANYTHING by Metallica as long as I live, and I still haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Artists that are on major labels are getting raped by record companies because they&rsquo;re stealing money from artists that they attribute to loss by illegal downloading. Consumers on the other hand (now I believe more than ever) pirate music as a backlash against record companies for putting out crap music and/or charging too much for it. Record companies are still losing money&hellip;</p>
<p>Moral of the story: &ldquo;dogma can destroy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming from &ldquo;let&rsquo;s keep up appearances&rdquo;, yeah, right. Who is being more convenient? We both make and sell fonts. And you probably <!-- raw HTML omitted -->use<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fonts more than me; I really don&rsquo;t use fonts very much, so you can keep your &ldquo;piracy&rdquo;/&ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; propaganda to yourself. You&rsquo;re siding 100% with the font house position, I&rsquo;m trying to strike a balance, to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Terry, good point.

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like the issue of font modification in the music business.
Except perhaps the use of songs in commercials.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can&rsquo;t really compare the font business to the music business, because there is no mass consumer market for fonts, thanks to bundling.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s disingenuous. People pirate music because they are greedy and they won&rsquo;t get caught. The &ldquo;anti-establishment&rdquo; rationale is a gloss.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a forum for differing viewpoints and points of view? Anywho, I completely disagree with that. While that may be true in some cases, I think &ldquo;people are greedy and they won&rsquo;t get caught&rdquo; is also a gloss. While I&rsquo;m guilty of this as well, its best not to speak in broad generalizations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not claiming to be anti-establishment. All I offered was food for thought.</p>
<p>While I agree the profits that stand to be gained from fonts and music is definitely astronomically different, my comparison was based more on a consumer perspective.</p>
<p>We designers often forget about regular consumers and that&rsquo;s something that should certainly not be underestimated. Like it or not, there is nothing that&rsquo;s going stop regular Joe&rsquo;s from thinking that fonts cost too darn much.</p>
<p>On the otherhand&hellip;Nick has a point in that if you don&rsquo;t like the rules, when you make your own fonts, tailor them specifically to what you think is reasonable. I don&rsquo;t really see why there&rsquo;s so much bickering.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And Nick, the smaller you are (and you and I are both small) the more it&rsquo;s plain dumb to blindly bend over for the system. Speaking of plain dumb, pragmatically, in the end it&rsquo;s plain dumb to put a no-mods clause in a EULA. If your hubris or confusion about human nature cause you to be plain dumb*, hey, the most -and least- others should do is feel sorry; but just know that you&rsquo;re the one who will suffer most for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nevermind that you totally ignore the question of why you don&rsquo;t have such a clause while some other houses do. Certainly the products and clientele aren&rsquo;t always totally different. Is it too much to think about? Or perhaps the results of your thoughts would put a hole right through your formal legal absolutist facade&hellip; People can sense what not to think about - it&rsquo;s called a coping mechanism. Some of us are lousy at that though; we feel dirty about looking the other way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most tellingly, let&rsquo;s try to figure out why font houses have gone back and forth about putting such a clause, while their product and clientele hasn&rsquo;t changed. When were they right, when were they wrong? Oh, I forgot, A Business Is Never Wrong - it&rsquo;s always the customer&rsquo;s fault (since his lawyers are worse). What&rsquo;s histerical of course is that this goes against a central tenet of Capitalism: The Customer Is Always Right. In the end, it&rsquo;s neither. The truth is, The Customer Is Always Duped, And Made To Never Even Realize It.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let&rsquo;s get back on topic.</p>
<p>Here is (as I see it) reason number one for foundries have no-mod clauses in EULAs:</p>
<p>It has to do with branding. Not the foundry&rsquo;s branding, but what people tend to do with brands. Like was said above, a modified font-x looks like font-x with a funny nose, but big companies want that anyway.</p>
<p>So big company goes to a designer (or to a branding agency, who then goes to a type designer). They say, we want to license font-x from foundry-y. We are going to buy a 10,000 seat license. Since foundry-y allows font modifications, we want to pay you to modify font-x so that it represents our new &ldquo;branding goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the designer, or branding agency and designer, are making a lot of extra modification money. Most type designers/foundries would prefer to do that modification themselves, and get that money instead of letting it go to a third-party. Sure, they are still getting the licensing fees, but they want to control all money made with their products.</p>
<p>Since this is in large part about money, I&rsquo;m sure that any foundry with a no-mod clause would, for an extra licensing fee, sell a modification license to the licensee. If you want to modify font-x, but foundry-y doesn&rsquo;t allow it in their EULA, you can get a EULA upgrade for a fee.</p>
<p>Or you can go to foundry-z, and license font-w. Foundry-z has a different EULA. That is the way our market works. Some people would rather criticize the market in general than talking about real solutions.</p>

<p>Dan Reynolds' assessment is a good one; let me continue the story. Big Company, having contacted Foundry Y, finds that Foundry Y is indeed interested in doing the customization of their fonts. However, having only a vague understanding of intellectual property law &ndash; doubtless informed by reading unmoderated posts on Typophile &ndash; they turn to Some Dude X to inquire about having a cheap imitation made. This is where your relativism leads, Hrant: Big Company gets to cheap out, at the expense of the fine people of Foundry Y.</p>
<p>Similar to Foundry Y is a small outfit called Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones. Unlike the sinister corporations that terrorize Hrant&rsquo;s bizarro universe, we are not entirely cruel and avaricious, and we try not to spend more than 20% of the day thinking up new ways to screw people (except orphans &ndash; we hate orphans.) What we are is a five person company specializing in the development of new typefaces, and our biggest thrill of the year will be scraping together enough cash to give another typeface designer a full-time job. We work our asses off, Hrant, and I&rsquo;ll thank you to remember that next time you generalize about &ldquo;font houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the philosophical chops to get into a lofty discussion about capitalism, let alone &ldquo;destroying humanity&rdquo; or &ldquo;keeping people peons.&rdquo; (These items rarely come up in our weekly meetings.) I&rsquo;m just happy to have a business that allows me to invest my resources wholly in design, and I&rsquo;m really grateful to the people who make this possible by buying our fonts, EULA and all. We don&rsquo;t find it especially hard to treat people respectably, and we do our best to accommodate their wishes, but sometimes we do have to tell people that they can&rsquo;t just change the lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo; in Gotham and call it their own. So be it. It&rsquo;s a small price to pay for being able to keep drawing typefaces.</p>

<p>and i&rsquo;m not talking about EULA, Shmula, Momo or Mula ,  but about DIGNITY, the ability to go to work with an AIM,  GOAL;  that you&rsquo;re/we doing something &ndash; Designing Typefaces.</p>
<p>and then &ndash; when we/you  are going to TypeCon you have the Dignity to stand in front of other people and educate them about your work!!!</p>

<p>If &ldquo;making good fonts is not enough,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m really not sure what you expect of people who make fonts. I try to comport myself honorably, which for me means not publishing ripoffs of other people&rsquo;s designs (no matter how much I&rsquo;d love to digitize half of ATF&rsquo;s back catalog), not cutting corners in my work (even if I know nobody&rsquo;s ever going to use the &lsquo;stfj&rsquo; ligature in Requiem Italic), and providing jobs for as many other type designers as I can. I also support public radio and the ASPCA, and I generally remember to recycle tin foil.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Actually, Erik Spiekermann, David Berlow, and Jean-François Porchez all participate relatively often on Typophile. As do Thomas Phinney, Mark Simonson, and John Hudson… in addition to quite a few other professional type designers. In short, it all comes down to time and ability, Parker. All of the designers whose names you mentioned do attend design conferences, though. So I wouldn&rsquo;t say that they are unapproachable.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think that the type designers who don&rsquo;t participate on Typophile should be criticized for not doing so. If the forums become interesting and relevant enough, I suspect that more might show up. I also don&rsquo;t see how anyone can fault type designers for designing fonts…</p>

greetings everyone. i just started designing a display font for my typography class. it&rsquo;s based on my handwriting (thought it might be nice to have for a personal identification package) and it is comprised of just capital letters.</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a name for it yet nor have i designed all the letters. but, i just wanted to see if anyone had some feedback for me. thanks a lot!</p>
<p>-k&quot;</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re  still looking for feedback</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also don’t see how anyone can fault type designers for designing fonts…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan &ndash; what do you mean?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I hink modding a font is like remixing a song. If it&rsquo;s done well, it can really re-invent the whole song, give it a new groove, make it fresh. A lot of typeface history, I think, is about such remixes. There is very little of actually coming up with a completely new design and a lot of tweaking, modding, remixing, solve et coagula done. FF Bau and GalaxiePolaris are, imo, Remixes of Helvetica, whichinteself remixes different influences and templates. It&rsquo;s an ongoing cultural evolutionary process and as such it is not a bad one. We have the same stuff in music. The Dandy Warhols and/or The Hives are remixes of The Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Now, Mick and the gang could either be pissed at the fact that someone is «stealings their style or take it as a compliment or at least a inherent element of any artistic field.</p>
<p>Even when it comes down to remixing a font I bought for my own uses or for a client, I think that is fairly okay. Binary designs are moldable and should be treated as such. If I need a Franklin Gothic with a differnt design in the «Umlaute» (ÄÖÜ) for a job, I&rsquo;ll go ahead and do it in FontLab (IF I have the time :-). If I need a Font with real Small Caps and OSFs, I&rsquo;ll try to find a way to get it done myself or from a font service provider. I think this is a smaller scale than coming up wih a whole new font and in the most cases it&rsquo;s just following the acute demands of a certain job. &lt;</p>
<p>I still think some ogf Alex Branczyks remixes of comercial fonts such as OCR or Syntax were a lot of fun and I actually like his Syntax (used for the Philip Morris design shop catalogue by moniteurs, IIRC) a lot better than the new Syntax released by Linotype, merging the somewhat clumsier old Syntax with clean and neat OSFs. Same goes for Luc(as) Remix of Futura or Volkswagen. I don&rsquo;t know about the erspective of the guy whose fonts GET remixed, and I think credit (and  licenses bought beforehand) are due as a remix does not really give us an entirely NEW song or font (well, sometimes, but mostly not), but from the perspective of the end-user, I like font modding a lot :-D.</p>

<p>i don’t think this is fair to ask just Jonathan</p>

<ol>
<li>I do ask others. But I&rsquo;ve never wanted to make it some sort of campaign.</li>
<li>Some others -including some probably busier than Jonathan- in fact <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> participate. Not much, but more than once in a blue moon. Looking at your list I&rsquo;d include Carter, JFP, Spiekermann and Tankard (although not all on Typophile). Heck, even Berlow the Quiet :-) chimes in more.</li>
<li>When they do participate, it&rsquo;s not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exclusively<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to promote/protect their business. It would be nice to get more discourse about the craft. Or even just font jokes.</li>
<li>Jonathan was one of the founders of Typophile.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t enjoy pointing the finger at individuals - it tends to distract from the bigger problems. But in the context of this thread I think it&rsquo;s relevant to point out that not participating and insisting on servile respect for one&rsquo;s EULA are related.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really didn’t understand the Bacon quote at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess it means &ldquo;give back&rdquo;. Honorable behavior is great, and I think you manage better than most. But then there is graciousness, selflessness. And the craft can benefit from more of that, from everybody.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>let’s get back on topic &hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were to give one reason why Jonathan&rsquo;s and Nick&rsquo;s attitude is too draconian, it&rsquo;s that type design is never done in a vacuum. We owe a lot to precedent. The Law is not sensitive to this, and a EULA can take undue advantage of that. Trying to force a company to come exclusively to you for a mod on your humanist sans is indecent.</p>
<p>This should be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->especially<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pertinent to people like Jonathan who rely so heavily on revivalism. It seems to me that the criterion for good behavior among some people is in fact equivalent to not getting sued, to playing the games of the letter of the law. This shuts out the world of moral behavior, and that&rsquo;s inhuman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a Baskerville revival. But the fact that JB can&rsquo;t sue me does not reduce my unease, an unease that comes from issues relating to craft, not lawyers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s an ongoing cultural evolutionary process and as such it is not a bad one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly.
The trick is striking a balance between that and the practical needs ot designers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, NOTHING is ever done in a vacuum, nor is anything done that doesn&rsquo;t depend on something that came before. So freaking what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a basic problem with dime-store revolutionaries like yourself: they&rsquo;re hypocrites. Let me give you an example from my own life: I have a sister-in-law who is a self-professed 70s anti-establishment radical. She attended medical school and became a practicing physician but, somewhere along the way, she decided that working for a living sucked big time. So, she undertook some research and found a wondrous malady: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. No known cause, no known cure. So, she got herself diagnosed with this particular malady, and has been (thanks to well-thought-out insurance) on medical disability for the past ten years. She doesn&rsquo;t have the energy to work, but somehow she manages the energy for at least a month-long vacation to Europe or Africa or the Near East every year. And she gets paid rather well for NOT working in between her sojourns abroad.</p>
<p>She, like you, despises THE MAN, and she seems convinced and vindicated that she has come up with a perfect scam to screw THE MAN. But, guess what: THE MAN covers his posterior very well; when excessive claims cut into THE MAN&rsquo;s bottom line, he simply raises the rates that EVERYONE else pays. So, THE MAN makes his money no matter what, and EVERYONE ELSE gets screwed. Somehow or another, my sister-in-law fails to see it this way and, evidently, you don&rsquo;t get this very simple fact, either.</p>
<p>So, please, spare us your flaming rhetoric. The fact that you are the most prolific poster on this website indicates to me that you have WAY too much time on your hands. Rather than pontificating on these premises, why don&rsquo;t you use some of that free time to go out and actually DO something to make the world a better place? And do it in a way that IS socially responsible to the rest of us&hellip;people who are &ldquo;too smart&rdquo; to play by the rules end up costing the rest of us dearly.</p>

<li>I don&rsquo;t care about your sister-in-law. I barely care about you, and only to the extent of your relevance to type design. And you shouldn&rsquo;t care much about me, or worry about my flaws. Worry about yourself.</li>
<li>For every middle-aged anglo male who doesn&rsquo;t like me, there&rsquo;s somebody who isn&rsquo;t who does. Know this.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m Armenian. We have bigger problems than milking the last dimes out of corporations, and I very much am involved in trying to solve them. One way is by formulating ideas, giving talks, writing articles and making fonts that address the ills of Latinization in Armenian type design. What have you done for your script/culture? Don&rsquo;t answer, it&rsquo;s a rhetorical question - it&rsquo;s meant for you to answer to yourself, and think about.</li>
<li>No matter how you or I use our time, it remains that your stance, which is a central part of your culture, is making the world a worse place.</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;a founder of Typophile.&rdquo; This is Jared &amp; Joe&rsquo;s ballgame; I&rsquo;m just an occasional reader. I lent a small cup of content for the initial release (which is perhaps what you meant by &ldquo;giving back&rdquo;), and I was delighted to contribute the Mercury and Gotham fonts that are used in the current Typophile identity. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely mean-spirited to say that I participate here &ldquo;exclusively to promote or protect my business.&rdquo; (If you&rsquo;d like more professionals to be engaged in Typophile, perhaps you should be a little less inexplicably antagonistic toward the profession.) I avoid most discussions precisely because I think I&rsquo;d have obvious and self-serving things to say, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone reading the &ldquo;Quintessential American Font&rdquo; topic especially needs to hear my thoughts about Gotham or Knockout. I posted earlier that I try to join the conversation only when I&rsquo;ve got something to say, and the font business happens to be something that I have a lot to say about. So what&rsquo;s your problem? You seem content to lambast me for either participation or absenteeism, which is incomprehensible. (If you&rsquo;re just looking for someone to spar with, I&rsquo;m really not interested.) At any rate, since I&rsquo;m apparently going to be criticized whether I stay or go, I think I&rsquo;ll go. It&rsquo;s a shame, because it took me twenty minutes to make my icon.</p>

<p>That convenient escapism has already been put to the test on the ground on Typo-L, and has failed the test. Most &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t post wouldn&rsquo;t post no matter what; they simply use me as a convenient excuse. This isn&rsquo;t conjecture, the evidence is there.</p>
<p>But since I&rsquo;m not a bully, and want to show that I&rsquo;m not, and since I believe that a healthy forum is good for the craft, me, and everybody else, that old offer still stands:
<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/4694.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/4694.html</a></p>
<p>So no more excuses. I am not the problem. At most, I am the messenger. And judging by what happened on Typo-L (nothing) I&rsquo;m not even that. Demonize individuals, and you will be a textbook peon - you will dig yourself deeper in your trench.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s extremely mean-spirited to say that I participate
here “exclusively to promote or protect my business.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s candid. I&rsquo;m not a mean person, I just have different standards of behavior. Appreciate the difference, and mind the content instead of being eager to feel insulted. And my intent is not to make you look bad (I actually value you quite a bit) but to give you a view from the outside, and maybe, just maybe help you improve yourself, and as a result improve the craft, and me. And I&rsquo;m open to the same from you, and anybody else. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve tolerated being called a &ldquo;troll&rdquo;, &ldquo;parasite&rdquo;, etc. and have even endured a defamation campaign or two - without running away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I avoid most discussions precisely because I think
I’d have obvious and self-serving things to say</p>
</blockquote>
<p>?
Please, please, talk self-servingly about craft, instead of only about the law! We can handle it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m apparently going to be criticized whether I stay or go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not where you are, but what you are trying to be.
You are a lot already, but don&rsquo;t hate me if I push you to be more.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll even go the extra mile for you (plural):
When Tina starts that new thread asking Jonathan her direct questions, I won&rsquo;t make a single post to it. Now, if Jonathan doesn&rsquo;t make a post to it, that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s a bad person; but it does make me not the problem. And forget me anyway. Just improve your own behavior.</p>

<p>Ideas about copyright and intellectual properrty were introduced into law from a sense of fair play towards content producers. For visual images, this goes back to Hogarth&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; series of etchings. The rage of the day, it was set to music, used as decorations for fans and teacups, and so on; yet Hogarth lost much of the benefit of this popularity because of a flood of pirated copies of his prints issued by Grub Street booksellers. He and his friends petitioned Parliament to correct this abuse, and in 1735 an Act was passed vesting in designers and engravers an exclusive right to their own works, and restraining the multiplication of copies without their consent.</p>
<p>The principle is that the creator of a work has the right to derive the major benefit from it, not the copyist or plagiarist.</p>
<p>It is this principle which must be weighed against the right of buyers to do as they please with their purchases. For font software, license agreements define the relative rights of the two parties</p>

<p>One aspect of the topic is the necessarily derivative nature of any type design*, and the conflict this causes between morals and the law. You haven&rsquo;t addressed that, and it&rsquo;s a central question. It takes two to engage in a pissing match, after all.</p>

<p>Here was the real question, which I&rsquo;ve just reread:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->let’s say I’m the client and I really love Minion — so what the type designer is going to do? “copy” the font? change the strokes? create a new Minion?…….<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If you are the type designer in this case you say: &ldquo;If you really love Minion, that is great! Minion is a sweet font that Robert Slimbach at Adobe designed. Go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type">http://www.adobe.com/type</a> and license one copy of the font for each of your workstations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the client says, &ldquo;I want my own similar-Minion,&rdquo; see the above discussion. If Adobe allows modifications, the client still needs to license all of the necessary copies before the type designer could do any changes. If Adobe doesn&rsquo;t allow modifications, the designer should recommend another font from another foundry.</p>
<p>If the client says, &ldquo;yeah, but I just want you to design me a typeface that looks just like Minion, because you are cheaper than Adobe,&rdquo; then the type designer should walk away. What goes around, comes around…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan, you were steering this thread in the right direction with your earlier post&hellip; this is very much about money.  That should be out in the middle of the table right now — a giant centerpiece of fragrant banknotes.</p>
<p>EULAs are about money, not usage or modification.  We all want to make a buck doing this stuff.  That&rsquo;s why no-mod clauses are drafted: to protect fiscal (as well as creative) interests.  That&rsquo;s also why Hrant wants to argue these prohibitions away&hellip; to exercise this Objectivist greed without remorse, reprimand or justification.  While I am certain that Hrant&rsquo;s argument strikes a chord in all our greedy hearts, it seems he speaks the &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; logic that pressed the capitalist bootprint into his forehead.  Greed is good, but not good at justifying its goodness with words.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad Hrant has the ballz to spit fury.  If he&rsquo;s not entertaining, he&rsquo;s speaking from the depths of his psyche (even the insults).</p>
<p>Civil disobedience was mentioned.  Complete lunacy.  No lives are being taken in the font industry; just livelihoods.  Ethically, if you must prepare your closing arguments before committing the offence, you should perhaps petition to change the law before breaking it.  The least you nay-sayers could do is license from another distributor/foundry that caters to your philosophy, as Nick has valiantly been restating, rather than rail against the efforts of our contemporaries, however adverse you may be to them.</p>
<p>So what of respect?  What about respecting/protecting creative and fiscal interests?  What about reasonable compensation for services provided?  Are we all to go it alone&hellip; dog eat dog ripping off each other&rsquo;s software as we commiserate in forums about the lack of money to be made in type design?</p>
<p>And terminology aside, I think we can all agree that a thief and a pirate are equal.  Let&rsquo;s not split hairs about taking money in breach of EULA clauses.</p>

<p>99% of the time, if a designer makes a logo or masthead by setting the text in Illustrator or Photoshop, and then converts the image to paths or pixels, and then changes the letters that way, it is fair use*, because it does not change the font data. Some type designers get peeved by this, but it is permitted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless of course, it was written in the EULA that you could NOT do that. I know of no EULAs that do just that. A few foundries (just two or three small ones, I think) may not allow you to set entirely typographic logos with their fonts, without a special license

<p>Silas, I&rsquo;ll resist the urge to pick apart the many elements of your arguments that I disagree with, but I will [re]state this: I am in fact trying to strike a balance. Otherwise I would advocate free-wheeling appropriation, like making direct derivatives of a design without the client buying a commensurate license of the original. That extreme and the other extreme (Thou Must Not Breathe Without My Express Written Permission) are ubiquitous, and easy cop-outs. While I&rsquo;m trying to tread the nebulous, slippery path of &ldquo;reasonability&rdquo;; because I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s most important. And anybody who thinks the letter of the law is more important has my pity.</p>
<p>So my problem is with the hypocrisy of being obsessively protective of things that don&rsquo;t really totally belong to us. Like Adobe getting a design patent on a Garamond. It&rsquo;s indecent. That to me over-rides the legal considerations.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant: I stand corrected.  Your arguments led me to believe things you did not explicitly state.</p>
<p>This is precicely the importance of having every intention set in stone - in a EULA - to avoid conflict of interpretation and to make one&rsquo;s position plain and simple.  If Jonathan doesn&rsquo;t want you to breathe without written consent, that&rsquo;s his perogative and with good reason&hellip; in order to limit the exponential degradation of his work and income.  He has a right to protect his published work and wallet.</p>
<p>Letter and spirit of the law is a balancing act, yes, but when the letter is as clear as prohibiting modification, what difference in spirit is there to deduce?  Go ahead and break the EULA.  Nobody has the money to sue you anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making broader strokes here, and in that motion I&rsquo;d like to spell out my stance&hellip;</p>
<p>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</p>
<p>If you mod a font in breach of EULA, you&rsquo;re working in a deficit of ethics and morality.  To attempt to justify a lack of respect in such behavior with popular opinion and superior reasoning, you&rsquo;re denying the EULA&rsquo;s author any attempt at conducting business in the manner he/she deems fit.</p>
<p>I still say there is hope for your logic though.  You just need to deliver a more inviting argument and not scare Nick with anti-American slander.  Knowing your intention, I would gladly allow you to craft a derivative of anything I have done so long as you shared the process and/or profit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still up in the air about this particular subject so it&rsquo;s good to see it in the forums.  It is one of the factors holding me back from my publishing debut.  (I focus on private commissions.)  I don&rsquo;t see any of the larger distributors protecting the designers as vigilantly as we can protect ourselves when it comes to aftermarket life of the software.  I&rsquo;m content in working closely with respectable clients that respect my services.  If everyone conducted themselves with such respect, we would perhaps have no need for EULAs at all.  Sadly, that&rsquo;s not the case, and you&rsquo;re trying to make it all seem so sane.  Do go on.</p>

<p>Type is a formal affair. A large part of human nature may think &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all derivative&rdquo;, but when one looks deeper, one finds that there are varying degrees of derivation, and some categories which are quite distinct. Your buddy John Downer explored some of these distinctions: <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EFoITrbF.php">http://www.emigre.com/EFoITrbF.php</a></p>
<p>There is a huge difference in quality between original work done from scratch (ie drawn with bezier tools, without the benefit of tracing scans) and fonts made by tweaking someone else&rsquo;s data.</p>

<p>BTW, Nick, please know that there are a lot of things about you -not to mention some of your fonts, like Panoptica- that I like. Like I remember you explaining the reasoning behind Oneleigh to me at ATypI-99, and my thinking highly of it. Maybe I&rsquo;m strange, but the fact that I think you are so wrong about so many important things doesn&rsquo;t sour things for me at all. Maybe because I think you are right about enough other things in type, or maybe more important things outside of type.</p>

But here you&rsquo;ve gone to far with the personal insults, and just plain rudeness. Oddly, however, in this instance I find myself agreeing with you on this point: no-mod clauses are no fun for anyone. &ldquo;No mod for resale&rdquo; clauses make more sense. At the same time the practice of &ldquo;mod to skinny out of buying licenses&rdquo; is no good either.</p>
<p>As for the idea of remix: It can be good or it can be cheap and lousy. There is also the concept of &ldquo;re-perform&rdquo;, which is better in my mind. It&rsquo;s one thing to sample someone&rsquo;s song and add very little. It&rsquo;s another thing to perform it and add your own touch. There&rsquo;s a fine line that must be drawn. No one likes cheap font cd&rsquo;s filled with cheap, slightly altered and renamed fonts. At the same time, I would love to see Jonathan interpret Frutiger or Zapf, just as he interprets the work of designers whose work has now entered the public domain. Maybe works need to enter the public domain much more quickly. What if all works became public domain after 10 years? It would make more sense to me. That being said, I may be reticent to release my fonts into the public domain when they turn 10 if they are still making me money :)</p>

<p>Christian, different things make each of us sad. You think this is some kind of cheery thread for me? But if we care about Typophile it&rsquo;s very important not to let the behavior of others dampen our participation. I value candor as much as you seem to value civility; but most of all I value tolerance, and not just of content, but of expressive style. What else could hope to work in such a heterogenous environment?</p>

<p>And how far does one have to tweak an existing design for it to be a respectable reinterpretation?  Who is to judge?  I&rsquo;d say the licensor/designer of the original has 51% say.  Even in the music industry, remixes require the approval of the original artist/publisher prior to release.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Matey, let me tell you my favorite tale from the high sees, one that will shiver the timbers of any salty rapscallion, arrr!</p>
<p>I had just finished what was then -and remained for 10 years- the typeface I had spent the most time on (about 800 hours). It was a serif Armenian font, a niche market then quite thirsty (but now no longer). I released it, sold a number, and was glad to see it used anywhere and everywhere. Most users had certainly not paid for it. But being the pragmatist, I could simply not get angry. Which isn&rsquo;t to say I don&rsquo;t like/need money - I&rsquo;m human too. In fact, the sales and commissions I made in the last quarter of that year financed my &ldquo;famed&rdquo; 6-month sojourn in Barcelona; I only left for LA -via Beirut- when I ran out of money (and missed my Armenian community too much). Anyway. What happened is one day I saw a CD cover with a sans version of my darling design! I tracked it down, and found out it was done by an old buddy of mine from back home!! Yes, I was a bit angry at that appropriation, but it subsided quickly, and required no action, even though the guy was about 15 minutes away from me. You know what peeved me the most? That he chopped off the serifs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but didn&rsquo;t alter the spacing&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> That&rsquo;s a strong aspect of the relationship I have -and I&rsquo;d like to keep as much as possible- with my work. Note that I didn&rsquo;t have a EULA. And THAT DIDN&rsquo;T MATTER ONE DIDDLY, not to him, not even to me! Now, I don&rsquo;t expect -or even want- everybody else to be like me, trust me. But I&rsquo;m not some alien. What I felt, and what I still feel, is an aspect of humanity, and like any aspect of humanity, it can&rsquo;t be conveniently ignored.</p>
<p>A more &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; anecdote along these lines:
Legend has it that when the barbarian hordes were pillaging Constantinople, a Byzantine noble sighed: &ldquo;If only they knew what they were destroying, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind one bit.&rdquo; To me, this is the sort of thing that elevates us above mere animals.</p>

<p>Your testimonial brings up another of my thoughts&hellip; thanks for the segue&hellip;</p>
<p>Had your friend been required (or politely asked) to at least contact you regarding derivatives in a EULA, you would have at least been able to advise him on the spacing issue.  You probably could have arranged a subsequent licensing arrangement for the derivative.  A better product would have been delivered and compensation could have been spread around.</p>
<p>Human or not, poor behavior is poor behavior as determined by environment.  A bull in a china shop is still going to destroy the goods.  The type biz environment is fragile and delicate, and a lot of items aren&rsquo;t packaged with enough foam peanuts and crumpled newspaper.  A no-mod clause is an attempt at padding against breakage, but then these items sit on the same shelves as your open-box wares.  The bull is ignorant of the packaging&hellip; he&rsquo;ll smash them both the same.</p>
<p>The balance of extremes which you are striving for will only be attainable if type designers and modders and users work in concert and in good faith&hellip; to tame those bulls or at least keep them in the pasture.  There must be a network of trust and respect and conditioning in business matters for your ideal market to emerge.  Naturally, communication and respect is the crux of this dreamland, and some animals will never learn the language.</p>
<p>What can be learned from the Open Source Initiative?  Has this been discussed at any conferences or forums with respect to font licensing?</p>

<p>With <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What EULA&rsquo;s stopping anyone&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I meant to say that no EULA will ever be able to stop anyone from opening a font and looking into it for fun or for education or whatever else. In fact, no law can stop anyone from doing something that isn&rsquo;t public or doesn&rsquo;t affect others. So the &ldquo;open for education&rdquo; argument doesn&rsquo;t really influence EULAs, mod, no-mod, or no-mod-for-profit.</p>
<p>Also, I wasn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stating<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that just because something has no victim it&rsquo;s right to do it. I just thought that since &ldquo;it hurts the type designer&rdquo; is so used to justify EULAs, it should be possible to use the opposite to justify not following them.

<p>Successful design is purposeful; everything is there for a reason.
Typefaces that are derived from others, either by tracing scans or re-using bezier paths (and metrics) lack purpose, because the re-worker is merely repeating shapes (like mouthing a foreign language phonetically) and has little concept of the underlying syntax and vocabulary, of why it looks the way it does, of what it means.</p>
<p>I admit that it is possible to perform a purposeful font-mod: that&rsquo;s what I did with headline and agate versions of DIN. But I really don&rsquo;t consider that to be type design &ndash; it&rsquo;s tinkering, a technical procedure: production artist, not designer.</p>

<p>There you go again, with the dismissive editorializing.
Forgive me for lecturing you, but it&rsquo;s not enough to cover yourself, when things occasionally get a little hot, by saying how much you like some aspects of your engagee&rsquo;s work (thanks for that anyway!), you have to trust in the logic of your argument, edit out the adjectives, and not insult them in the first place.</p>
<p>Yeah, your reaction is open and honest, but it is also, if not malicious, still hurtful and arrogant. A little more wit is required for a good insult, otherwise it&rsquo;s just bad manners.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about a principle which is central to my work as a designer/artist/whatever, and calling it &ldquo;laughable&rdquo; and &ldquo;cute for 5 minutes&rdquo;. Fortunately, I&rsquo;m pretty thick-skinned, otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t keep coming back for punishment.</p>

<p>Someone here adviced Hrant to go out and use his time to make a better world instead of wasting it on Typophile teaching others about the so-called human nature. I paraphrase, but it is of no real consequence.</p>
<p>Hrant already does that. It&rsquo;s not his fault if someone&rsquo;s blind.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sergej,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that your comment is constructive in the least. Hrant has told us already that, for every person who dislikes him, there are many more who love him; however, I don&rsquo;t dislike <!-- raw HTML omitted -->him<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, just his deplorable behavior. He gives as his excuse/justification that he&rsquo;s Armenian. Yes, throughout history Armenia has suffered some rather horrible treatment, but it&rsquo;s an issue he needs to take up with the Ottoman Turks or imperial Russians, if he can find any. I&rsquo;m not responsible, nor is anyone else here.</p>
<p>And, for all his tirades against the evils of Capitalism, let&rsquo;s be perfectly honest: were it not for the fruits of those evils, this forum would not exist. In the grand scheme of things, the subjects we deal with here are utterly superfluous. In order to communicate via the written word, anything more than one typeface with the appropriate language-specific character set is a luxury. Evil capitalism and its excesses also allowed me and several other foundries represented by myfonts.com to contribute tens of thousands of dollars to tsumani relief in the wake of the disaster than hit Southeast Asia late last year.</p>
<p>Hrant is obviously an intelligent person. His command of English is far better than a significant majority of native speakers whom I encountered on a daily basis, and neither myself nor most of the other participants in these hallowed halls, I am fairly confident, could locate a restroom, get directions, or make a phone call if we had to do it in Armenian. But it would be far more constructive–and pleasant–if, in all instances, he used his intelligence for the increase of knowledge, rather than sowing discord by railing about the world&rsquo;s ills and engaging in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ad hominem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attacks against other participants.</p>
<p>This forum is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->temenos<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a sacred circle where devotees of the typographic arts gather to learn and to share. Yes, evil and social injustice exist in the big, bad world out there, but it would be much more agreeable if those things stayed out there, if just for a little while.</p>

<p>Typefaces that are derived from others, either by tracing scans or re-using bezier paths (and metrics) lack purpose, because the re-worker is merely repeating shapes…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the hundreds of incarnations of Helvetica, Caslon and Garamond to name a few&hellip;.it seems pretty clear to me that there is much modification and interpretation that goes into type design. I don&rsquo;t know if this fair to type design or typographers to paint a visual with so broad a brush.</p>
<p>There are many professional type designers who re-interpret historical typography. Matthew Carter and Akira Kobayashi, I&rsquo;m sure would have a thing or two to say on the subject.</p>
<p>What seems to be an underlying problem in the &ldquo;ruffling of feathers&rdquo; on this particular thread is that no one has clearly defined the terms. Until there is one definitive term for the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; for example, can we all truly understand each individual&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>And BTW, as a side note&hellip;how is this thread not showing up on the &ldquo;hottest&rdquo; section on the homepage? This seems to be one of the most active threads on this site.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just wanted to say that I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying this thread by all participants, including Hrant. I do have one thing that I must interject though:</p>
<p>You are certainly not the sole minority on this site. I&rsquo;m sure there are others. I happen to be an African-American male who has interests in art (I&rsquo;m an illustraotr and painter), music (I write and listen to metal and punk music), I enjoy designing type, and I&rsquo;m a graphic designer. There are not many African-Americans involved in any of the fields of interest I choose. I often feel like a man alone on a quest as well. As a Black man in America I have dealt with many kinds of attrocities, social injustice, bigotry, and isolation. There are two things one can do when faced with these things 1) wear it on your sleeve or 2) accept as a part of who you are and what you&rsquo;ve become.</p>
<p>My point is&hellip;no one really cares about any of that about me. They&rsquo;ll care more about what type of person I am. While I think you&rsquo;ve brought up many interesting and GREAT points on this site, I perceive it is a cop out to bring up ethnicity into certain discussions. I&rsquo;m certainly not playing the race card here, and I don&rsquo;t think this discussion warrants it.</p>
<p>I commend your efforts and involvement in social activities, but it has forced others to justify what they do outside of the world of typography, which truly has nothing to do with this thread.</p>
<p>Please offer your opinions and advice. But name calling will never get your point across. I wish you good luck in all your endeavors.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>How about starting a whole new forum on Typophile for philosophy?  This thread is rendering some tasty bits on some topics I&rsquo;d love to hear and learn more of.  With the direction this thread has taken, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe that we cannot fully separate politics (or personality) from what we all come here to discuss.  It could be nothing but beneficial to have a tertiary arena to let it all out.</p>
<p>Not to get mushy, but we have a real opportunity to meet minds across so many differing backgrounds and experiences.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paul, sorry if you took my mantra the wrong way.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think it was a targeted insult along the lines of the Hrantistic &ldquo;if you say that people will think you&rsquo;re stupid&rdquo; or &ldquo;your theory is laughably over-simplistic&rdquo;, and no counter-argument.</p>
<p>Terry has asked for a clarity of definition for &ldquo;modification&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been trying to do all along.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t dissing revivals per se, or the people who do them (which would include myself anyway). I was talking about a certain kind of font modification (aka derivation) &ndash; one done by tracing scans or re-using bezier paths. When I said it lacked purpose, that was in the context of the phrase in the previous sentence, &ldquo;successful design is purposeful&rdquo;. I am making an argument, not an insult. The argument is that cleaning up someone else&rsquo;s design, or restyling it is not connected to a typeface design&rsquo;s underlying structure, its purpose, its reason to be. Polishing up someone else&rsquo;s design, or applying a veneer of style, is skilled work requiring a good typographic eye, but it is not design, and it is the disconnect from the original purpose of the design that makes it that way.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m repetitive is that I&rsquo;m responding to frequent statements from people saying there&rsquo;s no such thing as originality (&ldquo;creativity/originality&rdquo; thread) or that all typefaces are derivative (this thread). I find those kind of opinions demeaning to the practice of type design, and can&rsquo;t let them go unchallenged.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Returning to the topic: Reinterpretation of existing fonts is tied to changing technologies. Every new technology in typesetting has resulted in a flurry of sloppy reworkings of the typefaces available in the technology that was displaced. That&rsquo;s always been Fase One&hellip;</p>
<p>After a certain amount of time new typefaces would be developed, making use of the new possibilities of the new technology (eg the step from lead to photomech, then to cathode). That&rsquo;s what I would like to call Fase Two.</p>
<p>Due to the low treshold of &ldquo;building&rdquo; typefaces with PostScript (the current technology) we have seen a termendous increase in original and not so original typedesign. In principle a good thing, but&hellip; This low treshold has also resulted in a lot of rehashing of old typefaces. And that is a bad thing.
Why? First, because reusing old type means reintroducing past mistakes. In the old days typedesigners had a lot of restictions to consider &ndash; matrices with fixed widths or sets of widths, unit systems, etc. Compromises had to be make. And those show! Second, because &ldquo;staying&rdquo; with traditional type inhibits new developments. In my view new developments are needed to take type to the next plane: more legibility, more flexiblity, more individuality, more beauty, more&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that we should get out of Fase Two (and don&rsquo;t even mention Fase One). At present &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; typography is pretty awful. There are discussions on Typophile about what spacing (or none) should be around em-dashes. And so on. These should be unnecessary, given the possibilities of modern technology, IF these problems had been adressed by typedesigners and programmers.</p>
<p>I think, that&rsquo;s what should concern typedesigners, NOT some x-version of Baskerville. I would like to see typedesigners working on the &ldquo;Baskerville&rdquo; of our times.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, when I limit my argumentation with you it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve clearly stopped growing (and there&rsquo;s a shade of fascism in that). There&rsquo;s a point when one can cross over from expressing/defending one&rsquo;s views to simply wasting time and causing pointless aggravation - and I&rsquo;d like to avoid that. Maybe you didn&rsquo;t notice that I didn&rsquo;t react to your initial over-simple statement of What Isht Type Design; I only reacted to address a third party.</p>
<p>Speaking of the nature of type design, you and Jonathan are of course entirely too civilized to engage in a cogent (and in this case necessarily heated) debate about revivalism&hellip; You&rsquo;d much rather &ldquo;keep up appearances&rdquo; against the unwashed masses. And what is type design to me? At the highest level, it involves going beyond the surface of making pretty glyphs that look happy during deliberative observation, and making little machines that leverage notan to create good boumas; this is something you for one have yet to do. You are free to call this an insult; but what I feel I owe you -or maybe more accurately Typophile via you- more that Western civility is Human candor.</p>
<p>In short: stop whining - it&rsquo;s bad for appearances.
Show us instead your Easy Hollywood Diet for converting Eunoia to a text face. From that [attempt] we might [all] actually learn something.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>If that&rsquo;s what you think, you haven&rsquo;t been reading my posts. You stated that all typefaces are derivative &ndash; perhaps you would have notice my engagement if I had said I found that statement laughably over-simplified.

<p>That&rsquo;s a tough one. I don&rsquo;t like job descriptions.
Typographer is pretty general for people who work with type.
The important thing is to never describe someone who does a revival as the designer of that typeface. You could say they restored it, adapted it, or digitized it.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Hrant, PLEASE stop telling people what to do, eg &ldquo;Know This&hellip;&rdquo; in that bossy manner of yours, like you own Typophile because you&rsquo;ve got the most posts. And ha ha, yes we Anglos are always so concerned about keeping a stiff upper lip, and you&rsquo;re using anglo-speak as a sarcastic jibe.

Now you stop YOUR whining, you hear?!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many original glyphs must i design before i can make that leap?</p>

<p>No, you tell me.
I give up. I&rsquo;m converted.
Every typeface is a revival.
Anyone who works on a font is a type designer.
Anyone who buys a font can modify it if they want to, even if the EULA says they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now, on to the challenge.</p>

<p>My dear long-suffering, long-victimized, not-always-right-but-never-wrong, champion-of-the-underdog-and-the-horse-he-rode-in-on Armenian friend: Revivalists exist for the same reason that translators exist–they re-create, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with full homage and recognition of the original creators<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, something in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new<!-- raw HTML omitted --> context or medium which did not exist there before. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Iliad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Odyssey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were written in ancient Greek; the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aeineid<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Latin; the Bible in ancient Hebrew, Greek and; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Brothers Karamazov<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Russian, and so on and so on. The vast majority of readers of English (or ANY language other that the original) would never know the wonders and the powers of these works had not TRANSLATORS re-created the original works that new audiences could read and understand. So, to your way of thinking, are these men (and women) hacks and whores because they didn&rsquo;t create anything new?</p>
<p>Revivalists of old typefaces take works which formerly existed only as cast slugs of metal or sketches on a printed page and make them available to a world of digital users. The best (that is, the most ethical) of these revivalists fully credit the original creators; theirs is not a work of piracy, of mindless repetition and redundancy, but of love–a love of letterforms, and a wish to perpetuate the best of what came before by making it available to a wider audience. Forget what I said earlier about your being an intelligent person: if you cannot understand this simple, basic concept (Hrant hrules: utterly beside-the-point <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ad hominem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> arguments allowed), you are a moron.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost like nanotechnology! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p>Hrant, does achieving this preclude style or expression? Is there only one way to achieve it? Also, is there an empirical way to decide what a &ldquo;good bouma&rdquo; is? Do you have examples? I would think typographic context would be a qualifier in each example.</p>

<p>I guess I was lucky then, that when I started designing typefaces in my spare time, my day job was different, as an art director. The downside of that is that it takes a long time to get any good at it, or to do it in a way that is acceptable to &ldquo;industry standards&rdquo;, as one is self taught. The advantage that you have Paul is that you have a thorough professional grounding. Not all parts of type design depend on bezier wrangling, if you feel inclined to develop some original ideas, there&rsquo;s always good old-fashioned drawing and penwork.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the day from hell that I had at work on Friday, maybe it was the third Paulaner Salvator I had to help me forget that day, but this comment sounded like a shot to me.</p>
<p>Revivalists are NEVER given their sources complete: the concept of a complete ASCII character set didn&rsquo;t exist pre-ASCII, so inevitably some characters have to be divined and, in order to do this seamlessly, the revivalist needs at least some semblance of design sense.</p>
<p>Then, there are instances when the source documents are VERY incomplete: for example, the entire ASCIII character set for Picayune Intelligence BT was derived from just five letters (Riquet). Very little slavish copying and a WHOLE lot of designing was involved.</p>
<p>So, yes, I take Hrant&rsquo;s words as an insult (but&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s Armenian and can&rsquo;t help himself&hellip;is that written into the Armenian constitution?). Hrant may thinks that it&rsquo;s perfectly alright to belittle and dismiss whomsoever he chooses (all the while calling it merely &ldquo;speaking the truth&rdquo; or some other pious claptrap) in his endless quest for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alpha<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-male dominance of these forums, but I&rsquo;m pretty fed up with it.</p>

<p>Mmmmmm, Paulaner Salvator&hellip;. Anywho&hellip;I also thought he mentioned that he was in the process of reviving a face as well. Feelings are feelings and it may very well have been a crack. Honesty, candor and insult are certainly not the same things and I&rsquo;m sure a few people have yet to realize that.</p>
<p>Paul, Dan&hellip;I too understand. As a freelance designer by day, type is something I can only work on in my free time. Unfortunately, after using Quark Xpress and setting type for 8 hours a day I often don&rsquo;t feel like coming home and staring at a screen longer with FontLab and Illustrator.

<p>Yes, Paulaner Salvator: an excellent German double bock, although–truth be known–I greatly prefer Moretti La Rossa. However, this day Paulaner enjoyed the immense advantage of being on sale and, to honor the memory of my dear dead dad (cheap bastard that he was), I went with the Paulaner.</p>
<p>I know how difficult it is, after putting in your eight hours (more, usually, for me) at the day job, to come home and spent even more time in front of the monitor. So, add my vote to the paper-and-pencil advocates; at least that route allows you to exercise your lettersense muscles during the week, so you could tackle the monitor-and-mouse stuff on the weekends.</p>
<p>You said, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Honesty, candor and insult are certainly not the same things and I&rsquo;m sure a few people have yet to realize that.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Maybe some don&rsquo;t grasp the distinction, but I am well aware of the differences. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Candor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an absolute prerequisite for forums such as these: participants can and should express their opinions frankly and openly. However, opinions are opinions: personal observations of a particular subject by a particular person who has a particular personal history and a unique point-of-view; they are not irrefutable facts which can only be questioned by idiots, lackeys, peons or whatever the vituperation <!-- raw HTML omitted -->du jour<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is. To belittle, demean or dismiss any other participant in any way for not agreeing with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your<!-- raw HTML omitted --> opinion is an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->insult<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Are we crystal-clear so far?</p>
<p>Honesty is another problem entirely. I have stated this before, and I will state it again: the matters with which we concern ourselves in these forums are utterly superfluous in the Grand Scheme of Things. If all of the typefaces in the world (except one simple functional one) disappeared tomorrow, would humankind suffer irreversible damage the same way that it would if, say, food or sunlight disappeared tomorrow? No: the immense visual richness of written communication afforded by the typographic arts would be gone, and the fortunate few among us who actually make a living in the field would have to find other jobs, but life <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would<!-- raw HTML omitted --> go on. It is only because of the wretched excesses of our current economic system&ndash;where those who have, have too much and want more&ndash;that all here are afforded the luxury of discussing, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ad infinitem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it would seem, the subtleties, arcana and minutiae of the typemaking craft. That&rsquo;s the simple truth; that&rsquo;s honesty. Maybe too much honesty: suddenly I feel so unnecessary&hellip;</p>
<p>If those among us who rail against the evils of the current economic system were really serious, they would chuck civilization and its contentments, find a community somewhere in the world that hasn&rsquo;t been corrupted by that system (if that&rsquo;s possible), and sit around the campfire and spin yarns about how the times when giants walked the earth: that, at least, would be authentic. However, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->übermenschen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> among us don&rsquo;t take that path: they curse the teat that nourishes them, but they don&rsquo;t stop feeding off it. The kindest thing that could be said of such behavior is that it is disingenuous; a more sober assessment is that it is downright dishonest. Thus, it is my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->candid opinion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that such people, rather than being the champions of the underdog they profess to be, are really little more than pathetic parasites. Maybe that&rsquo;s an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->insult<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, maybe it&rsquo;s just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->honesty<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: you decide what works for you.</p>

<p>Ouch. By the way&hellip;Nick C., if you were offended by anything I said It certainly wasn&rsquo;t directed at you in particular. I was only saying that insulting someone is different than being candid, nothing more. I certainly didn&rsquo;t mean you when I stated that. I guess the problem with the internet is that you can&rsquo;t read &ldquo;tone&rdquo; or &ldquo;inflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To a degree I agree with you, but&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t go as far as calling a person a &ldquo;pathetic parasite.&rdquo; That is certainly a blatant insult and does little more than perpetuate the type of attitude that you&rsquo;re rallying against. Let&rsquo;s all rise above the name calling and just have a serious discussion. Opinions can clearly be stated without resorting to insult.

<p>Surely, it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be better to fix the things that are broken: that particular comment was not meant as a recommendation for the general populace. It was directed at those among us who deem themselves estimable for biting the hand that feeds them to walk the walk, instead of just talking (and talking and talking) the talk. That&rsquo;s what I meant about being authentic.</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is that the prevailing economic system is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so<!-- raw HTML omitted --> broken–in terms of fairness, in terms of the balance among the haves, the have-nots and the have-too-muches &ndash; that I don&rsquo;t believe that anything short of a total meltdown is going to change things substantively. We Westerners are, on the whole, just too comfortable with all the goodies that the status quo provides, adn that presents a tremendous amount of inertia in the path of change. I&rsquo;m no different: I have grown soft and accustomed to at least a modest version of &ldquo;the good life.&rdquo; On the other hand, I have never claimed to be different, to be &ldquo;smarter than the average peon.&rdquo;</p>
