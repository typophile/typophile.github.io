  body: "The issue can affect any name-keyed OpenType CFF font with large numbers
    of glyphs. I don't know why Apple specifically references Arno - we worked around
    their bug long before it was finished, even in the version included with the Photoshop
    CS3 public beta, IIRC.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thank you Thomas! What is a name keyed OpenType font?\r\n\r\nDoes this mean
    Contextual OpenType features are supported in MacOSX now or will I have to wait
    longer before I can use the Poetica small cap alternates in Pages?\r\n\r\nMike

  body: "OpenType CFF fonts (the kind with PostScript style outlines) are either name-keyed
    - like virtually all western fonts - or CID-keyed. CID-keyed fonts don't have
    glyph names, and have pre-defined character sets. One sees CID-keyed OpenType
    fonts mostly for the East Asian market, but also inside PDFs, for various technical
    reasons.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, you will have to wait on the contextual OpenType features
    in OS X. But one expects they will get there, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
