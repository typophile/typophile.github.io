  romans rather than sloped romans when it digitized Fairbank Italic? I've owned this
  typeface since its initial digital release and hate that I've never used it believing
  the metal design is vastly superior. \r\n\r\nThe digital ampersand just hurts and
  ugh the spacing & kerning is ridiculous. It took me a while to get anything that
  closely resembles the specimen listed in the Bixler catalogue (the above image in
  the attached pdf) and still . . . it's pretty weak. Any insights would be appreciated.
  I'll pipe down now like a good Typophile lurker should.\r\n"

  body: "This from Linotype's promotional copy:\r\n\r\n\". . . the face could have
    been lost, were it not for Robin Nicholas, Monotype Imaging's Head of Typography
    in the United Kingdom, and Carl Crossgrove, a senior designer for Monotype Imaging
    in the US. \r\n\r\nNicholas and Crossgrove used the original drawings for Fairbank
    as the starting point for a new digital design, but this was only the beginning.
    They improved spacing, added subtle kerning and optimized the design for digital
    imaging. In addition, Nicholas created an alternative set of lowercase letters,
    fancy and swash capitals and enough alternate characters to personalize virtually
    any design project. \r\n\r\nBy the time his work was complete, Nicholas and Crossgrove
    had created a small type family that included Fairbank, a revived version of the
    earlier metal font, and Fairbank Chancery, a more calligraphic rendition of the
    design. An additional suite of ornate caps, elegant ligatures, and beginning and
    ending letters accompanies both fonts, as does a full complement of lowercase
    swash characters. Now, instead of a failed Bembo italic, Fairbank emerges in its
    true glory: a sumptuous, elegant design that will lend a note of grace to holiday
    greetings, invitations, and any application where its Italianate beauty is called
    for.\"\r\n\r\nSo I am left to wonder if the original drawings for Fairbank contained
    these incomprehensibly bad roman caps, ampersand, etc. Or did Nicholas and Crossgrove
    just not finish the job. \r\n\r\nHey Monotype! Who do I complain to? "

  body: Thanks Kent. Fine idea. I will try it and if I can't get him looped into this
    thread, then I will report back with my findings for te good of the Typophilic
    record. Thanks again.
