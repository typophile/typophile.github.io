  body: "I was surprised to find how few fonts I could find that have curved legs
    on both the K and the R. One was Grouch, but the E and W were not similar, among
    many other differences. In fact, the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-grouch/itc-grouch/\">digital
    version</a> does not show the forms of the K and R that are shown in the old Phil's
    Photo 'Homage to the Alphabet'.\r\n\r\nI tried using my Serif Font ID Guide and
    couldn't get anything that was very close, either. This one therefore becomes
    tempting to label as custom, so I will be curious to see if anyone can spot it.\r\n\r\n-
