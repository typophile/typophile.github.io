body: "Dear Forum members,\r\n\r\nI am trying to implement caret positionining (see
  fontlab-manual 5, page 876) for ligatures in my opentype-font with fontlab 5. The
  carets are in position, but when using the exported font in indesign cs2, the caret
  is still positioned within the ligature as if nothing was changed.\r\n\r\nI do export
  the GDEF-Table, as said on page 878, but obviously something is wrong...\r\nDoes
  indesign CS2 support caret-positioning at all? Is there any setting that allows
  exporting the positioning data?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your Help\r\nsebilar"

  body: InDesign does not support GDEF caret positioning. Actually, I'm not sure than
    any applications do yet. Generally, applications just calculate the number of
    underlying characters in the ligature and divide the advance width by that ammount.

  body: By the backing string, i.e. the stored character codes that the type represents.
    So if you type ffi and it renders as a ligature, InDesign still knows that there
    are three characters in the backing string. The whole point of caret placement
    is to edit text, so you want the positioning to relate to the characters underlying
    a ligature, so that you know if you position the caret between the two fs of the
    ffi ligature and hit delete, you will remove the second f leaving fi.
