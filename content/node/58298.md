  looking for information on some fonts. What I need is the number of weights and
  styles, as well as general information (designers, special features, appearence,
  etc), in the bundled versions that ship with the following software:\r\n\r\n<strong>Ubuntu:</strong>\r\nURW
  Bookman L\r\nNimbus Roman No9 L\r\nNimbus Roman\r\nMG Open\tCanonica\r\nCentury
  Schoolbook L\r\nURW Gothic L\r\nFree Sans\r\nURW Palladio\r\n\r\n<strong>Ms Office
  03 Win</strong>\r\nNew Century Schoolbook\r\n\r\n<strong>Ms Office 07 Win</strong>\r\nNew
  Century Schoolbook\r\n\r\n<strong>Ms Office 04 Mac</strong>\r\nNew Century Schoolbook\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile
  I'm at it: I'd love to see a special interest group on web typography!"

  body: "My Office 2003/2007 doesn't include New Century Schoolbook, only the normal
    Century Schoolbook. It has 4 styles (Regular - censcbk.ttf, Italic - schlbki.ttf,
    Bold - schlbkb.ttf, Bold Italic - schlbkbi.ttf) and the designer is Morris Fuller
    Benton. OT-TTF version 2.35 with 669 glyphs, but no OT features or kerning pairs.
    \r\nYou can find more information here: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Schoolbook]]\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn van Berkel"
