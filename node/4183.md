body: This is my first post to the forum. I&#39;ve been interested in type design
  for a while now, but I just found this site. Recently as a project I was working
  on I thought it would be interesting to create a font using exclusively logo pieces.
  Consider this a modern day version of &#34;The ABCs.&#34; I doubt this is legal
  to do, but feedback would be appreciated nevertheless. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/3294.gif"

  body: ' actually I don&#39;t think its all that illegal. I think you need to get
    permission from alot of people but - FUSE or Fontek &#40;can&#39;t remember&#41;
    someone anyway puts together sets such as this - military symbols, cartographic,
    commercial &#40;visa, MC ect.&#41; and international association logotype sets.
    <BR> <BR>The tricky part would be in selling it - Why would any such firm or designer
    need these logos? whats the motivation? either they already have them as a client
    or they aren&#39;t needing them. '

    doesn&#39;t include any full logos, and it&#39;s not intended to substitute for
    a quality set of logo fonts. It was more of a personal challenge to see whether
    or not I could replace all of the characters of the alphabet with readily identifiable
    trademarks. I&#39;m actually making it as coursework for a class on activism and
    graphics. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/3296.gif"

    included a poster once using this idea. <BR>They used many of the same marks and
    it was <BR>actually very pretty. I think yours is too.

  body: ' it would be fun for adbusters.  <BR>be careful with them though. A close
    friend developed a spoof ad once while doing her BFA 5-6 years ago. She submitted
    it to Adbusters - they replied declining to publish. 2 months later they developed
    their own - undeniably influenced by her submission. <BR> <BR>otherwise you could
    add P from Pirelli tires, J from Johnson &amp; Johnson if ya want more '

  body: Hate to burst your bubble, but <a href="http://www.plazm.com">plazm fonts</a>
    is giving away a typeface exactly like that for free on thier website. I guess
    that proves it would be legal though &#40;or maybe thats why they&#39;re giving
    it away for free, since it might be illegal to actually sell the font&#41;.

  body: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/"> FontShop</a> have also done a divider
    page &#40;Script&#41; in the 1998 edition of the FontBook using <i>Capitalis Pirata</i>
    by Roland Henss, a student FUSE font of 1993 based on the same principle. I still
    think it&#39;s a fun exercise, though, and there are countless possible variations
    &#40;although chances are the &#34;M&#34; will be McShame&#39;s...&#41;.

  body: karl, I don&#39;t know from where you are but the fact that Hess designed
    Capitalis Pirata should not bother you. <BR>In fact Hess used many letters from
    german &#40;I think&#41; commercial logos and it would be really nice if everyone,
    from various countries, would produce a national version of Capitalis Pirata.
    <BR> <BR>After all we might end up having the most world-recognizable set of letters
    from commercial logos. Capitalis Pirata is pretty close, but some letters and
    numbers are obscure to me. <BR> <BR>Needless to say that probably it&#39;s legal
    until you give it away for free, or as a gift with another typeface at best.
