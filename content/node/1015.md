body: This is the latest thing I&#39;ve been playing with - off and on in whatever
  spare time I can find. It&#39;s the first Latin sans I&#39;ve attempted that&#39;s
  not a heavily geometric construction, so any input would be great. I was trying
  to throw some slight corners into certain characters &#40;o, e, c, etc.&#41; to
  open up the counters a bit. And have been playing with small flares and tapers on
  various letters. Not sure if either one is working to anyone&#39;s great satisfcation.
  &#34;vent&#34; is just a detail - and Ardbeg is just a whisky - the face is nameless
  as of yet. No upper case or figures yet either... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14608.gif"

  body: Wow. This has a really nice feel -- sort of a mix of a humanist sans and an
    expressionist form like Pressig, Manuscript or Journal. <BR> <BR>The lc &#34;v&#34;,
    &#34;w&#34; and &#34;x&#34; seem a bit heavy. I&#39;d try maybe making them a
    bit more modulated, with a bit more contrast between thick and thin strokes rather
    than the more monolinear approach that you have going now. Perhaps this should
    apply to the lc &#34;k&#34;, &#34;y&#34; and &#34;z&#34; as well. <BR> <BR>I like
    the ever-so-slightly wide lc &#34;z&#34;, too. I&#39;d leave it as is. <BR> <BR>The
    slight flaring at the terminals is a really nice touch, too. <BR> <BR>David

  body: Thanks for the suggestions fellas. I wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve thought to add some
    contrast to &#34;v&#34; et al, but I think it&#39;s working well. I still need
    to shave some weight from the &#34;x&#34;, but otherwise they&#39;re fitting in
    much better as far as color goes.  <BR> <BR>And I shortened the descenders a bit
    &#40;thanks for pointing that out, Eduardo&#41; - I hadn&#39;t even noticed how
    incredibly long they were. The &#34;g&#34; still needs a lot of work. When I shortened
    the descenders, I redrew it with the Beziers to bring it in line, but I think
    I really need to rework it on paper. It seems too light and perhaps too narrow
    all the sudden.  <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, I also fiddled some more with the terminal
    flares and notches at som eof the joints. I moved the top notch on &#34;p&#34;
    because the top joint is already tapered - it seemed more logical to trim the
    bottom joint. And I took a nibble out of the shoulders of &#34;m&#34;. <BR> <BR>Incidentally,
    the cyan is the first version, the black is the revision. I guess that&#39;s obvious.

  body: 'Seeing your text setting, I am excited that this promises to be a very readable
    sans even in text. It is narrow but very open because of the angular counters.
    You might compare Vesta, the new face of Gerard Unger at <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com"
    target="_blank">www.gerardunger.com</a>. It is one of the most readable sans I
    have seen, and your face promises to accomplish the same thing in a different
    way. He has rounded counters, and a narrow, humanist structure. He gets the openness
    partly by very narrow joins between round and straight strokes - a general feature
    of his designs.  <BR> <BR>You are approaching this in a different way, which gives
    a wonderful liveliness as well as good &#39;color&#39;. <BR> <BR>I like your new

    and sticks out, to my eyes. Is the problem that the link between the loop and
    the top of the g sticks out too far to the left? That the link should narrow more
    in the joining to the top? Or maybe that the bottom of the loop should be lightened,
    following the stress in serif fonts? Unger does all of these in Vesta. You have
    a very different look, but maybe there is a way to make the g more harmonious
    adapting these patterns to your deisgn.   '

  body: 'Ok, here are my thoughts on spacing sans serifs. They come only from experience
    of looking, not designing.  <BR> <BR>Spacing between letters, according to Walter
    Tracy and others should relate to the space in the counters of the letters, as
    well as varying with external letter shape. I think the thickness of the stems
    is also a factor.  <BR> <BR>The challenge with san serifs is that absent serifs
    the spacing looks wide, tending to break up the words. So sans often more closely
    spaced than serif faces. But this close spacing can hurt readability, IMHO. Here
    Helvetical/Arial is a prime offender. When you have very circular letters, as
    opposed to narrower ovals then balancing the spacing with the counters can get
    ridiculously wide. But putting them very close hurts readibility, as the shapes
    of the letters become lost in the crush. If you look at a text setting of Meta,
    which is narrower and has more space in relation to the counters, it is much more
    readable than Helvetica.  <BR> <BR>I tend to think that Hrant is just mistaken
    about the greater importance of the external outline of the word, the &#39;Bouma&#39;
    as he calls it, compared to the discernment of the shapes of the individual letters.
    I think that both are important. Thus wider spacing, to a point, helps, not hurts
    readibility. <BR> <BR>Another factor here is x-height. Another reason Futura is
    more readable than Helvetica, in spite of its circular letters, is that the smaller
    x height allows the space between letters to be looser and hence both more balanced
    and legible in relation to the spaces in the counters. And, yes, taller extenders
    also help on differentiating more the external outline of the words. <BR> <BR>With
    all these ruminations in mind, my reaction your spacing is that in the more black
    text setting the spacing is OK, but it is too loose in the case of the lightest
    weight.  <BR> <BR>In the lighter weights you might consider also narrowing the
    letter forms. If I am not mistaken &#40;I don&#39;t have the font&#41; I believe
    that is what Gerard Unger does with his Vesta. That way when you narrow the spacing
    - which the narrow stems also seem to call for - you still have balance between
    the inter-letter space and the internal counters. <BR> <BR>As I said earlier in
    this thread, I am really struck by how readable Vesta is as a sans. Unger has
    written a book about is views, and I am looking forward to the English edition,
    which I believe his site says he is working on.  <BR> <BR>As Randy said, and as
    I noted earlier when you posted a smaller text setting, it is striking how readable
    Ardbeg is in smaller text settings. I think you have going for you not only the
    narrower shapes and the open counters that the angularity gives you &#40;a la
    Dwiggens&#41;, but also a more generous x-height than Vesta.  <BR> <BR>All of
    this promises to have you end up with an exceptionally readable sans, which I
    think is great. I think playing with the letter widths as well as spacing with
    the different weights, as Vesta seems to do, may help you get to this goal. <BR>
    <BR>On the differences in the weights, Unger likes the relatively small differences
    between different weights, I guess based on the idea that what pairing of weights
    a designer would want would depend on the design and the paper. James Montalbano
    also gave a very interesting rationale <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14103.html?1060892227#POST25607"

    William. Based on that, I&#39;m wondering if there should be 3 steps between the
    regular &#40;fourth row in the PDF above&#41; and the heaviest weight. As opposed
    to 2. That would allow a Medium weight to function per James analysis. As the
    weights stand, I can&#39;t see them working as a regular &#43; bold and medium
    &#43; bold. <BR> <BR>&#62;according to Walter Tracy and others  <BR> <BR>I actually
    just picked up a copy of L.O.C. when I was at the Newberry Library last week.
    I had forgotten that it was in print again. I have yet to apply his scheme &#40;is
    it the same as Briem&#39;s?&#41; to Ardbeg however. That&#39;s this weekend&#39;s
    labor. <BR> <BR>As far as the spacing goes right now, I&#39;ve set the spacing
    for the regular weight - obviously it is in want of some tweaking. The lighter
    weights are optical spaced &#40;a la InDesign&#41; and tracked tighter - though
    not tightly enough. I haven&#39;t even begun to touch them for real. And the heavy
    weights have just some rudimentary side bearings set. Clumsy and horribly un-craftsman-like
    I know. <BR> <BR>That said, I shall attempt to tweak the letterfit of all the
    weights this weekend, concentrating on tightening the fit of the light weights.
    <BR> <BR>&#62;it allows you to make great quasi-fake smallcaps.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    I&#39;ll use this as my next test for weight distribution... <BR> <BR>&#62;In
    the lighter weights you might consider also narrowing the letter forms.  <BR>
    <BR>I may yet give this a try. In my head I was thinking that it would be best
    to err on the side of wider characters. To keep the counters open and such. Perhaps
    I have been on the wrong track.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m afraid this post is mostly me
    talking to myself and organizing my game-plan. I apologize for the useless prolixity.

    <BR> <BR>Not necessarily. Although an even number of weights is indeed generally
    better, when you get beyond a certain smoothness of gradation people will start
    pairing a &#34;Bold&#34; with a given base weight more freely. <BR> <BR>&#62;

    Here goes: A larger x-height means a smaller ascender/descender height, means
    a larger looking face compared to others of the same point size, requiring more
    spacing at the same optical size... Meanwhile, the shorter ascenders/ascenders
    gain you vertical space by decreasing the needed leading, which in shorter lines
    of copy controls the space economy much more than the width of a typeface or looseness
    of spacing. So you can easily afford a bit more width. As for examples I will

    counter of his heaviest weight is 44% smaller than the lightest. Also your n is
    actually narrower than his, if I am comparing like weights correctly. However,
    because of Ardbeg&#39;s squared-off structure Eric Olsen may be right &#40;or

    I guess one issue to check is the relationship between the counters in the pbod

    logic probably comes to the same thing, but it&#39;s really much simpler: a smaller

    simply when you set a given font smaller &#40;= smaller x-height&#41; the space

  body: '&#62;Futura has wider spacing than Helvetica because it&#39;s designed better.
    <BR> <BR>Ok, I can buy that Futura is better designed.  <BR>However, I think there
    is more going on here. When I track Helvetica progressively wider, and the same
    with Futura, the words of Helvetica seem to fall apart and the whole look too
    loose long before Futura falls apart.  <BR> <BR>I think the longer extenders hold
    together the &#39;Boumas&#39; &#40;ack! did I say that?&#41; better, so the smaller
    x-height sans can take looser spacing. In other words, I think the Helvetical
    designer did the spacing he did for a good reason, even though it messes up the
    readability at small sizes.   <BR>  <BR>&#62;a larger looking face compared to
    others of the same point size, requiring more spacing at the same optical size.
    <BR> <BR>Well, Tracy says that the spacing should match the counters, which don&#39;t
    change with varying the extenders. But he didn&#39;t discuss sans serifs. If you
    look at digital Gill sans, and type iio, the space between the ii is much smaller
    than the counter of the o, whereas in say Times it is very similar. Now I think
    I read that Gill in metal was spaced much wider, but again I think the digital
    adjustments were in response to a problem that the spacing looked too loose in
    the metal.  <BR> <BR>Ok, the following is just a pet theory of mine, but there
    may be something in it. My theory is that without serifs you not only have problems
    visually finding the line of text, but also the spacing problems become substantial.
    Space a sans like a serif, and the words fall apart. Space it closely, and the
    legibility and hence readibility decreases in small &#40;text&#41; sizes. Hence
    sans are usually harder to read in text sizes. Large, the tight spacing is not
    a problem, as the absolute space between letters is big enough that legibility
    is not hurt.  <BR> <BR>I think the x-height and weight of the stem also affect
    how spacing works, especially with a sans. Also with narrower designs, the problems
    aren&#39;t so severe. I don&#39;t know what Unger has figured out about all this,
    but from the PDF of his Vesta, which mixes sans and serifs impressively, he has
    some new insights.  <BR> <BR>So even two Hrants &#40;shudder <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41; don&#39;t convince me.  <BR> <BR>&#62;Monarchy fovea
    bouma notan <BR>Democracy, iris, letter, notan &#40;ok, I like notan&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>The relevance to Nathan&#39;s spacing challenges in different weights is this
    the following. I don&#39;t have a clear theory of how to space a sans. But my
    point is that there is more in spacing a sans than is usually realized, and that
    therefore it is worth experimenting with both letter width and spacing, rather
    than just one or the other, if you have a goal of readability in text for your
    sans. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    weight, proportions, etc. a good type designer will use the right amount of spacing,

    it should be possible to do both quite well.  <BR> <BR>I was talking about a single

  body: 'At the risk of waking a sleeping dog, I thought I&#39;d post again to this
    thread. I&#39;ve been fooling around with the italics for this face [finally]
    and I&#39;m at a point where I could certainly use some input. <BR> <BR>Originally
    I intended to make the italic companion more &#39;cursive&#39; that what I&#39;ve
    ended up with. The cursive forms just didn&#39;t seem to make sense when paired
    with the roman. So, instead, I&#39;ve gone &#40;1&#41; lighter, &#40;2&#41; narrower,
    &amp; &#40;3&#41; slightly looser. Hoping that that&#39;s enough to differentiate
    it from the roman.  <BR> <BR>The slope is somewhat slight : about 5%, though I&#39;ve
    taken Hrant&#39;s advice to others and used a <i>slope</i> of 1/11. Italic caps
    have [obviously] less work done on them. Slope is much less at 1/28 &#40;about
    2%&#41;. Caps are heavier than the lower case&#0151;perhaps much too heavy&#0151;and
    wider. At this point they&#39;re just the roman slanted.  <BR> <BR>Also, the letterfit
    is tighter than before. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: 040423-34184.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*43.4**040423%2epdf

  body: I don&#39;t know about the looseness. If you&#39;re having trouble making
    the italics stand out I&#39;d rather see [more] lightness, or maybe a steeper
    slope &#40;like 1/8, a nice power-of-two invert&#41;. You might even make the
    x-height slightly smaller. <BR> <BR>&#62; .... a slope of 1/11 <BR> <BR>Cool.
    <BR>Now you know that for every 11 units you move vertically you need to move
    1 unit horizontally, and maintain the exact slope angle. Note that your vertical
    proportions should ideally be multiples of 11! <BR> <BR>&#62; 1/28 <BR> <BR>That
    seems a bit low - the slant might disappear at lower resolutions. You might try
    1/16. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    it make a difference for output, or make the maths more efficient, etc.?

  body: 'Not really. In fact a decimal base is easier to work with during editing;
    like 1/10 and 1/20 might be better here. I&#39;m just a binary boy, that&#39;s
    all. On the other hand, powers of 2 are: <BR>1&#41; easier to halve. <BR>2&#41;
    in tune with TrueType&#39;s &#34;ideal&#34; Em values; like an Em of 1024 or 2048
    will actually render [marginally] faster in the TT engine. On the other other
    hand: you can still use the talus &#40;internal leading&#41; to pad decimal proportions
    to a binary &#34;frame&#34;; for PS fonts &#40;at least the ones output from Fog&#41;
    an Em of 1000 is <i>required</i> - and that&#39;s decimal. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Hi Nathan. <BR> <BR>This is shaping up to be a useful addition. Surprised
    at how small it sets. Lots of internal leading going on. 11 looks like 9. Looks
    good, but I might scale everything up 10%. <BR> <BR>Some general comments: <BR>I
    think the lc italic is working fine. The upper has issues as you mention. It is
    much too dark. I tend to like caps that match the lc color very closely. To that
    end even your Roman caps look dark to me. Also, I&#39;d add a touch more slant
    to the Italic caps &#40;could just be the dark color that&#39;s over-emphasizing
    it&#41; <BR> <BR>Specifics: <BR>W: Not digging the crossing. It makes a huge black
    spot. Maybe in a titling version, or the light, but here it&#39;s too much IMHO.
    <BR>v,w: Watch for optical illusions in the stress. Looks left heavy. <BR>w: Looks
    dark. <BR>Q: Thin the tail join <BR>F: Drop the crossbar a hair lower than the
    E <BR>S,s: Not digging the curves. The spine looks like he broke his back in 2
    places. A bit less abrupt, but keeping the corner? <BR>d: Consider reversing the
    cut angle on the stem for uniformity. <BR>!: Looks dark. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy'

    few more projects &#40;a serif text face, another Thai bitmap, a Renner revival
    for a friend, etc.&#41; but at this point I hate them all. So maybe - if I don&#39;t
    spend all my time obsessing over this face - I&#39;ll have something else for
    this year&#39;s competition.
