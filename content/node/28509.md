  I can about Typography and Layout. I am wondering if any of you experts out there
  can give me any tips on the best ways to go about learning about typography and
  layout. I have a good degree in Graphic Design and I am very conceptually based
  with my approach to design solutions. I have a basic knowledge of Typography but
  I am now focussing on improving my type and becoming highly skilled in this area.
  Can anyone offer any info. Much appreciated. \r\n\r\nCheers. "

    probably hundreds that aren't as great. While you're reading, pay attention to
    the way the books are set\u2013it's hard to find better typography than what you'll
    see in good books on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt's also good to look for bad typography
    and learn from the mistakes of others. You'll find plenty of bad type online,
    cheap magazines are also generally overflowing with the stuff."

  body: "<em> Why God is in the detail?</em>\r\n\r\nbecause (Lizzie knows) that is
    where the Devil also resides\r\n\r\nI've just had a look at 'Exploring Typography'
    by Tova Rabinowitz, (Publisher Thomson Delmar Learning, 2006. ISBN 1401815057)
    and I can recommend it as a general-purpose text (covers a lot of ground, including
    some layout) There is also the <a/href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/Triumvirate\">Triumvirate</a>
    to which I would add <a/href=\"http://www.logofontandlettering.com/\">Leslie Cabarga's
    Logo Font and Lettering Bible.</a>\r\n\r\nBut more than that, if you hold a graphic
    design degree already, go out to work. Preferably with some seasoned old timers
    who would like to mentor you in the finer aspects... trade knowledge beats book
    knowledge, but in typography they are sometimes the same thing."
