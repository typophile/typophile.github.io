  body: "It was a privilege being entrusted with this small but fascinating modification
    of DejaVu-Mono*. Splicing in a character from one writing system into the heart
    of another was a unique design challenge; figuring out how to make the transplant
    look simultaneously native (because a font must work as one) and alien (because
    this singularity must inherently be explicit) was a pleasurable paradox!\r\n\r\n*
