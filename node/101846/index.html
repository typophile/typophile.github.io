  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>At my local public library they have a pretty extensive collection on printing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.provlib.org/spc-updikeephemera">http://www.provlib.org/spc-updikeephemera</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for something to digitize and distribute online to promote the collection and that would also just be cool for people to have/have access to. I came across a specimen book for Peignot that was printed in an edition of 50, one for this collection specifically. I was wondering if anyone had any information on the copyright of this document? I&rsquo;m attaching what I think to be the colophon, and title page. After running it through Google Translate it seems to not contain the information, as an American, I usually think of defining a copyright.</p>
<p>Is it legal for me to scan this document and put it online? Does anyone know who I could contact to get permission or find out?</p>
<p>Also, is this something people would be interested in seeing? As Peignot is available as a digital font it seems like this might not be as compelling as some of the other stuff in their collection. However, it does seem kind of unique because of the low print run, and it&rsquo;s really nice to see in person (which I know is sort of contradictory to digitizing it, but maybe it would compel people to visit). Is there anything else people could recommend looking for in that collection that may be of more interest to people? There&rsquo;s some 20th century stuff, but I think the bulk of the collection is 19th and 18th century – which may be more uncommon?  The collection is pretty extensive, and I&rsquo;m not too familiar with typographic history, especially stuff that hasn&rsquo;t been digitized. Any advice on the matter and how to approach the collection is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Well, in the States (California&rsquo;s still one of &lsquo;em), digitizing the typeface to make fonts would be perfectly legal, even if the drawings had been done yesterday. Digitizing the book, on the other hand, would be a copyright issue. I believe heirs can maintain copyright, for a while. You&rsquo;d need to check.</p>

<p>No longer true, unfortunately, due to Mickey Mouse. (Insert usual disclaimer that you really need to ask a lawyer, not us.) The copyright term in France is life of author plus 70 years (this probably counts as a corporate work by D&amp;P, so it has probably been public domain in France after 2007), but the peculiarities of (1) how the US applies copyright law to foreign works and (2) the Mickey Mouse extensions to copyright term in the US mean that because it was published after 1926, it won&rsquo;t be public domain in the United States before 2032:

<p>Who would own that copyright now? I think I used to know back when I was researching a Deberny font from the turn of the century, but now I can&rsquo;t remember. Anyway it should be possible to get their permission, since it&rsquo;s a worthy project (at least I think so).</p>
<p>BTW if you&rsquo;re really serious you could produce (in addition to a scanned* PDF) a letterpress edition (of 50 copies :-) using photopolymer plates, and maybe even sell some copies for good money.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bummer I&rsquo;ll have to wait until after 2037. I suppose I&rsquo;ll contact the now owners of D&amp;P, which seems to be Monotype, and see what I can do. These copyright issues are pretty astounding (especially that the font wouldn&rsquo;t be, but the specimen book would be copyrighted!), judging from the general consensus I hear online and in the media, it&rsquo;s become a pretty odd and imbalanced thing at the moment.</p>
<p>@Chris Dean I am planning to use a DIY Book Scanner, they seem really great and accessible.</p>
<p>If anyone has requests for other things to scan or advice on what to look out for, I&rsquo;d really appreciate it. Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, each case is weighed against four factors, one of which is “quantity or percentage of the original copyrighted work”, but that is only one quarter of the balancing test. It’s true that the law is quite fuzzy on Fair Use and there are many examples of two similar cases that have fallen on either side of the fence in court rulings, so of course it’s best to first ask permission of the copyright holder. But I think the exception could apply to this project.</div>

<p>Linotype would own the rights to the Deberny &amp; Peignot library, which means now that ultimately Monotype does; I would get in touch with them. The page you scanned isn&rsquo;t the copyright page (if there is one); it&rsquo;s just the traditional note at the end of French books about where and when it was printed.</p>
