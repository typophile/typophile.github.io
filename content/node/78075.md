  design of Restaurant menus? (I can't seem to find any.)\r\n\r\nThere are some books
  with visual examples of creative menus, but no solid textbooks that I can see?\r\n
  \r\nAlso, if anyone has any recommendations of the latter (books with visual examples
  of creative menus eg Pentagram) then they'd be most welcome too.\r\n\r\nIt would
  be nice to have a long thread here, as a resource for other food menu designers.
  \r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: This isn't engineering design. What's to know? You name the dish, and the
    price, then lay it out nicely. You'd be far better off collecting menus than searching
    for the definitive textbook.

  body: "Hi Bloodtype,\r\n\r\nThanks for your post.\r\n\r\nIt is menu engineering
    design, in fact, it's an entire field of information design. \r\nJust like other
    areas of information design there are things to be learned from the combination
    of psychology and design that are behind the structure of the menu. \r\n\r\nNBC
    and Time magazine both recently ran stories on menu engineering design. Just like
    any area of design, laying it out nicely without any thought to the way it should
    function best would be a naive step. \r\n\r\nCollecting menus sounds like a good
    plan though, thanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have not seen such a book.  I would think the best way to approach it is
    to think like a patron of the place and plot out how the menu would function best
    for you.  You might also ask a few non-designer friends what their expectations
    would be of a menu.  The other end of the spectrum would be how the management
    of the establishment uses the menu functionally.  Do they have an agenda where
    they are emphasizing or featuring certain items or combinations? I guess I am
    saying \"Walk a mile in another man's moccasins\" (or several) and look for a
    process that interlocks the needs of the client with the needs of the proprietor.
    The design process for most things of this genre is not so different--Audience,
    Purpose, Message on one side and an elegant path to the communication destination
    on the other. \r\nYou certainly need a predictable system that the clientele can
    follow. You also should at least reflect the ambience of the place and type of
    food. Ask yourself, why do people come to this place? The answer is different
    for a fast food joint, a business lunch place, a dinner date place.  It is also
    textured with the cuisine or ethnic basis of the food--an English pub as opposed
    to a Thai or Lebanese place.  \r\nAlso, think about the amount of time people
    will spend with the menu, not only to find their choice of dish for the night,
    but as a visitors experience.  The difference between an info-graphics presentation
    and a menu is that visitors of restaurants are looking for an experience as well
    as a meal.  \r\nPerhaps the book you should read is \"Black Elk Speaks\"?"

    Mind Games\r\nIn his new book, Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take
    Advantage of It), author William Poundstone dissects the marketing tricks built
    into menus\u2014for example, how something as simple as typography can drive you

    design.</em>\r\n\r\nWhy apologize for what we do, and try to pass it off as something
    assumed to be more socially acceptable, intellectually respectable, and financially
    valuable? Such pretense only demeans graphic design.\r\n\r\nSure, it is possible
    to talk about a well-engineered graphic design, just as one may describe a beautiful
    piece of engineering \u2014but this is metaphor, and it doesn't make the graphic
    designer an engineer, or the engineer a beautician.\r\n\r\nFunctionality is an
    inherent part of graphic design and typography, not a hybrid add-on.\r\n\r\nThat
    \"empirical\" aspect of design which is sometimes interpreted as engineering concerns
    demographics, market research and statistics, and (as jabez notes) has more to
    do with applied psychology.\r\n\r\nThe real engineering of graphic design is in
    the nuts and bolts of typography\u2014manipulating type size, weight, style, scaling,
    leading, justification, tracking, kerning, colour and tone."

  body: "Hi Hellbox,\r\nI've done a lot a research on this subject. I'm a graphic
    designer trying to persuade restaurant owner to use menu engineering when designing
    their menus. I find it fascinating. And if you read the studies, it works to increase
    revenue for restaurant owners.\r\n\r\nYou can find some useful links on my website
    on the link page http://menumonde.com/liens/  under the headers \"Les \xE9tudes\"
    & \"La Presse\" These headers are in French, but all the links there are in English
    and relate to strictly to menu engineering/graphic design.\r\n\r\nI've read that
    this a good book on the topic Food Service Menus: Pricing and Managing the Food
    Service Menu for Maximun Profit (The Food Service Professional Guide to Series
    13) ISBN-10: 0910627231.\r\n\r\nThis blog on the subject also provides some visual
    examples of engineered menus:  http://www.hotoperator.com/\r\n\r\nCheers, Susan"

  body: "I'm a graphic designer and although I don't do any menu design myself I've
    come across a few articles on the subject and find it interesting. However many
    of the articles I've seen focus mainly on the writing of menus, rather than the
    graphic design. For example, in the article \"Ten Commandments of Menu Success\"
    - http://tinyurl.com/4vx2jpf - nine of the ten \"commandments\" relate primarily
    to writing, and when they do discuss typography it's mostly common-sense advice
    (make it legible, don't mix too many fonts, etc).  \r\n\r\nI have seen some articles
    that touch on graphic design elements such as menu organization and whether or
    not to list prices in columns, and I did find the advice interesting and sometimes
    surprising, but I'm not sure there's really enough advice out there to warrant
    someone printing a whole book on the subject.  Not unless the book is mainly just
    photos of nice menus & restaurant signage; I have seen a few of those, and I think
    Amazon has a few. "
