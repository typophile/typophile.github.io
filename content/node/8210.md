body: Hello, <BR> <BR>Apologies if this topic has been answered before.  I was wondering
  about using fonts in something to be published as a commerical project. <BR> <BR>From
  what I&#39;ve gathered, it&#39;s alright to use fonts that came with a piece of
  legitimate software in derivative works without any further requirements.  Thus,
  it&#39;d be safe to use a computer which has no internet-downloaded fonts for such
  projects. <BR> <BR>Is this correct?  Is there any problem with using a font, breaking
  the letters into outlines, and adjusting them for a logo or book cover graphic?  What
  would this mean under the EULA? <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: You shouldn&#39;t have any problems with the ways in which you wish to use
    the font software. The stickiest problem most people run into is embedding in
    PDFs to be re-sold &#40;dowloadable books&#41; or some other form of reselling
    the font software itself.  <BR> <BR>You might be interested in a <a href="http://fontlab.wikidev.net/The_Case_for_a_User-Friendly_EULA"
    target="_blank">chart</a> which was created by Nathan Matteson and myself in regards
    to comparing a handful of type foundry&#39;s EULAs. <BR> <BR>In general the <a
    href="http://fontlab.wikidev.net/Main_Page" target="_blank">FontLab Wiki</a> has
    a lot of interesting information and I would encourage more non-type designers
    to read it.
