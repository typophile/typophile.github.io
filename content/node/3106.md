  design school I obviously had new reasons &#40;and excuses&#41; to continue  <BR>with
  this obsession, or if you like, fetish. Over the years since I have  <BR>witnessed
  great magazines and/or great design, come and go with the tides.  <BR>Remember _Interview_
  when Tibor Kalman was in charge? It was an amazing  <BR>example of great magazine
  design. And what of _Rolling Stone_ before  <BR>Photoshop and Illustrator made some
  things too easy? Or _Vogue_ during the  <BR>height of Supermodeldom? Not to mention
  anything that Fabian Baron touched,  <BR>or so it seemed, in the nineties? <BR>
  <BR>Perhaps my references show my love of a more traditional time, but I really  <BR>have
  many questions and I&#39;ll wager others would like to hear a serious  <BR>discussion
  about magazine design and typography. And perhaps while we&#39;re at  <BR>it we
  could list out favorites and least favorites. In view of the forum we  <BR>are on
  the list should include both creative director and the typefaces  <BR>used.&#42;&#42;
  This discussion, or my guilt, are born out of two recent redesigns  <BR>and one
  wish for involvement in a redesign. <BR> <BR>First, _Harper&#39;s Bazaar_. I love
  the magazine, I love Didot, but ... &#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Second, _Fast Company_.
  I only just recv&#39;d this issue in the mail today, but  <BR>Ty&#39; fa is gone  The
  design IMO is still strong, the content not gotten weak.  <BR>I suppose when I saw
  the flag I was a little depressed. I like it, in an of  <BR>itself, but there are
  so many business magazines with sans serif screaming  <BR>from the top. I suppose
  I should hold judgement until I go the bookstore and  <BR>see for myself. <BR> <BR>Last,
  what ever happened to _Vogue_? <BR> <BR>QUESTION:  Do type foundries ever approach
  publication houses with the  <BR>desire to change the look? Or is this considered
  arrogant? Is it any more  <BR>arrogant than a design studio approaching them? <BR>
  <BR>&#42;It is an addiction I picked up very early on in my life starting with my  <BR>stacks
  of _Seventeen_. &#42;&#42; Perhaps a pattern could be shown? &#42;&#42;&#42; The
  word I  <BR>have in mind is overkill. '

    I think it usually seems desperate, which doesn&#39;t make it a bad idea for a
    yet-to-be-established operation. Unless you go in saying &#34;your magazine looks

    is a really tight magazine design wise in consideration to who their target market
    is. their grid concept is easy to navigate and read. production wise, the cover
    is two colours, it stands apart from anything that is beside it and saves money
    for the publisher which is a bonus. i bought their first issues &#40;1&#43; years
    ago&#41; that had the new design and i think it mentioned that pentagram did it.
    <BR> <BR>as a side note i&#39;m still very sad that critique is no longer available...

  body: ' Tiffany, you had a wonderful idea, starting a magazine design discussion!
    <BR>I share with you a chronic case of M.A. &#40;Magazine Addiction&#41;. Living
    in Milan, Italy, I have easy access to almost all American and European magazines.
    Being not only a magaholic, but a graphic designer also, I especially buy design
    publications, but also quite a few &#34;lifestyle&#34; magazines &#40;and many
    more, not on a regular basis&#41;. After a few years of working mostly on web
    sites &#40;I still work for the italian office of one of those very large - and
    very, very worried - web consultancy firms&#41; I decided to get back to my first
    love, print, only this time I want to do things on my own terms. <BR>So, with
    the help of a journalist friend, I am currently working on my first magazine design
    project &#40;a new title that we&#39;re starting from scratch and - hopefully
    - one day eventually publish, if we find the right financial backing&#41;. We
    plan to create a dummy issue and then show it around. <BR>So I will gladly participate
    in this discussion. I am currently asking myself so many magazine design questions
    working on this project, so I think it will be great to share my opinions with
    you guys! <BR>My flat has always been packed with old/new magazines, but as you
    can imagine, now that I am working on one, it&#39;s even worse. <BR>So, regarding
    your first posting: I also have fond memories for Baron, Woodward and Kalman at
    their creative peaks, and I rate their work like some of the best magazine design
    ever.It is still fresh today, which is NOT what could be said of a certain other
    magazine art director/surfer who once believed to be god and has currently been
    sucked in a black hole, apparently. <BR>Are you guys aware of the work of Fernando
    Gutierrez, the spanish creative director behind Vanidad, Matador, Tentaciones
    and who is currently designing Colors Magazine? His work is fantastic, maybe you
    saw a great article about him on a not-so-recent issue of Eye Magazine? What do
    you guys think of him? <BR>Ciao a tutti, from Milan. '

    straight-forward. No &#34;tricky-feathers&#34; &#40;to quote a former teacher&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; I really liked Paula Scher&#39;s redesign of Metropolis. <BR> <BR>Although
    I really am guilty of loving the over-sized magazines, especially when they are
    typographically amazing, the re-design has kept much of what was good in the first
    place. It seems to have all-around been proportionally scaled. Ergo, same ratio
    of positive to negative space.  <BR> <BR>&#62; strategy&#43;business <BR> <BR>This
    one is nice as well. The writing is a little too heady for me, but the typogrpahy
    is straight-forward and doesn&#39;t make the reader perform too much to find the
    info. <BR> <BR>&#62; critique <BR> <BR>I was lucky enough to be purchasing this
    as it was published. My favorite of the issues was that on mentoring. It was a
    great tool for teaching as well. My students really enjoyed the bits of info put
    before them and were able to digest it and use it.  <BR> <BR>The paper suggestion,
    Michael&#39;s, is a good idea. Some paper companies do try to combine education
    and promotion, such as Sappi.  <BR> <BR>&#62; Considering that the staple colors  <BR>&#62;
    are red, black and white... <BR> <BR>Pentagram is not the only company guilty
    &#40;although I don&#39;t think it such a bad color combination&#41; of using
    the holy trinity of colors. A study of all the magazines which <A HREF="http://www.daniloblackusa.com/">
    Roger Black and Danilo Black</A> has been involved with will quickly show that
    he is probably even more so. Guilty that is. Although Pentagram is more Sans and
    Transitional and Black is more Egyptian and Oldstyle. <BR> <BR>&#62; aware of
    Fernando Gutierrez <BR> <BR>Didn&#39;t he work with Roger Black at one point?
    <BR> <BR>&#62; wassup with that &#34;Discuss&#34;?! <BR> <BR>;-&#41; my mistake.
    ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; Naw, not school teacher... <BR> <BR>Joe, that would make
    a good handle. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">  <BR>
    <BR>&#62; I have chronic M.A., too.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d bet most people with any
    involvement in typography probably have to go to border&#39;s for at least a weekly
    fix. i love shopping online, but the feel of the paper and the smell of the ink,
    now that is a rush!  <BR> <BR>Seriously. <I>Esquire</I> is great. &#40;doesn&#39;t
    hurt that Jude Law is on the cover. An amazing example of taking a face that perhaps
    is intended for body text and using it in a dynamic way for display purposes.
    Although it is a display version of the face. I also enjoy <I>Town &amp; Country&#39;s</I>
    use of Requiem. In general, this is a well thought out magazine.  <BR> <BR>For
    all of you helvetica nay-sayers. Does anyone remember Michael Koepke&#39;s work
    on <I>Creme</I>? He truly pushed that typeface into new directions. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    Vince Frost <BR> <BR>That&#39;s right. That magazine is so... refined, sterile,
    great judgment &#40;pick a word&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; try to utter the word BRODOVITCH
    to a bunch  <BR>&#62; of snowboard-obsessed &#34;new media&#34; designers <BR>
    <BR>;&#41; Right! Have you seen the Book? The book itself is a perfect addition
    to anyone&#39;s library. I&#39;ve used it in publication design class to show
    great use of composition. Cipe Pineles is another example of great design BM &#40;before
    macintosh&#41;. And you can&#39;t forget the work of Paul Rand either. <BR> <BR>Does
    anyone remember <I>Details</I> before it became a men&#39;s magazine? It was a
    who&#39;s who and what&#39;s what of Manhattan life. I coveted those. Why oh why
    did I throw them away? Does anyone know who designed those? Or what about <I>TAXI</I>?
    Sheesh my age is showing again. <I>Egg</I> was pretty cool too. It had to have
    been one of the first magazines to try a square format. <I>Flaunt</I> is really
    good for straight-forward &#40;but with a wink&#41; typography. Although I have
    a feeling it is more of a men&#39;s magazine. Hrant would like this one! ;&#41;
    The latest issue is all about Italy, how timely for those of us going. <BR> <BR>Admittedly
    I&#39;m more old-school. But is this such a bad thing? Isn&#39;t design about
    discovery and re-discovery? Especially with type. I suppose the urge to design
    type comes from not wanting to use what is there already. But for magazine design
    this is not always feasible, therefore you find yourself on a road of discovery.
    Asking questions and looking for answers from what is there. But trying to take
    the answers and use them in new ways. <BR> <BR>Magazine design isn&#39;t so different
    from building a house. The structure&#39;s skeleton &#40;grid&#41; must be strong
    enough to hold the rest. If you have a wonky grid then everything else will never
    hold strong or make sense.'
