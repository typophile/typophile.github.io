  it far too much along with bembo and a few other serifs. problem? i have to do an
  identity for a vintage clothing store and i''m trying to use a sans serif, although
  after about 50 tries and a few oddball fonts they all feel far too modern. any suggestions? '

    It generally fits the era.

    period? Nineteenth century or orange-tag Nike?

  body: For vintage inspiration and ideas, look at magazines of the era. Most of the
    20th century is certainly represented well with sans serif, but what you're probably
    missing is the differences in how type was set, spaced, arranged or accented in
    previous decades. Helvetica used in the 1950s is recognizably different from how
    Helvetica is used in 2008.

  body: im using a wide range. 40's-80's. i have a ton of old life magazines, but
    im looking for new sources of inspiration. there are a few boutiques in soho that
    just specialize in vintage but they have the same aesthetic as any other modern
    clothing store. it all looks nice but im getting bored of wood floors , white
    walls, and little else. this is for a school assignment i probably should have
    clarified that.

    could be great. There\u2019s something really intriguing about their contemporary
    interpretations of history that people just can\u2019t miss. On the much less
    expensive side are Bitstream\u2019s revivals, which capture a lot of the funky
    quirks that type had back when designers weren\u2019t endlessly revising their
    fonts to digital perfection. Custom distressed Cooper or Cheltenham would be really
    cool for vintage, and you could combine it with Alternate Gothic or Franklin Gothic
    to get some cool arresting heads."

  body: "one thing I've seen done is the shifting of the baseline between adjacent
    characters. The up-down-up-down arrangement of letters is (I think off the top
    of my head) a 50s/early 60s thing. You'll also want to pick a color palette from
    the era.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that for anything before the 60s/70s, titles
    as often as not would be hand-lettered even if they were done in a specific typeface.
    So it makes sense to go in and convert that type to a path and tweak the letter
    shapes to fit the particular word, phrase, or container, the same way someone
    would have done when drawing the letters."

    from the SoHo vintage stores you mentioned, I'd steer clear of Helvetica. It's
    just not an evocative font.\r\n\r\nIt freaks me out that clothing I wore in college
    (80s) could be considered vintage. OTOH, I was wearing a lot of vintage clothing
    myself back then - 30s and 40s stuff. My mom used to joke that one day I'd come

    is that it has a sort of Neville Brody vibe.\r\n\r\nOne thing Lauren has not shared

    have much to do with what type works.\r\n\r\nBTW, I\u2019ve never seen a resale
    shop that had a particularly good identity so there is much room to do something
    really nice.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to go Douglas Sirk with an A. Paul script,
    but I don\u2019t think that would hit the market really.\r\n\r\nOne of the best

    the Swiss/German Modernists and International style. It was later supplanted by
