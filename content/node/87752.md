body: "My client is combing two magazines with 2 different sets of demographics. 20-40
  women and 55+ They want to retain the lifestyle magazine look of the younger magazine,
  but bring in the older set. The font size was 9.5/13 Jansen which is obviously not
  going to work for the older set. \r\n\r\nTo add another challenge the format is
  going down from letter size to 6\"x9\"...\r\n\r\nWhat text font would you recommend?
  I'm assuming I'll need to go with 11-12pt size. I'm thinking something with a narrow
  x width, to make up for lost real estate (maybe?)... but it needs to be readable.\r\n\r\nI'm
  using whitney sidebars etc.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any advice you can offer!"

  body: "> I'm thinking something with a narrow x width, to make up for lost real
    estate\r\n\r\nNarrowness doesn't necessarily result in economy, since paragraph\r\nbreaks
    waste much of the lateral savings; a wider font can be set\r\nsmaller and save
    space every line no matter the paragraph breaks.\r\nSo it depends on how \"paragraphy\"
    the writing is.\r\n\r\nThat said, I believe that narrowness is feminine and classy,
    which\r\nfits both your demographic sets. But it can also be harder to read,\r\nespecially
    for older people...\r\n\r\nTo me it sounds like you need a somewhat narrow font
    that works\r\nwell around 12pt. And it might be good if it were a bit \"expressive\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    young whippersnapper with relatively good vision, but I don't think the 55+ demographic
    has that much trouble with 9-10pt type. They've been reading that (or smaller)
    their entire life. Am I way off base on this?\r\n\r\n(Have you seen the 'Download

    we get older, changes in the eye make it more difficult to focus on objects that
    are very close (like a magazine). That's why many folks start using reading glasses
    or bifocals when they reach middle age. \r\n\r\nBut even with proper glasses,
    reading for extended periods may be more tiring. And not all folks get proper
    glasses, due to vanity or cost or reluctance to see an eye doctor.\r\n\r\nAnd
    among folks a little older than that, you can get cataracts, macular degeneration,
    and other medical problems that can make reading even more difficult.\r\n\r\nIf
    your magazine is aimed at 55+ folks, maybe around 11 point would be more comfortable.
    You might want to do some readability tests with folks in that age group.\r\n"

    have empathy, but the idea that because someone has been reading a certain setting
    all their life means they will have no problem with it at 55+, is wrong. The Agnes
    glasses would demonstrate that, I presume.\r\n\r\nWhy not produce a variety of
    settings in different fonts, set some sample pages, and conduct a focus group?"
