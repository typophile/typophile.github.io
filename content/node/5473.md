  body: This article completely fails to understand and explain the situation, instead
    quoting people &#40;eg from Razorfish&#41; on a subject &#40;font economics&#41;
    they know nothing about.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Yeah, we should get a union -- except
    as self-employed workers, that would consitute a cartel in the US, which is why
    illustrators and photographers don&#39;t have unions.&#41;   <BR> <BR>If Chank&#39;s
    font is used by a third party &#40;a small design firm&#41; to create a piece
    of artwork, say, the wordmark for a campaign, for a large corporation, he &#34;sells&#34;
    one font licence to the supplier, no matter how many times the wordmark is reproduced
    by that supplier&#39;s client.  <BR> <BR>If the large corporation installs his
    font on all its corporate computers, so that all its in-house marketing departments
    can use it for ongoing typesetting for their ID and marketing, then he can sell
    a multi-user licence for a far higher price. And if the typeface has a family,
    that helps sales too. <BR> <BR>This is, one would assume, what happened in the
    $6,000 Ocean Spray &#34;deal&#34; &#40;ie contract&#41; mentioned in the article,
    but the writer doesn&#39;t explain why &#34;negotiated directly&#34; is so much
    more lucrative, leaving it open to suggestion that it&#39;s all about Chank&#39;s
    mythical Elvis-like charisma and Donald-ish powers of negotiation. <BR> <BR>Chank
    has the right idea. As long as fonts are durable tools, type designers will have
    a tough, competitive retail market . <BR> <BR>If we can make fonts totally ephemeral
    consumable fashion items, that&#39;s a better much market. <BR> <BR>Rockstar fonts
    is a start, but the real money is in licensing deals with the celebrity du jour.
    Anyone know Paris Hilton&#39;s email address?  <BR> <BR>Or, just suppose, Joe
    Teen buys a new pair of Shaq-endorsed sneakers, and they come with the new Shaq
    blackletter font &#40;on mini-CD&#41; which he can use in all his emails &#40;or
    school essays&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Jim -- do you have the rights to Beckham&#39;s latest
    tattoo yet? Are you negotiating with Cristiano for space on his chest? Get on
    the job, man!

  body: <i>In a world of post-punk distressed-fontmeisters, says  <BR>Stephen Turbek
    of Razorfish, Diesel&#39;s work stands out because  <BR>of his range. Turbek says
    Diesel&#39;s work shows the mixture of  <BR>&#34;love of machines and ironic futurism&#34;
    that is emblematic of his  <BR>peers&#39; aesthetic. &#34;My generation is in
    the age when everybody  <BR>thought the future would have already happened.&#34;</i>
    <BR> <BR>AND <BR> <BR><i>&#34;It&#39;s a really difficult business,&#34; Turbek
    observes. &#34;When you  <BR>buy software, you get a box. If you&#39;re buying
    fonts online, all  <BR>you get is bits.&#34; He suggests that in the age of digital  <BR>distribution,
    fontographers might consider forming a union.</i> <BR> <BR>Seven years ago &#40;1997!&#41;
    when Stephen Turbek said that, he  <BR>wasn&#39;t a designer. He was one of those
    early fish that had the  <BR>&#34;billable&#34; people wondering what he actually
    did. Of course that  <BR>was a time when it was okay to have those kind of people
    on the  <BR>payroll.
