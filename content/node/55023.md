  upon this charming birth announcement and I thought it was a nice example of bad
  typography. First it uses the font Papyrus, which alone doesn't completely ruin
  this card. But the Papyrus announcement is printed on Mylar which is then overlayed
  onto a Curlz-like font reading \"Merry Christmas.\" The maker of this card though
  they were being clever in announcing the birth of their child and wishing their
  family and friends merry Christmas in the same card.\r\n\r\nWe learned in typography
  that type should be used to cleanly and clearly relay a message. The two fonts do
  not go together at all and to overlay them just makes the card messy and hard to
  read. What killed this card is the overlaying of two very ugly fonts to convey to
  completely different messages.\r\n\r\nPapyrus Watch\r\n\r\nhttp://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.alancaudel.com/papyrus/serenity.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.alancaudel.com/papyrus/2008_01_01_archive.html&usg=__Kjt-9CCww4pe_L5OR8LbaadtWRU=&h=755&w=510&sz=63&hl=en&start=7&um=1&tbnid=sfIJpfrWGCtbqM:&tbnh=142&tbnw=96&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dpapyrus%2Bfont%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG "
