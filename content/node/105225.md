  Engraversgothic BT regular and bold text is on same line as Melior LT. Slightly
  different sizes with same leading, no baseline shifts. I export as RTF file but
  in Word 2008 and 2011 for mac, the baselines of the fonts are different. I am trying
  to export this complex \"branded\" style resume and keep the styling. All works
  fine except I can't figure out why the fonts have different baselines. Driving me
  nuts. Both fonts are Opentype and using Font Book as I had problems using my Fontagent
  program. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Client will want file any day now.."

  body: Don't have an answer to your baseline question, but if this is a resume, wouldn't
    it be better to export it as a PDF? Or if it needs to be kept in Word so your
    client can edit it, why not compose it directly in Word? (Yes, I know Word is
    lousy for page layout.)

  body: HI, yes well I primarily work in layout programs and am used to all the wonderful
    control. I just did not forsee running into strange problems. But at this point,
    I'm spending more time fixing it to make something work.

    a file from one format to another there may be opportunities for things to go
    wrong, and apparently that's happening when you go from InDesign > RTF > Word."
