  body: "_MASTERS OF SEX_ is a fairly close match to the similarly named \"Lust\"
    https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/lust/ _R_ seems pretty well spot on. Use
    the leg from _R_ for the strokes on _M_ and _A_. Use the Didone version of Lust.\r\nI
    suspect that _MASTERS OF SEX_  is not a specific font as such, but rather is yet
    another attempt to make a sexy set of Didone letters.\r\nDon\r\n"

    resulted in a font. A student project that made it into the commercial world.\r\nDon"

  body: Let's hope they paid for a commercial use of the font, or at least gave Dirk
    credit. There's talk that they ripped off the overturned E from another designer....
