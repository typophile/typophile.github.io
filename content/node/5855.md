body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m writing a textbook on typography, and I&#39;m looking
  for some text-dominant storyboards I can use as illustrations.  <BR> <BR>Specifically,
  I want to show one very rough sketchy set and one very finished polished set. I&#39;ve
  been having trouble finding what I&#39;m looking for since most of the storyboards
  I&#39;ve found posted the web have been image dominant. <BR> <BR>If you have something
  like this in your portfolio and you&#39;d like to have your work included in my
  textbook, please email me.  <BR> <BR>Or, if you can recommend a good site where
  I can find the same, I&#39;d sure appreciate the info! <BR> <BR>Thank you very much!

    Publication&#34; <BR>class when I was studying at <a href="http://www.UIAH.fi"

    a rapid-pen. <BR>If you like it, send me your e-mail and I will provide <BR>an
