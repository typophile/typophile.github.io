  more helpful to my purposes if they resemble or were based on any roman typefaces
  from the same period. They are from the Russian futurist book Tango with Cows. I
  can post more samples if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nNot pictured here are cyrillic
  types based on Akzidenz, Boomerang, Calligraphia and Antique Extra Condensed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wedged_6601.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notrubens_5267.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nottasso_6520.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serifcyrillic_4862.jpg]"

    is good. I also thought it looked like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-miehle-classic/|Miehle]]
    which was a Benton design from 1906. Dennis Ortiz-Lopez's version doesn't have
    cyrillic, but certainly a metal cyrillic could have existed in the 1910-17 time
    period.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm looking to do a visual translation of the book,
    so every face I can find an equivalent of saves me the trouble of deciding on
    a substitute or attempting to recreate it. So for my purposes a cyrillic face
    isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if Romana had an italic? I didn't picture
    it but the book contains a lot of italic of the Romana-cyrillic.\r\n\r\n"
