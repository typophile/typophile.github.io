  you please tell me if this is just a generic typeface or if there's a particular
  discerning feature that would require me to find the exact typeface in order to
  replicate the type? I'm asking for the typeface of the 'body' text, the trivia on
  the wrappers. Though if you know the typefaces used for either the Allen's or Fantales
  logos, I'll gladly take that info.\r\n\r\nAny help would be mucho appreciated. Here
  are two pics:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fantale_4917.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2666198000_e291223ca3_o_5047.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much everyone! :)"
