  in 2001.\r\n\r\nThe original Typophile thread is still here: http://typophile.com/node/14283\r\n\r\nI've
  updated the look and feel, giving it a less rigid appearance compared to the old
  version. I've also developed the lowercase, hopefully giving the typeface more versatility.
  I've tried to retain as much of the 'character' of the old version as possible.
  Being an early test there's quite a bit of work left to be done.\r\n\r\nAttached
  are two specimens, one of the original from a few years back, and one of the new
  updated version. Excuse the 'cobbled together' nature of the specimen, it was thrown
  together in Illustrator pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nSome feedback on the general look
  of the face and comments on the glyphs/curves/character relationships/anything else
  would be gratefully appreciated. And if you think I should bin it by all means say
  so... honesty is what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/magnitude_sample_22feb07_5073.jpg]"

  body: "Much better. Kept the sexy foundation but now it's more versatile with the
    lowercase and more standard forms.\r\n\r\nI don't think anyone will buy the 'Q'.
    Bring the line down a bit more to the corner and keep this one in as a fun alt.\r\n\r\nI
    think the 't' horizontal is a little week on the left side. No other stroke is
    that short on one side of the vertical. Try just cutting the left side altogether.\r\n\r\nThe
    'N' is awkward. A rotated 'U' might make more sense. Or just a more traditional
    'N' with the diagonal meeting the ends of the verticals.\r\n\r\nThe 'f' horizontal
    is way too low.\r\n\r\nDon't assume people don't want 'i' and 'j' dots. It looks
    nice without them, but give them the option.\r\n\r\nGood move on the slashed zero.
    There are far too few of these around."

  body: "You might want to correct the \"optical issues\" a little bit.\r\n\r\nNotice
    how the vertical stem seems thinner than the horizontal?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opticalitites_6740.png]\r\n\r\nOf
    course, that\u2019s up to you, but I\u2019d fix them."

    body: "To be honest the 'Q' was the main problem character in the uppercase as
      it's the only character (bar the numerals) with a left-right downward slant;
      all the others have an upward slant which (hopefully) draws the eye to the top
      of the next character. I've drawn a few more options in the latest PDF.\r\n\r\nThe
      left sidebar of the 't' was causing problems so good call on losing it. It just
      didn't sit well with other characters as the left side sat just a little lower
      than the x-height.\r\n\r\nThe 'N' is drawn like that intentionally to fit with
      the 'K', 'R', 'X', 'Y' and 'Z'. Just having an 'N' where the diagonals met the
      top/bottom of the verticals wouldn't fit (in my opinion). If anyone else thinks
      it's a problem too then I suppose I'll need to look at it again. I do have some
      alternates for the uppercase (shown in the PDF) and a full small caps set drawn
      too.\r\n\r\nThe 'f' horizontal again was intentionally lowered to help the general
      flow of the face but I agree it's a bit unorthodox. I've dropped the left sidebar
      like I did on the 't' and comped a few tests together.\r\n\r\nAnd I will be
      putting the dots on the 'i' and 'j', I just haven't got around to it yet as
      I can't decide what form they're going to take.\r\n\r\nGoran, that 'C' is from
      the previous version so hopefully it has been resolved at least a little by
      the redraw. I drew it as a monoline face originally and was hoping that I wouldn't
      have to alter the thicknesses. If anyone agrees that it needs looking at then
      that's what I'll do.\r\n\r\nI was a bit concerned about the width of the 'r'
      so I've altered that too, hopefully not too much though.\r\n\r\nNew PDF sample
      attached (up there somewhere, 'magnitude_07_upd1.pdf', I couldn't see how to
      attach a file to the comment down here), let me know what you think. Thanks
      for the feedback so far!"

  body: "The 'f' horizontal doesn't need to be x-height. Split the difference between
    the old and the new position and it might be just right.\r\n\r\nThe new 't' is
    great."
