body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI submitted my poster to a Typoday competition, India. But
  seemingly not to be announced as finalist. Here i would like to share the type design
  (not the whole poster), to all of you. So i would like to get the commentary.\r\n\r\nI
  inspired by a very old poster to celebrate Wilhelmina Queen in Dutch Colonial era
  in Java. One best thing Dutch people do that time is they conserved our indigenous
  writing system. Fuse it with European style, ie Blackletter. So i do that again
  in the modern days. I hope you like it, and comment it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S:\r\nThe
  phrase \"m\u011Bmayu b\xE5w\xE5n\xE5\" is taken from famous Javanese proverb \"m\u011Bmayu
  hayuning b\xE5w\xE5n\xE5\" which means \"to make the beauty of universe more beautiful\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/javanesescript_3721.jpg]"

    would think. Its relevance is predominantly dictated by its prevalence and use,
    whereas Hrant seems to imply we have a need for it regardless of prevalence and
    use."

    thrive in diversity. \r\nThe value of a cultural artefact couldn\u2019t be measured
    on \u201Cprevalence\u201D.\r\nAs I already said, preservation is the most important
    thing: without it there\u2019s no sense of history. And, to clarify my first post,
    I meant the term \u201Cusing\u201D in a broad sense: the poster submitted by Gunarta
    is a way to keep an old writing system alive even if it\u2019s not generally used."

  body: I see its historic value, but when someone says we <cite>need</cite> (as opposed
    to want) to recover old writing systems no one uses anymore I question that. I
    must clarify though that I make a distinction between understanding a writing
    system and using it. I can see the relevance of understanding a writing system
    and mining the information within it, but I don't see how we <cite>need</cite>
    to revive such systems. Culture thrives on diversity, but there are also reasons
    why certain writing systems are abandoned. In that regard its relevance is predominantly
    dictated by its prevalence.

  body: And for the record, I do praise these kind of efforts. I only question how
    large the group is that benefits from it. I suppose you can't necessarily foresee
    that, as a writing system just might get in use again. Probably not a blackletter
    fusion though. But it looks cool in any case. I would love to see longer texts
    set in this. It might just convince me.
