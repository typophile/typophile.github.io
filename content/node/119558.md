  researching the use of typography associated with aircraft during WW2 and specifically
  the Lancaster Bomber, for use as part of the International Bomber Command Centre.\r\n\r\nIf
  there is anyone that can help advise me on how typography was used across different
  planes, how it was applied between factories etc. would be very much appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nI am looking at the end of this process to produce or find an appropriate
  stencil font that can be used to cut out of metal panels the over 20,000 names of
  those that lost their lives flying from Lincolnshire during the war. It will be
  displayed at approximately 80pt.\r\n\r\nSam Bartle\r\nwww.distraction.co.uk\r\nsam.bartle@distraction.co.uk"

  body: The airplane modeling suggestion is a good one, some of those folks try to
    be extremely accurate. I'd also contact the public relations folks at military
    bases, they might be able to direct you to a military museum or an expert in such
    things.
