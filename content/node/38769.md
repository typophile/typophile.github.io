  Any idea  if this is a font or simply custom calligraphy. \r\n\r\nSee the whole

  body: It's custom calligraphy giving the year that the ad was produced. I think
    it's really beautyful, in particular the M with it's details. I'll recomend you
    to have a look at the scripts from <a href="http://www.sudtipos.com/home">Sudtipos</a>
    and <a href="http://flat-it.com/Typefaces.php">Flat-It Type Foundry</a> (Lily
    Wang, Pansy Bo and Daisy Lau)...

  body: 'Funny you should mention, Richard Lipton''s Bickham Script Stephen, since
    I think that it looks more like Lipton''s Sloop script, which I adore and use
    often. I was just hoping perhaps it was from an obscure foundry that perhaps I''ve
    missed. Thanks for the help. '

  body: "I think <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg4.html\">Anglia Script</a>
    (top three samples) includes alternates that are pretty close to most of these
    letters. Also Canada Type's revival of Youthline, called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sterling-script/\">'Sterling
    Script'</a> seems close in almost all but the M.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
