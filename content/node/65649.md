  appeal,\r\nwant to open a long blog or forum about pneumatic weapons, but never
  with the board software and the blog can not define.\r\nNeed engine because of the
  blog and forum with the normal protection against spam, and then my friend found
  a forum filled with spam, and its already after 2 weeks.\r\nAnd you are a software
  engine for typophile.com use? Which script forums and blogs I choose to open a forum
  about air guns?\r\nI'll be glad to any advice, thanks in advance."

  body: "One of the most coherent statements I've heard here for a while.\r\n\r\nit
    reminds me of this:\r\n\r\nFrida Kahlo, (on Andre Breton and the European surrealists)
    letter to Nickolas Muray, 02-16-1939\r\n\r\n\" ... I had to wait like an idiot
    till I met Marcel Duchamp who is the only one who has his feet on the earth, among
    all this bunch of coocoo lunatic - of the Surrealists .... They are so damn \"intelectual\"
    [sic] and rotten that I can't stand them any more. It is really too much for my
    character - I rather sit on the floor in the market of Toluca and sell tortillas,
    than to have anything to do with those \"artistic\" --- of Paris. ... I never
    seen Diego or you, wasting their time on stupid gossip and \"intelectual\" [sic]
    discussions. That is why you are real men and not lousy \"artists\"...\"\r\n\r\nthen
    again it doesn't\r\n\r\npbc"
