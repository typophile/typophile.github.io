body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've been working on a typeface family inspired by different
  cuts of Kis types. It's no revival, but I thought I give credit where credit's due.
  \r\nRight now I'm doing some research into Kis' connections with Sweden (I've found
  correspondence that shows he sold type 1686/1687 to Swedish printers).\r\nThere
  are a few articles in Swedish that refers to parts of his autobiography, thus far
  I've found two misspellings (one is repeated in subsequent articles) and no correct
  version. I did find the book though, and if there is anyone who knows the correct
  translation of the title it would be very appreciated. It's not for a paper, I just
  want all details to be correct.\r\nAnd also important, does anyone know of any translations
  of this book?\r\n\r\nThe title is (unless it continues, check the link):\r\n\r\n<strong>Maga
  szem\xE9ly\xE9nek, \xE9let\xE9nek \xE9s k\xFCl\xF6n\xF6s cselekedeteinek ments\xE9ge</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
  since I can't seem to insert images I'll write the links to the pictures:\r\ninside\r\nhttp://www.sk-szeged.hu/kiallitas/totfalusi/apologia.html\r\n\r\ncover,
  reprint:\r\nhttp://www.antikva.hu/borito/1-54786-949.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nFredrik\r\n"
