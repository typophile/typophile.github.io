  body: "There are a number that might work. Some are more condensed than others,
    but all are narrower than the hand-painted signage in your sample. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D57%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DCORNWALLIS%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%252Cot.liga%26seed%3D25|Miller]],

    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/viola-bq/|Viola]] all have similar

  body: It looks like the OP may not be a professional who wants to buy a new font.
    Maybe Century Old Style in his font collection will do the job. There are more
    condensed typefaces like Onyx (ships with MS Office AFAIK) or - similar - Arsis
    (mine came with Lotus AmiPro/WordPro/Smartsuite.
