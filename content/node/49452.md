  body: "I doubt these ever started out as fonts, although you may now be able to
    find fonts based on their respective styles.  Try www.letterheadfonts.com as a
    starter for script fonts, or try 'Metroscript' from www.fontbros.com.  You could
    also try www.sudtipos.com - they have some great script fonts.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: JH is right. Custom lettering, not type, is the basis for these logos. <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/sudtipos/milk_script_regular/">Milk
    Script</a> has some similarities with Harrods and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/freestyle_script_by_itc_std_bold/">Freestyle
    Script</a> with Kelloggs.

    on an original logo from decades before that.\r\n\r\nMichael"
