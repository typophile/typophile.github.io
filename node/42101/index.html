		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey All,</p>
<p>Just to lend some credibility to this post, I have been working with Bai on some typefaces we will be releasing at Font Bros and Veer in the coming weeks and she&rsquo;s done some outstanding work. . .</p>
<p>Being that there is a steep learning curve to making typefaces, her talents in Illustrator have done well to bring a good majority of the drawing effort forward while I can focus on the production side and it has worked out well . . .</p>
<p>She continues to work on projects with me but has more time available than as many projects as I can have her work on so take advantage of her talents if you have a pile of drawings you&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;waiting to get to one of these days&rsquo;</p>
<p>Best,
Stuart :D</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Actually, Now that I think about it I have some questions.</p>
<p>It seems like there would be some downsides to not doing your vectorization in Fontlab. But the ones I can think of off the top of my head can be defeated - consistent relative size for instance.</p>
<p>What do you see as the pros &amp; cons of the model you have?</p>
<p>Would you given your druthers, have choosen to have Bai work in Fontlab directly?</p>
<p>Also, Bai, I suggest that you alter your registration to include your full name. It looks more serious trust worthy etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was going to respond last evening but my eyes were too tired . . .</p>
<p>So with a mostly fresh brain on your questions Eben, I think I need to quality the type of type I&rsquo;m developing with Bai which is strictly display work. It&rsquo;s not as dogmatic and exacting as what is required for text work but still requires a good deal of attention to create nice letter combinations that feel correct and are visually balanced throughout.</p>
<p>Now as to the Illustrator vs. Fontlab matter, I definitely prefer that Bai works in Illustrator because it&rsquo;s still generally a more comfortable environment for me to draw my own glyphs in and even if nodes have to snap to a 1000em grid, who&rsquo;s to say what &lsquo;correct&rsquo; is if the integrity of the form is still well intact . . .</p>
<p>I have drawn faces in Fontlab and still find it cumbersome and slow but I suspect practice will improve both of those things . . .</p>
<p>To your question about the pros and cons of the model Bai and I are working within, I&rsquo;d say there are far more pros than cons.</p>
<p>For starters, I&rsquo;m betting like every font designer on this board, we have more type specimen references and sketches than we may ever turn into typeface in our natural lifetimes and while I may &lsquo;cherrypick&rsquo; my favorites to take from top to tail, there are still some really nice specimens that will otherwise never have a life digitally without enlisting the efforts of a competent vector tracing artist.</p>
<p>And at worst, I can critique the work Bai provides me and in turn educate her to become a better lettering artist and typeface designer in her own right so I think it&rsquo;s a win-win situation all around . . .</p>
<p>I think I am a rare breed in the font world in that I have always embraced collaboration rather than tried to hold all my cards so close to the vest and try to maintain a solo effort. There are so many talented lettering artists, type technologists, software maketers, and licensing attorneys (OK one that I know :D) alike that working in a bubble can stunt professional growth and limit how far one can go in this field.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Stuart! Because I have become accustomed to fontlab at this point the approach was not intuitive to me. But I do understand how you would stick to the tool that feels most right to you. I occasionally wish I had some of the AI tools in Fontlab &amp; vice versa. But this makes sense to me now. And your final point is certainly an excellent one. Hopefully your &ldquo;type&rdquo; is becoming less rare.</div>
