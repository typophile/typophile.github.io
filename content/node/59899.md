  until recently). But that seems to apply only to dramas and thrillers and a few
  other genre. Comedies almost always have their titles set in red extra bold sans-serif
  fonts on plain backgrounds. \r\n\r\nA collection of such titles are in this [[http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1911773|video
  at College Humor]] (SFW, but don't count on it being so for other stuff at that
  site)\r\n\r\nIs big red text funny for some reason? "

  body: Big studios with dumb comedies aren't concerned with using design to convey
    anything to a discerning moviegoer who wants to know if a film is likely to meet
    his individual tastes. They demand market saturation, and they won't risk the
    possibility that one person in a hundred thousand <em>might</em> not notice the
    movie poster, or not be able to read the title, or not remember seeing it. They're
    pretty sure that to use anything more subtle than red on white is to take that
    risk.
