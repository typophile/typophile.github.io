  the basic technology behind OCR and it's limitations. What I'm trying to do is somewhat
  out of the ordinary ... I need to capture text off of printed pieces of stationery.
  Fonts, colors and background colors vary across the board. Ie. There could be a
  scripty, blue font on a green background.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of ANY OCR software
  out there that would serve my purposes? \r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated ...\r\n\r\n"

  body: not sure what your purposes are. . . easier steps. . . post the fonts here,
    some typophile will ID them at light speed, then either purchase or comp the fonts
    respectively from their sources. . . ?

    amount of text on each card will vary from 1 line up to 30 lines of text."

  body: "I haven't recently used OCR*, but when I did it was, at best, hit and miss
    on anything but the most basic text. Scripts, I would guess, are the least likely
    to successfully translate. For the time spent scanning, cleaning up etc. and then
    proof-reading and correcting it would probably be better to employ a copy typist
    to retype the items.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n* things might have (must have) improved."

    rather than OCR it all and have to go back and fix all the typos.

  body: "If you go to\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition\r\n\r\nand
    scroll down to near the bottom to \"proprietary software,\" there are a number
    of packages that claim to OCR handwriting and non-Latin fonts (for example, Arabic,
    Hebrew, and Asian). One of these might work on script fonts. Also, IIRC, software
    like OmniPage can be \"trained\" to recognize specific symbols, so you might be
    able to train it on your script fonts, although that would be mighty tedious.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    if you scan in black and white or grey scale instead of full color, color won't
    matter too much unless something drops out."

  body: "As someone with a lot of experience with OCR (it used to be my job to scan
    and OCR full books) I would recommend typing the text out manually, depending
    on the number of cards you have.\r\n\r\nOCR generally only works on 1-bit images
    (some OCR programs can accept other formats, but they're converted to 1-bit internally).
    For best results, you'd have to photoshop each card to make sure the text comes
    through properly in a 1-bit setting. If you're doing a book, you can just run
    a batch on the pages since they will all be quite similar, but it sounds as if
    your cards each have a different design with different colours.\r\n\r\nAlso, script
    fonts are generally harder to OCR, depending on a number of factors including
    how connected they are, etc. A good OCR program should be able to recognize script
    fonts, but that can get expensive.\r\n\r\nFinally, OCR will always produce typos.
    Sometimes it's just an extra period or semicolon if there is dust on the page,
    sometimes 1 becomes l, but I have yet to see a perfect OCR, especially from a
    colour image. If accuracy is important to you, you'll have to proofread all of
    your text.\r\n\r\nSo, if you still want to go with OCR, go for it, but I'd recommend
    a fast typist instead.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
