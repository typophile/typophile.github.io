body: "Hello, hi\r\n\r\nThe magazine's name is \"SALDO\" which means something like
  \"bank balance\" in Swedish (it's for the business students). Basically it containt
  useful info for students, interviews (sometimes with bigshots like the Swedish finance
  minister!) and other stuff that's relevant for a business student. \r\n\r\nCurrent
  logo is in Arial Black which has an added shadow and wider than usual letters. \r\n\r\nI've
  drawn some own letters that are meant to look like Arial/Helvetica but much more
  simple in their form. However I'm having a hard time with the letter 'S'. \r\n\r\nEven
  though it's starting to not look like complete crap it doesn't seem to fit with
  the other letters at all. \r\n\r\nI'd be happy with all help I can get. \r\n\r\nThe
  final logo will have the smaller text and line underneath it. Oh, and don't be shy
  to criticize the other letters and whole design. \r\n\r\nOld (current) logo\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saldo_logo_old_4511.jpg]\r\n\r\nNew
  (work in progress) logo\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saldo_logo_new_01_6064.jpg]"

  body: "Something about the S...I dunno....all the other letters have uniform strokes,
    and the S's variable-width strokes just throw me off...it also looks like the
    S is top-heavy, although that could be an optical illusion.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    for this application.  I would like to see something bolder and more serious.
    \ It needs more character.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Sorry i couldn't respond sooner...\r\n\r\nYou are all right!\r\nThe logo
    (masthead?) is very boring and does not convey anything but blandness, and in
    attempting to change it without altering too much the result is boring too. \r\n\r\nSo
    basically it's probably time to change it completely and try something different.\r\n\r\nYou
    will be hearing from me.  "

    i redid one of our old covers with the new logo (masthead) \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/082_FRAMSIDA_6376.jpg]\r\nI
    also provide the original cover to compare\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/082_FRAMSIDA_old_4725.jpg]\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: "The lines you have there now are looking a bit too 'newspapery' to me. Try
    taking them out and see how it looks. If it's too boring try manipulating the
    text itself to make it more unique. \r\n\r\nI do like that you scaled it down
    in size though. \r\n\r\nMagazines that are cluttered aren't magazines that are
    read. The same goes for marks and logotypes."

  body: "I agree with pennANDink about the lines, but don't lose all of them. Try
    a variation with fewer of them (but still vary the weights!). This version looks
    MUCH more dynamic and exciting to me. Good job!\r\n\r\nOh, and maybe make it a
    bit bigger compared to the page. \r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"
