body: "First and foremost, I'm really naive to typography. My interest in this subject
  just started earlier this year, so please be gentle on me. :)\r\n\r\nDuring the
  last few months on my extensive research about letter forms (before I started my
  2nd attempt to make my first font), I stumble upon the word \"Romanee\" several
  times on almost every article that I've read. I first thought it was some sort of
  style in type design. \r\nThat word keeps recurring into my head especially everytime
  I get my hands to work on my font. And now that I encountered it again on the article
  I'm currently reading, I can no longer contain my curiosity. So I searched for it
  via Google and here's what I found.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thechestnutpress.com/top-ten-typefaces.html]]\r\n\r\nSo...
  Romanee is actually an old metal (just assuming, not sure) type, and a very beautiful
  one at that.\r\nThe author states that the specimen shown there is his own digital
  revival of it which he's been working on for his personal use, which only means
  that it has never been revived by any type foundries.\r\nI don't know how accurate
  that revival is, but it's really a fine piece of work.\r\n\r\nFor such a beautiful
  typeface to be left outdated is a total bummer.\r\nI wonder how many more old typefaces
  of the same quality suffers the same fate...\r\n\r\nBy the way, the other typefaces
  below looks amazing as well.\r\nBut for now, my entire attention is on Romanee alone.\r\nSigh...
  If I only have access to the original specimen, I'll sure go attempt to make a revival
  too. ;)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n\r\n - Nate"
