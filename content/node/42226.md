  body: The spacing is tight because I still need to finish a lot more letters before
    I move on to spacing. Wonder where I got that idea? ;)

  body: Well your first four letters are looking effing fabulous. From a non-professional
    I'd say increasing the size of the g's head and in turn bringing it down toward
    the baseline might be a good choice.

    you have to space it closer to final to design it. Eg, is the 'a' too wide? I
    don't know how you can answer that without doing some spacing, and putting it
    into some words. Also the o and e would normally relate more closely as to width.
    If you are going to violate that you'd better make sure it works. And to do that
    you need to put it into words, and spacing will matter. As Mario Feliciano said
    to me: you want beautiful words, not beautiful letters.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    to make themselves known then.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
