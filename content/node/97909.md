  and so-relatable images. Here is an example of the font http://www.flickr.com/photos/76343955@N05/8165649985/lightbox/,
  or you can visit the website to look at the fonts used on the images.\r\nwww.teenagerposts.tumblr.com\r\nwww.so-relatable.tumblr.com\r\n
  I've looked everywhere to no avail so be great if you could help me! And I'm pretty
  sure it isn't helvetica or arial, although it could be a variation?"
