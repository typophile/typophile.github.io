    Gothic]] which had minute serifs possibly obliterated by the low resolution of
    the image.\r\n\r\nThe script looks a little bit like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/water-brush/|Water
    Brush]] from TypeSETit, but I couldn't find an exact match."

    Pro]].\r\n\r\nBoth of these have many alternates, so possibly even a better match?\r\n\r\n-
