  body: "Good thinking Kevin, Bauer Bodoni  does give a good idea of what we are looking
    for. Matching x-height, etc. I wonder what is similar but with teardrop instead
    of ball terminals? BTW, I suspect that the little loop in _R_ is a custom\r\nfeature,
    like the lower swash on _f_.\r\nDon"

  body: "Look esp at strokes on lhs of _a_ and _o_. Bottom half looks squeezed to
    my eye. After the hypothesized skew left is removed, by sloping the image right,
    the strokes look more balanced -- and BTW are a pretty fair match to the Bauer
    Bodoni Italic.\r\nDon"
