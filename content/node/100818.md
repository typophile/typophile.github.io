  it is the dates under the article titles."

  body: "\"THOUGHTS & OPINIONS\" looks a bit small to me under that headline.\r\nWith
    that much leading you might need a wider gutter between the columns. \r\nWhat
    would the dates look like in one of the serif types?"

  body: "I was trying to get the main focus on my name and then on to the articles
    section so I didn't want to set \"Thoughts & Opinions\" at a medium-large font-size.
    Basically that is why the menu and that title has a lower font-size. Anyway, I
    bumped it up 1 pixel and I think it works better with the menu already, what do
    you think?\r\n\r\nI also changed the date to Benton Modern RE, thoughts on that
    as well?"

  body: "I think keeping the sans to the header and footer looks good. \r\nIs that
    the default wordspacing in the article titles? For some reason it looks wide to
    me. \r\nAlso for your to-do list: making it work on mobiles:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_5364.PNG]"

  body: Yes, thank you. Everything will degrade gracefully on mobile before I push
    it live. That's for sure. The spacing between words is normal, it isn't altered
    in any way. The only dislike I have for Benton Modern RE on the dates is that
    the weight contrast between it and Old standard in the titles are too significant.
