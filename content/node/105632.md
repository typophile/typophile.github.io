  geeks, means days and nights filled with typographic inspiration, scholarship and
  debauchery. Unless, like me, you\u2019re not going to TypeCon this year. As my social
  media feeds fill with the hashtags, the inevitable filtered shots of Portland signage
  and the local typographic faux-pas, I\u2019ll be watching enviously and refreshing
  my browser incessantly from the sidelines. For those of you who are about to embark
  on your TypeCon voyage, here is some unsolicited advice on what to do (and not to
  do) from a six-time offender.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<em>On what to pack</em>\r\n\r\nDO:
  Pack a sweater. The temperature of the hotel conference hall is inversely proportional
  to the number of ampersand tattoos in the room. Bonus points if it\u2019s a [[http://marketplace.veer.com/merch/Kern-Zip-up-VPR0001260|KERN
  zip-up]].  \r\n\r\nDON\u2019T: Pack pajamas. I\u2019m pretty sure that sleep is
  not a part of the full TypeCon experience, so you won\u2019t really be needing them.
  If parenting has taught me anything, it\u2019s this: sleep is an optional activity
  in life and at TypeCon.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>On how to make friends</em>\r\n\r\nDO: Hang
  out in the hotel lobby or bar to make friends. If you don\u2019t know anyone at
  TypeCon, just listen for the folks foaming at the mouth about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Addison_Dwiggins|W.A.
  Dwiggins]] and mumble something about the tension of the curves in Electra. You'll
  have yourself some instant BFFs.\r\n\r\nDON\u2019T: Spend every break / lunch hour
  face-down buried in your phone thumbing through tweets. Starting a conversation
  with a random stranger is totally awkward but it\u2019s in PORTLAND. This is your
  chance to MAKE IT WEIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>On presentation attendance</em>\r\n\r\nDO:
  Wake up early \u2014 oh wait, you didn\u2019t really sleep, right? TypeCon organizers
  tend to cluster interesting presentations in the early morning hours, so set that
  alarm, inject some caffeine into your bloodstream and grab a seat up front. \r\n\r\nDON\u2019T:
  Skip out on late afternoons or Sunday. Let\u2019s face it: everyone needs a break
  now and then but don\u2019t make the mistake of missing some quality presentations
  either. Take advantage of those well-timed coffee breaks and the luxuriously long
  lunchtimes to get some fresh air, check out the city and let your loved ones know
  you\u2019re alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>On deciding where to eat</em>\r\n\r\nDO: Eat lunch
  and dinner with other attendees. Some of the strongest relationships forged at TypeCon
  happen over food and drink. Find some folks in the lobby who look indecisive, check
  out the [[http://www.typecon.com/download/typecon_restaurant_guide_2013.pdf|TypeCon
  restaurant guide]] and ask to join them. Most people at TypeCon are overwhelmingly
  friendly. And hungry.\r\n\r\nDON\u2019T: Skip a meal before the Type Quiz / Saturday
  night festivities. Just trust me on that one. \r\n\r\n\r\n<em>On signing up for
  the Type Crit</em>\r\n\r\nDO: Sign up for the Type Crit on Sunday. One of the highlights
  of my first TypeCon (2004) was the crit with John Downer, Akira Kobayashi, and Matthew
  Carter. I was a young grad student new to type design and knew *no one* at TypeCon
  before I got there. They were all extremely graceful and the experience proved to
  be highly useful, even if my stomach was in my throat while showing my in-progress
  work. That\u2019s what crits are for.\r\n\r\nDON\u2019T: Wimp out. You\u2019ll regret
  not trying. Also, don\u2019t steal the Type Crit sign. Not cool. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor
  those of you not attending this year, how do you survive the week? Live precariously
  through the [[https://twitter.com/search?q=%23typecon|hashtag]]? Watch Helvetica
  on Netflix? Cry into your pillow at night? \r\n\r\nHappy week, TypeCon! Make me
  jealous that I\u2019m not there."
