  body: I would like to know why there aren't more folks interested in type. It is
    an integral part of our society and culture. Yet, when I tell non-designers that
    I design fonts for a living, they usually just look at me with a funny expression
    on their face.

    if you told them you could do incredible tattoos with letters they would start
    waiting in line. Hmmmm... wait a minute, that sounds like a great idea!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/titanic-tattoo2.png]"
