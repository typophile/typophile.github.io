body: I am in dire need of identifying the two fonts on the image. Both the Name Above,
  and the word Punkintown. The former designer was unable to provide the font names.
  The upper looks similar to ITC Bradley Hand, just not the exact font. The "K" in
  Punkintown seems almost manually created such as via Photoshop, but just not figuring
  it out. Help! Thank you!

    companies like Brendel (Liliput), Fantazia Concepts (FZ HAND 6), ImageLine (Abera
    ttnorm), etc.\r\nThe original is probably <strong>Davys Crappy Writing</strong>
    by D. Rakowski (1992) but I'm not 100% sure about it.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nI
