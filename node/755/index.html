In most cases, free fonts lack the quality you would find in purchasing the font through an established foundry, especially if you're intending on using these fonts for professional use. <BR> <BR>For what its worth, there's a list of free font sites (and foundries) in the Typophile Open Directory Project. Most fonts that you would download would come in a compressed format, likely .ZIP or .SIT, so make sure you have an uncompression tool handy (Pkunzip, Stuffit Expander). <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sarah Scheer - <BR> <BR>You had asked: <BR>&quot;I want to get a font collection going for projects that I am in the process of working on now, and I need help.&quot; <BR> <BR>Not knowing anything about how long you've been around graphic design, or advertising, apart from your being a recent student (according to your profile here), I'd like to interject one thing, if I may. <BR> <BR>It's very important to have a budget for type that somehow relates to how you are choosing to run your studio, or how you might be a working designer within an agency. Or, a publication designer for an alumni magazine. <BR> <BR>A possible approach: <BR> <BR>1) Whittle down to a short list of which legitimately sold, commercial fonts that you might want to start with.  <BR> <BR>At an absolute minimum? <BR> <BR>Two four-weight type families would give you great flexibility; one being a sanserif family and one being a serif family. Ok, add one more: You should probably have at least one useful script font that you wouldn't be embarassed to use repeatedly. <BR> <BR>Each of the four-weight families would have a Book, Bold, Book Italic and Bold Italic. For flexibility. <BR> <BR>That might come to about $150 to $200. <BR> <BR>Too costly for one month? <BR> <BR>2) Choose one of the four-weight families, and just buy that.  <BR> <BR>3) Here's the only hard part: Which one? <BR> <BR>You'll do yourself and your client a great favor by using something credible but <BR>a) Not a System Font; <BR>b) Not a typical newspaper or magazine text font; <BR>c) Not something you see everyday. <BR> <BR>Quiz your client(s) on their preferences, in very general terms, for serif or sanserif in display and in text. <BR> <BR>If they express no preference, or trust you as designer implicitly (which is where you can get to over time when you do things proactively and responsibly to engender the client's trust), then simply choose what you like. Don't get too hung up with serif versus sanserif, to start out. <BR> <BR>The point is to start giving your work the legitimacy of using authentically crafted, high quality fonts. And to start right from the get go, doing something unique. <BR> <BR>Check out that the character sets are complete and well made, and that the fonts have adequate kerning and spacing that actually does work. Make sure the mood suits your needs, and that the numbers (figures) and currency marks and punctuation do what they're supposed to. <BR> <BR>You can simply e-mail or phone the type foundries and ask. They (and we) love to get questions from designers who have made type important to their work. <BR> <BR>Here's the surprisingly easy part, if you open your mind to it:  <BR> <BR>4) Get the client to pay for it! <BR> <BR>Within the structure of a project or campaign quote, the cost of fonts is very inexpensive. If you work with historically cheap clients, it will simply be necessary to take them through what you're trying to bring to their project or campaign through uniqueness. Discuss it as a natural extension of the branding effort. Which, after all, is true. <BR> <BR>Trust me, it works! But the responsible designer starts to consider the need for distinct, quality typefaces and build that in early, into the early strategizing and into the early quote discussions and paperwork. It's every bit as crucial to the long term credibility of your work as buying illustration or photography will be. And since type often carries where there's no budget at all for illustration or photography, one could make the point that it's more crucial. <BR> <BR>All that is a much more important consideration to your design career than spending lots of time that could be used for creativity, instead trying to 'score free fonts'. Much more important. <BR> <BR>Good luck. And don't forget: It's your career that you're formulating. Your life's work! <BR> <BR>Joe <BR></div>

Which is the kind of advice I was dispensing, in the case of my post: compartmentalized. <BR> <BR>An aside: Would it be less confusing for the group if I always ended my posts with my full sig block? (I don't because it seems to me to be too much for the very cleanly designed environment this list has.) <BR> <BR> <BR>&gt;And it's true that generally the for-profit fonts  <BR>&gt;are better designed and more complete.

Often impossible deadlines. Isn't it better for a former student entering the profession to ground themselves in known quality and acknowledged reliability first? <BR> <BR>(How to find out who's who? In addition to lists like this, design organizations can guide to quality type manufacturers.) <BR> <BR>Many in this group will likely have the tools to open up a font. And from there, determine by educated guess whether it might be reliably enough built to trust on a real-world deadline job with thousands of the client's dollars and your reputation, all on the line. <BR> <BR>But even if you have the tools, there's still a learning curve to really being able to tell. <BR> <BR>I don't mean to get into a big to-do about this, but it seems to me that for a person who's serious about a design career - and if they think they might want to actually advance to a stellar career - knowingly spending time with questionably made fonts is a counterproductive career move.  <BR> <BR>Just as you'd never want to commission art from a truly lame illustrator. Or photography from a terrible photographer. <BR> <BR>For the design professional, why surround oneself with mediocrity? <BR> <BR>Yes, for amateurs and collectors, there is nothing at all wrong with seeking out free fonts&hellip;as long as the are not unlicensed commercial properties. Have fun!  <BR> <BR>As in other collecting pursuits, starting by obtaining catalogs and then going from there to seeking out actual fonts is a more sensible, logical starting point rather than starting by scouring the internet everything that's free and trying to max out your font menu. <BR> <BR>Especially for the beginner and near-beginner, those can be overwhelming and confusing. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR></div>

But I was just asking in general, not pointing fingers at any entity in particular. <BR> <BR>I don't think font pirates - or those who believe that font pirates are some kind of godlike style leaders - truly realize how much collateral damage they do to the type profession. It's quite a lot of ongoing, serious damage. <BR> <BR>Could it be related to all the hyperventilating about terrorism? Sure. It's exactly that, on a software plane.  <BR> <BR>It destroys profitability and the ability to create taxable income to buoy the countries the commercial foundries reside in. <BR> <BR>Worst of all, the widespread, longterm financial effect is to slow growth in commercial font development. <BR> <BR>For all the development seen since 1984, there would be quite a lot more, and there would be many more staff and intern position availabilities at commercial foundries, if pirates were seen as what they really are, and shunned. <BR> <BR>Want your country out of its bad economic state? Think about the billions of real dollars lost to software piracy annually, globally. Font piracy, in it's corner, takes its toll and contributes to the bad economic conditions that have been plaguing us all for so long. <BR> <BR>As a newbie to the list, I was hoping that this list does not condone font piracy. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR></div>

Is Fred Nader still a pirate? <BR> <BR>The ethics of the type designer, the price, and the quality of fonts, are three separate issues.

Probably about 12 on Mac, a dozen on Windows, (and as an aside) was it 25 fonts &quot;free&quot;, built into laserprinter firmware? (Those numbers might be wrong.) <BR> <BR>Now, we might not like them especially*, but OS makers could have made fonts (even those mandated by the OS to be there) a separate purchase item from the very beginning of the microcomputer age. <BR> <BR>(Gee, can you imagine what that would have been like?) <BR> <BR>What would stop a university, for instance, doing a bulk license for distribution of a 'educational core set' of additional fonts to its students, to them be made available for download upon admission or on moving into the dorm? Probably not much, if such an idea were ever advanced during purchasing cycles. <BR> <BR>Maybe a program like that for higher education already exists somewhere. <BR> <BR>(*I, for one, am still getting over LaserWriter v.23's Helv.
