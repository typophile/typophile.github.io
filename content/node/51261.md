body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a geometricish sans that has display qualities
  similar to Futura, but has text qualities like Frutiger. Preferably available in
  a family with a range of weights from Light to Black, and presence of hanging figures.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"
