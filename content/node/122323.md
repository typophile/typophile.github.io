    this a page from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy? If you could provide
    more details about the sample (the publisher and publication date of this particular
    edition), it might help confirm the ID. \r\n\r\nNote that Paratype\u2019s Kis
    is a modern version of same style:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/kis-bt/\r\n"

  body: "Kis wasn\u2019t around when the book was published, but Janson certainly
    was. \r\n\r\nThe ink has soaked into the paper, so that blurs the details a bit,
    but I believe the ID of Janson is accurate. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure someone else
    will correct me if they think it is something else....\r\n\r\n"

    body: Hmm, Janson is definitely very close, but I am observing some slight differences
      between the Janson typefaces and the one used in the book, especially on the
      capital Q, W, and C, among some other differences. Is it possible that the book
      employed a custom face?

  body: "I\u2019m not seeing a capital Q in your sample.\r\n\r\nThe more letters/larger
    sample you can provide, the better the ID.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that though
    the book was printed in 1996, it may be recycling older artwork for the interior
    (publishing houses have been known to create a new cover and slap it on previously
    designed contents).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Janson_3671.png]"

  body: "Still seeing Janson:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Janson2_3855.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    I\u2019m sure if someone thinks otherwise, they\u2019ll post about it....\r\n\r\nGalliard
    also comes very close, but its capital |C| doesn\u2019t have a top serif like
    your sample, and the tail of its |Q| is longer and comes to more of a point. Then
    again, your last posted sample is out of focus, and it\u2019s hard to be sure
    about such details."
