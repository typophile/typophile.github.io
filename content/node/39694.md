  for German language? I've considered it for several projects now, but I think because
  of the germandbls it's pretty much unusable. I understand the thought behind it
  (long s + normal s = double s) and also like it aesthetically, but no one I tested
  it on could actually read it. At least not without thinking about it for a while.\r\nFor
  anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about, I took a screenshot from Joshua
  Darden's homepage.\r\n\r\nIs there an alternative??? I'm afraid this otherwise great
  font not is suitable for german language without one.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freight_6035.jpg]"

    to the <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.pdf\">PDF specimen</a>.
    Maybe there\u2019s an alternate \xDF for Freight Text, too, though it doesn\u2019t
    appear in the <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext_charset.php\">character
    set</a>. Then, the alternate Sans glyphs <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans_charset.php\">don\u2019t
    appear there</a> either. I suggest contacting the foundry directly.\r\n\r\n<cite>I\u2019m
    afraid this otherwise great font not is suitable for german language without one.</cite>\r\nI
    agree. This form is only suitable in an historic context.\r\nIf a type designer
    wants to include \u017Fs, then the best way to go would be to do it like in <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_meta_serif_pro_book/\">Meta
    Serif Pro</a>: as linked alternates, with \xDF as default.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ss-alternates_5479.png]\r\nF"

  body: "Well, \u017Fs is not \xDF, just like \xFC is not an u with a superscripted
    e and \xE7 is not a c with a subscripted \u01B7. Those letters have lost their
    original ligation contexts centuries ago. If Joshua designed \xDF like \u017Fs,
    it is an obvious error -- I would contact the designer and complain. \r\n\r\nI
    also don't see a huge practical point of putting \u017Fs as an alternate of \xDF,
    let alone putting it in the font if there is no physical ligation. If anyone wants
    \u017Fs, he will type in \u017Fs. If one chooses to make a \"longs_s\" aka \"uni017F0073\"
    glyph after all, he might consider associating it with \xDF in the \"hist\" feature.
    \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\n<cite>Well, \u017Fs is not \xDF, [\u2026] Those letters have
    lost their original ligation contexts centuries ago</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, I agree
    \u2013 partly. The \xDF \u2013 as a \u2018real\u2019, discrete letter, not just
    a ligature \u2013 <em>in Latin script</em> (i.e. \u2018Antiqua\u2019, not \u2018Gebrochene
    Schrift\u2019) is quite young. So, in this case, not centur<strong>ies</strong>,
    but rather only one or one and a half \u2026\_;\xB0)\r\n\r\nHave a look at this
    book, picked from what Google has to offer from that period (of course, most of
    the German books then still were set in Fraktur):\r\nJacob Grimm: Deutsche Mythologie.
    G\xF6ttingen: Dieterichsche Buchhandlung, 1854. (p. VI)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grimm-m_4478.png]\r\n<ul><li>einflu\u017Fs
    \u2014 present day spelling: Einfluss \u2014 before the 1996 reform: Einflu\xDF</li>\r\n<li>blo\u017Fser
    \u2014 present day spelling: blo\xDFer</li>\r\n<li>hei\u017Fse \u2014 present
    day spelling: hei\xDFe</li>\r\n<li>da\u017Fs \u2014 present day spelling: dass
    \u2014 before the 1996 reform: da\xDF</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGiven this situation, I
    consider putting \u017Fs (and ss) as an alternate of \xDF very helpful.\r\nCheers,
