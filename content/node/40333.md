    of the wine bottle might raise the chances that anyone here could identify at
    least the alphabet. '

  body: "It's a bottle of a local variety of wine from a basque town, in northern
    Spain.\r\nThe bottle is labeled in basque and spanish. I supposed that there was
    a hidden message there... a little joke perhaps.\r\n\r\nStephan, at the beginning
    I didn't thought of a direct relationship between the origin and the alphabet,
    but you gave me a good idea: could it be some sort of ancient iberian script?\r\n\r\nAnd,
    voil\xE0! I searched for iberian alphabets and I found [[http://www.proel.org/alfabetos/image182.gif|this
    one]], I made the \"transliteration\" leading to the same text in the line below
    the inscription; that is, the brand and its origin.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"
