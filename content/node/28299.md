  body: I think this is very well done. I would love to see some text settings in
    English though to get a better feel for it.

  body: The english text setting is much better. Personally I like seeing some large
    phrase, and single word settings on specimens as well. Take a look at Font Bureau's
    and Process Type Foundry specimen sheets. Pull some words that contain the characters
    you feel most strongly convey the spirit of the face. (Not trying to create more
    work for you, but I think it may help get some additional comments as well). I
    hope some of the type designers here chime in, I think this is a very solid face.
    There are a few things I noticed, will comment later when I have more time. Great
    work.

    should wait for Chris' comments before adjusting it though ;-)\r\nAny plans of
    making this font available?"

  body: 'Coop, I think the kind of advice you need at this point is beyond my realm
    of expertise (I''m a graphic designer, not a type designer). But there are a few
    things that I noticed. Maybe you can contact some of the regulars here directly,
    you may get a better response. A few things I noticed: the s seems to be falling
    over to the right; there is a feature on the leg of the k that doesn''t seem to
    appear in any of the other characters, almost an inktrap effect where the leg
    meets the diagonal. I like the way it looks, but I don''t see that treatment on
    any of the other characters; I think the o needs more contrast. If you can finese
    this a bit more I think you''ll have something very solid. I think it looks great,
    very open and clean, and I would use it myself. Great work.'
