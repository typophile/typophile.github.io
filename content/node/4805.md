  to let my fellow Twin Citians know that I have a very small part in a new play at
  Mixed Blood Theater on the West Bank &#40;no not that one&#41; in Minneapolis. I&#39;d
  love to see you there!  <BR> <BR>How does this relate to typography? Hmmm./ The
  hand-drawn word in the poster is Arabic for &#34;love&#34;. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.mizna.org/"

  body: Pretty cool. <BR>Also interesting in this way is the &#34;After Freedom&#34;
    movie. <BR> <BR>&#62; The hand-drawn word in the poster is Arabic for &#34;love&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Are you sure? The usual word for &#34;love&#34; is &#34;hubb&#34; &#40;with
    a &#34;raspy&#34; &#34;h&#34;&#41;. <BR>I don&#39;t know what &#34;gharaam&#34;
    means &#40;my Arabic isn&#39;t so hot though&#41;. <BR>Hopefully Nadine will chime
    in. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Thanks, John. I didn&#39;t know that forum existed! <BR> <BR>Hrant, I don&#39;t
    know Arabic. I am the token white woman in the cast. ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>We asked
    for the word &#34;love&#34; -- but I will talk to the actor who drew it for us.
    He is Palestinian. On a side note, there were several jokes made about the pronounciation
    of the word that were hilarious to the mostly Arab-speaking cast and could not
    be adequately translated for the few of us who are Arab-deficient. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Alessandro is correct. I talked to Ayman last night. He says the photographer
    asked him to write out words related to the concept of love. The word chosen is
    roughly translated to &#34;passion&#34; and includes both passion between humans
    and passionate attachment, such as a longing for home -- which is quite appropriate
    in this context. Sorry for my error.

    actually has a much more interesting visual form than &#34;hubb&#34; &#40;which
    is pretty boring - it&#39;s two &#34;x-height&#34; letters&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    an interesting coincidence: <BR><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3724239.stm"
