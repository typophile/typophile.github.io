If I remember well, I recall they said it might be an exact copy of the original but it's tough to prove. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They're not sure if the original was actually done by Garamond himself or his master Antoine Augereau.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My understanding of the people being burnt was not that it was about content so much as translating the bible from latin to a laymans language.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this is a Protestant myth, as is the idea that the Church did not encourage the 'black art' of printing. The earliest surviving objects printed from moveable type in Europe are certificates of indulgences for the Bishop of Mainz. Gutenberg's Bibles and the F-S Psalter were purchased almost exclusively by churchmen; indeed, you could argue that at the beginning the Church was the only encourager of printing. The first roman types were cut by Schweynheim and Pannartz at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->monastery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Subiaco, where they printed for many years before moving to Rome to be closer to their patron: the Holy See. During the spread of Protestantism, printing became all the more important to the Church, and the Council of Trent produced a huge wealth of Catholic publishing in refutation of Protestant teaching. I cannot think of a single time when the Church discouraged printing and publishing (although they certainly denounced specific products of the presses). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have yet to find any evidence of anyone condemned for translating scripture into vernacular languages per se. In every case, the issue was with the nature of the translation and the heretical teachings of the translator or the community to which he belonged. The Catholic response to Protestant Bible translation was not condemnation of all translation, but a substantial programme of publishing approved Catholic editions in the vernacular tongue, such as the famous Douay-Rheims English Bible which is still the translation of choice for many traditionalist Catholics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also when I was young sermons at the Catholic Church were still only in Latin.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When was that? To my knowledge, homilies have never been delivered in Latin to the laity. All the readings of the traditional Mass are in Latin, but the homily is delivered in the vernacular. That is the whole point of the homily: to explain and explicate the text of the readings, which many priests repeat in vernacular at the beginning of the homily, even though most of the congregation has already read the translation in their missals.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">[This is long, but arguably on-topic for this forum because it deals with the relationship of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to religion.] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald, my point about the Douay-Rheims translation was in reference to translation of the scriptures into the vernacular <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> publishing in general. Luther translated the New Testament into German in 1521, and the Old Testament in 1534. William Tyndale's first English New Testament was produced in 1525, although the first significantly disseminated English Bible was Coverdale's 1535 edition, the first complete English Bible. The most popular and widely read Protestant Bible in English prior to the King James edition was the Geneva Bible, published in 1560. The first Douay, Catholic English edition was published in the 1580s (for the record, I am not claiming that the Douay translation is a very good one: but it is the first English translation of the complete ancient canon of scripture including the Deuterocanonical books removed by the Protestants). And yes, during that 55-60 year gap between Tyndale and Douay, the Church did resist the publication of translations in the vernacular in general; although they did not, as far as I am aware, hand over anyone to imprisonment or death anyone for translation alone, but only for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crime<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of obstinate heresy.* <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One should also understand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Church was concerned about translation of scripture into the vernacular, within the context of an opposing, specifically Protestant theology and culture of personal Bible reading. Protestants believe in a doctrine of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sola scriptura<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that everything that a man needs to know for his religious life is contained within the Bible, that he in fact needs nothing other than his Bible. This is a purely Protestant doctrine, without precedence, and we should recognise the radicalness of it in light not only to the teaching of both the Catholic and Orthodox traditions dating back to the early Church, but also of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jewish<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tradition. The irony of this doctrine of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sola scriptura<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is that it is not supported by scripture. The Hebrew scriptures of the Tanach (the Christian Old Testament) presume the existence of both the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Torah Shebiksav<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the written Torah) and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Torah Sheb</div>

The very description of Heresy is &quot;strictly&quot; one of questioning teachings of &quot;Explicit Church Dogma&quot;. The fact that the Church and state were inseparable does nothing to relieve their guilt. Accusations of the Heresy came from the Church, Heretics determined guilty by the Church, civic workers performed the work of the &quot;Church and state&quot;. (Which were one and the same.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That was a marriage, not a divorce. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, if the Church had shared the teachings in &quot;mother tongue&quot; rather than &quot;forever persisting in Latin&quot; maybe these feeble minded civic workers would have questioned the little part in the Bible about &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, you have completely missed the point of my long post, which was to explain the relationship of scripture to the teaching authority of the Church as understood, at the time, by everyone except Protestants. The Catholic Church was concerned about two things: unguided private reading and personal interpretation, and the shift from sacramental to scriptural prayer and worship. You keep harking back to the idea that the Church wanted to prevent people from reading specific things within the Bible, while I'm pointing out that their concern was not the content but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->action<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of personal, private Bible reading. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not attempting to convince you of the truth of Catholic teaching: I am trying to clearly state what that teaching is so that the Church's attitude to private Bible reading makes sense. I'm not asking you to agree that the Church was right, only that their attitude is consistent and understandable <!-- raw HTML omitted -->without buying into the conspiracy theory that there is something in the text that the Church doesn't want you to read.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, there is certainly stuff in the Bible that Protestants don't want you to read, which is why they removed the Deuterocanonical books from their editions. Luther also wanted to remove the Epistle of St James, because it supports justification by works as well as faith, but couldn't get support for removing New Testament books. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So just why did the Church refer to printing as the &quot;Black Arts&quot;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Did the term originate in the Church? Where and when? The term black art is used even today, in reference to anything that is understood only by initiates. At a recent Unicode conference, one of the text encoding gurus referred to digital type development as 'something of a black art'. He was not suggesting that there was anything negative, let alone diabolical, about type design, only that it was something that the majority of people don't understand very well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[There, I've managed to get back to type.]</div>

The Church neither universally discouraged not encouraged printing: it was concerned with the product. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I keep asking for evidence that anyone was ever sentenced to death for printing or translating per se, but none is forthcoming.

This is anachronistic. The struggle to control the publishing of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->books related to religion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the early centuries of printing was not a struggle between repression and freedom, but between competing claims of what is true, none of which had much room for what modern people think of as freedom. It is worth remembering that a great amount of liberty was allowed by the Church in the publishing of classical texts and contemporary literary texts, because these did not deal with religious truth. The Church, understandably, took an interest in books that did concern themselves with religion.</div>

Some were whiter than white, others were see through and shiney. The Islamic folk had some pretty vibrant inks that looked as fresh as the day they were put to paper.

		<div class="commentbody">From the few things that I have read on the issue, it seems to me that the most controversial kind of Protestant printing was not so much the bible itself but of pamphlets and polemics.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is important to bear in mind that the Reformation and the Counter-reformation were not only spiritual movements, but also very political. In this light, if the printing of scripture had seemed dangerous to catholics, it might be because it threatened their institutional monopoly on 'truth.' Also through the centuries the Catholic and the Orthodox creeds had amassed a whole complex of text pertaining to faith, but not part of scripture, such as the decrees of the oecumenical councils of Nicea and Chalcedon, and the writing of the church fathers-John Chrisostom. I am not a religious man myself, but I think that the reductionist activities of the Protestants brought a type of christianity that is closer and more personal, a type which I would favour being instinctively wary of religious institutions like the Vatican and, to a much lesser extent, the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Religion and Politics, in my view, should be distinct.</div>

There seems to be a common assumption today &ndash; perhaps related to the widespread relativism in our society &ndash; that the Church could not actually believe what it teaches and is only motivated to defend the faith in order to defend temporal, material power. Lots of people believe that nothing is true, so find it hard to grasp that the Church actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> believe what it teaches. But the Church does believe, and it defends the faith because it seeks to save souls. Consider, if you genuinely believed that Christ is present in the Eucharist, and that anyone who received the Eucharist while rejecting this belief was in sin and condemning himself, wouldn't you have a responsibility to defend that belief against people writing pamphlets and polemics attacking it, for the sake of the man who comes to the sacraments? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reformation and counter reformation were political as well as religious because people lived in tight, hierarchical societies, and the belief of the local secular powers determined what religious expression was permitted. Protestantism spread in Germany through convincing the political powers that the new religion was in their interest. Max Weber famously theorised that Protestantism encouraged the development of Capitalism. Amintore Fanfani presents what I think it a more convincing argument, backed up by a lot of documentary evidence, that Protestantism was encouraged by nascent Capitalists who were seeking a religion that would not impose restrictions on their ability to make money (as the Church had done throughout the Middle Ages). So, yes, it was a political struggle, but this in turn was a struggle between opposing views of society, and not simply about power.</div>

Among Breitman's conclusions: 'Hitler distrusted the Holy See because it hid Jews'. Meanwhile, another Jewish historian, Rabbi David Dalin, has accused John Cornwell and similar authors of historical revisionism, and reaffirms the respect and gratitude granted to Pius XII by Jews after the war: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'Pope Pacelli was righteous among the nations, who must be recognized for having protected and saved hundreds of thousands of Jews.

Prior to that time, the primacy of Rome had been generally recognised, and had not needed justification other than what were universally regarded as such: the Petrine texts in the Gospels and the record of orthodox doctrine that persisted in Rome while the Greek church struggled with internal heresies such as monophysistism to which even its patriarchs were not immune.</div>

But historians gather dust and their job by and large is to protect 'Status Quo&quot;. They are basically talking heads giving yesterdays news. Almost all employed by &quot;some entity&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I remember the present Pope apologizing to the Jews for the Church regarding the last war. I had assumed it was about that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But their praise for the Pope surprises me. I have heard little praise from them about &quot;Mussolini&quot; for instance. An author writing for the, I think, (Jewish League) wrote a book searching for evidence to prove Mussolini was against the Jews. The author came up dry until at such point the Germans had over run Italy, about the time of the spectacular Alps rescue. (Quite the story) From what I could make out Mussolini was clearly the only world leader that actively worked on the behalf of European Jews. The others considered it either spectator material, or a participatory sport. But still the author gave Mussolini no praise. Even though he cited tiring evidence that Mussolini was indeed a true friend of the Jewish peoples. So in the end the author seemed to be satisfied by what he found in the later days of the war. Mussolini came up clean but was &quot;not&quot; praised. The author had failed his mission. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe that the author made much ado about the fact that, under extreme pressure from Hitler, Mussolini passed an act requiring Jewish peoples to declare loyalties to Italy. Such requirements are certainly not unusual especially at times of war. But duality is not acceptable citizenship in many countries in peace. Canada was far less kind to the Japanese in the last war confiscating the assets of its Japanese citizens and incarcerating them in dismal camps for the duration of the war. Only recently compensating them with a meagre 12,000. each. How many houses can you buy in Vancouver for 12,000.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It should be noted, since this is about typography, that Mussolini was a great believer in the powers of the press.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The press has had uneasy relations with religions throughout its history. Cetainly not just the Catholic Church. Protestants are not free of censorship guilt either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But back to matter of the Catholic Church, early Printers and dubious schemes to appease the paper God &quot;Money&quot;. &quot;Capatilism&quot; at its' lowest. It appears that if you were a very rich donating printer you could freely profit from publishing unapproved translations of the Bible, freely publish other religious materials including works on Luther. There were no obsticals spiritual or otherwise for rich &quot;donar heretics&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This particular printer / publisher seemed to print whatever turned a &quot;prune&quot;. He published 800 books. Anyone knowing the amount of work it takes to hand set a single book can appreciate how monumental that undertaking was. Those that have not hand set a book simply can not imagine. In any event he bequethed much monies to both city and Church. These buildings and lands are still enjoyed and the &quot;monies&quot; have not expired hundreds of years later. The Churches tolerance was well rewarded. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unfortunately most material I am finding is in Finnish. My wife has a Finnish bookstore. Gutenberg was uneasy about a new and improved currency generator. The old Indulgentia was now more prolific than ever. The Church was having Gutenberg print business class flight tickets to heaven for the already &quot;dead and gone to hell&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gutenberg was uneasy with this application of his invention. There is some thoughts his displeasure may have contributed to his financial woes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;I think this is a Protestant myth,&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the area of my personal focus. I have satisfied my curiosity. My conclusions are that the book I was given by my master was indeed based on fact. My book spoke of beheadings. Beheadings is consistent as method of executions of heretics in Germany in this period of history. It is coherant with the other material I have found including the time frames. Beheading is at variance to the original stories that initiated this discussion. However these other stories played in the back drop of other countries. As such, variance is not exactly, &quot;a big surprise&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That John is accurate when he says that Protestants were not without their own guilt. Certainly I have confirmed that. I have vivid examples of explicit penalities imposed on Finnish printers and general guidlines for printing absolutely anything at all. The most trivial printings were absolutely scrutinized by the &quot;Protestant Church&quot; in Sweden when Finland was under their rule. Even the slightest departure came with minimum penalty of one half of one entire years income from every printer in the shop. Penalties for this printing was imposed on one specific minor scheduled printing. The singlular exemption from the rule.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have not looked into the penalties of any other infringments of the strictly policed printings. But I am sure that horror kept printers honest. These other printings had first to be transported to Sweden, read, approved or otherwise, changes or correction made, returned to Sweden for verification before presses were run. Nothing, except the above mentioned single exemption, was printed without the approval of the Protestant Church in Sweden. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe in modern objectives of freedom of the press. Freedom of the press exceeds speculation of any merits of the alternative. And I believe that freedom of religion is a &quot;sacred right&quot;. Maybe, not so wrongly, blood has spilled over these freedoms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

The stuff about printing in Finland is fascinating, but I don't know enough to comment on it. I'll just add one comment in response to Gerald's final statement about freedom of the press and freedom of religion. In the 19th century, Pope Pius IX wrote that 'error has no rights', while at Second Vatican council confirmed liberty of belief. That these teachings are not contradictory is an interesting philosophical proposition and provides an insight into an institution that from age to age must change and yet remain constant.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodolfo, do you know if Carlo Ginzburg's essay has been translated into English? Also, does Ginzburg make a distinction between antisemitism and anti-Judaism? The Church has been, and remains, critical of Judaism for much the same reason that it is critical of Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. That criticism has often been unnecessarily hostile in respect to Judaism, because it has been historically influenced by antisemitism, but it is also something distinct from antisemitism. Antisemitism &ndash; hatred and mistrust of Jewish <!-- raw HTML omitted -->persons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; is a cancer that needs to be cut out of the Church and out of all societies. Christians and Jews are always going to be critical of one another's beliefs: ignoring the Messiah when he comes and following a false Messiah are both damning charges, and they cannot be swept under the carpet without distorting both religions. What I and many other Catholics hope will follow from the Pope's apology, and from the ongoing efforts to improve Catholic-Jewish relations, is that the historical mistrust and hatred will be excised, leaving a legitimate critical discourse which proceeds with respect for those persons with whom one disagrees. It is a difficult task to both respect a person and to believe something different from them about who God is and what He has done: in the past most people found it easier to hate; nowadays many people find it easier to abandon their beliefs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->'Historically influenced' and 'unnecessarily hostile' are a bit mild as a description of the slaughter of Jews during the Crusades and the persecution during the Inquisition. And the continued discrimination, invective and incitement in subsequent centuries.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But those are examples of antisemitism &ndash; and correctly acknowledged by the Pope as wrong &ndash;, and I was talking about anti-Judaism, i.e. of criticism of the Jewish religion. I agree that historically the two phenomenon are difficult to separate, especially as they influenced each other so much. But it is possible, and indeed important, to separate them philosophically in order to locate a legitimate critical, theological objection to Judaism and also to be able to condemn antisemitism thoroughly and without compromise. I certainly did not intend to be 'mild and gentle with these butchers', only to indicate how criticism of Judaism, which can be and should be respectful of Jewish persons, has been infected by antisemitism. 'Unnecessarily hostile' was intended to convey the distinction between saying 'Failure to recognise Christ as the promised Messiah is a grave error of Judaism, and this inevitably raises questions about the salvation of those who keep to this error' and saying 'Failure to recognise Christ as the Messiah is a grave error of Judaism, so all Jews are going to burn in Hell because their ancestors rejected Christ'. The latter is significantly hostile, infected by antisemitism, and the hostility is unnecessary to the critique; indeed, it is a distortion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, I'm not saying that the Catholic view of Judaism is completely critical. Catholics and Jews disagree about central truths &ndash; most importantly the nature of Christ and soterology &ndash; but they agree on much else. Ditching the antisemitism not only clarifies legitimate criticism but also will hopefully lead to better understanding of our shared roots and moral teachings. In this I hope you are right that the Pope's apology represents a turning point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I were not convinced of the divinity of Christ, I would be attracted to Judaism (although I'm mighty relieved only to be circumcised in the spirit). As it is, I'm necessarily a blasphemer to any religious Jew.</div>
