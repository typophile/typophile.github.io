body: "I was meaning to post this in late May / early June, but it's been a crazy
  summer. I graduated from the University of the Arts in May, and since then I've
  adjusted to my first full-time design job while taking some time to enjoy the little
  things in life. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, I was fortunate enough to take Font Design Lab under
  the brilliant Mike Abbink last semester. I developed a Humanist sans serif titled
  Agio, and I'd be interested in any feedback or criticism that you wise Typophiles
  are able to impart. I'm not sure where to go from here...keep tweaking? Develop
  a bold weight? Discover the maddening thrill of kerning tables? I'd like to start
  on a new weight, but I'm sure there's room for improvement before I go ahead.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is what I presented at my final critique. If anyone needs to see more to make a
  fair judgment, let me know!"

  body: "I'll cut right to the chase: exactly who will go out of his way to use this
    design? Formally it's a nice balance between grot and humanist sans styles (two
    highly ubiquitous genres) but even that's not exactly rare these days. So making
    this could be a great learning experience -and maybe that was your plan- but how
    much further could it really go?\r\n\r\nIt might be telling that you've been Abbink's
    student - I'm seeing the sort of genericity that Kievit exhibits. I for one admire
    a good deal of Abbink's work (not least NBC Universal) but even somebody who admires
    Kievit has to realize it came out over a decade ago (and in fact was started almost
    two decades ago).\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/95280#comment-518303\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure what to recommend - certainly slapping on a gimmick to differentiate
    it is a bad idea. I would suggest thinking deeply about how to make this more
    you. Formal education is a two-edged sword, and the better your teacher the harder
    it is to make your own mark... Good luck!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    he said. It is good work what you've done on Agio, but take the chance to express
    yourself through this design before moving on."

  body: This is not nearly humanist. Modernsit sans with a few humanist qualities
    at best. I like it, but it reminds me of something (don't know what) which is
    usually not a very good sign... The above two comments could be right. Cheers!
