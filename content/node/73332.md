  S is particularly badly crafted. I've included a sample of the business logo and
  was hoping someone could identify what this is a knock-off of. Any feedback greatly
  appreciated!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_6151.jpg]"

    The A could be simply modified in Illustrator by deleting the points that define
    the crossbar's left-hand protrusion.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    Alts is GatsbyFLF by the long defunct <a href='http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/d_h.htm'
    target='_blank'>Casady & Greene</a>.\r\n\r\nIt would still require the slight
    snip of the A's crossbar, as NJ said."

    for sale on MyFonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/premier/lightline/characters.html\r\n\r\nI
    imagine that the GatsbyFLF that Mike has linked to is the same one that Steve
    has been given.\r\n\r\nAnother quick point - looking at the weight of the sample
    above, closer still would be the Premier Shaded variant, with the shading removed.
    However, the Letraset Premier Shaded contains the \"R\" and \"A\" alts in place
    of the standard characters, but does not contain the lower-set \"A\" or alternate
    \"S\". Give with one hand, take with the other."
