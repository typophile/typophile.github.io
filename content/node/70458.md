  body: A number of Shakespeare commentaries indicate that "waste blacks" is meant
    to suggest <em>blank pages</em>, as you have undoubtedly discovered, but as far
    as I know it has never been a term of art in typography.

  body: "Yes, I am aware of editors who willy-nilly change the words and typography
    of the Shakespeare sonnets. One editor suggests that the tilde above the \"a\"
    was missed by the compositor, thus leaving out the \"n\".  However, because this
    is a sonnet sequence and each word has an integral relationship with the whole,
    I think \"blacks\" not \"blanks\" (which is not used any other place in the sequence,
    and \"black\" is used in several and important places) is the word that should
    be maintained.  I think the \"waste\" (or empty)\"blacks\" refers to lines of
    verse  (as  Sonnet 63.13 refers to \"black lines\") which are not satisfying,
    and I also think that \"waste blacks\" is giving a hint to  the missing lines
    at the end of Sonnet 126. \r\n\r\nAs far a typography and Sonnet 126, I was wondering
    how an empty line between parentheses was accomplished. I suppose a long spacer?
    I was thinking that perhaps there was some term for a spacer, as a \"black\" that
    would then be empty (of ink) and thus could be called a \"waste black\"?\r\n\r\n
