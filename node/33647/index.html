  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Andreas Stötzner and the German DIN committee submitted a proposal to the ISO 10646 working group that <strong>uppercase ß</strong> (germandbls, [[eszett]], sharp s) should be added to Unicode/ISO 10646.</p>
<p><strong>U+1E9E</strong> is the envisioned codepoint.</p>
<p>The proposal can be viewed at: 
<a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/N3227.pdf">http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/N3227.pdf</a></p>
<p>It is important to note that according to the proposal, even after adding this character to Unicode, the <strong>standard uppercase mapping for &ldquo;ß&rdquo; will remain &ldquo;SS&rdquo;</strong>. This encoding effort is not about changing existing application or even spelling rules &ndash; it is simply an effort to encode a character to be used in an &ldquo;alternate&rdquo; spelling which some people use (and currently have problems with properly encoding the text). It is an observed fact that &ldquo;uppercase ß&rdquo; exists, even if the official rules don&rsquo;t envision it.</p>
<p>I believe it is an interesting effort, and it would be reasonable to discuss what the best possible shape for the new character would be.</p>
<p>Some links in German:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.signographie.de/cms/signa_9.htm">http://www.signographie.de/cms/signa_9.htm</a> (published by Andreas Stötzner, I recommend reviewing all the PDFs published there.)</p>
<p><a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versal-Eszett">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versal-Eszett</a></p>
<p>Some German type designers posted some of their design proposals for an uppercase ß at:
<a href="http://www.typeforum.de/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=XForum&amp;file=viewthread&amp;tid=353">http://www.typeforum.de/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=XForum&amp;file=viewthread&amp;tid=353</a></p>
<p>I find many of these design proposals structurally flawed &ndash; they don’t look like uppercase letters. They look like lowercase letters enlarged to match uppercase. The graphical structure of the Roman uppercase is very different from lowercase. If one were to invent a new uppercase letter, it would have to stylistically match the Roman uppercase. If Unicode really decides to encode uppercase ß, type designers should imagine what the uppercase ß would have looked from the very beginning, rather than trying to work out of the existing lowercase ß form.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>history of &ldquo;ß&rdquo;</strong> is somewhat surprising. The letter developed in a two-wise way: as a ligation of long s and round (&ldquo;normal&rdquo;) s, and as a ligation of long s and z. The German language adopted unified spelling rules only in 1901. Before that, both in the middle ages and in the humanist period, German spelling differed much. For example, &ldquo;Thor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tor&rdquo; were equal variants of spelling the word meaning &ldquo;gate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sharp s was denoted by different writers differently (as ſs or ſz, which looked like ſʒ). The graphical shape of the ß ligature developed independently in these two ways.</p>
<p>This dichotomy still shows itself in a small minority practice of uppercasing ß as &ldquo;SZ&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;SS&rdquo;. Incidentally, this practice is understandable for most German readers (though not actively practiced), i.e. &ldquo;GROSZSTADT&rdquo; or &ldquo;MASZGEBLICH&rdquo; is understandable as the uppercasing of Großstadt or maßgeblich.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamt/490566363/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamt/490566363/</a> for an example.</p>
<p>One interesting issue is that in the <strong>1996 spelling reform</strong> the status of ß as a single letter has been finally confirmed. In the previous spelling, the general rule was that short vowels are denoted by following them by doubled consonant letters while long vowels are followed by single consonant letters. So writing &ldquo;met&rdquo; always indicates a long &ldquo;e:&rdquo; while &ldquo;mett&rdquo; indicates a short &ldquo;e&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In case of &ldquo;s&rdquo;/&ldquo;ß&rdquo;, it was confusing. Following a vowel with a single &ldquo;s&rdquo; always denoted a long vowel, following a vowel with a doubled &ldquo;ss&rdquo; indicated a short vowel, but following a vowel with &ldquo;ß&rdquo; did not give clue whether the vowel was short or long. So &ldquo;Ruß&rdquo; was actually pronounced &ldquo;ru:s&rdquo; as if the &ldquo;ß&rdquo; stood for a single consonant letter, but &ldquo;Nuß&rdquo; was pronounced &ldquo;nus&rdquo; as if the &ldquo;ß&rdquo; stood for a doubled consonant letter.</p>
<p>The 1996 spelling removed this uncertainty by changing the spelling of all &ldquo;ß&rdquo; into &ldquo;ss&rdquo; when the preceding vowel was to be pronounced short. Today’s spelling of &ldquo;Nuss&rdquo; or &ldquo;dass&rdquo; underlines that the vowels are to be pronounced short.</p>
<p>The uppercasing of &ldquo;ß&rdquo; as &ldquo;SS&rdquo; but also as &ldquo;SZ&rdquo; defeats this clear rule. If I uppercase the word &ldquo;Rußpartikel&rdquo; into &ldquo;RUSSPARTIKEL&rdquo; or even &ldquo;RUSZPARTIKEL&rdquo;, suddenly the natural way of pronouncing the &ldquo;U&rdquo; changes from short to long, so the reader is confused. The confusion is even bigger now, after the reform, because the special &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; treatment of &ldquo;ß&rdquo; no longer exists, so readers are used to &ldquo;ß&rdquo; being always treated as a single consonant letter, not as a ligature of a doubled consonant.</p>
<p>To remain logical, consistent and reader-friendly, &ldquo;ß&rdquo; needs (at some point) to assume a single graphemic shape in the uppercase.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that uppercasing &ldquo;ß&rdquo; as &ldquo;SS&rdquo; is now &ndash; especially under the new rules &ndash; a <strong>temporary anachronism</strong>. &ldquo;ß&rdquo; is a single CHARACTER (as per orthographic perception). It has functionally liberated itself from its historical background (which was a ligature of ſs or ſz).</p>
<p>Today, &ldquo;ß&rdquo; is no more a ligature of &ldquo;ſs&rdquo; than &ldquo;ä&rdquo; is a ligature of &ldquo;ae&rdquo;. The transition process from &ldquo;ae&rdquo; to &ldquo;ä&rdquo; has been completed about 200 years ago, and the transition process between &ldquo;ſs&rdquo; to &ldquo;ß&rdquo; is happening now. Encoding the uppercase &ldquo;ä&rdquo; as &ldquo;A ZWJ <sups> E&rdquo; (or something like that) would make as little sense as encoding the uppercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo; as &ldquo;S ZWJ S&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I believe that &ldquo;SS&rdquo; is an anachronic, still-in-use but slowly-to-vanish poor man’s solution to write the uppercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo;.  I believe that it should be an exciting task for type designers now to come up with a new form. In my opinion, this issue is definitely not one that is completely solved. We’re in the middle of a slow transition period for &ldquo;ß&rdquo;. The 1996 reform started it and showed the direction.</p>
<p><strong>I myself once had the idea</strong> that Scedilla (U+015E, Ş) would be most appropriate for denoting uppercase ß.</p>
<p>After all, Ş is historically an S with a subscribed z (that at this time looked like ʒ). Since ß is a ligature of either ſs or of ſʒ, uppercasing it as Sʒ, or, effectively, Ş, would historically make sense.</p>
<p>Using this notation, &ldquo;Gauß&rdquo; or &ldquo;Roßberg&rdquo; would be uppercased to &ldquo;GAUŞ&rdquo; or &ldquo;ROŞBERG&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Similarly, the umlaut in &ldquo;ä&rdquo; or &ldquo;ö&rdquo; is historically a superscripted &ldquo;e&rdquo;, so historically &ldquo;ä&rdquo; and &ldquo;æ&rdquo; are two different ligations of &ldquo;ae&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ö&rdquo; and &ldquo;œ&rdquo; are two different ligations of &ldquo;oe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since German readers are currently used to uppercasing ß as SS, i.e. they write &ldquo;GAUSS&rdquo; or &ldquo;ROSSBERG&rdquo;, I even thought of a compromise: the SS remains doubled but for added distinctiveness, a subscribed z (i.e. a cedilla) is added after the first S. In other words, &ldquo;Gauß&rdquo; or &ldquo;Roßberg&rdquo; should be uppercased as &ldquo;GAUŞS&rdquo; or &ldquo;ROŞSBERG&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Historically, this would make sense. The cedilla would here have a similar function to the trema in Spanish or French: &ldquo;GAUŞS&rdquo; would make clear that it comes from &ldquo;Gauß&rdquo; while &ldquo;GAUSS&rdquo; would make clear that it comes from &ldquo;Gauss&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ROŞSBERG&rdquo; does not look very awkward to a German reader. The addition of a diacritic does not dramatically change the reading pattern but still adds a distinctive mark that is, indeed, needed. If I were to design a glyph that should go into U+1E9E, it would probably look like ŞS, or perhaps just SS, depending on the style of the typeface.</p>
<p><strong>An alternative approach</strong> is to look at the existing uppercase-to-lowercase relations within the Latin alphabet and try to derive a shape for the uppercase ß which maintains the same relations.</p>
<p>In most of the middle ages and the period up until the 19th century, the long s (&ldquo;ſ&rdquo;) and &ldquo;f&rdquo; were closely related, &ldquo;f&rdquo; being simply a &ldquo;ſ&rdquo; with a stroke going through. The same, very primitive graphic relation exists between the prototypic shapes of the Greek letters gamma (Γ) and digamma (Ϝ). Since the minuscule &ldquo;f&rdquo; always has been a &ldquo;ſ&rdquo; with a middle stroke, then the capital &ldquo;F&rdquo; might also be considered an uppercase &ldquo;ſ&rdquo; with a stroke going through. Of course an uppercase long s never existed, but this relation may be helpful when constructing the uppercase ß.</p>
<p>Because I think that <em>if</em> the Latin alphabet ever used or needed another capital S, the preferred shape could be that of a gamma (Γ). This is a simple, effective shape that maintains a stylistic relation to the lowercase long s that is typical of other uppercase-to-lowercase relations.</p>
<p>If we look at the relations between Aa Ee Ff Mm Pp, we will notice that sharp, edgy connections in the uppercase are related to more smooth, round connections in the lowercase. If &ldquo;F&rdquo; developed into &ldquo;f&rdquo; in a cursive hand, then it is very easy to imagine that a cursive rendition of the &ldquo;Γ&rdquo; shape might, indeed, look very much like &ldquo;ſ&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is an important observation when thinking about the shape of an uppercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo;: I assert that the shape of uppercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo; must be &ldquo;edgier&rdquo; than the lowercase. In short, I think that the left part of uppercase ß should be &ldquo;Γ&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What about the right part? Here, I would call to exploit the double origin of &ldquo;ß&rdquo;, which developed paralelly as a ligature of &ldquo;ſs&rdquo; as well as of &ldquo;ſz&rdquo; (where the &ldquo;z&rdquo; historically used the &ldquo;ʒ&rdquo; shape, so &ldquo;ſʒ&rdquo;).</p>
<p>These days, the lowercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo; is typically derived from the ligated form of &ldquo;ſs&rdquo;. For visual dissimilation purposes &ndash; to strongly set apart the lowercase and the (new) uppercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo; I would derive the uppercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo; from a ligation of the hypothetical uppercase &ldquo;ſ&rdquo; (i.e. &ldquo;Γ&rdquo;) and the shape of &ldquo;the other&rdquo; origin of &ldquo;ß&rdquo;, i.e. of the historical &ldquo;Z&rdquo; shape.</p>
<p><strong>In short, I believe that the best graphical rendition of an uppercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo;</strong> would be be a well-designed ligature that incorporates these shapes: &ldquo;ΓƷ&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have made a small simulation using Garamond Premier (please excuse my poor drawing abilities):</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/germandbls_garamond_5881.png" alt="">
<a href="http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/germandbls_garamond.png">http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/germandbls_garamond.png</a></p>
<p><em>The first line shows what the historical origin of ß looks like, i.e. long s followed by a round s. The second line shows the current shape of ß as we know it. The third line shows what a hypothetical uppercase long S might look like (&ldquo;Γ&rdquo;), which is just a mental exercise. The fourth line is my proposal for the uppercase ß shape.</em></p>
<p>Andreas Stötzner has proposed an elaborate document that tries to explore all possible combinations of drawing an uppercase ß:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.signographie.de/cms/upload/pdf/Signa9_Kombinatorik_SZ_3.0.pdf">http://www.signographie.de/cms/upload/pdf/Signa9_Kombinatorik_SZ_3.0.pdf</a></p>
<p>My proposal corresponds to the scheme A1-B2-C1, which I has the most &ldquo;uppercase&rdquo; appearance of all those presented there.</p>
<p><strong>On a related matter,</strong> at the exhibition &ldquo;Neue Baukunst. Berlin um 1800&rdquo;, which is on display at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin until May 28, I have discovered a fantastic calligraphic lowercase &ldquo;ß&rdquo; shape, in which the &ldquo;long s&rdquo; part connects to the BOTTOM and not to the top of the following &ldquo;short s&rdquo;. Please take a look:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>» the history of “ß” is somewhat surprising. The letter developed in a two-wise way: as a ligation of long s and round (“normal”) s, and as a ligation of long s and z.« (A.Tw.)</p>
<p>NO! No, no, no.
We need to distinguish the ORIGIN OF THE CHARACTER from the LETTERSHAPES.
This has been mixed up by everybody for far too long.</p>
<p>The origin of the ß <em>as a character</em> is: a long s with <em>some</em> curl or swash or stroke attached, in order to mark it being not an &lsquo;ordinary [long] s&rsquo;. That attachment became randomly written like the ezh- (or 3-) shape by time (the same we find with other Latin letters for abbr., e.g. q). 
Therefor the letter became named “eszett”, the common mind thus just describing what he sees, regardless of the fact that the letter (the character) was NOT derived from long-s and z functionally or phonetically or in the sense of a typographic ligature. Note that up today “Eszett” is also named “Dreierles-Es” or “Scharfes Es” which indicates the very idea of ß as a character of its own.
The earliest sample of a “ß” in an upright roman-style printed German text (1667) is definitely no long-s_s nor a longs_z (ezh-shape). It’s something else.</p>
<p>The “ß is a s_s-ligature” theory was induced by the italic long-s_s ligature later becoming (ab-)used to represent the German ß. Today the glyphs we use in Roman and Italic for ß are actually two different letters (or glyphs) by origin.</p>
<p>A tricky history, admittedly.</p>
<p>But thanks Adam, for your elaborate explanations. Sorting out what the capital ß might look like this should be the level to work on it.</p>
<p>By the way, you’ll find it notable that we (searching for Signa 9) actually testified two medieval examples for the capital long S, one of them Gamma-shaped.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mark,</p>
<p>it is not like uppercase forms for fi or fl. The lack of &ldquo;uppercase ß&rdquo; means that it is uppercased to &ldquo;SS&rdquo;, but &ldquo;ss&rdquo; is also uppercased to &ldquo;SS&rdquo;. So &ldquo;SS&rdquo; is an ambiguous representation of two different lowercase combinations. This is particularly important in personal names: &ldquo;Peter Weiß&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peter Weiss&rdquo; are two distinct names and one may not be substituted by the other. But in uppercase, it&rsquo;s only &ldquo;PETER WEISS&rdquo; which is ambiguous because it does not exactly tell you what name it actually stands for.</p>
<p>It is a bit like the French practice of removing accents over vowels when uppercasing. This practice was introduced when typewriters came into use simply because typewriters did not have separate uppercase accented letters. These days, it&rsquo;s a bad ambiguous anachronic practice which is no longer necessary but still practiced by many French people who are used to the typewriter customs and actually think you HAVE TO remove the accents when uppercasing.</p>
<p>This also reminds me of another practice, i.e. replacing long dashes by single or (perhaps) double hyphens.</p>
<p>As I have explained, the method of uppercasing &ldquo;ß&rdquo; as &ldquo;SS&rdquo; is in my eyes an anachronism. It is still the majority practice according to official German spelling rules, but I think this is largely a technological limitation. If well-designed uppercase ß exists in fonts, and there is a Unicode codepoint for it, <em>and</em> (at some point) it is mapped to the German keyboard layout in Windows and Mac OS X, some people will <em>happily</em> start using it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popular use&rdquo; of &ldquo;ß&rdquo; in the middle of all-uppercase text suggests that there is an authentic need for that character. I believe we&rsquo;re still years ahead of widespread adoption, but I think type designers should do their best now to come up with appropriate forms, or at least once the character has been officially encoded.</p>
<p>Besides, isn&rsquo;t it fun to invent a new letter?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>BTW, in a font, the appropriate glyphname for the uppercase ß would be <code>germandbls.case</code> or <code>germandbls.cap</code> but <em>not</em> <code>Germandbls</code>! Should the character be encoded in Unicode under the proposed codepoint, a better glyphname would be <code>uni1E9E</code>, but I wouldn’t start using that glyphname yet.</p>
<p>In an OpenType font, you might want to encode the glyph as a &ldquo;stylistic case variant&rdquo;. To do that, do the following:</p>
<ol><li>Create an indentical duplicate of the lowercase <code>germandbls</code> glyph named <code>germandbls.ss01</code>. </li>
<li>Design your uppercase ß and name it <code>germandbls.case</code>. </li>
<li>In the OpenType Layout feature definition code for the <code>salt</code> and <code>ss01</code> features, include the substitution <code>sub germandbls by germandbls.ss01</code>.</li>
<li>In the OpenType Layout feature definition code for the <code>case</code> feature, include the substitution <code>sub germandbls.ss01 by germandbls.case</code>. </li></ol>
<p>If your font contains smallcaps, then in addition:</p>
<ol><li>Provide a glyph named <code>germandbls.smcp</code> which looks like two smallcap-S letters (the "traditional" way of making a smallcap ß). </li>
<li>Design your "new" ("true") smallcap-S and name it <code>germandbls.smcp_ss01</code>. </li>
<li>In the OpenType Layout feature definition code for the <code>smcp</code> feature, include the substitution <code>sub germandbls by germandbls.smcp</code>.</li>
<li>In the OpenType Layout feature definition code for the <code>salt</code> and <code>ss01</code> features, include the substitution <code>sub germandbls.smcp by germandbls.smcp_ss01</code>.</li> 
<li>Make sure that the feature definitions for <code>salt</code> and <code>ss01</code> are ordered <em>below</em> the definition of <code>smcp</code>.</li>
<li>If uppercase ß gets encoded in Unicode and your font has a glyph with it named <code>uni1E9E</code>, then in the OpenType Layout feature definition code for the <code>c2sc</code> feature, include the substitution <code>sub uni1E9E by germandbls.smcp_ss01</code>. It that case, you may also consider using the name <code>uni1E9E.smcp</code> instead of <code>germandbls.smcp_ss01</code>. </ol>
<p>It just occured to me that another approach to the uppercase ß might also be feasible (again, sorry for the imperfect color of the strokes): 
<img src="/images/old-images/germandbls_garamond2_5760.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This alternative treatment is analogical to the alternative treatment of the &ldquo;J&rdquo;, which may reside on the baseline or descend below it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You can see a lot of stuff in Germany, where people put in a lowercase-ß  when using All Caps, like ROßMANN and such. There is surely a need for it, especially for names. It&rsquo;s different, if you called ie Heike Rossmann or Heike Roßmann. Written in All Caps, it is impossible to know, if it&rsquo;s Rossmann or Roßmann.
But the Versal-ß has no common known form yet. If there would be a typeface with Versal-ß included, would i, as a designer, use this Versal-ß or the common &ldquo;SS&rdquo;? I think, i would use the &ldquo;SS&rdquo; to play save. Ok, it really depends on how obvious is the connection between the Versal-ß and the common lowercase ß.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you Adam for this very elaborate and profound thesis of ways to find a design for a new UC Germandbls. This is the best thread i have read on this topic so far. There are very hot discussions in Germany about wether or not it makes sense to include this character.</p>
<p>As nice as it would be to <em>invent</em> a new character (i am convinced of your examples of the Gamma-S ligature), i find the S-cedilla followed by S solution very plausible.</p>
<p>My concern is: if the knowledge of the inclusion of an UC Germandbls into Unicode is spread everywhere i fear that some commission will determine what that character has to look like. The S-cedilla proposal is very easy and fast to determine as standard (and it would follow the convention to capitalize <em>ß</em> by <em>SS</em>). Also there would be no need to update fonts. This could be taken up into the orthography (and the Duden) immediately.</p>
<p>That’s my pragmatic view. A new character might come up in a disaster as it happened with the Euro (if some commission sets up the design guides) or it will take a very long time until there is a form for the new character that will be widely accepted. I absolutely agree that a new character has to follow the forms and origins of the Roman alphabet (which are the preceding Greek letters).
It also could all end up in a design competition (hope not!)</p>
<p>Thank you Andreas for an update of this character’s tricky history.</p>

<p>Sorry gents, but this consideration was under discussion already 1903 and again 1956.
Forget about it. The common German reader-writer Herr WEIßMANN will *never accept a S-cedilla in his name. 
And as to the Euro-sign: yes, the commission did a dreadful job, like commission tend to do. But today, since the character is “free”, we have fonts with lots of fairly well-designed Euro’s.</p>

<p>If you want to do something for the general public, forget it. How many people in Germany think the ß doesn’t exist anymore anyway? They thought it was banned with the last spelling reform.</p>
<p>I think the UC-ß should be designed with the above mentioned roots in mind and not what Herr WEIßMANN likes. He was never used to see anything else than the ß in his name. But there are more important spelling situations where this character changes meaning (Maße and Masse, e.g.). So please forget the WEIßMANNS and the like. It doesn’t change the meaning of their name nor does it change its intonation.
My two cents.</p>

In your examples it’s only about intonation but not meaning. Roß or Ross is generally short and it means horse. A ro:s doesn‘t exist, as far as i know. Could be short for Rose which is a rose, hence it would be ROSBERG.</p>
<p>I was only saying that in names it occurs to me that there is a favour towards a UC-ß only for aesthetic reasons. To denote different pronounciation a S-cedilla would do perfectly well. I am not against a new letter, i only try to be pragmatic and the cedilla does make sense in the historical and formal context.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I start with the caution that I was not involved in the implementation of the German spelling reform and that I am not an expert in this matter. However, having been a tutor at the German spelling reform publishing house DUDEN for nearly a quarter of a century, I occassionally had discussions with the editors of the spelling reform rule books.</p>
<p>I am under the impression that both Mr. Twardoch and Mr. Stötzner missed the crucial point concerning the s rules. The &ldquo;long/short&rdquo;-vowel rule as stated by Mr. Twardoch does not reflect the full rule, because the full rule distinguishes between surd (voiceless) and sonant (voiced) s sounds, i.e. the spelling depends on whether the s sound is surd or sonant.</p>
<p>The IPA chart was quoted by me in another context on my website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/deutsch/ipa_sans.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/deutsch/ipa_sans.pdf</a></p>
<p>On page 2 of this PDF, in the top chart &ldquo;consonants&rdquo;, row &ldquo;fricatives&rdquo;, the surd s sounds are to the left and the sonant s sounds are to the right.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;alveolar&rdquo; column, the surd s is &ldquo;s&rdquo; as IPA symbol, and the sonant s is &ldquo;z&rdquo; as IPA symbol.</p>
<p>While some languages, e.g. Sanskrit, do not have sonant (voiced) s sounds, German (and also English) have both voiceless and voiced s sounds. Therefore, in such words as e.g. &ldquo;Ruß&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nuß&rdquo;, we must examine two things:</p>
<p>Firstly, is the preceding vowel sound short or long?
Secondly, is the following s sound sonant or surd?</p>
<p>Mr. Twardoch considered the first question and omitted the second question. However the full rule states (I translate &ldquo;DUDEN&rdquo;, 24th edition 2006, page 94):</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the voiceless s sound after long vowel or diphthong, the spelling is &ldquo;ß&rdquo;, provided that the s sound in all inflectional forms remains voiceless and no other consonant follows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since proper names (see e.g. English &ldquo;Smith, Smyth&rdquo;) often disregard spelling rules, the matter is highly tricky, and I doubt whether the Unicode committee ever examined what sound (voiceless, voiced) is to be defined by the proposed &ldquo;uppercase ß&rdquo;, considering that neither Mr. Twardoch nor Mr. Stötzner mention the tricky phonetical implications stated above.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adam, I echo Hrant&rsquo;s comment on quality of discussion. I found your writing lucid and really interesting. Thanks for the time you have taken on this.</p>
<p><em>These days, the lowercase “ß” is typically derived from the ligated form of “ſs”. For visual dissimilation purposes — to strongly set apart the lowercase and the (new) uppercase “ß” I would derive the uppercase “ß” from a ligation of the hypothetical uppercase “ſ” (i.e. “Γ”) and the shape of “the other” origin of “ß”, i.e. of the historical “Z” shape.</p>
<p>In short, I believe that the best graphical rendition of an uppercase “ß” would be be a well-designed ligature that incorporates these shapes: “ΓƷ”</em></p>
<p>Yes but if I want my C and c to look similar, and my S and s, and my O and o, etc why would I want my U/c ß to be different in design derivation from its lower case counterpart? i.e. if you&rsquo;re going to use s for derivation of ß then shouldn&rsquo;t you be using S for derivation of u/c ß? Is visual dissimilation (between upper and lower cases at least) necessary in a font? (It probably depends what the font&rsquo;s going to be used for which is a whole different discussion.)</p>
<p>Andreas: your pdf is excellent. It appeals to me that there are people that are willing to do lots of very hard work and then generously share the results with all for free.</p>
<p>My personal view is that the Γ approach makes it look like an uppercase character (whatever that looks like - it&rsquo;s very subjective) more so than the long s/inverted U approach. That is not to say that I&rsquo;ll use the Γ approach if it doesn&rsquo;t suit the rest of the font. The u/c ß is certainly not going to be a fundamental character which shapes the rest of the font.</p>
<p>But nobody&rsquo;s seriously going to tell me <em>which actual design</em> to use in my own font? Are they?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve surely got to do what suits the font best and, as with all fonts, there are going to be some u/c ß&rsquo;s which are totally different from others because there are fonts which themselves are totally different. This reflects the diversity of man and the wisdom of his Creator.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to know anything about the history of type, derivation of characters especially German ones, German pronunciation and the like. Nevertheless, a bigger principle is at stake:</p>
<p>Individual &lsquo;interpretation&rsquo; of character forms is surely one of the things that makes a font great. That&rsquo;s probably why some of us were so hacked off by being told what the euro symbol should look like - in every font! The thought that a designer must, in any measure, <em>comply</em> is abhorrent to me.</p>
<p>Provided my font can be &lsquo;read&rsquo; (whatever that word means - one person reads very differently from the next), then it can look like anything I please, can&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I guess the real art is designing a font that can be read well by as many different types of reader. And unfortunately, when it comes to the real art is designing a font, I&rsquo;m well out of my depth.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The handwriting practice for ß by contemporary writers allows both &ldquo;IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;I3&rdquo; structures. The S shape is more flowy, cursive, written in nature than the 3 shape, which is more constructed, drawn. The uppercase-vs-lowercase contrast is exactly about that: drawn vs. written. Pretty much all of Latin uppercase has very simple, basic forms stitched together, which are easy to construct and draw. &ldquo;S&rdquo; is the by far most complex form within the basic scheme.</p>
<p>Combining a complex &ldquo;long s&rdquo; skeleton with an equally complex &ldquo;S&rdquo; skeleton is an overkill for a letter. It starts looking like a horribly complex character such as &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;, which practically no-one can write properly.</p>
<p>I assert that letters must be simple. Uppercase letters must be simpler in skeleton than lowercase, because that is their very nature. Also, uppercase forms should be solid, strong, monumental in character.</p>
<p>I believe that the &ldquo;monumental skeleton&rdquo; of uppercase ß I propose:</p>
<p><a href="http://typophile.com/files/germandbls_garamond2_5760.png">http://typophile.com/files/germandbls_garamond2_5760.png</a></p>
<p>fulfils the criteria better than the &ldquo;Dresdner skeleton&rdquo; that Andreas Seidel and Andreas Stötzner prefer:</p>
<p><a href="http://typophile.com/files/sz_birth_6221.gif">http://typophile.com/files/sz_birth_6221.gif</a></p>
<p>The Dresdner form lacks something sturdy, defined, at their top-left. It simply looks like it is half-way between uppercase and lowercase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is visual dissimilation (between upper and 
lower cases at least) necessary in a font?</p>

<p>Of course, within a reasonable range.</p>

<p>Ps. Edit: I meant &ldquo;Dresdner form&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Leipziger form&rdquo;, i.e. I meant the form that Andreas Stötzner included in his DIN/ISO/Unicode proposal (first link in my first posting).</p>

<p>Unicode does not need to deal with phonetics. The uppercase ß character is for people who wish to unmistakengly represent the lowercase ß in an uppercase context. There are defined rules for the use of lowercase ß, and there is no need to explain them in the Unicode standard or anywhere near that context.</p>
<p>The phonetic rules I described in my original posting are, of course, simplified. I did not deal with &ldquo;s&rdquo; that is pronounced like the English &ldquo;z&rdquo; (sonor). In fact, I did not mention single &ldquo;s&rdquo; at all, because in German, the rules of its use are actually fairly complex. What I wrote about is the difference between &ldquo;ß&rdquo; and &ldquo;ss&rdquo;, which both stand for a voiceless &ldquo;s&rdquo; sound.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to read that in a detrimental way. I think the ideal is that letters are no simpler than readers can handle (which too often they are, like in the lc &ldquo;el&rdquo;) otherwise you&rsquo;re reducing differentiation for no reason. Sure, maybe Chinese is too complex, but to me Latin is clearly too simple, and when given an opportunity to add a character to it we should diversify, not solidify.</p>
<p>As for what structure I prefer, I do tend to agree that your structure is better than that of Seidel &amp; Stötzner, but Jason is right that the actual design on hand will always have a lot to do with it.</p>

To the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of the upper left corner, (make it true uppercase like a Γ or more round) is not a significant issue for me. Both approaches can work!
To me, Adams favorite shape is a derivate of the Dresdner shape like we have done it for our GTF typefaces. 
I like the Leipziger shape too. It depends on the nature of the project which one I would prefer. The Leipziger shape is more complicated and usefull for some delicate titlings or for more calligraphic styles. The Dresdner shape I prefer for everyday typefaces.</p>

<p>Why not? Most readers on the planet know neither German nor Greek. Yet we expect them to know the difference between betas and Eszetts. When I was doing corporate design work in Washington, DC, we had to disguise a lot of the companies who we researched. So instead of publishing a report on Acme, Inc., we called them Beta Corporation, or something like that. Readers of our reports knew who we were talking about, but we didn&rsquo;t name names without permission.</p>
<p>Anyway, the authors I worked with always thought that it would be clever for the first letter of Beta Corporation&rsquo;s name to be an actual beta, rather than a b. But their fonts did not have betas in them, or they didn&rsquo;t know how to input a beta. So they just write ß (ßeta Corporation). Most of them thought that the ß actually was a beta anyway. Good luck trying to educate them to see around that one ;-)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a completely different thing. Expectations play a big role in reading texts.  So when you write ßeta you suggest this way of reading.
Of course people could be confused with ß vs. β when placed as a single letter. But in this discussion of a capital Eszett in proper names this really isn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>

<p>My hat is off to Adam like eveeryone else for introducing the thread and his highly lucid text on the subject, but to my eye the samples he gave feel cyrillic rather than latin which Ralph &amp; Andreas' do not. And I think German aught to feel mostly latin - even in a glyph such as this. I do like the fact that he showed some descenders though.</p>

<p>In the sense that a &lsquo;new&rsquo; glyph should be &lsquo;on the team&rsquo; and not stand out particularly much when used. Then yes. Entirely. In the sense that it should extend naturally from the historical German culture of letters. Again yes.</p>
<p>In the sense that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Germaness&rsquo; as an essence needs somehow to measured - then no.</p>
<p>Actually, I had been wondering if anybody would confuse my statement as being anti-blackletter. It wasn&rsquo;t. (There is a false but long held historical/cultural dichotomy of Roman/Latin vs. Blackletter/Fraktur) But actually what I meant by Latin was this visual/cultural continuity and the reality of intercultural pentration via loan words etc.</p>
<p>And in fact one great way to give consideration to a form might be to try to write it out in the various blackletter styles: Textura, Bastarda, Schwabacher, Fraktur, Burgundica, etc, to see what happens. BTW, I am also not suggesting that direct continuity of form from the Sans serif to the Blackletter would be desirable either. Looking at Fette Fraktur&rsquo;s C,L, and S certainly suggest the opposite might be true.</p>
<p>When I think about this letter it seems like the top 3 purposes would be :</p>
<ul>
<li>Monuments in a Trajanesque mould,</li>
<li>Signs in a Sans Serif style,</li>
<li>and things like Pickle Jars ( packaging )</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; Admittedly tattoos and the back windows of pickup trucks might be candidates as well but I am less worried about those applications.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At Hrant&rsquo;s request, here&rsquo;s the text of a message regarding the uppercase eszett that I sent to the ATypI discussion list. I should note that I originally opposed the encoding of the new character in Unicode, arguing that it could be implemented as a ligature of SS, with a plain text distinction made using the Combing Grapheme Joiner control character. I still think that good arguments can be made in favour of such an encoding &ndash; for instance, it enables documents to be backwards compatible with older fonts that do not support the uppercase eszett glyph &ndash;, but on the whole I&rsquo;ve accepted Andreas Stötzner and, especially, Asmus Freytag&rsquo;s reasoning in favour of the proposed encoding.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hrant thought the following was a good synopsis of the matter, offered here as a contribution to the understanding of how we came to be where we are: wondering what this thing should look like.</p>
<p><em>A few comments about the proposed uppercase eszett character:</p>
<p>This has been proposed to ISO 10646 (and hence Unicode) by DIN, so the likelihood of it being accepted for encoding is very high. Since it is a German character, with no implications for other languages, no one feels particularly inclined to vote against a DIN proposal. If the Germans determine that they want this character, they can have it.</p>
<p>So why do they want it? Basically, they want it because at least some people are using it and it is considered better to have an unambiguous encoding distinct from SS. The uppercase eszett is not a new invention: it has been around for at least a hundred years. It has been used on-and-off by some publishers &ndash; notably on the cover of the DDR edition of Duden &ndash; and although it has never been enshrined in the official norms of German orthography it persists. As Asmus Freytag wrote on the Unicode discussion list: it is remarkable that something without official sanction should have persisted so long in such a rule-bound culture.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that at least some of the users of the uppercase eszett have employed it in the interests of alphabet reform, i.e. they want to see it become standard. Others may have used it only as a display solution for a particular piece of typography. For whatever reasons, some Germans have found a use or a need for it, in preference to SS.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be clear that the casing rule ß = SS is really messy for a nominally bicameral alphabet. Although ß began life as a ligature, it has long since ceased to function as one: it has distinct semantics from the sequence of two letters that it used to represent. It is a distinct character. The idea that it can be a distinct character in lowercase but not in uppercase is perverse, and causes major headaches in German text processing. The simple fact that case conversions in German are not roundtripable without dictionary support is crazy. Even if it were decided that the uppercase form of ß should always </em>look<em> like SS, a good argument could be made for encoding this as a distinct uppercase character. However&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;that&rsquo;s not how German is encoded, and the DIN proposal for uppercase ß is explicit that the new character should not interfere with existing standards for German text. So this means that ß still = SS, and the Unicode casing rules for German remain in place. The new uppercase ß character will exist alongside these rules. What this means is that any software performing case mapping between the new uppercase ß and the lowercase ß characters must do so at a level independent of the Unicode character properties. This is quite possible, and if the uppercase ß character starts to become widely used I think we can expect to see it handled in such ways.</p>
<p>The uppercase ß encoding is an interesting instance of a character being made available outside of the norms of encoding for the language in which it might be used. This might sound silly, but it allows this persistent heterographic letter to function in modern text encoding and display environments, and in so doing puts a lot of control in the hands of users to determine its future. It may fall by the wayside &ndash; one more little used Unicode codepoint &ndash; or it may, in time, become formally recognised and made part of the standard orthography.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may seem contrary that, on the one hand, the Germans have regularised and simplified the use of ß &ndash; suggesting, at least to Bruno, that it is on the way out &ndash;, but on the other hand providing at least some recognition for an uppercase ß. But it is easy to see how these may be complementary moves: providing a distinct uppercase equivalent to a lowercase character regularises an anomaly in a bicameral alphabet and simplifies case conversion.</em></p>

<p>This is an illustration I made during discussions of this topic on the Unicode list. I decided to put the uppercase eszett to the Trajan Test. In this instance, I was also interested to see how convincingly a form could be created that explicitly referenced the uppercase S for the right side. I&rsquo;m not completely satisfied with the results, and in general prefer the models I have seen with the diagonal at the top right, but some people liked it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Very Nice. I agree it isn&rsquo;t all worked out but the possibility of finding really nice forms is made abundantly clear with your example. I also agree that some added weight in the upper right - maybe a serif or a knob? - would make things feel more even. There is something about the diagonal that might feel more stonework like though ( less brushy ) and hence more trajanesqe. Also the diagonal feels strong and less swooshy.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, isn&rsquo;t it fun to invent a new letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>hmm. It is serious business and usually only taken up in the interest of a large and pressing need, (over 150years since an alphabetic was needed, no?). It will be expensive, and time consuming if we ever have to do it, which I doubt. But if I had a 1/2 hour to spend on it&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/upperSS_5890.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Make us sweat. Besides, a simpler way to form an s in calligraphic writing, truncated to the lowercase f form in roman type with an s ligated on and then blown up to uppercase proportions is hardly inventive, confusable with existing glyphs and simply not Romanizable enough with it&rsquo;s &ldquo;one-too-many&rdquo; moves within the cap ht.</p>

<p>Hardly necessary to establish a Germanic flavour, given the croissant&rsquo;s Austrian origins. They were first baked in Vienna to celebrate the defeat of the besieging Ottoman army in 1683. They are crescent shaped as an insult to the Muslim invaders: &lsquo;We eat Turks for breakfast&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;[Rue Montmartre, Paris]&rdquo; From the looks of it, in this context, the sign says &ldquo;Croissant&rdquo;, and assuming Paris is still in France and the French still speak French, (I didn&rsquo;t miss another Franco-German war Monday and Tuesday, did I?), then this sign can stay, thanks.</p>
<p>But more than that&hellip;I pine for the days when people knew how to make new letters: The migration of a lowercase to uppercase form is wrong in this proposal, isn&rsquo;t it? The migration from a long lowercase s, (invented for the lazy and rushed to improve the appearance of a difficult s to scratch), to an Uppercase F, is wrong isn&rsquo;t it? Following &ldquo;historical precedent&rdquo; from gravestones, sporadic bits of metal and folks with no apparent historical expertise or typographic experience is wrong in this letter, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Giving righties something sinuous and sexy to draw &ldquo;from their side&rdquo;, making a letter that looks something remotely like the sound, and following an historically correct path to a new and true uppercase letter — that cannot possibly succeed these days, I know. But making sense never goes out of style does it?</p>

<em>in which the “long s” part connects to the BOTTOM and not to the top of the following “short s”. </em></p>
<p>I surmise that the &ldquo;following&rdquo; short s was (conceptually) written first in the sample you show, That is the reason it connects where it does; &ndash; the writer just had to be sure to leave a long enough width in the entry stroke to accomodate the subsequent long s crossing it.</p>
<p>By conceptually I mean that the sequence e_s_s was designed as one continuous stroke, at the rough stage, experimenting with a pencil perhaps, and then constructed with shorter pen/graver strokes that were less likely to create difficulties by &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; into the medium.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say that in formal calligraphy, where design and execution can be separate processes, the left-handed (with suitably adapted nibs) face barely more challenge than the right handed. Once-off handwriting is a different matter.</p>
<p>Is that a reasonable assessment, David?</p>

<p>I think we are looking at an engraving here and not calligraphy. So, in an n-step process, it&rsquo;s possible anything could be done, as opposed to a 1-step process like calligraphy, where what you see here would be impractical.</p>
<p>From the proposal, Ehmcke Antiqua shows a design with 10 uppercase letters as lowercase forms. Is this not an unusual typeface to show when one is trying to make the point they are making? lal.</p>
<p>The next page of examples, all three designs in the left column show faces with relatively large contrast between the ii space and o counter. I couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;prove&rdquo; in type court that these are uppercase and not alternates or, that the compositions, (which place the specimen letter everywhere but with the uppercase) are showing me uppercase ß now could I?</p>
<p>All three designs in the left column are hideous as are many of the next set. And as I play the &ldquo;whole library&rdquo; ( i.e. everyone&rsquo;s), out on this form, it&rsquo;s a bad scene. Not the doing, though I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;ll be hard for just the German founders, but the designing of some faces where it&rsquo;s just not going to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the B without ugliness against the grain of the design.<br>
Show me a geometric. Mistral please. Heaven help the font with a bigger top on the S.</p>
<p>Another example, in Adam&rsquo;s additional attempt, &ldquo;This alternative treatment is analogical to the alternative treatment of the “J”, which may reside on the baseline or descend below it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But why then would not the first stroke descend like the &ldquo;J&rdquo; and the second sit like the &ldquo;S&rdquo;, i.e. the lowercase design? Afterall there is no &ldquo;S&rdquo; on this planet with a serif sittin' on the baseline like an &ldquo;F&rdquo;&hellip;is dare?</p>

<p><em>Perhaps. But people could do those things already (as I did in Hypatia Sans), while I’m not sure there was a good solution to the cap eszett until it got encoded.</em></p>
<p>True, but foundries will create strange glyphs that are characters in a Unicode group, as a basic font ingredient, before they will add other oddities that aren&rsquo;t Unicoded. The uppercase germandbls is, IMO, much stranger than lowered-umlaut caps and ck, ch and tz digraphs&ndash;these may be odd now, but they were much used not so long ago, so have a lot of period flavour. Of course, all that&rsquo;s necessary for ch and ck is for the typographer to kern them, but a discretionary ligature would be more convenient.</p>
<p><em>Aren’t you the one who was bemoaning that oldstyle figures aren’t encoded separately in Unicode?</em></p>
<p>No, I was wondering whether less encoding (i.e. not capitals) would have made things easier for typographic features such as figure styles. As for the problem of the vagueness surrounding the default figure style, layout applications should be able to calculate this, by checking to see which features the default style appears in.</p>
<p><em>The agenda belongs to Germans or Germany, not Unicode.</em></p>
<p>There are also a few characters in Greek and Cyrillic scripts.</p>

<p>I think that every single uppercase eszett which I have seen so far looks like comedy. Or tragedy. This new letter is supposed to resemble the lowercase eszett so it can be recognized as an eszett at all, and at the same time needs to fit into the visual language of the uppercase alphabet. Which should be hard to achieve since the lowercase eszett is a ligature of lowercase letters. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter if it combines long-s + s, or long-s + semicolon-like symbol.

Perhaps the theatrical effect Karsten decries is caused by the overtly &ldquo;designy&rdquo; quality of the new glyph.
So why not just give the majuscule character the same shape as the minuscule?
After all, there are many other letters of the alphabet which share their shape across cases: C, I, J, O, S, U, V, W, X, and Z.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, looks much better. Have you tried the uppercase S&rsquo;s serif instead of the ball?
In this case, no romance for me. Mr Berlow&rsquo;s post is really great since it highlights a couple of flaws in the arguments pro an uppercase eszett.</p>
<p>Mr Lozos, as I understand the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#Tailored_Casing_Operations" target="_blank">unicode.org information</a>, the uppercase eszett is there now but its existence does not change casing rules &ndash; eszett becomes SS in all caps setting. Uppercase eszett is meant for &lsquo;special cases&rsquo;.* Following this, it would be a mistake if features would switch from lowercase to uppercase or smallcap eszett.
The only thing you might do is
    sub whatever_this_letters_postscript_name_is by germandbls;
in the c2sc feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>The paragraph from the above-mentioned unicode.org link:
<cite>In particular, capital sharp s is intended for typographical representations of signage and uppercase titles, and other environments where users require the sharp s to be preserved in uppercase.</cite> Overall, such usage is rare. In contrast, standard German orthography uses the string &ldquo;SS&rdquo; as uppercase mapping for small sharp s. Thus, with the default Unicode casing operations, capital sharp s will lowercase to small sharp s, but not the reverse: small sharp s uppercases to &ldquo;SS&rdquo;. <cite>In those instances where the reverse casing operation is needed,</cite> a tailored operation would be required.

I think I&rsquo;ll go with number 2.
Number 1 is a bit dull. I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to have a new glyph available, why not get into the spirit of the thing?
Bur not too much, 3 &amp; 4 with the spur are a bit flashy in this modern style. 5 &amp; 6 are too odd &ndash; foundries should try to stick to the pointy-ear Unicode model, because it has been thought out, and some consistency will help get the idea accepted. Or else why bother?

<p>I am German and I had problems with it all the time! I can&rsquo;t write the name of my home town in caps. I can&rsquo;t set a book cover in small caps when the name of the author has an Eszett in it. (Meißner and Meissner are different names, so you can&rsquo;t set them both as MEISSNER.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need it in the case feature at the moment, because the replacement »ß to SS« will not go away for some time. It just needs to be in the font, whenever we need to set a proper name.</p>
<p>Nick,
don&rsquo;t take 1 or 5. They would be read as B. Your test word GROßE (»big«) would then mean »crude« (GROBE).</p>

<p>Technically, you <em>could</em> do the sustitution in case and smcp etc. But the Unicode information suggest that you <em>should not</em>. So no need to worry.
This uppercase eszett is an encoded character, so it is not advisable to make it the target of glyph substitution via any layout feature. A designer feeling tempted to insert it should use keyboard or Glyph Palette.</p>

<p>Interesting. I never had problems setting my SCHLOSSTRASSE in all caps (before a bunch of half-hearted spelling reforms). And by current ortho/typo-graphic rules, Meißner and Meissner both are correctly represented as MEISSNER. If Herr &amp; Frau Meißner should feel unhappy about it, your typographic education will have enabled you to emphasize the name by italics, larger size, another typeface, or not.</p>

<p>Sure, there are workarounds. But isn&rsquo;t it bizarre that I should change the style of type setting, just because there is one name with an ß involved?
In books it is common practice to set names in small caps. But with German names involved I can&rsquo;t do it. And it&rsquo;s really not just about annoying Frau Meißner. It&rsquo;s about unambiguousness! Let&rsquo;s say a scientific text has a reference to a another book written by someone named MEISSNER. Is it Meißner or Meissner then?
I guess we can talk for hours why we need an fi ligature, because it&rsquo;s unacceptable that f and i would touch. But setting a proper name right doesn&rsquo;t matter?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fortunately, I think, there are organizations around in Germany who make decisions about proper and improper German writing. The Unicode Consortium is not one of these organizations. IIRC, the most recent issue of <em>DUDEN</em> states that ß should be written as SS in strings of capital letters.</p>
<p>With a cap ß in Unicode, you could program a font to make substitutions like Meißner to MEIßNER <em>(with cap ß… not in this font yet, hehe),</em> but it still would not be correct German. The correct way is still MEISSNER. Now, because software has changed, perhaps a future <em>DUDEN</em> will make a spelling change, too. But it has not yet done so. And I think that they will want to hear from more than just a few concerned typographers, too, before they change the language&rsquo;s rules. Who knows?</p>
<p>So, when you build your fonts, if you put in a capital ß (who is really going to start doing this? Adobe? Microsoft? Monotype? Linotype? FontFont?), it requires a bit of code, because when the word Meißner is highlighted in InDesign and made all caps, the change should still be to MEISSNER. Since there is no cap ß key on any German keyboard, the cap ß will only have accessible via the glyph pallette or a stylistic set, contextual alternate, etc.</p>

<p>Dan, that&rsquo;s not true. According to the DUDEN proper names should keep their Eszett when set in caps. 
Aus Gründen der Eindeutigkeit. (»for the sake of unambiguousness«)
They use the example »HEINZ GROßE« (set with a lowercase Eszett of course)</p>

That&rsquo;s pretty obvious and not just my own strange opinion.</p>
<p>Now that the Unicode point is official, it&rsquo;s up to the type designers and graphic designers to support it or not. Since the old case mapping is still in effect, everyone who doesn&rsquo;t like the capital sharp s has no need to worry. You can leave your OT features as they are and you can go on and set German texts as always. 
As someone who would like to use, I&rsquo;m perfectly fine if I have to fish it out of the glyph palette whenever I have to set a German proper name with an ß.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a summary:</p>
<p>(1)  There is a new Unicode codepoint for uppercase eszett.
(2)  There are orthographic rules for case mapping. And it is not the Uncode Consortium&rsquo;s business to change these. This means, the eszett-to-SS case mapping is left untouched, as pointed out explicitly in the UC&rsquo;s information. What is allowed is mapping uppercase-eszett to lowercase-eszett. 
(3)  <em>If anyone plans to add this letter to fonts,</em> the only questions left are:
What does it look like? Up to the designer.
How to name it? Maybe &lsquo;uni1E9E&rsquo;.
How to deal with it in features? Add &ldquo;sub uni1E9E by germandbls.sc;&quot;* in &lsquo;c2sc&rsquo; to address the uppercase-to-lowercase mapping mentioned in (2). No coverage in other features though, following current best practice to not substitute encoded glyphs with encoded glyphs.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with opinion but with currently valid orthography and best practices as regards font production.</p>
<p>So my question is, what is the point you are trying to make? Of course you can spell and case as you like, but the result would be your &ldquo;private Sprache&rdquo;, nothing that should concern anyone else.</p>
<p>Sorry for repeating things already said in previous posts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Or whatever your smallcaps suffix is. If you use two sets of smallcaps (one mapping from lowercase, the other from uppercase) then it would be something like &ldquo;sub uni1E9E by uni1E9E.c2sc;&rdquo;.</li>

<p>Of the four blue forms I prefer the third.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to give inspiration, of course, (this is clearly only one option of many), and am hoping that you find it useful or interesting at least. The nicety of type design is, that you can find so many different solutions for a given problem.</p>

<p>handsome work. I like the one that you used in the top row (the one incorporated into the word &ldquo;großes&rdquo;). But my favorite is number 2 in the bottom row (the one with the edge on the top): thanks to the edgy roof, there is no way to mistake it for a &ldquo;B&rdquo;. Also, it&rsquo;s easier and more natural to draw by hand (one-two-three straight strokes plus an S shape). The forms with the half-rounded top are somewhat unnatural and clunky to draw by hand &ndash; the top part requires an &ldquo;unfinished&rdquo;, &ldquo;interrupted&rdquo; hand movement. Also, the form (number 2 in the bottom row) has an unmistakengly &ldquo;capital&rdquo; flavor.</p>

<p>Like others, I have come to the opposite conclusion.
IMO a top left corner makes the letter too busy, accentuating its &ldquo;ligaturishness&rdquo; rather than its integrity as a discrete character.
In all your examples, the lower case &ldquo;s&rdquo; is clearly visible&ndash;it would be better to more fully integrate it into the letter form.
Don&rsquo;t the better lower-case &ldquo;ß&rdquo; designs follow the principle of camouflaging the &ldquo;s&rdquo; component?</p>

<p>Do you mean the beta-shaped ß? I certainly don&rsquo;t like it but I guess that&rsquo;s a matter of taste. There are some very good fonts with the ligature/visible s model. Btw, wasn&rsquo;t this type first proposed by Tschichold?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. Just look at the Garamond ß in the first post of this thread.
The shape of the curved side of the ß has an integrity of form, it is a complete &ldquo;line of beauty&rdquo; in its own right, with a central angle which has a perpendicular quality that is part of the curve shape, not merely the joint between the &ldquo;f&rdquo; and &ldquo;s&rdquo; components.</p>

<p>My design decisions are based on the following thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think the cap ß should take its cues from the lowercase ß as much as possible &ndash; they should look like they are related stylistically, since they are part of the same typeface, and people are already familiar with the lowercase form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the ligated (Tschichold) form can be translated to an uppercase form, as much as I like it in the lowercase form. It&rsquo;s too complex and relies on the space above the s, which caps don&rsquo;t have. This leaves the &ldquo;B&rdquo; form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, I tried to get a hint of the ligated form in the Garamond example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the lowercase it helps that the ß doesn&rsquo;t look like any other lowercase letters. But, as a capital, I don&rsquo;t think the &ldquo;B&rdquo;-ness of the ß can be avoided by introducing novel forms to its construction. My solution, to help distinguish the cap ß from the cap B, is to open up the interior space and make it a bit wider</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tail on the bottom right takes a form similar to the lowercase form, but in scale with the other capitals. The terminal on the cap J usually works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used a corner shape in the upper left because it makes it look more like a cap and to help distinguish it from the beta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the other proposed designs I think look too busy, novel or exotic, calling attention to themselves and failing to harmonize well with the other letters. I also think a lot of them work for some faces better than others. I hope to overcome this by sticking with elements of letters and forms that are already present in the typeface and keeping the general form simple and straightforward.</p>
</li>
</ul>

now I see what you mean. The ß from Garamond is a real beauty – maybe because it is the golden mean between the &ldquo;beta&rdquo; and the &ldquo;ligature&rdquo; models?</p>
<p>Mark,
interesting comments. Before I read them I thought, is he trying to make the UC ß as similar to the B as possible? But maybe it&rsquo;s just a matter of getting used to it. After all, we distinguish many letters by relatively small differences.
That letter remains a difficult thing to design and I have the feeling we might never find really convincing solutions.</p>

<p>Which ones?
There are letters like E/F or P/R which share large parts, but they still have a significant difference in there general skeleton, and this difference is maintained and clearly visible in any size or any kind of type style. But all of Marks designs use the skeleton of the B with a &ldquo;strange thing&rdquo; going on at the bottom. I read nothing but Bs even if I try to see a cap Eszett.<br>
Tim&rsquo;s designs are not the ones I would favour, but they clearly solve the problem. I am not tempted at all to read GROBES.</p>

<p>I tried to work out my solution for Neoritmo, and I am satisfied with it. I must say I probably cheated, since Neoritmo, from its conception, already incorporates what &ldquo;technical people&rdquo; would call a sort of &ldquo;disntegration/integration of bicameral logic&rdquo;, and it has an uppercase H which is still rooted in the lowercase. A beta of Neoritmo can be seen here: <a href="http://www.cannibal.gr/multimedia_sub.aspx?cat=3&amp;sub=7&amp;prj=38&amp;xyz=742&amp;lang=en">http://www.cannibal.gr/multimedia_sub.aspx?cat=3&amp;sub=7&amp;prj=38&amp;xyz=742&amp;lang=en</a>

<p>I was afraid you&rsquo;d say that. :-)</p>
<p>Depending on the font (Georgia&rsquo;s not bad, because of the old style figures), many of these are hard to distinguish without context: Il1, O0o, rnm, 5S, 2Zz. In some cases, the only differences are a little hook or serif or corner instead of a curve or a slight gap or difference in height or width.</p>
<p>Context helps a lot. Even the current ß, if used in place of a B, reads as a B.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s problematic to introduce a new form to the alphabet. Reading depends on familiarity of forms. If a novel form is introduced, it&rsquo;s natural to try to interpret it as a letter we already know. (A lot of logos use this to great effect.) In cases where there are two words, such as große and grobe, it may take more time to get used to, but I suspect that this is an edge case and unusual, and that most words that contain ß do not have such an evil twin and would be interpreted correctly due to context, given time to become familiar with the new form (even mine).</p>
<p>In any case, as someone who doesn&rsquo;t read German natively, I do feel at a disadvantage with this problem. I&rsquo;m just trying to apply what I know to the problem and making some observations. Part of my motivation for speaking up is selfish: Some of the proposed designs look very awkward to me and I would hate to have to be the one to adapt them into existing faces.</p>

I think as designers, we work on glyphs and have a knowledge of what is the essence of that glyph since we have been seeing it or drawing it all of our lives. The trouble comes when we define a new glyph that as of yet has no agreed upon essence in form, It is simply not in our repertoire yet. I guess we are a few hundred years late to the game :-) Instead of depicting the essence by giving it form, we are defining the essence without knowing the form. It is like a tailor who knows how to fit a suit of an old customer, having done it many times. He may get a call from a brand new customer but gets no details of size or measurements or taste in fabric or color, he only know that he is a different size than all of his other customers. Would our tailor create the perfect fit sight-unseen on the first try?</p>

I think Chris is entirely right. I think you should get the essence of a letterform. Since the SS is a &ldquo;S-related&rdquo; or &ldquo;S-sound&rdquo; letter, I couldn&rsquo;t treat it as an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; form to invent.
Here&rsquo;s my form for Neoritmo. The UC [ß] is the same height of the [H], which has an ascending part. The interruption of the [ß]s is a choice, and the form can be seen continuous. What I think is that we may compensate for its feeling of &ldquo;lowercaseness&rdquo; by making the upper left corner a &ldquo;supercurve&rdquo; (more angular), and thus neither rounded nor angled.

<p>I totally agree to that, but the thing is: B and capital sharp S will always appear in the same context, so we need a clear distinction within the skeleton of the letter. Context can not always help: 
&ldquo;Die große Wurst&rdquo; (the big sausage). 
&ldquo;Die grobe Wurst&rdquo; (the coarse sausage).
I wouldn&rsquo;t even mind if different shapes come into use (as with single/double-storey a and g), as long as they cannot be mistaken for a B.</p>

I chose the Dresdner form for the LC as I liked the way the top stroke suggested a chirographic break with the bottom, and that quirkyness seemed to suit the face.
I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a necessity to have overt shape-echoes between the cases, as the UC eszett only appears in all-cap settings.</p>

Is this not one for German designers to solve (at this &lsquo;early&rsquo; stage at least)? This is a uniquely German challenge, isn&rsquo;t it? I can&rsquo;t help thinking that if there were a &lsquo;new&rsquo; character used only in my language, that if someone steamed in from another country that spoke and wrote a different language and told me what it ought to look like&hellip;</p>
<p>If one can get rather animated and protective over the correct vs incorrect angle of the smallest accent in a particular language, how much more would an entire character get tensions running high.</p>
<p>I feel completely unqualified to comment on any of these designs, much as I like some and dislike others. I am far more interested in what, for example, Ralf thinks (he is the &lsquo;consumer&rsquo;), especially as he has been so helpful by elucidating some of the issues involved, which would never have occurred to me.</p>
<p>Just because there is going to be a gap in the Unicode list, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be filled in a given font, especially not with dross (I&rsquo;m not saying the designs above are dross, by the way). The slightly irritating fact of the matter is that the trend is in danger of being set by the hastiest designers rather than considered and informed solutions which might solve the problem in a more efficient manner. Idealistic, I know. I&rsquo;m sure someone will pile in and put me straight.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this is a problem non-German designers can&rsquo;t solve, it&rsquo;s not very difficult in that respect. All the background is accessible in this thread. All we need to know is summarized by Jason,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;these seem to work best within their own context, being neither to lower-casey nor B-like, and certainly unmistakable for their lower-case counterparts.&quot;</em></p>
<p>All we have to do is make that work in our own types, and you can see an example in Jason&rsquo;s Agamemnon&ndash;surely you don&rsquo;t have to be German to appreciate how nicely the Eszett is realized as an expression of that typeface, how well it integrates with the other characters?</p>

this thread, it has already grown beyond recognition!
It warms my heart - I love newborn characters.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>This is clearly a tricky design problem, with many factors pushing and pulling. If German didn&rsquo;t use caps so much, the problem of the cap eszet looking too much like a &ldquo;B&rdquo; would be secondary. But that&rsquo;s what we have to work with.</p>
<p>I mostly agree with Nick on the &ldquo;nativity&rdquo; issue in this case. As unnerving as the ethnic intrusion might feel to some (I know from my own experience of watching non-Armenians design Armenian type), especially because this is a new character/glyph I think non-Germans can contribute a lot.</p>
<p>That said, of course Germans are the &ldquo;customer&rdquo;. Even though we can&rsquo;t trust laymen to give reliable feedback about a proposed glyph&rsquo;s stylistic integrity with the whole or its non-ligatureness, the issue of diverging sufficiently from the &ldquo;B&rdquo; is something I think that only German laymen can help us with.</p>
<p>So I propose rounding up the best few candidates (for a normal text font, like maybe Georgia), preparing a Flash movie where some carefully-chosen words are&hellip; flashed for varying very short durations in front of readers on non-typographic web sites, and then ask them what they read.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you only show individual glyphs, certainly. But if you carefully chose the words that either have a &ldquo;B&rdquo; or a cap eszet, I think you might start getting a feel for the boundaries. Think for example of the word &ldquo;apposite&rdquo; in English. It&rsquo;s a much rarer word than &ldquo;opposite&rdquo;, so in Avant Garde for example you will get many more people reading it as &ldquo;opposite&rdquo;, but in Quadraat for example more people will read it as &ldquo;apposite&rdquo;, even if they don&rsquo;t even know what it means. BTW, &ldquo;apposite&rdquo; sort of means the opposite of &ldquo;opposite&rdquo;.  :-)</p>
<p>So we would need to find German word pairs like that, and try the different proposed cap eszets to gauge which ones look less like a &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When I said &lsquo;hastiest&rsquo;, maybe I should have said &lsquo;most eager&rsquo; and maybe being eager is a good qualification to set the pace. Maybe I was hasty, sorry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t believe this is a problem non-German designers can’t solve&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right, anyone from anywhere can solve a problem (to say otherwise would be bordering on racism), but in this case isn&rsquo;t it a bit like telling a French, Spanish, Catalan person etc, what their cedillas should look like, when they were the ones who invented it/them? That just makes me nervous.</p>
<p>There remains a conflict in my mind because the reality is that no-one can really tell me what my Eszett should look like in <em>my own</em> font. It&rsquo;s no-one else&rsquo;s business (not even Germans) and in that sense we all have to be able to solve the problem for every font that we design.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m still intrigued because the &lsquo;problem&rsquo; seems to have only come to light in recent times (hasn&rsquo;t it?) That makes me think Germans were not <em>that</em> bothered about solving it (not as bothered about it as the majority of us on this thread who aren&rsquo;t German) and for us to tell them that they have a problem makes me very nervous.</p>
<p>Finally, on a creative note, no-one can have a genuine problem with this new character being B-ish? (P and R are all relatively B-ish but voice completely different sounds) as long as the two characters cannot be mistaken in context (that is where Ralf and friends have indispensable advice). In the end usage and context may well design this character for us.</p>

<p>Actually, despite the popular Korean belief that King Sejong appointed his team of scholar-officials with the creation of hangul (the Korean alphabet), modern scholars agree that it was a personal project of the king himself. So hangul was not conceived by a mass committee.</p>

Unicode and OpenType, among other things, are part of present-day internationalism, and the field of font design and production are wide open to foundries worldwide.</p>
<p>If foreign type-designers are heavy-handed, it&rsquo;s up to indigenous typographers to ignore their typefaces.
Trans-national corporations like Microsoft and Adobe, that are bundling large numbers of fonts globally, have to be more circumspect, because their types will become something of a de facto standard. However, the fact that there is a variety of options available to those who choose and purchase fonts from independent foundries should provide cultural checks and balances, while allowing some &ldquo;foreign spice&rdquo; to make things more interesting.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, what I&rsquo;m describing is merely an observation tool - it can only help a
designer make a decision; it cannot replace the designer&rsquo;s overall judgment.</p>
<p>Of the three factors I can discern, namely stylistic fit, non-ligatureness and non-&ldquo;B&rdquo;-ness, only the last can be addressed by the sort of informal field study I describe. And all such a field study could do is give the designers a feeling for how a glyph is being read. That still leaves the bulk of decision-making to the designer&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>So for example you might only give up on a very &ldquo;B&rdquo;-like cap eszet for Avant Garde if the study results are totally disastrous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand what you mean. Can you explain that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was hoping my &ldquo;apposite&rdquo; example clarified things. But let me try this: you choose a pair of German words where one has a &ldquo;B&rdquo; in one spot while the other has an eszet in the same spot (ideally with both words having comparable frequency; or you could weight the results based on the relative frequencies). You set them in all-caps and flash them for very short periods in front of readers, then ask them to type the word. Refinements might involve: using different durations, maybe between 1/10 and 1/4 of a second; using words that start with &ldquo;B&rdquo;/cap-eszet and setting the rest in lc; and putting the words in the parafovea (by asking the reader to focus on a point that&rsquo;s some distance* to the left of the flashed word).</p>
<ul>
<li>To be determined by factoring in screen
resolution and viewing distance; tricky.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Germans were not that bothered about solving it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, most Germans don&rsquo;t design fonts.  :-)
In fact many Germans want[ed] to dump the <em>lc</em> eszet! For shame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; as long as the two characters cannot be mistaken in context</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes they could. But the fewer words that might have this problem, the lesser the problem, and the less it makes sense to sweat it, I agree.</li>
<li>This is a new character. Changing an <em>established</em> character is a whole other animal!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>modern scholars agree that it was a personal project of the king himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really? I didn&rsquo;t know that. In a way, that&rsquo;s even more impressive (or maybe my monarchist tendencies are at play :-).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting here that many people (including myself) consider Hangul to be by far the most powerful and elegant writing system. To me it makes English look like the village idiot.</p>

<p>No, because were designing a completely new character here, not changing an existing one. Anyone in the world can understand the design problems and solve them. As for me, I really appreciate the ideas in this thread.</p>
<p>The introduction of complete new alphabets is a different thing, because everyone was forced to learn a completely new system. But here we&rsquo;re trying to sneak in a new character in a set of characters everyone is used to. This is not easy. It must have a distinct design but still feel like it was always there and must be easily recognized as a cap Eszett.</p>
<p>Arranging legibility test with system fonts like Georgia would be a nice way to check for the B problem. Speaking of Georgia: Maybe we should also try to solve this the Carter-way: The character must also work in a small copy text like this one here on Typophile. Maybe it would be a good idea to start with simple pixel grid, in which it would be easy to see if the skeleton is different enough from B and R.</p>

<p>The trouble is, many upper case glyphs look like their lowercase counterparts but many don&rsquo;t - it&rsquo;s about half and half depending on which font you&rsquo;re talking about. Now, who is to say whether the upper case long s is one of the characters that looks like its lowercase counterpart or not; e.g. it might actually look like an F/gamma or even a crazy J, who is to say?</p>
<p>But, surely anyone can decide what an uppercase long s looks like and may the best man/woman &lsquo;win&rsquo;. Aren&rsquo;t you (and Nick S) saying that the uppercase long s looks like half an inverted U and not a F/gamma? Why is that anymore right than the F/gamma approach?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to say that historically the long s had nothing to do with f but it kinda did, didn&rsquo;t it? You can&rsquo;t really fault anyone for going for the uppercase F as a model for the uppercase long s too.</p>
<p>Are you saying, first and foremost, that we need to have some consensus on what an uppercase long s looks like? If so, you are bound to get some that think that because what you&rsquo;re talking about doesn&rsquo;t really exist, then this new glyph should actually look like two regular uppercase S&rsquo;s ligatured. Then the next logical question is, &ldquo;Did they actually need ligaturing?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure they do, just like FI and FFL etc don&rsquo;t really warrant special characters.</p>
<p>All I want is for the logic to be good. Rightly or wrongly, having good, robust logic bothers me more than whether the character looks nice. Not many posters on this thread seem to share my concerns logically. Anyone (OK, not anyone) can design a lovely a character, a lot of the proposed Long s&rsquo;s in this thread look great, but don&rsquo;t they amount to nothing more than follies if the logic that conceived them was flawed?</p>
<p>Question 1 for me is &ldquo;So what does an uppercase long s (if it actually ought to be made to live and breathe at all) really look like?&rdquo; If one answers this then one might be on the way to defining the look of the actual ligature in its entirety. If you can&rsquo;t answer this question, maybe don&rsquo;t force a ligature to exist.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Reading things into Mr Berlow&rsquo;s comment, at the risk of misreading it &hellip;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like Mr Berlow said that this or that uppercase form of long-s is right or wrong, but rather that there is and never was an uppercase long-s so it&rsquo;s a bit of an idle game.</p>
<p>As regards the logic part &hellip;</p>
<p>Ralf, earlier: <cite>But all of Marks designs use the skeleton of the B with a &ldquo;strange thing&rdquo; going on at the bottom. [&hellip;] Tim&rsquo;s designs are not the ones I would favour, but they clearly solve the problem. I am not tempted at all to read GROBES.</cite></p>
<p>Amusingly Mr Simonson&rsquo;s shapes fit much nicer into uppercase letters' visual laws while Tim&rsquo;s, nice as they are, suffer from having four rather than the usual three horizontal elements and a 3/4 S which &ndash; whether Mr Berlow qualified for judging by not submitting his own Eszett to the jury or not &ndash; <em>is</em> a little alien. Consider Mr Simonson&rsquo;s versions as long-s reminder (the stem) plus a diacritic mark similar to connected semicolon, which construction has some resemblance to early &ldquo;eszetts&rdquo;.
Still I cannot help considering the uppercase Eszett as a bastard. The lowercase version already contains a letterforms that by itself does not exist any more (long-s), and any uppercase version needs to come up with an uppercase long-s which never existed and which must be unintelligent by design. The only solution is, more or less, to uppercasify the lowercase version. But this solution actually means violating the typographic rule to not use an eszett in all-caps setting, but hiding this a bit by dressing up what structurally is a lowercase letter so it <em>looks</em> more like an uppercase. &ldquo;Uppercase Eszett&rdquo; itself is logically not sound.</p>

<p>All the lc glyphs are bastards (as Cassandre duly noted).
But they rule the earth now, so we better work with them.</p>
<p>The interesting twist with the cap eszet is that -apparently- no
words start with it. So its harmony with other caps seems to be

unnerving that it took so long to take it seriously.)</p>

<p>Don’t know of ‘Ss’, but Hungarian has a lot of words starting with ‘Sz’. According to an entry in the <a href="http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/latin_small_letter_sharp_s">Decode Unicode Wiki</a>, some Hungarians like to replace ‘sz’ with ‘ß’ in text messages – because so they can save a character. To me, that doesn’t sound very plausible, in times of T9 dictionaries.
Same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ß#Switzerland_and_Liechtenstein">is said about the Swiss</a>: SMS efficiency made them raise the ‘ß’ from the dead. Again, I’d say this mainly has to do with the built-in dictionaries: When typing ‘Grus…’, the dictionary proposes ‘Gruß’ [greeting] – which is gladly accepted.
Just leetspeak.</p>

<p>This sort of logic is common, but I don&rsquo;t think it is right. Are German umlauts bastards because they are originally build from a lowercase letter (e) placed on top of a capital letter? Is an A a wrong character because the ox was turned upside down? This sort of logic, that is based on a character&rsquo;s history or the history of parts of the letters doesn&rsquo;t lead anywhere. 
Letters are nothing but tools and they should be judged according to this and nothing else. Capital Umlauts were created because there was a need for them. And now is the time for the capital sharp S. We just need to figure out the right shape(s) of this tool. And this design process should be based on the question of what works best for the user/reader, not on the history of Eszett (which is unclear till today anyhow).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ralf, I was addressing Nick Job&rsquo;s post which spoke about logic.
I do not understand what you mean by &ldquo;this sort of logic&rdquo;. If you design a letter, you need some kind of logic to make sure that the letter can be identified as that. A letter must fit into the context of other letters in terms of particular design style and, more important, fit into the rest of the alphabet in terms of structure (construction) and features &ndash; to make sure a tone [mere shape on a page] can be identified as a token [instantiation] of a type [this or that character]. Beware of people who (want to) make history without knowing it. Look at IPA monsters to see what happens if history &ndash; repertory of signs and marks that already exist &ndash; is left aside: &ldquo;tool approach&rdquo; at its best.
Problem with uppercase Eszett is that either one tries to make it visually sound, then it looks like Mark Simonson&rsquo;s or maybe like a lowercase eszett tweaked to look more like an uppercase, or structurally correct, which option is not even available because there is no uppercase long-s.</div>

Well that seems to be exactly the thing they only just realized. :)
Seriously, from what I&rsquo;ve been told by Mr Stötzner as my former typography teacher-cum-editor, (and I do realize I&rsquo;m probably stating the very obvious here,) that was, for a long time, the official reason why this character had no <em>raison d&rsquo;être:</em> &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need a capital letter if there are no words that begin with it.&rdquo; The fact that such a thing as an all-caps setting exists (and has given way to &lsquo;creative&rsquo; uses of the lowercase ß, as well as even more creative designs of uppercase variants by laymen and also by artists, see e.g. numerous examples from the field of epigraphy), has long been ignored by official opinion.
I cannot recommend SIGNA 9 highly enough for people interested in the history, morphology and design scope of this letter.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Poor craft&rdquo; or &ldquo;pure craft&rdquo;?
So my last two posts were not clear. An uppercase Eszett is self-contradiction &ndash; structurally. Which can be seen in design attempts so far. &ldquo;Poor craft&rdquo; thus reflects <em>not</em> participating designers' incompetence but the more fundamental structural problem. (&ldquo;Problem with uppercase Eszett is &hellip;&rdquo; in my last post, and comparison of Tim&rsquo;s and Mr Simonson&rsquo;s attempts in yesterday&rsquo;s post.)
In case you meant &ldquo;pure craft&rdquo; &ndash; that would be a somewhat superficial conception of design, from my point of view. If you don&rsquo;t have a proper understanding of what you are supposed to design, what are you designing then?</p>

Well correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but since the genesis of the lowercase Eszett is still somewhat cloudy, it&rsquo;s not that easy to isolate one historical root &amp; think it through.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to reverse engineer history, couldn&rsquo;t it be another way – maybe a parallel one – to look at those uc ß letters that already exist: in epigraphy, in people&rsquo;s handwriting, in some rare print samples; &amp; then think from what works for &lsquo;the user&rsquo; and how they understand the letter, instead of trying to mimic an imaginary, &lsquo;correct&rsquo; history of a letter that we&rsquo;re actually inventing now? That feels like reverse science fiction.
&lsquo;Thinking from the user&rsquo; may be heretical, but why should it be a less legitimate approach? In the end, letters <em>are</em> tools of communication.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just the thing I was looking for. A living language that may well use the new option of a capital letter as an initial in regular text as opposed to a medial in all-caps setting (as it would be used in German). Such a use may be regarded as merely slang for a generation or more, but it could be absorbed into official recognition eventually should it become popular.</p>

<p>No way. What I&rsquo;m saying is that teaching about history is useful only to the extent of understanding the present; the problem is that some people <em>emulate</em> history. To me studying history is like studying a car crash. Also, just because hobbyists and secretaries don&rsquo;t know history doesn&rsquo;t mean they know design.</p>
<p>A great specific example here is the ampersand. It comes from &ldquo;e&rdquo; + &ldquo;t&rdquo;. Whoop-di-doo. When you take that too seriously you end up with a form that causes reading problems for many people*, like in Poppl Laudatio (which I otherwise adore). A well-designed ampersand is based on what people need; what it used to be is just fodder for pedantic discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m talking about text fonts; sometimes, if
rarely, the &ldquo;e&rdquo;+&ldquo;t&rdquo; form is highly suitable.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>structural problem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if I agree that the cap eszet has some sort of structural incompatibility with the rest of the alphabet (which I don&rsquo;t think I do), it&rsquo;s still the responsibility of a good designer to try his best. Frankly though, people tolerate -and even are mostly oblivious to- all kinds of strange things in fonts, like the numerals have totally different stress. Even the UC and lc are really fundamentally different! So even if there is something inherently strange about the cap eszet, in a generation it can be absorbed just fine (like Jason says about script evolution).</p>

<p>Hrant, I don&rsquo;t agree with you because the E/e and t were not forced to look like (what we now call) a conventional ampersand unnaturally <em>from the beginning</em>, but over a matter of centuries. Could we not at least try to start in roughly the place it feels like it &lsquo;ought&rsquo; to start, i.e. with a capital eszett and a cap S. What you are trying to do is make a vast and  many-centuried leap of honing and tweaking in a single day. Once again, I greatly admire your ambitious enterprise but on this occasion it is, for me at least, very dissatisfying and misses out the most important part of the development, which is the establishment of what the embryonic form &lsquo;ought&rsquo; to look like.</p>

<p>Well, I agree with that; but I don&rsquo;t think what it ought to look like is based on anything more than what readers need - and to me readers specifically <em>don&rsquo;t</em> need something that looks like two other letters fused together. Since I believe that the upper limit of the number of symbols in a writing system that readers can handle is many orders of magnitude greater than merely 26, I think it&rsquo;s better for a symbol to look only like itself. This is why I favor the contemporary form of the ampersand, and I dislike @ signs where the inside part is a binocular &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Chris, love the duck call illustration but hang on. The very fact that Szabolcs has said, &ldquo;pretty much not identifyable as a capital version of ß&rdquo; implies that he has an actual identifyable capital ß in mind (granted, it maybe only be a capitalised lowercase ß) with which to measure the &lsquo;not&rsquo; against. If something is not <em>x</em>, it implies the existence of a positive, very real <em>x</em>, otherwise the statement is a nonsense. Now, I&rsquo;m certainly <u>not</u> implying Szabolcs&rsquo;s statement is nonsense. All I&rsquo;m trying to find out is what his identifyable capital ß looks like. If his answer is &ldquo;more like a lowercase ß&rdquo; then I think maybe a little more conservatism may be needed, for a good while at least, because this character is unavoidably bound/doomed to look like its lowercase counterpart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working in the dark until we invent the light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah, there&rsquo;s plenty of lights here, in this thread alone. But some seem determined to switch the lights off and work in the dark. I think it was Frank Pick (London Transport) who said, &ldquo;Good design is intelligence made visible.&rdquo; Is it in any way intelligent to try and invent a new character and expect it to be in any way legible from the outset?</p>
<p>Has anyone done a comprehensive analysis of what exists in German print/writing? Is there somewhere we can go to see what&rsquo;s out there? Next, are the existing versions of the glyph what people are measuring recognition/legibility/readability by? If not, then I would ask how are they measuring?* Again, a measure of anything necessarily requires an absolute against which to measure.</p>
<p>*My fear again is that the plumbline is the lowercase ß which again dooms this character to looking like its lowercase ancestor in its various guises (leipziger/dresdner/whatever). OK it&rsquo;s &lsquo;safe&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s also bound to be very legible/readable. Nice try, anyone who&rsquo;s going for anything different - but it&rsquo;ll never actually <em>work</em>.</p>

<p>I hearily agree with this &ldquo;nothing exists without its opposite&rdquo; stance. The thing is, this nebulous idea of a shape isn&rsquo;t necessarily easy to move from the depths of the mind to the consciousness! This being required to actually make the glyph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this character is unavoidably bound/doomed

<p>This is indeed a very good point to keep in mind. But frankly this answers the concern: &ldquo;Is it in any way intelligent to try and invent a new character and expect it to be in any way legible from the outset?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some seem determined to switch the lights off and work in the dark.</p>

<p>While others want to see the way forward
by looking into a rear-view mirror?  :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a measure of anything necessarily requires

</blockquote>
<p>But -as above- that absolute need not be fully grasped. In this case the &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; is simply the degree to which a reader can read the thing!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My fear again is  that the plumbline is the lowercase ß which

</blockquote>
<p>Why fear? This is something to leverage. On one side the glyph should have features that pull it towards its lc &ldquo;recognition anchor&rdquo;, while on the other side the glyph should have features (like UC proportions, as well as a certain monumentalism) that pull it away from lc <em>set</em>.</p>

<p>Sorry to butt in just once more (I do feel kind of underqualified, so let me know if I&rsquo;m just stating the obvious).</p>
<p>Your question, Nick, is exactly why I recommended <a href="http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=29">Stötzner&rsquo;s publication on the capital Eszett (SIGNA 9)</a>. He shows a pretty impressive collection of uppercase Eszetts in use, and yes, there exists an idea even among laymen totally unaware of this whole discussion of what it could/should look like; and some of them (restaurant and shop owners, epigraphers, letter writers) have made up forms that I would say are pretty much unanimously readable. Which is why I posed that question about factoring in the user perspective as well, which indeed already exists.</p>
<p>If there is any interest in this, I can e-mail Mr. Stötzner and ask him if I could scan a couple of relevant images and put them online here (if he&rsquo;s not reading this anyway).</p>

<p><cite>Are there any words in ANY languages that begin with “ss”? Would these languages benefit from a spelling reform to replace that digraph with eszett (and by extension Eszett)?</cite></p>
<p>You might have heard of Korean automobile manufacturer Ssangyong Motors. Korean distinguishes between two versions of <em>s</em>: a normal <em>s</em> and a ‘tense’ <em>s</em>. The <em>s</em> sounds in most other languages, including English, are actually closer to the Korean ‘tense’ <em>s</em>.</p>
<p>In hangul (the Korean alphabet), the former is written ㅅ and the latter written ㅆ, which comes from doubling the symbol for the normal <em>s</em>. The same logic is applied to form the symbols for all the tense consonants: ㄲ from ㄱ, ㄸ from ㄷ, ㅃ from ㅂ, ㅉ from ㅈ. Most romanization schemes represent ㅅ as <em>s</em> and ㅆ as <em>ss</em> in analogy with the consonant doubling in hangul. Because ㅆ can come in the beginning of a word in Korean, you can see romanized spellings that begin with <em>Ss</em> as in Ssangyong.</p>
<p>You also see romanized spellings that begin with <em>Kk</em>, <em>Pp</em>, and <em>Tt</em>, and in some romanization schemes, <em>Jj</em>. Other doubled letters such as <em>ll</em>, <em>mm</em>, and <em>nn</em> are found only in the middle of words. There is no reason to single out the digraph <em>ss</em> to be replaced with a symbol like the eszett.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Lithuanian#Personal_names">Prussian Lithuanians</a> seem to have used <em>ß</em> to represent the sound written <em>š</em> in standard modern Lithuanian orthography. For example, they wrote Baltßus for Balčius (<em>tß</em> represents the sound <em>č</em> = <em>tš</em>). However, the Prussian Lithuanian name corresponding to Lithuanian Šameitatis/Šameitaitis is Szameitat, so it seems they avoided <em>ß</em> word-initially and replaced it with <em>sz</em>. The Prussian Lithuanian community disappeared after World War II, though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> please can you tell us what the shape of the uppercase eszett is that you can most easily read as an uppercase eszett.</cite></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simple: We are only familiar with the lc shape, so that&rsquo;s what we recognize as an Eszett, even if it is placed within uc text.
For obvious typographic reasons we need a corresponding uc shape, instead of just using the lowercase Eszett in uppercase text. So we need to capitalize the lowercase shape. But if we do that, we end up with a character that looks like a B, so we can&rsquo;t use that either. What we need is a compromise. A shape that is close enough to the lowercase Eszett and far enough from the B. 
I think it is already pretty obvious where we are heading with that:
<img src="/images/old-images/eszettmix_6267.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A lot of designers seem to believe that such a compromise could never be a &ldquo;real&rdquo; capital letter, but I don&rsquo;t think this is true. It may look weird if your not used to it, but once it will be heavily used in Germany and Austria, it will just blend in with all the other characters. (We also just had spelling reformation with the same discussions about the old and new, what looks weird or &ldquo;right&rdquo;. Now, just after a couple of years, the (younger) people have already adapted the new rules, as if they were always there. It wont be any different with the capital Eszett.)</p>
<p>Furthermore I expect the capital Eszett to evolve further over the next decades. Once it will be in common use its shape may evolve away from the original compromise. But this needs to happen slowly. We cannot use the &ldquo;2058 shape&rdquo; today, even if we would know how it would look like. People wouldn&rsquo;t be able to read it and therefore not accept it. Like they would probably consider a car of the year 2058 an ugly bastard, without having seen the evolution that led to its design.</p>

<p>Aye, there&rsquo;s the rub! Funnily enough, my thoughts went right to a section looking sign myself. i tried a few quick drawings, but haven&rsquo;t had time to post a well-drawn version of what i came up with. Maybe after new years. I just hate the concept of a capital eszett anyway, but it&rsquo;s not my language. I understand those over-efficient German speakers need it to eradicate any possibility of ambiguity in their written language.</p>

So if we were having this discussion ten years ago, then I&rsquo;m afraid the Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Times, Comic Sans etc. styles would now be determining not the <em>best</em> way to design the cap eszett but the <em>commonest</em> and inadvertently spearhead the recognition issue through people&rsquo;s familiarity. We probably all agree that the most used typefaces are not the best looking. Again, we&rsquo;re doomed!</p>
<p>Ralf, that purple overlay diagram is very telling. What I guess you have to do is have the measure of transparency related to the recognition of each shape to give an even more accurate description of the accepted form. It&rsquo;s looking to me less like a Gamma (and less like a B) at the front end every time someone posts a new pic.</p>
<p>Chris, your four weren&rsquo;t that bad looking, you really don&rsquo;t need to worry. If I could draw type half as &lsquo;crudely&rsquo; as you I&rsquo;d be laughing.</p>

<p>If we imagine it as having a left and right side, the left side must go up and then curve to horizontal.  On the right side, the lower half has an uptick terminal and then curves something like an S upwards.</p>
<p>The option then comes in connecting the bottom right with the top left.  Either continue the S curve into the top (old fashioned model) or connect with a diagonal (Ralf&rsquo;s prefered model).</p>
<p>The section symbol is an interesting idea, but I&rsquo;m not sure given the section symbol&rsquo;s long history that readers would be able to read it as anything else other than a section symbol.</p>

By the way, also using Ş was proposed, i.e. an S with a CEDILLA (you get it: cedilla = little (long) Z), which I believe is a lovely idea, however, as I have argued on the forum, I don&rsquo;t believe it would be adopted by the user community, as it would feel very &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; (in a negative sense) to Germans.</p>
<p>Jongseong, the Prussian example only demonstrates, that the actual grapheme of Prussian to represent /sh/ was a digraph &lt;sz&gt; (like in Polish), and that <i>ß</i> was understood as a (&ldquo;stylistic&rdquo;) ligature of s and z.</p>
<p>Matthew, I think Ralf&rsquo;s diagram is &ldquo;biassed&rdquo; and you cannot use it alone to draw conclusions. E.g. he seems to use only a single layer with an angle on the top-left, while, clearly, several designs (w.r.t the right part of the letter) can exist having a Gamma-ish corner.</p>

<p>Indeed. This is what makes it very important to get a concerted, intelligent effort going, and then promulgate it, so that people making those future popular typefaces have something good to look at instead of being tempted to just whip something up based only on their own ideas.</p>
<p>Think for example of the Euro character. The original mandated design is unusable, so people started making their own in any which way.

<p>Good point, it&rsquo;s better not to use it (even though many people actually can&rsquo;t identify the Section symbol). But I can imagine something that looks very much like two &ldquo;S&quot;es but not too much like a Section. In fact I think most Section glyphs would not be identified by most people as two &ldquo;S&quot;es.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>With all these new double-S ligatures, witty as they are, we should not forget that this new letter should <cite>not</cite> look like a double-S. That&rsquo;s the whole point of having a sharp S: so it doesn&rsquo;t look like a double consonant.</p>
<p>In German, like in most languages, double consonants make the preceding vowel short, and this is where the ß comes into play: so that, for example, the o in &ldquo;großes&rdquo; does not &ldquo;look short&rdquo; as it would in &ldquo;grosses&rdquo;. Thanks to the reformed orthography this principle is quite clear now.</p>
<p>So, if we see the need for a sharp S then that&rsquo;s because words like &ldquo;GROSSES&rdquo; somehow &ldquo;look wrong&rdquo; (even though ortho-typographically correct). If the words with the new sharp S still look like &ldquo;GROSSES&rdquo; because the sharp S looks like SS then there&rsquo;s not much gained and it&rsquo;s not better than something that looks like &ldquo;GROBES&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ pretty clearly expresses itself as dominated by second-side terminal logic. So, when something is expected to be, by the sound unvoiced though it may be in a reader&rsquo;s mind, first-sided terminal logically, I think it is pretty important that it is, just to keep der dear reader downset. That a barless F <em> looks </em>more like an uppercase character than a J, is interesting, and may be appropriate in some places, but maybe just easiest way to make something look uppercase, and is not specific enough. Most who have experimented here have gravitated to serif designs, the ones with little feet things attached which makes it <em> blend in </em> all nice, but&hellip; I think in humanist sans, and of the sans experiments here, I think few approach success. So, relying on the stored biological memory of the original, pre-laziness lowercase form, and the space-saving intent of its creators, I go that way — clearly not a B, Beta, F3 ligature, SS, with no confusion at the waist and no gigantic open counter and with first-sided terminal logic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> Drawing, you know, is the first refuge of the confused. </cite>
@David: why?</p>
<p><cite> Beware of people who (want to) make history without knowing it.
[…]If you don’t have a proper understanding of what you are supposed to design, what are you designing then? </cite>
@Karsten: most important remarks. Altaira is also right: see historical precedents, if the form has  in some cases been written in &ldquo;more uppercase&rdquo; form (there is no fixed distinction about the two, save the one matured in typographic tradition).</p>
<p><cite> A great specific example here is the ampersand. It comes from “e” + “t”. Whoop-di-doo. When you take that too seriously you end up with a form that causes reading problems for many people*, like in Poppl Laudatio (which I otherwise adore). A well-designed ampersand is based on what people need; what it used to be is just fodder for pedantic discussion. </cite>
@Hrant: Downright pretentious, because the &ldquo;and-per-se-and&rdquo; is, and actually remains an &ldquo;et&rdquo;.
I would have had problems to understand its being an [e] just <em>before</em> someone told me it was an &ldquo;et&rdquo;, which – as an Italian – comes as a perfect logical succession, or better as the same thing.
It has happened some people asked me to change Rotis' &ldquo;Et&rdquo; into a more common [&amp;] form, but that&rsquo;s because people in Italy still think of the [&amp;] solely as a &ldquo;commercial e&rdquo; (in Italian it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;e commerciale&rdquo;), and they do not know it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;et&rdquo;, out of ignorance.</p>
<p>Read both these entries:
<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand</a> (Italian)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#Usage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#Usage</a> (English-International)</p>
<p>As much as Wikipedia is nonsense, these entries show how the evolution happens by a combination of planning and usage, despite all the thinking it may be done before.
The world may have become &ldquo;anglocentric&rdquo; (in terms of shared tongue), but – as you see – this happens out of necessity, otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to be here to talk together in a shared experience…</p>
<p>Now, my big question (since it is still not clear to me): is the [ß] a simple double s? Of course not, since it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; z-sound. So, why people keep using it as a substitute for &ldquo;ss&rdquo;?
Besides, how an &ldquo;ss&rdquo; ligature should be drawn?
And [AE] or [OE]? They are not ligatures, they address sounds, right?</p>

<p>All these links are found from Signographie.de. Andreas Stötzner is the great specialist on this character and also the one who proposed it to Unicode. You may also note there are different historical forms according to German region the shape comes from. For me, Dresdner is the most interesting one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Penabico (like many copperplate scripts) dont work good using only the versals, but only using versals followed by lowercases. The use of all uppercase letters to write words need by avoided. In the case of the uppercase germandbls is really a problem. But, I am working in this.

The middle stroke of the two &lsquo;S&rsquo;s could always be made lighter.</p>
<p>But you are right that something with two parallel strokes separated by a small space &ldquo;calls too much attention to itself&rdquo;, as it looks more like a logo than a letter, even if the &ldquo;too dark&rdquo; part is easily solved.</p>

<p>To me as a German reader, I still see them as Bs.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter, whether your real B look different in this typeface. Reading is too automatic to make such comparisons &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Nick Shinn has already solved it outstandingly:

		<div class="commentbody"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> In 2010, the German Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (“Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie”) published the 5th revised edition of the document <a href="http://www.stagn.de/Portals/0/101125_TopR5.pdf">“Toponymic guidelines for map and other editors for international use Federal Republic of Germany”</a>.</p>
<p>Section 1.1.3 of this document says:</p>
<blockquote><cite>1.1.3 Special letter ẞ ß
The special letter ß (“strong s”) existed hitherto only as small letter (minuscule). In 2007 DIN and ISO accepted the capital letter ẞ which is rendered on position 1E9E of the Unicode character tables. In official spelling it must not be substituted by any other letter combination, as e.g. SS, ss. In the alphabetical order ẞ, ß is treated like SS, ss. Since a typographical implementation of the upper case letter ẞ in the various character fonts will take some time, it may be temporarily substituted by SS, ss.
NEW: Due to the new regulation of German spelling the letter ß is after a short (stressed) vowel now replaced by ss. The letter ß remains after a long vowel or a diphthong.</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>Examples for names of geographical regions:
— now: Hassberge (short and stressed vowel a), until now: Haßberge
— will continue: Meißner (diphthong preceding ß), MEIẞNER
— will continue: Großer Feldberg (long vowel o preceding ß), GROẞER FELDBERG</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>Example for an officially approved name of a municipality
— will continue: Haßfurt, HAẞFURT (though a short and stressed vowel a is preceding ß)</cite></blockquote>
<p>This is, to my knowledge, the first official <strong>German government body</strong> that not only approves but actually <strong>prescribes</strong> the use of uppercase ß (U+1E9E, ẞ), and only accepts the use of SS “temporarily” (“since a typographical implementation of the upper case letter ẞ in the various character fonts will take some time”).</p>

Adam</p>

<p>This is a little bit astonishingly put. That an ẞ “must not” be subsitutet (»darf nicht«) would mean that WEISSENFELS is not acceptable because WEIẞENFELS is right. In practical terms, both versions are right.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Andreas,</p>
<p>well, I think this body (permament council for geographical names, Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen (StAGN), at the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy) is concerned with uniquely identifable names, so there are no ambiguities. For example, the name of the town I used to live in is officially &ldquo;Frankfurt (Oder)&rdquo;. In the past, there were various spellings (&ldquo;Frankfurt (Oder)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Frankfurt/Oder&rdquo;, &ldquo;Frankfurt-an-der-Oder&rdquo;, &ldquo;Frankfurt a.d. Oder&rdquo; etc.), but it seems that the Germans like to have everything normalized, so, well, they also decided to normalize the geographical names.</p>
<p>Which I think makes sense. After all, these days geographical names need to be stored in databases, processed digitally etc., so it&rsquo;s useful to have <em>one official</em> spelling of a geographical name.</p>

Rules: <a href="http://rechtschreibrat.ids-mannheim.de/download/regeln2006.pdf">http://rechtschreibrat.ids-mannheim.de/download/regeln2006.pdf</a>

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Ä Ö Ü</p>
<p>I also must stress that no one should use the term ligature as something intrinsically different than normal letters of the alphabet. This misinterpretation must be based on the fact that we usually just think of the typical f-ligatures.<br>
But “ligature” just refers to a formal connection of some sort: 
<em>From Middle English, from Middle French, from Late Latin ligātura &lt; Latin ligātus, past participle of ligāre (“to tie, bind”).</em> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ligature">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ligature</a></p>
<p>A ligature can serve a typographic function (fi, fl, &hellip;), a decorative function (ct, &hellip;) or it can be an official letter of the alphabet like for example w, œ, æ, … and ß.</p>

<p><cite>3) Ä, Ö and Ü — with lowered accents in many mid-20th century Antiqua fonts.</cite></p>
<p>By the way: The German umlauts had the same development from a lowercase only connection to a full letter of the alphabet. (ß is just a little bit behind, because in blackletter there was no need for it, because blackletter wasn&rsquo;t set in uppercase.)</p>
<p>Here is a book from 1774. The e had moved on top of a, o, and u:

But there was no uppercase version yet: (Ueberlegenheit instead of Überlegenheit)

<p>This stayed this way for some time, but the uppercase umlauts still emerged, because like Adam said: it’s the only logical thing to do. Now we are at the same point regarding the ß. It just took a little longer.</p>

<p>not only good examples but also some beautiful shots of them, thanks! :) Do you have them somewhere in high-res? I&rsquo;d love to use them in a presentation if you don&rsquo;t mind (crediting you of course).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>Yet, i don’t think that names are the foremost concern.</cite></p>
<p>Oh, no, they are! I come from a town called <strong>Pößneck</strong> and we have a battle for decades how it should be pronounced and how it should be written in uppercase texts. It literally splits a whole town.</p>
<p><cite>Of course it does. Herr ROSSBERG (i.e. Rossberg) is pronounced “rosberg” &hellip; while Herr ROßBERG (i.e. Roßberg) is pronounced “ro:sberg” </cite></p>
<p>No, the reform of 1996 doesn&rsquo;t apply to names. On my businesscard is says »Roßbach and Herrmann GbR« and it is still (and will always be) pronounced »Rossbach«.</p>
<p><strong>In our business</strong> the correct spelling of names is the biggest concern in the capital sharp s debate. Just think of all the bibliographies in books. We usually like to set names in small caps, but names have to keep their Eszett, because <strong>Weiß</strong> and <strong>Weiss</strong> are different names.</p>
<p><strong>For the public</strong> this is a solution for a problem that most of the people aren&rsquo;t even aware of. Again: Herr Roßbach from Pößneck will always write ROßBACH and PÖßNECK to keep the proper names. So now we offer him a way to do it with letters that are typographically correct.</p>
<p>About the shape:
I don&rsquo;t think we should define the one and only way of designing the capital sharp s. There are different solutions and over time one will eventually prevail.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>what i really want to know is when are uppercase Latin ligatures coming to Unicode? i need my FFI!</cite></p>
<p>Not sure if that was supposed to be an argument or a joke, but just for the record:
The ß does not belong to ligatures like fi and fl, it belongs to ligatures like w, which (might have evolved from a ligature but) are a an official letter of the alphabet with a distinct phonetic function. And this is no matter of opinion.</p>
