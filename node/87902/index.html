  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all. I've been a lurker here for some time, but I am currently conducting some broad research around the area of board games and would be very grateful if some of you would take the time to fill in a brief (10 question) survey.

The survey can be found at [[http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DQT9VKW]]

I am looking at board games from the point of view of a graphic designer (currently a part-time MA student), and specifically, a typographer (albeit not a very accomplished one). However this survey is very much a general overview of the board game demographic and is not specifically concerned with graphical elements. My reason for posting here is that I would like to try and source information from people who are not necessarily primarily involved with or concerned by board games (unlike, for example, the community at boardgamegeek.com)

I know the whole student-research issue has been a bone of contention around these forums before, but hopefully no-one will find anything to be offended by in this request.

Thank you for your time. </div>

In fact, I almost did a talk on the typography of boardgames for TypeCon this year. (They liked both my talk proposals, but I had to pick one, and I went with the other one.)

In '08 I created and e-published a short volume of chess poems - Chess Poetry Vol.1 ... 

http://issuu.com/graphicdeclaration/docs/chess_poetry_vol1

...chesstastic poems were written and submitted by chess players from around the world. And as for the fonts I chose to use, well, um, ya, what can I say.

Chess Poetry Vol.2 due out this coming holiday season :)

...unfortunately the jpegs were supplied by the client., and of course the budget was like next to nothing, but I had fun with it anyways :)
