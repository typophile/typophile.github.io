  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Typophiles,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on a book design project for Verne&rsquo;s 20,000 leagues under the sea. This project spans over two quarters and an entire summer. So far I am a quarter into the project, our first class was book illustration. So as I&rsquo;m knee deep in getting those illustrations finished before the summer is over I have starting thinking about the next step&hellip; Our next class is typography III which is where we will be typesetting our books, not to mention printing and case binding them by hand. (with a screen printed cover!) As I&rsquo;m sure many of you know the book takes place all around the world in the 1860&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the type for awhile but I thought that typophile would be a good place to ask for any suggestions. I&rsquo;m looking for a very traditional and beautiful full serif typeface with nice ligatures. Maybe something that has a little bit of a modern flair to it. I might also be looking for a San serif that would work nicely with it. Even though im a starving student Ill find a way to get some money together to buy just the right typeface! So with all that out of the way any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,
Aaron</p>

<p>Aar, is there any kind of look, or typeface that you had in mind? How about Minion Pro? I think it&rsquo;s a timeless typeface :D, and it&rsquo;s look good with a lot san serif typeface too. Or go for Proforma if you want to spend some $$. It&rsquo;s very modern.</p>

<p>Does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by hand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refer to the printing as well as the binding? If you&rsquo;re going to print letterpress, will you print from metal type, or make photopolymer plates from type you set digitally?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to print from metal type, your choice will be limited to what they have in your college&rsquo;s print shop. If you&rsquo;re setting it digitally for photopolymer plates, allow for the fact that letterpress &ldquo;bites&rdquo; into the surface of the paper, so thin strokes will get a little heavier when you print them.</p>
<p>This effect is more pronounced on papers with a soft finish (sometimes called &ldquo;vellum&rdquo; or &ldquo;felt&rdquo;), and less pronounced on smooth-finish papers, so be sure to get your professor&rsquo;s advice on the best combination of typeface and paper stock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a preview of your illustrations if you&rsquo;re inclined to post some of them here. When you&rsquo;re choosing your type, [[http://typophile.com/node/58978|consider how it&rsquo;s going to work with your illustrations]] in terms of weight, contrast, and complexity (presence/absence of fussy details).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the book takes place all around the world in the 1860’s. . . . Maybe something that has a little bit of a modern flair to it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Go with your instinct re: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->modern flair<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Verne wrote his stories in the 1800s,  but they remain popular because he set them in a kind of parallel universe. He wasn&rsquo;t constrained by the cultural context of his own century, and neither should you be.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oddly enough, a few years back, we did an illustrated edition of this book for one of the presses affiliated under the University Press of New England. It was designed by Rich Hendel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what fonts Rich used; you could probably find a copy &amp; get some ideas. That aside, my first thought is a good Scotch Roman. With Postscript fonts, I think that pretty much means Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Miller. Metal offers more choices, as, oddly enough, do older photocomp systems.</p>

<p>This is a very good point, I like it!</p>
<p>Here is a sample of one of the illustrations. I&rsquo;m still playing around with the watercolor wash in front of the drawings. The book will be in two color (blue/black) and each chapter will start with an illustration such as this one. I should also mention that the book will be 8x8 with large margins and include little footer notes in italic blue type!</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14_Test_4673.jpg]</p>
<p>Thanks for all the suggestions so far. I&rsquo;m liking miller and proforma, more suggestions welcome! I&rsquo;ll post more of the project as it comes.

<p>My first choice for a Nineteenth century serif would be Miller by Matthew Carter, a great contemporary interpretation of the Scotch types which works very nicely as a text face. And Font Boureau offers some sans to go with it.</p>
<p>An alternative to Miller could be Nick Shinn&rsquo;s ModernSuite Family (a Scotch Serif plus a Sans).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also have a look to Adrian Frutiger&rsquo;s Iridium.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interestingly enough, the title-page of the first French edition of the book (1869-1870) features a typeface which resembles more the Garamond/Humanistic tradition (1600) than the Classical/Didones (1700) or Scotch Roman fonts (1800).</p>

<p>Maybe a Fournier - a wonderful French typeface - could be an appropriate choice for this project too.</p>
