body: "I'm having a lot of trouble finding a sans accompaniment to Bulmer. Perhaps
  unsurprisingly, the available designs based on British grots of the earlier 1800s
  (Bureau Grot, Figgins Sans, Maple), or derived from Baskerville (John Sans, Mr Eaves),
  don't really work. Neo-grotesques all seem too superellipsey, and don't really share
  Bulmer's horizontal proportions anyway. \r\n\r\nThis is for a small British vendor
  of expensive men's accessories. The sans will mainly be used for product specs in
  catalogues - dimensions, the kind of batteries needed, etc. - but there might be
  occasional use on product packaging too. \r\n\r\nAll help will be very gratefully
  received."

  body: Thanks Nick! That's a nice match, though the ideal sans for this job would
    be slightly less friendly - the intended look is fairly austere.
