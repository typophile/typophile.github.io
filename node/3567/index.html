		<div class="commentbody">What wonderful feedback! Alright&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I'd increase the word space.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, it was very needed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Some of the sidebearings (like the Dalet's left) should be zero.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't agree. The terribly small size of the letters makes spacing crucial. Zeroing a sidebearing on any of the letters (I've tried numerous tracking combinations) yields very odd implications. Kerning would be super if I could get it to work&hellip; Haven't mastered that field technically, I'm afraid. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I like your vertical proportions, I just wonder if it wouldn't be better to give the Lamed a 2-pixel ascender.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You're right on. I hate making Lamed &quot;ascenders&quot; (in Hebrew we call them &quot;poles&quot;) too short, it just isn't natural. Look at this caricature from an old Hebrew calligraphy/typography teaching book: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Widths: I think it's better too wide than too narrow, I just wonder if width variance can't be used to diverge the confusable letters even more, like in the Bet versus Kaf. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True, but that is not my main concern about these wider letters. I'm more troubled by the notion it makes the eye linger on them, trying to decode these odd shapes' meanings. I'd hate having to part with this incredible addition to my font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Alef: what about making the top-right arm shorter (coming out from higher up in the diagonal)? That would reduce the distracting symmetry.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've made it assymetrical now, correspondant with the Tzadi, which I believe is a letter meant to be similar to the Alef. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I really like the bravery of the Gimel.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you! It stayed that way from the 2000 version. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The wobble in the Zayin is valuable, but it's too jittery in small bitmaps - I'd try not bringing the down stroke back to the right after the left shift. So basically a flipped Vav (shorter by a pixel) with a flat top added.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shifted the upper pixel back. I don't like the idea of Zayin being too narrow, I want more-or-less similar widths for the letters, because I believe it improves readability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I wonder if the Yod needs to be stronger.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've widened the Yod, Vav and Nun-Sofit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- What about giving the (non-final) Mem an ascending pixel? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That wouldn't be very wise, an ascending pixel would make it seem bigger than the other letters. I've taken off a pixel from the bottom, to emphasize its Mem-ity :&gt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- What can you do to make the Nun less like the Kaf?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've added a pixel on the bottom right edge. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- What about giving the Samekh an extra leftward pixel on top? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nah, I don't want the letters to be too square. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Smart divergence between the Qof and the He.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks! This has also been in the 2000 version. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The final-Mem is too square. Hey, it is a square!

The confusing network in Hebrew is very strong and very pervasive. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I need to make a diagram, like the one I've done for Latin: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&amp;amp;s.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&amp;amp;s.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What would be really nice though is some linguistic data - like at least letter frequencies, or in this case ideally a (long) list of the most frequent Hebrew words.

		<div class="commentbody">Itay, the rationale behind the wide letters is that the overall shape of the letter is preserved, while positioning the dagesh mark in the exact middle of the letter's inner space. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Understand I'm having moral difficulties altering the Pei. :&gt; It simply isn't what I'm trying to acheive in this font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Answering Hrant's unanswered &quot;oddity&quot; question, the shapes of the wide letters are indeed odd, but only because modern Hebrew readers aren't used to wide letters, that are a norm in prayer books and such. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Being a Sevenet compliant, I'm trying to make it more or less wide enough and simple enough to be associated with the simple latin letters of that face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The one-pixel difference is biasing, but in this occurance is also manageable. The base matrix for this font is 5x5 pixels, meaning 25 pixels give an overhaul 100% for a single, average letter. Altering one pixel would affect 4% of the entire composition - that is a lot! And when we're talking about its perimeter, that's almost 6%, and when we're talking about a single edge, well, now we're at 20%! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and also referring Hrant's question about making it bolder - I wouldn't dare making this specific font bolder, but when it comes to making heavy-weight Hebrew fonts, I either strengthen its horizontal strokes, or make both horizontal and vertical strokes bolder.

		<div class="commentbody">Backslanting Hebrew type is quite common lately in Hebrew fonts, perhaps it's so because of the inverse directionality of the language. In any case, slanted/oblique/italic Hebrew fonts are pretty rare in general because there is no true Hebrew &quot;italic&quot;. In an early <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Hebrew<!-- raw HTML omitted --> release (by the late designer Ismar David), an &quot;Italic&quot; style has been suggested, and as you can see it slants to the left, maybe in order to be more compatible with Latin texts (in the link you can also see its beautiful and unreleased &quot;Sans&quot; style I'm currently studying). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is well known that Hebrew letters lack divergence and therefore Hebrew text suffers great readability issues. There have been some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quite bizzare experimentations<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lately but I still haven't seen a better adaptation of the &quot;cursive&quot; style than the example I showed in my previous post.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There seems to be much debate about the direction of italic in Hebrew. I had a discussion a few years back with Tzvika Rosenberg on the subject.</p>
<p>David seems to be the only classic font with a true italic and in this case the italic was forward. However, it is my opinion that a Hebrew italic should be backwards in the same direction as its Latin counterpart for the simple reason that Hebrew cursive script (handwriting) is always written in that direction. If italic fonts are supposed to mimic handwriting, then it only makes sense that this should be the direction of the font.</p>
<p>Tzvika likes to call italics that are in the direction of English fonts, &ldquo;italic&rdquo; and italics that are forward moving (like in David Italic aka MF Ramot in the Masterfont library) oblique. I personally think that this is an incorrect definition, but the debate will no doubt continue.</p>
<p>Fontbit has just released a new text font with real italics called ktifa, which has italics in both directions in order to keep both camps happy I guess!</p>
