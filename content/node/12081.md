  in advance. Its kind of an ID question, but the thing is, I am not even sure a typeface
  exists. I am looking for a typeface that looks like it was carved into a tree \u2014
  as young lovers might do: \u201CRobert [hearts] Betsy,\u201D etc, \u2026 If you
  can help, that would be fantastic. Thanks so much!"

  body: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/ye-olde-block-nf/" target="_blank">This
    font</a> was created specifically to simulate letters incised in wood, although
    its letterforms would suggest a lovesick young man (or woman) with a slightly
    more refined typographic sense than most.

  body: Bethany, I would suggest not so much a font but a technique. Open Photoshop
    type some simple text or use a symbol (like a heart) and apply layer effects to
    create a cutout effect. Make the layer opacity 0% and you will have the layer
    effect with no fill. Find a tree image and apply.
