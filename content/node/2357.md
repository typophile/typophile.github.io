  body: And even if you don&#39;t use it for sample text, you can use it for &#39;guess
    the tv show&#39; games when things start to drag on a friday. <BR> <BR>We&#39;ve
    just about used up all the theme tunes on the net, so now we have this text generator
    which gives you either the lyrics for a theme tume &#40;Top Cat, Dukes of Hazard,
    Hong Kong Phooey etc etc&#41; or the voice over from the opening credits &#40;The
    A-Team, Hart to Hart etc&#41;. <BR>Don&#39;t know what the one BJ quotes is. Maybe
    that was never shown over here? <BR>Apart from that, I looked at around 20, and
    I think there was only one other I didn&#39;t get - did I spend too much time
    watching TV?

  body: 'Excellent BJ, I hate lorem ipsum, it produces to many characters that aren&#39;t
    in proportion to English language, so the color isn&#39;t as accurate. I&#39;ve
    been using a chapter from Alice in Wonderland and sometimes I use: One bright
    day, in the middle of the night  two dead boy got up to fight'
