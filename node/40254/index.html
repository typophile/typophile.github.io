  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m designing a book about the people and places of the west coast of Vancouver Island around the late 1800s to early 1900s and I&rsquo;m looking for text font ideas.</p>
<p>The book will likely be over 300 pages in length and will feature a lot of old images from the period sprinkled throughout the text. The book will likely be printed two colour to gain the sepia look for the photos and will be printed on coated stock. The text itself is more reader friendly than a normal scholarly book and it&rsquo;s intention is to bring the people to life rather than just relate names and dates. So I&rsquo;m looking for a type face that is going to be easy to read over the length of the book and has all the necessary parts (italics, SC, old style fig, etc).</p>
<p>The book will have chapter openers that will be set up as a special spread but other than that it has no subheads in the text although it does have excerpts (which I&rsquo;ll likely just handle by indenting) and some captions (likely just italic).</p>
<p>In preparing a first sample I used Caslon since it was in use during the period. My thinking was that I wanted a &ldquo;heavier&rdquo; face as opposed to a &ldquo;prettier&rdquo; face given the people and places portrayed in the book. The author was not that keen on the type and preferred a sample prepared by a non-designer friend who had used FF Humanist as a text face (which is not really an option IMHO).</p>
<p>Other options I&rsquo;d thought of were Baskerville and Walbaum. I suppose another natural might be Cartier Book although I&rsquo;ve never used it. But I&rsquo;m also open to something new and elegant to satisfy the author&rsquo;s request for a &ldquo;classy&rdquo; look.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for type to make the book more accessible, you may want to go with less contrasty, somewhat more idiosyncratic type, which I wouldn&rsquo;t call Caslon, Baskerville, or Walbaum. You may like <a href=http://www.stormtype.com/>StormType&rsquo;s</a> John Baskerville or Walbaum Text, as they&rsquo;re a bit more interesting than typical interpretations of the sources. Storm&rsquo;s Jannon and Regent could be other options, but I think you may be best off with type with less of an historical model. <a href=http://vllg.com/KLIM/Feijoa/mudTyper+Weights/>Feijoa</a> came to mind, as did <a href=www.ourtype.be>Amalia and Fresco</a> from OurType.</p>
<p>EDIT: And how could I forget the <a href=http://joshuadarden.com/shop/>Freight</a> series?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cartier Book, while undoubtedly Canadian, doesn&rsquo;t sound resonant with the period. A nice dark transitional face is [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=clifford&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|Clifford,]] and if you use all 3 size variants you would get more design mileage. Clifford offers comfort, strength, warmth and that ineffable 19th-century feel, without being dry.</p>
<p>For another face by Rod McDonald, and also fitting in its economy, warmth and color is [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=414154&amp;grab_id=0&amp;page_id=37426&amp;query=laurentian&amp;SCOPE=Fonts|Laurentian,]]
which is narrower, higher contrast, and more oldstyle, but still a comfortable reading type. Clifford has no bold, Laurentian has three weights.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;d back out of the project.</p>
<p>Ignoring the author for a bit: Everybody has their own favorite fonts to fall back on; in this case, mine would probably be a Janson that I&rsquo;ve worked over considerably. Less to do with the particulars of printing in the period, more to do with a general feeling; it is a rugged font, and not out of place in terns of the timeframe.</p>
<p>My problem with Janson is always &ldquo;What to use for display?&rdquo; Something like the Champions, screened in the heavier sizes seems to work passably.</p>
<p>If the author likes the fruity stuff, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like you&rsquo;re going to be happy, with good reason.</p>
<p>Though, just maybe he&rsquo;d like Trinite &amp; would spring the 1,000 euros for the cost? At least you&rsquo;d get Trinite out of it.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If I were given a project like this one, I&rsquo;d be looking for a typeface with oldstyle roots, not too fancy, and with reasonably good weight to handle the coated stock, such as MVB Verdigris, or if you want a Canadian-designed font, then Laurentian as suggested above would be worth trying. Cartier is a beautiful typeface but not right for this.</p>

<p>Edit: Just taking a look at FF Clifford&ndash;yes, that would be a good choice too. It has three optical sizes. Lack of a bold shouldn&rsquo;t be drawback: for book work, the roman, italic and small caps are all you need.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As I have mentioned on other threads, the best way to call up this period is with ITC Bodoni Twelve, from ITC, loaded with oldstyle figures and all the extra weights and glyphs you&rsquo;ll need. Storm&rsquo;s Walbaum is perfect for earlier 19th century, esp German romantic in theme. Storm&rsquo;s Regent II is excellent for this also, but a tad dark and heavy, though the italic is fabulous, esp for display. Janson with oldstyle figures is always great for books, regardless of subject. I love FF Clifford, but releasing such a useful family without bold and bold italic is just moronic, so I have scorned getting it. Ditto Requiem.</div>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about bold. If you&rsquo;re typesetting a book and think you need bold, go out for a walk, breath some fresh air, then come back and tackle the problem again. Ninety-nine time out of a hundred there&rsquo;s a better typographic solution.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Gary, use of bold in book design is a real problem. Especially in academic non-fiction, if the author wants bold, he may well be entitled to it, whatever the book designer thinks, and the publisher does not want to be told the chosen typeface does not offer bold or bold italic. I&rsquo;ve never understood issuing type families with only one weight: Clifford would be selling much more today if it were complete, same with Requiem. The foundry is just being short-sighted.</div>
