  Centennial Publication in the U.S. Midwest. I'm seeking typefaces related to the
  past 100 years of history for the Accounting profession and CPAs. Any fonts used
  in historical ledgers, bank statements, checks, currency or any related topic will
  be much appreciated. Please don\u2019t let the specifics listed limit your response.
  \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMOCPA  \r\n"

    but I recently posted [[http://www.deamplified.com/found/brooklyn-check-typography/|scans
    of some 19th century bank checks]] I found at a flea market.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    in NYC, I can tell you where. They had an entire box full of very old checks,
    deeds, insurance papers, etc."
