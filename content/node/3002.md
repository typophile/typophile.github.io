body: Im designing a magazine for a school project and Im looking for a good text
  face to use throughout. The mag is on stylish nightlife which includes fashion,
  music, and trendy bars and clubs around the world. I want the face to be very clean
  and look fresh.  <BR> <BR>Faces I have been playing around with include news gothic,
  franklin gothic, din, and monotype grotesque. Theyre all great faces and Im sure
  I&#39;d do fine with any of them. I am just wondering what newer faces are out there
  that compare to these faces, especially as far as readability is concerned. Thanks!

  body: Try Priori from Emigre.  It&#39;s both a sans and a serif, though I don&#39;t
    know how readable it would be in a text setting. <BR> <BR>The sans is quite nice,
    reminiscent of Gill Sans but more modern, and the Serif has a nice gothic look
    to it. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=priori" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=priori</a>

  body: I think Priori is too &#34;pushy&#34; to be highly readable. In the Emigre
    library, Eidetic might work better. <BR>What about Proforma? With Amplitude for
    display. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I think our new release Alfon works great as a magazine text face. Several
    users are implementing it in that capacity and it is working nicely. Body &amp;
    Soul was recently redesigned by Hopkins Baumann in NYC and it is using Alfon as
    feature text and display and I think it works great. If you can find a copy on
    the newsstand or in the health food store you should check it out.

    to see it used in a large text setting, however.'

  body: 'I&#39;d certainly love to see some long text set in Priori - it&#39;s one
    of those borderline text faces that needs to be seen in action to know for sure.
    A similar case is Emigre&#39;s &#34;Tribute&#34;: when I first saw it the &#34;g&#34;
    raised a flag, but I had to see it in actual setting to be sure that it is indeed
    too problematic, especially when doubled. Borderline glyphs aren&#39;t so bad
    when they&#39;re in a font with many of them, but when there&#39;s one single
    &#34;spike&#34; it reduces the overall utility of the font with little gain in
    personality/focus. In the case of Priori the &#34;a&#34; seems to be such a spike
    to me - a little too far beyond the &#34;envelope&#34; made by the rest of the
    font, especially when you consider it&#39;s such a common letter. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: '&#62; Body &amp; Soul <BR> <BR>I just checked it out. Alfon seems to work
    really well - better than what your &#40;any?&#41; website conveys. They should
    really use it for the whole thing, and dump that ridiculous Johnston for text.
    My only complaint with Alfon&#39;s Roman is that it&#39;s a bit light &#40;or
    is that from their repro?&#41;, but then I realized that the whole magazine&#39;s
    look is light, so it&#39;s a great fit. As for the Italic, I really like it a
    LOT structurally -very progressive- but I do worry that it&#39;s a bit too close
    to the Roman for emphasis - just a bit. Great stuff overall! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: ouch 235 bucks. Is there any sort of a trial or a student version available?
    I am not doing this for anything commercial and therefore can&#39;t afford many
    typefaces on a student budget. I won&#39;t resort to stealing typefaces. does
    anyone know how someone in my postion can go about obtaining good faces for a
    very low price or better yet even free? I will hapilly buy the faces when I get
    out of school and start actually making money, instead of paying over 30 grand
    a year for education <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    target="_blank">  Eldetic Neo</a> for the text and Fountains  <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ultura_heavy.asp"

  body: I think Eidetic might be a superb choice here. And its proportions and color
    seem very good for magazine setting. But Ultura would not match it - I think you&#39;d
    need something more tame for the headings if your body font is so mannered - or
    what about Eidetic&#39;s unicase? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Yup, that&#39;s it. &#34;Unicase&#34; means a font that mixes UC and lc forms.
    <BR>I don&#39;t usually like them, actually - at least I don&#39;t think type
    designers should generally spend time making them - but once they&#39;re made
    a type <i>user</i> wouldn&#39;t be at fault using them! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: oh i almost forgot, I&#39;m thinking about using a sans for the openers and
    picture captions. I&#39;m thinking it should be pretty simple to contrast with
    the eidetic. Maybe DIN or Thesis? Any thoughts? I can&#39;t wait to start designing
    this thing... its going to be fun <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
