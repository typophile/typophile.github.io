body: "Can someone tell me the fonts used to created this logo. (I know the signature
  is not a font, and that the Guinness name has been manipulated, I'd be happy with
  as close as possible matches.) Please Identify the other 3 fonts excluding Copperplate
  (Draught). Much appreciation! <a href=\"http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/brands/0006/9450/Guiness_Draught.eps\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Guiness_Draught_3882.gif]</a>\r\n<em>edit:

    and then redrew it in illustrator. \r\n\r\nCould the Guinness be Goudy as well? "

  body: "Guiness looks like a Century of some kind; perhaps a manipulated Century
    Schoolbook, which has more heft and less contrast than the rest of the family.\r\n\r\n(Those
    SSs look awfully Times-like, though.)"

  body: Hey, that's pretty cool. It's not a 100% match, but I think it's close enough
    that people will get it! Looks like it's going to be a beer bash of a birthday.

  body: "Maybe raise the apostrophe so its dot is above the N's serif and its tail
    curves around the serif and hangs below. Then you can kern the S and it won't
    be quite so detached.\r\n\r\nHow about some vertical skew on the Bickham Script
    to match the originals signature?\r\n"

    but it was close enough for me.
