<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So, I'm about to overhaul my business identity. The business, Microspective Multimedia, develops small-business identity (my largest draw is artists and complementary health practitioners), plus multifarious print, web, audio, and photo services.
I'm tired of hearing, <cite>"'Microsp... Mediawhat?' What a mouthful!"</cite>, so I'm shortening the name simply to Microspective. Even though the "multimedia" descriptor has been omitted, I figured Google, Flickr, Amazon, etc. don't include their service in their name, so a simplification seemed in order.
Anyway, I've found it difficult to be objective about redesigning my own business identity, so I'd like to solicit your knowledge and experience for opinions on kerning, proportion, and anything else that you find objectionable (or favorable) about this logo.
Thanks in advance for your comments!
Regards,
Ray

<div class=commentbody>"Microspective" is a cool word, and right now none of these seem to take advantage of its aural or visual qualities. It has two i's, and a descender near the middle. I'd like to see you play with that, instead of using a mark that refers to "perspective" but is otherwise meaningless. I'd play with the letter ideas on paper before thinking about what font or color to use.
Good luck! It's hard doing your own business identity - I've been taking almost a year to work on my own.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Your logo is so wide open it's hard to know where to even start. You can do anything. If you want a simple wordmark consider something like this. Good luck.

<div class=commentbody>Hi microspective,
I know, creating an identity for your own business is probably the hardest thing you could ever do. Like eeblet it has taken me more than a year now to develop one for my own design business - and I'm still not happy with it. However, your logo looks pretty perfect to me and it's hard for me to think of anything that could be further improved. I really like typeface you chose and the whole concept adds nicely to that. So I'd say go for it and don't think about it too much.

<div class=commentbody>True, but it took me about a year to get to the level of professionalism that microspective is showing here.
P.S. By the way, eeblet, I just posted a new thread. Please hurry, if you want to be the first one to comment on it ;-)
I can't wait to hear your thoughts on it...

<div class=commentbody>I'm with eeblet.
The word is great, so yea, maybe you don't need to do that much with it. Right now, though the 'm.' mark is just a bit confusing. Why the period? Why is it cropped? Why is it rotated? In other words, it seems purely arbitrary.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The m reads almost more as an E or a B before I see the m.
"Microspective" suggests to me attention to visual detail, precise focus. Could a logo reinforce those ideas?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, I tried a few versions of a magnifying glass element in the logo, but it just looked a little cliché.
I appreciate all these comments. They're great. Keep 'em coming if you have something to add!
Thanks,

<div class=commentbody>Avoid forcing the viewer to figure out what you are intending. The mark you first presented makes no sense to me and I am a designer. Think about a potential client, ask, "Will they get it", right now I'd say no.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd focus less on illustrating the concept of "microspective" and more on illustrating your brand: if your strength is in attention to detail, pick or create beautiful letterforms, and make them perfect. If your strength is on user-friendliness, pick a warm, friendly typeface and do something playful with the dots on the i's. Etc.
Good luck!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually, I like eeblet's idea with the descender near the middle. It may be interesting enough on its own to make a statement.
For instance, Rockport publishers also use this effect:

I prefer the version without the boat though (which I was unable to find via Google).

<div class=commentbody>I like what you've got. There's a lot that could be done playing with perspective but to me that seems a bit too obvious.
