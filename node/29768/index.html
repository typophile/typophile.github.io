  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,
I am currently researching for my dissertation which is about how David Carson has influenced publishing since the 1990’s with Raygun. 
I just wondered if anyone would be kind enough to answer a few questions for me...


Question 1. 
Have you been influenced by Carson? Are there any elements of his work that you have been inspired by?

Question 2.
What did you think of Raygun at the time? (if applicable)

Question 3.
What do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work? 

Question 4. 
How do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?

Thank you </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Q1> I have - Carson's work 'got me into' graphic design... I got addicted to the End of Print, it was THE book when I started college. I was definately inspired by his work, but in a different way to a lot of people, I think - I liked the little quirky touches he applied to things. The one example that immediately comes to mind is the design he did for Speak magazine. Interesting concepts such as having the contents page on the centre spread and having plus and minus page numbering, pages preceding the centre were negative numbers; also, having an article which stopped abruptly in the magzine - the rest of it appeared online. It's easy to dismiss things like that as gimmicky, but it kept really well with the tone of the magazine and I still like the lateral thought behind them!

Q2> I got into RG just after Carson left : ( but in the UK we had BlahBlahBlah magazine which kind of took off where he left off.

Q3> It's inevitable that his deconstructivist approach would be emulated because I remember it stood out so much at the time - people pick up on that.

Q4> I mentioned BlahBlahBlah above, I remember that had a direct link with RG. I think there was a real backlash against the deconstructive style around '98 onwards.

Sorry it's difficult to write too much at the moment because I haven't got much time, but I hope this helps you a little bit.

It's worth checking out TypeRadio, there's a recent interview with DC.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Q1: I think Carson's influence on design has been huge and I credit him for that. He busted it wide open. However, I am NOT a fan either of his work or of the direction he has moved design in. Call me an old fogy but I like to actually read type and don't consider it just another design element. I design in a way that is pretty diametrically opposite to his aesthetic. I'm much more of a minimalist - I believe good design says more with less.

Q2: As for Raygun specifically I really didn't do much more than glance through it. I truly hated his book Cyclops, both for the photography (the awful Albert Watson) and the egregious type design. 

Q3&4: I have much railed and lamented at the way all of a sudden book designers thought it was cool to have the type all squashed together and bleeding off the page and impossible to decipher. Or the above-mentioned TOC in the middle of the book. I think it's calming down now.

So to me he's the design equivalent of rap music - generally kinda hate it, do my best to ignore it, but occasionally there's something that makes me go WOW and I have to grudgingly acknowledge his spot in the pantheon. He is certainly a valid subject for a dissertation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raygun followed any formal education I had. Carson's freedom in breaking rules reflected trends that had been part of fine art for a whle. I had seen these trends and remember being happy in a way to see print explode the way it did.

Being a bit older now, I see the key being that we focus on the craft and the information. If the writer takes a deconstructed approach the design might follow. But, if the writer is formally trying to communicate I feel the design should respect and enhance the effort.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ruth

Where I come from, Carson is a dirty word. Here's why. The seventh form school program in NZ asks students to research a famous designer as an 'artist model' – and design their work according to the aesthetic of that designer. Many of them pick David Carson. The school leavers then apply for places on the graphics undergraduate programs that I teach on. Every year I am confronted with hundreds of pieces of 'rip-off' Carson-esque work produced by impressionable young people who think it's great without ever questioning why it exists in the first place...

To answer your questions

<em>Question 1.
Have you been influenced by Carson? Are there any elements of his work that you have been inspired by?</em>

In terms of style and understanding, Carson's influence on me has been as polarising and negative as his own Swiss School experience was on him. Like James above, I completed my formal training before the advent of 'The End of Print'. The caption that the book contains under two identical pictures run side by side <em>"...this picture was so great we had to run it twice"</em> is inspiring in it's idiocy; I use it to illustrate to my students what not finishing your studies in visual literacy will do to you. 

By the same token, Jessica Helfand's foreword is the only thing worth taking seriously about 'The End of Print'.

<em>Question 2.
What did you think of Raygun at the time? (if applicable)</em>

Unreadable and ugly-looking hyperbole. Which makes me sound just like Massimo Vignelli talking about Emigre. The difference was, Emigre had a point – so it's possible to see their editorial design as a function of their agenda. With Carson's agenda of 'how can I make this a frustrating (or, with the Bryan Ferry spread, an <em>irrelevant</em>) experience for the viewer?' that output is not so much design as fine art posturing pretending to be something else. 

There is a back story, detailed by Rudy VanderLans in Emigre No. 69 'The End', about the critical difference between Carson's earlier Beach Culture and Emigre, which might be worth reading.

It's worth noting that the review pages and the adverts in the back section of RG (i.e. those parts that the publication derived <em>revenue</em> from) were as conventionally-designed as any other magazine of the time.

<em>Question 3.
What do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work?</em>

See above. In that Carson never matriculated, what's the actual distinction between him and the amateurs? If you look at the big-ticket work post RG, such as the Pepsi campaign, you'll see how amateurish he could be.

<em>Question 4.
How do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?</em>

If this is really a question about 'publishing in general' don't talk to the (hired) hand – ask the publishers. If you mean it as a question about changes in magazine editorial design since Raygun, then arguably the design (like the English language in general), has gotten a lot more self-conscious, but actually less precise in its ability to communicate, and it's correspondingly perceived as being more disposable by its consumers.

Good luck with your dissertation.</div>

I can see that, but aren't many design-books-for-designers full of that kind of thing? It's really no different from other offerings in principle, such as Attik's 'Noise' series, or Tomato's 'Bareback'. It's experimentation, playing about and self-indulgent - but it's certainly not limited to a single designer.

No one has mentioned that David Carson's work was (and to an extent) still is, exciting. I think graphic design would have been poorer if he hadn't appeared on the design scene and done what he did. It got me (and I'm sure countless others) into design and injected some excitement and enthusiasm into design at the same time.

I actually think that he opened the door to a lot of people in what can be a very pretentious industry, by the very fact that he didn't get into design through the perceived 'proper' route.

Although it might sound otherwise, I'm not particularly into his way of doing things (especially the questionable legibility issue, I could never swallow the 'if you have to dechipher it, it'll sink in better' line); ultimately the fact that this question was raised shows that he's left an indelible mark on graphic design (especially mid 90s design). Things have moved on, the backlash happened (and continues), but above all I remember being blown away by the designs at the time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, and for that I give him credit. But the original post asked for comments both on his influence on design and publishing in general and also on our personal opinions and reactions to this influence. In the right context Carson has done some amazing groundbreaking work (whether or not I like it) however his approach has unfortunately been applied somewhat indiscriminately to poor effect. There were some really hideous Type Directors Club Annuals back in the day. But that's the problem with trends in general, they can't avoid getting diluted and kitschy after awhile. When your client starts asking for a "David Carson" kind of look you know it's probably time to try something new.</div>

And when they wanted to communicate, instead of show off, they were legible. 

I find this kind of design annoying; ignoring the needs of the reader to me seems self-indulgent and supercilious. Maybe Carson and others are not that way personally, but to me the designs exude that attitude.

edit: this is a reaction to the imitations of Carson. I don't actually know his work.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Magazines like Raygun have a very different audience than the more well known ones. The surferzine types probably didn't really buy the mag for reading text. It was a cool in-thing to have on your surfboard tabletop. David Carson was actually a collage artist (and good at it) not a publication designer. He made tone-poems with type and photo fragments.  The level of communication was all about visual tactile senses, not about conveying any specific information. His work was outrageous enough to get noticed for both good and bad reasons.  He was good at making typographic paintings but nowhere near as good at it as April Greiman and she also could communicate intended messages clearly.
Has he been an influence on me in my design work? No, not really--to me he is an artist, not a graphic designer.

Raygun is a collection of Carson's printmaking art and served to make the Basel school Weingart emulators look mainstream instead of avante garde.

Wanabbes have always been and always will be. Eventually the talented kids grow up and become themselves. The untalented kids just find someone else to emulate fearing their own ability. 

Publishing has not changed because of Carson. It has changed because of the technology.

PS: I am an old fart so I was too old to be impressed by Raygun.  When I was young, I was impressed by Gerbauchgrafik (sp?).</div>

When I was a student I was influenced by him. However, just like oil and water, his aesthetic and mine never mixed. 

<em>Question 2. What did you think of Raygun at the time? (if applicable)</em>

I thought it fit the mood of the music and scene it was covering. Rolling Stone at the time was really struggling, IMHO, with design and content. I think Raygun filled a needed niche. I bought Raygun for quite a while. I actually wish I still had the first year or at least the first issue. 

<em>Question 3. What do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work?</em>

It is just like anyone else trying to emulate someone they admire. Sometimes it is successful and sometimes it is just appropriated.

<em>Question 4. How do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?</em>

Design for the music world absorbed the style and occasionally resuscitates it when needed. I wouldn't say it had a long-felt influence though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At this point, it might be fair to let the work (seeing as William doesn't know it) speak for itself; here's a comparison of two book covers produced 24 years apart. 

On the left, the original design by Quentin Fiore, 1967 © Bantam Books. On the right, the redesign by David Carson, 2001 © Jerome Agel. (BTW, I should point out that Carson was only hired to redo the cover, not the internal pages, which were a straight reprint of the original). 

Feel free to critique them both, perhaps starting with the question about the economy of means...

		<div class="commentbody">Question 1.
Have you been influenced by Carson? 
No, I'm not influenced by other designers.

Are there any elements of his work that you have been inspired by?
It's nice to know that there are designers pushing the limits, doing their own thing.
What impressed me most about Raygun and Emigre was that they used experimental indie-foundry fonts. That was an influence I suppose, to make experimental fonts, although my experiments weren't the kind that DC would be likely to use.

Question 2.
What did you think of Raygun at the time? (if applicable)
Brilliant!

Question 3.
What do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work?
I think you'd have to look at a piece individually, and give it a thorough analysis, to know just what the designer is trying to do -- unless they're doing a complete rip-off of something in particular. But working in the manner or style associated with DC, the work must be judged on its own merits. Also, bear in mind that there were many other folk in the early 90s doing similar stuff. 

Question 4.
How do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?
There are a lot of "post-literate" publications now, and experiments with what kind of form a periodical can take. But again, you can't pin it all on DC.

		<div class="commentbody">Carson can't be blamed for the fact that it's absurd to redesign the cover of that book - the original cover is of a piece with the design of the entire book and IMHO should have been preserved as such. It may look a little dated but it fits. I love that book.

Carson's redesign... I dunno - hyphenating Inventory is just a bit too cute for me. I guess Din is today's Helvetica. I'm also not a fan of the inconsistent use of caps in the authors names - to me that doesn't comment on the content of the book in a meaningful way. It tries too hard. But like I said, there's probably no way to update the original appropriately.</div>

I hate facsimiles that aren't, irrespective of the "design quality" of the new bits.
But for purists the 1967 original can easily be purchased for $10 (plus shipping).

Somewhat ironic, as DIN pre-dates Helvetica, and Helvetica is today's best-selling font :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have the original, as well as "I Seem to Be a Verb", by Bucky Fuller, from 1970, also designed by Quentin Fiore - which had two covers. It's about the coolest book ever altho the binding does not hold up well. I buy it for all my friends and can't believe nobody has brought it back in print.

I'm a book designer - and specialize in illustrated books, in which the cover is an indispensable part of the whole package so it pains me to see this sort of disconnect.

I didn't know Din predated Helvetica. Fancy that. But since Helvetica is packaged into every computer, it's not fair to compare.

I would recommend switching subjects if its not too late, because for a man who is so respected— to blatantly disrespect students and education— if I can be so bold— does not deserve admiration. I find the man to have exhibited self-importance on a grand scale. There are far too many other great designers out there who respect education, and other human beings in general.

Well, OK, I was influenced in that statement by Emory Douglas, former Minister of Culture of the Black Panthers, who was asked at TypeCon 2004 in San Francisco who his design influences were, and he said none, the main thing is to get the message out.

And I had the privilege of working for Raymond Lee for a year in 1980, who I consider my mentor as a designer, and I still occasionally find myself thinking "How would Ray do this?" or "Ray wouldn't like that!"

But the question here is all about blood-sucking and hero-worship, so what I mean is I don't try to model my work on somebody else's, but go out of my way to try to do something different. So maybe that's like DC after all!</div>

He was definitely playing the trash-the-hotel-room rock-star persona during that time.

He leaves a legacy of this. I've heard other similar stories. I just get so tired of hearing about this guy because designers like to talk about him like he's Jesus Christ himself. He's just a dude, and an a$$hole at that. 

I've had the pleasure of meeting some other design legends and people I have admired who were nothing but gracious, kind, and generous with their time— which is why the idolization of this guy ticks me off so much. The good work he may have done is tainted by his less than exemplary antics.

Unreadable. 
Design without function is dull

Question 3.
What do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work?
Many amateur designer think that he is good and try to do what he does. The result is very awfull. Remember grid is important into design. 


Question 4.
How do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?

its still the same. Publishing try to make their magazine readable and legible.

And Nick, <em>'What impressed me most about Raygun and Emigre was that they used experimental indie-foundry fonts.'</em> 

As far as I'm aware, Emigré, like the other indie foundries, had an open-door policy that encouraged and sponsored beginners like Barry Deck and many others. I think DC commissioned <a href="http://typophile.com/wiki/Typophile%20type%20designers">Miles Newlyn</a> to make the RG fonts, rather than do them himself, but I don't believe that the man who once claimed 'No Emigré fonts used in this issue!' was really keen on supporting other players in the indie foundry scene.</div>

Ben,
You could certainly say that. His work always seemed like he picked up left-over slices of printed paper from below the paper cutter and made a collage of them. I think their might have been a proportion of his readership who were in chemically altered states and were not tuned in to actually reading the words very often :-)

As for the horror stories, some of them are true. He abandoned a yearly course after just three weeks. The students, foaming at the mouth with rage, tried demanding their money back. He's also notorious for not returning illustrators' works.

Hah. My interactions with him were brief, so I can't say anymore. 

I used to bump into him in the Art Directors Club, NY bathroom at event openings. Haven't seen him since I stopped participating in these organizations, and that's a while ago.

--------------------------------------

Anyway, as pointed out his typography is generally bad. The Albert Watson book and the ads he did for Armani watches (if I recall correctly) were atrocious. 

He also worked on the Lucent Technology commercials, where the guy is typing his thoughts out onscreen. Can't recall the typeface he used...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I saw him once give a presentation on his work at our local AIGA chapter. He seemed a bit bored and distracted. I took it as just being travel-weary and having to give the same speech yet one more time. I do recall that a very attractive and provacative looking women came up to him as he was about to leave the stage. She handed him her card in that oh, so, transparent way. Carson just gave her card back without hesitation--along with a cold, dismissive look.
He didn't stick around for drinks and munchies.

		<div class="commentbody">Question 1.
Have you been influenced by Carson? Are there any elements of his work that you have been inspired by?

<em>Yes. the post-photographic treatment of type, working it into and out of the POV, I find interesting. Additionally, I find the fact he makes a successful living at making type "risky" inspiring.</em>

Question 2.
What did you think of Raygun at the time? (if applicable)

<em>It was pretty, but only occasionally was it successful in using the look to tell the story. However, it was fun, the few issues I've gotten to see.</em>


Question 3.
What do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work?

<em>Ooooooh, I hate 'em. But not as much as the professionals that do, then claim they don't.</em>


Question 4.
How do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?

<em>It created a trend. Is publishing really influenced by design, or just a broker of it?</em>


---

I have to say, without any familiarity with the book, that looks like a horrible example of Carson's work. <em>Perhaps</em> the superemphasis of "marshall" has a subtext inside the book that makes a clever gimmick, but overall he has much better pieces.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, pretty. Different people have different aesthetics. Just like rock n roll was once considered "devil music" or "just noise", but now its best examples are appreciated critically, Raygun was trying to communicate the same idea in print.

I'm sure that my choices in fashion, art, architecture, while they seem pretty or pleasant to me, are grating to others. For solid sorta-recent examples, look at Nine Inch Nails's The Downward Spiral liner art and music videos, they are all excellent examples of a very pretty sort of ugly.

thanks for answering my questions they have been of great help for my dissertation. 
but i wondered if you would be able to answer me on more question. 

For those of you who were aware of Raygun at the time it was published, What did you think of it? the style? the content? did you go out and buy the magazine every month? and has your opinion of Carson changed over the last 15 years?

thanks </div>

At the time, I thought it was cool and hip, too, but I also saw it as part of an experiment with the computer that almost needed to happen; an irrational fever that needed to run its course. While everyone saw it as a style, I preferred to think of it as a philosophical challenge, maybe a bit haphazard and misguided, but no less valid to me now... A bit dated in the way when one revisits older photos and asks, what was I thinking and wearing at 18!...</div>
