  got this font, but the ligatures \"fl\" & \"fi\" don't work, even if they are integrated
  to the font. \r\n\r\nYou can try it with the preview there, it's the first font,
  by Bitstream : http://www.myfonts.com/search/classical+garamond/fonts/#item_2\r\n\r\nWhen
  you type \"fi\" & \"fl\" in the preview, and you select to display the ligatures
  in the options, they don't work.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: I too have this font and they work for me. What programme and OS are you using?
    Or are you just talking about the display on the website, that may just be a limitation
    of the html used to generate the previews.

  body: "That is odd, and lacking the option to preview ligatures, I can only assume
    that the version they are selling doesn't have any -- which I find hard to believe.
    The same font from other vendors on that page have an option for ligatures in
    a drop-down to the left of the wheel at the right of the header box, but the BT
    version is missing that. Ligatures work fine in the fonts from other vendors.\r\n\r\nYour
    next move should be to contact MyFonts Tech Support."

  body: "Bitstream's Classical Garamond family indeed includes the 'fi' and 'fl' characters,
    but NOT the OT features that automatically substitutes your typing of 'fi' with
    the ligature of 'fi', etc... they are older TrueType files produced prior to OT
    aware applications... thus, you will need to manually insert these characters
    via Indesign's 'Glyph' panel or similar interfaces in other programs.\r\n\r\nSee
    here for specs on the Regular style: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/classical-garamond/classical-garamond/specs.html

    body: InDesign has no problem understanding and auto-inserting the 'fi' & 'fl'
      ligatures from older Type 1 and (I think) Truetype fonts as long as the're correctly
      encoded, which the Bitstream fonts are.
