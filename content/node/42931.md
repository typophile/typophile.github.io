  body: "That's a pretty rough rendering, but it is at least related to <a href=\"The
    URL\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/american-uncial/</a>.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    David Nalle offers his version as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=manegrim\"
    target=\"_blank\">Manegrim</a>.\r\n\r\nEdit #2: The American Uncial most folks
    are familiar with is actually a digitization of what was originally called, I
    believe, Hammer Uncial (Victor Hammer, 1953)."
