  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi <BR> <BR>I am looking for some feedback and opinions, so this seemed like the place to come. <BR> <BR>Some of you will have heard of the Building Letters magazine which I am involved in, for those of you not aware of it, it is an annual publication, which includes a magazine, a CD of typefaces and a couple of posters, it is sold to raise money for charity projects. <BR> <BR>You can find out more info here : <a href="http://www.buildingletters.org" target="_blank">http://www.buildingletters.org</a> <BR> <BR>Anyway, the India issue has been out for about a month, and the response has been terrible. We have sold only about 80 copies, which doesn&#39;t give us much to donate to the charities we want to support, so I wondered if I could get some feedback on where I might be going wrong, the content, the price, the fonts or the way that the pack is sold? <BR> <BR>I really want to make this project work, so your feedback would be most useful. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jim, I&#39;ve been emailing you for a while, asking about this, and the publication date, and have received nothing back. The Building letters site said that issue 2 was coming soon a very long time ago &#40;like newlyn.com:-&#41;and I gave up checking. <BR>I&#39;ve seen nothing about issue 2 on any design portal etc. <BR>I think it really needs a HEAVY promotional push, lots of press releases to all the design websites and magazines. I&#39;ve put a link to the site on newlyn.com.</div>

I think the price is very reasonable for what you get, but you should consider that your small sacrifice will go a long way toward improving the quality of life of people who can&#39;t post regularly on typophile. Not to get too &#34;We are the world&#34; on you, but to say anyone who reads or posts on this site is &#34;too poor at the moment&#34; to do a bit of good and at the same time feed your insatiable &#34;typophilia&#34; ...is a rather lame. <BR>There are 4738 registered users on Typophile and probably a &#34;few&#34; lurkers. <BR>Do I have to kick some &#149;&#149;&#149; here?

		<div class="commentbody">Jim, I have to admit that after the first issue, it kind of fell off my radar. <BR> <BR>I think interesting fonts for a low price will pull in designers. You might want to think about the &#39;what you get&#39; more than the &#39;what it does&#39;. Good or bad, I think the fonts and posters are the draw, and the charity is the bonus when it comes to designers. We tend to be a socially conscious &#40;if not socially active&#41; bunch, so that works in your favor. <BR> <BR>Well, regardless, you got me too! The magazine looks fascinating, and the fonts look great. I just ordered a copy a few minutes ago. &#40;However, I didn&#39;t see your little Typophile treat until after. Shucks.&#41; I&#39;ll keep an eye out for issue #3. Keep up the inspiring work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is a book distributor in Frankfurt called zweitausendeins &#40;<a href="http://www.zweitausendeins.de/" target="_blank">http://www.zweitausendeins.de/</a>&#41;. They have a dreadfully ugly website, but carry a lot of design books. My professor recommends them. Then there is Vera Kopp &#40;<a href="http://www.koppmedien.de/" target="_blank">http://www.koppmedien.de/</a>&#41;, another big distributer of design books in Germany. They are Emigre&#39;s official distributor, I think.</div>
