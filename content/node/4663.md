body: Over on <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/34792.html">this
  thread</a>, I imagined some new approaches to glyph spacing &#40;inspired by some
  suggestions from Laurence Penney on comp.fonts some years ago&#41; and possible
  tool interfaces for &#39;kern-free&#39; spacing. For the time being, though, it
  looks like we&#39;re stuck with kerning, and the metal type metrics paradigm that
  makes kerning necessary. So, having spent a lot of the past three weeks kerning,
  here is my dream of the perfect kerning &#39;environment&#39;, the Pankernopticon.
  <BR> <BR>One of the major problems of kerning in typical font tools like Fontographer
  and FontLab on typical computer monitors &#40;even very high resolution screens
  like <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=-840&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=9503DG5&amp;storeId=1">this
  one</a>&#41; is that rounding errors make it impossible to accurately preview the
  effect of kerning adjustments in context. In order to accurately preview the kerning,
  one needs a one-to-one relationship between screen pixels and the upm height of
  the font. For a typical TT font with a upm of 2048, this means that one needs to
  preview the kerning at a sufficient size such that, if the whole height of the em
  is to be seen onscreen, the minimum height of the kerning window is 2048 pixels
  &#40;ignoring for now the fact that one often wants to see stuff beyond the limits
  of the em height&#41;. In a smaller window, one can zoom in on the type, so that
  it is large enough, but then one cannot see the context of the kerning pair or even
  the full height of the glyphs. In order to accurately preview kerning in a useful
  way, one would need a monitor that is tall enough to display one pixel to one font
  unit, and wide enough to display a string of letters in a sample word or sequence
  of key letters. So the central feature of the Pankernopticon is a very large, wide
  screen, say 2,400 pixels high and 19,200 wide. <BR> <BR>In order to properly view
  letter sequences on such a screen, one would need to be at an appropriate distance,
  as in the cinema, and the screen should curved to avoid perspective distortion at
  the extremes. The operator would be seated at a console at e.g. 25 feet from the
  screen. <BR> <BR>The console would be similar to a video-editing suite. The main
  controls would be a character selection tool, probably a pointing device, a keyboard
  for entering text strings or stepping through pre-loaded kerning word lists, and
  a Kerning Dial. The latter is the means for adjusting the space between two letters
  on the screen. <BR> <BR>The chair would be comfortable.

  body: '&#62; the minimum height of the kerning window is 2048 pixels <BR> <BR>But
    you have to remember that virtually nobody kerns down to the EM, not even in 1000
    units. I&#39;m certifiably anal, and I only go down to 2 &#40;in 1000&#41;, and
    usually I stop at 5. You might say that 5 is an odd number so you need the single-unit
    addressability, but that&#39;s a decimal hang-up; meaning that I should just use
    4 or 6 instead. So a height of 1024 &#40;assuming TT&#41; is plenty, I think.
    <BR> <BR>But I agree on the necessity for width, even though it&#39;s about as
    far away as the technology in Minority Report - or maybe not: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3688569.stm"
    target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3688569.stm</a> <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    something else, too: to me the biggest factor in quality kerning testing is the
    &#34;data&#34; of what should surround the pair at hand; control strings are too
    far removed from real language, so we need to formulate lists for each pair that
    are based on the &#40;relative&#41; color density on each side; like for &#34;av&#34;
    you might have &#34;ravish&#34; &#40;tight on both sides&#41;, &#34;beaver&#34;
    &#40;loose on both&#41;, etc. The good news is this is cheap to do. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I use sample words for kerning Latin, Cyrillic and Greek, and plan to make
    lists for other scripts/languages as I find time or as projects require. I agree
    that having a secondary set to test kerning in multiple contexts would be a good
    idea, but even single of single sample words using each pair is closer to &#39;real
    language&#39; than control strings, which I gave up using many years ago.

    strings to set up the initial base spacing, like for &#34;n&#34;, &#34;o&#34;,
    etc.? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
