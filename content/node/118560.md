  body: "Recreation seems the most feasible way of doing this. The font has similarities
    to Futura http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/ and Twentieth Century
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/twentieth-century-mt/  Both have close numbers
    as well as letters. Another good candidate is Geometron -- very good for the letters,
    skip the numbers.  https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marius-mitran/geometron-pro-angular/
    \ Any of these three could be modified to replicate the design.\r\nUPDATE:\r\nThe
    numbers in Odessa https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/odessa/ are pretty close if
    you delete the shadow effect.\r\nDon"

  body: Yes, and since the shadow is never connected to the digit, deleting it is
    quite easy.

    as reducing the serif on _1_ should only take a few more minutes. The time required
    depends on whether an absolutely perfect match is desired.\r\nDon"
