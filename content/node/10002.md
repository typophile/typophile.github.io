  out there. I feel like I have seen it before. <BR> <BR>There are some consistencies
  to lead me to believe that it is a font. <BR> <BR>Any clues?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68313.jpg"

  body: BTW this is either hand drawn or set in a very amateuristic font, <BR>so probably
    freeware, so extremely hard to locate.

  body: I think it&#39;s your duty to tell whoever wants this font &#40;client, friend&#41;
    that using it constitutes a quality of life crime. There are plenty of lovely
    Art Nouveauish fonts, check out the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/solotype/?idtype=foundry&amp;itemsperpage=100&amp;resultcount=113&amp;page=1"

    vectorizing of these letterforms - awful!

  body: There&#39;s a much nicer version of this done by Dave Farey called <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?3UY"
    target="_blank">Blackfriar</a>. The freebie fonts mentioned above must have been
    based on the credits on the tv show. The low quality is probably due to trying
    to work off blurry video images. I seem to recall that Dave did the lettering
    for the Blackadder titles and later made a font based on that work.
