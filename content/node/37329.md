  body: "it was a great presentation. a lot of the ususal House history lesson, but
    i really enjoyed what they showed about their involvement with Eames and the new
    Girard fonts. Rich said a couple of interesting things:\r\n1) he made the claim
    that noone else does the OT thing quite as well as House. i agree that they do
    it very well, but are they THE best? i'm not sure...\r\n2) he said that they now
    try to include some fonts suitable for text with each release. i thought this
    was quite an interesting approach, and looking back at their last few releases,
    you can see that this is the case. it was one of those things that i kind of knew
    in my mind, but didn't fully realize until Rich said it. I really this approach:
    marketing a set of related typefaces that include both text and display faces
    with a similar flavor. i hope this kind of thing catches on more."

  body: "I'm glad (or bitter) that you got to go to the House AIGA presentation. :-)\r\n\r\nMy
    train leaves to Albuquerque this Saturday. I'll be there for 2 weeks. I wonder
    if any House stuff will still be there on display.\r\n\r\nI have noticed the a
    \"textual\" trend at House too. Display faces are one trick ponies and go out
    of fashion much faster than a text face. Their new text systems are fabulous.
    Paperback, Neutraface, and Luxury all seem like the forerunners of this new trend
    and look like they have lots of longevity to their design.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
