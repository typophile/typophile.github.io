  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi guys – long time reader, first time poster.</p>
<p>First off, I’d like to let you all know I really enjoy reading your posts regarding logo critique. I happily spend many hours reading (and learning) though your various comments.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I could get your feedback on the logo below. I was asked (as a free favour) to design a logo for this start up marketing consultancy company. The name of the company is Caerus – named after a Greek god of opportunity who was known for having a single lock of hair on the front of his bald head. The logic is that as opportunity approached one could only grab it from the front (his single lock of hair), if it passed, you would miss it (only grabbing his bald head and unable to catch him). Does that make sense?</p>
<p>The client wanted to have an abstract mark, nothing too flash as she wants something “down to earth”. She also wasn’t afraid of white space (“big fan of white space”). She also mentioned that because it’s only a small start-up her font of choice will probably be Calibri.</p>
<p>My initial sketches didn’t produce anything too spectacular, but a lot of my focus went into the actually abstract look of the Caerus god, as I was finding it difficult to convey “grabbing opportunity” visually as well as keeping it abstract.</p>
<p>In the end, I got a decent sketch of the Cereus god with his single lock of hair and then moulded it together with pieces of the Calibri font to help tie it in to her chosen font.</p>
<p>Could you please provide me any feedback or other possible directions I could take this? I’m still a student at graphic design school, so please excuse my amateur attempt, I’m still learning :)</p>
<p>Cheers,
Manny</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I keep wanting to read the mark as an &lsquo;a&rsquo; or &lsquo;al&rsquo;, then I wonder why the company name starts with &lsquo;C&rsquo;. I would either make it more obvious that it&rsquo;s a face/head with hair, or make it look like a &lsquo;C&rsquo; (or at least not like any other letter).</p>
<p>Also, I would highly advise trying to convince the client to not use a system font that everybody has installed for their company logo. It may be a startup, but good fonts can be had for $15 to $50. The cost is well worth the perceived increase in professionalism.</p>
<p>That being said, I like the colour scheme and layout of the red card.</p>

<p>Yes, I totally agree about your comment regarding the fonts, and I will mention this to her. Any suggestions for a suitable font change?</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing your next round of designs. This project is an interesting challenge.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments Kirsten.</p>
<p>Yes again, I agree. It really helps getting some fresh eyes to give you that new perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to work in a more &ldquo;C&rdquo; like shape into the designs as well as a couple of attempts to make the face look, well&hellip;more like a face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally liking the look of &ldquo;A&rdquo; (see attached png), I think it&rsquo;s simple, gives the impression of a &ldquo;C&rdquo; and hopefully comes across looking like a lock of hair.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">C. does nothing for me, B. looks like a Mardi Gras mask, A. The symbol doesn&rsquo;t look at all like a lock of hair. Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t need to. I had no idea who Caerus was until this post, an abstract symbol may be more appropriate than a representational one. However all that said, you really shouldn&rsquo;t continue without making a determination about the font. The font should influence the icon design and vise versa. It&rsquo;s a bad practice to work on a graphic, refine it and then just slap down type next to the graphic.</div>
