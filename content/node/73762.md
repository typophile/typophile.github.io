  finally sketched out all the letters, I'd really appreciate some critique on the
  overall design of the letters before I move on to spacing/kerning/doing more weights.\r\n\r\nIn
  the design, I've tried to mimic several features of monospaced typefaces, keeping
  the typeface condensed, however allowing wider charecters like m, M, w and W. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/array_bold_preview_4386.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  guess its not a good thing that I created the Bold weight first, but I guess a way
  to make it into a whole familiy would be to make a Light weight, and then use interpolation
  to create a Regular weight.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll like it, but please do not hesitate
  to point out the weak parts of it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAnders"

    than the rest of the face.\r\nTo me, s looks like it may be leaning a tiny bit
    to the right.\r\nThe ceiling of P and R sags a little; I'd extend the horizontal
    curve-handles."

  body: "Thanks for your comments Kevin they have been helpful,\r\n\r\nHere's an update.
    You were totally right about the width of f and t. My changes are subtle, but
    should make a difference.\r\nI did some corrections on P, R, s aswell and finished
    the nordic glyphs and some more punctuation.\r\n\r\nNext step would be to do alot
    of laser prints and check the widths of the stems/curves. Unless there are more
    design issues?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/array_bold_preview2.jpg]"
