  Ministry Of Sound logo (link below). As far as i can see it isn't a typeface done
  by Dalton Maag but i could be possibly very wrong. I couldn't find anything related
  online as well. Thanks in advance for any help and/or pointers in the right direction.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nrab\r\n\r\nLink

  body: Thanks Conor, it does have some similarities with Barmeno, although the MoS
    typeface looks more square-ish, has different stroke widths as well as a more
    curvy foot on the R. But if it's really custom I think Barmeno could do the job
    as well. Thanks again!

  body: "it reminded me of Barmeno as well Conor - but Dalton Maag being Dalton Maag,
    I'd be fairly sure it is custom.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.brandsoftheworld.com/brands/0006/8843/Ministry_of_Sound.eps\r\n\r\n<em>
    Dalton Maag were asked to provide the typography for this well known UK music
    label. We initially supplied various typographical routes with the one currently
    in use being crafted to work well in different sizes and applications. The most
    challenging aspect was to ensure that the type works well on the curve of the
    logo. </em>\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, I read that bit at Dalton Maag's site as well mmoran, initially I expected
    it to be a custom font as well but I also expected it to be listed here if that
    would be the case:\r\nhttp://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/custom/\r\n\r\nThen again,
    I assume *all* custom fonts would be mentioned, but could be dead wrong here.
    Assuming it's custom I think I'll go with Barmeno, nice alternative. Thanks again
    guys."

    can find are Barmeno BQ and Barmeno BE (what's the difference?).\r\n\r\nAnd yeah
    you're totally right Nick, I was thinking too much in terms of typefaces without
    realizing that Dalton Maag may very well just have done a hand full of characters
    in this case. And if that's the case Dalton Maag <strong>should</strong> make
    it into a typeface!"

  body: "I designed the letters for the Ministry Logo. It isn't a font. They use to
    use Times but I refined their logo and they chose my design. So I designed the
    letters to go with it. It was a bit tough to make it work on an arch but it was
    finalized then made into an eps file in Illustrator from the letters made in Fontographer
    I believe since it was before FontLab might have been finished.\r\n\r\nI was trying
    to pick-up how they wanted to round off the logo and the way they changed the
    inner holes of the globe.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hey Vince, good to know. Thank you very much for the info. Now it officially
    is a custom job! Yay! I did actually see your blog in the google results when
    i was searching for it. However other than a link to MoS I couldn't find anything
    else on your blog nor is it mentioned on your own site that confirmed this so
    i thought you did some other type work for MoS.

    But why isn't this in your online portfolio?
