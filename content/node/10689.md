  set of motions  <BR>from design to submission and hopefully distribution  <BR>in
  the pursuit of gaining experience in doing so -  <BR>dealing with foundrys, prepping
  the file etc.  <BR> <BR>I am hoping to be fully prepared when I am <BR>finished
  with more serious designs. I want to <BR>have this experience under my belt when
  the <BR>time has come. <BR> <BR>If no one likes it, I&#39;ll sell it on Myfonts.com.  <BR>Yet
  another experience to be learned. <BR> <BR>I am not as interested in a critique
  of the  <BR>design so much as what I should or should  <BR>not be doing in my presentation.
  &#40; I think  <BR>someday I will regret having designed this.&#41;  <BR>But some
  comments are welcome if you really  <BR>think it should be said. <BR> <BR>In my
  email, to the place that I will be  <BR>submitting it to, I will include my inspiration
  for  <BR>the design, through contact info and... <BR> <BR>what else? What should
  I leave out? <BR> <BR>WHERE SHOULD I SEND IT? <BR> <BR>-smc <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: Stephen, <BR> <BR>It is called Mofle. It means Muffler in Spanish. <BR>Thus,
    Mofle Loose, Mofle Expanded,  <BR>Mofle Dropped. <BR> <BR>It is inspired by the
    hand painted lettering on  <BR>the Muffler and Hub shops in the Barrios  <BR>around
    town. There are lots of low-riders  <BR>around. I drive a 66&#39; Chevel myself.
    <BR> <BR>And yes, The difference between regular and  <BR>expanded is spacing.
    I should get rid of  <BR>regular maybe. The letters need space being  <BR>all
    caps any way. My thinking was the wide  <BR>family would make it  more marketable.
    That,  <BR>along with the shadow and extended  <BR>character set such as fractions
    I  <BR>am hoping will make it more appealing  <BR>compared to similar designs.
    <BR> <BR>The text by the way is a complete joke. <BR>Typeheads will know that
    right? <BR> <BR>-smc  <BR>

    you could include a page of things you might see it using. I mean designs. Book
    Jacket, Magazine cover, Advertisement, etc. <BR> <BR>You could do a version called
    dropped too. I really like the chopped. The dropped could have an even heavier
    stroke/space inbetween the shadow and the letterform. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Gracias Amigos.  <BR>  <BR>&#62;Mira, how you do your traps, eh?   <BR>To
    be honest, I really don&#39;t know what I am doing as far as traps go. I just
    looked around at some faces that had them and went by that. But really, does this
    design need traps? Again, it is kind of a joke.  <BR>  <BR>&#62;...you could include
    a page of things you might see it using.  <BR>  <BR>Oh yea. I forgot to do that.
    But do you think this is too much? I recall that you &#40;Tiffany&#41; saying
    something like you have looked at more type submissions than you care to think
    about. Brevity might be a good thing if this is the case.  <BR>  <BR>&#62;You
    could do a version called dropped too.  <BR>I&#39;ve got it.  <BR>  <BR>But I
    still have that awful spacing issue.  <BR>  <BR>See &#60;a href=&#34;<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/7436.html?1047509741"

  body: '<i>&#40;BTW, I don&#39;t get why this thread has had <BR>virtually no participation.
    What to put in a specimen is a huge question.&#41;</i> <BR> <BR>Forgive me Sean
    for restating what I said in my email to you. After having read this thread and
    all those leading up to it, my impression is that the Mofle specimen is about
    the right size for an unknown designer. How did I draw this conclusion? <BR> <BR>It
    seemed to me a trend from previous threads is that as a designer becomes more
    well known, they need to submit less. Duh. JFPorchez gave a good example of that
    trend: <BR> <BR><i>The first time I submited &#40;as described&#41; a typeface
    it was longtime ago, probably Angie, my first one to FF. In fact, I just send
    the a basic character set &#40;suh panels done for Morisawa, it was in 1990&#41;.
    But this was before I start to design with computers. They don&#39;t have done
    any comments, I just decided how many weights, etc.  <BR> <BR>Then, i submited
    Anisette to FB circa 1995/96, there, they asked for hamburgefonstiv and some others
    trials if you have, such weights, etc.  <BR> <BR>Then, they reviewed it and ask
    for corrections, etc.  <BR> <BR>Now, its my own boss who decide if he accept my
    designs, generally he is quite cool with me and we have same feelings on letterforms.  <BR></i>
    <BR> <BR>As a designer nobody&#39;s ever heard of &#40;outside of the hallowed
    halls of typophile&#41; it seems I&#39;d need a relatively complete character
    set  &#40;uc, lc, numerals&#41; and a sample of the face in action. How much more?
    My current thinking is if you&#39;ve concieved additional weights, it might be
    enough to simply include Hamburgefontsiv in the additional weights &#40;along
    with that complete set in one weight&#41;. Wouldn&#39;t that be enough to let
    a reviewer know a&#41; the flavor or what you&#39;re doing and b&#41; you do/don&#39;t
    have the skills to complete additional weights/italics. <BR> <BR>I would love
    to hear other people talk nitty gritty like Sean, JFP, and I have done in the
    course of these threads. It is all well and good for us to guess at what is required.
    Rich Roat, you drop in on a discussion from time to time. What are you looking
    for? Jonathan? Others who&#39;ve had success? Less than success &#40;me&#41;?
    What did you do? <BR> <BR>After all didn&#39;t we get into designing type to get
    rich quick? Yeah, if my wife could hear me now. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Randy'
