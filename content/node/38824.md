body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some help in reversing some bitmap fonts (see
  attached image). I don't do any font editing myself which is why I'm looking for
  help :)\r\n\r\nIf anyone has bitmap font editing experience and can reverse some
  bitmap fonts for me for usage in Flash, please reply privately by clicking my user
  name and sending me an email through the contact tab. Please send your contact info
  including phone number and an estimate for your services or any questions you may
  have.\r\n\r\n1. I have the fonts on Mac & PC.\r\n2. Initially I'd like to do a test
  of reversing a font (Regular and Bold) for mac.\r\n3. If it works, I'd like to proceed
  with about 2-3 font families for both Mac & PC.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nmmdev23\r\n"

    so I don't really understand what you need. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you mean by
    reverse?\r\n\r\nAK"

    a new typeface to achieve this seems like a big effort for such a small thing...
    which i respect, but there must be an easier way."

  body: "I'm not sure if this is what you man by format but on a Mac, when we examine
    the existing font in the finder, for king it says \"Font Suitcase\". When I look
    at it in Fontbook on a Mac, the type is listed as TrueType.\r\n\r\nIn terms of
    off-the-shelf tools, we tried Bitfonter from Fontlab. It has a feature where you
    can select characters and invert them which is exactly what we want to do. Unfortunately,
    when we save out the font and try to use it, none of the characters work - they
    show up as a solid block of colors or just \".\"s.\r\n\r\nFrom speaking with Fontlab:\r\n1.
    They don't do any presales support\r\n2. Their forums are broken (we applied,
    were told we needed approval, but tech support says no approval is needed so forums
    must be broken)\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of off the shelf solutions or how to get
    Bitfonter to work, that'd be great too :)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMMDev"

  body: "TrueType fonts can include \"embedded bitmaps\" - but in general for Flash
    use, most fonts are \"outline\" fonts made to look like bitmap fonts - so Bitfonter
    is a dead-end here. Reversing outline fonts is possible in FontLab - but as noted
    no-one would normally bother as every app would let you define font and background
    colors and that's how you'd normally reverse things. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    see an obstacle of having hairline white breaks in the font when typed out as

  body: Why do you need the FONT reversed? The end result is something pretty much
    any desktop publishing/web browser will handle for you. No need to modify the
    font to achieve that.
