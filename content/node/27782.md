  kill a few minutes without actually having the time to open an application. But
  every now & then, there's just not enough \"movement\" to deal with my boredom,
  so I was just wondering if anyone here knows any similar forums for illstrations
  & graphic design as an alternative?\r\nI've already discovered some really nice
  links on this site, so any suggestions on cool fontsites are also welcome!"

    Logopond.com can be useful albeit you seem to get a lot of highschoolers in there.
    \r\n\r\nWhile not forums, these blogs usually have good discussions:\r\n\r\nSpeakUp\r\nDesignObserver\r\nTypographica.com\r\n\r\n"

    although it's retreated into it's shell of late.\r\n\r\nI always like going to
    <a href=\"http://www.drawn.ca\">drawn.ca</a> and\r\n<a  href=\"http://www.linesandcolors.com\">Lines
    and Colors</a> for some more in depth coverage of illustration."

  body: I've been in the Adobe.com forums for a long time. They have print and web
    design sections, and a typography section. Far less traffic than here, but worth
    a drop in every day.
