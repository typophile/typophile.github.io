  texts (10 and 8 pt Din medium and Din black) in a 10fold accordion brochure?\r\nI'm
  using a C50-Y20-M20-K100 (the same I used many times with good results) but I would
  appreciate your feedback."

  body: 'I would recommend 100%K alone so you don''t need to worry about registration.
    If you want a rich or warm black, I would use a Pantone spot colour (my swatch
    books are in storage so I cannot recommend an actual #).'

    to put white text on a black background I make two layers in indesign:\r\n1) 60/47/45/0
    with white letters with 0.35 pt white outline around them.\r\n2) 100% black overprinted
    with the same white letters without any outline."

  body: "Sorry, I forgot to mention my suggestion is for offset printing on coated
    paper. I usually use this method for book covers and if I need small texts on
    black in a catalog. \r\nWould be too dark for an offset paper like Munken."

  body: "Dear Kristians, small texts on black is exactly what I need (in a 10fold
    accordion brochure on 115gr coated paper)!\r\nUnfortunately, no Munken or any
    other Artic Paper available in many italian areas (the \"kingdom\" of Fedrigoni
    Group and of anonymous coated papers)."

  body: 'A trick I''ve used in four colour printing to cope with misregistration is
    mixing 100% of one ink with x% yellow. On a side note: Is there any point in ink
    traps for reversed text? Aren''t you trying to stop the ink from bleeding in the
    opposite direction.'

  body: "If you\u2019re knocking out small text from a 4-color black, then the exact
    composition of your rich black will not be the issue, registration will. Check
    with your Pre-press to see if they can spread the type in the CMY plate (I think
    some pre-press software provides this level of control)."

  body: "Kristians and kentlew are talking about trapping. It's a good idea if you
    aren't closely working with the printer. It gives you a rich black for color purposes,
    but a one-color black for the reversed type.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that if
    this is really small type, you're going to want to slightly beef up the type (via
    a thin stroke or consider going with a bold weight). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    if you are close to the printer in terms of being able to work directly with them,
    this may very well be something that they'd prefer to handle themselves. Traditionally,
    this was a pre-press/on-press issue that was handles by the professionals that
    handle the actual printing. In this era of really cheap printing, those craftsman
    aren't as abundant as they once were. \r\n\r\nMany skilled print shops may also
    have their own preferred rich black that they'd like you to use that takes into
    account all sorts of variables (the paper, their presses, their presspeople, etc.)"

    being consulted on technical issues.\r\n\r\n"
