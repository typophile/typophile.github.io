body: After looking around for books and reading the samples on Amazon, I came across
  a book -- Encyclopedia of Hell -- that used interesting fonts for the italics and
  names of the demons. They were too small for WhatTheFont to recognize, so I figured
  I'd try here. I apologize for the small and dull samples -- but that's all I had.
  Any ideas on what the fonts are?
