  body: " Jason: \u2018<em>The \"family name\" can't be more than 27 characters, and
    can't include hyphens.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nAlthough the problem on the Mac could
    well be caused by the naming of the font, I don\u2019t think the <em>Font Family</em>
    name has anything to do with this.\r\n\r\nAssuming that we\u2019re talking here
    about OpenType fonts, according to the specs there seems to be no limitation to
    the number of characters in the <em>Font Family</em> name, nor that the use of
    a hyphen is not allowed. The \u201827 characters\u2019 seem to refer to the specs
    of the PostScript Type1 format. As one can read in Adobe\u2019s <em>Font Naming
    Issues</em>, Technical Note #5088, 12 April 1993: \u2018<em>The FontName generally
    consists of a family name (speci\uFB01cally, the one used for FamilyName), followed
    by a hyphen and style attributes in the same order as in the FullName. For compatibility
    with the earliest versions of PostScript interpreters and with the \uFB01le systems
    in some operating systems, Adobe limits the number of characters in the FontName
    to 29 characters.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nMacintosh Font Menu Names were also restricted:
    \u2018<em>The standard names used in Macintosh font menus come from the name of
    the FOND resource associated with a Type 1 outline font. FOND resource names are
    limited to 31 characters, and may contain spaces. Because of a bug in a major
    software application which limits font menu names to 30 characters, Adobe recommends
    staying within this lower limit. In addition, System 7 for the Macintosh requires
    names to be unique for the \uFB01rst 28 characters.</em>\u2019 I have to check
    MS Of\uFB01ce 2011 for Mac on one of our test systems, but AFAIK MS Word for Mac
    always required a <em>Full font name</em> of maximum 30 characters. \r\n\r\nSo,
    probably you can easily solve this problem by using the <em>Compatible Full Name</em>
    (Name ID 18) for the Mac: \u2018<em>Compatible Full (Macintosh only); On the Macintosh,
    the menu name is constructed using the FOND resource. This usually matches the
    Full Name. If you want the name of the font to appear differently than the Full
    Name, you can insert the Compatible Full Name in ID 18.</em>\u2019 With 27 characters
    one is sure to stay on the safe side.\r\n\r\nI think what makes matters a bit
    more complex here is the <a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=313.0
    article\">Topic: Font Family Naming in FontLab Studio 5 </a> article, which mentions
    limitations which are obviously related to the way FontLab Studio handles font
    naming internally. Jason is referring to this, I reckon.\r\n\r\nFEB"

  body: "Last year there was a brief discussion on the OpenType list regarding the
    buggy way MS Word 2011 for Mac handles font names. After Adam stated \u2018<em>The
    way Word retrieves naming info is a mystery to me [\u2026]</em>\u2019, Read Roberts
    replied on Monday 16 July:\r\n\r\n\u2018<em>This is a known bug on Mac MS Word
    2011. It is not in previous versions. We saw the problems in Adobe fonts, and
    looked into it in Dec 2011. A font family will not appear In the hierarchical
    font menu for a given font file if there is no font file in the family for which
    the Cocoa API returns a base font.\_ In order to see the problem behavior, I needed
    to install several fonts from the same family: the API seems to have trouble in
    the fairly specific case of\_ multiple style groups in a set of fonts linked by
    having the same Mac name ID 16 (preferred name), and where some of the style groups
    do not have a Regular face.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
    saw this when we rebuilt the Adobe Type Library to build Mac menu names name ID1,2,16
    and 17) the same way as Windows name ID is built. (Incidentally, we made this
    change partly to be in accordance with the OT spec, and partly because the way
    we originally built the Mac menu names was due to a compromise to make OTF work
    in Mac OSX in 2000. Discussion with Apple engineers last year informed us that
    a) this is no longer necessary and b) parts of the Apple font handling logic no
    longer expect more than four faces with the same name ID 1).)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
    are not re-building our font library as we do expect that this bug will be fixed
    in some future release of MS Word for the Mac. </em>\r\n\r\nEspecially style-linking
    can cause problems and requires the usage of Name ID 16 and 17. Read gave a nice
    example on the OpenType list on 1 December 2010: \r\n\r\n\u2018<em>An additional
    note about building name ID 4: when Adobe builds name ID 4 for new fonts, we use
    the name id 16 and 17 when available, rather than only name ID 1 and 2.\_ This
    avoids name ID 4 conflicts within a large family, where name ID 1 + name ID 2
    for one face might be the same as name ID 1 for\r\nanother. Example:</em>\r\n\r\n<em>AGarmondPro-SemiBold:
    is the bold face of AGarmondPro-Regular\r\n\_ \_name ID 1 = \"Adobe Garamond\"\r\n\_
    \_name ID 2 = \"Bold\"\r\n\_ \_name ID 4 by OT spec v1.5 and earlier\_ = \"Adobe
    Garamond Bold\"</em>\r\n\r\n<em>AGarmondPro-Bold: is the regular style face within
    the style linked group\_ (\r\nAGarmondPro-Bold and \" AGarmondPro-BoldItalic\").\r\n\_
    \_name ID 1 = \"Adobe Garamond Bold\"\r\n\_ \_name ID 2 = \"Regular\"\r\n\_ \_name
    ID 4 by OT spec v1.5 and earlier\_ = \"Adobe Garamond Bold\"</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nAt
    DTL we have never used Name ID 16 and 17 for the Mac so far (despite Read\u2019s
    remark that \u2018<em>[\u2026] parts of the Apple font handling logic no longer
    expect more than four faces with the same name ID 1 [\u2026]</em>\u2019). We use
    any style name for the Font Subfamily name and we use Name ID 16 and 17 for Windows
    to duplicate this. By keeping the length of Name ID 18 at a maximum of 31 characters,
    our fonts seem to function well under MS Word 2011 for Mac (I just  gave this
    an extra check):\r\n\r\nTTName 0 1 0 0 \"Copyright (c) Dutch Type Library, 1994-2012.

    5</em> article some rules and restrictions are given for the lengths of names
    in FLS. As I mentioned earlier, some of these rules and restrictions seem to come
    forth from the way FLS handles naming internally. For instance, the less-than-30-characters
    restriction for the PostScript name differs from the \u2018</em>no longer than
    63 characters</em>\u2019 in the OT spec. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
    way to circumvent these restrictions is using for instance OTM for importing (and
    exporting, of course) the naming table (CFF-naming entries require manual editing
    though). This can also be useful when for instance fonts have to be renamed for
    use on the web. Small changes can be made in a text editor (in batch) then.\_\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"
