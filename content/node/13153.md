    a font predating Gotham which draws from similar sources, is a nice alternative.

  body: "Quoting <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/features.html\">H&FJ</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"Long
    before the emergence of a profession called \"graphic design,\" there was signage.
    Up until the mid-twentieth century, the job of providing architectural lettering
    often fell to engineers or draftsmen, most of whom worked outside of the typographic
    tradition. The shape of facade lettering was often determined by the practical
    business of legibility, rather than any sort of stylistic agenda \u2014 although
    inevitably, even the draftsman's vision of \"basic building lettering\" was influenced
    by the prevailing style of the time.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI believe this type
    of lettering was also the inspiration for Simonson's <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximasans.html\">Proxima
    Sans</a>, which is about to get the italic, condensed, OpenType <a href=\"http://marksimonson.com/article/118/proxima-sans-going-nova\">treatment</a>."

  body: "I sketched out the basic idea for Proxima Sans (particularly the lowercase)
    around 1981. (I called it Zanzibar at the time, just because I liked the word.
    The name Proxima Sans came later.) In 1991, I was art director of a magazine were
    I was using Gill Sans. I liked it, but wanted something a bit plainer and more
    geometric. Taking this basic concept and the earlier ideas I had explored with
    Zanzibar, I began working on what would ultimately become Proxima Sans (1994).
    \r\n\r\nMany existing faces influenced the look of Proxima Sans. I wanted something
    with the general proportions and stroke contrast of Helvetica or Akzidenz Grotesk,
    but with construction principles and details borrowed variously from Futura, Kabel,
    the American gothics (Copperplate Gothic, News Gothic, Franklin Gothic, etc.)
    and the U.S. Federal Highway signage typeface (the same one that inspired Font
    Bureau's Interstate). The result was a hybrid; a face combining humanist proportions
    with a somewhat geometric appearance.\r\n\r\nThe similarities between Proxima
    Sans and Gotham I attribute to zeitgeist. Avenir, which is even older, is also
    somewhat similar, except that its proportions are more like Futura. Given that
    Adrian Frutiger's aim was to redesign Futura, this is only natural."

  body: "I have a soft spot for Helvetica; it was one of the first fonts I admired
    when I started really looking at fonts as a teenager. I moved on and became more
    interested in other fonts. I still like it okay, but it's been over-used.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think there is a direct connection between Akzidenz Grotesk and Franklin
    Gothic. Franklin Gothic came out of the American \"gothic\" tradition--mainly
    wood types. Akzidenz Grotesk has German roots. They were roughly contemporaneous.
    Similar stuff was being done in England at the time. Bureau Grotesque is out of
    that tradition. No doubt there was some cross-pollenation, but it wasn't like
    it is today.\r\n\r\nAkzidenz means something like \"standard\" or \"commercial.\"
    (In fact, when Akzidenz Grotesk was imported to the U.S. in the 1950s, it was
    renamed \"Standard.\" That's the name I first knew it as.)"
