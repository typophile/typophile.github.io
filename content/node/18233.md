body: "Folks:\r\n\r\nBeing one of only two Mac users in two extended families, I sometimes
  get questions that strain what little knowledge I have about my machine. Here's
  one for which I don't even know where to begin to look for a meaningful answer:\r\n\r\n<em>Do
  you know if Apple still implements subpixel imaging in their font system?</em>\r\n\r\nMy
  first response was, \"Huh?\" My second was, \"I don't know, but I know a great bunch
  of people who do.\" Would anyone be so kind as to enlighten me: what is \"subpixel
  imaging in a font system,\" did Apple ever \"implement\" it, and are they doing
  so now? Thanks for your generosity in advance."

  body: "Each pixel on an LCD screen is made up of 1 red, 1 green and 1 blue element.
    Subpixel rendering involves controlling these elements independently to increase
    the effective resolution of the screen. Yes, recent versions of the Mac OSX (and
    Windows, and I think at least one Linux GUI) employ this technique to smooth text.
    \r\n\r\nThis Wikipedia article on sub-pixel rendering:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering\r\n\r\nAnd
    this part of the Apple typography article:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography#Subpixel_rendering\r\n\r\nShould
    cover all you need to know including illustrations!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
