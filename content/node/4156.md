body: "Okay, here it is. I&#39;ve been working on this project since Christmas. Maybe
  you&#39;ve seen my string hunting for these letter forms, but i finally found em
  all and did my best to digitize them. As with most designs that I respect, i&#39;ve
  started to work on international characters and a cyrillic set to match, but haven&#39;t
  gotten too far on those yet. I would set some text for you, but i haven&#39;t messed
  with the spacing much yet. I need some help in that regard anyway. if any of you
  want to point me toward some good sources... Any comments at all are appreciated,
  so lemme know what you think of these letter forms. I tried my hand at two \uFFFD
  glyphs, but don&#39;t know if either work. help please! also how do the thorns look?
  Anyone who&#39;s versed in Cyrillic, i&#39;d love to hear what you have to say on
  my small assortment of glyphs, especially the m&#39;agk&#39;ii znak. And what do
  you all think of that Euro symbol? does it work? Anyhow, hope to get something back
  on this one. Thnx in advance. <BR>P.S. Swash caps are in the works as well. <BR><!--attachment:

    Add a scroll to the top left like the N <BR>k: The upper arm is inconsistent.

  body: WOW! i got Randy Jones to gimme a crit. I was hopin you&#39;d take a look
    at this one and give me come feedback. I guess i was too excited to get this up
    and thus didn&#39;t bother with the back history &#40;or even finishing that lc
    x&#41; But here&#39;s <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/24232.html"
    target="_blank"> a little backhistory</a>. <BR>I started this project because
    i wanted to find a digital version and couldn&#39;t so i figgered i&#39;d have
    to make my own. As to rights, i tried to find that info out and all i came up
    with was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/atf/" target="_blank"> this</a>,
    and i&#39;m not sure if this info applies to this face. If so, this will definately
    just be a personal project for myself, or maybe i could give it away to interested
    parties? <BR>I tried to keep as true to the original as possible, &#40;you can
    check this against scans of the original in the backhistory&#41; but i&#39;m not
    opposed to making alternate glyphs. In fact i think i need an lc f without the
    flourish just for example. I&#39;m not particularly fond of the original A or
    Q either, so i may try to come up with something for those two as well. <BR>This
    face was first marketed by MacKellar in the 1890s? so I&#39;d guess that Hermann
    is long departed, or else i would have liked to speak with him about his great
    display faces! <BR>Thanks for the feedback again, Randy. And did any of the scrolls
    seem square to you? I&#39;m paranoid that i may have not gotten them quite right.
    &#40;They were a pain in the neck!&#41; Thanks again, and if you could, lemme
    know what you think after checking out the original.

    happens to be the first album by my favorite band, radiohead, who, by chance,
    also have a great bent for typography. I fell in love with BD Plakatbu because
    of them and when they used Mrs. Eaves for their latest jacket art and had the
    dignity to credit the design in their credits, my respect for them grew. 77 is
    my year, the year of the snake.

  body: Okay, I&#39;ve been working on cleaning up my outlines and I&#39;m getting
    close to being ready to go back and add some bracketing. From the beginning i&#39;ve
    been trying to make this kind of a Bodoni with flourishes kind of thing. I was
    reading up on Bodoni in Anatomy of a Typeface the other night and became aware
    that the original Bodonis did feature small &#40;almost imperceptible&#41;  brackets.
    Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any original samples of Bodoni&#39;s to refer to.
    Anyone have any suggestions on where i might be able to find &#40;perhaps on the
    web&#41; some specimens that would show this detail?

    is morticed &#40;thnx hrant&#41; and instead of bracketing the serifs on the lc,
    i incised them - i&#39;ll make a bracketed version after i figger out where i&#39;m
    going with this &#40;and have a chance to look at Bodoni <BR>2&#41; i tried fixing
    the lc color issues by making my bowls a bit trimmer. <BR>3&#41; Manufactured
    a few alternate characters - mostly just fiddling around slapping parts together.
    The only one I&#39;m really pleased with is the alt X. Goudy helped me think that
    one up. The alt k is alright, as is the alt U and alt Q, but that alt j is just
    nasty! i also tried manufacturing a double s &#40;esset?&#41; but i don&#39;t
    know if it&#39;s too jarring to the eye. i don&#39;t really know how it should
    look. i&#39;m still trying to come up with a few more alt characters - trying
    to imagine &#34;a more elegant g&#34; that would fit in this face and how to make
    the I less nekkid, the R less rigid and the A less garish <BR>4&#41; I don&#39;t
    know how well i did with spacing. I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s too loose or not.
    <BR>5&#41; I gave you a sample setting - i don&#39;t think this face would ever
    be used for more than a few lines at a time - if that. <BR>6&#41; I added diacritics
    - i think i did okay positioning all my sputniks, the ring seems too small tho.
    <BR>7&#41; Still working on the vwxyz, so don&#39;t fault me there, i&#39;m not
    finished with those yet. Otherwise chop it up! Lemme know where i&#39;m still

    <BR>The first big question I guess is: do you want the swash caps to stand out
    so much in weight, or do you want them to be equal to the small/normal caps? And
    if it&#39;s the latter, what size relationship do you assume &#40;if the swash
    is a totally separate font&#41;? What you might do is have a smallcaps font where
    the &#34;UC&#34; set is the swash and the &#34;lc&#34; set is the normal caps
    but vertically centered. But then you couldn&#39;t mix the actual lc very easily...
    In terms of the weight, ideally I guess you should have multiple weights for the
    swash - but that might be outside your &#34;time budget&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for
    form, I think most of your swash caps are solid, but some need a lot of help.
    Especially those long curls you have on some of them are seriously malformed.
    Like the &#34;N&#34; needs to be totally rethought, I&#39;d say. Some of them
    are great though, including tough ones like the &#34;G&#34;, &#34;U&#34; and &#34;X&#34;.

  body: Paul, <BR>Many of your &#34;Swash Caps&#34; actually look like Initial caps
    which might be used by a book designer to start a chapter.  They are bolder than
    the typical text &#40;perhaps this is what Hrant is getting at&#41;. Much of the
    weight is in the number of line segments, not just the weight.  As Hrant indicated
    above, this would work better with CAPS and Small Caps. <BR>To me, flourishes
    are meant to entwine. See pointed-pen italic caligraphy or engravers scripts like
    Bickham. This of course makes for slower reading but it is not a problem with
    small amounts of text as in invitations or citations where the reader is at leasure
    to re-read and enjoy the hopefully well-crafted typography. <BR>I feel your Swash
    initials could be used nicely as initial drop-caps with a more traditional roman
    text face.  This treatment might be fun for an older children&#39;s adventure
    series kind of book. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    money, or i&#39;d be sorely disappointed with this one! &#40;as evidenced by the
    interest or lack thereof in this thread&#41; <BR> <BR>okay so to answer a few
    questions: <BR>weight difference - from <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/24232.html"
    target="_blank"> the samples i&#39;m working from</a>, i think that the swash
    caps, the caps and the lower case are all set in different sizes. Since this is
    a display face, hopefully the weight difference won&#39;t be too disturbing at
    display sizes. I&#39;ll admit, the difference looks really stark in the digital
    sample... i still need to print it out to see if it looks that way on paper. <BR>Right
    now i have all these in one font with the swash caps available through the OT
    swash function &amp; the smcp function gives you the swash&#43;normal caps  combo.
    I think that I will do a couple other versions, balancing the weights better and
    separating the sets up into different fonts. <BR> <BR>So you don&#39;t like the
    N.swsh? is it really malformed? or you just don&#39;t like the letterform? as
    iterated before, i&#39;m trying to stick as close to the original as possible
    &#40;see link above&#41;, but i&#39;m totaly open to doing alternate characters
    &#40;the cap X in the first line of this first sample is one of my alternates&#41;.
    What other characters need alternates besides the N.swsh? <BR> <BR>Thnx for your
    help and comments, guys. I really do appreciate all your feedback. <BR> <BR>p.s.
    okay i printed it out and that N.swsh IS pretty fugly i&#39;ll fix it. But did
    you mean there should be an alternate character, Hrant? or just that i need to
    pay better attention? Also, the swash caps ARE a lot heavier, I think i&#39;ll
    lighten em up for any versions that combine all 3 sets or where they&#39;re paired
    with the lc. whaddya think of that?'

    that&#39;s one good reason to create alternates. <BR> <BR>If you make a weight
    axis, you can choose your exact weights whenever it feels comfortable to. <BR>

    offensive had you not. So alternates for M, N and U? any others? <BR> <BR>So a
    weight axis will benefit only PS T1 users, am I right? I haven&#39;t toyed too
    much making multiple masters, but i could always give it a whirl. This &#34;little
