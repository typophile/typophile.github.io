  body: It's actually the swash caps I'm trying to ID. I didn't know Palatino had
    a swash style available... or is that from another typeface? Appreciate the help.

  body: 'According to <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~fez/palatino/palfaq1.0.txt">this
    Palatino FAQ</a>: "The original swash italic capitals designed for the foundry
    Palatino are not available digitally. Linotype''s GX version comes with a set
    of swash capitals, but they''re actually Ariadne Initials..." The FAQ is pretty
    old, but it still appears to be true. That W doesn''t come from Ariadne.'
