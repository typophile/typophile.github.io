  i am in the middle of writing an essay about the style in the 80s, including everything
  from fashion to magazine design.\r\nI am having a bit of trouble though finding
  any info on what types of fonts where used back in the 80s, for magazines, ads and
  the likes.\r\n\r\nIf someone could direct me towards some sites with info, or perhaps
  share some examples on fonts and how they where used, that would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :)"

    the beginning of the decade, phototypesetting was supplanting hot and cold metal
    composition; and, by the end of the decade, desktop publishing was on its way
    to making dedicated typesetting equipment and its operators quaint curios of the
    past.\r\n\r\nAs I remember it, the ITC effect\u2014classic typefaces re-imagined
    with larger x-heights\u2014was a strong current, as was a lot of homogenized design
    occasioned by the limited range of typefaces available on Macs."

    Friz Quadrata. Eras. Bookman with swashes. No end of \"futuristic\" and \"computery\"
    display lettering constructed with a compass and straight-edge. The chrome effect,
    first by airbrush and then with the infancy of 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nI assume public
    libraries still have periodical archives. Go to one and pick out a bunch of magazines
    from the '80s to see for yourself what they looked like."

    in the 1980s was Fallon McElliggott Rice, Nancy Rice being the art director.\r\n\r\nEvery
    year back then, Communication Arts advertising awards annual was \uFB01lled with
    their print ads (it was a swan song era for type-house-set print advertising)
    with massive, tightly set headlines like the ones shown here: http://www.adcglobal.org/archive/hof/2006/?id=301\r\n\r\nYou
    see, it wasn't just about the fonts, but about the way they were set, by people
    who spent all day just nuancing headline settings."

  body: Ah, yes, the tight settings. That influenced me so much that it still seems
    normal, and any unkerned space just seems glaringly vast to me. I hadn't thought
    about it before, but I suppose that the trend was commanded by the fresh novelty
    of phototypesetting's ability to overlap type to that degree.

    will have archived magazines that old on microfilm, which is still useful but
    it's not quite the same as browsing through a stack of physical magazines."
