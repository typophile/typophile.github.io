  body: "feels like many of these characters are Vivaldi. But I can't say which version,
    or if there is one with alternates that would fit where the standards don't match,
    or if a secondary font/modifications are going on. perhaps someone more learned
    can elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\nedit -- the \"z\" actually looks to me like it's been
    turned upside-down and then had a tail added. The \"P\" seems like an \"R\" cut
    up... not sure about the \"T\"."
