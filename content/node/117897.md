  body: Thank you for looking, I appreciate it.  The best I could come up with is
    SciFly-Sans, found on dafont.com.  It'll have to do for now.

  body: "Not a bad substitute. \r\n\r\nIf you are just looking for a vector version
    of the logo, go to Petplan's website and search for \".pdf\". Find one that contains
    the logo--if it was placed as a vector, you can open the PDF in Illustrator and
    extract it."
