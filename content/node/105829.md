  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWell this sort of stuff is always going to be tricky, because
    quite possibly it will have been done as a one off hand lettered job and not be
    based on any particular font as such. Although, when I first saw the logo it had
    a familiarity about it, so just for the hell of it I dropped a key line of a \"brush
    style' font over it and, well, it looks to me that it may well have started out
    being based on the font \"Bira\" by M\xE5ns Greb\xE4ck as the e, o, n are almost
    identical on the overlay. Then it would have been further modified for the swash
    on the g etc. You get the general idea!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, as you seem interested
    in this type of \"hand lettered/brush\" style of font with extra ligatures and
    glyphs, check out others by M\xE5ns Greb\xE4ck:\r\nhttp://www.aringtypeface.com/\r\nand
    especially the classy fonts available from\r\nhttp://sudtipos.com/fonts/90\r\nWay
    cool stuff - \r\nAlso, for the real sign writers:\r\nhttp://artandsignstudio.com/fontmenu.html\r\nPlus,
    as ever - the always fantastic:\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bira-Personal_5285.gif]"

    to be almost matching original Pigeon logo, too close to lie for me.
