  body: Just musing, but isn't it interesting that Harvard uses Bembo and Yale uses
    Carter's <a href=http://www.yale.edu/universityprinter/typeface/history.html>interpretation</a>
    of the original Bembo text? What is it about that style that's so alluring for
    them? I can think of a few reasons myself. From its <a href=http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/>website</a>,
    Princeton has forged a different path with what seem to be Baskerville and Helvetica.

    something like Univers?"
