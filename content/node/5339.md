body: Hi all. <BR> <BR>Not sure if this is the right forum...but <BR>I am looking
  for a font that says &#39;1970&#39;s Beach Culture&#39;, or if Beach Culture is
  too specific then just 1970&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Can anyone suggest a font that encapsulates
  the spirit of that time &#40;and place&#41;? <BR> <BR>Many thanks. <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Or you might take a common face from the era, and add &#34;flair,&#34;
    as Phil Martin used to back in the day. Scroll down a little to check out this

    target="_blank">thread</a>. It has some good suggestions. If you&#39;re lazy to
    read that, a good recommendation would be to check out <a href="http://www.fontalicious.com/super/fonts.html"
    target="_blank">Fontalicious</a> which has some great retro-looking fonts. As
    for being typographically and historically accurate, perhaps someone like Mark
    S. can help you. Be careful how far you delve into accurate 70s type though, the
    results can be <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24826.html?1075527026"
    target="_blank">frightening</a> to say the least &#40;think flare&#41;.

  body: Don&#39;t really have much to add, except do some research. For instance,
    try to find surf magazines, posters, advertising, etc. from the seventies. Personally,
    I only have a very vague idea about what the 1970s Beach Culture look was. Although,
    I did find <a href="http://surfcrazy.com/" target="_blank">this</a>. Narly.
