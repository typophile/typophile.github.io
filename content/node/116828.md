  I am using a vector graphics program with some custom letters that I created for
  titling on publications for a company. I have the whole alphabet, uppercase and
  lowercase, all on the same SVG file. I don't have a lot of experience with creating
  font files and I was wondering if there was any way or software to create a font
  from these letters at it would be easier than having to copy and paste the letters
  to manually create the words?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "If you've got Indesign, you could try IndyFont, which is a script for indesign,
    with which you can quite easily create working OT fonts. (really!) It has some
    limitations, for instance no kerning, but it could serve your purpose, as it is
    quite inexpensive, and easy to work with. You can find it here: http://www.indiscripts.com/category/projects/IndyFont\r\n\r\nAnother
    alternative is Glyphs Mini, which can be bought from the AppStore for 40\u20AC.
    It is quite friendly to work with for beginners, has some automated OT features,
    class kerning.  \r\n\r\nI have both (I am not a pro type designer, but I do create
    fonts form time to time for personal projects) and both of these might work for
    you as well."

  body: All of the font producing software can use SVG files as source material. FontLab,
    Fontographer etc. On a basic level it would be cut and paste each glyph into the
    font program and refine from that and then generate the font. Least costly program
    is TypeTool from FontLab, but remember all of these programs do take a bit of
    time to learn.

  body: "I can't really recommend IndyFont. It is like using an InDesign plug-in to
    cook dinner for you: the fact that it works is genuinely amazing, but it is simply
    the wrong tool for the job. A bizarre hack that makes one wonder why....\r\n\r\nGlyphs
    Mini and our own TypeTool are fine starter choices. If you don't care about your
    operating system\u2019s UI conventions, and/or are on a tight budget, and/or love
    libre software, there is also FontForge.\r\n"

    an already good group. Type guys are good guys.

  body: "I see you point Thomas, Indyfont is no real replacement for a font editor,
    but it does provide some easy to use tools for non-professional typedesigners.
    The functionality is limited, but it does work.\r\n\r\nI was quite dissapointed
    by TypeTool, especially when compared to glyphs mini. The interface was rather
    dodgy to use, even if I had some experience with fontlab. It feels outdated. Will
    there be an updated version any time soon?"

    it is not going to be out right away. It will however be on an entirely new code
    base with a completely overhauled interface, and will not feel like a refugee
    from a different decade."

    to Merriam-Webster\r\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soon\r\n\r\n&
    now Thomas, I said \"closer,\" not \"the same as.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
