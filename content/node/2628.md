    <BR>tibor kalman <BR> <BR>John, the concept is good and the context/readability/legibility
    question is worthy of a book. &#40;book deal: Hrant, you should write a book on
    some of this stuff.&#41; I call this process of creating letterforms the Lineto/fusion
    method. Everybody I&#39;m sure has seen the great stuff at lineto.com. I think
    every gridchild has messed around with Digital variations. Miles Newlyn has a
    pretty good one. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re posting this for criticism...so some of the
    letters -- b, k, m, v, x -- well they seem too dark. But unless you stray from
    the beginning forms, what can you do? <BR> <BR>the &#39;b&#39; could be light
    like the &#39;d&#39;  <BR> <BR>the k and the x, wow, those are difficult using
    the forms. <BR> <BR>I understand your context point, but maybe there&#39;s another
    solution to some of those darker letters to make it the forms more legible. <BR>

    major problems if it&#39;s indeed intended to be LCD  <BR>or backlit. <BR> <BR>Or
    are you designing a display face for print use <BR>that merely looks like a backlit
    face? In which case you  <BR>have a lot more freedom. '

    but was having a hard time with the space between what I thought was &#34;SO ME&#34;
    &#34;Some design is merely a language&#34; so I ignored the dot &#40;which I thought
    could have been decorative&#41; and stated the obvious form &#34;L&#34; <BR> <BR>of
    course I knew I was wrong. <BR> <BR>For me the problem is mixing up lower case
    letterforms with uppercase letterforms in crazy display format. '

  body: ' Good job John. I find this font very fun. I am not sure what it would be
    used for, but it is a clever twist on an older design. I think perhaps even Miles
    Newlyn experimented with this type of design a few years ago, it was however not
    so bubbly. '
