  portugeuse and French translation business. Below is a quick paragraph from the
  company&#39;s pr... <BR> <BR>1Voice Translation Services offers a wide variety of
  translation and linguistic services to the global community. Many enterprises are
  now realizing the value of communicating effectively with a target audience, and
  1Voice&#39;s expertise lies in applying the proper cultural, technical, industry-specific
  and dialectal dynamics in all its services in order to achieve the highest market
  impact. <BR> <BR>I am new to design and have been having a bit of a creative block
  with conceptual ideas and marks for this company. <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR><img

  body: Onevoice is a good name for translation services, but you need to decide whether
    the company name is &#34;Onevoice&#34;, &#34;OneVoice&#34;, &#34;1Voice&#34; or
    others

  body: Could you somehow imply a sound wave with the &#34;V&#34; &#40;without being
    too crude&#41;? <BR>You might use a merged &#34;1V&#34; with the beak of the &#34;1&#34;
    to that effect. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
