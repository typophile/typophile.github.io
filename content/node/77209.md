  body: You're probably better off choosing a typeface that suits the name of the
    company, rather than trying to choose one which appeals to "the latin community."
    Many years ago, I did some A/V presentation work for the distributors of Carta
    Blanca beer, and they developed different ads for the Cuban, Mexican and Puerto
    Rican communities in the U.S., so there really is no monolithic "latin community"
    as such.

    ask, did Carta Blanca actually change their branding for each of those communities
    or just the vibe of each campaign?\r\n"

    different visuals, and the narrators spoke in different accents. FWIW, their market
    research also discovered that American beer drinkers think imported beer comes
    in green bottles. Carta Blanca switched from brown glass to green, and its sales
    increased 30%."

  body: I would say, choose a typeface that you like, from the many with names that
    end in "a", and then bullshit the rest of the rationale.
