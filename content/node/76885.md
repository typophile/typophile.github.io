body: I guess I actually know what the font itself is (Eastern character set bundled
  with Mac OS) but I actually rather like the western characters included in the set.
  Would they be original designs for the typeface itself, or is it more likely they're
  repurposed from a face I'd be more familiar with? Any ideas?
