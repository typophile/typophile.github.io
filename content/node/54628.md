    Pangea design did for a swedish newspaper. The black weight of this typeface is
    especially similar to your sample.\r\nNot so much here, but still a small overview:\r\nhttp://pangeadesign.se/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23%3Adagens-nyheter&catid=2%3Akunduppdrag&Itemid=14&lang=en\r\n"

  body: "hmm I don't see too much of a resemblance there. Helvetica would be closer.
    Guess it's one these old fonts that got lost in the digital aera.\r\n\r\nThanks
    anyway."
