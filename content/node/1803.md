  that the footnotes were set in <a href="http://www.monotype.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=202891">Myriad
  Tilt</a>, at about 6pt. <BR> <BR>Although the stems in all the letters are highly
  tapered so that the letters appear a little skewy, when reading from a normal distance
  this was not very visible in the footnote text. More the opposite, in fact: the
  footnotes stood out for their clarity and ease of reading, even when compared to
  the larger body text &#40;IIRC it was Berkeley Old Style&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I suppose
  that the stem tapering in MT was done so that it emphasised the most distinctive
  and visually obvious parts of the letters. Has anyone experimented with deforming
  a font for very small sizes to improve readability &#40;not counting hinting--I&#39;m
  talking paper here&#41;? <BR>'
