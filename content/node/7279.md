  body: I think Too Much is an old Image Club font. Grant Hutchinson <BR>should chime
    in with more info. As far as I know it&#39;s unavailable <BR>anywhere as Agfa
    Monotype now owns Eyewire and I don&#39;t find <BR>it at fonts.com.

    <BR> <BR>&#40;Unfortunately the Typophile search isn&#39;t catching the old stuff,  <BR>so
    I had to go through Google to find this gem.&#41;

    posted above&#41; is also a freeware version. How bizarre-o.

  body: 'Since the above-linked prior Typophile thread about Too Much, I came across
    a copy of the only version I&#39;m aware of of Too Much &#40;solid&#41; and Too
    Much Outline. This is from WSI, a firm that sells lots of mostly knock-off-clone
    fonts to software companies which, in turn, bundle them with their applications.
    <BR> <BR>The fonts were named Chubby by WSI and, since this is apparently not
    available from anyone else, I&#39;m linking to the solid <a href="http://fonts.ontheweb.com/fonts/chubby__1.html"

  body: The old Image Club collection Grant mentioned had the Solid, Outline, and
    Shadow versions of Too Much, but as stated you&#39;d have to find one of the old
    Letterpress CD&#39;s for sale &#40;I have Letterpress 5.0 and 6.0, which both
    have it&#41;.  The typeface was originally from Visual Graphics Corp.  <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW,
    I&#39;m back from vacation, but still swamped with e-mails and an order backlog,
    so I may show up only sporadically for a while.&#41;

    to getting back into it.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Southern Italy was a fun tour, and we
    had a great time, but I had to resist saying the names of typefaces I saw on signs
    and posters. They used Belwe, Revue, B

  body: Oh yeah, and the cities, museums, churches and ruins were great. The people
    were generally very friendly, the countryside was beautiful, and the pizza was
    terrific.
