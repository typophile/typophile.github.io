body: "Although I'm a designer, I figure that you guys here may have more experience
  with type and I'd like to ask for your opinion and advice for choosing a font for
  a project.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, here I go: I need a nice typeface for a <strong>identity</strong>
  for a Church of England parish in London, which also includes separate community
  projects etc. \r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts so far:\r\n\r\n* type
  should have a modern feel\r\n* needs to work in all sorts of contexts: from births,
  over parties, to funerals\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe typeface should lend itself to work
  well in all sorts of applications, for example:\r\n\r\n* stationary, brochures and
  leaflets\r\n* signage\r\n* type-based posters that make an impact\r\n* projector
  display, e.g song lyric displays and presentations\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nOther requirements/restrictions:\r\n\r\n*
  We're on a budget! So low price is a key. The font would be used on about 4 machines.\r\n*
  Should possibly be OpenType (use on Mac and PC)\r\n* The name of the organisation
  is \r\n<strong>Parish of St Mary Magdalene and St David's Churches</strong>. \r\nI
  am concerned of the two 'M's and a lower case 'g' to look pleasant. I wonder whether
  it might be nice to have the 'g' as 2 storey.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that a <strong>sans
  serif</strong> typeface would be the way to go, as I definitely want to get away
  from the traditional feel of church. At the same time there should be a certain
  feeling of respect -- so nothing weird.\r\n\r\n.\r\nI have done some searching and
  have come up with a list that I feel is possible in terms of budget and style. \r\n\r\nCould
  you please advice and <strong>put some reason with your recommendation</strong>?
  That would be really nice. Suggestions for anything amazingly fitting that I've
  overlooked are welcome -- otherwise please work from the list.\r\n\r\nAs a general
  question: How strongly do you feel about using a serif typeface alongside the main
  type, e.g. for headings...?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n******************\r\n<a href=\"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html\">Delicious</a>\r\n******************\r\n<em>Family

  I feel that this has a more churchy character than the previous two, but then again

    Beorcana just seems too traditional, churchy. The church should look fresh and
    relevant to people -- especially those outside the church. Also, it needs to be
    used in many different contexts, and I think that Beorcana goes a bit too far
    into just one direction. \r\n\r\n===\r\nEDIT\r\nwell, having just seen <strong><A
    href=\"http://www.linussebastian.com/northside/index.html\">this</a></strong>
    makes me wonder. I guess it would be good to have a headline/quote font combined
    with a more  'straight' one for general text."

  body: "I struggle a bit with the idea of only using a sans throughout too - bit
    old fashioned I suppose.\r\n\r\nHaving said that I haven't seen Jos Buivenga's
    fonts before and I am rather impressed. I've just had a quick play and they seem
    work well together too. They are quite tonally compatible. They lend themselves
    to quite open spacing, so I don't see why they shouldn't be able to comply with
    the situations you mentioned and get a modern and approachable look. It may take
    a bit of extra effort to get the spacing/feed/layout combinations working just
    so, but that's where the time goes. Serif heading, sans text, vice versa, nice
    coolour palette - could look the business.\r\n\r\nJust a thought, but if you wanted
    a character or two modified for this client, he looks like the kind of chap who
    might oblige.\r\n\r\nSave the dosh for the organ fund, or something nice for the
    christmas party.\r\n\r\nAnd remember everybody - e for envelopes (stationery).\r\n"

    your use. \r\n\r\nYou also noted that you would need to license for 4 computers;
    a single license of Apex New allows for use on up to 4 computers of mixed platforms,
    since the fonts ship as OpenType. (Maybe we should clarify this on our site...)\r\n\r\nWe
    have received very good feedback from users of the fonts, and they have been specified

    warm contemporary sans serif with a stylized handwritten touch expecially in its
    set of alternates (which may or may not be impractical in daily use, depending

    Rather not. (Plus I just don't like open G's like these.)\r\n\r\n<strong>Credo</strong>\r\nMaybe
    not the right guy for the job with that fancy comma, i-dot and k. Lacks some elegance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aaux</strong>\r\nUh.

      on this. Would be great!</strong> \r\nIt seems we are not quite there yet.\r\n\r\n**************\r\n\r\n1.
      We did not think much of faces that appeared to be chosen especially thinking
      of 'church' - e.g. stuff with traditional connotations.\r\n\r\n2. We wanted
      some face that has something rasonably special about it, e.g. noting like Depot

      </a>and <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locatordisplay/index.html\">Locator
      Display</a> possibly in conjunction with a serif face</strong>. \r\nHowever,
      I've just now discovered that <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/purchase.html\">the
      low price on the site </a> is for a 1-computer license only, and it seems to
      get too expensive for more.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do? Locator seems just nice with
      this extra Display version. Also it would work well on Projector display during
      church services - nice and clear.\r\nThe only worry I had with Locator is whether
      the low cap height would make it actually more difficult to read, esp on a projection
      screen, and it seems fairly wide, forcing smaller point sizes to fit content.\r\n\r\n<strong>So,
      are there any other suggestions as an alternative to Locator?</strong>\r\n\r\n**************\r\n\r\nAnother
      typeface I liked is <strong><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1381.html\">PMN
      Caecilia</a></strong>. (I think,I like it better than Absara Serif, poms). \r\nWhat
      are you views? \r\nI'm a bit worried to display anything serif on a projector
      where people have to head and speak/sing out words on the spot (good readability
      is essential). \r\nBut maybe this coud serve as a headline typeface?\r\n\r\nOr
      would I choose <strong><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1381.html\">Chaparral</a></strong>
      instead?\r\n\r\n\r\n**************\r\n\r\nThanks for your replies.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    opinions here (on Typophile):\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/cronos.html\r\n\r\nToday
    Sans has a plethora of weight variations for a number of applications, and it
    has a very warm and open feel. \r\n\r\n..................................................\r\n\r\nMy

    of Reading in 2003, there's a nice detailed account of how the Common Worship:
    Services and Prayers for the Church of England was redesigned. The designers tried
    several typefaces before settling on Adobe Monotype Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nThe book
    actually looks quite handsome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cover_5732.jpg]\r\n"

    before , and even in my test prints this time I just found it looking too round.
    It always gives me the impression that there is something went wrong in the printing
    process and the ink didn't print nicely."
