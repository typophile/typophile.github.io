  body: "Can't find a perfect match (type+roughened effect) but as it has been designed
    [[https://dribbble.com/shots/93890-The-Bison|Mads 'Mabu' Burcharth]], I'm afraid
    it'd be custom or at least, enough customized not to be identifiable.\r\nSome
    ready-to-go alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kcfonts/pewter|Pewter]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/borutta/wood-type-collection-2|Mader Regular]]
    (probably my favourite), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/borutta/wood-type-collection|Nuinia]]
    (works fine as well), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/thunderhouse|Thunderhouse]]\r\nMy
    idea would probably to consider a headline compressed gothic and post-roughened
    it: OL [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-headline-gothic|Headline Gothic]],
    K-Type [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/poster-sans|Poster Sans]] Extreme,
    [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/champion-gothic/overview|Champion Gothic]] Batamweight/[[http://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview|Knockout]]
    No.46 Flyweight"

  body: Or maybe Steelfish from Typodermic Stretched. Compacta could be altered easily
    to do this also.

  body: "I assume you can roughen the font so I will offer fonts that where the contour
    of the diagonal on _S_ is a close match to BISON and the width to height ratio
    is very close. I see very few real candidates:\r\nThe closest is OL Headline Gothic
    Triple Cond by Dennis Ortiz-Lopez [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OLHeadlineGothicTripleCondAsBison_4044.gif]\r\nFor
    an almost exact match thicken by using a parallel line stroke.\r\nThe also rans
    are Rama Gothic Cond Bold by Ryoichi Tsunekawa\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RamaGothicCondBoldAsBISON_5683.gif]\r\nand
    his Rama Gothic Cond Heavy [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RamaGothicCondHeavyAsBISON_5482.gif]\r\nFor
    a good match blend Rama Gothic Cond Bold and Cond Heavy to make an intermediate
    weight and compress the width to perhaps 80%\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-headline-gothic/
    and\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic/\r\nDon"

  body: "Here is the result of the blending and compression exercise for Rama Gothic
    Cond Bold and Cond Heavy \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RamaGothicCondBlendBoldHeavyWidth80PctAsBISON_4616.jpg]\r\nSlightly
    closer to BISON than OL Headline Gothic Triple Cond \r\nAnd here is the result
    of a simple 80 percent compression of Rama Gothic Cond Heavy [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RamaGothicCondHeavyWidth80PctAsBISON_5953.jpg]
    Pretty much the right weight but the counters are a little too closed.\r\nTinkering
    with permutations could produce a match where the differences a not noticeable.\r\nDon"
