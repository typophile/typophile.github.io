    filter added. Do you have the original scan? Cyan on White is not very readable.
    I tried to darken it but all I got was this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a0f34bb582677c65d721a91eb780862e_5047.41453.jpeg]\r\n\r\n\"NUMBER
    1\" is Artistamp from <a href=\"http://www.haroldsfonts.com/rubberstamp.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Harold's Fonts</a>\r\n\r\n2011 looks like it's a grunge version
    of an existing font (the '1's have the same distress).\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I think you might use \"Rubber Stamp\" for 2011. I think a Photoshop (or
    similar) noise technique was used, and perhaps the 0 was inverted, but the basic
    letterforms are very close.\r\n\r\nThe Script in the middle is completely unreadable
    to me, and you might as well pick any formal connected script as worry about trying
    to match something so unrecognizable, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
