body: "Greetings, everyone.\r\n\r\nI have been lurking around Typophile for quite
  some time. \r\n\r\nA number of you seem enlightened when it comes to typography,
  not just font design. I've read some interesting (often quite heated) discussions.\r\n\r\nMy
  question has to do with paragraphs that occur in essays and reports on an 8.5x11
  page. My right and left margins are 1.55 inches, top and bottom are an inch. Font
  is 11 pt. Palatino (Adobe's Palatino LTstd.) Leading is fixed at 16 points. Indent
  is 18 points (should be 16, but I prefer a little more emphasis.) Line length is
  12-13 words (less than 6 inches.) Text is ranged left, ragged right (I find justified
  text abhorrent.) Gentle hyphenation where necessary. There's nothing like a soft,
  soothing rag!\r\n\r\nSo, would it be better to indent paragraphs, or simply leave
  a white space between paragraphs, calculated at half the leading (8 points or so)?
  I've always gone for the \"block paragraph\" look, but recently I've gotten the
  impression that it is poor form. I'm willing to change in the name of correct typography.\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate any advice. \r\n\r\n\r\n  "

  body: "According to Bringhurst, Elements of Typographic Style, the ideal line length
    (measure) is 66 lower case characters--2 1/2 lower case alphabets. The big problem
    with letter sized paper is that usually the measure is too long, as it sounds
    like it is in your case. A line over 75 or 80 characters is not good for continuous
    reading, even with additional leading, as you have done. \r\n\r\nI think this
    is an extremely important feature of readable typography. Check on this and fix
    it if need be. "

    Does the characters per line measure include blank spaces (spaces between words)?
    \r\n\r\nWhat about indenting vs. leading to indicate a new paragraph?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is no rule on indenting vs space between paragraphs. One way of dealing
    with the excessive measure is to have a wide left margin and put subheads in it.
    Another is to have two columns. Whatever you do will affect your decision on indents.
    \r\n\r\nThe most important first question is who is the audience, and what do
    you want to accomplish. If this is school reports, then the main thing will be
    to relate to teacher's expectations or requirments. If it is published, it depends
    on the material and the readership. The goal of the work takes the lead in determining
    typography.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't read Bringhurst, do get a copy. It will give
    you an immense amount of useful information. "

  body: "It's a formal historical essay. Formatting requirements are fairly flexible,
    so I'm free to experiment, within reason.\r\n\r\nMargins, left and right, are
    now 1.75 inches, so lines are now 5 inches wide or so. There is an improvement
    in readability, certainly, but the way the text sits looks a bit odd with those
    generous margins. Perhaps the body text looks to long now because top and bottom
    margins are still one inch.\r\n\r\nStill, it reads faster. The rag makes it warmer
    and more inviting, too.\r\n\r\nThank you kindly for your help so far.\r\nI just
    placed an order for Bringhurst's book at my local bookstore. I look forward to
    reading it. Typophiles are raving about it. \r\n  "

    a wider font.\r\n\r\nIf your measure is long you need to increase your leading
    to assist the reader in locating the beginning of the next line.\r\n\r\nFor continuous
    formal text in a traditional vein, I think paragraph indents are better. Block
    paragraphs slow down the flow a bit because each one is more of a new beginning."

    analysis of the parts of a text or where you need a clear segmentation o where

    so many more beautiful options at our disposal to signify paragraph breaks.

  body: ">were only really necessary on manual typewriters.\r\n\r\nNo. Indented paragraphs
    are very old, long before the typewriter. They are an excellent way to mark paragraphs,
    and in my opinion you should only depart from this standard when you have a good
    reason to. The standard indents are, according to Bringhurst, one en, one em and
    one 'lead' meaning that if the text is 10/12 the indent is 12 points. \r\n\r\nBringhurst
    notes that spaces between paragraphs are standard in business letters, and can
    be OK in short business materials because they suggest \"precision crispness and
    speed. ...In longer sequences, they may seem soulless and uninviting.\" \r\n "

  body: "Yes, I've seen that indent rule: indent matches the leading.\r\n\r\nJan Tschichold,
    Bringhurst, and I think even Eric Gill are all in favour of it.\r\n\r\nIt's intersting
    that an indent of that length doesn't really stand out on the page. Sure, you
    know it's there, but it doesn't draw the eye to it. In fact, if the last line
    of the paragraph runs to nearly the full measure, you might miss the indent at
    first glance, until of course your eyes get there during the course of reading.
    It's a very unobtrusive way to signal a new paragraph.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some people
    simply prefer the clarity and crispness of block paragraphs. Eah paragraph is
    a separate, logical unit. I find that block paragraphs that are separated by half
    the leading and no more are more pleasing.\r\n\r\nStill, I'm beginning to feel
    that indenting is a warmer and more inviting method. This time, the margins and
    comfortable leading provide the breathing room, and not the white space between
    paragraphs. Although one usually ends up with some white space anyway,  since
    the last line of a paragraph doesn't usually run the full measure."

    you're glossing over the fact their genesis was in fact a \"mistake\"! They were
    empty spaces reserved for rubrication/illuimination, but often left unused (sometimes
    because of deadlines, sometimes because of different[ly priced] editions). That
    said, I do agree they're less bad than flush paragraphs; you'd have to have a
    particularly nasty strain of the Modernism virus to prefer <cite>that</cite>.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"More
    beautiful option\"? Well, yes, although nothing to do with digital: the portly
    but practical Pilcrow! And what's really nice about it is that you can use it
    right in the middle of a \"physical\" paragraph block to mark a separate \"conceptual\"
    paragraph (like on my site), often saving space and gaining elegance.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I would suggest that an em is too narrow an indent for your measure. I understand
    your abhorrence of justified text but an indented first line which falls short
    could look weak or centred, I believe that in order for your text to be a familiar
    experience* to the audience you might need to look at justified. Pilcrows in flowing
    text are an alternative but probably too great a distraction to an audience outside
    the typographic realm.\r\n* after all most books are justified.\r\nTim"
