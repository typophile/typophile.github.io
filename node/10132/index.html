  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK, this is an odd one: I&#39;m currently designing proposals for an engineering firm. We respond to RFPs &#40;Request for Proposals&#41;, that often specify &#34;No font smaller than 12 pt.&#34; Since we have a lot to say, I&#39;ve been forced to choose typefaces on the basis of character size. <BR> <BR>&#40;I hear your sighs ... but it&#39;s a paying gig, and those are kinda hard to find in this place and time.&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, Perpetua is my current favorite for serif font; it&#39;s so tiny that we have to ad &#34;This proposal formatted in 12 pt Perpetua&#34; on the cover letter. The problem is that any sans I use looks huge next to it.  <BR> <BR>I have a vague memory of tables that listed &#34;characters per pica&#34; for different typefaces at different sizes; are those still around, or did they die w/ the advent of WYSIWYG? <BR> <BR>Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions -- both in serif and sans -- I&#39;d be grateful. Thx!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I&#39;ve been using some condensed, but they look huge &#40;height-wise&#41; next to perpetua. But it&#39;s not x-height; it&#39;s just that perpetua is small ... or at least this incarnation &#40;Monotype?&#41; is. <BR> <BR>These are rather long and boring texts, written by engineers for engineers. I&#39;d like to make them as readable as possible, while breaking out of the mold. A lot of the competition use arial narrow as a text font -- sometimes further condensed&#40;Eeeew!&#41; in order to fit into the page limits. I want to come up w/ something that is more readable, doesn&#39;t use any more space, and is much more stylin&#39;. <BR> <BR>Thx!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am not sure what you are after, but Futura has  smaller x-height than most sans-serifs. Also the original &#40;not ITC&#41; Kabel. <BR> <BR>Vesta at GerardUnger.com is impressively readable for a sans. Myriad condensed is nice, as is Meta. Benton Sans from Fontbureau &#40;related to Trade Gothic, Franklin, etc&#41; has a number of condensed versions. No sans is as readable for text as any good text serif, in my opinion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You&#39;re trying to strike a balance between apparent size, economy and style. What you should note is: <BR>1&#41; A font with a smaller x-height does take up less room at a given point size, but at the expense of apparent size. <BR>2&#41; The requirement for 12 point &#40;probably&#41; comes from a desire for a minimum apparent size; if you &#34;cheat&#34; by using a font with a small x-height, it&#39;s going to come down to them saying &#34;but it&#39;s too small&#34; and you saying &#34;but it&#39;s 12 point!&#34; You need to try to predict which way that argument would end up going. <BR>2&#41; The larger the x-height, the more economical the face, and the more legible, but also the less readable. &#40;Although there&#39;s certainly a lower limit to the x-height ito readability&#41;. <BR> <BR>It seems that one thing you can do is choose a sans with a small x-height &#40;like Seria&#41;, but that&#39;s assuming they won&#39;t balk at the apparent size &#40;even though it&#39;s 12 point&#41;. Another possibility is to use a sans with a &#34;normal&#34; x-height but set the Perpetua larger &#40;but then things might not fit&#41;. <BR> <BR>If neither of those work, you could always just say less. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I&#39;m going to re-try on the description of my situation.&#41;</i> <BR> <BR>I work at an engineering firm, and I&#39;m trying to create a corp. identity, which includes proposals. Some of the &#34;Requests for Proposals&#34; include a type-size requirement, as in &#34;type shall be 12 points or larger.&#34; They also include page limits. <BR> <BR>In order to fit the verbage into the pages, I&#39;ve been using Perpetua, which is a very small typeface. Not small in x-height, but just small for its size. &#40;In order to make Gill Sans visually the same size as 12 pt Perpetua, you have to reduce Gill to 10 pt.&#41; <BR> <BR>The problem with Perpetua is that it&#39;s a bit spindly for this application. &#40;I create these proposals on a 4-color Xerox.&#41; Another problem is that if I use a contrasting san serif for headlines, it looks huge next to the perpetua, even at 12 pt. <BR> <BR>But now that I&#39;ve used it once, the engineers won&#39;t let me use a &#34;larger&#34; face. So I&#39;m looking for a similarly &#34;small&#34; face that is more robust &#40;thicker hairlines&#41;, plus a companion san serif, to be used in the proposals and other printed material. <BR> <BR>&#40;I hope that made more sense...&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll check out the suggestions already mentioned. Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This has turned out to be pretty difficult; it&#39;s odd to choose a font based on visual size at a certain point measure, and type samples aren&#39;t set up for that sort of comparison. <BR> <BR>So I dug out my copy of Adobe Font folio, to see if I have Kinnesis &#40;I don&#39;t.&#41; But while I was looking, I did find a PDF with a listing of all Adobe&#39;s fonts &#40;at the time&#41;, plus their average-characters-per-pica measure. I had to do a bit of work to get it into Excel, but now I can sort by name and by measure. <BR> <BR>Centaur came up as an option, but it has many of the same issues as perpetua. I love Electra, but it looks wrong at 12 pt: it&#39;s just too big. I&#39;m totally into Octavian ... but it doesn&#39;t have a bold or bold italic, which I really need. &#40;I want to see if I can figure out some alternate font for emphasis, maybe a san-serif...&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, in the Sans world, Bell Centennial Address came in as the smallest font I&#39;ve tested, &amp; surprisingly readable. Ocean Sans &amp; Formata have condensed versions that fit a lot of characters into a given space, but I&#39;m not sure they are going to work in this case. <BR> <BR>If anyone has any other suggestions, I&#39;d love to hear them. thanks!</div>
