  body: I seriously recommend upgrading to Win XP. Windows 98 does not have system-wide
    Unicode support, so your multilingual capacity is pretty slim. MS Office has built
    in Unicode, but most other apps will have only very limited capability. <BR> <BR>Of
    course, upgrading to Windows XP will probably require upgrading your hardware
    also <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

  body: Thank you. <BR> <BR>as I said - I have Toshiba Satellite laptop &#40; Windows
    98&#41;. so just to buy Win XP &#40;cd&#41;, and install it?  orI miss the point,
    and this is more complex?

  body: There have been many models of that laptop. How much RAM do you have? What
    type and speed of CPU? How big is your hard drive, and how much free space do
    you currently have? <BR> <BR>Worst, although it is quite possible to do an &#34;upgrade
    install&#34; that leaves your current OS install kind of intact and migrates apps
    and stuff over to the new one, such installs are often frought with problems.
    Most experts recommend instead doing a &#34;clean install&#34; which wipes out
    your OS and basically hoses all your application installations, meaning you need
    to reinstall all apps. Major pain here if you have a lot of applications. <BR>
    <BR>And if you&#39;re going that far, you probably ought to move the hard drive
    over to NTFS formatting, which means wiping the whole hard drive, including your
    data files. So you&#39;d need to do a full backup of data first. <BR> <BR><IMG

    I&#39;m going to like the PC. One day. <BR> <BR>The lap is 4-5 years old. Never
    used it.  <BR> <BR>I think the best thing to do is to buy a new computer Win XP.

  body: A major issue with new versions of Windows on older hardware is BIOS compatibility.
    Installing Windows XP on a machine that was not designed and built for it can
    cause problems with power management, speed, and even some application running.
    <BR> <BR>Regarding particular specs, you probably want no less that 512MB of RAM
    and at minimum a 40GB hard drive. If you can afford to double those, so much the
    better.

  body: You&#39;d be facing at least some of the same issues if you were moving from
    OS 8/9 to OS X on the Mac. <BR> <BR>How much you need in terms of hardware stats
    really depends on what software you&#39;re going to run. Font editing software
    is not particularly hardware-intensive, and Microsoft office isn&#39;t too bad,
    though it chews a fair bit of hard drive space. <BR> <BR>Which graphics and publishing
    apps will you run? Will you also be wanting to run current games or anything else
    that might tax your speed, RAM, video or storage needs? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>

  body: Video and 3-d imaging are very intensive uses of the computer. Even more so
    than games. <BR> <BR>John&#39;s advice is still good, except that even more RAM
    and especially even more hard disk capacity are big pluses. Also, don&#39;t skimp
    on the CPU too much &#40;although any machine available with 1 GB of RAM and a
    60&#43; GB HD will probably have a fast enough processor&#41; and make sure it
    has a fast video card. Also for the HD, make sure it&#39;s 7200 RPM or better.

    target="_blank">http://catalog.us.dell.com/advisor/advise.aspx</a> <BR> <BR>You
    answer some questions regarding your needs, and it gradually reduces a list of
    recommended machines. Then, once you&#39;ve identified a basic model, you can
    start customising with extra RAM or other options. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t use this
    service when I bought my Dell, but I just tried it now and it recommended exactly
    the machine I ended up purchasing.

  body: Many thanks John &amp; Thomas.  In your opinion - to pay $1500-2000 &#43;-  for
    a custom PC/Win XP - is too much? <BR> <BR> <BR>I hear about InDesign ME &#40;and
    Photoshop ME&#41;, but I don&#39;t see it as a part of the Creative Suite Premium.
    Why? The ME is a plug-In?

  body: 'The current exchange rate is approx. 1.30 CAD to 1.00 USD. <BR> <BR>The Ethiopic
    script is not technically complex, just large. Keyboard layouts are complex, because
    you input the consonant a vowel separately in order to get the single syllable
    character. I did include one OpenType Contextal Alternate &#60;calt&#62; feature
    for Nyala Ethiopic: an Ethiopic number feature that draws a line above and below
    multiple numerals. This is a feature of the script found in manuscripts but, until
    now, has not been done in type. I used VOLT for this, but it is the sort of substitution
    feature that can also be done in FontLab.'

    France for the right to left flow and other functionality for Arabic, Hebrew etc.'

    I upgrade to ME? or do I  need to buy InDesign ME?

  body: Yes, I broke down and got InDesign ME because I had to for a project - it
    includes Hebrew with the vowel points - and because John Hudson was singing its
    praises here. If you want to do Arabic or Hebrew in InDesign, you have to get
    it.  <BR> <BR>I think you would call it an add-on rather than upgrade, but in
    any case you have to pay a lot extra to change to InDesign ME CS from the regular
    InDesign ME. The only one who handles it in the US, I believe, is <a href="http://fontworld.com/"
    target="_blank"> FontWorld</a>.

  body: Oh, and if you only want to design type for one of these languages, and do
    not anticipate designing publications in it, you may do with Microsoft Word, as
    it does Hebrew and Arabic also. John Hudson could give you the info on this; he&#39;s
    the expert.

  body: 'William is right: if you don&#39;t need a professional page layout app for
    Arabic and Hebrew and only need to test fonts, MS Office on Windows is sufficient.
    InDesign ME does have more options for turning on and off individual OpenType
    features, though, and supports stylistic and discretionary justification variants
    that Office does not.'

  body: '&#62;not even Adobe?! <BR> <BR>As I remember, the Adobe site will link you
    to Winsoft, which has outlets in the Middle East, and at its home base in France.
    Evidently Winsoft&#39;s add-on functionalities in the Adobe ME line are done in
    close collaboration with Adobe, but are not Adobe products.'

  body: 'All Creative Suite products come in three language editions: Western/International
    &#40;the one developed and sold by Adobe&#41;, Central European and Middle East
    &#40;both developed by Winsoft <a href="http://www.winsoft.fr/" target="_blank">http://www.winsoft.fr/</a>
    and sold by its distributors&#41;. Note that the CE/ME versions of InDesign or
    Illustrator aren&#39;t just the Western versions with some plugins. Some of the
    core functionality has been changed/extended. So for example, it is not possible
    to install &#34;ME plugins&#34; onto a regular InDesign, but instead, you need
    to install the entire new InDesign ME. BTW, it is very unfortunate that one cannot
    install InDesign Western and InDesign ME on the same machine.  <BR>The Central
    European version includes tools for working with Central and Eastern European
    languages &#40;Polish, Russian, Czech, Ukrainian, Hungarian etc.&#41;, while the
    Middle East version includes _everything that the CE version has_ plus support
    for Arabic and Hebrew.  <BR>Adam'

  body: Sure would be nice to have a pluggin for the Western version which would allow
    CE typography.  Is it that difficult that a whole new application had to be developed?  Sure
    takes the wind out of Opentype concept. Maybe Adobe will do it for next Rev? <BR>
