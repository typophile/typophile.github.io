  body: Does your ISP have a POP before SMTP setting &#40;i.e., do you have to check
    e-mail before you can send&#41;? Some ISP&#39;s do this to prevent spamming. Mine
    does. It made me really mad until I was able to set my mailer programs right.

  body: It is a POP account. Though i have never noticed if i had to check mail first,
    do you mean I actually have to click on the mail &#34;to check&#34; because i
    get alot of junk and just delete such mails. This is all just on my laptop so
    I am not connected to a server, when I connect to the internet I open mail it
    checks for new mails from an account I have with an email provider and some mails
    I hit reply, type my message and that error appears.

  body: that can work too, I think. I set something somewhere in mail to always do
    this automatically. I don&#39;t remember what it was, because by the time I found
    it, I had searched for ever, and was so beat,
