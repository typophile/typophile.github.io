  body: "\"book of zines\"\r\n\r\nI do not know what this means. Who is the target
    audience? What's the book about? How is it being printed? Or is it just a PDF
    for viewing? Is sans serif the usual type of font for your audience?\r\n\r\nYour
    statement that \"I have to make...\" suggests it is a school project. Does this
    mean that you want a font that's already on your computer, or a free font, or
    are you willing to purchase (license) a font for the project?"

  body: it's a book about "fanzines", my target is anyone interested in publishing,
    and people who have been in the movement of zines, and it's a project for a book
    in my university, i'm a graphic design student, it would be any kind of font

    you may want to look at grunge fonts. This recently created thread on [[http://typophile.com/node/97963|grunge
    fonts]] might be a good place to start.\r\n\r\nYou may also find [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/style/Grunge|Font
    Squirrel's filter for grunge fonts]] a good source and the variety of filters

    zines called MOVE - to release a font of his handwriting. He still authors a hand
    made zine called MOVE and we thought his hand lettering was really unique - so
    we made a font of it  - You can see it here : http://www.voltageltd.com/move-zine/\r\n\r\nOne

  body: "There are many types of contemporary 'zines using all kinds of typography,
    as you can see from the link in Nathaniel's post. Restricting yourself to grunge
    doesn't make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nGestalten published a book on the topic: http://shop.gestalten.com/books/behind-the-zines.html\r\n\r\nI
    don't think there's a typeface that is specifically \"zine.\" However, there is
    a common thread amongst 'zine publications -- and that is form, formal experimentation,
    materials and budget constraints. It would be nice if your mode of production
    used in your project somehow recognized these material interests.\r\n\r\n"
