  invite and each printer I have asked seems to suggest something else.\r\n\r\nI want
  the look of French paper, the Speckletone look, but in a paper with some cotton
  in it so that it will take the impression very well. Most of my printers seem to
  feel that French paper is better for silkscreen than letterpress.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know what might be a good choice?\r\n\r\nthanks!"
