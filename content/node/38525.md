  body: "The only problem for mating with Gotham is that--fantastic as Gotham really
    is--it's getting overexposed. The thing is EVERYWHERE. When Yahoo! licenses your
    font and splashes it on their main page, have you jumped the shark in terms of
    cutting edge?\r\n\r\nHF Didot looks great on its own merits, how about a retro
    suggestion? Univers.\r\n"

  body: "I can't visualize Mercury, Didot, and Gotham all in one publication- perhaps
    you can post a mock-up.\r\n\r\nBTW... Why not just use the 6pt or 11pt masters
    intended for text that come with HF&J Didot ?\r\n\r\nJust curious... Mikey :-)"
