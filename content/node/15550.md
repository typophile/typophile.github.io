  InDesignCS, the newest, brightest star leading the way toward the opentype revolution,
  does not have a dedicated, always-open, opentype palette? The only two ways I've
  found to access and enable/disable OT features is by clicking one of two small (perhaps
  10x10 pixel) interface do-dads on the measurement or character palettes, which then
  opens a self-closing 2-level-deep hierarchical menu of features.\r\n\r\nHas anyone
  tried using this on a project with a requiring a lot of manual feature adjustments?<strong>
  IT IS A NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!</strong>\r\n\r\nOK I just needed to rant or hopefully,
  find someone to tell me to shut up, calm down as they point out where the missing
  OT pallette is to be found."

    the existing type palette. It has a tack-things-on-as-we-think-of-them feel to
    it that I associate more with Quark.\r\n\r\nThey could at least do an OT palette
    like the one in Illustrator CS2."

    you create style sheets. It works for either paragraph or character styles.'

  body: "Hopefully CS3 will feature suite-wide consistency of typographic control.
    Presently, all of the applications have different type and OpenType feature handling.\r\n\r\nI
    have posted screen grabs of the OT handling menus in the CS2 apps:\r\nhttp://vllg.com/files/cs2/\r\n\r\nI
    agree that a palette with clear OpenType control options is the best idea, Illustrator
    has this now, but it doesn't seem to support Stylistic Sets or other \"third-level\"
    features."

  body: I've noticed, too, that in Illustrator it is not obvious how to get case-sensitive
    forms to appear (brackets, dashes, etc.). The trick is to use the "All Caps" choice
    from the pop-up on the character palette. Just typing or converting to all caps
    doesn't do it. InDesign does it when you click on the all caps button on the character
    palette.

  body: Mark, that makes sense. Converting Case to caps changes the letters to UC,
    wheras hitting the Caps button makes an OpenType call which includes "case" and
    "cpsp", but leaves the glyphs alone.

  body: 'It would be cool if it happened automatically--less confusing to the user.
    Maybe it could be an additional choice in the OT menu--"Case Sensitive Forms".
    Very likely, though, it would be too tricky to implement that way. I can imagine
    some ambiguous situations. For example: (Apple Computer UK) Do you use the parentheses
    designed for caps or lowercase? I would use the lowercase version in this case.
    The algorithm would have to look at more than adjacent characters.'
