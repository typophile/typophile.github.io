  in a new job leading the interface design for a digital publishers. They have asked
  me to take a look at the brand collateral with a view of updating it all in the
  near future.\r\n\r\nCurrently their logo is lowercase bold Trebuchet, which I find
  ungainly and a bit ugly.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that I could get some suggestions for
  typefaces that are sans or humanist, so some character, not too formal, but also
  not too quirky.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions gratefully received! \r\n\r\nFrank."
