    here) that I automatically went right there. Then again, at least I didn''t say
    it <cite>was</cite> Century Gothic : )'

  body: "<em>Hm. Is Futura something like Century Gothic?</em>\r\n\r\nCentury Gothic
    (top); Futura (bottom). I think the answer is 'yes', however, the C is more open
    in Futura, so I think that is the right pick.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cent_GothBetterNot_3683.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FuturaBetterNot_4400.gif]"

  body: "Mike, which Futura is that? Certainly not Linotype\u2019s. You almost got
    me confused, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Linotype Futura (narrower bowl on R,
    narrower C, wider U)."

    list of Futura's from MyFonts]], it looks like I must have used the Bitstream
    version, because it's true most of the others have the smaller top counter for
    the B. The definitive one should be Neufville's, since that is the source foundry
    for Futura, I believe.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
