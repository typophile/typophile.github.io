    folio is the page number. A blind folio is when a page is counted in the sequence,
    but the number is not actually shown (or \u201Cexpressed\u201D) on the page. So,
    for instance, if a chapter opener doesn\u2019t show the page number, even though
    that page is obviously counted in the sequence, then it is said to have a blind
    folio.\r\n\r\nBlind stamp is when a design is stamped or impressed (usually into
    the cover boards), but not inked or foiled. Also known as a blind emboss.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure exactly what\u2019s being referenced as a Bodoni dash/rule. If I had to guess,
    I\u2019d say it was possibly the same as a swelled rule."
