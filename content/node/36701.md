    He's cute. He can stay.\r\n\r\nI vote for Rubber Ducky!\r\n\r\nNice piece by the
    way. White type on a plain colored background is a good formula. Could use a bit
    more space between \"rubber\" and \"duck\".\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: Yes please. I'd be interested to see what you'd consider a proper amount of
    space. I saw a couple kerning tweaks I'd like to make so I'll incorporate them
    when I see your revision.

  body: "Okay. Here it is.\r\n\r\nThe increase in leading is only by a small amount.
    I went for equal space above \"rubber\", between \"rubber & \"ducky\", and below
    \"ducky\"---to even things out and make it consistent. That was without measuring
    anything tho, to keep it human.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rubberduk_4190.png]\r\n\r\nUsing
    a larger size for \"ducky\" is one way to fill the line width. Sticking with the
    same size and tracking it out as you did is another way. Neither way is \"right\",
    but the technique I used gives more even tone. Some spectators will like your
    approach, others will prefer mine. In the end it's all just different ;^)\r\n\r\nThe
    hue of blue; I'm not aware of an official hue for the stars and stripes, but a
    lot of illustrations of the American flag use blue hues closer to cyan, and sometimes
    pure cyan, as distinct from actual flags (I see them in photos) which tend to
    use a blue closer to midnight, so the cyan-shifted hue seems to be a convention
    in illustration, possibly as a way of exaggerating things, altho I'm not sure
    why.\r\n\r\nYeah, the K and Y could be closer together.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "I brought the spacing on DUCKY closer and made the size bigger; Sort of half
    of each. And took it a little closer to the cyan side, but not as far as your
    sample. It doesn't strike the patriotic chord with me when it goes that far. We
    don't want to alienate the patriots. We'll need all the votes we can get.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as kerning goes, it may be a fool's errand to over-kern a font like this.
    So I'm stopping here."

    realize it was that sensitive a thing.\r\n\r\nIs this better?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rubbaduck_4388.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    top arm of K in this font creates letter fit problems with Y; I changed the serif
    on both K and Y to make them fit better. The space character in this font is a
    bit wide too. The white dividing lines create the impression of stripes, like
    the flag, but some people might think it's too busy.\r\n\r\nAdding \"Vote #1!\"
    where it is---on top of the photo---draws your eye into the image.\r\n\r\nj a

  body: "Great! That was the next idea that popped into my head, adding stars to forge
    a closer link with the flag. Graphic design and typographic design often work
    on suggestion. You have a subject that needs depiction, but drawing it literally
    poses practical problems, so you suggest the subject instead with key details---like
    stars and stripes for example.\r\n\r\nEmbellishments are an aspect, or technique,
    in graphic design you could use to enliven fontplays. Assuming you have a good
    collection of dingbat fonts, don't hold back, let fly with 'em. You're adept at
    coming up with a theme for each piece; look in your ding fonts for dings that
    match key words in the text (this can be time-consuming), and include a few to
    compliment the type. Use them sparingly for an understated effect, unless the
    piece warrants using a heap, like this one does.\r\n\r\nYou see now that fitting
    the K and Y was worth the effort.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
