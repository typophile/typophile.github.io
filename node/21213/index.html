  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am a young adjunct professor at a community college, and today I was telling my class about the importance of using curly quotes or typographer's quotes. Well, one of my students said that she was told by a 'prestige designer' to always flip the quotes so the heavy sides are on top. Then another student said she was told to flip the quotes so the heavy sides are on the bottom. I have looked through my books and searched the internet for an answer because I have never heard this before. Is there any truth in what they are saying? I would appreciate any input on this because it is mind boggling. I've attached a GIF to demonstrate what they are referring to.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Billy

Nothing quite so mind-boggling as students using 'prestigious' but <strong> anonymous </strong> sources to introduce confusion and doubt into the classroom? It happens all the time. 

When I asked a student last year if she'd had any design tutor feedback on her (truly execrable and off-brief) work, she told me in all seriousness '...but my mum thinks it's great!'

Miss Tiffany is right; the default version above is the correct way of setting true quotes.

If your students reckon they know more about setting type correctly than you do, then you could try running <a href="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/">Marian Bantjes type test</a> on 'em. 

It includes the following question

<cite>19. True quotes
a. always look like little sixes and nines
b. have different looking opening and closing quotes
c. are always curly
d. are straight up and down</cite>

Which, although it doesn't provide a straight answer to your question, should reveal enough of your students ignorance to allow some clarification and correction to occur. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there, 

There is a book called The elements of typorgraphic Style, which I am sure some of the regulars are aware of. On pages 86/87, Robert Bringhurst goes into detail about what quotation marks should be used when and where. I take it you are after the British/American version in which case you already have your answer. But it is interesting to know that other countries use them quite differently, SWeden for instance has them set “ “, so the same mark used twice, in Germany the first quote mark is set on the Baseline. And so on.. 

If you want to impress your students then digest this book. Its a good source of details to keep them quiet,

		<div class="commentbody">I think the point is that the type designer should be relied upon to provide proper quotes as well as allowance for language differences. Good OpenType fonts with a decent character set have the needed glyphs to support language variations. The “prestigious designers” who are infallable only in their own minds, are either wrong or misquoted by young students.

		<div class="commentbody">Typographers' quotes are "tradition". At least for the English, Canadians and, even those that say "zee" rather than "zed".

Hand set type was merely the comma(s) set "nick down" rather than "nick up". Hopefully I do not have to give a type anatomy lesson. This saved on matrices, spared room in the case for other needed characters. And frankly gives the written language a bit of extra zest. 

Naturally Monotype was not so lucky. They had to cut punches for both as did Linotype.

Tradition is a "good thing".

I should point out that punches were cut for the apostrophe which made the right hand quote marks or mark (quote within a quote, English vs American bla bla). The left quote marks were upside down comma(s), (quote within a quote, English vs American bla bla)

which of course covers Verdana (as well as this bizarre little practice of flipping the quotation marks around, which is a new one one me!).

Attached is a snippet from my teaching notes I give my students.

		<div class="commentbody">The original question was "Is there any truth" [in the merit of heavy-side-up quote marks].

Obviously, standard practice won't answer that. But it should be pointed out that typography is about standards, not rules.

So, you can look at what's out there in the media and the specimen books, and 99.999% of English setting will be "default", or "standard" quotes. But this was a question to typophiles. Most of whom are conservative (it comes with the territory); but some typographers -- prestige or otherwise -- may want to try something different and daring (not quite Raygun, but nevermind). And it will be considered, rather than a mistake. That goes for the hot sauce package as well as this, from Emigre's <em>Mrs Eaves.</em> specimen booklet of 1996.

		<div class="commentbody">There is another aspect of non standard quotation marks. If a common text with quotes is displayed in Verdana, it looks good in English, but inadequately in German. It looks better when the German end quote is replaced by the English end quote. But that means one must manualy replace all the quotes in a document. When the font is changed, the qoutation marks would be wrong. 
I think designers should design standard quotes in every multilingual typefaces to allow the majority of users to use particular way of quoting. If one wants to create alternative forms of quotes, why not to create "quotedblleft.alt" glyph? There is even a Unicode position for "DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK" at 201F.

		<div class="commentbody">I understand the original question came from a students confusion over conflicting advice; Billy doesn't mention what the subject is in his class, but I would guess that he is not teaching typographers, typophiles or prestige designers (who maybe learnt the rules before setting out to systematically break them).

Anyway, he is teaching students. Misinformation and lack of practice are what most students bring to class; it's their function and they needn't be blamed for it, just corrected wherever possible.

The original question was also not about 'merit' or variable practice – the student said they had been told to <strong>always</strong> flip the quote marks. This is not accepted practice; to suggest otherwise is simply to indulge wrongheadedness.

Marian – I hope you didn't mind. I thought the answer was yours to give away, so I didn't pre-empt it. I owe you an apology for misspelling your name! ooops sorry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I hope this isn’t considered to be too much of a hijack but this thread seemed like a good place to pose this question which has bothered me for a while.

Ok, so I know a lot of programs will change a prime into ‘ or ’ and an  inch symbol into “ or ”. But I do get tired of typing Alt+0145 (etc) into progs which don’t recognise that I’m trying to write an inverted comma or apostrophe... ...or an ellipsis for that matter...

...so, do any of you typophiles know how I can change the keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 etc. to output ‘, ’, “, ”, –, — etc?

Also, am I right in thinking that 1234567890 are “spare” keys since I have two of each of them (my keyboard has a number pad on the right)?

How do you guys deal with this problem daily? Have configured your keyboards differently to the default or do you only use software that  “knows” what you are trying to type? Or am I just missing something? Thanks for any input! </div>

Actually, the question was: "Is there any truth in what they are saying?" -- and it's been answered that yes there is indeed some truth in it, with reference to typefaces by Benton, Licko, and Carter, not to mention a few of my own.

Deviations from the norm exist, and they are acceptable: it's a truth that students should be able to handle.</div>

I would always encourage students to consider the unorthodox design solution. 
But it would be tempting to give billy's smart alec "prestige designer told me" students a good whack with a pica rule.

In this day and age you might have to replace that pica rule with something more available--perhaps " a good whack with a Wacam Tablet" :-)

Absolutely.  There should be no need for the user to fight with work-arounds.

As I pointed out, Europeans are less tolerant of variety in their quotes than Americans -- but there is actually an aesthetic reason, because the "high reversed 9 quote" provides symmetry in the English quote position (see hot sauce package), but not in German "low" position.

<em>There is even a Unicode position for “DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK” at 201F.</em>

That doesn't make sense, because it is not a different character, just an alternate glyph, AFAIK.

Here's another. It's from the AIGA Standard Form of Agreement for Design Services. The PDF said the font was Filosofia so I Googled it and found http://www.emigre.com/ot.php?id=97. I then looked through the specimen guides and that first quote that is nick up doesn't exist! What's the deal here. This issue is still driving me nuts.</div>

As I understand it, some Emigre fonts used to have heavy-side-up left quotes, but the foundry has since switched over to the more usual variety, to accomodate European languages, which is something that today's OpenType fonts are expected to do.

So that's an historic AIGA document that you have.</div>

im pretty sure bringhurst would give me an answer, but i cant find it right now when i'd need it the first time. i know what to do in german texts, but right now i have to make a card with english text in which the client sets some words bold - including one inside quotation marks. all text set in corpid regular 10pt, its only a gift card not a text-spread or such.

first question: would you set the quotation marks to bold, too?
second question: if i use italic instead of bold, what then?

my own visually guided answers:
1. no, it looks worse
2. yes, it looks better.

thanks!</div>
