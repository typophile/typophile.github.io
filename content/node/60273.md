  from ornate initials seen in many typographic executions from the middle ages. \r\n\r\nCan
  anyone suggest a font that has these or perhaps another resource where I can find
  these letters.\r\n\r\nI attach a jpeg of what I mean.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: "That's Victorian, not mediaeval.\r\nSo, it's like the difference between
    Oasis and the Beatles, Green Day and the Pistols.\r\nIn other words a polished,
    stylized elaboration.\r\nI suggest you go to MyFonts.com and search for fonts
    by trying various keywords."
