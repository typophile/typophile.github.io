  body: Actually, this is probably <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/geometric_415_medium/">Geometric
    415</a>, which is a much more common version of [[William Addison Dwiggins|Dwiggins]]'
    Metro. The 'i' dot matches Geo 415, not Metro Sans, which has a larger dot. The
    'U' is probably a customized <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/geometric_415_black/&sample_text=u&sample_size=388">Geo
    415 Black</a> because it doesn't match any Metro black perfectly.

  body: Sorry! I went with my first association without looking closer. You're right,
    Stephen. It's probably Geometric 415...
