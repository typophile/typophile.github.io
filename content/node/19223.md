body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI've been searching for a while if there is a font from
  the example i've attached. This is a photo from a book with an old ad for CBS which
  says ha ha ha (maybe familiar to some of you). It's probably the same font used
  for the cacharel logo. I love these letterforms. I do know it's not one from the
  bodoni family, and some people say it has a lubalin vibe to it.\r\n\r\nthanks in
  advance for your replies,\r\n\r\nThijs.\r\n\r\nexample can be found at: http://www.thijsgadiot.nl/ha400.jpg"

  body: Original done by Lubalin's studio (it's in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0931144280/sr=8-1/qid=1144875142/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1976616-9685602?%5Fencoding=UTF8"
    target="new"><em>Herb Lubalin</em></a> book, most likely drawn by either Tony
    DiSpigna or Tom Carnase or maybe even John Pistilli). Rehashed several times by
    other. Pistilli Roman is very close (though not available in digital font).
