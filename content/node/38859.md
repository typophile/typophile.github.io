body: I'm not sure if this has been previously discussed here, but does anybody know
  the status of David Berlow's crazy-super-expanded ITC Franklin family originally
  <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/pr_display.aspx?year=2004&pr=229">referenced
  here</a> back in 2004?

  body: Interesting. But I don't know why one would want another Franklin (overused),
    when you can have his <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Titling+Gothic">Titling
    Gothic</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Bureau+Grot">Bureau Grot</a>.

  body: I dunno, Stewf -- New York magazine used ITC Franklin Gothic for the coverlines
    and feature heds of its recent design issue (10/29/07) and it looked oddly fresh.
    It made for a crisp counterpoint to the rounded grot they use in the rest of the
    book (Elderkin?), and looked nice paired with Miller Display/Text.

    type specimen booklet that Font Bureau passed out at TypeCon. It lists 2007 as
    the release date.\r\n\r\nJust call or e-mail the nice folks at FB; they'll give
    you the low-down."

    after having a chance to look under the hood I have to say that I am interested
    all over again. '

  body: Hmm. I'll take a look at that, Marc. And I forgot Font Bureau's other mega-grot,

  body: "Thanks for the alternate suggestions, Stephen. I'm a big fan of all of 'em.
    I don't really have a need for ITC Franklin, though\u2014it was just one of those
    \"I wonder whatever happened to...?\" things. Lost in the mists of time? Fell
    victim to legal wrangling? M. F. Benton cursed the project from beyond the grave?"
