  body: Corporate typeface exclusively done for Mr Porter named Brook Porter. As you
    said, Engravers Gothic, as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-gothic/|Sackers
    Gothic]] (Heavy, the closest I guess) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/blair/|Blair]],
    is very close though not matching.
