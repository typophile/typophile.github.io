body: "I am looking for a substitute for a lighter weight of Calibri. Any large(r)
  font families similar to Calibri out there?\r\n\r\nThis is for the on-screen use.
  Calibri is used as a body font and there's a couple of lines of text in the page
  header (set in a larger size) that I need to tie with the body text."

  body: I believe Lucas designed a Light weight, along with some other variants, as
    part of the development of Calibri, but these have never been released.

  body: Jean Paul and Sebastian, thank you. Strangely enough Calibri looks rather
    wide in smaller sizes (~12px), so I'm now leaning towards Gotham and alikes.
