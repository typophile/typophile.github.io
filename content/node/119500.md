body: "I don't speak any languages which make use of cyrillic, so what seems sensible
  to me might seem completely non-sensical to those familiar with the script. To me,
  the alternate forms associated with Bulgarian seem to give the script a more latinized
  feel than other cyrillic-based languages, which leads me to the following question.
  Given the more latinized feel, does it make sense to base the Bulgarian letters
  Ka and Zhe on the Latin letter K rather than on cyrillic? Also, since El often takes
  a more lambda-like form, should de be given a more delta-like form? To clarify what
  I mean, please refer to the following image. The top two rows contain (what I believe
  to be) fairly standard Bulgarian alternates. The second two rows are what I am tempted
  to add to a face, but I'm reluctant to do so without the opinion of an actual Bulgarian,
  or at least someone more familiar with Cyrillic aesthetics.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\u0414 \u0434 \u041B \u043B should certainly be triangular-shaped. For the
    minuscule \u043A and especially \u0436, you should keep the balance in the white,
    so that the arms would not look too much open. As for the choice of terminals,
    ball or serif, it is solely a matter of taste. There are many Cyrillic serif faces
    which do not use ball terminals in lowercase (but I don't like them). \r\nAnd
    you should work more on lowercase \u0432. To make it stop falling on the left
    side, try stabilizing the crossbar. Also try a more straight back, closer to a
    stem of Latin lowercase b, without the bottom spur.\r\n"

    sign</a>. Anyway, these deviations from the \"default\" Cyrillic are not obligatory
    and both in Bulgaria and Macedonia (and Serbia) people are ok with using regular
    Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nBut I agree that creating localized glyph versions is good, as
    long as the glyphs are well-designed and properly coded.\r\n\r\nSince you don't
    speak any languages that use Cyrillic script, I strongly recommend you to buy
    the gorgeous <a href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/izdal/kniga-pro-bukvy2/\">Yuri
    Gordon's Book about Letters</a>. It is in Russian, but it's useful even without
    reading, just for looking at the illustrations. I think you can find one on Amazon
    or elsewhere."

    I expect that you are familiar with Bulgarian fonts in the style of HermesSoft.

    body: "Although I like the works of Oleg Karpinsky and consider them interesting,
      the Cyrillic part in most of his fonts is highly experimental. It may be nice
      but not it's not very practical. For example, he insists that <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/mellnik/\">Mellnik</a>
      could be a corporate typeface. In real life, at least here, in Moscow, Russia
      it would be difficult to find a client that would like to have such unusual
      corporate font and use it in copies of text.\r\n\r\nAlso about the difference
      between letter \u0417 \u0437 and digit 3: in many fonts made in Russia last
      10 years there's a trend to make the letter \u0417 \u0437 with two bowls, while
      the digit 3 with a top right angle. Some consider this construction of digit
      3 archaic, but in Cyrillic texts this differentiation helps. Again, fonts of
      Oleg Karpinsky are breaking all conventions, this one (3\u0437\u0417) as well. "

    In HermesSoft they make it from a rotated <em>g</em> and it looks completely out
    of place and out of historical context.\r\nIn my opinion, the most difficult Bulgarian
    Cyrillic letters would be lowercase upright <em>\u0446  \u0449</em>. I'm curious
    about how would you design the tails."
