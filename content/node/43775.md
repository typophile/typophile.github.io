body: "I just got an email from Undeware (as I'm sure many of you did) about their
  crazy blackletter, Fakir, being chosen for the European version of <em>Rockband</em>.
  This is great news, as they do great work. However the real news is that as part
  of a contest they're running, they're giving away a free \"rock version\" of Fakir's
  black weight for free download.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.underware.nl\">Check
  out their rocking front page with a link to more info and the font</a>. Warning:
  audible rocking will commence upon click."

  body: I saw Rockband last week at Punchcut's office warming party and I have to
    say the interface is one of the best designed I've seen from any video game. Really
    will done. Anyone know the studio that created it?

      would also like to claim responsibility for Rockband using Fakir. Their old
      type guy, Joe, (who presented at TypeCon Boston) asked me what would be good
      and that's what I said. "
