  body: "1. I'm probably wrong but it looks like Times New Roman with a custom /C
    \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/search/bodoni|\xE0 la Bodoni]]\". As it (/C) looks
    pretty horizontally symetric, it could have be done by mirroring the upper half
    part of a regular /C.\r\n2. Looks like [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/s/stark-debonair.html|Starck
    Debonair]] (free version [[http://www.subflux.com/Fonts/FontsRecre_Retro.htm|Retro
    Super Skinny]]).\r\n3. Could be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima-nova-lt/|Optima
    Nova]] stretched (or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/zapf-humanist-601/|Zapf
    Humanist 601]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/classico/|Classico]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/columbia-serial/|Columbia
    Serial]])\r\n4. makes me thinking to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/harry-pro/|Harry]]
    but don't think that's one, may be customized..."

title: It looks familiar, just cannot place the font, so many choices?
