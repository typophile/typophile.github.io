  body: ' The oblique version is very distinguishable from the roman, but not too
    different... it definitely seems like part of the same family. Good job. '

  body: ' Thank you John. I was really going for a cursive feeling with the oblique.
    It&#39;s something I haven&#39;t seen in many screen fonts and I find it quite
    appealing. <BR> <BR>Again, I aplogize about the double post. It was around midnight
    last night &#40;for me&#41; and I had been staring at my screen all day. Just
    took me a couple tries to get it right. '

  body: ' nice! love the italics. the smallcaps seem a bit uneven in width, &#34;A&#34;
    bothers me a bit... seems a bit too wide or &#34;open&#34;, and EFG look narrower
    than the rest... '

  body: ' I think this font has some really great features - including the brave attempt
    at a cursive italic: like that dot on the &#34;i&#34; is genial. But some things
    make me happy I&#39;m not in your shoes on this one! :-&#41;  Also, I&#39;d make
    the smallcaps one pixel taller. <BR> <BR>BTW, your text setting I find pretty
    encouraging. <BR> <BR>hhp '
