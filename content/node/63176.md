    on my screen, a little too assertive. I think it needs to be calmed down, so the
    JK is the main thing, not the color. '

  body: "Nice work Michael... the monogram idea is solid, clean and elegant.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the first thing I thought with the black \"J\" for Jeremy and white \"K\" for
    Katy was 'interracial marriage' or 'opposites attract'. (take it with a grain
    of salt as I've had a rough morning taking care of sick kids) Why not just make
    it all white so it's the coming together of two as one?\r\n\r\nAlso have to agree
    that the hot pink is distracting. How does it relate to the wedding? What are
    the dress colors?\r\n\r\nI know this is a concept but have to point out the inconsistent
    gap on the frame around the monogram, but I trust you'll be fixing that in the
    final."

    circle rather than a square to frame it might make the union more continuous as
    well as invoke the feeling of a ring? I don't know if it would look for better
    or for worse but you might try looking at it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    But moreover, the design is heavy. It's just yelling, \"DUDE, WEDDING!\" But it's
    all scale and color. In other words, less contrast in the color. \r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    quite lovely.\r\n\r\nMills Chris brings an awesome point to the table about the
    nib shape. Top right of the J should be heavier. But....nit pick under deadline.

    rest:\r\nThe color question is moot. As to the execution of the forms... it is
    classic calligraphic manipulation in an effort to equalize opposing weights (color).
    Were it heavied up, in black, it would be oppressive (to the right hand side).
    i.e. the J would be dominant... not what I am trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "When I said 'something is off' about the text, I had a number of guesses,
    but I'm not sure what is the best solution. One is all small caps, as Stefan suggests.
    Another is making the names and 'a celebration of marriage' align right and left,
    and put the date somewhere else. Another is making the JK smaller relative to
    the frame, as suggested above. (You can do all, of course) Another is you doing
    all the text in your calligraphy, etc. \r\n\r\nThe basic JK is fabulous, and something
    the couple will treasure for years. "
