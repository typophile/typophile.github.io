body: "After thoroughly enjoying Bringhurst's \"the elements of typographic style\"
  I was wandering if you could recommend good books or other resources on the combination
  of typography in combination with page design/layout. This includes grid systems
  and theories how to build them and use type within them... Sounds a bit vague? I
  guess, but Bringhurst brought up the topic and just left me wanting MORE! Any good
  tips??\r\n\r\nTHX "

    Lupton is pretty okay. A bit of the content of the book is on the page I linked,
    it also handles grid systems and such.

  body: "Bringhurst (unless the newer editions have changed this) offers a good overview
    of 1930s British typography & the page. While it is still a good model -- and
    still somewhat advocated in some recent books (e.g. Mitchell & Wightman <cite>Book
    Typography</cite>, Libanus Press 2005), it isn't much used anymore, at least in
    the States. In the States, designers seemingly are trying to see who can be the
    first to set 10/16. Since the publisher wants more than 2,000 characters a page
    with a 6x9-inch book, the grid has to be thrown out. This pretty much holds true
    even with the 10/15 settings which a good number of designers have tried. I'm
    holding my breath for that first 10/16 x 26 design. How daring!\r\n\r\nThe Mitchell
    & Wightman offers a good 21st century view of what started with 1930s British
    typography. I must say though that Dutch designers seem to be doing better than
    their US counterparts.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "I can imagine that Bringhurst is not 'used' a lot for commercial work, as
    he is not so much talking about cost-efficiency but more about the 'poetics' of
    the page. It's use of poetical and musicl language to create beautiful pages might
    not be the most concrete and efficient way, but I like the idea of finding meaningful
    ways of ordering the page, and connecting these fields with it seems a good approach.\r\n\r\ncheers

  body: "Partly.\r\n\r\nBut consider too that the proportions Bringhurst advocates
    work best with large format books opened flat on a table. Modern binding techniques
    (i.e., not Smythe sewn) don't really open flat, and the binding removes a considerable
    part of the inside margin. Books are three-dimensional objects; a frequent \"design\"
    error I see is to treat them as two-dimensional.\r\n\r\nAs to The Grid, well of
    course you need one, but one of the best lectures I heard was given by Richard
    Eckersley -- In typical Richard fashion, he told a story of a poor design he'd
    done by sticking to his grid for the front matter. He wound up redoing the front
    matter (for himself, as an exercise, after the book was published) and treated
    each front-matter display page on its own merit (no grid). Much better result.
    Of course, Richard began his career as a poster designer and understands that
    aspect of graphic arts, but spent over 30 years as a book designer.\r\n\r\nAs
    to the cost factor and the commercial aspect, you use less paper setting 10/13
    & having wider margins. Moreover, the small area of publishing I'm involved with
    (scholarly publishing) offers designers less in salary, but far more in creative
    control. It isn't a matter of costs.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Your absolutely right that working out each detail in its own way is always
    better than working with a system or grid, adding more detail to the proceedings
    and working based on the content rather than on the system. But I guess grids,
    measures and systems are also a personal fascination, like finding the 'perfect'
    grid is like finding the holy grail, I know its mythical and not reality but that
    exactly interests me. \r\n\r\nAnother good point is that a book is a 3-dimensional
    object. With program's like InDesign and QuarkExpress one all too often forgets
    this until the book comes back from the printers. Hands on feeling is key to a
    succesful book, however nice the page may be.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments!"
