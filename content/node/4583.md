body: Thanks for glancing at this. Our current logo is a bit complex so we&#39;re
  trying to transition to a simpler high-contrast idea, also we&#39;d like to migrate
  from the full name &#40;new life campus fellowship&#41; to just the letters as a
  standalone name. It&#39;s a inter-denominational university church if that helps.
  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a few first rough steps in freehand, I&#39;d love your input
  on how I should get started. My inspiaration is 50&#39;s countertop modernist retro
  feel. <BR> <BR>How do I keep it from being too comical? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35014.gif"

  body: I&#39;m getting much more of a Trance music feel than a 50s feel - I don&#39;t
    know if that&#39;s good or bad here. Anyway, I like the shapes &#40;but not when
    they&#39;re outlined or encircled&#41;. <BR> <BR>How important is legibility?
    <BR>BTW, when you give the &#34;c&#34; a thick head it&#39;s becoming an &#34;e&#34;.

  body: And I see an h rather than an L for the second character.  <BR> <BR>What about
    a thick, squarish character like M.C. Escher&#39;s signature block?

  body: The logos are not so legible and this might be a problem. Try to work more
    on the shapes on the C1 version...

  body: Dave it looks sloppy. If you like sloppy work then it works. Your n looks
    like a h. I would spend more time reviewing the goals of the organization and
    make the mark reflect the spirit of the goals.

  body: dave, <BR>what is it about the &#34;50&#39;s countertop modernist retro feel&#34;
    that captures the heart of your organization? along with daniel, my reccommendation
    would be to start with that question, and let the design stem from it. <BR> <BR>but,
    if the vibe really is in that vein... <BR> <BR>do you have any other attempts
    that we could see? these are all essentially variations with the same face. <BR>
