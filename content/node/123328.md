body: "Hello Everyone, this is my first foray into making my own typeface. It's based
  on  a mark I created for myself. I started with D, and then I needed letters to
  spell out EVERYDAY. And then I just kept drawing letters\u2026\r\n\r\nFor how to
  approach a letter, I've used Benton Sans Wide and Idlewild as references, leaning
  more heavily on Benton Sans. Though of course I'm trying to bring my own ideas and
  touch to it rather than just copying. \r\n\r\nI'm almost finished with the letters
  and then I'm going to move to numbers and glyphs. It's going to be an uppercase
  only font.\r\n\r\nAny comment, feedback, criticism, etc. is welcome. This is new
  territory for me.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've learned already: the capital S is hard!\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "At the risk of oversimplification, I can offer a very short comment:\r\nMost
    low contrast sans-serif fonts make an optical correction to reduce the thickness
    of the horizontal strokes compared to the vertical strokes -- which produces the
    illusion that the strokes are the same thickness -- unless the objective is to
    produce what is called a reverse or inverted contrast font. An example of the
    latter is Antique Olive.\r\nIf you are trying to produce a reverse contrast font
    then your design is generally O.K. Otherwise the horizontal and diagonal strokes
    look too thick.\r\nDon"

  body: "For similar optical correction reasons the mid portion of a curved stroke,
    such as on the bowl of _D_ is thicker than the straight vertical stroke that extends
    from top to bottom of the the letter.\r\nAgain this is something that you can
    ignore if there is a special purpose for your font. For example, if you are trying
    to produce a font that mimics old time sign lettering by store owners who are
    not professional sign painters, or lettered propaganda phrases painted on walls
    in the 1930s.\r\nDon "

  body: "Adding to Don\u2019s spot-on advice, I would also note that, even in a display
    typeface, the curves of round glyphs should extend a bit below the baseline and
    over caps-height.\r\nHere two primers discussing optical correction:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/29/so-you-want-to-create-a-font-part-2/"

  body: "Thanks all, this is very helpful. I adjusted the horizontal strokes of the
    H and the T, but now looking at it with fresh eyes, the E is way too heavy. I'll
    reevaluate them all. Thanks for the advice on the D as well. \r\n\r\nFor the curves
    I have made the glyphs taller, but I forgot to lower them below the baseline in
    Glyphs. I had manually adjusted a few of them before posting the image, but forgot
    to do all of them. I'll make this change across the board. Thanks for those links
    too.\r\n\r\nI'll post a new sample once I've made these optical adjustments and
    hopefully created more letters.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n"
