body: Please help! I'm looking for this typeface urgently, if you know of a free version,
  I'd be really happy.  I've downloaded TWICE from fonts.com a Congress Sans Extra
  Bold which would need modifying, but it downloads as a mac and not a windows font.  fuming
  is an understatement.

    the logo is rather expensive, is there a close free sample?\r\n\r\nKindest regards\r\nCass"

    need a licence for the <em>whole</em> Meta family, do you? Single fonts are way
    cheaper."

    your answer....  Is bold what you need?  It's only $62. [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_meta_ot_bold/]]\r\n\r\nAnything
    really really close has a name: rip-off.  You'll want the real thing for your
    logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: If you're just going to reproduce the logo, I agree with Jan. It would take
    just a few minutes to draw it.
