body: "Can anyone help me to identify the fonts used by Kurt Schwitters for the covers
  and inserts of his Merz journal? I'm interested not only in the font he used for
  the title (which has been a previous topic on this forum in 2008, though unsolved)
  but also the fonts used for the 5 and the 7 (below) and the ARP MAPPE subheading.\r\n\r\nI
  am fairly certain these are printed from wood type.  We also know that Schwitters
  printed this Merz portfolio (and some others) at the A. Molling print shop in Hannover.
  And that he was  affiliated with the typesetter Paul Vogt in these years (of PEUVAG
  Druckerei).  \r\n\r\nAny insight into what typefaces Molling's shop might have had
  on hand? Would they have been punchcut wood types? Any insight into where they would
  likely have been cut?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"
