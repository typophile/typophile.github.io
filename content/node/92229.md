  of typefaces. I would like to include Didot as one of them but I cant seem to find
  out that much information about its history. \r\n\r\nI already know some bits about
  the typeface and its designer but I'm struggling for its context really - I dont
  know anything about what else was happening at the time and  what made both didot
  and bodoni both design such similar typefaces at similar points in history?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help, Rick"
