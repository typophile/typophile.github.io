body: "Hi,\r\nI was wondering if there is anyway to turn on auto-justification for
  nastaliq kashida ligatures in Indesign CS5? I already have added lots of kashida
  ligatures, and now I am trying to make them \"appear\" automatically when space
  adjusted. So I read through opentype tags, and found table which does the job. Unfortunately,
  it is limited to only init, medi and fina forms... :(\r\n\"The jalt table maps the
  initial, medial, final or isolated forms to their corresponding alternate forms\"\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm\r\n\r\nAlso
  I have seen another rare feature called \"Stretched Alternate\". But I am not sure
  what tag it uses in opentype. Any suggetions? :)\r\n"

  body: Thnx John. My problem is solved using "Jalt" Justification Alternate. What
    i did it is that I let nastaleeq ligatures "rlig" correspond to their kasheeda
    alternates in the "jalt" table. Doing so creates "auto-kashida" in indesign cs5
    when Kashidas and Naskh Alignment is checked :)

    with illustrations?
