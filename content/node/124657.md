    versions of this book (translations, fascimiles, etc.). Using the standard search
    engine for the web there you will find what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nAt your
    own risk, of course."

    Even more to have a look at his designs. I got to see some of those a while back
    in a German museum and it was awesome\u2026 The man had an eye!"
