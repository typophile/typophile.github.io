  body: Century isn't quite right, look at the 'f' and the 'g' especially in the italic.
    The 'a' is off too.

    \r\nI believe it more to be a Didot. Does someone have a sample of Linotype Didot-Antiqua
    made in 1919 ? I found something at <a href=http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/stempel/stempelhistory.html>Luc
    Devroye</a>, but the <a href=http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/stempel/stempel6.jpg>picture</a>
    is  low-res and has only a few letters."

    Besides, early Century Schoolbook doesn't really make sense at all... my haste
    made waste! Patty's still fab!
