body: "Hi everybody\r\n\r\nI will use this font only to set my buisness card etc.
  Thats why I just made the letters I need for my name and my address. I am a bit
  lazy at the moment :D \r\nCapitals, numerals, &, @ and a few italic letters to set
  the URL will follow later\r\n\r\nFirst I made some sketches and tried to experiment
  a bit. It was hard for me to find the right direction in which I wanted to go. After
  a while I had the idea to make something like a \"light, low contrast, brush drawn,
  transitional\"!??! Sounds a bit weird. Thats why I named this stuff after the greek
  goddess of strife <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris>Eris</a href>. After
  a few test I normalized the letters a bit to make them readable.\r\n\r\nI dont know
  if the font works? I hope you like what I have done so far. Do you think it will
  work for small texts or how could I improve it!? Or is this a totally wrong direction
  that i took? Its the first time that I try to make a \"textface\".\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://lastraw.de/Steven/Working%20001.pdf>Working

  body: "I like it a lot. It has a classical elegance with some nice subtle contemporary
    (transitional?) qualities.\r\n\r\nNow for the critique bit...\r\n\r\nI think the
    bent stems on the d, m, n, r and u add an inappropriate quirky element that i'm
    not liking too much.\r\n\r\nMaybe lose the skews on both axis on the i dot, and
    there's a few flat spots that could do with some rounding off, like the tail of
    the a and g, and the top of the f.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the end of the arm?
    (sorry, not up to scratch on my type anatomy) on the r. It seems a bit vague.\r\n\r\nI'm
    certainly no expert on serif text fonts but maybe the bowls of the a, e and g
    need to be a little bigger for clarity at small print sizes.\r\n\r\nBut if you
    change everything i've mentioned it may lose all the qualities you were aiming
    for.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i could see it becoming a very nice and useful font.\r\n\r\nNow
    show us your x ;)\r\n"

    I am a beginner and would be interested in learning what steps / considerations
    you made. Did you start from scratch, did you select a couple of existing fonts
    you liked? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n"

  body: "Mr. Greenslade's right on the money. Your face reminded me of Baskerville
    and its mistress, Mrs. Eaves.\r\n\r\nAnd good Heavens! It's actually usable in
    text size, too, provided that its kerning table is perfected some more."

  body: "Thank you all for your comments so far.     \r\n\r\nDear Mr. Greenslade :)
    \   \r\n\r\nYou are right about what you are saying. But I think I can't change
    the most things you mentioned. Otherwise the style that I actually wanted to get
    will get lost. Exactly like you said.\r\nI tried to make a x but I failed :) I
    will show it later to you. Sunday I will go on vacancy for a week. After that
    I will work again on it :)\r\n\r\nAnd \r\nDear Mr. Pitoyo :)\r\nKerning is a think
    that I have never done before. This is the part where I really need some help.
    Until now the kerning is just improved. But I first want to finish the letters
    before I do the kerning.\r\nSometimes the face reminds me on Baskerville too.
    Mainly in small sizes. I think thats because of the loop of the g. I think I will
    close the loop.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again and please keep commenting this thread.
    I will be back in a week :D\r\n\r\nBye: Steven"

  body: By to by, I also agree with Mr. Greenslade about how your face has a lot of
    quirkiness. However, this can really turn to your advantage because you can make
    <em>two</em> versions of it. One for titling, one for text. The former will have
    tighter spacing, higher x-height, more delicate strokes and so on; and the latter
    will be 'regularized' for text -- maybe buff the strokes a little bit, too :)

  body: "I don't know how to improve them for text and keep them looking good in display
    sizes!? I really like the extreme round part close before the shoulder and would
    like to keep it. It looks a bit italic and more brush drawn!? But i think this
    part have to make it softer to make the letters more readable. To make 2 versions
    would help. I could make a softer \"shoulder\" for textsizes and a rounder for
    display!? But I think that they will differ to much from each other then!? Or
    how should I do it!?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
