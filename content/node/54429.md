  body: "To me, the use of the featured face in the headings is just there to peak
    our interest. I always go to the foundries site and look at it as a pdf or in
    their own presentation. This give the font a more fair viewing. It is sad that
    the nature of the system used to create the Typophile site is not able to show
    the type properly but I would rather have it this way and see new work regularly
    than see just one face always. Some day the technology will catch up to the type
    geeks vision.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
