<div class=commentbody>Not anymore than it can replace the TV or movie theater for watching movies. Ever look at subtitles on that thing?
I think ebooks will be useful for reference books, maybe cookbooks, etc but novels are pretty perfect & perfectly portable as they are and I challenge you to find an ebook that will replace a beautifully designed art book.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A widescreen iPod is still just an LCD, and comes with all the qualities of LCD screens that killed the first round of ebook readers. I'm very excited by the prospect of rendering text with digital ink from Phillips, but since Sony seems to have the exclusive right to market the technology right now, I expect that it will be a while before we start seeing affordable ebook readers–much less ebook readers with an interface that anyone would actually want to use.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/technology/29paper.html?ex=1303963200&en=7c42f0659ee3039d&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">Microsoft's new "Vista technology" for reformatting the New York Times</a> sounds exciting, because I've read somewhere that there will be special readers produced for it that aren't actually full-price tablet PCs. If this "Vista technology" (Cleartype?) end up on low-power tablet systems with bright OLED screens that should start appearing in the next decade it could be pretty sweet. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to sort the truth from the BS that spews forth from the gaping maw of Microsoft's horrid marketing department, so I'm reserving judgment until January.
Of course, if someone doesn't reign in the publishers on the pricing front, it's never going to matter. Consumers aren't stupid, and they know that there's no good reason an ebook often costs as much as a printed version.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know, I wouldn't be so skeptical. It is surly not the ideal format for reading any length of text, but look at what the iPod has done so far. People actually watch movies on them now so there could be a market, especially as the screens get larger and higher resolution.
Related— in Japan (and growing around asia) you can get <a href=http://www.wired.com/news/gizmos/0,1452,66950,00.html>novels to read on your cell phone.</a>
iPods are certainly better displays than phones.

<div class=commentbody>"Not anymore than it can replace the TV or movie theater for watching movies."
Well, it actually has begun to chip away at that. You don't even need cable or a TV these days...just subscribe to the shows you want to watch, put them on you iPod, then watch it on the bus, or hook up the iPod to a TV and watch it full screen.
But, as for eBooks, that 'revolution' has been smoldering for years. And the iPod isn't going to push it over the edge.
I know sony has an eBook reader that has been getting some good praise, but even that hasn't taken off.

<div class=commentbody>I should clarify - I realize people do watch movies on their iPods - sat behind someone watching The Fog of War recently on a bus, but that was the perfect movie for the Pod, just talking heads mostly.
But you can't just carry a movie onto a bus with you the way you can carry a book. Books are kind of perfect that way. They really aren't THAT much bigger than iPods. It is hard to improve on a book... but I'm in publishing so I'm biased.
Personally I'd rather have a book-on-tape on my iPod than try to read it on that tiny screen.
Plus, IMHO the real advantage to eBooks is for reference/search/etc functions which I can't see the iPod really handling at that size.</div>

It sounds a lot better than previous ebook readers, but the interface sucks and it needs to interface with crappy Windows-only software to work. On the upside, Sony learned a lot from the total failure of its Atrac-only digital audio players, so the reader supports ebooks, plaintext, Word files (which is has trouble with), and PDF.
<a href=http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/11/amazon-kindle-meet-amazons-e-book-reader/>Amazon also has a new reader in the pipeline</a>, although it looks like the bastard child of a Nintendo DS and those old flip-top Motorolla two-ways.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Seen quite a few reviews of the Sony product but not one that's seriously looked at the typographic quality of the text. From what I've seen from early screen grabs it's pretty poor with respect to spacing, hyphenation and non-use of typographic features (ie. no small caps, OSF's or ligs) but maybe the retail verison has improved. Anyone seen it?
Cheers, Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>The retail version won't actually ship until early November. It does seem like some the typography would be more a function of the ebook files than the reader, although spacing could be a horrible problem if everything is justified, which I could certainly see Sony doing. </div>

The NY Times reader software sounds compelling. I'll give it a spin on Thursday, I have enough free time blocked in to make it worth turning my PC on.</div>
