  Design Question</a>\r\n\r\nHamburgefontsiv, OHamburgefontsiv, Hamburgefons, or even
  just Hamburg is a common test string for judging a typeface's design or a design's
  progress.\r\n\r\nSeveral foundries have used this word to help assess submissions
  from independent designers, including [[ITC]] during (at least) the 1980s.\r\n\r\nThe
  stringmay have first been created at the [[D. Stempel AG]] foundry sometime before
  the Second World War. Its \"author\" there would have been [[Dr. Rudolf Wolf]],
  who among other things was the designer of the [[Memphis]] type family. [[August
  Rosenberger]] may have been involved. He cut several of Memphis' weights, and would
  later cut designs of [[Hermann Zapf]]'s, including [[Palatino]].\r\n\r\nBefore the
  digital-era, this was by no means a universal string. Several American foundries
  began typeface design testing with the letters <strong>Hono</strong>."
