body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm currently redesigning a website for a shoe company who
  sell moccasins and Native American looking boots. I've been asked to design a new
  logo as well and finding it difficult to create something that is suitably clean
  and simple, yet with the subtle flavour of a native American style.\r\n\r\nI was
  also using Gotham for all body and heading text (for it's American vernacular assosications)
  but just discovered Hoefler and Frere-Jones don't allow their fonts to be used via
  @font-face on websites (which is what I'd like to do).\r\n\r\nSo a couple of questions
  for you:\r\n\r\n1) Does anyone know any fonts I could use as a starting point for
  the logo? I'm not looking for something over the top, or with too much character.
  I'd quite like to keep it simple and fresh, for a fashion brand, but with a touch
  flair and Native American style.\r\n\r\n2) Does anyone know any fonts similar to
  Gotham? I'm particularly fond of the full bodied roundness of it.\r\n\r\nAny help
  or directions you could point me in would be massively appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers
  guys!\r\n\r\nJordan"

  body: "Wow. This is the first time I've checked the thread since posting my questions
    and I'm completely blown away by the amount of responses. Thanks so much for all
    your input guys, it's incredible.\r\n\r\nI would like to respond to everyone individually
    but that seems a bit daunting, some of you pointed out some interesting things
    though:\r\n\r\neliason - Proxima Nova is perfect for the body font, and it's also
    a font used on Type Kit. Brilliant! That's that problem solved.\r\n\r\nKristian
    Sics - Aztlan looks great, I love the way they use it in the pdf. Although I think
    it's a bit too bold and overwhelming for what I'm going for.\r\n\r\ndezcom and
    frode frank - I agree with both of you that a hand drawn face might be better,
    but for this particular brief my client is more interested in aligning the brand
    within the contemporary fashion market, and I've been explicitly told not to 'over
    do it' and to keep it as clean as I can but still reference the American element
    of it. The thing is - their website is full of photographs of moccasins and fringed
    suede boots, so the whole hand made and natural side of it is more than apparent.
    It seems like stating the obvious if I were to do a hand rendered logo, which
    is why I'm leaning towards using a typeface as it would sit more unobtrusively
    on the website, allowing the products to speak for themselves. Although I do agree
    the typeface should be soft and naturalistic. Thinking of a brand like [[http://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/|Innocent
    Smoothies]] - the simplicity of the logo type gives room for the playfulness of
    the logo mark and other brand imagery. Which I think is the same kind of effect
    I'm trying to go for. Having said that... I might try a fairly restrained / controlled
    hand rendered type.\r\n\r\nfrode frank - Those links to the hand lettering are
    beautiful, especially this [[http://www.google.no/imgres?imgurl=http://typophile.com/files/Numbers_5227.JPG&imgrefurl=http://typophile.com/node/47313&usg=__fwBE8Y64AflAKayGj8dlT3lYdhw=&h=583&w=751&sz=136&hl=en&start=5&sig2=evjsub9oj7I0F4cQ_HIwAg&zoom=1&um=1&itbs=1&tbnid=KOS3PsoiXT4JxM:&tbnh=109&tbnw=141&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dnative%2Bamerican%2Blettering%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26sa%3DX%26tbs%3Disch:1&ei=4pWSTJW4MYiLswbVhrGFCQ|cursive
    one.]] Thanks for pointing those out man.\r\n\r\naarhaus - Kabel is very good
    contender, cheers for pointing that one out.\r\n\r\npaul d hunt - tiptoe is also
    a good one. Although there's something about it I'm not so sure about, can't put
    my finger on what though.\r\n\r\nNick Shinn - You're absolutely right, although
    as said before, client is looking to align the brand in a high fashion context
    and over stereotyping could just lead to it looking like a cliche. I think my
    original post wasn't clear and I wasn't sure quite what to ask for, but this thread
    has definitely helped me to think about what to do with the logo. I know I'm looking
    for something simple and contemporary, but to have some humanistic elements to
    it - a subtle nod towards the natural and native side of the products. \r\n\r\naluminium
    - I agree with you, that was my first thought when I chose to use it. But the
    company I'm rebranding are a UK distributor for the original American brand. And
    for a UK audience, to have a body font like Gotham is enough (when put into context
    of the surrounding brand elements) to give a sense of where the products come
    from. Also the Moccasin, when originally brought to the consumer market in the
    early 20th century, was sold as a souvenir item. And it was your white middle
    class families on vacation that bought them - since then the moccasin has become
    a relaxed, casual, house ware shoe (in America especially or so I'm told), so
    the idea of referencing white America is now just as much apart of its history
    as its natural, native counterparts. For us Brits at least anyway.\r\n\r\nI may
    come back when I've got some logo designs to show you guys.\r\n\r\nThanks so much
    for all your help, keep them coming if you think of more. \r\n"

  body: "In reality there really isn't a specific 'Native American' (USA title, or
    preferred to be called First Nation/Aboriginal to the rest of the world) style
    font, if it is, typically its really cliche and straight cheezy. Anyways the main
    font used before, used to be Papryus till every designer in North America OVERUSED
    it on everything cultural/ethnic, and now its just not a good looking font anymore,
    it was nice if used in a small title like way, but its life span is now over.\r\n\r\nSo
    a similar version to Papryus I found was [[http://www.windowfonts.com/fonts/fine-hand-let-plain-1-0.html|Fine
    Hand LET Plain:01]] it kind of has a rustic look to it, with its fabric like edges,
    this would be good for a small title/headline, and nothing more than that.\r\n\r\nBut
    in most cases, I just prefer to use what I typically use for any other headline/title
    and body text, suitable for the main target audience (young, old, edgy, conservative,
    playful, grand, excitement etc.) and use the logo and design aesthetics to show
    the First Nation theme, as that is my design specialty, considering I am of First
    Nation's ancestry, from the Pacific Coast of British Columbia, Canada.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck! & show us your finished logo after!"
