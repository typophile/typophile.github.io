  by hand.\r\nHow do you guys handle crappy Word files? (It's lots of text 200 pages
  A4 [Times 12pt] with lots of superscripts, headers sub headers etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHi
  There,\r\n\r\nMy first post here, hope someone can help me!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to
  find the right workflow to import a Word document with it's paragraph styles still
  intact and then modifying them.\r\nI want to do this so I can use the headers, quoted
  texta and plane text paragraphs and change them. In that way I don't have to select
  text and apply the styles by hand.\r\n\r\nI can get the text to import with the
  paragraph styles but then when I go and change the styles it goes wrong.\r\n\r\nThis
  is what I did:\r\nI placed the text, checked the \"show import option\". Made sure
  the \"Preserve Styles and Formatting from Text and Tables \" was checked. Let the
  text Auto Flow holding down Shift.\r\n\r\nAll goes well up to this point. Al the
  paragraph styles are imported. \r\nWhen I select some text the paragraph style for
  this text is highlighted in panel so all whent well.\r\n\r\nProblem is, having the
  text selected: the highlighted paragraph style is also showing the + symbol. Meaning
  there's local formatting done. The selected text is 10 pt, but when I bring up the
  corresponding paragraph style I see it should be 12.\r\n\r\nSo now I have to remove
  the + (local formatting) without having to select the text.\r\nI tried to use the
  \"find and change\" function, there I selected the paragraph style and replaced
  it with a new one. But it didn;t find all the right text.\r\n\r\nIf someone had
  a similar problem or knows a better workflow to all of this, please let me know!\r\nCheers
  Heyman\r\n"
