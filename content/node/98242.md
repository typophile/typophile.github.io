  body: Agree with Renko even it's hard the see differences at first look (/K is the
    more obvious). Reminds me of somehow [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiffany/|Tiffany]]
    (mainly Black style) because of /A, /R and /K design. Another interesting one
    is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/|Ronaldson]], using some
    alternates (for /A). For what it's worth,  if I have to reproduce it, I would
    probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman-modern/|Nimbus
    Roman Modern Compressed]] and customize it "a-la-Tiffany".
