body: I'm looking for a font for a project to do with organic food, farming and conservation
  of the land etc. In my mind I want something earthy and friendly, a bit quirky but
  still legible. Anyone got any suggestions? Sans serif, serif or display all possibilities.
  Thanks!

    and their Sauna and Bello. Also ''earthy, friendly and quirky'' describes <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-goudy-sans/">Goudy
    Sans</a>, so you might consider that also. '

    is fairly extensible and has a very soft, postmodern feel. (The price is also
    right.)

  body: A little late into the discussion, but i'm searching for a font family for
    a similar purpose. Something to carry through the catalogs, packaging, signage,
    etc. These are al great choices in general, but any suggestions for a more modern
    feel and not so "granola?" (I love Sauna and am considering Rotis Semi-Sans so
    anything along those lines...)

    \r\n\r\nI am looking for a font that is clean, understated and contemporary. I
    want a font that looks soooo good with out screaming look at me. A font that a
    designer might say \"I want to know what that font is. A font the average consumer
    won't see anything unique with but they will sense quality. A font for an organic
    wine consumer who shaves her legs (target market). \r\n\r\nAm I asking to much?
    I thought I'd toss it out there."
