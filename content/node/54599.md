body: The guy is a piano player. Some jazzy touch, but really more of a ballad kinda
  thing. The keys are playing an "e". The type is custom. What do you think?

  body: Thanks, I'm aware of that one. Didn't link them though, but there's an obvious
    similarity:) I'm in a rather different field with what I'm doing, I'm not implying
    precision (a ruler) but music (a piano).

  body: "Yup. The \"Precision\" logo is mine, and yours <em>is</em> quite similar
    visually. I agree that the concept is different, but in the end it's the appearance
    is what ultimately matters.\r\n\r\nBut even the similarity aside, the stack of
    bars doesn't really resemble the piano keyboard to me. Perhaps consider stylizing
    E as 3 white note keys and 2 black note keys instead ? \r\n\r\nThough the 3+2
    concept also has been done few times before, including <strong>[[http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/40832|this]]</strong>
    version."

    if not in key shape, it will make a white/black pattern of a piano...\r\n\r\nY'know

    stuck on this one. Except for the type, which I've spent a lot of time on, there's
    no striking ideas out there yet. Thing is, it's a project for a buddy and he never
    have the time to really sit down and talk. I've gotten no real hints on what he
    is looking for. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andycandy_5163.png]\r\nWe
    did talk about maybe doing some kind of signature, though. "

    gibberish. They look cool, but the name isn't legible at all. IMO, that's a huge
    problem. \r\n\r\nI like the elongated crossbar, but honestly, it's been done to
    death. \r\n\r\nIf it were me, I'd stop working on it all together until Andreas
    can sit down with you and vet some ideas. Otherwise, there's a giant chance all
    this work is for naught. \r\n\r\nAK\r\nPS. Thanks for the chance to use the word
    naught. Doesn't happen often!"
