  \ I want my web maps to be well-designed, not just functional...but I don't have
  any design experience at all.  Any ideas on a good font for road labels?  It has
  to be readable at small sizes and to follow curves well.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    font" but as promoted by info graphic expert Edward Tuft as a really good font
    for small info.

    for cartography]] \r\n\r\nThe Swiss designer/typographer Felix Arnold designed
    Cisalpin during the late 1990s, after he had challenged himself to create a contemporary
    typeface that could be used for cartographic uses. Arnold came to the subject
    of cartographic typefaces after analyzing many maps and atlases, and discovering
    that there was no standard typeface for these types of documents."

    in which they wrote of the virtues of using hand lettering, or typefaces that
    resembled hand lettering, for maps.

  body: "Cisalpin, a sans serif,  would seem to win the prize for clarity in messy
    situations and at small sizes.\r\nThere are serif cartographic typefaces that
    have variations for specific information, e.g. rivers as opposed to cities. For
    example Roemisch http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roemisch/ and Kursivschrift

    experiences with fancy fonts and my advise is to use for road labels extremely
    readable condensed fonts like Arial Narrow.\r\nIf you are ready to buy one, here
    you are a commercial font designed for cartographers: http://www.linotype.com/2276/cisalpin.html\r\nAndras"

  body: Would you consider commissioning something new? A map typeface to be used
    online at small sizes have very specific requirements. You need large apertures,
    big x-height, simplified features, clear contrast between various pieces of information
    and possibly condensed styles, maybe a set of symbols, and all of it has to be
    hinted to render clearly across all modern browsers.

  body: "If the font needs to \"follow curves well\", doesn't this mean it will be
    used in generating map images, rather than used in a web font?\r\n\r\nOf course,
    there are some presentation techniques used on the Web that do allow text to be
    laid out in curves - PostScript, and hence one's map could be an Adobe .PDF file.\r\n\r\nAh,
    I see I'm out of date. Text in Google Maps sometimes follows curves."
