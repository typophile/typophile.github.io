body: "Hello Typophiles, been a while since I've been on here, hope everyone is well.\r\n\r\nI
  have recently accepted a design job, nothing too strenuous, and I was thinking about
  designing a custom handwritten font. This would be the first time I've properly
  attempted to design one (handwritten or not), and I want to learn more about the
  misty realm of contextual alternates. \r\n\r\nI was reading an excellent article
  about them, written by Nick Shinn, someone who I believe roams the forums here,
  but I still have a couple of questions and I hope you can all help.\r\n\r\nFirst
  of, do you need them to properly execute a handwritten font? Attached is a sample
  of the style of handwriting I'll be emulating (not looking for critiques just yet,
  and yup I will be increasing legibility) so you can judge it subjectively...\r\n\r\nSecond,
  should I outsource the scripting job to someone with more experience? I have no
  fear designing the font and the alternates myself, but actually publishing the font
  and creating the script required might be a little out of my comfort zone.\r\n\r\nThirdly,
  if I do decide to take the challenge on, what program should I be using to write
  the script? And will Fontlab Studio work with it? (I work on a Mac, and craft all
  of my draft glyphs in Illustrator, if that is relevant).\r\n\r\nForgive my ignorance,
  I'm only starting in this business and eager to learn\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nchillyphilli\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5895.jpg]"

  body: "Your choices for \"programming\" contextual alternates are MS Volt (GUI,
    Windows only), writing [[www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html|feature
    files]] by hand (you can either then \"compile\" them using Adobe's AFDKO command
    line tools, or from within FontLab), or FontForge which have both GUI for OpenType
    code and can import feature files.\r\n\r\nIt can be a bit of learning, especially
    if you want something \"clever\", in addition to the usual font development stuff,
    but nothing can't be dealt with given enough time."

  body: "If this is your first font, I suggest you team up with someone with a little
    more experience. There are plenty of caveeats, and scripting is the least of them.\r\n\r\nA
    certain degree of randomness is often called far when emulating handwriting, and
    scripting a (pseudo) random feature using multiple sets of alternates is a fairly
    easy task. With Type 3 you could even mess with the curves, but this format is
    by and large defunct by now. I also suggest (as someone once suggested to me)
    you explore how the writer adapt his/hers writing to context."
