  they spell out 'A little golden book\" classic in that simple cursive font. Is it
  something available out there? If not, is there something comparable to it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/center_4991.gif]"

  body: "I think Ray's suggestion is one of the best I can think of too, but another
    choice might be Canada Type's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/birthday/\">Birthday</a>,
    by Rebecca Alaccari. It has the same sort of looping ascenders and monotone strokes
    that we associate with children's handwriting.\r\n\r\nThe odd feature of the Golden
    Book script is the G is  more of a printed style, compared to the L and B. That
    mix is hard to find, and most scripts are more slanted.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
