  lots of different weights for the body text. I like this magazine sample below and
  would appreciate it's identity if possible.\r\n\r\nOr if anyone has any suggestions
  for body text fonts they would also be most welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nSimon[img:sites/default/files/old-images/magazinefonts_4301.jpg]"
