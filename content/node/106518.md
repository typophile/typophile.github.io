body: "Opentype is the most common rendering engine which has facilitated implementing
  Arabic script and so many other non latin writing systems in computer. But apparently
  there are many shortcomings in opentype and tools which are used to develop arabic/persian
  fonts using opentype. Part of these problems stems from the fact that the geniuses
  who have created the tools were not familiar with the nature of arabic script, so
  they have tried to solve the problems using the ideas they have learned while they
  were trying to implement latin script in computer. Other problems comes from the
  restrictions in opentype language, which is developed to be understood very easily
  and it made opentype an inflexible computer language. Opentype is a great invention
  and maybe there is a way to overcome these problems and a discussion about this
  might bring new ideas and help the developers and other people whom are trying to
  use opentype for rendering arabic script in computer to solve their issues.\r\n\r\nI
  start with a topic here but it will not end here:\r\nPositive kerning\r\nPositive
  kerning between connected letters is not straight forward. We don't have proper
  tools to implement it and some tools which are developed for this purpose have problems.
  In this example which I'm showing a sample of Adobe Arabic font, you can see that
  when a short kashida is inserted between two letters in order to avoid collision
  of dots and diacritics; mark positioning breaks on the first letter. Problem here
  is not critical but what if a designer wants to use dots as diacritics when he is
  developing a font? in that situation he will not be able to use positive kerning
  in this situation (actually there is project and one of my colleagues has this problem).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arabic-diacritic-kashida-problem_6044.png]\r\nSo
  far I haven't found any solution to this. First I thought reordering of features
  might help, but apparently mark positioning is placed after contextual alternative
  feature in VOLT, and I couldn't find any GSUB feature that could be placed after
  mark positioning. I think solution would be a flag to ignore certain glyphs in mark
  positioning lookup. In opentype we have a flag to ignore marks but we don't have
  a flag to ignore some glyphs like this short kashida. What do you think?"

  body: "Bhaman, in your illustration, it looks very much like the vowel mark is being
    ordered after the kashida glyph, and this is why the positioning is broken: in
    fact, the mark is being positioned relative to the kashida, rather than relative
    to the preceding letter. This implies the glyph order after GSUB is\r\n\r\n<code>yeh.init
    kashida kasra alif.fina hamzabelow</code>\r\n\r\nIf you restructure the contextual
    substitution so that it inserts the kashida before the second letter, rather than
    after the first letter, that should solve the problem. In VOLT syntax, the example
    you give could be handled like this (presuming NFD decomposed text):\r\n\r\n<code>alif.fina
    -> kashida alif.fina</code>\r\n\r\nin context\r\n\r\n<code>yeh.init kasra | hamzabelow</code>\r\n\r\nand
    the resulting glyph string should be\r\n\r\n<code>yeh.init kasra kashida alif.fina
    hamzabelow</code>\r\n\t\r\nand your kasra will be positioned on the yeh.init base."

    of other options that didn't' work but your option is pretty much easier and it
    works! :D\r\n\r\nThanks John"
