  to every empty cell I see in FL, it's addicting. Nonetheless, I think it's time
  to stopp adding glyphs and concentrate my energy in other things like spacing, kerning,
  overall balance of each glyph and so on...\r\n\r\nSo my question is: Which \"average\"
  or common codepages should I completely fill to make my font functional? Currently
  I have 439 glyphs spanning a lot of codepages (my main goals are to provide basic
  latin support plus Russian).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nFrancisco"
