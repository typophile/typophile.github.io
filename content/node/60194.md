  I maybe made mistake using this character set for making fonts.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  tell me whose set should I use: Windows or Mac or ISO 8859? Does this mean that,
  for example, if fonts were made using Windows character sets that thay may have
  a certain problems on Mac? Or using Mac's set on Windows?\r\n\r\nI didn't mentioned
  Adobe's sets, since I personaly think that OS are more relevant then \"lower\" applications
  in system. Correct me please if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    side :)
