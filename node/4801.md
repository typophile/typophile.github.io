  body: I think maybe done by hand? The S doesn&#39;t match either Sackers or Engravers,
    and other characters fail to match Trade Gothic Extended, which was my other guess.
    It&#39;s not Burin Sans either. I&#39;m out of options. It&#39;s very nice.

  body: "Custom, certainly. Closest fonts I know are <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/club_21/frieze_ot/\">Frieze</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/sassoon_infant_by_linotype_dotted/\">Sassoon
    Dotted</a>, but these don't have the rigid structure of the Care logo. If you
    want a similar look, I'd follow the midline of a linear serif with dots.\r\n"
