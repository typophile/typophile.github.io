  body: "<blockquote>Which one? Which one do you trust to do what you want it to do?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nExactly,
    although written with good intentions, well meant lists such as the Vignelli Canon
    are to be read in the perspective in the time they were written. Still Caslon
    is probably Monotype Caslon or Linotype Caslon, although at that time, Berthold
    Caslon was superior to them. Still Bodoni is probably Linotype or Monotype Bodoni,
    although they did not resemble Bodoni\u2019s typefaces because the drawing room
    people (including those at Berthold) were taught that Bodoni had to have a look
    that was \u2018as cold as the Alps\u2019 (citing Updike) and that therefore(?)
    the curves had to be drawn with lines and arcs. Bauer\u2019s foundry type was
    better but at the time Massimo Vinell wrote his list, there was no supplier of
    photocomposition machines that had a decent version (i.e. suitable for small sizes)
    of Bodoni in its typeface catalogue. Monotype Bembo suffers from weak details
    (such as the curves in the diagonals of the K that were merely an invention of
    the drawing room) and the photocomposition and digital versions never managed
    to capture the lower contrasts of the smaller sizes needed for offset printing
    of text matter. Also check Tim Ahrens on optical scaling for what happened after
    that.\r\n\r\nSumming up all this, combined with the good and serious work that
    has been done on text faces in the last 25 years (at the aforementioned foundries
    as well as many new ones), these lists have become nothing more than \u2018name
    dropping\u2019. Ignoring that development is indeed a bit disrespectful and above
    all, it unveals that some modernists have difficulties to cope with the better
    part of the outcome of the progress they were after."

  body: "In practice, I only use a few. And I think most do. But I'd rather each person
    use their own few than every one using the same few.\r\n\r\nI think I use Lucida,
    Georgia, Helvetica, and Times the most daily, along with a large variety of Webfonts,
    of which I have some favorites. But this has to do with the fact that I do web
    development, and these are defaults that \"just work\". If, for instance, somehow
    Franklin Gothic had been \"chosen\" for the default instead of Helvetica, we would
    all use Franklin and not know the difference."

  body: "<blockquote>how many text faces does a bloke need?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHow
    complex is the human subconscious?\r\n\r\nA big part of text fonts is about emotion,
    just like with display fonts, but on a different -deeper- level. The smallest
    flick in somebody's lips reveals a subtle emotion. You can't put your finger on
    what the flick looks like, but you can feel it. And people who can design for
    such feelings are qualified to make text fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that no more typefaces are needed, ant type designers should just give up. However,
    even so, it is <em>also</em> true that, for the most part, typographers will achieve
    better results by sticking to the basics.
