  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK, yesterday I rejected Freight Sans for a project. It's simply beautiful, but I believe its narrow word spaces hinder legibility, especially in comparison with other humanist sans faces.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freightsans_3885.gif]<br>
<br>
<br>
This morning I briefly considered using TheSans, until I got a look at that uppercase "Q" with its disconnected tilde for a tail. Please, Lucas! I absolutely love TheSans, but no alternate for that Q?!!
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheSans_6540.gif]<br>
<br>
<br>
So it got me thinking... What common typefaces are "spoiled" for you by their quirks? And what makes these features deal-breakers?

Thanks in advance,

I think you'll agree that Freight's default wordspaces make it harder to read than a good number of the others. I was resetting a huge, multipage document in an old version of InDesign, and it was a "get-it-out-the-door-NOW" scenario. Guilty as charged.

I guess the tight default wordspaces are not really a deal-breaker, but they got me thinking about this pet peeve topic.

Hope that makes more sense,

Since we are living in the world of scaleable type, one could argue that there is only one instance where a font will work "right out of the box". All other instances will require some user modifications, to word space, letterspace, kerning etc. It seems that your "out of the box instance" and Freight's "out of the box instance" are two different things. I guess that is going to leave you with an awful lot of pet peeves.

		<div class="commentbody">Nice thread idea, Michael. The Thesis Q is something we hear about at FontShop at least once a month. I know more than one company that has created and licensed their own version of the font with a more reasonable tail.

Adding to the pet peeve pile: @-signs that sit too high. It's amazing how many type designers are still plopping the @ circle on the baseline. I assume they haven't broken free of the pre-digital era when the symbol was aligned with lining numerals instead of lowercase. The more thoughtful type users will see this and baseline shift, but it's often overlooked.

I have beefs about nearly every Emigre font, which results in my not using them that often. The a in Priori, about half the letters in Dalliance, etc.

Today Sans has the ugliest ampersand ever.

My biggest beef however is incomplete character sets. I need fractions and it drives me crazy when they only include 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4.

I love the Q in TheSans.</div>

My hope is that with the slew of their new OpenType releases, they do improve the kerning table. Maybe then we'll consider sparking another "Mrs. Eaves for body copy" topic :)

The Q in TheSans I have mixed reaction of. I love it, but it's not as flexible as the regular Q construction -- not that you would use it that much.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>@-signs that sit too high.</cite>

To me, not just the @ sign, but the copyright symbol ©, parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}, as well as the slash / and mathematical operators, sit too high in most fonts—especially when used with old-style numerals. (In Adobe Caslon, even the hyphen, the en dash, and the em dash look too high to me.)

Parentheses, brackets, and braces also tend to have too little space “inside” them. Actually, I find even periods and commas too tightly spaced in many fonts—for example, the ubiquitous Adobe Garamond Pro (the same goes for many of the kerning pairs, e.g. Ta To Te Tu).

These are part of the reason why I would want to be allowed (by the EULA) to modify the fonts I use.

In ITC Mendoza, I didn’t like the old-style numerals 1 and 3, so I made my own versions (thought 3 didn't turn out that well), along with “correcting” many of the things that I mentioned above.

EDIT: I do understand that those of you who design type from scratch might not be too happy about the thought of someone modifying the actual outlines of glyphs (esp. when that someone is a beginner like me). But fonts aren't really works of art, are they?

But to go back to the start of this thread, I think the <em>character</em> spacing is too tight in most sans fonts—especially the lighter ones. For example, Frutiger Light is much less readable than the normal weight (Roman). Sans fonts, of course, have the problem that when there are no serifs to tie the characters together, spacing that is loose enough for readability tends to look too loose esthetically (so I don't like to use them for extended texts). Just my two cents' worth.

Keep in mind that Bell Gothic was originally designed for telephone directories. Also keep in mind the existence of CamelCase names. Once I came across the name "DiIorio": that's dee-eye-eye-oh-ar-eye-oh.

Personally, I hate that "I" and "l" collide in too many sans-serif typefaces to list.

As for confusing characters: I hate the "0" (zero) as it appears in the modern take on oldstyle figures. When I saw "1950s" (or something similar) in a book once, I parsed it as "195 os" before inferring the meaning from the context.

Note to typographers: The outline for a proper oldstyle zero as used in old books is a perfect circle (<em>circle</em>, not oval or anything else) inside another perfect circle. That's it, that's all.</div>

My main gripes are the following. I prefer umlauts that harmonize with the dot above the "i", they may be a bit smaller but not tiny. Others may think differently.

I dislike:
* fonts where the umlauts don't have the same basic shape the dots over the "i". For instance, in ITC Frankling, with round umlauts and a square "i" dot.
* also fonts where the umlaut dots/squares are tiny and not of the same proportion as the "i" dot. Example: Bitstream Franklin.
* fonts where the umlaut dots are placed too close together. Like Bitstream Franklin, again.
* Typefaces where the umlauts on the capital O sit like little ears almost on the sides. Like Typeshop Franklin (simply impossible to use).
* as an example of great umlauts in a Franklin, check out the Eisner+Flake cut. Now that's good umlauts and my favorite Franklin. 

That's just off the top of my head. In fact many great cuts are ruined by poor umlauts.

I think it's pretty obvious that Swiss or German designers (languages with umlauts) pay more attention to this whereas for instance English- or French-speakers often do not.</div>

I can't name any fonts offhand, but for one thing, I remember seeing umlauts that are too small (and perhaps sit too low), thus looking like insignificant flyspecks. The umlauted version represent different phonemes than a and o, so the umlauts are important.

Also, Tä and Tö kerning pairs are often too tight.

I've never had trouble using it, in either display or text settings. It's easy to work with, which is to say it's character spacing and it's kerning tables are good and do not require further fine-tuning. It's a very well designed face. (family of faces??)

Though quirky, I love the Q. Especially in text. In English, the Q occurs infrequently enough to give bodycopy (set in TheSans) more personality than, say, Frutiger. Without overdoing it.

However, now that one of my fave faces has properly been defended from you scurvy lot, I wholeheartedly agree with Michael's observation that an alternate Q would be a good thing.

Whoa, one tough customer! You know sight unseen that it won't be worth buying, even if upon completion it has achieved my goal of being far more readable and inviting than any other digital Caslon?

Fontbureau's fonts are great, and also pretty extensive but as a result I'm only gonna buy it if I can swing the whole collection, and when you add it up... big bucks. I already have a ton of text faces so nowadays I'm more inclined to buy one-off display fonts when I need them for a job.

This may be a screenfont issue.  Screenfonts have to find a happy place where a 2-pixel wide and a 1-pixel wide stroke work well.  This means  small shifts are not possible as they are in fonts made for print. This is a similar problem to small type designed for use in phone books being enlarged for use as display type.  Sometimes the specific intent of the font precludes its use outside of that arena.
I would be curious to see if the German speakers here on Typophile can point to some examples of very good and bad umlautes in fonts and tell us why this is so. The same is true for any diacritic glyph.  I was quite happy to see Oscar Bjarna, an Icelandic speaker, comment on glyphs peculiar to his language in a previous thread.

In my expirience readability is increased if the dots-part is a bit smaller then the letter below and placed a bit lower then upper-case letters tops. A to great difference in  size and placement between the umlaut-dots and the i/j-dot seems odd to me.

Another issue is whether the dot on the i and the umlauts should be the same height. If I'm not mistaken the dot on the i is often higher. Looking at Georgia in my post, in 'pünklich' they seem the same height. Surprisingly to me, in Trebuchet in your example, the umlauts are bigger and higher than the i dot.

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>The reason I ask is that in the original Caslon a high, heavy dot on the i and j is part of the ‘look’ of the face. For my Caslon I have to decide what to do. Of course Caslon himself was producing for England and its colonies so the umlauts probably weren’t an issue. One possibility might be an alternate i with a lower dot for setting German language.</cite>  

I think in your case i would prefer to keep the typical i-dot in german too. There seem to be room to place the Umlaut-dots a bit higher without getting them to high. 

<cite>edit: I just saw your graphic—did you post it after the text? The ninth in the list has a considerably higher i dot. Is that one Ok to your eyes? Galliard?<cite> 

Yes I posted it afterwards. The ninth is Day Roman and I think here again that the difference is too big. Still suitable for small texts though but not for long ones. </div>

I just wish I had an alternate "Q" to work with. To my eyes, everything else... and I mean EVERYTHING else... about the entire Thesis family is perfect. I just found it unsuitable for a "Q"-heavy project.

OK, onto more pet peeves...

1) The lack of a true italic for Syntax. (Why pair an oblique with a humanist sans?)
2) The above-cap-height ascenders & below-baseline descenders of Eidetic Neo Omni (Rodrigo might kill me for saying so... I'm one of the people who suggested he create a unicase version of Eidetic way back, but unicases don't usually have ascenders or descenders...)
3) The too-narrow-for-my-tastes italic of Joanna.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, all, for posting images of diereses and i's together and discussing them. This is useful information for a type designer, book designer or graphic designer, since we all are likely to deal with multilingual texts going into the future. Does anyone have comments about the height of accents over capitals? 

It's little things such as have been mentioned here, which are deal-breakers for me in purchasing a type family for general use; if I spend a few hundred dollars for a tool, I want it to work all the time, as well as it can. As James points out, no type works perfectly in every setting, at every size, without some modifications. But individual letters shouldn't bother the user. 

There were problems with every humanist sans I knew about, when I started drawing Mundo Sans; the obliques in so many (Syntax), irritating spurs and curved terminals (Today, Gill Sans), and other things like the narrow oldstyle 5 and unjoined Q in Thesis. Some were spaced obviously for display, some had proportions that wouldn't work below 24 point. I wanted a family that could work at a lot of sizes; Syntax starts to look weird at display sizes, as does Gill, and others like Formata look regimented and square in text sizes. Gill's weight progression is bizarre; the mismatch of weight and contrast between the caps and lowercase always bothers me, as do some of the wide caps. Mundo is meant to have a wider range of sizes it performs at, without any distracting bits. Unfortunately you can't space a typeface to look good at every size; the only typeface I think does this well is Frutiger, and some weights are spaced tighter than others. 

Yes, I'm very very picky. If I hadn't drawn Mundo, I'd probably be using Kievit. </div>

In a displayfont anything that looks good is fine to me. In continuous text I would prefer to keep them low and as flat as it is possible while preseving the typical character. If the accent takes too much space it can look realy bad. That is the reason why in some languages accens on capitals are optional (i.e. in french). </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great thread Michael. I agree with what you say about Syntax and Joanna (although the Perpetua italic is pretty darn narrow too – it was just the Gill style).

The weight progressions in Gill Sans <strong>are</strong> ludicrous, and in a (yet unpublished) piece called 'Eric Gill got it wrong' I've written a critique of how self-contradictory Gill was in the context of the sans' weights and the 'Essay on Typography'. 

To respond to your initial point, I can still remember being hauled out during a class critique many, many years ago, for using overgenerous word spacing; therefore I completely support the word spacing arrangement in Freight Sans and see no problem with it. I also sympathise with some of what is said in the chapter called "The school of close spacing" in <a/href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0712306935?v=glance">Ari Rafaeli's 'Book Typography'.</a>

Other pet peeves? Most of them have already been listed, like the wonky italics in Caslon, but most of all, my peeve would be about the complete lack of balance or grace in the lowercase of <a/href="http://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1109747452/E1829097339/index.html">Rotis.</a> It makes no difference if one is talking about the sans or the serif or the semi of either – the fault is in the construction. The 'e' and 'c' look like they are falling over backwards.

At the Spiekerblog they are talking about it looking OK as signage – but here in Auckland it is the corporate face of the town council and used for a lot of the municipal signage. It looks plain awful in every application.</div>

I'd love to see a beautiful sans serif version of Symbol, or really any good solution for typesetting mathematics with a sans.

Typically, I use Frutiger with MathType, but it just isn't that pretty. And with Greek characters, etc., I end up having to import from MyriadPro Italic.

Any suggestions?

		<div class="commentbody">Michael:
You asked: `... really any good solution for typesetting mathematics with a sans.'

Math typesetting with a sans is quite unusual (at least in print --- about the only time I see it is in slide presentations). Some reasons for this were discussed in Johannes Küster's  presentation on `Fonts for Mathematics' at ATypI 2004. A pdf of that (excellent) presentation is available at:

 http://www.typoma.com/publ/20041002-atypi.pdf 

The only two (complete) math sans fonts that I know of are 
* HV math (a sans `inspired by Helvetica'), and
* Computer Modern Bright (designed by Walter Schmidt),
both marketed by MicroPress: 

http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts.htm

Both of these come with LaTeX support; I have no idea how difficult it would be for you to use them in MathType (but at least they have a complete AMS symbol set, which should be adequate for almost all math typesetting).

		<div class="commentbody">Michael, your pet peeve is a daily aggravation for me. I do a lot of intensive math and engineering typesetting, and we're forced to pull characters from about a dozen different fonts to set everything we need. Rarely do any of the special characters mix well with the text fonts (in terms of style, size, or spacing), which have almost none of the math characters we regularly use.

Technical stuff presents specific problems that have caused us to switch typefaces over exactly the kind of details everyone is talking about here, since characters so often appear in formulas or by themselves, rather than within normal words. If the lowercase l looks too much like the uppercase I or the numeral 1, a typeface will never work for most of what we publish. Or if the lowercase x looks too much like the times sign, etc.

So many headaches...</div>

I almost think that an effective software solution for mathematical typesetting has to go hand-in-hand with new OpenType fonts that cover tons of bases. The MathType-esque software is useless without good, homogeneous font families and the fonts are useless without the right software.

Whatever you do, please hit the ball out of the park. :-)

But then I think Michael knew, with the original post, that one man's peeve is another man's perk (or indeed, that one man's perve is another man's pique!) – which is why he framed the question that way. 

But then if you're picking holes in Meta you'd probably also claim that its punctuation is much too big...

As for <em>could you take a moment to walk us through just how to adjust wordspacing?</em> 

I was trying to figure out how old a version of InDesign Michael must be using in order to avoid his 30 lashes for H&J laziness: the following screenshots are from InDesign CS and QX6 respectively (I haven't had the chance to look at QX7 yet but I would assume you'll find this in the same place)

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wordspace1_5443.png]


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wordspace2_4039.png]

In either case the mechanism is essentially the same and the resulting H&J can be incorporated into a specific style sheet within minutes – as Patty said 'it's a snap'.

Of course, when I have more time, I am in the habit of adjusting H&Js...indeed, it's a snap. But very often, I must confess that I simply grab a face and go.

Does that make me a hack? Perhaps. But I feel that many faces work well in text settings without custom H&Js. What does everyone else think? Should faces "require" H&J adjustments? Do most faces require them anyway, regardless of whether they should?

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry to keep raggin' on the "Q" in Thesis, but I completely agree. There should be an alternate, I also am not a big fan of it. But, this leads me to my typeface pet peeves.

1) Too few sans serif typefaces have "small caps." When setting copy or used to display many levels of information, this is a necessity for me. 

I use Thesis a lot of the time for this reason. Zwo and Meta are the only others with small caps I can think of off the top of my head.

2) Too many sans serif typefaces don't have true italics. The sloped roman is simply not enough when setting a large amount of body copy.

3) The number 7 in <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Meno/styles>Meno</a>, too weird, almost a deal breaker.

4) I'd like to see more experimentation in the design of serif typefaces. While there are always exceptions, there doesn't seem to be enough experimentation in the design of these faces. Classics are beautiful, don't get me wrong...but I'd like to see some more modern approaches to serifs. Stormtype, Emigre and Font Font seem to be pushing the envelope to me along with a handful of smaller foundries.

Give me a break, just look at the most used characters and make decisions based on what you really see not imagined. I bet if you took all the characters on this thread you would have about a 1% cap Q's and thats because it was mentioned.

		<div class="commentbody">I think Dan's right about this (and it crossed my mind to mention this at the initial rag on the Thesis Q). If it was such a problem one might have come up with a custom Q (either drawn or set as a compound character) and done a search and replace within the text to get rid of the (one or two?) dodgy Thesis Qs actually in the text.

The only time an idiosyncratic Q caused me a problem was at the beginning of my career. The job was done in Queensland, Australia so I should have thought about the incidences of Qs in the text <strong>beforehand,</strong> but in my naïvety I went ahead and set the whole thing in Bookman. Now there's an ugly Q...

But it turns out I was the only person who had a problem with it at the time. It still makes me shudder to see it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Designers sometimes (alright, all to often!) try to make them different and quirky for the sake of doing so. It's better to make something good than to make something original. Just browse around Dutch Type Library's and Enschedé's offerings. It's occurred to me more than once that DTL Documenta and Documenta Sans is the only font family I'll ever need. A bit daft, I know, but no one ever got fired for using Documenta.

Take Dederon Serif. It's *actually* advertised as a Book font. Are they serious?

Ludwig Übele's Mokka is another example. Lately it's become fashionable for some reason to shape the top-most serif of the letter "a" into a sharp, downward-pointing beak. The reasons for this escape me, although it seems like an artful attempt at style. It doesn't aid reading, nor does it make text look good. Skolar seems to suffer from the same non-psittacine beak disease. Another example of what appears to be artfulness for its own sake is the bowl of the letter "a" in Mokka.</div>

It’s always the same principle. Effective and, in the majority of cases, quite ugly. I think that in Gill Sans, it doesn’t look all that bad.

For instance, I had heard once from a Dane that the preferred form of Å is merged.

When designing Whitman Display, I was directed by FB to have the ring merge with the A. (Whitman text, on the other hand, has the two separated.) I didn't argue because I could find no definitive answer. </div>

I asked several people at work today (two journalists, three editors and one typographer). Five of them thought the merged versions looked odd or ugly (I showed them Benton Sans and Nobel), while one of the editors thought the Nobel "Å" looked cool, but the Benton one looked weird. Neither of them had thought about this before. 

Perhaps the Danes are more open to weird "Å"s because they started using it much later than we did (1948 vs. 1917, but some Norwegian writers, among them Henrik Ibsen, used it from the 1890s on).</div>

To me, it's a lot more repelling when lowercase æ looks like a clash between a and e (example: Bembo), instead of being drawn as one, unified letter.

Now I see there is an Iowan Pro version which must have proper small caps inside the fonts. But strangely its information is incomplete both in MyFonts and in FontShop. Tries to show smcp/c2sp preview always return errors and the character set does not shows small caps (http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/iowan_old_style_bt_pro_roman/).

Does anybody know if Iowan Pro has small caps and old style figures as an OT feature? Is this available for the whole family?

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding Freight in it's Sans and Text variants: I, inter alios, have to say that they're pretty much unusable for German. The esteemed Mr. Darden decided to not design an ß for them, but to prove instead that he knows about its ancestry, the Antiqua's ſs ligature (an assumedly younger, but still century-old variant of the Textura's and the Fraktur's ſʒ ligature which gave the ß one of its names, the Eszett). No modern ß is provided as an alternate glyph.

The other Freight family members (Big, Display, Micro) do have an ß, but for some curious reason, Micro's ß changes into ſs in its italic, so Micro falls into the unusable-for-German-unless-you-don't-plan-on-using-the-italic category.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eszett_4601.jpg]
<em>Freight has been a little overfreighted with
well-meant typographical fanciness</em>

This inconsistency alone would make the Freight family an iffy choice for German, even if the ſs ligature wasn't completely out of use. While the elderly or typographically educated may recognize the ſs as ß (and yet trip over each instance), the rest will just wonder Whatthefont this is (and/or read it as fs).

I've heard the ß being referred to as an ſs ligature, but it's more precisely a single letter that evolved from the ſs ligature. Freight illustrates the point.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey R., thanks for the setting the record straight. I never got aware of the Pro versions after I had to axe Freight from my list years ago because of the Eszett issue. Before I wrote the above post, I did visit dardenstudio.com, but no mention of a Pro version of Freight catched my eye (there's <em>is</em> Omnes Pro), so I didn't go over the character set on the site. It seems that Freight Pro is now the only Freight there is (Phil's Fonts, though, who sell the font licenses, list the fonts expressly as Freight Pro). Anyway, good to know there now is a perfectly fine Eszett in Freight Text and Sans (and also in Micro Italic).

PS: Hmm. When I set a sample on dardenstudio.com, the Eszett situation is the same as I described in my yesterday's post, except that Freight Display shows an fl (sic) ligature instead of an Eszett. Wait a second ... most of the accents or umlauts that I'm trying with any of the fonts are more or less messed up ... looks like the font sampler thingy is to blame. Oh well, as long as the actual fonts work.</div>

That seems to be a not-entirely-uncommon encoding (?) issue (see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/4177672362/">this find</a>).

Speaking of eszetts, to many Germans Dolly has a serious German-usability issue too, because its eszett is too short (it should really reach the height of the other ascenders). I myself have only ever been able to use it in Swiss contexts, where no eszett was needed.

At first I thought it was a mistake -- matching the eszett to cap height, rather than ascenders.
But the descender is also a lot shorter than other descenders.
Perhaps if it had been designed by a German it would be more acceptable :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It looks odd within the context of the typeface, not the language.
The Souvenir "g", for instance, is odd, but not in an English-usability manner, because of glyphs like "y" which are similarly strange.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/souv_6032.png]

So in the case of Dolly, it is not a German-usability issue, other than the problem character only appearing in German text, because the glyph is clearly recognizable as eszett (unlike the Freight glyph mentioned earlier).
And the eszett character is one that adopts many different forms in the antiqua genre, so German readers shouldn't be fazed by a non-standard appearance.

I always found the f and t crossbar of Palatino and Laudatio to be unusually low.
Is that related to any German calligraphic traditions, or did I just make that assumption because I know the designers are skilled  calligraphers who incidentally hail from Germany?

What I meant is: I know a number of Germans (it's not just me) who say Dolly is essentially <em>not usable for German-language text</em>, because the eszett glyph does not work. And when I say does not work, I mean makes readers stumble. Sure it's recognizable when you stare at it, but it sticks out when reading, it seems «wrong». 
There is such a thing as dysfunctional glyph design.

<cite>"And the eszett character is one that adopts many different forms in the antiqua genre, so German readers shouldn't be fazed by a non-standard appearance"</cite>
Well that's really a little too easy.
Lowercase "g"s can adopt a number of different forms too, but that doesn't give you a wild card to do any odd thing you like, especially not if you expect people to actually read it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My primary recollection of what I've said previously on the "some-stencil" issue is that I prefer the bowl to be closed when I make a P. I love a good Baskerville as much as the next good shepherd and no blanket should be laid over the issue of topology until one is dead, I think. 

Little white spaces in metal type "scaled" exactly the way the type designer wanted them too, (at a different rate than big white spaces), and thus are resolved for the user. Little white spaces in digital type (for most users), scale out of the type designer's control, making some-stencil a non-trivial issue to resolve. If a type is only for display, it matters less, stencil away, drive a Ford over it, use XP. 

But I don't think some-stencil g's are rare because they're harder to make, so much as they are harder to use well. That little inlet at the bottom should NOT sparkle. Stencils broaden at small sizes to appear as a white counterpoint to, e.g. a serif... narrow as the size increases to remain well integrated to the eye. 

The harder that is made by technology, the fewer of these, Didots, grass scripts and other extremely humanistic typographic elements we'll see in a culture going fast forward, I think. But rejoice, we have a full alternate explanation of the g-ness of the species coming soon.

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, yes! The new Dolly is a lot better in other respects too. I always thought it was a tiny bit too soft and cuddly, now it looks subtly tightened up and more grown-up all over. Very good job! 

I'm looking forward to having similar feedback. It would be great if someone speaking Livonian or Northern Sami or Azerbaijani (or German, for that matter) had opinions on my attempts. A type designer that ignores (valid) criticism from users has no future.
