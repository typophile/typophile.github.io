  [[www.kickstarter.com/projects/chouinard/the-ink-dial/|my printing-related Kickstarter]]
  a look-see. (You can also find it inkdial.com as well.)\r\n \r\nI\u2019m not sure
  what any typographers would do with a tool to measure printing ink, but I think
  the rewards are particularly interesting. Perhaps some of you are friends, fans,
  colleagues, even collectors of the amazing artists who\u2019ve graciously donated
  work for me to print in limited editions for kickback. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of whom,
  check out some of the amazing artists who\u2019ll be making prints:\r\n\r\n1. [[http://www.bantjes.com/|Marian

  pledge, I would tremendously appreciate it if you could simply help get the word
  out. Every little bit of exposure by any ounce of effort will make a difference.\r\n
  \r\nThank you from the bottom of my ink encrusted heart.\r\n\r\nTerry\r\n\r\n"
