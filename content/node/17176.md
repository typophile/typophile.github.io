  across town to meet the right people?"

  body: "Hello Sebastien,\r\nIt's very close to the Central Station. Just leave the
    building through the main entrance (taxi side), walk to the road and go left.
    Over the bridge you have to go right and you see KABK on the left. TypeMedia is
    in that building, but I don't know exactly where. I followed the course (2001-2002)
    but they change rooms about every year.\r\nPieter"
