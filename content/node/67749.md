  Certain letters always throw me off such as \"T\" \"X\" \"W\" \"Y\"\r\n\r\nI came
  across an interesting article that talks about kerning ... http://www.wired.com/underwire/2007/04/the_math_behind/
  ... \"The Law of Optical Volumes states that the area between any two letters in
  a word must be of equal measure throughout the word, and remain consistent throughout
  the body of text.\"  \r\n\r\nWhile I understand this concept, certain letter combinations
  make this impossible ... for example \"TT\" and \"XT\" are inevitably going to have
  more negative space in between them than letter pairs such as \"MM\" or \"OO\".
  \ \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or advice?  Or examples of how these letters
  are dealt with properly?\r\n\r\nThanks in adv for any insight.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Jos for your response! I think that makes sense. So would you say
    that for any font set at a specific size there is an optimal spacing? Is that
    dictated by something like the furthest space between any two letters or is it
    just a matter of at what spacing is the most legible?\r\n\r\nI have always been
    under the impression that spacing is more a matter of taste ... or the look and
    feel you are trying to convey?\r\n\r\nCan I ask you your opinion on the spacing
    of this example?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-4_4633.jpg]"

    that the only thing dictating the level of spacing should be your eyes (with your
    mind set on the intended use of course).\r\n\r\nYour sample looks OK to me, but
    you could try giving M|E, H|E & N|E a little more breathing room."

    Every font design has it's optimal spacing. Your job as the type designer is to
    find it. Keep in mind that spacing takes much more time than drawing. There you
    go, have at it.

    three glyphs in sequence. Your job is to center the middle one between the other
    two. Piece of cake really.

    is the glyph being kerned. \r\nWith this string, I can see HH, OO, the letter
    itself with all others and with 1 \"unkernable\" pair like LA, so as not to ever
    over-kern, which see as worse than under-kerning.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    I had a copy of that taped on top of my screen for a year. After learning that,
    kerning was so much easier.

  body: "The eye really is the final arbiter with kerning. Visual, textural evenness
    is the goal. A pair that looks loose at -40 units might suddenly look tight at
    -50 units. Once you've tried various values, you can see how finely balanced certain
    pairs have to be, such as with ty or BT. Others, in the same typeface, are not
    as fussy. The \"law\" quoted in the Wired article sounds to me like a hopeful
    attempt to quantify something that can barely be measured, best done by eye. I
    don't bother much with logical, numerical or seemingly systematic kerning methods.\r\n\r\nNot
    only does everyone have their way.... I am of differing minds on kerning depending
    on the day. I have to look at all the kerning at various sizes, because what looks
    right at 100 point onscreen may look all wrong at 18 point on paper. So even among
    all the \"voices in your head\", you may not have agreement. ;)\r\n\r\nGiven this,
    it's also true that when finally kerned, a typeface, however fussed over and perfected,
    is going to displease some. Plenty of typographers and graphic designers expect
    to re-kern headlines set in expertly-designed typefaces. Taste is a significant
    factor. \r\n\r\nBeyond this, there are plenty of fonts available that have no
    kerning, inexpert kerning, or kerning geared to a particular size. \r\n\r\nPatty,
    you seem to be on your way; the second pass at kerning your headline, following
    these excellent suggestions, looks quite improved to me. \r\n\r\nOne of the nicest
    compliments I've had was that a very exacting typographer I know had switched
    from Univers to Mundo Sans for all his basic identity work, and confessed that
    it refreshed him to be able to use it without modification, \"out-of-the-box\".
    He is a die-hard minimalist, so very little stands between the viewer and the
    naked type. I would expect him to notice real problems. "

  body: "I had thought that the G had too much space around it in the initial example,
    and now the NE pair has too much too. But the real problem is perhaps that combinations
    like EXT and ET, while they can be somewhat closer than ME and NE, really don't
    need to be that much closer.\r\n\r\nAs you've noted, you can't make the empty
    area in a combination like TT equal that of NE, at least not without making the
    space in NE ridiculously wide. Right now, it's glaringly obvious that kerning
    is taking place.\r\n\r\nInstead, the idea is for kerning to be present in combinations
    like LY or LT, where the lack of kerning creates lots of extra space for no good
    reason. The space between the two letters in TT and NE - not the area, but the
    closest distance between parts of the two letters - should be optically equal.\r\n\r\nThat
    doesn't mean what you're doing, in putting TT closer together than NE, is wrong.
    A small narrow area doesn't call attention to its narrowness like a long one.
    But I would be in favor of that sort of kerning being subtle, not blatant. Because
    kerning is supposed to be invisible - it just compensates for the fact that the
    lack of kerning, due to the nature of letter shapes, is visibly obtrusive."
