  body: If you just need to describe it I'd suggest "condensed Western slab serif."
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/playbill/|Playbill]] is probably the best known
    vesion of the style but it's not an exact match.

  body: The style, in general, is known as French Clarendon, and made its appearance
    in the United States after the American Civil War. This particular iteration,
    because it is extra condensed, was usually referred to as "Belgian."

  body: thanks you guys. Now I'm going to sound like a real Beavis, because I guess
    that's the whole reason I was kind of up in the air about it... I wasn't sure
    if it was correctly called Playbill or Clarendon. Now I'm kinda still not sure
    what I should call it. I want to get it right because I'm about to send it to
    eBay.

  body: thanks again, oldnick. you were a help to me when I joined this board about
    a month ago, for the same reason. I have a HUGE collection of older type I stumbled
    into, and I'm going to need more help in the weeks to come. I REALLLY appreciate
    both of you guys for responding; I'm feeding myself by selling small lots of letters
    while I try to reassemble some of these old fonts, which I think are absolute
    historical treasures. When I get contacted by eBay "experts" they usually are
    just trying to steal the type off of me. It's nice to have this place to get some
    unbiased help. I'm not really a "typophile" so much as I am a person who just
    seems to have been surrounded by type, for one reason or vocation or another,
    for most of my life. Let's just say I'm an appreciative student. Much help to
    me, and if you want you can prolly search eBay for "French Clarendon" and find
    the listing. Thanks again, guys.
