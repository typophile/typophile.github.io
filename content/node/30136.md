  body: "I think people think it's easy because it \"looks kinda familiar\" but I
    can't tell you how many times I've pored thru type catalogs looking for that \"familiar\"
    font and still not found it. Or found it only to have someone else beat me to
    the ID. Or paged thru myfonts with some vague idea of what keyword might unlock
    the mystery.\r\n\r\n(and I should add... I wrote this before I read this: <cite>I
    guess I thought it\u2019d be an easy one cause the font looks familiar to me but
    it isn\u2019t. :D</cite> in another thread)"

  body: "Hi Typophiles!\r\n\r\nI guess someone once said (I don't know who): \"If
    it was an easy job, anyone could do it\" (or something like that) I agree with
    you guys, I know for sure that looks easy to identify a certain font, but it isn't...
    that's why I come to you in the first place, I also consider myself as an obsessive
    Font Freak... you make my life so much easier, and that's why I'm so thankful
    that I found you (no sentimentalism attached ok?) he he he!!\r\n\r\nI didn't log
    on for a while, so I used Frutiger to make the deadline, but I'm glad to see that
    you found the original font source, I'll be useful for future aplications of this
    particular project...\r\n\r\nThanks! (I 'm going to post another Font ID by the
    way)\r\n\r\nQ\u2122 Says: It's all about the Fonts!"
