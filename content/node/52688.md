  \ What typefaces are being used here?  The top looks kind of like Wichita, but isn't.
  \ The lower face looks kind of like Flash, but isn't.  \r\n\r\nI realize that both
  may very well have been one-off scripts done by the graphics person for this particular
  show, but I thought I'd ask anyway on the off chance that they're not."

    is a bit messier than the text at the top, but it's not a terrible match. My guess
    is that it's custom lettering, but others can probably recommend type that comes
    close.
