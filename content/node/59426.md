body: "In my OT output I have my ligatures working nicely and my small caps going
  as well, but when I select text with a ligature in it (in InDesign or Illustrator
  for example) and change it to small caps, the ligature stays in lower case (there
  is no small caps equivalent) - it won't clear out to be just small caps. I can correct
  this by turning off the ligatures function, but other fonts I've compared to don't
  do this and I'm not sure how to tell mine not to as well.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael"

    ups before your ligature look ups.
