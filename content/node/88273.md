  body: "There are a bunch of Clarendons -- it's as much a style/classification as
    it is the name of a specific font. In addition to the many typefaces with Clarendon
    in their name, you might consider these, which follow the same model with varying
    degrees of fidelity:\r\n\r\nSentinel\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100034\r\n\r\nSutro\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/sutro/\r\n\r\nOxtail\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/macrhino/oxtail/\r\n\r\n"
