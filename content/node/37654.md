  to the characters, but if anyone's got a similar font to this I'd be most grateful!
  It needs the funky twist to the letters, like the big drop endings to the cap serifs,
  so the simple black-poster fonts I've been trying (Fenice, Bodoni, Didot etc) won't
  cut it I'm afraid.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ultra-fat_3544.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nUntil a few months ago, there was a ladies' strip club
    in the remnants of Boston's Combat Zone called The Glass Slipper which used Stilla
    on its outside sign.  I wish I'd taken a picture of it, because it seemed so very
    appropriate to the venue...  The building it was in, got demolished and they moved
    across the street; now the sign is done in Zapfino, ALL CAPS!  =:-o\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn
    the Fontaholic\r\n(who never stepped inside the place, just observed its typography
    from the outside!)"
