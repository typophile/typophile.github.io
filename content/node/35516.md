  body: Very nice! Much easier to use now. I'd still like it if there were a master
    alphabetical list of all the books so that not knowing the category a book fits
    into doesn't make it difficult to find what you're looking for.

  body: "Hmmm, Good idea! I will look into that. If it happens - it will not be quick.
    There is some other under the hood work we are doing... and that had better happen
    first! And we need to gert the images all in.\r\n\r\nOther comments welcome!"
