  body: "Thanks a lot... that's an old font that's on my hard drive, but wasn't in
    my FontAgent library.\r\n\r\nThe \"odd\" mangling is my fault, I whipped it up
    quickly in AI by tracing over a video grab that was VERRRY low rez - I thought
    WhatTheFont might ID it, but it didn't work.\r\n\r\nFYI, this is from the appliqu\xE9

  body: WhatTheFont will only work for commercial fonts in the MyFonts library. There
    are many free and commercial fonts that won't get ID'ed by that fine machine.
    You came to the right place as a backup.
