  software but not in MS Word. Anyone know why? I have been trying to figure this
  out for a few days with no success. Best I have found is how to turn Kerning on
  and off in Word, but turning this option on has no effect.\r\n\r\nAny advice is
  appreciated. Thank you."

    what I wrote in case it's different from how you've been turning kerning on and
    off.\r\n\r\nKerning is, remarkably, off in Word by default. Under the font menu
    (typically Ctrl-D), click on character spacing, then check the box for kerning
    and type in a minimal point size at which kerning appears (1 pt seems to be the
    smallest)."

    kerning I have built still does not work after turning the option on. I even did
    a very exaggerated kern to make it obvious and it didn\u2019t show up in Word
    at all.\r\n\r\nThanks for you time all the same."

  body: Oh yeah, sorry Fontgrube, I am running on OS X. Yeah I have done the re-launch
    after install each time I tried a new version of the .ttf. No luck there. I figure
    I might be missing something in my Font Info or in the font exporting options.
    I am not sure.

    shortcut that Reid mentioned. And my font is displaying proper kerning.\r\nI don't
    know if it makes a difference but my font contains relatively few kerning pairs.
    I built them by creating a single kerning class for all the lowercase letters
    that don't have an ascender, and then I \"tucked them under F, P, T and Y with
    different values for each capital.\r\n\r\nHowever my Kerning sub-panel in the
    Options menu looks like this\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fullscreen
    capture 1282010 124434 AM_4087.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have an 'Export old-style
    non-OpenType \"kern\" table' checkbox. (I'm using Font Lab 5.0.0)"

    to share with you guys.\r\nJust to remind: the problem is that MS Word 2003 and
    2007 refuses to show kerning defined in plain 'kern' table in TTFs even if you
    turn kerning on in the Character Spacing dialog.\r\nThis only happens if you have
    at least one kerning pair defined for a glyph without a Unicode index. MS Word
    ignores the whole 'kern' table in this case.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"
