When I was in high school I made some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pretty lame rip-off fonts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I don't have anything against commercial fonts.  But I think everyone can agree that there's a pretty huge portion of computer users (let's say 99%) who will simply never buy a single commercial typeface.  So, the way I see it, we can either see terrible fonts used all over the web for the rest of our lives, or clue those people into some good ones. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the Google ads, yeah there's some crappy stuff on there.  I would prefer to set up advertising with individual foundries or something along those lines.  But if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was trying to sell fonts, I doubt I would spend my money advertising on a free font blog. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, I don't think commercial designers should feel threatened by a site like mine.

Well, if everybody's sending jobs out of the country, I guess that will make it OK. Television writing? I thought reality TV had replaced that.

That's not very supportive of commercial foundries! The theory that better free product will lead freeloaders to upgrade into the commercial market is total bunk. I await Fontleech testimonials from freeloaders who have seen the light. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;a much better strategy than whining is making fonts that other people are unlikely to make &amp; give away. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not whining. I'm responding to this post, and several participants who state that free fonts are A-OK and that quality free fonts should be encouraged, by identifying my enemies. I use that term metaphorically, of course. To be less controversial, perhaps I should say they are business adversaries, because their actions undermine my business. I'm not going to just suck it up and meekly cater to my little niche market. I never raise this issue out of the blue. If somebody hypes free fonts on Typophile, be it from Fontleech or in Adobe CS bundles, I'm inclined to speak out against them.</div>

What do they actually use them for? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've bought a lot of fonts and I have a lot of free fonts. I'm mainly interested in historical renditions (mainly as specimens) and I think the free font folk have been much more adventurous in this area. I do think that some of the more serious of the free font movement folk have long ventured into areas that the commercial world would not. The commercial folk seem vicim to a provable market and that market seems continually based on trend and fashion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've never used a free font in production because, quite frankly, they don't function very well technically. Not that a lot of commercial fonts do either but one does learn after a while who you can trust. And if you buy a font you damn well better consider it a tool rather than just another pretty face if you want your money's worth. As Lewis Allen said about metal typefaces, &quot;select carefully, for inferior tools corrode the spirit.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would think the commercial font folks would be paying close attention to the members of Typophile since they are likely the only significant font buyers around.

		<div class="commentbody">Although I can understand Nick's disagreement with the practice of bundling fonts with applications,* I don't agree with it. What I have trouble understanding is his distaste of the continued sale of fonts from deceased designers, or of new revivals of old styles. I just don't get it. If I try to sell someone a Baskerville revival instead of a totally new font by a living designer, what is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrong<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with that? Sometimes, the big foundry Baskerville is just the right font for the job. Sometimes, something new and contemporary is. Plurality is better than the alternative. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick, I hope that designers will still be using your fonts in 100 years! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*Bundling does not always equal bundling, either. When Adobe bundles their own fonts, which were designed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Adobe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Adobe, with their own applications, I don't see how that is hurting the business. When Adobe does that, what they are doing is practicing the business <!-- raw HTML omitted -->well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Adobe's fonts are part of what made the company what it is today.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;But, yeah, I definitely take Nick's comments with a grain of salt. It's kind of like HBO blaming PBS for flooding the market with free programming. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not really. Cute to compare yourself with PBS, rather than some other, commercial channel which comes &quot;free&quot; with basic TV service. Whether basic or pay-per-view, the norm is that content is paid for by subscribers. (It may also be subsidized by advertisers, volunteers, fundraising, or government). The staff of public service TV stations are paid for their work, and the stations pay a fee to movie &amp; TV producers/distibutors to broadcast their movies/programs.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I believe most of those who frequent Fontleech are not font buyers. The font market isn't losing sales when these people surf Fontleech. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These are two different points. There is a distinction between individual behavior and mass markets. Sure, any given freeloader may not be a buyer, but it's absurd to say that the widespread availabilty of free fonts doesn't impact the market for font sales.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;people that really care about good design are going to be willing to purchase quality commercial fonts despite the presence of free fonts on the web. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have no idea what you mean by good design or quality fonts. These are meaningless, subjective terms. This discussion is about hard cash: either a font is paid for, or it is not. I don't see why my business is expected to restrict itself to a niche market of elite typographers who really, really care about &quot;good&quot; design and &quot;quality&quot; fonts, while the vast majority of computer users have their font requirements provided for at no charge by those who don't need to make money from fonts.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As an independent designer of original typefaces, the behavior I am up against is: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-piracy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-free fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-bundled fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-legacy fonts  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If people are using pirated, free, bundled, or legacy fonts, they are less likely to buy my wares. This has nothing to do with how &quot;good&quot; the fonts are. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The larger issue is that all these practices represent a commodification of design, where the main criterion is The Cheaper The Better.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Marlene J. Horne puts it in her recent report on the struggling UK design industry: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Design has become a 'commodity'. Agencies are competing purely on price rather than on expertise &amp; market sector experience especially in the 0-5 [company size] bracket. This is upheld by results which show that the 0-5 share of turnover has decreased even though in terms of percentage they make up the larger part of the industry.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.icograda.org/web/feature-past-single.shtml?pfl=feature-single-2.param&amp;amp;op2.rf1=209">http://www.icograda.org/web/feature-past-single.shtml?pfl=feature-single-2.param&amp;amp;op2.rf1=209</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's not a good idea to encourage the perception that any part of the design industry, such as font design, can be good and free, which is what you are doing Stephen, by supporting Fontleech. Didn't the name tip you off that it was a bit dodgy ;-?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;The cause is lost because design is becoming a commodity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I once did a very interesting interview with Aaron Feuerstein, the owner of Malden Mills, which produces Polartec fleece. He is famous as a model of an ethical boss.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I asked him why he didn't flee New England when everyone else was moving their factories to get cheap labor, he said this (paraphrasing):  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;I never wanted to  produce commodity goods, because I would then have to compete just on price.

		<div class="commentbody">For most of type's history it was near impossible for just anyone to get a typeface to the market. Those who controlled the technology controlled the selection of typeface designs. This continued into the digital era but the change begain with Adobe's unlicensed PostScript Type 3 format.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When Adobe unlicensed its PostScript Type 1 format it was not because they were nice folk but rather it was a move to squash the competitions' proprietary formats. Through the use of software programing that took advantage of these unrestricted formats, such as Fontographer, anyone could start making fonts. By piggybacking on the formats some folks were even able to start profit making companies, such as Emigre. Only a few years prior this would have been near impossible. The beginning of free fonts coincides with this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would think that any indy foundry would have walked into this with full knowledge of the situation and eyes wide open. To hear complaints from these folks about the economic environment they operate in is almost pathetic. When passed pie, take pie, but don't complain about it afterward. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I thought the OpenType format was actually an attempt to rectify the situation in that is is far more complicated to make an OT font than a TT or PS1 font. The vast majority of the free font stuff that is lingering around is early to mid 90s in creation. With the exception of the output of the die hard free font movement folks there are less and less free fonts coming onto the scene. This also has to do with the fact that tastes have changed. The grunge movement is dead. It is much harder to produce a face of classic letterform proportions than to just pop off.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With FontLab's capability to create OT fonts we certainly will not see the end of the free font era (though it is a tad more expensive than FOG was), but I suspect in the next go around or two we might. I would think that it is in the best interests of those who actually supply the technology to do so.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For the record, I'm doing OK with the foundry, though not as well as when I was an art director. Those were my peak earning years (early 40s), so that might have something to do with it. But as Mark and Gerald have said, it's amazing even to be able to make any kind of a living designing type, which is something many of the greats couldn't do. Reason enough to be humble, as Hrant requested. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I enjoy being in business for myself, so yeah, the market is endlessly engaging. And I'm not bitter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark, combaticus, I love your attitude, and everyone else with the live-and-let-live, and thanks for the constructive suggestions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My beef with free fonts, and Fontleech, is a social policy issue. Sorry to keep harping on this. My argument is most with Stephen Coles. That may seem crazy, because we're both &quot;typo activists&quot;. So really, we're two people heading in the same direction, with different opinions on the best way to get there. It's no big deal. Stephen, I hope this discussion helps you refine your strategies.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Usually a lurker here, but i had to register and respond to this trhread. I came across joey's site - fontleech, earlier this week and look forward to it growing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the record I publish a few independent magazines and spend between $500-$1000 a year on type. That being said I do enjoy coming across a good frrebie now and then, although they are far between. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was struck by Mr. Shinn's comments as being overtly harsh and negative. Type design is as much a hobby for many as itr is a profession. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like any professional you will have a certain clients who will buy most of your product. Period. Type sales is not a mass market. And there are plenty of people out there who try their hand at creating type to various degrees of success and offer their work for free. Good for them, and good for type. Who knows where inspiration is going to come from. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The people that know know that you get what you pay, especially with type.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a consumer of fonts I love professional founderies that offer freebies. Maybe it's human nature, but I like that they are willing to give something extra - and even intice new clients that way. It's called market capitalism.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not talking about piracy or frree rip offs of commercial fonts, those thihngs are plagues on type design - professionally and otherwise. What fontleech seems to me is someone who is generally interested adn knowledgable about type sharing his enthusiasm for it, and also provding a good resource.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to say I was unaware of District from Garage fonts, that he highlighted yesterday. I downloaded rthe free weight available from the resource he cited, and can you guess what my next purchase will be? Yes, District. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it will, wirth care, grow into a valuable resource for the type community, one that foundries and designers should work with as a marketing and news tool.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mr Donnelly, I'm not against hobbyists, nor do I deny Fontleech's right to hype free fonts. This thread is about whether its wise for commercial foundries to get into bed with a free font agency. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From the perspective of the independent foundry, it may be good business, a way to tap into a new market.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But from the perspective of the designer's role in society, it's not good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With the digitization of the graphic arts, design software has swelled the ranks of those making a living as &quot;graphic artists&quot; some 25-fold. But as Mr Davies points out, part of the deal is that for many, it's not a very good living. Too bad, some would say, let free-market Darwinism winnow the chaff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a similar issue to that of graphic designers doing speculative work as part of a sales pitch. Why work for nothing? Why give stuff away? Why make good quality free fonts easily available? In the short term, it may get some foundries some business, but in the long term it will, to some degree, impoverish the industry.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What would the type business have been like if Adobe, Microsoft and Apple didn't bundle fonts with their applications? More of a mass market. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;one that foundries and designers should work with as a marketing and news tool <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Somehow, I don't think that's what Mr Nelson had in mind when he named it after a parasite.</div>

It doesn't imply that &quot;anyone who pays for fonts is a real sucker&quot; as you suggested. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You chose to overlook something pretty important in Brian's post:  someone plans to buy some commercial fonts based on one of the freebies we pointed them towards.  If that doesn't pull the rug out from under you argument, I'm not sure what does. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But you are right about one thing:  I'm not interested in working as a marketing or news tool for commercial foundries. That's not the intention of the site.  Obviously, if a commercial foundry or  font seller is offering a nice font for free (like FontShop does every month), I will cover that. With any luck it might even result in the sale of a commercial font or two.  That seems like a no-lose situation.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure which aspect of that scenario that victimizes you.

		<div class="commentbody">Mr Shinn,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not following your logic. You talk about market forces adn then talk about the technology behind a revolution in the art of graphic design and business. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Coming from a musical background, is Pro Tools a good thing or a bad thing for the music industry? Has it allowed more real artists to make a living producing and selling there art? Yes, absolutely. Has it allowed more and more talentless hacks to flood the market with bad music. Yes. The business and the market will adjust accordingly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, a revolution in the technology of graphic design has changed everything. Fontleetch seems to ba an outgrowth of it. You can't grow forward and hold onto the old suppositions of the market and technology. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not a &quot;graphic designer&quot;, but I work with graphics enough to put together professional independent magazines. I learned in the digital era. I am 38 years old and came late to the field. When I was 19 I dated a Parsons student and was bored to tears by her discussions of serif and san serifs and type. The technology now available has brought that world to me, and I have some facility in it. Will I have your talent and dexterity in it? Probably not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I had a vision to publish amagazine and hve the tools and dedication to do it singlehandedly. The revolution in technology has allowed this.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have the utmost respect for the time, talent and dedication and sacrifice neccessariy to make a living by creating, regardless of the field, but one cannot stand onthe sidelines and tsk tsk that technology radically changes every artea of human endeavor. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am sure blacksmiths tsk tsk the loss of livelihood and craftsmenship when industrialization started. Warriors lamented the beginning of the gunpoweder era. Ceratinly we lose some things, we gain others. The fact that you put &quot;graphic artists&quot; into quotations seems to me you have an outdated notion of what a grpahic artist is - that it needs to meet certain technical reqiurements and not be judged by the end product.</div>

However, I think that on balance things like fontleech can be good for independent type designers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To me, the thing that makes fontleech rise above the banner ad-infested &quot;one billion free font&quot; sites is its emphasis on quality. Like it or not, free fonts are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> popular. The vast majority of them suck big time, which is bad in all sorts of ways. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By focussing on good fonts, fontleech has the potential to teach free font enthusiasts that quality makes a difference. Good free fonts are still very scarce, so regular visitors will undoubtedly get the message that if you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> quality, you should be prepared to pay for it. This is a very different message than you get from the trillion-font download sites. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other thing that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling about fontleech the care it takes to attribute fonts correctly. To me, that is one of the most important ethical considerations, and an area in which even the largest and most mainstream foundries could stand improvement (cough, Segoe, cough). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I finally get around to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free releases<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I will happily spam them to fontleech. I'd also love to figure out a licensing strategy that would keep them from being piled in with the rest of the crap on the scammy sites, and hopefully preserve the use and distribution of the fonts with free software. I'm not sure whether such a thing is even possible, but I'd like to try.</div>
