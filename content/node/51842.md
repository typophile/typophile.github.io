  novel Old Mans War. Thanks in advance for any help. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cosmosmagazine.com/files/imagecache/review/files/20080330_old_man's_war.jpg\r\n\r\n\"The
  stunning novel of war and survival\" has a strange letter g. The clearest example
  I could find was at Amazon. If you go to the second page (click on the white triangle)
  which shows the back jacket cover, the text is a lot easier to read and see the
  odd letter g. It is like a more vertical Cheltenham g.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0765309408/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link"
