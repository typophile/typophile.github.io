body: "I am a design student currently writting a paper on Howard Gardiner and his
  multiple intelligences theory. While information regarding this theories usage in
  academic education is abundent, information on its influence on art and design education
  is not so plentifull. \r\nHopefully this paper will build into my final year project
  in which I hope to design several booklets detailling each intelligence. I am not
  sure what audience this will be aimed at as of yet, ideally the design community.\r\nWhat
  I really need are sources containing alternative treatments of the seven intelligences
  (spatial, linguistic, musical, mathematical,  interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily
  kinesthetic, and perhaps the eight alternative, naturalistic.) Have any other designers
  attempted to visually communicate this information?\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated,\r\nsara"

    of panda bears doing stuff and you'd have to rate whether you preferred the panda
    playing guitar or the panda playing soccer, etc. That's about the only thing that
    comes to mind.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
