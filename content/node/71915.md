  body: "Not in the City now, but I am from Vienna. There is a lot of Jugendstil.
    Generally walking through not so fast and up and coming parts of the city you
    can spot shop displays which are several decades old, some true gems. I remember
    there was an exhibition once on that. A lot of Metro Stations are designed by
    Otto Wagner, where you have some Jugendstil writing in the Stations. But I really
    am not an expert. The main university library holds books dating back 400 years
    or more. I really don't know where you could get specimen. Maybe you contact the
    art universities about your inquire.\r\n\r\n"
