  a school assignment but im fresh out of ideas! The new cover should have an \"edge\"
  (meaning that it should be based on a really clever idea) but still illustrate the
  content of the book.  \r\n\r\nI'm thinking about doing something that doesn't apply
  to Tchicholds teaching at all but still illustrates it well... but I'm not sure
  if thats the right way to go. Do you guys have any suggestions (go wild!)? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    or rude. I think it would be more educational for you to start roughing out some
    ideas and let us help you with suggestions based on those. You are shortchanging
    yourself and your education by asking us to do your thinking for you. "

    me. But I don't have anyone else to brainstorm with. \r\n\r\nLike I wrote \"I\u2019m
    thinking about doing something that doesn\u2019t apply to Tchicholds teaching
    at all but still illustrates it well\". Do you think that is a good or a bad idea?"

  body: IMHO Irony in design is a delicate thing to pull-off. You could try looking
    at some of his earlier (pre-new typography) work. But even then I wonder how appropriate
    that would be. If it weren't a book of theory on typography you could do this
    more readily, however the fact that it specifically discusses what he thinks are
    ideals to be used in typography you might have to bite the bullet.

    type. Run with that...
