  of Typophile, for a better understanding of the following, it would be advisable
  if the old thread\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/ 4100\r\n\r\nwere
  accessible again. This thread, which started on June 3, 2004 with the header \"Erik
  Spiekermann's statements re Berthold\", began with Mr. Harvey Hunt's statement:\r\n\r\n\"We
  were disappointed, but not surprised, that Erik Spiekermann, a noted and respected
  type designer and author, would knowingly make false and misleading statements regarding
  Berthold in a public forum. ...\"\r\n\r\n**************************************************************\r\nI
  made a PDF file (53 pages, 900 KB) of this old thread\r\nof 3-June-2004. If you
  need this file, send me an email.\r\n**************************************************************\r\n\r\nThree
  months ago, at the beginning of 2006, I published a comprehensive German-language
  document about the self-declared legal successors to the former stock-holding corporation
  H. Berthold AG with special emphasis on three phoney outfits, namely Berthold Types
  Ltd., Berthold LLC, and Berthold Corp. All three share the same room in the same
  house in the same street in the same city, and all three have the same two \"employers\"
  and \"employees\", namely Mr. Harvey Hunt and his roommate Mrs. Melissa Hunt:\r\n\r\nsee
  http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/berthold.pdf\r\n\r\nI stated in this above document
  that since many years, the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt and also their lawyers
  promulgate the fraudulent statement \"Berthold Types Limited is the legal successor
  to H. Berthold AG\". Since the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt are known to have
  instituted innumerable frivolous lawsuits, I expected that the impostors Harvey
  and Melissa Hunt would also file a frivolous lawsuit against me. Therefore, already
  in December 2005, I sent a letter to the German lawyers of the impostors Harvey
  and Melissa Hunt, namely to the lawfirm Schwabe, Sandmair, Marx, Teipel et al. and
  requested these lawyers to cease to promulgate the fraudulent statement that Berthold
  Types Limited is the legal successor to H. Berthold AG. As expected, the lawyers
  threatened to institute legal actions against me. So, in my above document, I published
  an unsigned affidavit containing the lawyers' declaration \"Berthold Types Limited
  is the legal successor to H. Berthold AG\" to be signed by the lawyers Schwabe,
  Sandmair, Marx, Teipel et al. Since German lawyers, who sign a false affidavit,
  are punished with up to three years of imprisonment, the lawyers Schwabe, Sandmair,
  Marx, Teipel et al. and also the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt panicked. Nobody
  in the font industry (Adobe, Linotype, Monotype, etc.) ever dared to sue me on account
  of my documents about these outfits at my www.sanskritweb.net/forgers website.\r\n\r\nIn
  Germany, an imposter was recently released from prison who had served a three-year
  imprisonment due to fraudulent imposture. A similar term would be expected for the
  impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt, if they were no foreigners, because the German
  criminal police cannot prosecute foreigners."

    for posting this? Just curious...

  body: "Bert, what someone posts on their own site is their own business, and if
    they get sued because of it, that is a possible consequence they presumably acknowledge
    (Uli acknowledges it explicitly). Posting material to a public forum is a different
    matter, though, because then the owners of that forum may be sued as the publishers
    of that material. As an example, a few years ago, ATypI was sued because of a
    remark made by one member in the public archives of the member discussion list.
    ATypI hadn't written the remarks, hadn't endorsed the remarks, hadn't in fact,
    done anything other than made public the archive in which the remark appeared.\r\n\r\nIf
    Uli wants to pick fights with Berthold on his own website, that is his business,
    but he shouldn't be putting other people at risk in the process. His post is a
    deliberate taunt for Berthold to sue him, and by  publishing the post on Typophile
    he is effectively inviting Berthold to sue Typophile also. The Typophile moderators
    would be showing nothing but due diligence in deleting this thread."

    why being in the right is not good enough, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI'm not doubting
    Uli's intentions, intellect or anything\r\nlike that, but I don't want Typophile
