body: My zoom tool dissappeared and I can&#39;t for the life of me find out how to
  get it back. I&#39;m generally good at fixing stuff like that in most apps, but
  this one is eluding me. I&#39;m using FontLab for Windows 4.6. Help?

  body: this happened to me once. and i just closed my zoom toolbar to help figure
    this out and then panicked because i forgot where it was! but then i found it
    again, whew! anyway, it&#39;s kinda tricky, but there&#39;s a little button above
    your scroll bars on the right. Click on that and you should be back in business.
