  body: Wow, those are some pretty conflicting adjectives. Soft, calm, and fluffy
    could be pretty easy to find, but fluffy and elegant? Soft and grand? I'm not
    sure of anything that would fit that criteria. Was this from a creative brief
    from a client?

    came to my mind was Barmeno and FF Sari. Between both, which one is better? it
    looks the same to me."
