  body: "Not sure why you think this is a \"simple answer\", since the hand-printed
    fonts are one of the hardest things to ID. There are just too many of them. I
    checked Part 11 of my Script Font ID Guide, hoping this might be one of the more
    common faces in one of the handwritten font collections, but no luck with that.\r\n\r\nYou
    could try [[http://www.fontgarden.com/gallery/a.html|Font Garden]], which has
    many free fonts like this, but be warned that the chances of finding this exact
    font are very remote. \r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    not :) Thank you both!
