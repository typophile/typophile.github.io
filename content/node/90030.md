body: "So I'm starting to dabble in type design and have been messing around with
  the calligraphic brushes in illustrator.\r\n\r\n I've skeletoned out some letter
  forms with lines and curves. I would now like to apply a calligraphic stroke, but
  I would like the nib/tip of the calligraphic brush to be a rounded rectangle and
  not oval shaped. There doesn't seem to be an advanced options area for calligraphic
  brushes. I almost reached the affect by making the rounded rectangle shape into
  a scatter brush and reducing the spacing, but the minimum spacing is 10% (I would
  need 0%).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to create this affect? Is there any way to create
  a calligraphic brush with a custom shaped nip/tip?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nj"

    typographic letterforms are not \"expanded skeletons\".\r\nIt might be tempting
    to think of the process you're following\r\nas adequate for a beginner; I'd counter
    that it's a damaging\r\nfoundation for future development.\r\n\r\nTry to think
    of a font as a collection of black <em>and</em>\r\nwhite shapes that \"talk to
    each other\" to form words.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Now that I think about it there was an Illustrator plugin for doing this called
    LivePen. But it was Windows only, so it was pretty much irrelevant to designers
    and FontLab bought it and withdrew it from the market. Maybe you can get them
    to sell you a copy.

    I am trained in the fine arts and know the proper way to approach a project like
    such.\r\n\r\nType design is not a fine art, it's a craft, like architecture or
    furniture design.\r\n\r\nWhat fine arts training do you have that includes type
    design training? Unless you have *specifically\" studied type design (whether
    formally or not), you don't know how to approach it. This doesn't mean you shouldn't,
    or shouldn't learn. Note also that type design is not the same thing as calligraphy.\r\n\r\n>
    My current endeavor takes my down an alternate path. This font is based deeply
    in mathematics and precision,\r\n> hence it's creation in a computer program.\r\n\r\nModern
    typefaces are pretty much *all* created in computer programs. It's just that most
    type designers use dedicated type design programs to do it. Maybe half of them
    do sketches first, and about as many do not.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
