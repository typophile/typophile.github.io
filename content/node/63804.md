  alphabets and original poetry as well as demonstrations of hand engraving by the
  Center for the Lettering Arts at Mystic Blue Signs.\r\n\r\nOur table will be at
  Lazziza,  2106 Chartres Street, from about 10:00am to 6:00pm.\r\n\r\nYvette Rutledge,
  master typographer, sign painter and, you guessed it engraver, will be demonstrating
  the unbelievable art of engraving with nothing but a piece of copper and a graver.\r\n\r\nI'll
  have specimens from my archives and a slideshow on my computer of fantastic engraved
  works of type from the Harry Ransom Center, including pieces from George Bickham,
  the elder's \"Museum of Arts\" where he went wild and crazy with his art (the graver).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nolabookfair.com/\r\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/planet/mysticbluesigns/\r\nhttp://www.nancysharoncollinsstationer.com/"
