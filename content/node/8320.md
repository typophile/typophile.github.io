body: I&#39;m a student looking to use &#34;akkurat - fett&#34; &#40;example can be
  found on <a href="http://www.lineto.com" target="_blank">www.lineto.com</a>&#41;
  however I can not afford their price since its just for a school assignment and
  I&#39;m broke. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of something really similar that would
  be free or at least cheaper?  I&#39;m going to use it for a fictional swiss idustrial
  design company.  The logo I designed can be found on <a href="http://www.totre.com"
  target="_blank">www.totre.com</a> using the akkurat typeface, but the screen capture
  I used to create it isn&#39;t good enough for a high-res poster I need to make.

  body: The design approach you&#39;re using would seem to work with almost any sturdy
    grotesque. Why not use Helvetica or Arial, one of which is almost certainly included
    with the operating system on your computer?  <BR> <BR>The name of the company
    is short enough that modifying any Helv/Arial characters you found offensive wouldn&#39;t
    take very long. And then you&#39;d have a truly custom type treatment, not just
    a line of type next to a logo.
