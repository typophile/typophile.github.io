body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI know I'm going to touch on some topics which have definitely
  been written about at length here on Typophile. My intent is not to rehash any open
  threads...just point me in the right direction. \r\n\r\nI guess my question had
  its inception when I recently decided to weed out all the non-legit fonts on my
  system. I never really realized that there was a real connection between decisions
  I made when I loaded fonts onto my machine and decisions I made when deciding to
  spec a font for use. It\u2019s hard to find a value in an otherwise masterful typeface
  when you may just as easily have a handful of equally apt alternatives on hand.
  Until recently (and this is true for the majority of designers I know) choosing
  a typeface for a job meant ticking through 1500+ typefaces (most of them non-legal)
  and occasionally buying something once something goes into production and you\u2019re
  \u201Cforced to\u201D.  \r\n\r\nMy workflow has changed pretty dramatically now
  that the handful of fonts I use are ones I have researched, contemplated and purchased.
  It\u2019s also difficult at times. There\u2019s a lot of \u201Cstandards\u201D that
  I, frankly, just can\u2019t afford. There are a handful of gems in the free-font
  world and I\u2019ve also started to draw some of my own faces. \r\nDo you all have
  any sage advice in the area of starting a type collection on a shoestring budget?\r\nWhat,
  if any, great values are out there?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nchris\r\n"

    of the classic faces and revivals of the twentieth century. You won\u2019t get
    small caps or old-style figures, but otherwise they\u2019re great. Prices run
    anywhere from $50 to $500 depending on what version you buy and how many people
    are selling."

  body: Likewise, some old versions of Freehand/Macromedia Studio came bundled with
    a metric buttload of URW++ fonts, (also where I got Fontographer in the mid 1990s)
    but that would probably be a much rarer find than Corel.

  body: "I regularly weed out my font library, not for un-licensed fonts (which I
    don't have any of, thank you very much), but for cruft.\r\n\r\nIt's truly a thought
    provoking experience, going through things and asking yourself \"Do I need this?\"
    \"Do I want this?\" \"Will I ever use this, and why not?\"\r\n\r\nYou'll find
    that you can pare down your font menu significantly, without really impacting
    your ability to do your work.\r\n\r\nWhat I would do, because it is what I do,
    is if I see a font that I like, I try to visualize immediately what I would use
    it for. If not now, perhaps at a future date, but I always try to focus on actual
    use. Keeping in mind real-world use, not pie-in-the-sky wishfulness or greedy
    materialism, will really help you in adding to or paring down your font library."

  body: "<em>What, if any, great values are out there?</em>\r\n\r\nDepends on your
    work. \r\n\r\nIf you go by price per glyph, you've got to figure whether you would
    ever need all the glyphs in a big font.\r\nFor instance, if you buy a 10-member
    family of OpenType fonts with Latin Extended encoding and many features (small
    caps, OSF, etc.) for $300, is that a great value for you? Would you use all the
    weights? Would you use small caps, superior figures, fractions. etc? Do you need
    CE coverage?\r\n\r\nWould you be able to use the typeface for many years on work
    for different clients, or would it go out of fashion, or be too idiosyncratic
    (or too samey) for more than one client?\r\n\r\nBut most importantly, do you think
    it's the kind of typeface you'd be comfortable working with, that would fit your
    style and make <em>your</em> work look good, and be effective for your clients?"

  body: "If you're using Adobe Creative Suite, you should already have some professional
    OT fonts installed by default (Adobe Garamond, Minion, Caslon, Trajan, Myriad,
    Chaparral, Arno - depends on which CS version, and more). Then there are some
    nice, low-budget packages which I strongly advice:\r\n\r\nAscender Creativity
    Font Pack\r\nhttp://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/ascender-creativity-font-pack.aspx\r\nYou
    should get this even only for Today Sans, one of the best digital sans serif ever
    made - it truly shines.\r\n\r\nAdobe Type Basics OpenType Edition\r\nhttp://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1902\r\nBesides
    some fonts featued in CS, here you can find a couple of Slimbach's jewels like
    Utopia and Kepler, in regular, italic, bold and bold italic, open type.\r\n\r\nI
    had the chance to buy, for a very small price, old font collections from Corel
    Draw (Bitstream) and Deneba Canvas (URW Library): both contains hundreds of fonts
    from the early digital era, with limited glyphs and functions, but they work fine
    (Deneba offers them in TT and PS format) and you can find some great stuff too
    (like Monotype Grotesque).\r\n\r\nYou could also have a look at the Softmaker
    MegaFont XXL 2.0 http://www.softmaker.com/english/megafont_en.htm, a package whose
    legimity is debatable but which contains lots of true type fonts (clone?), some
    with small caps and old style figures (but no ligatures). I haven't had the opportunity
    to test these fonts in high resolution press, anyway, while I can swear on the
    funcionality of the Bitstream and URW original fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso, Elsner and
    Flake site http://www.fonts4ever.com/free_font.php offers a free Alternate Gothic,
    a nice display font. And don't forget the top quality free fonts by Jos Buivenga
    http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/\r\n\r\nThat said, holding very few fonts in one's
    system can be a limit, or a challenge. Many great typographers based their work
    in using a very limited range of typefaces. As Slimbach states in The Elements
    of Typographic Style, it's bettere to have one fully functional font than hundreds
    of crap typefaces."

    at it. \r\nI used Swift at the last firm I worked for and really fell in love
    with it. While I probably didn't realize it at the time, I think I loved it because
    it was versatile but also didn't have too much of what I didn't need. \r\n\r\nI
    suppose I'm really keeping my eye out for a \"Sale\" (do those really exist with

    have a license to use.\r\n\r\n "
