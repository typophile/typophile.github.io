  boards of canada. i don't know the font off hand but it looks like something that
  was popular in around the beginning of the 80s, though it could be made to look
  like that. thanks for your help!\r\n\r\n[[http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/c7/66/ae5512bb9da0e83dac64c010.L.jpg]]"

  body: "I think it is a Harry Obese modified, some of the characters (R, F, N, A)
    are exactly the same. I just have found digitized the <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/list?2+harry+2+23N+183+2WG+0+7NW+0\">Squeeze</a>
    version but still you can see it.\r\nThere is a sample in the Phil's Homage To
    The Alphabet catalog (p.205)."
