  body: "The small type is also Conduit. The l.c. 'g' and the U.C. 'S' and generally
    squarer counters are all Conduit signatures. <em>\"If it looks like DIN, but isn't,
    it's usually Conduit.\"</em> -- I think that was an Yves Rule.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "From fonts.com...\r\n\r\n\"Or, as Erik Spiekermann said, \u201CThe beauty
    in ITC Conduit is that it doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything that it\u2019s not.
    It may not be pretty, but it is versatile, legible and easy to work with \u2013
    a wonderfully stupid typeface.\u201D\r\n\r\nKind of a back-handed compliment?\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure who else has disparaged it, but I've always liked Conduit. I used to
    use it on my website, and had a few people (non-typophiles) comment that they
    \"liked the font...\""
