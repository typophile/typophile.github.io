body: "What started out as a set of nerdy, cryptic notes to myself is gradually evolving
  into a full-blown blog of its own. I called it \"typography/typology\", which was
  lame and boring and NOT AT ALL NECRO. Since I'm all about the darkness, you can
  now find it under its new name, <a href=\"http://www.typomancy.org/\">Typomancy</a>.
  I also gave it its own domain (it used to be stashed away as a mostly unpublicized
  subdirectory of my <a href=\"http://www.pushby.com/forrest/\">personal homepage</a>
  (despite which Stephen and Dan and Luc Devroye, among others, managed to find it).\r\n\r\nWhy
  have my own blog when there's already <a href=\"http://www.typographi.com/\">Typographica</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.typographer.org\">Typographer</a>, and this fine blog? There
  isn't an ironclad reason, but part of it is that I'm still going to use <a href=\"http://www.typomancy.org/\">Typomancy</a>
  as a place to stash my private notes to myself. Another, better reason is that I'm
  more interested in the lower-level aspects of type design, specifically dealing
  with font formats and the politics thereof. Also, it's fun to have a place to do
  my own experimentation with nameplates and site designs and the like.\r\n\r\nThe
  three of you who bookmarked the old version of the blog will probably want to update
  your links; the old blog isn't being updated, even though it'll redirect you to
  the new one. Check it out, and thanks for reading!"

    to you over e-mail, I am also busy trying to crank out a new blog. Why yet another
    blog\u2014especially when Jonathan Hoefler believes that blogging is beyond real
    men? Simlpe. TypeOff wil be in German <em>and</em> English. Pleu, it is the only
    chance for all 7 members of the typeoff collective to post their naughty thoughts
    in once place, for all see and comment upon. Lastly, there is no other Typography
    blog is Offenbach (population ca. 150,000) yet.\r\n\r\nNo girly-men allowed, though

  body: "Yes, there are no other type blogs in San Francisco, either. Errr... well,
    maybe not.\r\n\r\nAs far as content goes, I'll do my best, but you know how it
    is. Having an actual life, getting work done, and maybe... designing some type
    are all going to conspire to keep me from Hrant-style levels of production. I
    don't know how he does it."
