  body: "Hi Morten,\r\n\r\nAppararently Robofab is not correctly installed. :(\r\n\r\nCheck
    if there\u2019s a Robofab folder in /Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/\r\nIn the
    same folder there should be file called \"RoboFab.pth\" as well.\r\n\r\nIf they
    are not there, run the latest version of the RF installer again and make sure
    you are logged in as an administrator.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

  body: "My colleague's system: iMac 10,1, system MAC OS X version 10.6.7, but I don't
    think that's the problem ...\r\nBut: When he choose the menu, 'RoboFog' is not
    there \u2013 I have that option. (Please have a look at the attached screenshot).\r\nMaybe
    the problem is here??\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RoboFog_4686.jpg]"

  body: "That RoboFog folder must be pretty old since it\u2019s not part of the RoboFab
    installation for a long time anymore. So that is certainly not the origin of the
    problem.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the location of the RoboFab folder
    on my system (OS X 10.6.6):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/librarypython_5397.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    when I open the RoboFab.pth file it looks like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/robofabpth_5903.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    this is all exactly there I can imagine there\u2019s a problem with the permissions.
    Select the folder \u2018site-packages\u2019 and choose \u2018Get Info\u2019, then
    set the permissions according to this screenshot and choose \u2018apply to enclosed
    items\u2019.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/permissions_4359.png]\r\n\r\nHope
    that will do the trick..!"

  body: I am trying to install Robofab on my new iMac with Lion.  It seems certain
    library folders are not visible in this update.  What version of Robofab should
    I install and is there a good way to install it on Lion?

  body: "From the FL Beta forum:\r\n\r\n1. If you don't have it already, get the \"RoboFab
    + FontTools + DialogKit Combo\" zip here: http://robofab.com/download/index.html\r\n2.
    Unpack the zip and put it in a location where you want the files to live. For
    example /Applications/RoboFab.\r\n3. Open Terminal.\r\n4. Type \"cd \" (the space
    is required) and drag the FontTools folder to the Terminal window. This should
    give you something like \"cd /Applications/RoboFab/FontTools\". Hit return.\r\n5.
    Type \"sudo python2.5 setup.py install\". Hit return.\r\n6. A bunch of installation
    notes should appear.\r\n7. Type \"sudo python2.5 \" (the space is required) and
    drag the install.py file in the RoboFab directory to the Terminal window. Hit
    return.\r\n8. \"Robofab is now installed.\" should appear along with some other
    text.\r\n9. Type \"sudo python2.5 \" (the space is required) and drag the install.py
    file in the DialogKit directory to the Terminal window. Hit return.\r\n10. \"dialogKit
    is now installed.\" should appear along with some other text.\r\n11. Restart FontLab
    if you have it open.\r\n"
