body: "Hi Typophilers,\r\n\r\nThis is a typeface I've been working on for over 2 years
  now. I want to round it up and put it on my website which will be ready in some
  days. \r\nFor my site I'm looking for an image or styling that could go with it.
  For all my other fonts I have made designs that fit to the font. Have a look here
  at some examples (see 'related links'):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/characters/accelerator/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/characters/shell-shock/\r\n\r\nBut
  for FatBoy I can't seem to find a good image to accompany it. Is there anyone that
  has a tip for me?\r\n\r\nIf you have any other crits regarding the font, please
  shoot. \r\n\r\nThanx,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"
