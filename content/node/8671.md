  body: 'Well done, Yves! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m peeved, though: I didn&#39;t know the face,
    but it sure seemed T-26ish to me, so I looked there in what seemed to me to be
    appropriate classifications. Of course, now that you&#39;ve shown which font it
    is, I can see that they classified it as a &#34;headline&#34; font. Only...there
    is no classification &#34;headline&#34; under &#34;search by style.&#34; Their
    classification system bites. <BR> <BR>Still, knowing the face off the top of your
    head trumps looking it up, so I bow to you, sir. That, not speed, is true Hall
    of Fame material.'

    And I totally agree with you about that sorry excuse for a classification system
    that [T-26] use on their website. But I still quite like their interface. And
    a fair share of their faces.    <BR>    <BR>Actually, I&#39;ve known [T-26] to
    surface on the market back when I still worked for FontShop. I clearly remember
    what a breath of fresh air it seemed compared to the household names that populated
    the FontBook in those days. There were quite a few rubbish faces amongst them,
    but at last the grunge generation had their own type library. That&#39;s why I
    studied their catalogue avidly and got to know a few of their faces pretty well.
    Little piece of trivia: the Troubleman &#34;logotype&#34; is set in Escalido,
    a grunged-up Letter Gothic. Nothing spectacular, but it is what it is and does
    the job perfectly:    <BR>    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6349.gif"
