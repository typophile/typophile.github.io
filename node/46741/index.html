Font awareness among business people - I'm all for it. But when someone seriously tells me to change the font in my e-mail client to communicate my corporate identity to others, it begins to smell of bullshit.

I mean, if I get a mail in Arial, I don't expect that to be their corporate font. If they changed it to anything other widely installed, like say, Century Gothic, I would think "my god, is that really their corporate font?" ...

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer a generic default font for emails.

The "document" one is reading is not really a single letter, but the email application--and one is reading a succession of emails, often tracking a conversation that contains one's own mailings. So to have a variety of fonts for different people is rather like quotations from different characters in a novel being set in different fonts. Too fussy.

Email letters become complex enough in an un-designed way, with multi-coloured "chevroned" pull-quotes from previous letters being batted back and forth, and links jumping out in underlined blue.

But a corporate text font for letters that come in envelopes -- that can be nice and discreet.</div>

However, since Windows users don't usually have either font and Mac users only have Caslon pre-installed, I tend to use Times for personal emails.

At work, I use whatever the standard / default font is set on the email program, which happens to be Arial. I see no reason to try to use another font since either people don't have the ability to see other fonts and frankly could care less about what font is being used. In business emails, its content that counts.

Corporate font choice = individual font choice. Choice, is choice.
