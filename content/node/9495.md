body: i&#39;m looking for a comprehensive resource/tutorial/book on how to get fonts
  from photoshop into fontlab/fontographer/etc and would like some recommendations.
  <BR> <BR>also, what&#39;s the learning curve for fontlab for a type newbie?  i want
  my work to be professional, but i don&#39;t want to wade through piles of documentation
  for a font application that has tons of features i&#39;ll never use. <BR> <BR>thanks
  in advance for input.
