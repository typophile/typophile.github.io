body: "Here is a logotype we are working on for an architect. This client does really
  nice work, very simple and sharp but with some bits of beautiful ornament. I have
  thought of it like the photos of the opening of Mies' Barcelona Pavilinion: an iconically
  simple structure inhabited by a bunch of guys in top hats and women with fur collars.
  Hope that means something to some one out there.\r\nMy design idea therefore is
  to create a mix font - Helvetica Neue Ultra Light representing style and simplicity,
  American Typewriter representing a sort of ornament, VAG Rounded representing a
  smart but friendly attitude, and semi serifs (The Mix or Rotis Semi) representing
  technological ornament. Sounds like a lot, right?\r\nThe actual aprocess has been
  to modify Hel to create this mix, taking selective cues from each of the previous.\r\nSo,
  just looking for general comment and tips to refine this. I am confident in the
  design and really like it generally. \r\nPlease be aware that I love Helvetica,
  tight letterspacing, Swiss-style simplicty and all those other things that you might
  hate! Our client shares my general design disposition.\r\nThis is my first post,
  so thanks for taking it easy on me!"

  body: "I like what you've done with the b, a, h & t, but I'm not too sure about
    the dots & kerning. I'd try to make a version with more square-ish dots & more
    space inbetween the letters (\"higher\" kerning?).\r\nIs the t-tail the same width
    as the a-tail (it seems thinner)?\r\nOh, and I still have a thing for Helvetica
    (not to mention Rotis Semi Serif) as well ;-)"

    spacing, kerning is more the space between certain characters\r\nsuch as 'To,
    Ta, Tc' etc."

  body: Both actually. In general I think it would look better if more "open", but
    some letters might need some extra adjustments (especially "it"). That however
    could already be resolved by adding extra space.
