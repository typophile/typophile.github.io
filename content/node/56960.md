  is? I guess it could be hand-lettered, but I'm pretty sure it's a font.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I think you're right that it's a font, because they use the lettering for
    more than just the movie title (at least on the Disney movie web site), but I
    think we have seen that Disney often adapts existing designs into new custom fonts.
    I don't think this is a commercial font that is available.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
