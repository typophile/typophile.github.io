  body: This should be possible. But it may take you some time to study both the ttx
    format and the volt project file format and then write a tool that does the conversion.

  body: "It is not a question of goodness. You are talking about a considerable amount
    of work. And your question actually is: Could anybody please do my work? Short
    answer is: No.\r\n\r\nObviously Microsoft did not find it useful to import OT
    fonts' layout tables back into VOLT so they did not add an according function.\r\nIf
    you plan to add more features to your own fonts, you should still have the original
    VOLT fonts or project files, so that you can adjust these.\r\nBut if you need
    a tool tailored for your own special workflow, as is my impression, then it would
    have been more appropriate to say how much hours, days, weeks of work the tool
    would save you and thus what it is worth to you, rather than appealing to goodness."
