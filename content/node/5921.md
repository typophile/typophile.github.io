    show up as code. Could you post your images as a jpg, please.

  body: Sorry, I didn&#39;t save this correctly the first time. This is Precision
    Stone. They install stone tiles in homes. They wanted the target line to go through
    the words as if the stone was being cut. I did a second version with an abstract
    image to display precision and technology. Any advice taken - they are in a hurry
    and not paying a great deal for this. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42120.jpg"

  body: 'The second logo makes me think more of a diamond setter rather than a company
    that installs stone tile. Could you please tell us a little more about the company?
    What kind of stone do they work in? Is it rough textured stone-implyed by the
    rough edges of the word &#34;stone&#34; Is it smooth marble tiles? Both? Stones
    for floors? walls? both? rock shaped stones or cut tiles? '

  body: 'Too many things going on in the logo. Targets are not a good idea. Looks
    like a GUN company. It would be cooler if there was something a little off with
    the word PRECISION. Laying tile is not a mechanical excersise, it&#39;s done by
    hand. There are bound to be some alignment errors that happen when laying tile.
    You might try something more SHABBY SHEAK/ Earthy. Right know the logo feels too
    Concrete, not enough class and sophistication in the typography. You might also
    try a Typeface that is based on PRECISION ie Bodoni or Didot. '

  body: IMO, the word precision does not call for a bold face. The root word precise
    indicates sophisticated technology, refinement or perfection. The typeface should
    reflect that. Words that come to mind with the current selection is bold, stable,
    and obnoxious &#40;lose the scope

  body: ' The rough &#34;Stone&#34; type may appeal to lowest common demographic &#40;AKA
    American Public&#41;, But it is not attractive.  <BR>I agree, the concept of the
    &#34;target&#34; and the line reaching out at 90 degrees has been done a lot.
    I think of this as something to do with lasers or light, besides this look is
    a bit dated. <BR>I would suggest re-thinking concept. I agree with Scottt that
    &#34;Precision&#34; can/should imply quality and finess in craftmanship as well
    as mechanical/technical precision. Bold type looks bad. <BR>Consider which suits
    this client and demographic best. <BR>Consider this as well, sometimes it is possible
    to sell clients on something they do not personally like if you can explain to
    them it will benefit them financially by reachinbg their target audience. This
    is after all business and not art. <BR>If your clirent won&#39;t listen to you
    shoot him. You can always claim him pushing the target concept had something to
    do with it. '
