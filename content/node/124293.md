  mean the red font by the way!\r\n\r\nThis is an official Tolkien image, but I don't
  think that the font is just created for this picture. And this font is really awesome.
  How can I find out another font that nearly looks the same way? Is there an easy
  way.\r\n\r\nOr maybe someone knows this font, too. That would be awesome. =)"

  body: "Thanks for your ideas about the font. Meanwhile I also found another called
    Viking: http://www.dafont.com/viking.font?text=MIDDLE+EARTH&psize=s\r\n\r\nThat
    looks mostly like the one I searched for. But it's shareware, none is really free
    to use. And I'm not sure that when I buy or pay something I can use it in my non-profit
    project that will be online.\r\n\r\nCan someone bring some information or links
    where I can read more about this? Thanks\r\n\r\nPS: Viking and the Taranis font
    look very much identical, so did the Viking because it was released much later
    just copy that font?"

    and I can use it in my project? Do I get a licence in that way or how can I say
    that I really bought it?"

    but buying does not 100% making me sure that what I would like to do is allowed.\r\n\r\nI
    think I need to search for a really free alternative, since this is too risky
    for me.\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks."

    by that you mean redistribuiting the font, or embedding it in an application,
    or applying an open source license to your project, the answer is no.\r\nYou can
    perhaps find a suitable substitute here: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/calligraphic
    or http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/tag/calligraphic\r\n(where you also
    can filter by type of license).\r\nOne possibility: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Kells-SD\r\n"
