<p><img src="/images/old-images/eg1_3759.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So then last night I get an email saying could I try the following (specifically with these colours)&hellip;.</p>
<p>I ring them and ask them why the change in colour and apparently its because they looked at someone else&rsquo;s site and those were the colours they used&hellip;..they wanted fresh and modern and to me what they want looks terrible in these colours (conservative grey, too many competing elements in the logo with the colours)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m meeting with them in a few hours- and as I always say it&rsquo;s their logo at the end of the day&hellip;but can anyone else see where I am coming from??</p>
<p>TIA</p>

There&rsquo;s a black and white version&hellip;part of the problem is there are two people in the team and one of them would of just gone with first option&hellip;but the other is interior designer and keeps tweaking things..I think it looks bankish or a football team&hellip;</p>

<p>you have to be careful with yellow on grey, though one of my favourite colour combinations I have had the problem of the yellow disappearing into the grey when just squinting a little - unfortunately it was the date of the event and I wasn&rsquo;t asked to do flyers for that club again!</p>
<p>I like the softness of the type. The tail of the g however is getting a bit close to its own bowl!</p>
<p>Hope you can think of other was to push this along&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello, Maree.</p>
<p>Yes, they are insane. Sorry I&rsquo;m late.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to talk about design with a client, when they ask why you are using this colour and not the other, what&rsquo;s the difference between Helvetica and Comic Sans&hellip;</p>
<p>We must be prepared for this kind of questions. My way of telling a client that his logo is &ldquo;crap&rdquo; is by telling them that it is &ldquo;non- functional&rdquo; and asking them what they want to communicate, what values do they have as a business.</p>
<p>They might answer:
&ldquo;We are a fresh and modern company that provides design solutions to bla bla bla&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now you have to take a big breath and start telling them why their propousal isn&rsquo;t communicating what they are as a business.</p>
<p>You can start saying something like:
&ldquo;Yellow is a warm colour, in your propusal is losing power, it looks like worn out. The contrast with light grey isn&rsquo;t helping at all, it isn&rsquo;t a fresh colour.  Beside, you are adding more colours to the logo, making it more difficult to recognize. If you go for one colour it is more recognizable, it&rsquo;s easier to be positionated in the mind of the client.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may also do some research of all the competition logos that have the same colours, shapes, etc. You must convince them that the most important thing in a company is to be different from the competition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another very important point, competition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to keep writing about this subject, I really like talking to clients, it&rsquo;s a trhilling moment that defines you&hellip; But my english is quite rusty and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not making too much sense.</p>
<p>I recommend you this blog:
