  if anyone can help me, please?\r\nI am making a font and it works fine as a .otf
  but as a ttf all the letters with descenders are messed up in font size 36pt and
  below, fine in 38 and above. \r\nI've looked at the metrics til I'm going dizzy
  but can't for the life of me see what's wrong.\r\nThanks,\r\nSethan"
