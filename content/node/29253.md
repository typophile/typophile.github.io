    Doing a search on Typophile for those names will reveal a number of earlier threads
    where they (and other alts) are mentioned. '

    friends with a speeding car. Too friendly for his own good. The thread you're
    refering to was <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20879?from=50&comments_per_page=50\">this
    one</a>, which hasn't been Comma's <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27593\">only
