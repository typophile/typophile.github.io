body: "Hey all, I am currently involved in a branding project for a skatepark located
  in east Oslo. We have finally agreed on a direction with the design, but I am struggling
  with the details. Basically, the symbol is based around the idea of a monogram inside
  of a wheel-nut, with the type and the supporting pieces resembling pieces/angles
  you would find in a skatepark. The type is set in Bureau Agency, as I wanted a geometric
  and somewhat constructivist looking typeface to go with the symbol. However, I can't
  find a good way to get the two to play off each other properly. In the top example
  the hexagonal is with straight edges, and the type set straight forward. In the
  middle example, the outline of the hexagonal is rounded to resemble the type more,
  and in the bottom example the hexagonal is straight, and the type is modified to
  resemble it instead. The circle between the words is symbolizing a wheel, and the
  odd letters are symbolizing tricks/jumps and add a bit of playfulness. Any thoughts,comments
  etc.? \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\nAnders"

    on its own. '

  body: "Yeah I suppose I could lose the symbol. They really seemed to like it though,
    they talked about embroidering it on hats and t-shirts and whatnot. If I were
    to keep it, which one do you reckon works best? Thanks for your reply!\r\n"

  body: "The detail is much too fine for a logo, especially if it will be embroidered,
    or silk-screened on fabric.\r\nOr for that matter, reproduced at small size in
    pixels.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nick; do you mean that there is too much detail in the type or in the symbol?
    It will mainly be used on 500x700mm posters, stickers, possible on vinyl for some
    of the ramps in the park, as well as embroidered on caps/t-shirts (only the symbol
    though).

  body: "Maybe skaters have different graphic sensibilities in Oslo, or maybe you're
    deliberately staying away from a youth culture/action sports look. But this logo
    says \"vendor of Arts & Crafts furniture\" or \"boutique architecture firm\" to
    me.\r\n\r\nThe nut is an interesting shape, but bolder/simpler type and symbol
    would be more fitting, versatile, and more easily reproduced."

  body: Yeah the skating scene in Oslo is a bit different, not really sure how to
    explain it. And yeah, I am also deliberately staying away from the Emerica/DC/Volcom
    look and going more for the HUF/Vans look. Here are two versions; the first is
    with the same typography and a bolder symbol, the second is with a simpler typeography
    (only stroke shaded) and a bolder symbol. Any thoughts? Thanks a lot for the feedback
    so far guys! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Utkast8_4047.jpg] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Utkast9_4649.jpg]

  body: "I do quiet like your design Godal. My initial thoughts when I look at it
    are a mixture of Volcom's logo (for some reason) and a bit of Bauhaus styling?
    \r\n\r\nI would say it could work as a skate park logo, maybe try removing the
    hexagon outline though and see how that looks?"
