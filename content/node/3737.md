  body: No harsh feelings, but I see nothing in this...sorry for that. Too &#34;everyday&#34;
    face used for J &amp; M, too obvious treatment on M, and the handwriting below...I
    think the capital J &amp; M could be joined in some way in a more creative fashion.  <BR>

  body: With the handscript, are you going for the Jerry Maguire approach to design?  <BR>
    <BR>I have the most problems relating the JM mark to the &#34;Jerry Maguire&#34;
    font. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s corporate vs. everyman right now.  <BR> <BR>Unoriginal?
    I&#39;m concerned about unpersonal. It doesn&#39;t tell me anything about you.
    <BR> <BR>Keep going, <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: I too am a student, and the way I see it, a logo for myself is not a great
    idea. If you are going to have a firm or something of your own, then I would name
    it, and give it a mark of some kind. Since I see this as something for your portfolio,
    and you may be trying to show your portfolio for the purpose of getting a job,
    I would stick to a type system. Create a hierarchy of typeface, weight, size,
    etc., and carry it throughout your materials. This shows you as an individual,
    and someone who knows what is goin on. If you have a mark, it looks like you&#39;re
    a firm. <BR> <BR>whichever you are going for is fine, but I think a clear distinction
    needs to be made. <BR> <BR>And yeah, I agree that you should push it. You mention
    Swiss somethingorother, maybe look for an expressive USE of a typeface, rather
    than script. <BR> <BR>Aaron

  body: and don&#39;t use a gradient either. Try working with positive and negitive
    spaces. Right now its rather static.

  body: "Hey guys I just wanted to say thankyou for the critique over a year ago it
    actually lead me to find the TYPOGRAPHIC solution I needed. Harsh critiques spawn
    restrategizing. JII is my simple logo now, [img:sites/default/files/old-images/selfid_5599.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    reasoning for the logo.. Joseph Thomas Maguire III  JTM III  JII... \r\nI have
    a strong family line 20th most noble last name from Ireland. I am the the third,
    My last name begins with an M and first letter starts with a J. It's all of me,
    its encompassing and its simple. I found it through alot of sketching, and playing.
    and I am very happy with how it came out. You can see it in action along with
    my family coat of arms on my website at www.sisudesigns.com\r\n\r\nThanks to all
    who critiqued!\r\n\r\nJoseph Maguire III\r\nCommunications Designer\r\n"

    grandfather were/are both still living. You move up the chain as each one would
    pass on.

    too late, but I can't help it: I would have a small gap at the bottom of the two
    \"I\"s on the right - makes it more of an \"m\", without taking too much away
    from the \"III\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
