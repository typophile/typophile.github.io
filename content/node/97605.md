body: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nI am currently doing my 2nd year Masters in Communication
  Design at ESAD, Matosinhos, Portugal. One of the ideas I had for my final project
  was to develop a typeface specifically for children e-books. I am still not 100%
  sure about this, because designing a typeface for good readability and legibility
  on screen has a lot of issues. As James Felici says in his CreativePro article,
  \"The question of readability is not just an academic or aesthetic issue: Studies
  show that people read printed text 25 percent faster than on-screen text. What can
  we as typesetters do about this? Very little, as it turns out (...). The most immediate
  problem is that screen type is not sharply rendered. On a computer monitor, including
  the flat screens used by tablet computers, this is true in part because screen images
  are created using glowing pixels.\" \r\n\r\nShould I go for it, or is it a lost
  battle? Comments and advices are much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks you,\r\nRC"

    on a reflective screen is easier. The question is, are younger people using e-readers?
    I doubt it - I think they're using tablets; e-readers are generally used by adults,
    in fact older adults. Plus does a font designed for \"youth readability\" on a
    reflective screen need to be different than one on an emissive screen? I don't
    see how (except maybe in a very low-level sense, as in hinting for subpixels).
    Ergo: maybe shoot for \"youth readability\" on any medium, including print.\r\n\r\nBTW
    the* first thing you should do is look at existing efforts, such as Ann Besseman's.\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-52718.html\r\nBTW,
    she just got her PhD.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/68178950@N08/8127809451/\r\n\r\n*
    BTW, I just mistyped that \"the\" as a \"t\", and realized something: \"the\"
    should be replaced with \"t\"; as the most frequent word in English that would
    save quite a bit of room/effort.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "> screen type is not sharply rendered \r\n\r\nThat's a pretty broad statement.
    Certainly it's true in many instances, but books (especially cheaper ones and
    paperbacks) don't always have perfect printing either. \r\n\r\nThe iPad is the
    most popular tablet, and the newer ones have a very high resolution. And since
    children's books typically use a larger point size, plus children typically have
    a short attention span anyway, I don't think this is a big issue when it comes
    to children's books."

      problem of screen type: legibility. When set in sizes considered normal for
      print on paper \u2014 10- and 11-point \u2014 it can be a struggle just to decipher
      screen type. But making type larger by itself \u2014 enlarging it to, say, 12-
      or 14-point \u2014 does little to improve readability, because the low resolution
      and display techniques of computer and e-book reader screens prevent the fine
      character definition and spacing we\u2019ve become accustomed to in print over
      the years.\"\r\n\r\n"

    this experiment \u2014 hold a book next to your computer monitor, and adjust your
    browser's setting so type is roughly the same size as the book text. Is it \"a
    struggle to decipher\" what's on your monitor?\r\n\r\nResults will vary, but on
    my monitor I can still read just fine. And my iPad is much sharper still."

    sizes considered normal for print on paper \u2014 10- and 11-point \u2014 it can
    be a struggle just to decipher screen type.\"   \r\n\r\nThat is clearly a generalization
    that is not true in many cases, especially on a retina-screen iPad where type
    is sharp and clear even in fairly small sizes.  \r\n\r\nNow if he'd been a bit
    more restrained in his comments and said that footnote-sized (like 6' or 7') type
    could be \"hard to decipher\" on a monitor, I'd agree. But 10' type is easily
    readable on my notebook and iPad."
