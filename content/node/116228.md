body: This is a scan from Taschen's Type, A Visual History of Typefaces & Graphic
  Styles. It does not say about who, when, or where and I was curious if anybody knew
  anything about its history? Also does anyone know anything about a similar digital
  font that can be purchased? I haven't found anything. Any help is greatly appreciated.
  Thank you

      the creator. I was thinking to re-create the font and I wanted to include his
      name when naming the font. And thanks for the links. Figgins Tuscan looks the
      closest.\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "Hi Stefan, the designers/punch cutters of American foundries are better documented
    than their French counterparts. In a case like this I would credit the foundry
    by name and include the date of the specimen.\r\nBTW I agree Figgins Tuscan looks
    the closest and a good source of inspiration for the missing letters.\r\nDon"
