  body: Sadly Typophile  has decided to withdraw its sponsorship of this contest due
    to its hardline policy around no-spec competitions. For this reason the organizers
    have been scrambling for a new sponsor, and can officially announce that Adobe
    of Australia has stepped up to the plate. Unfortunately this means the entry fee
    has to be raised by 40 to 50%.

  body: "Clearly this is a gag from Si\u2014but since it's inexplicably sparked some
    controversy, let me clarify. Typophile never sponsored or withdrew sponsorship
    of this competition. The 2 pint entry fee, followed by the one pint award is telling;
    its clear who really benefits from such competitions.\r\n\r\n"
