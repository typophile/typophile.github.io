  the Garbo script available, can't seem to find anything matching it...\r\nAlso interested
  in the other font in the same image.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDana\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hah! I bet this is the very snapshot <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/2186292033/">I
    took</a>. I love the script too, Dana. Nearly any film titles from that period
    were drawn by hand. Like Mike suggests, have a look at Ale Paul's digitization
    of the <a href="http://sudtipos.com/home">Bleumlein scripts</a> (right column)
    which were lettering styles of the era. You might like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/comicraft/matinee_idol/">Matinee

    Stanfort</a> might be the best match stylistically but the lowercase is much smaller.
