  a fully functional arabic font with ligatures and diacratic marks and an Open Type
  library etc....\r\nWell, I just tried to enter arabic text from the \"Times New
  Roman\" font into a static text box in macromedia flash, and the characters would
  not merge(i.e. the glyph's did not automatically change to the correct contextual
  ones).\r\nAfter hours of searching, I'm assuming its hopeless, but as a last ditch
  effort, I'd like to know if there is something I can possibly do when building my
  font to make the ligatures and diacratic marks appear as I want them to in Macromedia
  Flash (rather than as separate letters, I'd like them to join together, much like
  this:\r\n \u0628\u0627 = \u0627 + \u0628\r\n\r\nwell, if anyone knows of anything
  that I can do when creating my font, I would appreciate it.\r\nthnx"

  body: "I'm no expert here, but I don't believe you have any control over which glyphs
    or OpenType features an application can/will display. For example, InDesign CS2
    is the ONLY application I know of that will recognize and implement stylistic
    sets; all other applications simply don't recognize this feature. Similarly, accessing
    non-default numbers, small caps, alternate glyphs, etc., in an OpenType font is
    all but impossible except in the most recent & specialized applications. This
    is simply a matter of the application catching up to OpenType/Unicode.\r\n\r\nMy
    guess is that MM simply didn't think Flash users were big on advanced typography,
    so didn't bother to build in the necessary glyph palette (hell, even some Adobe
    CS2 applications keep you from accessing many glyphs & features). So, it seems
    your only option is to nag MM/Adobe to improve this in the next version of Flash
    (or whatever it might be called now that Adobe has it)."

    personal insights, but it looks like this page might have some useful information:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/languages/unicode_in_flmx/\r\n\r\nSee
    also the demos on this page\r\n\r\nhttp://www.productbeta.com/tutorials/show.php?goomba=1&\r\n\r\nwhich
    demonstrate that correct Arabic is apparently possible.\r\n\r\nIf you google Flash
    Arabic you might find additional information."

  body: "Note that most basic Arabic script shaping does not involve ligatures per
    se, but applies the 'init' 'medi' and 'fina' features as appropriate based on
    analysis of the character string. The 'rlig' feature should be used for the obligatory
    \u0644\u0627 and any other ligature that you want to be on by default. On Windows,
    most applications rely on the MS Uniscribe script engine for Arabic shaping; I'm
    afraid I don't know what Flash does or how it provides cross-platform capability.
    The Uniscribe engine will automatically apply both the 'rlig' and 'liga' features
    for Arabic text."
