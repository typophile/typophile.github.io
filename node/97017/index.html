  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I think I already know the answer to this but just wanted to double check with you fine folk. :) And due to disclosures I apologise for the secretive nature of this post..

I've used two typefaces designed by a well-known foundry, for a well-known brand's new logo redesign (which will appear internationally in a fairly large public scale)..

The client is aware that they'll need to license both typefaces. Typeface 1 appears in the logotype with minimal modifications in two characters (arms/bar extended 5%, counter opened 25%, roughly). Typeface 2 appears in the logotype too of which three characters are minimally modified (bar extended to match arms, terminal altered).

(Additional info, though might be irrelevant..) Typeface 2 may also be used, unmodified, for headline use in all of the brand's comms materials (I haven't made a final decision on this yet).

Just wondering what is the rule for a situation like this? Does etiquette call for giving a courtesy notice to the foundry regarding the type modifications made for the logotype? I'd like to stress that the modifications are almost negligible.. Well at least based on rebrand projects I've done in the past, this one's pretty negligible. ;)

Sorry for the long-winded post!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The EULA doesn't mention logotype use specifically.. So okay, once my client purchases the appropriate licenses, no notification is needed to let the foundry know about the slight character modifications? Just confused because the EULA states typefaces cannot be modified.. Oh crap, just found this in the EULA..

"You agree not to make, or authorize or commission others to make, any additions, deletions or modifications to, or derivative works or fonts based on or substantially similar to, the Typefaces without the prior written consent of.."

Hm, I guess I found my answer. Crap. :(

..Or does that only apply only to the typeface as a whole? And not to an application of the typeface (if that makes sense)?

I once worked with a typographer to make a proprietary cut of DIN for a client (for their exclusive corporate use). We contacted the foundry as a courtesy and they laughed us off saying of course it's fine.. I was hoping it's the same for this foundry. :/</div>

And: What Frode said about having a bona fide type designer doing the mods.
