body: I am undertaking some research to discover if there are any relationships between
  individual letters and particular colours.  I am also interested in how combinations
  of letters relate to particular colours, in this sense I am thinking of looking
  at linguistics, and the certain combinations of letters which correspond to particular
  sounds in various languages &#40;for example &#39;ll&#39;=&#39;y&#39; in spanish&#41;,
  th eproblem is that I have only been able to find one article on the subject which
  seems very inconclusive.  Does anyone know of any thing else written on the subject?

    could search for that. &#40;Although you also seem to be mixing orthography in
    there, so the grapheme &#60;ll&#62; being used to represent [j] in Spanish wouldn&#39;t
    generally fall under phonesthetics, but more like the general trend that a high,
    front vowel is used in words for small items &#40;teeny, tiny, etc.&#41;, while
    back vowels tend to be used for larger items &#40;huge, etc.&#41;.&#41; Since
    these deal with trends, you will find much that is inconclusive. That&#39;s the
    nature of the beast. <BR> <BR>Also, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis might be of interest
    to you, but only the weak form &#40;that there is an <b>influence</b>&#41; is
    tenable,

  body: 'Ah, synesthesia. Fascinating topic. Coincidentally, I saw another reference
    to this condition today, in a Guardian TV review of a recent documentary about
    the postmortem adventure&#39;s of Einstein&#39;s brain. It has been suggested
    that Einstein may have had some degree of synesthesia, prompting the documentary
    makers to interview a couple of synesthetics: apparently the name Albert Einstein
    &#39;tastes like yoghurty wafers&#39;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve heard that some synesthetics
    experience text as colours, but I don&#39;t know of any references.'
