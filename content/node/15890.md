body: "This logo is for a music based company that is designed with artists in mind.
  It helps them get matched up with appropriate venues. The name of the company is
  \"mJambo\", which means \"hello\" in Africa, and also harks back to the roots of
  music itself. I have designed two very different styled logos. I'm leaning toward
  the first one. The client has specified that he wants the \"m\" lower cased and
  prefers just a type treatment as opposed to an icon. I'd love to hear a critique
  of the logos I have provided, as I know they need to be fine tuned.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n(please
  note I have attached all revisions made on this first post)"

  body: Do you know all the ways the logo will be used? Will it be used small, will
    it be used in Black and White, will it be used in one PMS color? If its yes to
    any of these questions then loose the gradients and make it work as a vector mark.
    Its always easier to add gradients to more complicated packaging than to dumb
    it down if you have gradients.

  body: Good suggestion. Right now they are not doing any print pieces, just the website.
    But in anticipation that they will at some point, loosing the gradient may be
    a good idea. Thanks. Any comments about the actual logo?

  body: "I like them both. I think it's good that you've gone for 2 completely different
    logos too. \r\n\r\nAlthough I do agree with Dan (above), and I'm generally not
    a fan of gradients and shadows etc, i think the reflection on the 2nd one works
    well. It'd be a shame to lose that as it finishes off the logo nicely.\r\n\r\nOne
    other thing (which you may  have allready be aware of) is that the 'J' in the
    first one isn't a capital (or doesn't look like one) as your client wanted/suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    2nd logo visually seperates as 'm Jambo' wheras the first one seems more like
    'm jam bo'. could this be a thing to consider also?\r\n\r\nCheers Leah!"

    the 'b' gives the second one a more layed back, serene feel. I tend to appreciate
    that quality in advertising in general, but I guess it depends on the intent,
    audience, etc.\r\n\r\nI agree with WhitePepper that the 'J' in the first one does
    not read as a capital though.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think you have to ask yourself who the logo is meant to comnnect with &
    what it needs to say about the company. I think both logos are quite solid. Ultimately
    the question of which one aught to be used  or if you need something else should
    be based on intent. How do you want to be seen & by who? Does either of these
    match that purpose?

  body: "Hi, Leah. I think the color variation in second version (from top) causes
    readability problems. I think the top version can work for all media with very
    few changes. For instance, you can add a hard 20% gray shadow and remove the gradient
    for black and white use, but use the gradient and the soft shadow for everything
    else.\r\n\r\n"

    on the 1st one. Also, the letters don't align quite perfectly. I wonder about
    tweaking the outlines so they do align?\r\n\r\nBringing the m&b together in the
    2nd case will give the right reading cues. I have some idea about this word should
    sound - I lived in Tanzania as a kid. Jambo or mJambo is specifically from Swahili,
    a language spoken mostly in East Africa. The 1st m should have a small stop."

  body: Leah, I wonder if the serif on both <strong>m</strong> aren't working against
    the design. I also wonder if you've tried the cross bar, which originates from
    the <strong>j</strong> can't be lowered. What if you added a little of a lead-in
    on that stroke to more emphatically make it read as a <strong>j</strong>?

  body: I like one serif the best. The others are starting to look & feel fussy to

    It's more suggestive of the swahili as it's spoken. So...I vote for one serif!
    I actually think it's ready to use.

  body: 'I suppose that yes, I do not agree with Dav,( formlos). The old J seems fine
    to me. I don''t think thge new one *bites* or anything. But If you are looking
    for a more J like J I wonder if you can find another way. The current Serif on
    the cap J points back and holds my eye. But even so, my main suggestion is still
    that you restore the serif to the right side of the the 1st m. In the case of
    the J, I wonder if a twist could be introduced instead of a serif. Or a wave in
    the line. Sort of a coca-cola wave. It could be very funk fresh. Or a shorter
    serif. It is tasty though. In spite of my ideas about how it might be better I
    think this is an interesting and strong solution. But it is easy to accept very
    good. I think you should push on to great. '
