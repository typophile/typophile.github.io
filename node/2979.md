    target="_blank"> Kiwi Media&#39;s</a> bastardization of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/galaxy/"
    target="_blank"> Galaxy</a> called <BR>Bajoran Regular. Since Kiwi Media seems
    to have disowned its largely <BR>cloned creation, you might want to look <a href="http://star-trek-fonts.fanspace.com/"
