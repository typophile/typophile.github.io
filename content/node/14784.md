    \ The problem coms when you want to use a pi font just in one spot.  You first
    have to click in the spot for insertion and then go to text>character and select
    the pi font before you look at the Glyph palette to choose the dingbat.  Yeesh,
    now I sound like a dingbat.  I just read what I wrote and wonder if it is at all
    understandable :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    the hot metal days :-)\r\n\r\nSorry my post didn't help.  I still can't think
    of a way to say it better.  It would be much easier to show you on screen. Maybe
    the Adobe guys have a kinder-gentler way to state \"the case\".\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "David,\r\n\r\nApparently, the way it works is that when you choose insertion
    point in the text or select some text, the Glyph palette (or job case, if you
    wish) switches to whatever font is before the insertion point or in the selected
    text. (If the selected text includes more than one font, it switches to no font
    at all.)\r\n\r\nSo, the trick is, choose the location first, then you can switch
    to a different font in the Glyph palette and when you double-click on a character,
    it will insert the correct character from the font you chose, even if it is a
    different font from the surrounding text.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?"

  body: "\"Does that make sense?\"\r\nNo, but thanks: The Job case/glyph window, should
    behave as though it's useful, and not some sort of extra appendage. I understand
    why is switches from font to font, according to the location of cursor in the
    text, but it makes no sense at all to move the case to the high-lighted glyph
    when that is selected because, (HEY DUMMY!) the high lighted glyph's already in
    the text! Why in the name of Ptah would I want to replace it with itself...Sometimes...I
    wonder if they use it at all, or if they're only allowed to listen to monkey's
    talking and focus group \"translators\"...:)\r\n\r\n"

    set you have selected: ''alternates to selection'', ''numerals'' ''all characters''
    etc. The highlighted character has to default somewhere, I guess; what do you
    suggest? The current highlight at least has the merit of confirming to you what
    character you will be replacing. Maybe Adobe will change it if you have a better
    idea. I find the most useful feature is the ''alternatives to selection'' choice
    of palate. This gives you a relatively small, relevant set of options.   '
