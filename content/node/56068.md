  body: "Is that from an old movie or TV show?  It's very dark, and therefore hard
    to see details well, but if this dates from before the 1980's, you are either
    looking at photo type, metal type, or hand-drawn lettering. I would check Part
    1 of the Script Font ID Guide, to see if anything seems similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I just followed my suggestion and found that [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/psyops/anglia_script_enhancements_ot/|Anglia
    Script]] from Psy/Ops is rather similar, and one of only two scripts I collected
    that had the round A style. The closest A is in the alternate characters shown
    in the character map.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Script). \r\nHowever, I would ideally like something less 'decorative', but still
    has the strong downstroke!!"

  body: "Anglia comes in several 'flavors', and one of them is quite plain and un-decorative.
    See the top three samples [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg4.html|here]].
    There are two lower case choices, both rather plain, and the Enhancements font
    gives alternate (plainer) choices for many of the initials.\r\n\r\nThe other font
    with the round A was [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg3.html|Adage
    Script]] at the bottom of the linked page. Adage Script is Jason Walcott's take
    on Adscript, an old metal script face.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
