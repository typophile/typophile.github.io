  body: "Very nice, Aziz!  And here is my Japanese-calligraphy-inspired Arabic calligraphy
    of the Lord's Prayer. The style is not the well-known classical Chinese style
    (short angular strokes) but one used to write poetry in paintings and letters
    - so called grass writing because of its flowing lines.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lord's
