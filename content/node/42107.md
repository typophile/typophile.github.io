  body: "Whoa...this seems absurd. Seems that the best way to fend off the likes of
    MS would be to INVEST in design innovation. It also seems a bit of the baby-with-the-bathwater
    syndrome. They had 1000 folks on that staff!? Why not maybe let 900 go? Still

    really sure what the design innovation team is over there...are they part of the
    YUI team?)"

    but not that they necessarily had that many in that particular department. Stil...\r\n\r\n\"Their
