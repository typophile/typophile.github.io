  body: That's an interesting question mark. It seems awkward but maybe that's because
    I'm not used to seeing question marks look quite like that.

  body: "bemerx25: I would love to see some examples of question marks from signs
    and posters of that era. The examples I found were not suitable for this letter
    style. I guess the biggest problem is that signs and posters don't generally have
    question marks.\r\n\r\nriccard0 : Aggressive? I wasn't aware that an ampersand
    could be aggressive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    cute too).\r\nFor the ?, what about something like the upper part of 3 (including
    the flat vertical terminal)?"

  body: "I'd say totally keep the ampersand structure you had (if you must, add an
    alternate). It works, and this form is nice and rare enough. I'd only maybe make
    it a little less wide.\r\n\r\nBTW, is that a dollar sign next to the @? It looks
    like it's trying to be a punctuation mark of some sort. :-)"
