  to mostly handle illustration and logos but some time i have to reproduce lines
  of type from preexisting images. i have not worked with type like that since school
  does any one have any pointers or tips? right now i scan the image with the type
  in and tinker with it but sometimes i have the worst time getting everything to
  line up just right.\r\n\r\nthanks for the help."
