  and wonder if there is a typeface or font that feels representative of the city
  or whole country. Something whose shape could work with those of the Sydney Opera
  House (egg shapes, with curves) would be ideal. So far I've tried Sydney 2ooo and
  Merrivale, which was based on a late Victorian shopsign in Melbourne. However, I'm
  not in love with either of them. \r\n\r\nSuggestions would be greatly appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I hear you on being too literal. The audience is fans of pop jam bands i.e.
    Dave Matthews Band and Phish. The weather/sunshine would be a nice thing to evoke.
    Thanks for the recommendation of Lisboa, but think I need something that's display
    and decorative. Something that looks hand-lettered would be great, along the lines
    of what Methane Studios does:\r\n\r\nhttp://methanestudios.com/category/dave-matthews?item=6141\r\n\r\nThanks
    very much for your reply. It's also helping me to hone in on what I'm really going
    for!"
