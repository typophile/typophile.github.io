    assume based on your comment).\r\n\r\nYou can see that the Ultra Condensed one
    is a lot more square than the others, and the thickness of the thin bit on the
    bottom right doesn't vary that much (as best as I could make it)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: One thing to keep in mind when going from condensed to wide is maintaining
    the appearance of weight. Notice in some of these examples how much bolder the
    condensed appears compared to the extended. It's not too noticeable in the lightest
    weights, but the bolder you go, the more obvious it becomes. Weight is not just
    the relative thickness of the strokes, you must take into account the relationship
    of the strokes to the internal space.

  body: "<em>Would I make the vertical sections of the stroke wider? I was afraid
    that would give the appearance of stretching\u2026 suggestions?</em>\r\n\r\nNo,
    you want to keep the relative thickness of the horizontal and vertical strokes
    consistent, though not necessarily mechanically consistent. Your eye is the final
    arbiter. Basically, it means that the wider you go, the bolder you go, to keep
    the same color impression. Again, it's not a mechanical thing. You need to decide
    for yourself how much the stroke weight needs to change to achieve visual consistency.
    Take a look at type families with lots of widths and weights to see how others
    have done it.\r\n\r\n<em>Mark, would you suggest a book on letter construction
    and typeface design? Something practical, with examples?</em>\r\n\r\nThese may
    be hard to find, but here are some I like:\r\n\r\nType Sign Symbol, by Adrian
    Frutiger\r\nThe Modification of Letterforms, by Stanley Hess\r\nLettering Design,
    by Michael Harvey\r\n\r\nFor the most part, these books are concerned with drawing
    letters by hand, but the main principles apply to digital type as well."
