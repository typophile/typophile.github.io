  body: "Nope. First, the ideas that students think are great are often things that
    people with the technical skills have had, and realized are flawed.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    if you could make money with ideas (and not the execution of them) I would be
    a rich man.\r\n\r\nLearn the technical skills, and then the ideas can be realized,
    and you will discover the many that don't work, and can start to build your reputation
    with the few that do."

  body: 'But do they have people in the design industry who come up with concepts
    and concepts only and then pass over to the technical person. The problem I''m
    having is execution. I have immense creativity when it comes to ideas but lack
    execution skill. I am a student and can not pay a professional photographer to
    take great pictures or actually  make a product because of not being able to mould
    a product out of plastic etc. What happens then? There are certain restrictions
    being a student. '

    learning to work within your limits. Most designers don\u2019t do their own illustration,
    or photography, or molding of plastic packages; they pay productions specialists
    to do it. For school projects, don\u2019t try to do that stuff\u2014do other stuff
    instead. When I want great photos, I scan them or use stock, when I have to design
    a package I reuse existing components. But I don\u2019t worry about ideas that
    I can\u2019t produce\u2014I just think of something else instead."

  body: aah I see. Like for instance, I have a project at the moment about fruit and
    veg. I have seen many photographs but my work looks bad because of the photos.
    I cant do them well. The concept is good. Isnt that bad using someone elses photographs?

  body: "<cite>Isnt that bad using someone elses photographs?</cite>\r\n\r\nNot at
    all. A graphic designer\u2019s job is to communicate by bringing various sensory
    elements together in a way that works technically and aesthetically. Nobody expects
    a designer to do her own photography\u2014after all, just getting good at one
    area of photography can take years, much less being able to photograph everything
    from still life to portrait to urban architecture. If I wanted to do really great
    outdoor photography in downtown DC the camera alone would cost me tens of thousands
    of dollars and I wouldn\u2019t even know how to use it\u2014so using other people\u2019s
    work is the only option!\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of photographers who understand
    this and post their work on sites like Flickr and sxc.hu just for student (and
    low-budget) designers to use. And in most countries there are \u201Cfair use\u201D
    exceptions in copyright law that allow students to use other works for non-commercial
    purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial world, all these specialists are pretty well
    compensated for their work. They also often get credit (ever notice the name of
    the photographer alongside an image) or get paid extra to leave their name off
    the work. So it\u2019s really a win-win situation."

    is a separation between those who can  and those who think they can't. guess which
    one will get hired ?\r\n\r\nsecond : as a student you can employ all sorts of
    tricks and appropriation that will not be acceptable as a professional. it's understood
    that students needto experiment with ideas on limited budgets. when showing these
    works in an interview it can actually speak very well to your integrity if outside
    sources are properly credited.\r\n\r\nthird : most creative directors and \"idea
    people\" have risen in the ranks thru positions where they learned the skills
    that they now direct.\r\n\r\nfourth : be resourceful ! make a mock-up or a multi-view
    illustration if you can't produce the actual object.\r\n\r\nfifth : investigate
    the skill sets of your fellow students and consider collaborating or trading services.
    taking advantage of available resources is another attribute that will recognized
    in an interview. try to get into a \"can do\" mindset. make things happen.\r\n\r\n"

    I guess in industry, you have a photographer doing it so its much easier."

    by photography students is obviously different. Maybe I should join a part time
    photography course in the evenings to enhance the quality of my work. It will
    hopefully help in the future.

    think you will lose control on the total outcome of the project because a lack
    of understanding what that person is doing for you. Especially because you are
    a student (you have the time and space) I think you should do it yourself but
    ask help from someone that has the knowledge and can guide you during the shoot.

    He or she is just trying to encourage you to try many different things so that
    you have an appreciation of what goes into design. A broad set of skills is useful,
    and so is resourcefulness. The more work you do as a student in different areas
    of design will eventually give you a better idea of what you want to specialize

  body: "I read this thread with interest ... misgiggles when you are an art director
    you will never be required to take a photograph. That's what photographers and
    illustrators are for. You have an idea, then you commission a photographer whose
    style is in tune with what you are looking for in your design. You brief the photographer
    clearly, most often direct the shoot and he or she produces an image that is partly
    yours. So you are not appropriating someone else's work as the photographer is
    having to execute your idea. \r\nThis is one of the skills you should be learning
    at college, and one which you will be constantly improving through your industry
    experience. "
