  body: Thanks for the feedback thus far. Nick Sherman has a Miller & Richard specimen
    book, so I've asked him to have a look to see if he can find it, but if anyone
    else has any ideas, please let me know...

  body: "Found it in an undated Miller & Richards catalog from the University of California
    collection, digitized by Microsoft. Good luck finding a digital version: the original
    typeface was named <strong>Trajan</strong> (pp. 317 <em>et seq.</em>). Go figure...\r\n\r\nNote:
    the specimen book doesn't show an ampersand for the Roman, but it does for the
    Bold weight, and the design matches the second ampersand shown."
