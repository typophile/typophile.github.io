body: "I never learned how to type certain accents over letters. I have a client that
  needs the macron (I just found out its name) accent ' \xAF ' over the letter ' e
  ' but most fonts have premade \xE9 characters only as the closest (and incorrect)
  equivalent. I know that the accent is included, but aside from typing the ' < '
  key while holding down the Shift and Option keys on a Mac to get the accent by itself,
  I don't know how to get this accent over the vowel. \r\n\r\nCan someone tell me
  how to do this?  I learned page layout programs by myself in the 90s as I finished
  graphic design back when we still did paste-up, so I'm feeling rather unsophisticated
  about how to use accent features. But I figure I'd rather ask for help than go dumb
  - it's an accent I need for a particular client whose name is always mispronounced.
  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, since many fonts have pre-made letters with accents, is this
  something that would be better off with a specific letter e with the macron already
  pre-placed?  It will always be used with this client, and I'm not sure if larger
  display layouts would represent the best application of the accent.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be greatly appreciated."

    as I'm only seeing the trimmed version (even if the full version shows up when
    i try to edit it). Any assistance navigating the forum workings would be appreciated.

  body: "Bakla, I edited your post for you. There is a bug in the system. Ok, not
    a bug. If you use ' \" ' followed by ' < ' it instantly watches for the rest of
    the code as if you were formatting something. I removed the \" and replaced them
    with ' so you can now see you entire entry. Now maybe someone can help with your
    question. \r\n\r\nYour problem has nothing to do with being a newbie. Glad you
    are here and joining in the discussions."

  body: If you're using Quark, a simple -- if somewhat inelegant solution -- is to
    type the e followed by an _underscore. Select the underscore, then shift the baseline
    up the equivalent of 83% (five-sixths) of the point size you are using (more or
    less, depending on the typeface), and use negative tracking to place the underscore
    over the e. Crude, but effective.

  body: "Thanks for the assist, Tiffany.  And thanks oldnick and chad.  I'm using
    Tstar specifically for this client, and the font has the accents as separate keystrokes
    (including the macron), but I just don't know how to apply them to specific letters.
    \ Oldnick, your solution sounds like a creative stopgap measure in case I don't
    learn how to apply those accents. Chad, unfortunately, I use Quark Express a lot,
    and the glyph function isn't available in this program to my knowledge.  Sadly,
    even in Illustrator, I couldn't get the glyph item in the Type menu to highlight
    with Tstar, so I'm still at a loss.  Maybe someone will know exactly how this
    is done...\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I've emailed the font designer for assistance.
    \ Hopefully he can help. "

    the vowel following and kern the one under the other (approximately -80) at least
    you won't have to baseline shift each time, if you have an i to do the dotless
    i is option shift b. I tried Chad's copy and paste but got an umlaut over an i

    my time), I am surely biased. But typography features are one area where InDesign
    has been ahead of QuarkXPress since day one, and that gap has only widened with
    time. People can like Quark's interface better, or be happier with some particular
    features, but I can't imagine somebody who is honestly familiar with both programs
    arguing that QuarkXPress has better typographic features.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    body: "Timd, that sounds like a great solution for now!  Thanks!\r\n\r\nIn a way,
      I'm kinda glad that no one really knows the perfect way to type this accent
      in properly - it makes me feel less inept! I was under the impression that it
      was something I was just unaware of, especially in a typographic forum like
      this one, where I imagine people who create fonts would know all the keystrokes
      to type them.\r\n\r\ntphinney, I'm anxiously looking forward to trying out InDesign.
      \ After waiting for my printers to begin supporting it, and after much positive
      feedback about it, my loyalties to Quark are wavering. I've avoided upgrading
      to OSX until now specifically because Quark Xpress was still buggy on all my
      fellow Art Directors computers, despite Quark's upgrades to supposedly make
      them OSX native (although I hear 6.5 is better). After using Quark Xpress for
      over 12 years, I'm so used to it that I didn't want to relearn a new program,
      but methinks now is the time.  Hell, if I didn't go with the flow, I'd probably
      still be using Syquest disks when sending things to the printers!  ;) \r\n\r\nNepenthe,
      since I'm on a Mac, the Windows link you presented doesn't help me.  But thanks
      all for the suggestions and info so far."

  body: Bringhurst says that you can remap your keyboard to allow access to any accents
    available in unicode fonts, but I have yet to discover how this is possible. It
    seems strange to me that in TeX (which is over 20 years old) all accents are readily
    accessible, but in modern software you have to go to a glyph palette to do this.
    For example, for e+macron in TeX you just type \={e} which is so much easier than
    locating a glyph from a palette or character map; but then, font installation
    and graphics in TeX are not exactly intuitive...
