  languages including Romanian. However, my copy of Franklin Gothic Demi (ITC) seems
  not to include Romanian characters. I have been looking online to purchase a font
  that will solve this problem and found this from URW: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/franklin-gothic/t-demi/\r\n\r\nAm
  I correct in that this font contains Romanian characters?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nFredrik"

  body: "I have now tried various versions of Franklin and though they contain the
    typical Romanian characters \u0163, \u015F, and \u015E, these characters won't
    appear when publishing the flash file.\r\nIn fact they appear as default sans
    characters if using static text, and not at all if using dynamic text (embedding
    the characters). See screenshot of workspace canvas below.\r\n\r\nI would be very
    interested in hearing if anyone else has come across this issue. I have searched
    online for references, but only found similar issues relating to the Konqueror
    browser.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rom_4923.png]"
