body: Hi, <BR>The logo will go on the heads of the guitars, and is the first name
  of the guitar maker. The woods are generally dark so I&#39;m picturing this in white
  or cream, although if I can figure out how to get it to look good in metallic gold,
  I might go that route. Anyhow, after some sketching, I&#39;ve cleaned up my favorites
  a little and here they are. Please let me know what you think, and I&#39;ll rework
  the best ones some &#40;well, a lot&#41; more. <BR>Thanks, <BR>Brian <BR> <BR><img

  body: What kind of guitars is he making &#40;acoustic/electric&#41; and what kind
    of music would he like the guitars to be associated with? <BR> <BR>I like the
    first one most, even if it looks like something else that I have seen before on
    some guitars &#40;can&#39;t remember which brand&#41; <BR> <BR>Left/bottom has
    a certain quirkiness &#40;caused by the &#39;y&#39;&#41; that I like, but it has
    to be worked on more. How about an &#39;E&#39; drawn with a single stroke? <BR>
    <BR>Right/top is the one I find weakest.

  body: I don&#39;t know that I would necessarily worry about what kind of music these
    guitars will be associated with. If they are good guitars you won&#39;t want to
    limit the market and the market will in turn not want to be limited. By that I
    just mean most guitarists who are in it for the long haul don&#39;t only own one
    guitar because they can&#39;t create all the sounds they want to with one guitar.
    Their &#34;vocal&#34; range is dependant upon several different instruments. <BR>
    <BR>When I saw these first sketches, the three on the left were more interesting
    to me, the bottom two being stronger than the top. The bottom being expected,
    not necessarily a bad thing, and the middle being the most interesting. The bottom
    could have a little bit more of warmth by adding more of that wedge serif you&#39;ve
    used on the R. The monolinear nature of the middle though needs to be pushed and
    explored. I&#39;d say play with contrast.

  body: You may want to consider the shape of the peghead and its interaction with
    the design of the logo &#40;mind the washers that hold the tuning keys in place&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, see if the maker uses the same color tuning keys all the time &#40;gold,
    chrome, ivory finish etc.&#41;. I&#39;ve found guitarists are sometimes sensitive
    to everything matching, or at least coordinating on their instruments.

- body: I asked a few questions, and he &#40;Henry&#41; doesn&#39;t ever plan on making
    electric guitars. I haven&#39;t asked about tuning key colors but I will soon.
    <BR>He and his friends basically just play classical guitar music, like maybe
    something you&#39;d hear from eric clapton. Some fingerpicking, but also using
    a pick, or strumming by hand. Nothing heavy, and nothing country. I do think the
    middle two are off because of this, but I&#39;ll try a few more revisions on just
    the middle-left one.  <BR>I think the bottom left may end up being the best so
    I&#39;m saving it for last - I think the single-stroke E would mirror the R really
    well. <BR> <BR>In the meantime, here&#39;s an update on the first one. Thanks
    again for all the thoughtful comments! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64683.gif"

  body: The last concept feels very &#39;Fender&#39; -- I know that technically it&#39;s
    not very much like the Fender logo at all, but it does have that feeling about
    it. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s blues they&#39;re playing, maybe you could go back to
    some classic blue-style inspiration. Think dirty, rough, customised, worn; the
    blues to me &#40;I&#39;m a big fan&#41; is all about feeling, emotion, empathy;
    try and get some blood, sweat and tears into the logo. I know that&#39;s all a
    bit clich

- body: 'I almost didn&#39;t mention any names because I don&#39;t want to have too
    specific of a feel. The main thing is that it will go on acoustic guitars that
    don&#39;t need amplification. Some other ideas I&#39;m trying to go for are: natural,
    man-made, and quality. <BR> <BR>This version is an angled script like D&#39;Aquisto,
    Fender, and Gibson. I think the logo should look like a guitar logo, but hopefully
    it can still be unique.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also concerned about the loop in the
    H and the loop in the y balancing. Also the n is not at exactly the same slant
    as everything else &#40;it&#39;s baroque! -er, not really&#41; so that the left
    stem of the n didn&#39;t get too clogged up where it meets the e and the stroke
    at the top of the n. I took out a small wedge at the top of the n to help. I&#39;m
    not sure how much this will come into play if we need to screen it. But maybe
    this non-perfect angle makes it seem less mechanical. <BR> <BR>I do still want
    the final logo to feel personal and have some character even though I might not
    be going directly for &#39;blues&#39;. So I just might end up giving it some texture,
    as long as it doesn&#39;t take too much away from any quality aspect.'

  body: I think all of the slightly irregular things in the logo &#40;the loops&#39;
    balance, the n slant&#41; actually contribute to it&#39;s &#39;authenticity&#39;,
    it&#39;d look too mechanical if everything slotted together too well IMO. <BR>
    <BR>That said, I would maybe bring the H loop down a little, so that the left
    stem of the H has a bit more length to it -- this may help the balance a little
    too without looking deliberate! <BR> <BR>Jordan

    this isn&#39;t a rush project! <BR> <BR>I gave Henry four different &#34;directions&#34;:

    <BR> <BR>He chose the third idea. I&#39;m pretty sure at this point that we&#39;ll
    be using a gold decal. The area for the logo on the guitar is fairly small - roughly
    8p x 3p. The pegs &amp; hardware will be metallic gold, and the wood is a fairly
    dark brown. After many adjustments, including redrawing the grid, here&#39;s what
    I came up with. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67764.gif"
    alt="whattya think"> <BR>Since the gold lettering will show up lighter than the
    brown wood, the reversed logo is probably more accurate. But there&#39;s both.
    <BR> <BR>What do you think? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Brian'

  body: I like it. Have you thought about using a capital &#34;H&#34; for the last
    design? I think the &#34;h&#34; in the small white on black version could be mistaken
    for &#34;fi&#34;. Just a thought.

    I also noticed that the &#39;ry&#39; ligature is too tight, creating an optical
    illusion almost &#40;The further back you are when you look at it, the more you
    can&#39;t tell where the r ends and the y starts&#41;. In &#40;b&#41;, I tried
    making the r-y joint rounded, but pulling the pen back inside helped define the
    r, especially at small sizes, so in the last version &#40;f&#41; I redrew the
    joint so that it was the same style but spread apart more. <BR> <BR>&#40;a&#41;
    is the version from the last post. &#40;c&#41; and &#40;d&#41; show two versions
    of the h, to get rid of the appearance of &#34;fi&#34;. <BR> <BR>I also spaced
    the letters out more. This helped them match up with the new &#39;ry&#39; spacing
    and also made them easier to identify. <BR> <BR>The letters involve a few sharper
    angles where previously there were curves. Also, the first downstroke on the h,
    n, and r have a bit of a flair, and this also happens on the upstroke of the y.
    I know this still doesn&#39;t have the personality of some of the previous logo
    versions, but hopefully that at least gives it something. <BR> <BR>Lastly, I leveled
    out the bottoms &#40;e&#41; where before I was keeping the 45

  body: I like the balance that the lowercase h shares with the y and the ry ligature
    in version b, especially the reversed out version b2. I believe that it is the
    vertical stem of the h and y that is leading to the fi confusion if it ended a
    bit higher &#40;in the case of the h&#41; to compensate for the angle of the baseline
    might be a solution. <BR>Tim

  body: 'I like the cap H. Not too feminine in my opinion. More workman. It&#39;s
    nice how the top right of the H echos the y tail. For a more ornate instrument,
    it might be nice to really swash out the tail of the y and the top right of the
    H, either creating some kind of wave into a little swirl or stacked ribbon top
    and bottom or possibly a double wave rule top and bottom. This would look great
    on acoustic instruments from mandolin to dreadnaught. <BR> <BR>Bottom line: I&#39;d
    be proud to see this on my headstock. Bravo for drawing the letters. Type ID section
    will soon get requests for the Henry guitar logo font. And we will proudly say:
    sorry it&#39;s custom. <BR> <BR>Randy'
