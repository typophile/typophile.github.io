  body: I assume you're joking, Simon, but, so as not to confuse Manel, I think it
    should be pointed out that the grungetastic part is due to years of wear and tear
    and was not part of the original design.

    printing]] technology? If so, This happens when your [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_registration|registration]]
    is off. It''s considered a mistake. The picture you posted would be an example
    of someone using this as a style, exaggerating it on purpose. On a related note,
    you might want to look at  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_angle|screen

  body: "I just scanned my copy of the MIT Bauhaus book. Here is a highly enlarged
    image of the lower right corner showing the \"B\".  See how buildup of ink in
    not a problem for 2 colors (200% coverage) but starts to lift on 3 colors (300%
    coverage). This only shows at extreme enlargement and with a bit of level tweaking
    in PhotoShop. When you see the book on the shelf, it was not noticeable to the
    untrained eye. I am sure the pressmen worked hard to keep it clean though! Pressmen
    in those days earned their keep adjusting keys, wash and dryers :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauhausBk_5671.png]\r\n\r\nChrisL"
