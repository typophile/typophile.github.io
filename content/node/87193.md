  body: "i personally wouldn't have done the typography like that.\r\nI created this
    flier, but the client was directing where he\r\nwanted everything placed at.\r\nhe
    was just going off what he thought looked good, rather \r\nthan typical typographic
    thinking. \r\nI don't think the flier turned out bad. We got it printed, \r\nand
    it looks decent looking.\r\nI feel the typographic layout can be more logical,\r\nand
    the hierarchy clearer.\r\nWhat do you guys think?"

  body: "a few things bother me - is it kids clothing?\r\n\r\nthe panda and balloon
    concept tells me this - but the panda looks bored?\r\n\r\nif it's a kids thing
    - why the snake in the background?\r\n\r\nwhy the \"boring\" colours?\r\n\r\nrather
    than having a \"brand release party\" you should have had a \"crfty party\" to
    celebrate the launch.\r\n\r\nthe typography and layout is very asian - the QR?
    barcode thing looks like a chinese japanese character and i expect the rest of
    the info to be not in english"

    some photos of some of the products we ended up making.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/etahchen/sets/72157628252379381/\r\nAbout
    your critique, the client was asian and owned a Thai Restaurant. That might be
    why. That's funny because i thought it looked like the fliers for his restaurant.
    The panda concept was the clients idea, but the clothes are not for kids. This
    flier was kind of a failure in my opinion."
