body: I'm just learning type design and figured a good project for learning the ins
  and outs of the technical side would be to digitize my own handwriting. I used my
  wacom tablet to sketch up the initial designs in illustrator, and tweaked them there.
  Brought them into fontlab, and made this... even managed to get a few special ligatures
  in there on my first try! Any comments would be helpful. Thanks!

  body: I'm not a graphologist but the downwards-pointing t and I look a bit depressing
    to me. If you make them point upwards the font would certainly look much more
    cheerful, if that is what you want.

  body: "This looks quite well to me already.\r\n\r\nSome things I see at first glance:\r\n\"3\"
    ist a bit strange, \"k\" in the same way. They need corners. See the \"w\" (which
    needs more weight)\r\n\"5\" too (it's hanging to the left too much)\r\n\"t\" should
    look upwards, Tim is right\r\n\"p\" needs some more energy\r\n\"d\" is very narrow
    (compare to \"a\", but don't imitate it)\r\npunctuation seems to be too small,
    give it the appropriate size.\r\n\"slashed 0\": make it an option via opentype\r\n\r\nIf
    everything is more mature and balanced (this will take you a while, don't be too
    hasty), you will need ligatures and maybe alternate versions of the letters for
    word beginnings and endings. This will give the font even more life. Don't start
    with this too early, the basic character set has to be almost perfect before you
    start, or you will generate a lot of unnecessary additional work."

  body: "I just saw your \"hy\"-ligature:\r\n\r\nIf creating them, always consider
    whether this would be a possible natural form when handwriting. I can't think
    of a common writhing method that creates something like this \"hy\".\r\n\r\nSee
    this picture:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liga_5585.gif]\r\n\r\nleft
    you can see the stroke numbers how \"h\" and \"y\" are usually written.\r\nThere
    is no possibility how (4) could be written as extension of (2), it would not be
    natural (even if it looks good) as the direction of the strokes are the opposite
    direction and they are not drawn in order.\r\nDrawing it like on the right side
    (red), this would mean to start the \"y\" from the wrong side. This does not feel
    natural at all.\r\n\r\n\"Real\" ligatures would for example be:\r\nff, tt  -->
    \ common bar\r\ner, em, en  -->  the ending of the \"e\" easily connects to the
    beginning of r, m or n, it's a natural movement. Don't smoothly connect \"es\",
    even if it just seems to be perfect: \"s\" is not written from bottom to top,
    but if connecting the \"s\" with the bottom of the \"e\", the natural movement
    would suggest this direction.\r\nti --> the crossbar of the t leads to the beginning
    of the next letter\r\n\r\nThere are many opportunities for ligatures in script
    fonts, just look what happens when you write these combinations quickly and follow
    that hint. Don't invent \"new\" ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I find that your capital O is a little D-like. I read \"Oedipal\" as \"Dedipal\"
    until I zoomed in considerably. However, your handwriting is your handwriting
    (Gertrude Stein, anyone?), and I respect that if that's how you make your O. Just
    consider that (hopefully) others will be using this font, so uninterrupted readability
    is paramount.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Having made a couple of my own, including
    my own handwriting, I know how time-consuming this is. Nice work!\r\n\r\nGood
    luck,\r\nRay"

  body: "Tim: I see exactly what you mean... I noticed something with those characters,
    thanks for pinpointing what it was.\r\n\r\nSebastian: all of your first glance
    comments are correct; I think I just took too little time in reforming some of
    the letters. I slashed the zero because I always do that in my handwriting, this
    will probably be more for personal use: it's just my learning experience. Same
    with the hy ligature, the characters didn't fit together so I just lazily made
    one that ran together, which allowed me a chance to try to code some ligatures
    (tricky, but I'm figuring it out, I think). I do not plan, as I start laying out
    my first real font, to use any ligatures other than those normally used, fi, ff,
    ffl, etc.\r\n\r\nmicrospective: the capital O is an issue, not only in this font,
    but in my actual handwriting. They've always lacked character. Hopefully, this
    is something I can work on before coming back to this font later.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments, guys, I'll be checking the thread for any further comments
    so if anyone else has input, please do share!"

  body: The slope of the t's crossbar doesn't bother me, but it does seem a little
    long for practical purposes.

  body: "Well, I agree with Tim about the <em>depressing strokes</em>, specially on
    <strong>I, f, t</strong> ones, with Sebastian about the <strong>3, 5, p, d</strong>
    and about the ligatures and with microspective about the <strong>O/D</strong>...\r\n\r\nBut
    also I think the <em>intention</em> of the <strong>k</strong> is nice. I like
    the movement... Maybe if it ends more <em>swatched</em>... Ow! The <strong>N</strong>
    looks <em>rotated</em>... ;-)\r\n\r\nThe contrast you are using reminds me a bit
    of House's <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=27&subpage=viewfonts\"><strong>Castaways</strong></a>...
