    I reduced the width to 50% -- so that the dot on the I is round not a wide oval\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnknownTypophile116830Width@50Pct_6447.jpg]\r\nNow
    it looks more familiar.\r\nVery similar to Futura Extra Bold, but the _e_ is different.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Wow!!! Thanks for the help Don!! :)))\r\nI noticed the 'e' in Futura Extra
    Bold that's why I posted the picture here to identify the correct font! \r\nYou've
    made quite some work of it! :)\r\nThe unstretched version really looks like Futura
    although I like this 'e' more then the original... \r\n\r\nHere's another picture
    of a different product of that time made by Moog:\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rScBRKlTdoE/TAGeXU8aV1I/AAAAAAABFyw/sQME7_mf4xU/s1600/P5280013.jpg\r\n\r\nHere
    I also like the lowercase 'g' more then in the Futura Extra Bold. The 'y' seems
    just a bit different too.\r\nThe rest seems to be similar when scaling the whole
    50%.\r\n\r\nThe Ol London font is a nice find too!! Maybe I'll just go for that
    one!\r\n\r\nThanks Don! "

    can't spot any difference between OL London and the your second image. \r\nI suspect
    that OL might have based OL London on the same photo-lettering era font as was
    used by Moog. This is way too close for co-incidence.\r\nDon"
