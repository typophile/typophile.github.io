body: so this is a pretty general question, but about how long does it take you to
  work up a typeface from start to finish? by that i mean just a lowercase and uppercase
  from sketches to working font &#40;or however you may start and whatever you may
  call a working font/end product&#41; <BR> <BR>will

  body: It depends on bunches and bunches of things. <BR>It might take a couple of
    days to hack out a cheesy display face, or it might take many hundreds of hours
    to craft a good text face. The slowest I&#39;ve gone averages out to one glyph
    a day. <BR> <BR>Typically though, for a person with decent talent and skill, it
    might take two solid weeks to produce a basic character set that&#39;s minimally
    good. For a novice, maybe 2-3 times longer? I&#39;m just guessing though. <BR>

  body: thanks hrant, <BR> <BR>i&#39;m on the verge of starting some typefaces i&#39;ve
    been playing around with for quite some time. i&#39;ve got a lot of motivation
    and ambition right now, but those 2 things usually hit the wall of reality at
    some point and never really setting out and doing it the right way from step 1,
    i&#39;m just curious and interested as to what i can expect my pace to be. my
    guess will be slow. very slow.
