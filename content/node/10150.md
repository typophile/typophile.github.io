body: 'Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for a type face for the company I work for. We
  are a press cuttings agency, which means we provide clients with information and
  summaries of the coverage they receive in the printed press &#40;whether they&#39;re
  liked, who&#39;s writing about them etc.&#41; Our product is naturally quite abstract
  and we tend to change image frequently. I would like to find a type face to use
  as a solid foundation to build a complete branding on. <BR> <BR>I suppose almost
  everyone wants to look professional and business-like, but in addition I want to
  convey a sense of honesty, simplicity and accuracy. <BR> <BR>The font will have
  to be comfortable on screen as that&#39;s where it will be seen most often &#40;pdfs
  &amp; website&#41;, it will also have to stand up to being faxed &#40;we send out
  50-100 faxes a day&#41;. Occasionally it may be used in small scale advertising
  but far less frequently than our everyday use. <BR> <BR>I envisage use as body type
  with probably a variety of weights to allow one to be used for display. <BR> <BR>I
  like the look of avenir: <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003224"
  target="_blank">http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003224</a>
  but I&#39;m a little unsure and wondered if anyone favoured an alternative. <BR>
  <BR>The budget doesn&#39;t exist yet as I want something to present when I ask my
  boss for money. If it&#39;s not too pricey, I may pay for it myself. <BR> <BR>I
  would greatly appreciate suggestions.'

  body: I would think that a newspaper headline font would be appropriate. Fontbureau
    has lots.

    range of weights. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximasans.html"

  body: I want to avoid the newspaper font route, I want  a clear distinction between
    information we&#39;re supplying and the information we author. Also, the industry
    now monitors more than just newspapers so I don&#39;t want to date us. <BR> <BR>I
    like proxima sans, but I think Gotham may be what I&#39;m looking for. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for your suggestions <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: If you want something that is clearly not newspaper, and has a kind of efficient,
    tech aura but with some warmth you might look at <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html"

  body: Benjie, <BR> <BR>Thanks for positive response on some of my typefaces. Well
    to judge from your first pick &#40;Avenir&#41;, I think both Stalemate and Sophisto
    could do well and meet your requets. Stalemate was made to fit well, both in print
    and on the web. You might find some limitation in weights, it all depends on the
    size of this project and graphic profile? Sophisto on the other hand has many
    weights and addtionla features. Also a set of 5 dingbats and patterns which could
    be very useful is mastered with cleverness. Pdf-files are availabe for download
    at the MRF website. Please take a moment and let me know if you ahve further questions.
    <BR> <BR>Cheers/SH

  body: I kinda wish the choices were more limited &#40;make it easier&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I can see possibilities wth all the suggestions. Price is likely to come in
    a bit &#40;because I&#39;ll be buying multiple licenses&#41; but I&#39;ll stick
    them all on the shortlist and muse on it over the weekend. <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    taking the time <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
