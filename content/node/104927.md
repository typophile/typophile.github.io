body: "Is it possible to generate a font with only the glyphs that I designed in fontlab.
  It seems like when I use my typeface in other applications for glyphs that I didn't
  design it replaces them with a standard glyph which I do not want displayed. \r\n\r\nIt
  might be a silly question, but thanks in advance."

  body: "I hope the following answers your question; if not, you will need to be more
    precise. I  know FontLab only very superficially  but I don't think it generates
    anything else than what you designed. \r\n\r\nHere is what you seem to be experiencing.
    On OS X and on Windows, TextEdit, Word, Pages, Powerpoint (standard Mac and Windows
    applications)  use a \"fallback font\" when the current font is missing a character.
    To avoid that you need an application that does not rely on the fallback mechanism.
    I know that Adobe InDesign would not replace your missing glyphs by those of a
    fallback font. If you are on a campus with a fast connection, you can install
    texlive 2013 (on the Mac, it is <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/mactex/\">MacTeX</a>,
    on the PC, <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/texlive/\">TeX Live</a>). It comes with
    XeLaTeX that does not use the fallback mechanism either. Here is how MacTeX looks
    (with TeXShop); first the input file:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/xelatex_4867.png\">\r\n\r\nand
    now what I get after clicking \"Typeset\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/bonjour_6323.png\">\r\n\r\nThe
    font does not contain Hebrew characters and they are displayed as missing.\r\n\r\nYou
    could also try <a href=\"http://www.lyx.org/Home\">LyX</a>, that is built on top
    of TeX and is supposedly more user friendly."

  body: "Of course, texlive also runs on Unix.\r\n\r\nOnce texlive is installed, you
    also have lualatex. If you have any doubt about the glyph list in your font, here
    is a lualatex script that will give it (from the manual)\r\n<PRE>\r\n--- file
    lglyphs.lua --- cut here\r\n#!/usr/bin/env lualatex\r\n\r\nlocal f = fontloader.open(arg[1])\r\nlocal
    i = 0\r\nwhile (i < f.glyphmax) do\r\n  local g = f.glyphs[i]\r\n  if g then\r\n
    \   print(g.name)\r\n  end\r\n  i = i + 1\r\nend\r\nfontloader.close(f)\r\n---
    cut line ---\r\n</PRE>\r\nThen\r\n<PRE>\r\nlualatex lglyphs.lua fontfile\r\n</PRE>\r\nwill
    give you the glyph list in your font file. You can make that file executable and
    run it as a unix script but on my mac it needs the extension .lua to work."

  body: FontLab <em>is</em> only generating the fonts you create. The other glyphs
    you see being displayed in software are fallback fonts, i.e. the default fonts
    used by that software to display characters that are not supported in your font.

    extension if  the first line is replaced by\r\n<PRE>\r\n#!/usr/bin/env texlua\r\n</PRE>\r\nand
    will then execute properly.  Other options can be found in the manual at http://www.luatex.org/svn/trunk/manual/luatexref-t.pdf"
