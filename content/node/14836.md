  body: Yves, what about deviding the ID Forum into more specialized ones (eg Sans,
    Serif, Script, and so on). I am absolutely no good at all with Scripts, so that
    would save me some time... ; )

    Sans and Serif etcetera... In my mind that's like not knowing the difference between
    Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay...\r\n\r\nBut, wait\u2026 Lots of people don't
    know that either\u2026 \r\n\r\nOh S\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2026  What's the world
    coming to! This is too awful to contemplate. "

    is.\r\n\r\nI don't drink wine, so you'd have to teach me about that.  So what
    kind of wine do they make from raisins?  ;)"
