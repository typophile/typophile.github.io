body: I am reading &#40;and very much enjoying&#41; a treatise on writing style called
  &#34;The Sound on the Page,&#34; by Ben Yagoda. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48870.jpg"
  alt="Book Cover &#34;The Sound on the Page&#34;"> <BR> <BR>I was struck by the cover
  design in the store. The type used is a lot like Johnston and Gill &#40;maybe with
  a bit of Kabel as well&#41;, but the idiosyncratically low crossbars on E, F, A,
  etc. differ. <BR> <BR>Neither Identifont nor WhatTheFont could ID it. Any thoughts
  from our forum&#39;s much-smarter human experts? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Brent

  body: Yes, you are correct. Thanks! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s not in the
    Identifont database. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Brent
