body: "\r\n\r\nJust starting out here. First 'real' design job and I've hit a bump
  in the road...\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused about buying licenses to use fonts. I know
  that it's a requirement but have no clue about them.\r\nWhen designing a logo for
  a company to use on a website and print, the designer/ client needs a license to
  use it right?\r\nDo I (the designer) buy the license or does the client? And which
  type of license is required? Is it purchased when buying the font?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  or advice would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively does anyone know
  any free alternatives to DIN light and DIN 1415?"

    listed there. Each of them may be different. But that is it contains a law basis
    which will legalize you use the relevant font. As a designer, you could have a
    cost for the client to license the font, but it means the license's font belongs
    to your client. It all depends on your agreement with them.\r\n\r\nBest Regards"

    get the font for free with it. Oh, they say you're buying a font, but you're not.
    Read it (the licence) really carefully (this is a good time for deerstalker and
    magnifier) for it details--or at least should detail--what you may and mayn't
    do with the font.\r\n\r\nThe logo designer will need a licence for the fonts (s)he
    uses. The client? If your client  is using the font to produce new text, then
    yes. If the client is just rubberstamping with a pre-prepared logo, (s)he will
    probably not need hir own licence.\r\n\r\nThe folk behind the \"Open Letter to
    Monotype\" (see thread of same name) have been doodling a freely-available DIN
    type, if I remember correctly."

    if you get a free font. you are still bound by the EULA. \r\n\r\nIt was all about

    and or the second party clients. It all depends on who the end user, IMHO\r\n\r\nBest

  body: "To add simple answers to your questions:\r\nWhoever INSTALLS the fonts needs
    a license in the name of the user or company where the fonts are INSTALLED. \r\nIt
    usually doesn't matter what the fonts are used for. If your clients just get PDFs,
    logos converted to vector graphics and so on, they don't need a license. \r\n\r\nAnd
    in addition to Andi\u2019s comment: \r\nIt doesn't matter how the money flows.
    You might charge your client for purchasing the font license, but that doesn\u2019t
    mean they own it then or could use the font. Nor could you grant them permission
    to do so. The only thing that matters is, which user (licensee) is specified in
    the font license. "

  body: "\"It usually doesn't matter what the fonts are used for\"\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't,
    but there are common (though not universal) exceptions. Typically, you can't use
    the type created from the font as part of a commercial product (like kid's blocks
    using the letters as the design). And, often, you're not allowed to embed the
    font without a separate license (in a PDF, as part of software, etc.)\r\n\r\nSome
    foundries also require separate licenses for identity work (for instance, I believe
    House requires a separate license if you want to use their fonts in a logo). \r\n"

    received no response. If I want to use Neutra for my company logo, what do I pay?
    Any advice would be great; I\u2019m not very computer literate so have trouble
    with all language on the site. I really resent buying from them, I understand
    the value of intellectual property but the sarcastic tone of their website is
    really off putting. I also can\u2019t find anything on the House website about
    a royalty or licence to the Neutra family or to the Eames Foundation; maybe they
    do but I couldn\u2019t find it. If anyone has any suggestions about a similar
    font, happy to pay for it but just want the freedom to use it,that would be really
    helpful. I have bought fonts before from the font factory and didn\u2019t have
    any trouble using them."

    $US250 to do this plus the fee for the font. Which is fine but I'm unsure if I
    need to.If I design the logo with a House font then use it on a pdf will that
    work ? I'm sorry I'm sure it is very tiresome for all you experts to have to deal
    with individuals who aren\u2019t as familiar as you are, with how this all works\u2026
    I was hoping I could buy a font from the website then design my little logo and
    send out my little letter heads to the printer to get printed\u2026but I think
    I will have to employ a designer to do this. MB why the curt response, if I responded
    to my clients in the same belittling manner then I wouldn\u2019t need a bloody
    letter head at all.I have no problem paying for their IP and respect the design
    process. I did email Dion Neutra who said that House Industries do pay a royalty;
    which is great. I will try to contact them again, which would be my third email
    to them in as many months."

  body: I am not sure if all the questions have been answered, but if it were me,
    I would only use the logo as outlines, and never as text.  This of course avoids
    any issues with font embedding, and allows you some level of control over people
    modifying your logo (consistency is key in branding).  You probably want to manually
    adjust kerning and spacing to fit your project too, and it is a bit risky to assume
    those attributes will carry over if you bring your logo into a program as text.  Anyway,
    my point is that you should convert your final design to outlines to make your
    logo design master, usually *.eps format.
