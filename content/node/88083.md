  I'm not able yet to discern individual fonts.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know perchance
  what font the FT uses? It's my favourite newspaper by a mile!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    I have a copy of the paper sitting right in front of me but it doesn't give anything
    away. There appear to be multiple fonts in use, serif and sans-serif. If I had
    a scanner I could upload a copy of the front sheet to illustrate this, but unfortunately
    I haven't. I did try the website to see if it was any help but of course you need
    to be a subscriber to get access to anything meaningful.
