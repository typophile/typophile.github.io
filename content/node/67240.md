body: "Hey, I was wondering if anyone could help me with a python script. I'm making
  a script font, and would like to substitute out the final glyph in each word (with
  one that has a finishing flourish).\r\n\r\nI remember seeing something like that
  here before, but I can't find it now :("

  body: "By the way, the groups can be made either in the OT editor in FontLab, either
    just before the feature code, or in the lower pane of the OT editor panel. Or,
    you can use the Classes panel, select \"New OpenType Class\" from the pop-up,
    and use this syntax:\r\n\r\ngroup_name: <em>list of glyphs</em>\r\n\r\nI prefer
    putting it all in the OT editor. Seems easier to manage."

  body: "Python? Do you mean coding an OpenType feature?\r\n\r\nIf so, it goes like
    this:\r\n\r\nMake a few groups:\r\n\r\n@any_letter = [ <em>a list of all letters
    from your font that could be part of a word</em> ] ;\r\n\r\n@not_final = [ <em>a
    list of the non-final glyph forms</em> ] ;\r\n\r\n@final = [ <em>a list of the
    final glyph forms (same order, same number of glyphs) </em>] ;\r\n\r\nHere is
    the feature code, which should be put in the calt feature:\r\n\r\nfeature calt
    {\r\n\r\nlookup fix_finals {\r\nignore sub @not_final' @any_letter ;\r\nsub @not_final'
    by @final ;\r\n} fix_finals ;\r\n\r\n} calt ;\r\n\r\nThe \"ignore\" part means
    skip the rest if another letter follows. If no letter follows, then the substitution
    happens.\r\n"

  body: "So it's working when I test in the fontlab opentype tester window, but not
    when I use it in Indesign or Illustrator. Is there a feature in opentype I have
    to turn on for this to work? (all my other scripts are working though)\r\n\r\nOr
    did I do something wrong :("

  body: "Is this the only feature in the font? There is a bug in InDesign where it
    ignores a feature if it is the only one.\r\n\r\nIf that's not the case, it could
    be that you have contextual alternates unchecked in InDesign.\r\n\r\nIt's also
    possible that you are not including OT features when you generate the font. There
    is a checkbox for this in the preferences."
