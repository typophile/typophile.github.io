  body: Can't find a perfect match and doubt there could be one with such a /A. For
    what it's worth, if I have to reproduce it, I'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima|Optima]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/condor|Condor]], vertically compress
    it and rework /A top.
