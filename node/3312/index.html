  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Okay so here&#39;s my first go at posting something for critique. I&#39;m somewhat timid about posting anything here for fear of being ripped to shreds, but you don&#39;t learn without some mistakes along the way huh? Anyhow, here are two projects i&#39;ve been playing with &#40;thats what type design is for me. i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to tell!&#41; <BR>The first, Seventies Schoolbook, is based on letterforms that i first saw as a kid in elementary school on some reading textbooks. The second is based on letterforms drawn to illustrate a book called &#34;Aha, Gotcha!&#34; Both are in the very formative stages, but i thought i&#39;d post here to get yer feedback as to whether either of these projects have artistic merit and whether i should spend any more time working on them. Both are missing characters, i&#39;m more concerned about Digitize tho, because the letterforms are all variations of highly stylized numerals, but i haven&#39;t quite figgered out how to manipulate the basic forms to create suitable glyphs for K,P,Q &amp; Y. Anyhow, without further ado...<!--attachment: RoughPass-27238.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*24.1*My+First+Critique+Projects*RoughPass%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">My First Critique Projects<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/RoughPass-27238.pdf" target="_blank"><b>RoughPass.pdf</b></a> (24.1 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--> <BR>Go ahead, be harsh!

		<div class="commentbody">It&#39;s pretty straightforward to make a 2 into Q simply by extending the top bit around until it gets close to the tail. &#40;this works best in handwritings where the 2 is closer to the Devanagari 2 numeral form: <a href="http://omniglot.com/writing/devanagari.htm" target="_blank">http://omniglot.com/writing/devanagari.htm</a> .&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the input, guys. I guess the digits are fairly 80s huh? I guess thats a little bit of nostalgia for me then and with the 80s styles back on the rise... maybe this one will be interesting again &#40;and then again, maybe not&#41; <BR>Darren, i tried to &#34;solve&#34; as many of the glyph issues as i could. I&#39;ll post a sample. Obviously some of my solutions don&#39;t &#34;work&#34; as well as others. <BR><!--attachment: DigitzFull-27288.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*11.3**DigitzFull%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf"><br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/DigitzFull-27288.pdf" target="_blank"><b>DigitzFull.pdf</b></a> (11.3 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--> <BR>One thing i&#39;ve thought about doing with this one is to slightly tweak out the basic letterforms to make them fit each letter better, but i&#39;d want it to be something subtle if i did that. Anyhow, just a few things i&#39;ve been playing with. <BR>Hmmm, a 2 for a Q, why didn&#39;t I think of that??? i&#39;ll see if i can work it with what i&#39;ve got. Then again maybe i&#39;ll play with the forms and really &#34;own&#34; them!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, obviously the Y could use the same glyph of the 4, like you did with the 6/G, and the 2 suggestion by Shreyas is very good. I disagree with Hrant, the whole feeling of Digitize is something way beyond &#34;numbers as letters&#34;, it&#39;s &#34;letters as numbers&#34; as well, and back again. I think it is very intriguing. <BR>Whi don&#39;t you call it &#34;Digitease&#34;, the sound is similar and it could mean Digitize, Digi-tease, and Digit-ease at the same time. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>
