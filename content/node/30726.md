body: "I've been working on this logo for awhile now for a class. I was randomly assigned
  a topic which was measuring devices for cooking, and ended up with the name \"Measure
  of Taste\". \r\n\r\nThe specialty shop is supposed to be in Chicago. My positioning
  statement is, \"For working professionals who love to cook, Measure of Taste sells
  high quality measuring devices for cooking, and our knowledgeable staff will help
  you to find any measuring device you want, even if we have to custom order it\".\r\n\r\nI
  used Univers Thin Ultra Condensed so the logo can be vertically without being too
  tall. I shortened up the length of the increments on the right side too.\r\n\r\nI
  don't really know what else to do on it, does anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\n-Troy"

    all they will notice is 'of'. The eye doesn't like reading from bottom to top
    (it's such hard work...). I also find the chopped 'U' in measure hard to read;
    it could be confused for 'II'.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to suggest; you may need
    to start again from the beginning.\r\n"

  body: "Cutting off the bottoms of the letters causes some problems, especially with
    the 'u' and 'a'. Your unicase solution for 'a' seems out of place. Maybe try all-caps.\r\n\r\nWhy
    are the tick marks on the ruler uneven?\r\n\r\n\"OF\" just gets lost since it's
    in a different colour, font, and orientation to the rest of the text. I thought
    it said \"on\" at first.\r\n\r\nI also do not like the vertical orientation of
    the logo. Usually (at least in Canada) when text is placed vertically (such as
    on the spine of a book or video box) it reads from top-to-bottom, not bottom-to-top.
    I don't know if this would help in your case though.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Well, the reason I put it vertical is because mostly of what my professor
    guided me to do (although I don't agree for the most part), and the tick marks
    are just like the increments on a ruler, that's why they're uneven. And for the
    \"OF\" in between, I made it more horizontal so it was larger and easier to read,
    because if I were to use the same vertical style as the other letters, it would
    be too small and hard to read. I can't really think of any other way to do it,
    does anyone have any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nOh yeah, I tried it in all caps,
    but it's a little more difficult to read like that, at least vertical, but my
    professor doesn't want me to make it horizontal "

  body: You can indeed cut most lowercase typfaces in half, and the top remains legible.
    But you must consider the place where to cut it. On the 'e', for example, if you
    cut below the horizontal stroke, it can also be an 'o'. Some characters will almost
    always give problems, like the 'u' and the 'p'.

    not long like a ruler. \r\n\r\nYou've got the concept of \"measure\" in the logo,
    but where is the \"taste\" (of the mouthwatering kind)? These are cooking tools,
    not laboratory beakers. I'm not sure accuracy and measure needs to be the focus.

    make would be if I'm not mistaken, measuring cups tend to have black and red for
    the tick/increment labels. Maybe try the Measure of Taste in red or just Measure
    & Taste, leaving the of the way it is.
