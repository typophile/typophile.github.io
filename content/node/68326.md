  Headline Sans, but it's clearly not as compressed, a kind of 'fatter'. Anyone know
  what this is? I'd LOVE to buy it!! \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Of course it is, thank you so much Bendy! I last worked with Fedra in a branding
    project for the Hartmannbund, which the company I worked for inherited from an
    excellent art director. I've always since loved it. Thanks for refreshing my memory.
    Gotta add it to my collection now!
