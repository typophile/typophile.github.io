body: "Hello Typophiles.\r\nIt's been a long while since my last post here (so long
  that I originally posted in the wrong place).\r\nIf it's not too much trouble, I'd
  like some feedback on the below logotype (currently in development). The 'e' specifically
  is bothersome.\r\nIt has been some time since I worked on an identity from scratch
  without using existing typefaces and to be honest, I'm a little rusty.\r\n\r\nIt
  will be accompanied by a simple icon (concept also under development) that reflects
  the choice of name for this project. I'll bring that to the fore later in the process.\r\n\r\nOwnership
  isn't an issue as it's completion will mark the long awaited launch of my own creative
  studio. After reading the 'some things to keep in mind...' thread I have no problem
  with openly discussing this within the forum.\r\n\r\nHere goes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Initial
  render of the proposed logotype.</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lode_logotype_dev1_typophile_6664.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>Geometric
  breakdown of proposed logotype.</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lode_logotype_dev2_typophile_6603.png]\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: At first sight, l is a bit light while e (especially in the bottom-right area)
    is a bit heavy.

    Maybe you could try to make the ascender a bit less tall.\r\n\u2022 Maybe you
    could make the horizontal line of the 'e' a bit thinner.\r\n"

  body: I agree with riccard0, the L does look a bit thin, and I would try rounding
    off the very bottom right corner of the E

  body: I'd be tempted, to shorten the tail of the E a bit. Wondering what it would
    look like with the rounded ends taken off the counters.

    based on the above.\r\n\r\n@timaarts\r\nI more than understand what you mean about
    the geometric versus optical.\r\nI think I'll have to find some equilibrium between
    the two and set the base concept up geometrically and then make optical corrections
    to get to the final design. I'm a slave to 'the grid' but clearly this approach
    is not doing me any favours."

  body: "Next phase, then.\r\n\r\nThis one is simply the original with the bottom
    right corner of the 'e' rounded off and the ascenders shortened.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lode_logotype_dev3_typophile_4271.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is an optical adjustment of the 'e' and the ascenders shortened. The height of
    the closed counter has been increased while the open counter remains the same.
    In effect following on from <cite>timaarts</cite>' advice to make the horizontal
    line thinner.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lode_logotype_dev4_typophile_6612.png]\r\n\r\n@Hayes
    Image\r\nI'm working on another version to test your idea of making the tail shorter
    and squaring off the counters."

  body: "@timaarts\r\nThis is what makes this forum so great.\r\nWhat you have done
    with the ascender on the 'd' is very interesting. It actually lends itself well
    to the idea I have for the supporting mark/icon.\r\nWatch this space for the mockup.\r\n\r\nI
    don't mind the length of the ascenders in your version as long as it doesn't begin
    to put the 'l' back on a diet. I agree with the previous comments that the original
    looked a little thin in comparison to the other characters.\r\n\r\nI'll sleep
    on it."
