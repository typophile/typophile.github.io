  the G is narrower and the serifs don't end at a point. please help, i need this
  for a research essay.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/guess_6262.JPG]\r\n\r\nalso,
  if anyone knows of any somewhat popular fashion companies/stores that use the Rockwell
  font in their logo that information would be greatly appriciated. "

  body: not all logos are derived directly from fonts. i'm sure you can find something

  body: I seriously doubt you'll find anything closer than Times. You can find the
    actual logo <a href="http://brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query_id=4482351&page=1&mtype=&brand_id=16024">here</a>.
