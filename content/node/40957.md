  body: 'DejaVu is a derivative of Bitstream Vera, the open source font they did for
    Gnome foundation. The others are likely open source non-latin fonts. '

  body: Yeah I assume they're all open source since it's one of the principals behind
    the laptop. Do we know who designed any of them?

  body: "There's a table at the bottom of [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Fonts|this page]]
    that might answer some of your questions.\r\n\r\nIt's clear from the list of fonts
    that the main goal driving font selection is to support the writing systems of
    the XO's target populations.  Abyssinica SIL is for Ge'ez (Ethiopic); DejaVu handles
    Roman, Greek, and Cyrillic, and may provide partial support for some other scripts;
    Garuda, Loma, Norasi, Purisa, and the Tlwg fonts do Thai; and the Kacst fonts,
    Nafees, and the PakType fonts do Arabic script.\r\n\r\nOf those fonts, I've used
    the DejaVu fonts and Abyssinica SIL.  The DejaVu fonts support a lot of languages,
    which I appreciate; they're not the most attractive fonts in the world, though,
    as you may have noticed.  Abyssinica SIL is a good looking font as far as I can
    tell (I don't read Ge'ez or speak any language that uses it).  No bold or italic,
    but it was plenty good for a few papers on Amharic.  It's developed under the
    auspices of the SIL Non-Roman Script Initiative."

    fonts they mention there aren't on the list a top this thread!

  body: Yeah, I think that from the whole language about Devanagari and Hindi that
    it does, too. But why no properly-delineated font list! Isn't that what a wiki-formated
    webpage should be all about? What if I were asking the same question, but for
    Tamil, or Korean, or Mongolian? Haley's list in the opening thread is not a long
    font list at all. There are more fonts that fit with their values that they could
    have included, I think.

    they have different keyboards for the different regions so that would explain
    why my laptop didn't come with any other language fonts."
