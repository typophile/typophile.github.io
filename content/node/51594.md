body: "some years ago i read (perhaps in a book about paul rand, but i'm not sure)
  of a celebration at which a designer's students presented him with a bent ruler.
  The bent  ruler represented what he had taught them: they should believe their eyes,
  not the ruler's measurements, e.g. in aligning one edge of lines of text some letters
  must overhang to look right. \r\n\r\ni'm writing an article in which i'd like to
  cite that bent-ruler award, but, after searching through many books, i still haven't
  found it.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone recall it, or something similar?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
