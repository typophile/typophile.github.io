  body: ThanX everyone. Much appreciated. Guess I am a little late to the Bickham
    party. I cannot tell if everyone is sick of the font or you all really like it?
    Which is it? I would have to say its a very nice script and I am not big on scripts.

  body: I think the reason you might have detected a &#39;tone&#39; is that Bickham
    is frequently the subject of ID requests. With all its optional characters it
    can confuse people.  <BR> <BR>In answer to your question about whether we like
    it, my answer is that I bought a license for it, but it&#39;s a bit of a pain
    to use fully, because of the gyrations needed to bring up the extra characters.
    Still, the end result is worth the effort. I use Bickham or Zapfino when I want
    flashy-looking scripts with a lot of flourish to them.
