  body: After careful close up looking (both o's are different etc) I think this is
    caligraphy and not a font, i.e. hand done.

  body: "This was a pretty small sample so I looked for more lettering from the end
    credits. Here is a collage of some of what I found.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TangledEndCreditsCollage_3463.jpg]\r\nLots
    of variation in repeating letters. Even a font with many alternates would not
    do this. In my opinion this is definitely hand lettering. My recommendations for
    substitute fonts still seem appropriate.\r\nDon"
