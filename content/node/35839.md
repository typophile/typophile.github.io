body: Greetings all. For several months I have been searching for a proper font to
  ink onto my skin. My intent is to tattoo text int he form of a triskelion (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Wheeled-Triskelion-basic.svg)
  (or something very close to it. I can not seem to find a font that flows well when
  in a circle or a curve. I am looking for guidance as tot he types of fonts I should
  inquire about as well as specific font suggestions if you have them. The text will
  be written in Albanian, which uses a modified Latin alphabet. Thank you in advance
  for your help.

    your needs as-is.  You might start with the letter shapes from a font, but they
    will have to be customized to fit the curves.\r\n\r\nIf it isn't too much trouble,
    could you share a rough sketch of your tattoo, lettering only for positioning
    and not style? Also, please translate what the words mean. This should give us
    more to go on in thinking up suggestions."

  body: Just a passive observation, unless you're going to get it covering your back,
    or a large area, the letters will spread together if they're done small. It'll
    make it hard to read if the lettering is too small or doesn't allow for generous
    white space.
