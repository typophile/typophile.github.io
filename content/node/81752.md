  at the entrance to the build I work in, but nobody seems to know anything about
  it!

    letters.\r\n\r\nOffhand I don't recognize this, but if these are engraved on the
    building, there is really no reason to assume they are a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sorry, I should have said - it's not engraved, it's a large sticker on glass.
    It's also part of our logo, which is where I clipped the text from. I'm fairly
    sure it exists as a font. I like the combination of geometric characters and typewriter
    like serifs. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_for_upload_4904.png]"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestion Chris, and I see what you mean. I thought maybe
    it was Typ1451 - it has the right a's, but the i's are wrong. Replica and Replica
    Mono also look close, but have the wrong a. I like the Lineto style though.\r\n\r\nHere's
    what I've figured out by staring at lots of possibilities (I'm no typeface expert!).
    The a's make this typeface pretty distinctive - this style seems to be used much
    more commonly in italics. That big sweeping round C on the beginning also stands
    out. Then there are the serifs on the I, i and l, and the shape of the apostrophe.
    It's a funny old mix, when I try to dissect it."

  body: "That style of 'a', along with the circular 'C' are characteristic of a kind
    of geometric typefaces of which the most known is Futura. The serifs on 'I', 'i'
    and 'l' (and the narrow 'm') are typical of monospaced fonts.\r\nUnfortunately,
    the monospaced version of Futura I found (http://www.fontmenu.com/site/_Normafixed.html)
    isn\u2019t the right one.\r\n\r\nBut it could be Avant Garde Mono (http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsnerflake/itc_avant_garde_mono_tu_bold/)\r\n\r\nor

  body: "The prize goes to James - it is indeed Optimo Hermes Regular - thank you
    and well spotted.\r\n\r\nThanks also to Riccad0 for pointing me in the right direction.
    I've learned a little more, discovered I have a soft spot for geometric typefaces,
    and found a ton of new typefaces I like.\r\n\r\nIs there something I should do
    to mark this thread solved?"
