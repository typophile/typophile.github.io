  I would really appreciate the tips. \r\nKerning is still non-existent at this point
  (sorry it is so squished) but I love some of the letters, so hopefully I can make
  it cohesive!"

  body: Would be better if weight of all curls was equal and that the degree of slant
    in letters was similiar.

  body: "Thanks for taking a look at my font! I will definitely make some adjustments.
    \r\nAre the differences in stroke weight very distracting also? "

  body: 'I think this would be stronger if you began again and focused on the letters
    themselves a bit more. The core shapes are not as strong as they should be yet.
    With ''a'' you have more energy but by z your focus is weakening. The C is too
    heavy compared to the rest. Mostly though this face has a bit to much curl in
    it. The curls should be used to help the letters be more what they are or be natural
    extensions on the forms - your r does this. Part of the t seems natural - at the
    bottom. But the one on the top makes the t look less like a t. It''s in the way.
    The t doesn''t need the curl at the top or benefit from it. So I would get rid
    of it.  I would go through the whole thing & ask yourself. Is this curl needed
    here? Is it helping? Or in the way? Also,maybe not all the letters need curls. '
