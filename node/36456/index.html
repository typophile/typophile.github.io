<p>I had spiced things a bit with 514.123.4567 in a new design, but Noooooo I am not allowed to present phone numbers that way in the French version of the booklet because we follow the rules of the Office de la langue française, and <em>they</em> say phone numbers must not be presented any other way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so annoyed with this. It&rsquo;s stupid, it&rsquo;s silly, but where is the boundary between language and design? I understand language-specific punctuation and hyphenation etc&hellip;  it&rsquo;s necessary. But phone numbers?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It reminds me of a job I had once&hellip;</p>
<p>I had a really fabulous assignment to design one of those educational &ldquo;wall charts&rdquo; for a national laboratory &ndash; you know, those dense things that are hanging on the wall of your science class in high school? The design process unfortunately included regular meetings with a large group of government bureaucrats and scientists. One day, well into the project, the panel ganged up on me to insist I change the typeface used throughout (Myriad MM) to some kind of font with serifs, because &ldquo;fonts with serifs are more readable.&rdquo; Despite the fact that the overall design required a wide range of weights and widths, and consisted mostly of short text passages, I could not dissuade them from the idea that &ldquo;serifs are always better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Somewhat fortunately, soon after, I was forced out of my job through a spectacular political showdown that gave me the rare opportunity to tell a particularly odious bureaucrat, to their face, &ldquo;Well then I will just have to quit!&rdquo; Ah, the memories. Someone else finished the wall chart.)</p>

<p>My beef is that I just don&rsquo;t see how this is a language issue. To me it&rsquo;s a style preference. You don&rsquo;t like it? I&rsquo;m cool with that.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My not-very-expert opinion is that in design very little boils down to &ldquo;rules&rdquo;. Most of it is personal preference and consensus.</p>
<p>Tried and true reigns at this institution &ndash; or I should say unquestioned tradition. And I can deal with it. Most of the time. I nod and smile and bite my tongue, but lately I&rsquo;ve been wanting better answers for why we do things a certain way. &ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ve always done it that way&rdquo; is just not very convincing.</p>
<p>We now have one style for phone numbers in English text and one style for phone numbers in French text. This confuses me (why??????) and makes more work for me.</p>
<p>I changed all the French to what the translation department wanted. The English have already gone off to print, and so they won&rsquo;t get changed from the (514) 123-4567 format to the 514-123-4567 that our marketing communications department wants. Too bad, but I&rsquo;m not sure I really care that much.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t have CS3. I have CS2. :(</p>
<p>I was having a very frustrating day, and I don&rsquo;t know any better place to come for understanding and venting than here. You guys get me through the day sometimes!</p>
<p>I have had a very frustrating couple of months. I&rsquo;ve often wondered if I&rsquo;m becoming a monkey who knows the software instead of a designer and editor who just might possibly know a little bit more about the job than administrative secretaries and assistants. The phone numbers are not important. They were just the proverbial cherry.</p>
<p>Some days I want to clean houses for rich families in Westmount. The salary would be about the same. I&rsquo;d be following orders. I&rsquo;m detail-oriented&ndash;I can polish silverware. The main difference is I wouldn&rsquo;t feel that my skills and knowledge were being crushed, or worse, ignored. And I&rsquo;d have dry hands and broken nails instead of bad eyes and back pain.</p>
<p>Whaddyall think? Time for a career change?</p>
