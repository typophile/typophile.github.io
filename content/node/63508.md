  to be able to categorize it. I've identifonted it and WTF (What the font) to no
  avail. Any help would be much appreciated.

  body: Thank you micro. Of all the places to find a font... the free market is the
    one that never gets official standing for some reason.

  body: "Sure. Glad to help.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean by <em>official standing</em>,
    but I can assure you that Jos Buivenga (the designer of this free font) is (recently)
    enormously popular and has some other excellent faces available for free and at
    a reasonable cost through MyFonts and maybe other vendors, as well. He has created
    a brilliant business model. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/200909.html\">You
    can read more about him here.</a>\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"
