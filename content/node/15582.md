    a precedent of expectation\r\nover the years, revealing the following might be

    every thread. I will certainly follow threads that I've\r\nposted in (thanks to
    the \"my recent posts\" tracker) and will\r\nregularly scan the tracker for potentially
    interesting threads,\r\nbut please don't expect to fling things like \"hey Hrant
    what do\r\nyou think?\" or \"hah, that sounds like hhp's dog\" randomly in\r\nthe
    air and promptly get my once-typical Pavlovian reaction.\r\nSo: you're not at
    all rid of me, but my ears are much busier now.\r\n\r\nAnd if you happen to be

    quotation (I will edit it). \r\n\r\nThe only reference I can find to the crown
    weighs heavy is this in the last stanza of a poem about oppression (presumably
    from South Africa), I am certain it is older than that but cannot track down any
    reference and my poor old brain won't cooperate.\r\n\r\nThis crown weighs heavy
    on my head\r\nHeavy on my soul\r\nThis crown overshadows the love in my heart\r\nIt
    overpowers the light from my face\r\nMy royal heritage\r\nMy royal feast\r\n\r\nMy
    favourite quote about thrones is from Rudyard Kipling (too easily written off
    as an apologist for Empire)\r\nDown to Gehenna or up to the Throne,\r\nHe travels
    the fastest who travels alone.\r\n<em>Rudyard Kipling 1865-1936: The Story of
