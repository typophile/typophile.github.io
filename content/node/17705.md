    wonder which gargantuan corporation will read this as such and eat them up as
    adobe ate up macromedia...\r\n\r\nbut i must say i'm a pretty happy camper with
    cs2 overall."

  body: I'm waiting for CS3, since its only taking 18 months to develop the next version.
    And if I right the last version (CS2) was released last April which would make
    November a release date for CS3

  body: "The problem is that this 18-months-cycles are quite marketing driven. I wonder
    if Adobe says \"we want these features for CS3, until when can they be ready?\"
    or if they say \"it needs to be realeased in November 2006, let's have a look
    what features we can implement until then\".\r\nFor the customer, second one would
    be better, as it is feature focused, not time focused. Looking at CS2, which is
    quite good already, there is no need for hurrying to version CS3, except for marketing
    reasons."
