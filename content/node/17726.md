  1020 LaserJet</a>. it is the most inexpensive laser printer i've been able to find
  and i like the fact that i can purchase it directly from HP (as opposed to some
  of the other not-so-legitimate sources that are out there)\r\n\r\nat this point
  i don't have the funds to buy a super high quality laser printer but i just want
  to make sure it will work for the purpose of proofing type. if anyone would have
  any input or suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\nnick

    as you don''t expect to do anything more than check spacing, overall color and
    alignment of your typefaces, it will work fine. Just don''t expect the printer
    to accurately reflect the subtleties of your outlines: you''ll need a Postscript
    printer for that, and you''re going to have to pay eight to ten times as much
    to get a true Postscript printer.'

    perhaps that is so only when compared to Postscript printers?\r\n\r\n---------------\r\nnc\r\n"

    it's definitely <em>faster</em> than the inkjet your have, regardless of make
    or model."

  body: "Actually, I have an HP 1200, and I think it does better than you'd expect
    for such a low price. For one, It seems to have true 1200 dpi resolution, which
    is pretty important for type. For two, it has a lot less gain than other lasers
    I've tried. I <em>think</em> the 1020 has the same engine, but it's hard to be
    sure.\r\n\r\nLaser vs inkjet is harder to quantify. Both distort type considerably,
    but inkjets have gotten a lot better in recent years. One real advantage of lasers
    is that they work on plain papers. To proof type on an inkjet, you have to use
    glossy. It also helps to set a very high resolution and unidirectional printing
    in the driver (both of which slow down the printing quite a bit).\r\n\r\nI am
    very pleased with my Epson 2200. In the letter-size category, the R800 ($400 MSRP)
    has similar specs. I wouldn't be surprised if the R220 ($99 MSRP) produces adequate
    results as well. It has a bigger drop size (3 pl vs 1.5 for the R800) and dye
    based inks (so they'll fade), but the low end Epsons are pretty amazing for their
    price.\r\n\r\nProbably the single biggest thing you have to worry about is gain.
    If you have a high-gain printer and design your type to look good there, then
    it will be really weak and anemic when printed offset.\r\n\r\nSee also this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/16926\r\n"

  body: "LJ 1020 for proofing type: a clear no!\r\n\r\nThe datasheet PDF -- just google
    the for the printer model and select the hp site -- says: \"Resolution: 1200 dpi
    effective output quality\" which has a footnote: \"600 x 600 dpi with HP REt and
    FastRes 1200 technology\". Which is not <strong>real</strong> 1200 dpi.\r\n\r\nAlways
    be cautious with notions like \"1200 dpi <strong>quality</strong>\", regardless
    of brand. Same with Xerox or IBM.\r\n\r\nI bought a LJ 1320 recently which gives
    good results at little costs. True 1200 dpi and double side printing which I haven't
    tried yet. (But my impression is that the printing of the 1200 was a bit finer.
    And the quality of the 2100 is still unmatched.)\r\n\r\nKarsten\r\n"

    print fonts out of illustrator. when i send the illustrator file to print, it
    just prints a bunch of symbols at the top of the page(!?!!?)\r\n\r\nhas anyone
    experienced this problem? could it be a Postscript related problem? or perhaps
    it's an operator error??\r\n\r\n---------\r\nnc"

    ascii from Illustrator. Check the \"options\" in the graphics panel of the print
    dialogue, and check to see which PPD Illustrator is picking up.\r\n\r\nSwitching
    to a different print driver and back to the LJ 1320 might be enough to sort out
