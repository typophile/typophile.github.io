  body: "it's too devolved to be simply times 'whatever', it's a typeset block from
    long time ago. you can get the same look with ursa or gentium printed (not photocopied)
    on a rough paper, high cotton content or laid stock.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled

  body: "I'm curious to know more about the sample. Is it actual (metal) type, and
    how old is it? If you have samples of other letters it might be possible to give
    a more definite ID.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
