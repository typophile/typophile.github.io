  could really use some extras, it's Gentium.\r\n\r\nFirst, Gentium is one of the
  few (precious few) free typefaces that really stands up well against large commercial
  type families. It was built for scholars, it seems, with extensive language support.
  There are others, such as Cardo, for example. But none seem to approximate Gentium's
  special quality. Not only that, but Gentium is a study in readability and solid
  design. The sample pdf gives the distinct impression that Gentium was no small undertaking.
  Imagine how well small caps and old style numerals would complement the roman and
  italic. \r\n\r\nWe have a new Gentium book weight as well, which of course might
  presage all of the above. \r\n\r\nSo, my thanks to Victor Gaultney. And here's hoping
  there's a lot more in store for Gentium and what appears to be its sans companion,
  Andika."

  body: "Believe me, I agree that Gentium could use some enhanced typographic features.
    :-) We're working on it, but balancing it with other projects has been difficult.
    I can tell you, however, that the small caps are done for the regular and italic
    - not a small undertaking when you have literally hundreds of capitals to turn
    into small caps. There are a lot of other new things, but no old style figures.
    We hope to have a final release out mid-year, with betas before then. We're getting
    close!\r\n\r\n(BTW - this is only for Gentium Regular and Gentium Italic, not
    the additional book and bold weights.)"

    for old-style figures, they aren't always a necessity - I agree, but small caps
    would really enhance the family. Nice to hear that progress is being made."

  body: "As someone who only sets books, printed offset at 2400+ dpi using direct-to-plate
    workflow, I really lament the lack of work on Gentium Book. Gentium Regular is
    fine for laser printers, but a bit too light for bookwork.\r\n\r\nIn contrast,
    I did cut oldstyle figures for Charis, and am using it for some projects. For
    those who need a neutral font with a tremendous number of special characters (but
    not Greek), Charis is a very useful font."
