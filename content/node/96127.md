    Do you need this to be legible and readable? I might suggest that those aspects
    can be essential for branding. \r\nThe two different terminals on the top and
    bottom don't seem resolved to me. \r\n\r\np.s. I did something surprisingly similar
    a while ago that you might have seen: http://www.behance.net/gallery/Cream-List/1360679"

  body: "thanks herb and Luma,\r\n\r\nAs for the flourish I'll shorten that out. \r\n\r\nHerb:
    Yeah I thought about recurving that C.  the original concept had a C-5 r-5 ligature.
    The I  split the C at the end which I think was a bad idea. \r\n\r\n Luma: No
    I hadn't seen that one of yours and it's a nice approach but yours is more of
    a calligraphy style and mine's a bit more rounded. \r\n\r\nThanks for the insight.
    Let me try what you guys suggested."

  body: "The most obvious problem (which I'm surprised nobody has pointed out yet)
    is that there's no way this will be read as \"Cream5\". In fact there seems no
    logical/predictable way to read that \"5\".\r\n\r\nI know it's tempting to \"show
    off\" by splicing a numeral into a word (even if some people would accuse you
    of reviving a 90s motif) but if you want it to actually work one direct way would
    be to make the end flourish form the \"5\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    seems like a nifty idea that just isn't working and is interfering with the niceness
    of the 'Cream'. "

  body: "Hi hrant, thanks for the critique. I see what you mean by it wont be read
    literally as \"cream5\".  The thing is it was a play on C5 and Cream5.   As for
    the accusations of it being a 90s motif, I'm not sure what you mean though.\r\n\r\nI
    didn't understand the bit about making the end flourish from the 5. Do you mean
    connect the bottom flourish  to the bottom half of 5? That's an interesting idea
    if that's what you mean though :D\r\n\r\naluminum, well I really want to incorporate
    the 5 into it. "

    from IRC for the most part. Having been an IRCer for yrs until couple yrs ago
    i stopped, i kinda know what l33t speak is.  In l337 speak 5 would be constituted
    as an S and not an r or an F.  \r\n Frankly I'm not trying to force anything into
    the design though.  Your idea of using the flourish from the M making up a 5 is
    almost like less interesting, I'm sorry.  Why even bother? Might as well just
    type out a 5 at the end and be over with :)\r\n \r\nI don't mean to be extremely
    rude here or anything but in my original post, I sort of did mention that I was
    only looking for critique on the typography elements such as kerning, etc, and
    not the original design. Although herb and Luma suggested a few things that doesn't
    change the original design and therefore I've considered that.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: "Well, I guess it can't say \"C5\" <em>and</em> \"Cream5\" - you'll have to
    settle on one. \r\n\r\nWhat I meant about the flourish bit is that the swirls
    coming out of the \"m\" could make a \"5\". Like as it stands it's almost saying
    \"3\" already.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>being a 90s motif, I'm not sure what you mean</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBetween
    a decade and two ago splicing numbers into text (like \"5ive\") was a hip thing
    to do. See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet\r\n\r\nBTW, once in a blue
    moon gradation actually makes sense* so you might consider it for delimiting \"Cream\"
    and \"5\" somehow.\r\n\r\n* http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4231414343\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Really like the concept and the way you've introduced the '5'!\r\n\r\nI might
    tighten up the spacing between the C and the r/5 - possibly by re-curving the
    C so that it doesn't stick out so much to the left and maybe goes OVER the r/5
    a bit.\r\n\r\nAlso, my first impression was that it said Creamz. The flourish
    looks very much like an alphabetic extension of the word. Eliminating the loop
    could avoid such an issue.\r\n \r\n- Herb\r\n\r\n"

    (not \"typography\", BTW) to me the \"5ream\" seems decent* but the \"C\" and
    top flourish seem particularly malformed.\r\n\r\n* Although the eye of the \"e\"
    is too small.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I changed it to this.  Not entirely sure of the colors yet and the other final
    touchups such as possibly adding a gradient and highlights to it like hrant mentioned.
    \ I might throw in a second concept using the 5 at the end as hrant mentioned
    only that i'll try to  incorporate into the m and see how that goes and compare
    the two and finalise on it.  THanks again! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cream5_5645.1.png]"
