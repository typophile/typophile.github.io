In type design the only rivalry I've really gleaned is between Americans and Europeans - but you have to pay very careful attention to smell it. <BR> <BR>BTW, I recently learned that if you're a graphic designer in Mexico, you better be from Tijuana if you want max peer respect. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Seems like there would be at least something, given the fact that different interests have based themselves on the two coasts (at least in my mind)&ndash;East coast:  book publishing, West coast:  entertainment/computer industry. <BR> <BR>Is the Tijuana thing true?  Several years ago I lived in a region in Mexico (Oaxaca) that was about as far geographically and culturally from Tijuana as one could get; now I've never been to Tijuana, but every sign and work of graphic design in Oaxaca seemed as if it were in emulation of something in Tijuana (or the pictures I've seen anyway).

		<div class="commentbody">Paul Renner (c.1950), translated by Chris Burke in his &quot;Paul Renner&quot;: <BR> <BR>&quot;The truly Modern, that is, the undistorted expression of an objective Zeitgeist, is only what we hold today to be timelessly perfect. This is not the same in all periods, because the insight into the timelessly valid changes from generation to generation&quot; <BR> <BR>and <BR> <BR>&quot;For the Modern is an idea, an unending task, never to be entirely resolved. We seek it on a narrow ridge, which drops away on one side into thoughtlessly adopted convention and on the other side into the Modish, which is mostly a somewhat foppish exaggeration of the Modern at any one time. this ridge is no comfortable middle way.&quot; <BR> <BR>I would have thought this understanding of the Modern would be sympathetic to you, Hrant, rather than demonizing Modernism as a banal &quot;fitted to the grid&quot;. <BR> <BR>But surely there are Modernists, Traditionalists, post-Modernists, post-traditionalist, etc., all over the geographical compass, and most designers don't categorize themselves in these or any terms, we just do it. <BR> <BR>And if we do categorize, is it by which side of the country we live on, by which side of the bed we sleep on, or somewhere in between?

Interesting. <BR> <BR>Forgot to address that. It's the other way around actually. Oaxaca is one of the oldest and more culturally important cities in Mexico. Some of the finest artists and craftsmen live and work there. Tijuana, having the identity crisis that it has, borrows a lot from Mexico's vernacular which is born in &quot;more Mexican&quot; cities like Oaxaca or even Mexico City.  <BR> <BR>Equally though, Tijuana has one of the most visuallly- and linguistically-intriguing vernaculars.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Having lived and worked in Italy, Switzerland and on both coasts &ndash; Cape Cod and Sonoma County &ndash; I think westerners mistrust any guy who wears chinos instead of jeans. I found designers and illustrators in Milan to be the most fun to be among, but then we were all young. In and around the Boston-Cambridge area I found illustrators to be very open and helpful whereas designers were uptight almost to a man. (Note that I did not say woman. ) It might be that we were all that much older and competitive. Yes, it's generalizing, and I'm guilty as charged.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Gerald. I'm just beginning to put together a blog about my 25 years of Polaroid corporate ID and product image at: <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/" target="_blank"><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/">http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/</a></a> <BR>It will cover the important years 1957 through 1977 and I will describe the behind-the-scenes efforts to get such projects accomplished within a corporate environment, such as beating off the MBAs who had read a book or two about point of purchase.</div>
