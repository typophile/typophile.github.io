body: I&#39;m currently teaching English in China, and as part of a series of lectures
  on &#39;ideas that changed how the western world thinks&#39;, I&#39;m working on
  one about the invention of movable type.  What I can&#39;t find &#40;in English
  anyway&#41; is the history of the use of this technology in China.  If anyone has
  any pertinant information &#40;when, where, size of collections, distribution, etc...&#41;
  please help. <BR>I am intentionally avoiding using the term &#34;printing press&#34;
  as there is some dispute here as to when and where it was invented.

  body: There are about 4 paragraphs about the invention of movable type in China
    in Philip Meggs&#39; <i>A History of Graphic Design</i>. I&#39;m on my way out
    right now, but I can type them &amp; send them to you tomorrow if they&#39;d be
    helpful. If you have access to the book, I believe chapter 2 deals with Asia.
    IIRC, Pi Sheng was a Chinese chemist and invented movable type during the middle
    of the 11th century.

    Rather, these seem to be independent inventions.

    invented was a combination of processes and materials: he found a way to cast
    metal type with precision and in quantity; he found an ink that would stick to
    metal &#40;as Chinese ink could not&#41;; he contrived a &#34;chase&#34; to hold
    the letters to provide the tremendous pressure the sticky ink needed; he devised
    a way to deliver the printing stock &#40;paper&#41; without smudging, and to allow
    &#34;register&#34; or uniform placement of each sheet. All of these things had
    to be accomplished--and put together--before the new kind of printing could be
    done. ...Furthermore, he did it at the time... when there was enough demand for
    printing to motivate moneyed men to invest in the work and materials. '

    catalog in 2000 titled _Printing in the Edo Period: Ieyasu: Typographic Man_.
    This is still in print and available from them. <BR> <BR>It was essentially put
    together to counter Western claims and does a very good job of it. Chinese, Japanese,
    and Korean methods of casting letterforms are thoroughly examined. Photographs
    reveal the casting molds, cast characters, etc. <BR> <BR>Many earlier cultures
    cast coins and medallions and the similar in like molds. As did the Europeans.
    It just never occurred to the latter to make the leap. But when they did they
    had several great advantages over those that gone before:  very advanced and progressive
    &#34;mechanics&#34; &#40;the idea, not the job description!!!&#41;, manufactured
    interchangable parts and tools &#40;and the marketing for it&#41;, an intense
    knowledge of metallurgy &#40;thanks to the alchemists&#41;, and, of course, a
    very easily reproducable letterform &#40;that of the textura&#41; and a written

    <BR>Stamping and casting techniques go back as far as the beginnings of written

    roads traveled were clearly separated and seem not to have crossed. The techniques
    of writing and those that would have allowed the exact reproduction of letterform
    &#40;with some exception, such as the Phaistos stone&#41; were ideas not put together

    on previous ocean expeditions it was clear to earlier navigators that a land mass
    must have existed right where Columbus found it. There were &#34;speculative&#34;
    maps of such available to Columbus. He, in fact, used them, deceivingly, to deliberately
    reduce his supply request to get approval for financing. He knew approximately

  body: William <BR> <BR>Yes, I believe that would be correct. But just as popular
    history distorts the reality of &#34;the invention of printing,&#34; so to it
    may have distorted the identity of the &#34;inventor&#34; as well. <BR> <BR>We
    only really know, from any documented evidence, that Gutenberg was involved in
    various projects &#40;that somehow involved the idea of printing&#41; for some
    twenty years before the publication of the Bible. It is assumed from these that
    he did come up with the adjustable type casting mold. And it can be assumed, from
    the legal documentation regarding the contracting of the Bible, that he had something
    to do with outfitting the presses and assembling the preliminary materials necessary
    for the printing of it. Nothing much more than that. <BR> <BR>Likely there were
    several people working on the similar idea of producing a form of mechanical writing.
    There are unidentifiable artifacts &#40;experiments?&#41; in existence. In regard
    to the Bible itself, the significant contributions of Fust and, particularly,
    Schoeffer &#40;a trained copyist&#41; seem to have been driven down by popular
    history. Yet the book is so perfect in its production that it seems a bit odd
    that a mechanical wizard would be attributed to its printing when the ability
    to design a highly sophisticated typeface, and develop the composition for a book
    would likely have been beyond his skill and knowledge. Renaissance man or no,
    there is just so much one can master. The previous and later printing that can
    be conceivably &#34;attributed&#34; to Gutenberg, bear none of the hallmarks of
    the Bible printing &#40;with the exception of the unique ink formulation&#41;.

  body: 'If Gutenberg can be credited with a novel invention -- not a new concept,

    of some kind must have existed in Asia, but I&#39;ve never seen one or a picture
    of one. Indeed, pictures of European moulds are very few in number, and only a
    handful of later renaissance examples survive. So rare is their depiction in illustrations
    of the type making process that it is assumed that, like the equally rare counterpunches,
    the moulds were a trade secret. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen the <i>Diamond Sutra</i>
    several times, and it is very beautiful, but certainly not as well printed as
    Gutenberg&#39;s 42-line Bible. The use of the term &#39;perfected&#39; in describing

  body: John <BR> <BR>When did the Frankfurt bookfairs begin? <BR> <BR>Aldus was a
    bit more than that though... He also made smaller sized books for a speculative
    market, printed in languages other than Latin, introduced a slew of informational
    design elements &#40;most of which are standard in books today&#41;, begin printing
    classical Greek works, scientific materials, etc. He is actually considered the
    first of the scholar-printers.  <BR> <BR>Much of the earlier incunabula was commissioned
    or directed at an existant and clearly defined market. Don&#39;t know that this
    makes much of a definitional distinction. But I recall that the 42-line Bible
    itself might have been a commission of the Church; as it seems to have been financed
    by it and most copies were dispersed to various elements of the Church upon completion
    of the project. I know there were copies available for sale to the established
    book market though as Fust apparently died of the Black Plague on a selling trip.
    <BR> <BR>I guess this could or could not lend some credance to the idea of it
    being a publishing venture of sorts. Though one can easily say that even the wood
    block playing card printers, who existed for some great long time prior to Gutenberg,
    could be considered publishers. <BR> <BR>Gerald

    first Frankfurt bookfair was, but I remember being struck in a book I was reading
    by the fact that within Gutenberg&#39;s own lifetime this recognisable publishing
    industry was in place. Most likely it was, as you suggest, built on top of a pre-existing
    market for manuscript books, and perhaps the Frankfurst fair existed in some form
    <i>before</i> the early printer-publishers began travelling across Europe both
    selling their books and buying manuscripts for new ones. I didn&#39;t claim that
    Fust &amp; Schoeffer were the first publishers: I said that they appear to have
