    ST. INGBERT, Germany, <a href=\"mailto:info@key-systems.net\">info@key-systems.net</a>)

    a side effect: surely finding names and e-mail addresses mentioned in a thread

  body: "<blockquote>But you can't fight bots with humans.\r\n\r\nhhp</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTechnically
    speaking you're right. But, you can contain it, and then nuke it! Also, setting
    a time limit between posts really helps to slow down bots. Another technique I'd
    like to try is to run a duplicate site where content is automatically up loaded
    to a replica site off-line. So when bots strike simply upload a copy of the replica
    site.\r\n\r\nBlocking whole blocks of IPs gets out of hand, and dynamic IPs come
    with the territory, so vigilance is our most effective weapon.\r\n\r\nn.\r\n"

    spam on the site right now that we aren't addressing, post the link here and watch
    it and the spammer disappear.</cite>\r\n\r\n\u2026 sounds like a strange suggestion.
    \r\nIf I click \xBBtrack\xAB in my account and have 15 threads with new content
    and then read each of them, just to find out all 15 new posts are spam, this just
    doesn't work anymore. And reporting these 15 threads each and every day is no
    solution. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to migrate that old system to a \u201Creal\u201D
    full-fledged discussion board software, which comes with tons of options to fight
    spam. \r\nOr they can be as simple as: New users would be added to a \"validating
    group\" until they have a certain amount of approved post. Before that, their
    posts will have to be manually approved by a moderator. Hardly any spam would
    come thru this way \u2026\r\n"

    All existing spam will be cleaned up in a matter of days. All new spam will be

  body: "Definitely a significant improvement. I\u2019ve gone from hours a day to
    minutes a week cleaning up after those damn bots. We still have a few sleepers,
    and I have seen a few slip through since implementation, but I\u2019d estimate
    a 99% decrease. Let us know if you see any suspicious activity.\r\n\r\nWe all
    owe Jared a  <strong> BIG </strong>  thanks for this one. I\u2019m sure a comment,
    \ tweet, or short email would be appreciated. Everyone likes a little positive
    reinforcement from time to time.\r\n\r\nThanks for commenting."

  body: "Indeed, a well deserved pat on Jared's back.\r\n\r\nThe spam got out of control
    at an astonishing rate. There always were the odd single attacks, but it seemed
    that somewhere the past year some threshold was crossed and Typophile got upped
    on the list of Your Friendly Consumer Reminders. Was there a jump in Typophile's
    Google ratings, or something similar? Or is it just that every <em>serious</em>
    site has so much anti-spam protection, so now they need to focus on your average
    borderline interest groups?\r\n\r\n\"Recession strikes in Spam Industry - Spokesman
    calls for action\" -- hah, sounds like an Onion headline!"

  body: "I believe its a manifestation of bots getting better at hacking standard
    CMS spam protection plugins. Don\u2019t think it takes that much work to download
    the top 10 and hack them. Next step is to do sneaky customization and mods to
    logically trick them. I\u2019ve spoken with Jared, and h\u2019s pulled some very
    clever modification tricks to the new filtering systems that I would never have
    thought of. It\u2019s a matter of outsmarting now. Not out-coding."
