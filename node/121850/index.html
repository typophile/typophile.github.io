  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi!
I’m new here (though I’ve nosed around earlier). 
I’m working on a graphic novel, or actually it’s more like a ‘graphic bio’ – a biography in the form of a picture book.</p>
<p>In the book, there are 3-4 different kinds/lines of text  – the narrator’s voice, my main character’s voice – and then excerpts from letters, song texts and poems, written for and by my main character.
The 3 different kinds of text change a lot throughout the book, so that I sometimes will have all three kinds on one page or spread. Every page is illustrated and sometimes text is set on top of a drawing.</p>
<p>The two first kinds of text, the narrator and my main character, I think would work with quite many different typefaces, 
My story takes place mostly in the 1960-1980s, when my character was young – in a  beatnik-/alternative surrounding. I’d like the typeface for her and the narrator’s voice to have some warmth, but without attracting too much attention to itself. Maybe slightly handwritten and/or casual.
For now, I am leaning towards Cronos, and earlier I’ve looked at Joanna, Perpetua or Legacy Sans.</p>
<p>But, but, but: the letter/poem-texts are causing me a head ache! The only thing that I think really works for them, is using a “oldschool-typewriter”-face (like “Pitch”.) One with a vintage-typewriter-feel.
But I don&rsquo;t think the typewriter-face doesn&rsquo;t mix very well with any of the above mentioned. The shapes, perhaps, but also when  combined with a typewriter face, they look a little (too) formal.
I looked at Nexus and Eureka, which both have a monotype-version, that I thought of using in stead of vintage- typewriter-type, but I think those monotypes look too contemporary for my book. Sigh.</p>
<p>Does this make sense? Do you have any ideas or suggestions?</p>
<p>I know this is the kind of thing you should discuss with a colleague, while having a coffee – but I don’t have that person right now. So – if anyone has thoughts,  opinions or suggestions on this, it will be very much appreciated! Thanks so much!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It depends on how much “graphic” and how much “novel” the result: if the typewritten text is visually framed, it shouldn’t clash with the rest.
If that is the case, I would go for an accurate rendition either historically  (which model of typewriter?) and/or visually (a “worn out” face, like <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/trixie)">http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/trixie)</a>.
If the lines (pun intended) between the different kind of text are more blurred, you could use either a classic text face with a monospaced cut (like Century) or a proportionally spaced typewriter face (like the ones suggested in the aforelinked thread or <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lekton)">http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lekton)</a>.
About the text faces you mention, I’m most familiar with Perpetua, and I wouldn’t recommend it, finding it a bit “frail” and maybe even pretentious.</div>

<p>Would a beatnik be using a typewriter? I was a young person back then and most young folks didn&rsquo;t use them except maybe in upper-class schools, for college term papers, and office work. And it&rsquo;s harder to imagine a beatnik or hippie using one. You might need to include an explanation of why they are using it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you very much for your answers and for pointing me to the older typewriter-discussion. I&rsquo;ll take a closer look at Triplicate.</p>
<p>@ James: they did use typewriters – but also a lot of handwriting. I&rsquo;m reluctant to post text and illustrations from the book, as it is not yet approved, but I can share with you a little piece of sixties typewriting: several little notes like this one,  &ldquo;just left - will be back later&rdquo;-sort of notes, survived all these years and I feature some of them in the book. They feels like text messages from 50 years ago.
@ riccard0: yes. The lines are blurred – and the texts not always visually separated. Century – that might work!</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>I agree. I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s not like today when everyone has a computer. Many folks didn&rsquo;t even own a typewriter. I was the editor of a newsletter in the 1970s and almost all submissions were handwritten.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that typewriting is a bad idea. I&rsquo;m just saying that you might want to mention why a beatnik is using one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">@ James, they did a lot of writing in her &ldquo;group&rdquo;. They published a magazine.
And both her parents were writers. You mentioned social class, and when they met in the 1940, her mother, who came from a middle class family, owned a typewriter, while her father, coming from a working class background, didn&rsquo;t. Her&rsquo;s was an Erica/Erika – I know that.
@ Nick –  I like it Brown. It&rsquo;s has this slight vintage-tint.  I like it. And nice story about WEC. 
It&rsquo;s hard to make the  typewriter-/monospace/slab work with a serif, so I think it must be a sans. Brown could mix nicely, I think. If anything, perhaps I could use something a little more &hellip;casual, perhaps. But it is a good suggestion.</div>
