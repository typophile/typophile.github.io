body: "Finally, I've launched my personal web-site (http://totocaster.com).  I wanted
  it to be super light, simple, focused on front page and to have great typography
  and readability without any non-web-standard font. I've used only three fonts from
  which only 2 are used mainly, those are Georgia and Helvetica (Neue for ultralights),
  for super small texts and photo descriptions I've used Apple standard Lucida Grande
  which looks perfect form me when used in a very small size.\r\n\r\nAll major browsers
  are supported except IE, best viewed in Safari. Sorry Windows users of Internet
  Explorer, text shadows are not supported by your browsers yet, and typography looks
  ugly if you have turned off screen smoothing. \r\n\r\nShare your thoughts, what
  could be done better? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

    don\u2019t merge well with the right navigation. I suspect it's also because of
    the uneven use of whitespace.\r\n(also you may want to update your favicon)"

  body: "I have the habit to click the main logotype in order to return to the front
    page, but in your site I have to click that little \"back\" image next to the
    logotype. That's uncomfortable, IMHO.\r\n\r\nIf you're using white as the color
    of your photo captions, you might want to reconsider it if you have a lot of high-key
    B/W photos. Check the photo caption in your about page. :D"

  body: "I find it interesting that you chose to use letterspacing:-.1em on the headers.
    I can see how it is interesting to merge characters, but not all the characters
    merge and, given the differences in font rendering between browsers, more or less
    of them are actually touching. \r\n\r\nAs mk2 says, having a clickable header
    is extremely common, so requiring users to click the \"back\" button is a little
    counter intuitive. It should also have a rollover, similar to the nav system to
    indicate that it is clickable. Ahh, I see. You've set it up so that the back button
    goes back to the previous page rather than to the home page. A persistent navigation
    might help resolve this.\r\n\r\nI really like the way you've overlaid your images
    with the text and underline. It feels rather nice, though I worry if you don't
    have the text shadow (like on the about page).\r\n\r\nAlso, on the \"Software\"
    page, the \"ft\" is begging for a \"ft\" ligature (I think it is &#64261;), though
    that might break your letter spacing intent.\r\n\r\nIn any case, that's the main
    stuff I saw. Overall I like the feel of the site & especially the hit of color
    in the navigation area, though I wish you'd use those colors more throughout the
    site. \r\n\r\nNice stuff so far!"

  body: "Thanks for responses, I really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nAbout Logo and \"Back\"
    link on inner pages, to be hones I know that clicking on Logo/Caption is most
    \"intuitive\" way getting on front page, but in this case I love the way Back
    button works. This site has such a little quantity of navigation items that getting
    used to only(!) one must be like 123. But, on the other case I'm really thinking
    to make caption link to home page and add \"Home\" (or even Back) suffix on hover.\r\n\r\nI
    really love they way text overlays are displayed over images now, but only in
    Safari. I admit, those texts are sometimes un-readable on B/W photos when viewed
    from Firefox because FF can not display \"1px blurred\" shadows properly, they
    simply are not crisp enough. I'll try to remove shadow and replace it with semi-transparent
    gray (or black) background.\r\n\r\nThanks for comments again.\r\n\r\nOh yeah,
    I've got to learn how to draw icons, and \"favicon\" is prove for that. :D"
