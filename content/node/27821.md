body: "I observed this usage of angle brackets in some stonecarved lettering at MIT.
  Apparently a bunch of angle brackets are used to punctuate a paragraph of text.
  It seems quite strange to me, but I'm sure there's a reason behind it.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a photo:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/duststorm/221555882/\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  offer any explanation for the purpose of those angle brackets?\r\n\r\n-Jonathan-"

  body: It looks like stylistic conceit to me. If you look at when it was done & graphic
    design of that era there may be a clue there. It looks like the sort of thing
    that early simple minds & ultravox album covers were channeling to me. I don't
    think there is a 'type reason' for it.
