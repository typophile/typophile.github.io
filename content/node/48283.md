  body: "1. \"Rihanna,\" looks like some sort of Baskerville, and \"INK.\" would be
    its italic, but I can't find one with an 'R' that has a bracket in the top left
    of the counter.\r\n\r\n2. and 3. look like different weights of the same typeface,
    and I bet the '?' is key to identifying this one.\r\n\r\n4. Is Georgia Italic.\r\n\r\n
