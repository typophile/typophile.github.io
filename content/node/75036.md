  to be more specifically related to the Typophile site.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to install
  Optimo Hermes, however currently it only shows up with one weight at a time. The
  file names in Finder appear as they should, however when installed shows up in FontExplorer
  as a family with all weights called Regular.\r\nAs a result, when you go to use
  the typeface only bold will show up, then if I turn it off Bold Italic will show
  up and so on.\r\n\r\nSee attached for better idea.\r\n\r\nIs there any way of re-naming
  font files or solving this issue? It's killing me!\r\n\r\n"

    and ask for support and/or have them fix the problems with the fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.optimo.ch/pages/compagny/index.php"
