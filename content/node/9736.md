body: As heralded by Hrant, <a href="http://www.magtypo.cz/">TYPO</a> 13 is now available
  for download or purchase &#40;does anyone know if it&#39;s on a newsstand anywhere
  in San Francisco? Right now I only have the PDF&#41;, and the subject of this issue
  is Hrant&#39;s beloved subject of legibility, readability, and the bouma. <BR> <BR>The
  issue leads off with Kevin Larson&#39;s epochal paper, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx">The
  Science of Word Recognition</a>, which the TYPO crewe might have mentioned was taken
  straight from Microsoft&#39;s typography site. This paper was extremely important
  to me in my initial efforts to decipher what the hell Hrant was going on about with
  all of his mentions of the fovea and the parafovea, and as such it&#39;s a near-essential
  primer for people who are striving to think logically about legibility. I myself
  was just a little bummed that so much of the magazine was devoted to something I&#39;d
  already read. <BR> <BR>The next article comes from a charming fellow by the name
  of Hrant Papazian, and reads like one of those early-19th century arguments for
  the existence of God. &#34;Well, I can&#39;t show you any empirical evidence for
  or against the existence of God, but all right-thinking people already know God
  exists, and anyway, empirical evidence is reductive and unimaginative! This is GOD
  we&#39;re talking about here!&#34; I don&#39;t mean to be dismissive, because Hrant&#39;s
  central argument

  body: The brightness contrast of some of the text on color backgrounds surprises
    me for an issue on readability. The first page of Hrant&#39;s article&#39;s black
    on dark ochre is tough enough but the green-on-green of Enneson&#39;s article
    was really disruptive even for such a well written piece.  The Dyson article used
    a raster pattern about half way down the page making that portion of text all
    but unreadable to me. <BR>All-in-all it is a great issue for content and I commend
    TYPO for such a wonderful editorial interplay of ideas. <BR>It makes me wonder
    if they were pushing the boundaries of readability with color and pattern on purpose
    just to see how far they could go before someone said &#34;ouch.&#34; <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    when the letterforms are legible. I honestly didn&#39;t even notice the color
    contrasts &#40;or lack thereof&#41; when I was reading. It all seemed perfectly
    readable to me! <BR> <BR>And Pavel, no apologies are necessary; Keith&#39;s paper
    deserves wider distribution and it gives Hrant something to work against. The
    only reason I was bummed was because there wasn&#39;t more new TYPO for me to
    read!

    As for color, as long as there is sufficient contrast between the text and the
    background, many color combinations are possible. However, most studies have shown
    that dark characters on a light background are superior to light characters on
    a dark background &#40;when the refresh rate is fairly high&#41;. For example,
    Bauer and Cavonius &#40;1980&#41; found that participants were 26% more accurate
    in reading text when they read it with dark characters on a light background.
    Moreover, a survey by Scharff, et al. &#40;1996&#41; revealed that the color combination
    perceived as being most readable is the traditional black text on white background.
    However, it is common for websites &#40;such as this one&#41; to have an off-white
    background in order to reduce the flicker and glare associated with white backgrounds.

    Yes, it&#39;s difficult, and some of his paragraphs have to be read several times,

  body: 'I&#39;m not quite certain how to &#39;solve&#39; the compact and perhaps
    somewhat distended expository style of my Typo 13 contribution except to say that,
    in the context of Hrant&#39;s somewhat cavalier or opportunistic approach to questions
    of evidence, and Kevin&#39;s failure to address matters of construct validity,
    I thought it necessary to develop the kind of text I did. I&#39;ve asked Pavel
    if it might be possible to provide and English-language translation of the Czech-language
    summary supplied by David Barton. Some of my more arcane usages have to do with
    my sense that the typographical craft-evolved terminological repertoire might
    not be adequate to the task of articulating a typographically relevant evidence-based
    understanding of reading. <BR> <BR>Another solution might be to turn my contribution
    into a much larger text, but at the moment my construction of reading is still
    too exploratory and my command of the relevant literature still too fragmentary
    to make that possible. My text as it stands represents a, for me, foundational
    document on which, I hope, I and others can build. But a larger text might be
    even less approachable for the graphic design student who wants an overview of
    the issues more than a detailed elaboration and justification of points of view.
    <BR> <BR>In terms of substantive issues, let me offer the following: contra Kevin,
    I argue that the parallel letter recognition model of word recognition is neither
    sustainable in broadly cognitive-scientific terms nor convenient for gauging and
    channeling typographic practice; against Hrant I argue that the importance of
    internal features discrimination to the wordform &#40;or in Hrant&#39;s terms:
    bouma&#41; resolution mechanisms underlying immersive reading does not warrant
    a parafoveally skewed understanding of reading of the kind Hrant puts forward,
    and hence motivates a somewhat different understanding than his of what counts
    in typographic practice.  <BR> <BR>I also wanted to convey that the key relevant
    issues for typographic practice are &#39;perceptual processing&#39; issues and
    that the benefit of addressing such issues at a fairly sophisticated level lies
    not in telling us in specifics what to do, but in identifying and orienting us
    toward what&#39;s important in typographic formgiving and typeform construction.
    &#40;For example, one consequence of my outlook is to suggest that when using
    or designing a sans-serif font, inter- and intra-letter spacing--managing the
    white of the word--are more critical than they perhaps might be in old-style seriffed
    fonts.&#41;'

    are writing here as &#39;useless nominalization.&#39; <BR> <BR>Here is a comparative
    example from Williams: <BR> <BR>&#34;1a.  Because we knew nothing about local
    conditions, we could not determine how effectively the committee had allocated
    funds to areas that most needed assistance. <BR> <BR>&#34;1b. Our lack of knowledge
    about local conditions precluded determination of committee action effectiveness
    in fund allocation to those areas in greatest need of assistance.&#34;  <BR> <BR>These
    say exactly the same thing. The first is readable, if a bit complex. The second
    is a puzzle that you have to unscramble. Your essay follows the second style,
    to the extreme.  <BR> <BR>I hope that when you write further on these subjects,
    you follow Williams&#39; good counsel.'

    not entirely convinced that texts like the one I prepared for publication don&#39;t
    have a value and a place. In preparing the text I was well aware of the demands
    it would place upon the reader. Not only the typographically trained reader, but
    also the cognitive-scientifically schooled researcher. I was also well aware that
    not every reader would be willing to expend the amount of effort that might be
    required to make sense of it, and I was thrilled to note several did. I felt that
    what would make the text difficult going had more to do with the fairly large
    amount of unfamiliar expressions, rather than the oddities of construction and
    syntax. I hoped that the unfamiliar expressions might be transparent enough to
    allow a level of understanding and not require too much explanation. At one point
    Pavel and I suggested the possibility of a glossary of terms. So in writing the
    text I was taking a calculated risk and consciously engaging in a kind of experiment.

    Hrant, about the fuzzy stuff. Precision, not heady euphony. <BR> <BR>The type
    of expository prose you argue for, William, has its benefits, and were I or anyone
    else to attempt a full, widely accessible presentation of my understanding of
    perceptual processing in reading, I &#40;or that person&#41; would need to subject
    myself to the disciplines Williams, and others like him, outline. I hope you will
    believe me that I am not unaware of these disciplines. But at the time of their
    preparation, the text in place, and the presentation on which it was based, was
    what I could manage. The kind of writing it embodies had its own demands. <BR>

    <BR>2&#41; As I&#39;ve expressed before &#40;although maybe not in public, at
    least not explicitly&#41; I think your essay is what it needs to be, especially
    in the &#34;tonal spectrum&#34; of the whole of Typo13. A topic like this can
    leverage much spirit from what I&#39;ve been calling this &#34;existential&#34;
    style. My complaint above stemmed from Nick&#39;s apparent preference of style
    over content, the admiration of the waves on the surface of the ocean instead
    of the ecosystem within it. <BR> <BR>&#62; there is much that he and I can agree
    on. <BR> <BR>Sure. But these are things I would most probably agree with as well!
    Things like the limits of familiarity, the importance of empiricism, etc. In the
    triangle formed by our three views, my vertex is quite close to the line between
    you and Kevin, and closer to your vertex than his. Exactly what do you and Kevin
    agree on that I don&#39;t? The only thing I can think of is perhaps a belief that
    we can one day have a total grasp of reading &#40;which I have a philosophical
    problem with&#41; and by extension that it&#39;s possible to design type -optimally
    readable type- in a sound, formal, complete state of mind. This is in fact the
    crux of the monotheistic/Roman/Western belief system that I was complaining about
    above; something I myself used to subscribe to in my teens, but no longer. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, I&#39;m not trying to pit you two against each other; I&#39;m all for
    the covergence -or at least mutual illumination- that you describe; but I can&#39;t
    pretend the triangle is equilateral. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; If you knew and
    understood Williams .... <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a huge difference between understanding

    sometimes there&#39;s a need <BR>for formal, precise writing. When I wrote my

    I think <BR>the technical jargon was a bigger problem than the way I put sentences

  body: I confess, I come from a scientific, empirical background. My mother is a
    research scientist &#40;although before that, she was an artist. I picked up much
    of my early fascination with lettering and ornament from her&#41; and my father
    is a lawyer. One of my best friends is a postgraduate researcher in molecular
    biology, and another is completing a PhD in &#40;wait for it&#41; artificial intelligence
    and visual recognition. I myself studied computer science in school, and have
    spent the last ten years working as a software engineer &#40;which is something
    very different&#41;. It&#39;s possible I have a prejudice towards falsifiability
    and materialistic analysis of data rooted in quantifiable phenomena &#40;although
    I&#39;m not sure where &#34;monotheism&#34; is supposed to enter the picture&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>At the same time, I&#39;m a reader first and foremost. Thanks to an early
    exposure to critical theory, I&#39;m comfortable with &#34;difficult discourse&#34;,
    and I&#39;ve come to see the value of inductive, intuitive reasoning as used by
    postmodern philosophers like Jacques Derrida and Julia Kristeva. Any philosophy
    that restricts itself to the world of empirical data is not going to be a very
    useful philosophy, and there are few experiences more rewarding than the &#34;aha&#34;
    that comes with reasoning my way through a knotty bit of metaphysics and finally
    grasping it for myself. <BR> <BR>Reading is both a physical process and an act
    of cognition. One is the domain of research, and the other of cognitive psychology
    and philosophy. I think that if we&#39;re going to talk about the readability
    of the &#42;form&#42; of a text &#40;that is, its layout, typeface, and other
    formatting choices, independent of the words composing the text itself&#41;, we
    have to unbundle the overloaded word &#34;reading&#34;. There is type, there is
    layout, and there is text. We recognize letter- and / or word-forms, we follow
    their flow across the page, and we process the text itself. These are all independent
    acts, some more mechanical than others. <BR> <BR>Hrant, you clearly imply in your
    article that you value the notion of &#34;readability&#34; over &#34;legibility&#34;.
    You seem to believe that research into legibility that fails to account for readability
    is compromised or even useless, but I&#39;m unable to determine why you believe
    that readability subsumes legibility in such an overwhelming way. It seems to
    me that the research Kevin Larson summarizes &#40;not synthesizes; his paper is
    clearly an effort to help typographers understand the state of play in cognitive
    research, rather than to advance any thesis of his own&#41; is concerned with
    the mechanical aspects of reading and how they relate to legibility, and I don&#39;t
    really see where or how you undercut that research, except to dismiss legibility
    as unimportant next to readability. When you do try to attack things head-on,
    that&#39;s exactly where things start to get woolly. <BR> <BR>For example, you
    say that undergraduate students may have less reading &#34;ability&#34; than post-graduate
    students, but I don&#39;t see this is relevant to the discussion of &#42;how&#42;
    people read. I have no doubt that I have the capacity to read much faster than
    I did ten years ago, but I doubt &#40;although am unsure&#41; that the mechanisms
    I use to pick words off the page have changed. The process by which I analyze
    those words has changed tremendously, but the mechanical act of reading is essentially
    the same for me now as it was 20 years ago, when I was starting high school. <BR>
    <BR>You also claim to demonstrate that the PL model of word recognition is inadequate,
    but only by going far beyond the remit of the studies on which the model is based.
    What this suggests to me is that we need more data, so we can see if your intuitively-devised
    theories and the data we can gather will match. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough
    to say, &#34;I&#39;m sure the way I&#39;m doing things is an improvement, because
    that&#39;s what my theory tells me.&#34; At least, that doesn&#39;t convince me
    that you&#39;re not selling me snake-oil or just plain deluded. <BR> <BR>I keep
    chiming in on this thread because I want to know how type works. It&#39;s easy
    to say, for example, that serifs work by creating rails of horizontal stress in
    a text, but I feel uneasy taking that notion on faith. Typography is one of the
    last great guild professions; there are clearly masters, and yeomen, and apprentices,
    and there&#39;s a huge body of accumulated wisdom secreted away here and there
    in books. At least some of the conventional wisdom in any profession as old as
    typography and bookmaking is guaranteed to be false

    <BR> <BR>Guillaume, my comment was not intolerant, but critical. The tone of it
    is dismissive of Peter&#39;s defense of his writing style. The tone should have
    been more gentle, but the rejection is thoroughly merited.  <BR> <BR>Writers,
    in my view, just as typographers, have a responsibility to their readers. The
    manner in which Peter wrote is just a model of the kind of turgid, prolix writing
    that Williams sets out to correct. Further, I find it ironic that in an essay
    on readibility Peter writes in a manner that needlessly requires the reader to
    re-read sentences many times just to puzzle out their meaning.  <BR> <BR>When
    I write on difficult topics I try to write as clearly as I can. Peter&#39;s defense
    that this style in this essay is more &#34;precise&#34; is unsound. Turgid prose
    is just harder to read, not more precise. <BR> <BR>Where Williams writes of useless
    nominalization, Fowler, in his &#34;Modern English Usage&#34; writes of &#34;abstractitis&#34;
    --which is perhaps the best term for what Peter&#39;s essay has a terminal case
    of. Here is an example from Fowler: &#34;&#39;Participation by the men in the
    control of the industry is non-existent&#39; instead of &#39;The men have no part
    in the control of industry.&#39;&#34; <BR> <BR>The first edition of Fowler was
    in 1926, and Williams continues in this tradition with a deeper analysis of the
    same issues, and more help for those writers who want to correct such errors and
    make their writing more readable. My harsh rejection of Peter&#39;s writing style
    in the essay is not simply &#39;my opinion,&#39; but the reflection of a widespread
    campaign for clear writing that has gone on for over seventy-five years, and has
    involved the life work of numerous researchers, writers and teachers.  <BR> <BR>I
    know very well that some Continental philosophers write with full blown &#39;abstractitis&#39;,
    and  that it impresses many people as deep. Even Nick, a writer of admirably lucid
    prose, was impressed.  <BR> <BR>But in reality &#39;abstractitis&#39; has no defense,
    except that the writer, regretably, had no time to make it better. The defense
    that this style, or should I say blunder, is more precise or deep is unsound,
    and is shown to be unsound in detail and in depth by such people as Fowler and
    Williams.'

    I resorted to continental-philosophy-style rhetorical devices to do this. I don&#39;t
    fault Parmenides, Martin Heidegger and others like them for bending the resources
    of the language to convey what they believed needed to be brought across. They
    did what they thought needed doing. Reading them with the expectation of learning

    the extent that the writer of a text has a responsibility toward the reader, the
    reader, who wishes to make sense of a particular text, has a responsibility toward
    the text. And that responsibility is to take the text on its own terms and become
    equal to the challenges it places before the him or her. Not everyone will want

    excellent in readability, with a few unfortunate detours.'

    <BR>Forrest, I now feel much more comfortable with you - thanks for writing all
    that up. And I for one don&#39;t think  your background is a problem here; I&#39;m
    a CompSci guy too, after all. I think it brings more to the table than takes away.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; we have to unbundle the overloaded word &#34;reading&#34; <BR>
    <BR>Yes, we have to see its dimensions &#40;although I think context still allows
    us to simply use the word &#34;readability&#34; for the different aspects&#41;.
    In this context of Typophile, the word/concept refers to the micro typeface level.
    Sure, not world-altering, and yes, less important than the layout, and certainly
    the language, but that&#39;s what we&#39;ve chosen to be here for &#40;as individuals&#41;,
    so that&#39;s the focus&#42;. This is a healthy sort of separation - which however
    doesn&#39;t mean it should become an end to itself. <BR> <BR>&#42; William, if
    we&#39;re really concerned about people &#40;like those whose houses are bulldozed&#41;,
    we would worry about much bigger things than sentence structure... But these are
    our circumstances, and choices. <BR> <BR>Readability versus legibility: It&#39;s
    not that I think the former is a superset of the latter, or that research effort
    must always address both, it&#39;s that readability is more complex, more misunderstood,
    harder to optimize, and most of all more <i>useful</i> to optimize. Letters have
    to be extremely strange for a person to give up reading a poster, but even a slight
    -consciously undetectable- readability defect in a text font can impede completion
    of a book, or even an article &#40;especially if it&#39;s something you <i>have</i>
    to read, as opposed to enjoy&#41;. That said, and as Peter focuses nicely on,
    the essential decipherment that goes on &#40;at the letter and bouma level&#41;
    is very important to understand, and that applies to both. It&#39;s just that
    I&#39;m personally in the dark on that - as is virtually everybody else though,
    it seems. <BR> <BR>&#62; you say that undergraduate students may have <BR>&#62;
    less reading &#34;ability&#34; than post-graduate <BR>&#62; students, but I don&#39;t
    see this is relevant <BR>&#62; to the discussion of &#42;how&#42; people read.
    <BR> <BR>This refers to a classical issue: the different types and degree of reading
    - which can get quite confusing. The relevance here is this: every [adult] reader
    uses boumas; but the degree to which <i>multi-letter</i> boumas &#40;and the parafovea&#41;
    are relied upon depends on experience &#40;among other things&#41;; and the key
    here is that empiricism has [had] trouble detecting this. This is where the difference
    between what might be -awkwardly- called light versus deep immersion comes in:
    when a test subject relies very lightly on multi-letter&#42; boumas, the people
    analyzing the data will simply not see what&#39;s happening. When they see something
    like that &#34;and&#34; being skipped for example, they sort of improvise a tentative
    explanation, and say more research &#40;ie money :-&#41; is needed; their &#34;scientific
    integrity&#34; &#40;at least the contemporary fashion of such, not the old Greek
    style&#41; prevents them from doing what I&#39;ve done. <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, is
    there a nice tight term for &#34;more than one&#34;? <BR> <BR>&#62; we need more
    data <BR> <BR>Agreed. And we need <i>better</i> data, and better interpretation
    of it all, by relying on &#34;practitioner review&#34; more than peer review,
    by not staying aloof towards anecdotalism. <BR> <BR>&#62; &#34;I&#39;m sure the
    way I&#39;m doing things is an improvement <BR> <BR>I&#39;m never sure. That would
    be too Modernist. :-&#41;  I only <i>think</i>, and try to act on it. I don&#39;t
    believe in the sagacity of the PL model, so I put serifs on my text fonts for
    example. I could be putting serifs because that&#39;s what the status quo wants,
    but we already know what I think of the status quo... I do it because it makes
    [functional] sense. And in your case, if you&#39;re really convinced of the PL
    model &#40;your other choice is to be closer to my view - I can&#39;t think of
    an alternative - although there might be one, or even many&#41; then you should
    only use serifs fonts for aesthetic effect. <BR> <BR>&#62; It&#39;s easy to say,
    for example, that serifs work <BR>&#62; by creating rails of horizontal stress
    in a text <BR> <BR>And if you did you&#39;d be joining in a naive delusion. Leading
    is what keeps lines together &#40;assuming &#34;normal&#34; word and letter spacing&#41;.
    There are no rails. And we don&#39;t need arrowheads on the right sides of serifs
    either. Serifs bind. They reduce letter individuality in favor of bouma integrity.
    This btw is where legibility and readability are <i>opposed</i>, although of course
    not fully opposed. Think of them as two vectors at 90 degrees. <BR> <BR>&#62;

    <BR>My friend who is director of the cognitive science program at Georgia Tech
    tells me that the &#39;storytelling&#39; model of human understanding is now scientifically
    recognized as one of the best.  This confirms Williams&#39; view that when writing
    follows that model, it is most direct and easily understandable. When it departs
    further and further it becomes harder and harder to understand.   <BR> <BR>Williams
    has also drawn upon much research in linguistics, as he acknowledges in his book.
    Of course Williams&#39; book is much better than the summary, but this will give
    you a taste of what I think is an outstanding work.

    As far as I&#39;m concerned, my first responsibility when I write for publication
    is to myself - to write precisely what I mean. If I can then make what I have
    to say accessible to a non-specialist audience, then I will, but its not a big

    a specialist field. This article is only likely to be read by people who want
    to understand technical issues surrounding readability &amp; legibility. If people
    want to understand those issues, then they are going to have to put some effort
    in and concentrate. I realise that you&#39;re saying that clearer writing will
    allow readers to concentrate more on the arguments, but I really think that you&#39;re
    too dogmatic in berating Peter for his writing style. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t read

  body: 'I have not yet read the TYPO 13 articles, so I&#39;m not going pontificate
    as I usually do. But I am intrigued by the possibility that empirical research
    might answer some of the most difficult questions facing typographers, in particular
    how to best space type. I really admire the <a href="http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/index.php">work</a>
    that the Clearview people did in <i>testing</i> different letterspacings to determine
    the optimum legibility. Perhaps analogous research can be done for readability.
    <BR> <BR>The questions I would most like to see answered are: <BR> <BR>1. What
    letterspacing optimizes readability? In Jenson&#39;s 1470 Eusebius, the space
    between nn is almost the same width as the inner space of the n. By the mid-16th
    Century <i>Comensis Episcopi Nucerni</i> &#40;I&#39;m working from a scan from
    Updike&#39;s &#60;i&#62;Printing Types&#60;/i&#62;&#41;, that width had become
    about 3:4. And of course 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s phototype took the trend to an
    extreme. Who&#39;s right? To my eyes, the Comensis is a striking example of beautifully
    spaced old metal type. <BR> <BR>2. Should the goal be a completely even page color,
    where all spaces between letters appear to have exactly the same width, or do
    subtle variations in spacing help with word recognition? <BR> <BR>3. Assuming
    that subtle variations are desirable, should they be based on metal type standards,
    or some other principle? To my eyes, pe and oo are two common round-round pairs
    that usually appear tight, while ob and oy are usually loose. These variations
    arise naturally from metal type technology, and have survived into the digital
    age. <BR> <BR>4. Should letter spaces be absolutely consistent, so that all images
    of the same letter-pair look identical? One thing I see frequently in older printed
    samples but very rarely in modern works is a hairline space slipped into a word.
    I have not discovered the logic behind the placement of such spaces &#40;Burnhill
    touches on this point in his book <i>Type Spaces</i>&#41;, but am very curious
    to find what effect they had on readability. <BR> <BR>5. How does size affect
    optimal letterspacing? It is nearly universal for smaller sizes of metal type
    to be spaced more loosely than larger sizes, but this component of optical scaling
    is usually missing from digital typography. <BR> <BR>Of course, the interaction
    between letter shapes and spacing opens many cans of worms, because of the huge
    diversity of letter shapes. I&#39;d be interested in answers to the above questions
    even assuming the letter shapes are from a traditional roman text font.'

    - and I have no idea - Fowler did have a great eye for some things - like &#39;abstractitis&#39;
    - that make writing worse and better. The fact that it is still in print 75 years
    later is a tribute to the fact that it was a breakthrough book in its field. <BR>
    <BR>Williams is better as his advice is more flexible and nuanced. For example,
    he is not simply for or against nominalization, for or against passive voice.
    He tells you when each helps and hurts. I suspect that his advantage is that he
    applies linguistic insights developed since Fowler&#39;s day. He also thinks issues
    of correct word usage - the usual obsession, including Fowler - are of secondary
    importance.

    <BR>&#62; I find his ideas about creating harmony between the black and white
    of text compelling. <BR> <BR>But you do realize of course that he&#39;s talking
    about a harmony among the black and white of a bouma, not [just] letters. Most
    significantly, he applies this to foveal processing too; he places even less faith
    in the PL model than I do. As we say in Armenian, let&#39;s sit crooked but talk
    straight. And I&#39;m not trying to start a fight between you two, so please don&#39;t
    accentuate your agreements as a way to build fortifications against me - work
    with me here, let&#39;s spill all the beans. <BR> <BR>BTW, I agree with the centrality
    of this harmony too, of course; notan is what we read - this is not news. One
    difference though between Peter and me is that he wants to see the insides and
    outsides of boumas weighted equally no matter where they&#39;re seen &#40;fovea
    or parafovea&#41;; this is one big place I think he&#39;s being too Modernist.
    To me, the weighting depends on the distance from fixation &#40;for obvious reasons
    of blur&#41;. I think this appeals to me and not him because it&#39;s a messy
    ideological wrench-in-the-machine. It&#39;s filthy human effluvium. <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>The mechanics of bouma decipherment is one thing, the belief that boumas
    exist is another. The former is where notan is the issue &#40;and it&#39;s no
    small matter for sure&#41;, the latter is where cohesion &#40;think serifs&#41;
    are the issue. To me we&#39;re discussing the latter - not least because I think
    serifs, tight letterspacing, etc. do more to bind than bad notan does to hinder
    reading; we can get used to new shapes, but we can&#39;t learn to bind with no
    glue. Slap serifs on a &#34;funky&#34; skeleton &#40;as long as the degree of
    divergence is correct&#41;, and space it well, and you&#39;ll outperform the most
    notanically-optimal sans in the world &#40;Legato&#41;. Well, I think so at least.
    <BR> <BR>Reeling in a bit: <BR>The PL model says you can set a long book in sans
    and not affect reading fatigue. There is no empirical evidence to counter this
    view, so the empiricists are happy. There is however the little matter of five
    centuries of vehement anecdotal opposition to this idea. How do we explain this
    disparity? But throwing the entire corpus of anecdotal evidence out the window,
    or by accepting the limits of the PL model? &#60;woolly&#62;Come on.&#60;/woolly&#62;
    <BR> <BR>&#62; I will of course share my findings. <BR> <BR>Which is very generous.
    I&#39;ve said this before, and I&#39;ll say it again: we&#39;re very lucky to
    have you, and I think and hope that your role will be pivotal in the evolution
    of the understanding of readability among practitioners. But you will have to

    or not read were based on style. I stopped reading Kevin&#39;s when he gayly dismissed
    the dominance of upper and lower case over all-caps as an accident. That&#39;s
    like telling a chef that tasty meals have nothing to do with nutrition. If I were
    a scientist, I would be inclined to create tests that explain the prevalence of
    U&amp;lc, rather than gloss over it. <BR> <BR>&#62; What letter-spacing optimizes
    readability? <BR> <BR>Ralph, your question hits to the core of the issue. Quite
    plainly, there can be no scientific answer to this, because it is a design problem.
    Let me explain. <BR> <BR>However reading is conceptualized and measured, whether
    by words, letters, strokes, or other more abstract, less representational visible
    features such as those mentioned by Peter, the job of the type designer &#40;and
    typographer&#41; is to create typesetting which is a harmonious image field against
    which the individual components may be optimally differentiated. <BR> <BR>The
    reason for the harmony is two-fold. Firstly, harmony provides a consistency of
    &#34;colour&#34; against which meaningful forms stand out clearly; uneven colour
    creates artefacts which may be misinterpreted as significant. Secondly, when the
    discrete nature of letters is compromised, the harmony of &#34;all separate letters&#34;
    is broken: this disharmony occurs when, through type design flaws, accidental
    ligatures occur, such as &#34;r_n&#34; confusing modern with modem. Similarly,
    the letter-components of words may configure themselves ambiguously, for instance
    &#34;seklan&#34; might be read as &#34;seldan&#34;. <BR> <BR>No amount of theoretical
    knowledge will help designers solve the problem of &#34;even colour&#34;, because
    the design parameters are too multi-dimensional. Let&#39;s face it, even two parameters
    require a human value-judgement, as in &#34;do you want that &#40;design product&#41;
    lighter or stronger?&#34; <BR> <BR>Here is a demonstration of the value-judgements
    that have to be applied to spacing. The test-case is the spacing &#40;and possible
    kerning&#41; of the sequence &#34;OTC&#34; in a sans serif italic. I have chosen
    Italic, because it&#39;s trickier, and highlights the difficulties. <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/67897.jpg" alt="OTC"> <BR> <BR>1.
    Roman. <BR> <BR>2. The problem arises because the O and C should not be straightforward
    skews. That doesn&#39;t look right -- among other things it distorts the thickness
    of the supposedly monoline stroke, and such inconsistencies &#40;including optical
    illusions&#41; are compensated for in glyph construction. For the same reason,
    vertical strokes are thicker than horizontal ones; why? well, that&#39;s a whole
    nother ball of wax, as Peter might say. <BR> <BR>3. Because of the compensation,
    the distance between the glyph near points becomes uneven. But everything must
    be evenly spaced for optimum differentiation. So how does the type designer resolve
    the problem? It&#39;s a subjective value judgement as to what is most important,
    which is, in effect, a decision as to what relative priority the reader will attach,
    in his/her &#34;sense&#34; of even colour, to the different formal relationships
    involved in this glyph sequence. <BR> <BR>Here, in 3, Neue Helvetica 46 ships
    with no compensation, the presumption being that the distance between the major
    vertical strokes should be consistent. <BR> <BR>In 4, optical kerning &#40;InDesign&#41;
    attaches more importance to near-point distance, with the result that the larger-scale
    value of white-spacing becomes uneven. <BR> <BR>5. Here, in a spacing strategy
    more often seen in display setting, the near-point values are equalized, with
    larger scale gross unevenness; but who is to say that this is not more legible
    in immersive reading, until it is tested empirically? <BR> <BR>So, there are different
    spacing strategies available, the relative import of which may vary with the size,
    tracking, weight, and style &#40;eg degree of slant&#41; of the typeface. These
    strategies have a bearing on glyph design: for instance, the top and bottom extrema
    points of the O in Helvetica 46 are &#34;skewed&#34; less than the straight &#34;vertical&#34;
    strokes. By how much may be decided by issues such as this spacing problem. <BR>
    <BR>Furthermore, resolving this spacing problem may upset spacing relationships
    in other character combinations. <BR> <BR>This particular example, concerning
    a difficulty of print typography, may not seem significant to the matter of letter-recognition,
    but remember, even colour optimizes readability, and glyph design is predicated
    on even colour. This example may not seem significant for reading roman text on
    screen, but it is typical of the complex design considerations involved in type,
    and not something that can be reduced to simple science.  <BR> <BR>As Peter says,
    in boldface, the &#34;micro-aesthetics&#34; of typography are actually functional.
    <BR> <BR>Now, on to the biology. It is my understanding that there are different
    receptors, or processors, in different areas of the visual cortex, for things
    such as &#34;closeness&#34;, &#34;verticality&#34;, &#34;evenness&#34;, etc. These
    are used in parallel.  <BR> <BR>Prompted by an initial stimulus, the viewer creates
    a &#34;bouma&#34; which he/she throws into the rapidly cycling feedback loop of
    reading. This bouma is a flexible, predictive model of what forms the reader expects
    to see on further inspection of the text. The reader is searching for a match
    between linguistic meaning and textual form, both of which resolve in unison.
    As John Hudson has mentioned in a previous thread, the reader uses whatever is
    necessary to decode the text. So, at one level, massive tracts can be &#34;quantum
    read&#34; at speed with paragrpah-size boumas, and at the other end of the scale,
    the bouma may shrink to sub-glyph size to resolve an ambiguity.  <BR> <BR>The
    same text may be re-read: different, additional boumas, deeper meanings. <BR>
    <BR>Boumas of all sizes can be processed by the neural equipment, because it is
    a bag of instruments not limited by simple representational forms such as letters.
    <BR> <BR>Personal and cultural differences come into play, based on which combination
    of the visual processors are used to read the text. For instance, one person may
    read &#34;o&#34; as a line which connects upon itself &#40;ouroboros&#41;, while
    another reads it as a shape symmetrical about two axes.  <BR> <BR>In conclusion,
    that&#39;s it for now.'

  body: I&#39;d like to see a moratorium on the use of the word &#34;bouma&#34; as
    a term of art until we have some kind of consensus on what it actually means.
    It feels like a neologism that hides more than it shows right now. Is it the boundaries
    of the chunk of text we&#39;re perceiving right now? &#40;This is what I think
    Nick is describing it as.&#41; Is it the shape of the word currently under your
    eye? &#40;This is what I&#39;ve understood Hrant to construe it as.&#41; I don&#39;t
    think our understanding of word shape and textual recognition is far enough along
    for us to subsume such a tricky and contentious bundle of concepts beneath jargon.

  body: 'Peter, when Williams says he rejects &#39;Draconian&#39; rules, it is because
    he recognizes that different situations call for different approaches. But he
    is quite definite, as Mahrer immediately explains, that the story telling model
    is the clearest way to write. The point is that in different situations this goal
    is accomplished by different means. Also clarity is not the only goal; coherence,
    for example, is also very important for the reader to follow the writer&#39;s
    train of thought. Hence different situations call for different solutions and
    compromises, as he explains at length.  <BR> <BR>He does, however clearly identify
    what he regards as turgid or prolix prose that he proposes to remedy. If you compare
    the &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; examples that Mahrer quotes from Williams,
    I&#39;m afraid that many of your sentences in your essay follow the &#39;bad&#39;
    example for precisely the reasons he explains. And these sentences can be made
    much clearer, in exactly the manner explained, without any loss of meaning. In
    fact, you yourself did this above, in rewriting the sentence I pointed out as
    turgid and correctable.  <BR> <BR>&#62;Does it mean thetic-critical discourse
    must be avoided or recast according to a storytelling &#40;character&#43;actions&#41;
    model?  <BR> <BR>Please define &#39;thetic-critical discourse&#39; for me and
    I can address your question. I do not know what you mean by this phrase.  <BR>
    <BR>Williams does not say that all writing must follow the story model, but only
    that when we depart from it we will be less clear and immediately understood.
    We may gain something by departing from it, but we will lose clarity.   <BR>   <BR>My
    friend mentioned the &#39;story&#39; model in the context of creating and learning
    concepts in science. If I understood her correctly, the most basic way memories
    are stored is as scenarios: I open the door door to my house see the stairs on
    the left, etc. So in understanding the creative process of building new concepts
    or in explaining a concept to someone who doesn&#39;t know it, it is helpful to
    identify and use such scenarios. If indeed scenarios are fundamental in human
    thinking--as my friend reports current research seems to support--it does give
    further credence to Williams&#39; approach to writing.   <BR> <BR>I do feel awkward
    using so many words in this thread on the subject of readable composition, when
    it is about readable typography. However, I will be happy to follow up on your
    &#39;thetic-critical&#39; question, as soon as I understand it.'

  body: 'I&#39;ve been pondering whether to make any contribution to the discussion
    of the style of Peter&#39;s essay. On the one hand, I consider this discussion
    a distraction, and wonder if Peter, Kevin and Hrant&#39;s initial notion to begin
    a separate Typophile discussion on reading might have been a better idea than
    beginning it within the context of this thread about Typo 13. On the other hand,
    it is something that I have thought about from time to time since I first read
    Peter&#39;s essay in Thessaloniki last summer, and it touches on my response to
    philosophical texts I have read in recent years. So please consider this message
    an aside from what I consider the main discussion, and I&#39;m only sending it
    because I think some of the exchange between William and others has become unnecessarily
    hostile. I think there are ways of thinking about Peter&#39;s rhetorical techniques
    that may encourage charity. <BR> <BR>Generally, I agree with William that writing
    should seek to be lucid, and to convey the writer&#39;s ideas as clearly as possible.
    I don&#39;t think this always means that the writing must seek to be &#39;as simple
    as possible but no simpler&#39;: not all discourse is analogous to a scientific
    theory or, in philosophic terms, a formal proposition. One can, of course, meditate
    on any text, but some texts are what I would class as deliberately meditative,
    i.e. intended to oblige or force the reader to approach the meaning through a
    process of active engagement with the &#40;often dense&#41; verbal structures
    of the text. I consider Peter&#39;s essay to be in this class of texts that invite
    or demand meditative reading. William criticises Peter&#39;s text as requiring
    the reader to re-read sentences several times to get at their meaning, but this
    seems to me to be exactly Peter&#39;s aim: he wants the reader to wrestle with
    the text. To read such a text is not simply to take in its information as expressed,
    but to work at &#39;translating&#39; it to arrive at a &#39;version&#39; of the
    text that is clear to the individual reader. There are few exercises that demand
    closer engagement with a text than translation, and it seems to me that Peter
    wants to force something akin to such engagement. Whether we are willing to play
    along, is a question for each reader. <BR> <BR>Where I agree with William is that
    I don&#39;t think Peter&#39;s text <i>needs</i> to be written the way it is written,
    that the ideas in the essay could have been expressed in a more direct and lucid
    language. But Peter made a decision and employed a deliberate &#39;rhetorical
    strategy&#39; to create a text that demands a particular kind of reading, and
    I&#39;m willing to enage with his ideas on those terms &#40;and it is a strategic
    decision, which is why I disagree with Raph&#39;s translation &#39;writing style&#39;,
    which seems to miss something of the intent&#41;. <BR> <BR>At their best, meditative
    -- or consciously &#39;difficult&#39; -- texts can be Sokratic in effect. That
    is, they force the reader to consider assumptions, to return to the ideas discussed
    again and again looking for a more precise understanding, and they can inspire
    unexpected ideas in the reader&#39;s own thinking on the subject as a product
    of a meditative process that differs greatly from the kind of immediate response
    we typically make to what might be broadly called &#39;information&#39;. <BR>
    <BR>At their &#40;frequent&#41; worst, such texts are simply unnecessarily complex
    and deliberately obscurantist: they require a meditative reading, but do not reward
    meditation. In this respect, they are the antithesis of Sokratic: they are sophist,
    employing rhetoric to mask falsehood, ignorance or philosophical bankruptcy. <BR>
    <BR>The meta-problem of all such texts is that one needs to engage with them quite
    deeply, and with a degree of philosophical charity -- there might be something
    of value in them --, in order to determine whether one is dealing with a thoughtful
    meditative text or with a piece of sophistic showmanship. I suspect that William
    would ask &#39;Why should I bother to go to such trouble? By what right does this
    author make this demand of me? What good will has he shown to the reader?&#39;,
    and I&#39;m often inclined to ask this question myself when faced with such texts.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that one&#39;s willingness to deal with
    such texts is greatly dependent on one&#39;s sympathy for the ideas behind them,
    and that general interest in the presumed subject matter is not always sufficient
    &#40;although, clearly, negative reaction to the rhetorical techniques employed
    may overcome such sympathy, as it seems to do for William&#41;. I have very little
    sympathy, for instance, with the ideas of Jacques Derrida, so have only occasionally
    bothered to think my way through one of his texts &#40;and have generally emerged
    less sympathetic than when I started&#41;. On the other hand, I have much more
    willingness to engage with a very similar set of rhetorical techniques, even use
    of Derridean jargon, in Catherine Pickstock&#39;s deconstruction of Derrida&#39;s
    ideas on language and writing, because I&#39;m much more sympathetic to her underlying
    ideas. [That said, the most striking parts of Pickstock&#39;s <i>Beyond Writing</i>
    are those in which she is most lucid, drops the jargon and writes in plain English.
    But perhaps that too is a rhetorical strategy.] I&#39;m willing to engage with
    Peter&#39;s ideas in the way in which he has chosen to express them, precisely
    because I have some sympathy for his critique of both Kevin and Hrant, and I appreciate
    the subversive nature of his questioning of them. <BR> <BR>Like William, when
    I see a text full of unclear nominalisation, I am usually suspicious of the intent
    of the author. Often, such rhetorical techniques do seem to signal problems in
    the underlying ideas, which the writer has attempted to disguise through dense
    and obscure verbal trickery. I share William&#39;s skepticism when it comes to
    Heidegger, and have never found much of value behind Derrida&#39;s verbal cleverness.
    And I should add that I think the frequent &#40;mis&#41;characterisation of such
    reactions in terms of an Anglo-American analytical tradition vs. a Continental
    tradition of philosophy is inadequate, as the oft-remarked-on lucidity of Hans
    Georg Gadamer&#39;s <i>Truth and Method</i> demonstrates. [Derrida&#39;s refusal
    to engage in debate with Gadamer still seems to me a signal admission of philosophical
    cowardice.] <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ve learned to be charitable, having recognised
    what I consider an authentic or at least honest strand of such writing, which
    is subversive of its own technique. Peter&#39;s essay, and his comments here,
    make it clear that the is seeking something through his ideas, and through his
    approach to &#39;precision&#39; in their discussion. I&#39;m not suspicious of
    his motives. I don&#39;t think he is trying to sell me philosophical snake oil.
    I don&#39;t think his ideas need to be expressed in the way they are in the essay,
    but perhaps in the discussion here we can, together, refine and re-express them
    while maintaining his salutory insistence on precision. As I wrote in the apparently
    notorious &#39;graphic communication&#39; thread, I consider conversation to be
    the very best method for the development of ideas and their understanding. <BR>
    <BR>I also think that there is a delightful irony that an essay that considers
    &#39;immersive reading&#39; should be anything but immersive. Knowing Peter, this
    irony may well be intentional.'

    immersed in the rigours of writing.&#41;  <BR>Perhaps most of the things that
    needed saying, pro and con about rhetorical strategy choices have now been said
    and we can move on. <BR> <BR>Forrest, I think a moratorium on &#39;bouma&#39;
    might be a good thing. The term is at best a slippery fish. A moratorium might
    force Hrant to say what he means in other ways. <BR>The use of a technical term
    in a discussion is a social contract. In the case of &#39;bouma&#39; I&#39;m not
    sure every participant in this discussion has agreed to it. Certainly the content
    Kevin specifies for it in his essay &#40;word shape in the sense of outline or
    raw pattern of neutral, ascending and descending characters&#41; differs from
    Hrant&#39;s sense of what it involves, or so it seems to me. <BR>In addition,
    Hrant, the issue as I see it is not &#39;the belief that boumas exist&#39;, but
    whether the term can be made to embody a construct that is useful for clarifying
    or elaborating how perceptual processing in reading works. I still believe that
    might be possible. <BR>Hrant, you say: &#34;...a bouma is &#40;virtually always&#41;
    a single letter in the fovea...&#34; I think you are wrong about the &#39;virtually
    always,&#39; but aside from that, when you say it is a single letter in the fovea
    I begin to wonder if you aren&#39;t playing too fast and loose with the term.
    Here I begin to think you might be using &#39;bouma&#39; as a synonym for &#39;perceptual
    processing primitive&#39;, or &#39;unit of perceptual processing&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Hrant&#39;s
    &#39;bouma&#39; comes from &#39;Bouma shape&#39; and in that form is first used
    by Taylor and Taylor in their &#34;The Psychology of Reading.&#34; In T&amp;T&#39;s
    text the authors&#39; intent is to factor into a notion of word shape more than
    &#39;outline&#39; or &#39;raw pattern of neutral, ascending and descending characters&#39;.
    However, in their use of it, a word&#39;s &#39;bouma shape&#39; refers to a coefficient--a
    string of numbers coding &#40;essentially&#41; perceptual distances between component
    letter forms. Not &#39;shape&#39; in the conventional sense. And the point they
    want to make comes down to this: when this new level of information is added to
    the notion of word shape, the word shapes of &#40;I think it was&#41; 97 percent
    of words in a typical text are seen to be unique. So bouma ambiguity in a typical
    expository text accounts for a relatively small part of the retrograde saccade
    rate encountered in a competent reader&#39;s reading of a typical &#40;Williams
    approved?&#41; expository text. <BR>\tHrant picked the term up from his reading
    of Paul Saegner&#39;s &#34;Space between Words&#34;, who adapt it from Taylor
    and Taylor. In Saegner&#39;s glossary its meaning is specified as &#34;the shape
    of the word when written in upper- or lower-case letters and delimited by space.&#34;
    \ <BR>\tIn the first Hrant use of it that I encountered there were references
    to the internal and external outlines in a word. At the time I was reading Gerrit
    Noordzij&#39;s &#40;soon to appear in English&#41; &#34;The stroke,&#34; and the
    reference to the inner and outer form of the word resonated with me. Later Hrant&#39;s
    &#39;bouma&#39; became the word as seen in blurry parafoveal vision. Bringing
    boumas into the fovea means that it has to mean something different again than
    the &#39;blurry paravoveal vision&#39; iteration. <BR>\tMy own &#40;playful&#41;
    derivation almost half-a-dozen years ago looked like this: We see a bounded, separated
    and rhythmically cohering configuration of grouped alphabetic or numerical forms.
    We see a bounded map = boundedmap = bou[nded]ma[p] = bouma. I might state the
    first sentence differently now. But the second might still be a place to start.
    It would allow us to say: the perceptual processing primitive for vision in normal
    immersive reading of familiar words &#40;where legibility is not an issue&#41;
    is a bounded map of role-architectural and role-architecturally evoked particulars.
    \ <BR>\tWhat might be the use to type-involved individuals of saying this, or
    something like it? Perhaps the following: anything that might hinder the optical
    integrity of the bounded map should be attended to, whether its source be problems
    of spacing, glyph shape or stroke conformity. This is why good typographers are
    fanatical about kerning, ligatures, etc. To my mind we need not think of concerns
    with spacing etc, first and foremost, as aesthetic concerns, though they can and
    should be that too. First and foremost such concerns must be concerns to meet
    an &#39;ease of perceptual processing&#39; requirement. <BR>\t <BR>This gets us
    into the &#39;space craft&#39; thread in this forum. And I will have more to say
    about that in time. &#40;The Bigelow / spatial frequency grating contribution
    in the comp.fonts discussion will help!&#41; But also in the picture is the matter
    of lateral interference. <BR> <BR>By the way: how do I get back for reference
    the top messages on the forum? They have disappeared &#40;because of the 7-day
    setting&#41;."

  body: 'I&#39;ve now done a first reading of all three papers, and some more digging
    in the literature. For more on the physiology of vision, I recommend the paper
    <a href="http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/lifesci/optometry/research/projects/PeriVis.htm">Compound
    grating discrimination in extrafoveal and amblyopic vision</a>. Also, it&#39;s
    too bad Hrant&#39;s <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html">blurred
    fixation images</a> weren&#39;t used; they were very helpful for my understanding.
    I&#39;d really love to see carefully prepared versions of these images based on
    an accurate model of grating sensitivity and real saccade data. <BR> <BR>I can
    see why people would be turned off by the hranting and hraving in Hrant&#39;s
    article, but I am very sympathetic to his central point, which I will now distort
    hopelessly by saying in my own words. We can take almost as an article of faith
    the principle that the visual system integrates <i>all</i> useful information
    presented to it. Both the word shape and parallel letter recognition models are
    deeply flawed because they both call for useful information to be discarded. <BR>
    <BR>In particular, I&#39;m talking about the blurred image in the parafovea, and
    most especially cases where the fixation points of the saccade sequence skip over
    words &#40;this would correspond to the third of the three zones in Kevin&#39;s
    description, comprising about 8 to 15 letters out from the fixation point&#41;.
    The resolved retinal image does not have enough detail to reliably resolve the
    letters in these areas, but at the same time it is clear that readers use the
    image for <i>something</i>. The word shape model would discard all information
    other than the outline of the word shape, while the parallel letter recognition
    model would discard almost all information other than the &#34;length of upcoming
    words and [...] best location for the next fixation point.&#34; <BR> <BR>I also
    think Hrant is on to something with his insistence that the reading process is
    based on heuristics. To continue the &#34;Roadside joggers&#34; example, in the
    blurred retinal image there is not enough information to reliably distinguish
    the word &#34;and&#34; from, say, &#34;aml&#34; or &#34;srd&#34;. There is, of
    course, plenty enough information to distinguish it from &#34;from&#34;. I&#39;m
    sure that somewhere inside the visual system there&#39;s a representation that
    looks like &#34;sweat, pain ### angry drivers&#34;, where ### represents a fuzzy
    equivalence class admitting &#34;and&#34; with very high fitness, &#34;aml&#34;
    and &#34;srd&#34; with high fitness, and &#34;from with very low fitness. The
    higher linguistic levels no doubt look at this representation and are happy with
    the fuzzy equivalence class. If they weren&#39;t, they&#39;d send word down and
    there would be a regressive saccade to see what the word <i>really</i> says. I
    would guess that another function of the regressive saccades is to provide higher-quality
    training data for the &#40;fuzzy&#41; letter and multiletter recognition discriminators
    that see only blurry input. <BR> <BR>These fuzzy equivalence classes should be
    familiar to anyone who&#39;s tried to do speech recognition. Getting a computer
    to reliably distinguish spoken &#34;how to recognize speech&#34; from &#34;how
    to wreck a nice beach&#34; is notoriously difficult. In this example, though,
    the primary difficulty is distinguishing word boundaries, which is thankfully
    much easier for printed text thanks to adequate wordspacing. <BR> <BR>If my understanding
    is correct, then the job for typographers is to make images that resolve to as
    narrow an equivalence class as possible when blurred, so that the linguistic levels
    can get the same confidence in words with longer saccade jumps. Oddly enough,
    it would seem that this job is quite similar to that of the Clearview designers,
    except that in their case the image degredation is caused by fog and night driving
    conditions rather than the reading process pushing the lower-level visual process
    to the edge of its envelope to optimize reading speed. So maybe there isn&#39;t
    as much of a rift between legibility and readability as commonly thought.'

    <BR> <BR>Kevin, you say: &#34;[t]he boundary study described in the paper demonstrates
    that during normal reading we combine the incomplete parafoveal letter recognition
    with additional time completing letter recognition in the foveal region.  <BR>
    <BR>I think &#39;demonstrates&#39; is too strong a word here.  <BR>Maybe you will
    grant this readily. <BR>But let me state my reasons for saying it. <BR>Your view
    of what the boundry study allows you to take as fact might be the most ready-to-hand
    for you, given 1&#41; the fact that the distal stimulus material is made of letters,
    2&#41; your &#39;parallel letter recognition&#39; bias and 3&#41; your assumptions
    about mental processes. But it might not be the most probable, elegant, compelling,
    or fertile, when a wider range of factors and assumptions, or a different bias,
    or a &#39;deconstruction&#39; of your terms of reference &#40;sorry about the
    Derridaian slip John&#41; are taken into account.  <BR>Perhaps I need to demonstrate
    the above, but the most you can say, I think, is: &#34;[t]he boundary study described
    in the paper is consistent with the view that during normal reading we combine
    the incomplete parafoveal letter recognition with additional time completing letter
    recognition in the foveal region.&#34; Meanwhile, the most I would grant is: &#34;[t]he
    boundary study described in the paper is not, on the face of it, inconsistent
    with the view that during normal reading we combine the incomplete parafoveal
    letter recognition with additional time completing letter recognition in the foveal
    region.&#34; That is, the boundry study doesn&#39;t falsify your view. <BR> <BR>The
    big unknown here is precisely how the parafoveal preview benefit works. Beyond
    providing length and word-boundary cues, how it works is a dark area. We can be
    confident of the following: misleading visual cues 1&#41; up into the role-architectural
    and role architecturally evoked level &#40;bowls / stems / counters and their
    positional relations&#41;, and 2&#41; to a distance of minimally 15 characters
    from the point of fixation, detrimentally affect the operative neuronal representation
    of parafoveally previewable material. <BR>I think the effect of lateral interference
    in a parafoveal presentation of a word is such that Kevin&#39;s partial letter
    information can&#39;t be meaningfully resolved and fed forward. Some studies try
    to work with the notion that a crude but useful neuronally compiled textural map
    accounts for the parafoveal preview benefit."

    Probably a more precise statement is that sharp and blurred images on the parafovea
    are perceived more or less the same. This <a href="http://psy.ucsd.edu/~sanstis/PDFs/Blurry.pdf">paper</a>
    gives a fairly striking demonstration of this effect. <BR> <BR>What <i>really</i>
    happens in the parafovea still seems pretty mysterious to me. The compound grating
    paper I linked above strongly suggests that you lose the ability to perceive phase
    information more quickly than you lose the ability to perceive contrast information
    as you go from the center of the fovea. That&#39;s a fascinating nugget of information,
    and one that I&#39;m pretty sure is relevant to typography, but on the other hand,
    it also shows that you can&#39;t just do a Photoshop radial blur and expect it
    to accurately simulate the perception of images in the parafovea.

  body: "I'm not sure if I'm doing right in contributing to this trhead with my post
    but I think that altough I'm no expert on the topic, I can provide a view that
    may help to elucidate the problem. This is the view of Frank Smith's \"A Psycholinguistic
    Analisys of Reading and Learning to Read\" (I acutally read the Spanish translation).\r\n\r\nI
    read the three articles this afternoon as part of the research I'm doing for my
    own thesis and so I decided to jump in.  \r\n\r\nFrank starts stating that the
    reading hability is not different from mundane perceptual activities such as discerning
    tables from chairs and that there is nothing in reading (speaking of language)
    out of the competence of anyone who has the hability to understang spoken language.\r\n\r\nHis
    main statement is that reading is not about deciphering or extracting sounds or
    words out of the text but about giving it a sense (reading is a perceptual activity
    and a function of perception is to give sense to the information our senses report
    to the brain and to guide them in the sake of such).\r\n\r\nHe distinguishes two
    kinds of information used during the reading process: \r\n\r\n* Visual Information,
    which is the images the brain recieves from the printed matter. Visual information
    is indispensable but not enough to read a text.\r\n\r\n* Non Visual Information,
    which is the information the reader already knows. Non visual information can
    be of many kinds but some very important kinds of non visual information for reading
    are the knowledge of the language(ortographic -such as factible letter combinations-,
    syntactic and semantic as well), the knowledge of the topic, the knowledge of
    how to read, the knowledge of the graphic organization of a given kind of text,
    etc. But even the knowledge of a certaing literary style will help.\r\n\r\nHe
    proposes that for reading non visual information is more important than visual
    information and that the more non visual information we have the least visual
    information we need to read a text.\r\n\r\nHe explains that there is a severe
    bottle neck on the amount of visual information that the brain can recieve and
    process so what we really do when reading a text is to discard at least 75% of
    visual information and use our perceptive skills to predict and confirm the meaning
    of the text trough the reduction of uncertainty by the redundancy of the information
    contained in our brains (non visual).\r\n\r\nSo the main hability behind reading
    is to reduce the dependency on visual information by the elimination of choices
    trough redundancy of the non visual information.\r\n\r\nPerception, memory and
    sense are the key concepts in Frank's view of reading because they determine the
    low capacity of the brain to process visual information and the high capacity
    of the brain to deal with meaningful information.\r\n\r\nReading must be oriented
    to the discovery of meaning and not the decyphering of sounds or words because
    only meaningful information stays in memory to feed perception and to relate with
    our cognoscitive structure (already owned knowledge).\r\n\r\nSo this brings us
    to the medular topic of this thread:\r\n\r\n\xBFAre we reading letter by letter,
    word by word or phrase by phrase?\r\n\r\nThe answer would be that we are reading
    the meaning of the text and to achieve so we would read at the nevel we need on
    any given moment to reduce our uncertainty of such meaning: words, letters, phrases,
    punctuation... even a single letter stroke, or a couple of letters, a white space
    between letters or the blurry shape of a word could help us to define our understanding
    of the meaning of a text.\r\n\r\nThe method proposed by Frank Smith to do such
    a thing is \"feature identification\" (hope I translated it right -an\xE1lisis
    de rasgos-) which would only look for a given feature or a set of given features
    on an item to identify it (as a way to reduce the uncertainty along with the non
    visual information and the prediction of what could this item be).\r\n\r\nReading
    in other ways (on a pure letter, word or phonic level) would slow down our reading
    hability by saturating our short term memory with meaningless (unrelated) information.
    This is why meaningless or random text can't be read fast, there is no way to
    predict or understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this is in a gross and unsophisticated
    review of the of Frank Smith's theories on the reading process. I'm willing to
    clarify the topic with details of the author's text and arguments if requested.
    Hope this doesn't come out of place and that can be useful to the discussion."

    for speed and accuracy in reading, against the relatively minor impact of type

    like \"discard at least 75% of visual information\" is exactly the type of thing
    I put forth. That said, it's important to try to separate the issue of readability
    into chunks which are manageable and of course pertinent to the people at hand...
    like type designers. For example, \"non-visual information\" is great, but it's
    peripheral to type design.\r\n\r\nAnd to yet again correct John's stance at the
    beginning of this new year :-) I would remind everybody that no matter how minor
    an improvement is, it can be relevant to some people some of the time. Type design
    as a whole is (almost) never of critical importance anyway, so saying \"it doesn't
    matter\" is self-defeating. The amount of effort that John for example -rightly-

  body: "Where type design matters most, in terms of readability, is almost always
    linked to specific reproduction or rendering conditions, and the better those
    conditions are the less type design matters <em>to readability</em> and, conversely,
    the more it matters in terms of aesthetic, cultural and stylistic concerns, in
    which mere variety is not the least of benefits. We have such a rich typographic
    heritage precisely because over 550 years we have developed methods of reproduction
    that render most distinctions in terms of readability between different text faces
    moot. If something is going to be well printed at typical text sizes, no designer
    wrings his hands and says 'Oh dear, I wonder whether Caslon is more minutely readable
    than Garamond or the other way around'. Typographic design decisions on the plateau
    provided by readerability, non-visual information and good reproduction conditions
    are almost never concerned with readability, and almost entirely concerned with
    aesthetic, stylistic, etc. considerations. It is only as the reproducion conditions
    are reduced in quality -- e.g. sub-normal text sizes, poor paper stock, low resolution,
    \ etc. -- that readability <em>as an aspect of type design</em> increases in importance.
    And in order to design readable text types for such conditions <em>you need to
    know precisely what the conditions are.</em> This is why a typeface that has been
    carefully designed to be readable on screen using a particular rendering system
    is not going to be a model of readability if used to print a telephone directory.
    Readability is totally dependent on output conditions. So where I disagree with
    Hrant is that he seems to want to make readability the primary focus of the type
    designer's general work, whereas I see it as a specialised aspect of that work
    that is of relative importance depending on output conditions.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    the specialisation of type design for reduced reproduction quality can lead to
    some interesting imbalances. Poor conditions tend to get lumped together, e.g.
    telephone books are printed very quickly on poor quality paper <em>and</em> at
    small sizes, so type designers making fonts for use at very small sizes tend to
    assume other conditions will also be sub-optimal. Mark Barratt gave a very interesting
    presentation at ATypI in Helsinki about selecting fonts for use in mass-mailed
    response forms, which are set at very small sizes indeed but incredibly well printed
    on coated stock. He found very few types that were appropriate to this task in
    part, I think, because most types designed for use at very small sizes presume
    poor printing conditions. If the printing is so good that ink traps and other
    readability enhancing features designed for less good reproduction conditions
    are distorting the letterforms even at 5pt, the font is not appropriate. Through
    this project, Mark ended up identifying a poorly supplied niche in the type market."

    gives to the page, even if they can't articulate why and don't know anything about
    the history of the particular type or its place in the typographic scheme of things:
    they respond intuitively and personally to style. And style is exactly what motivates
    the legions of font 'collectors' and 'swappers': if they didn't care about style,
    they wouldn't want all those different fonts. And it is precisely because laymen
    do care about style, however ignorantly, that software companies have realised
    that bundling diverse font collections adds both perceived and effective value

    fonts in their list and try them just to be different than the last thing they
    typed. Some people may just choose a font based on where it is on the menu (proximity
    to default faces for instance). Computer users are used to their menu driven world.
    They make their choices based on what is on the menu, not what \"style\" they
    may truly like best if they shopped around. Readability is adjusted by them in
    the \"Point Size\" menu and their judgment is, more than likely, based on the
    screen image, not the printed page. They never use 10pt in their own word processing
    except maybe for footnotes. If 12pt were not the default size, they probably would
    use something bigger. When they see 10pt in a printed book (which as you know
    is quite common) they rarely respond to the style. Instead, they just read the
    text. Perhaps this is what Hrant means?\r\nThe major players in the bundling arena
    put in mostly readable fonts but add a few decorative and display faces too. I
    have seen plenty of lay users pick one of these non-text fonts for body text \"just
    to be different.\" There is nothing Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple can do to ensure
    that lay people use proper type for the job outside of not including any that
    don't work for text in their bundle. That would be a marketing mistake given your
    \"perceived and effective value.\" (I get really tired of seeing all certificates
    done in \"Chancery\" and \"Olde English\".)\r\nThere is nothing type designers
    can do to ensure good typography either. We can only do our best with the design
    and hope we don't have to see uses that make us cringe too often.\r\nChrisL"
