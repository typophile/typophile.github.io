body: This is a poster I did for an event at my school called "The Evening of Readings."
  I,ve done it five times now and it is very nerve racking. The reason I put the stool
  there is because when you read you sit on a stage with lights blinding you in front
  of the entire school and most of their parents, that stool is the stuff of nightmares.
  As you might have imagined those lines are supposed to represent the sound waves
  created during speech. Tell me what you think of it. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1-1_5941.png]
