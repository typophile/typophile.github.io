  time ago but I am looking for the closest possible typefaces if you guys have any
  suggestions.

  body: "Lovely Art Nouveau lettering. Several interesting alternatives with a similar
    feel, but not quite as vertical. Bonnard by Casady & Greene http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/
    Regina Cursive http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/regina-cursiv/ and virtually
    the same font under the name of Toffee Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/toffee-script/
    as well as Spring#7 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jmaul/spring7/\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Great finds donshottype! Those feel quite similar. They have a certain imperfection
    to them which I can appreciate. They remind me of a more restrained version of
    Lazybones http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/lazybones/

  body: Ryuk, Grocers Script actually reminds me a lot of OPTI Fonts <a href="http://opti.netii.net/fonts-m/index.htm">Morgan
    Fifty Nine</a>.  Grocers Script says it was discovered on the market Cours Saleya
    in Nice and was Designed in 2004 according to MyFonts where as the Castcraft/OPTI
    version says Copyright 1990-1991. I wonder what the real source of this typeface
    is.

  body: "Lots of similarities between Gert Wiescher's Grocers Script, based on lettering
    in a market in Nice, OPTI Morgan Fifty Nine, and Graphic Stylin NF. The clue to
    the reason for the similarities is that like Nick's  Graphic Stylin the other
    two fonts seem to be also derived from the Inserat Cursive script of the late
    19th century. Many of the alphabets of that era were published in showcard lettering
    sheets and books. In some way or another at least some of the design apparently
    filtered down to Gert's grocer in Nice. OPTI Morgan Fifty Nine is probably based
    on a printed alphabet or perhaps even a type specimen. Interesting.\r\nSo, the
    real source of this batch of fonts probably lies with whomever designed Inserat
    Cursive.\r\nBut then again, I could be wrong and the close similarities are purely
    coincidence...\r\nDon"
