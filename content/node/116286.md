  followed by Latin. How so?\r\n(1) Well, we know that Aleph is composed of two Yuds
  - one high and one low. If we join them using a horizontal\r\nrather than a diagonal
  we get a wind handle. Then reversing we get Lamed. I.e. Lamed=-Aleph\r\nSimilarly,
  (2) Daled is not really a door but a detonation handle - hence Delet=hole in wall=\"Delete\".
  I.e. the hole in the concept of Daled is not in the innards of the letter "

    writing system.\r\n\r\n1) How many writing systems have you studied?\r\n\r\n2)
    What are the pros/cons of a writing system being constructed?\r\n\r\nIn my view
    Hebrew is a writing system naturally inclined towards large, bold display setting,
    but less inclined towards setting for immersive reading. And it's interesting
    that its sister, Arabic, is the other way around.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
