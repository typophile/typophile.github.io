    the so-called New Century \u2013 a time in the (hopefully) distant future \u2014

    are aiming beyond that and always willing to explore new possibilities and fascinating

    rough drafts of Slasher covers due to appear in approx. 2152 AD (given that the
    editors are still alive then).\r\n\r\nAppypollyloggies if anyone is offended by

    is their lowest common denominator so to speak. They already live and breathe
    slashing, so nobody needs to tell them shit about slashing. What Slasher does
    is introduce them to new techniques from the unique perspective of a slasher.

    I figure, more oft than not, ''slashers'' aren''t big on advertising the fact

    why I stuck with just embellishing the A there within the sharp, straight-and-narrow
    rest of it; second, there''s just a slight nod to HUSTLER magazine there with
    my font choice (fairly basic but classier), as I''m guessing slashers get off
    on their evil acts, as do - if this were just a mag for horror fans - horror fans

    me it reads "SIASHER."

    am with Joe on this one - Aaron's first entry is SOLID, actually both are. And
    I'm thrilled to see that Randy is using his own blood! Way to invest yourself
    into your work ;)\r\n\r\nThe rest of y'all better get yer gloves out and throw
    some fancy punches if you plan on takin' this one.\r\n\r\n(I love the battles
    because it allows me to use made-up wordz and talk trash)"

    of type. The only thing is that it feels too mid-century modern. Maybe a combo
    of this concept with Jan's and itc_James take on it. (which are both great, BTW)\r\n\r\nJonE."

    inventive, but with all the fabulous blood and chocolate drippings, I thought
    there might be an alternative. Commercialism isn't as outwardly disturbing as
    an ax, but it can be equally as devastating."
