body: "As designers and typographers, we all encounter moments where we need to make
  a decision on the mixing and matching of typefaces. And as purveyors of the letterform,
  we also know that it is not just a matter of throwing two typefaces together.\r\n\r\nWhile
  it is not a perfect science, establishing a good, functional match between two different
  typefaces is akin to striking design gold. It is an acquired skill to master as
  there are steadfast rules and tips to follow, but at the same time these rules need
  not hold back your creative sense of adventure.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this thread
  was to start a dialogue where any us can discuss, inspire and display their favorites
  \"mixes and matches\" of typefaces. Pairs that have been your tried and true solutions
  in a pinch, or ones that are on the edge of reason yet still seems to ignite an
  excitement of our creative senses. The most conservative or the most experimental
  matches are welcome\r\n\r\nI'd would like to begin with a pair of typefaces that
  I recently felt has become a very tight and strong pairing after weeks of research
  and experimentation.\r\n\r\nBerthold Akzidenz Grotesk with Hoefler text. A marriage
  of a mid-century classic to a modern take (and homage) to the typestyles of the
  Transitional Period. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berthold_AG_4087.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hoefler_3890.gif]\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Good idea for a discussion, Alvin. It will be even more useful and revealing
    if there are some broad guidelines for those wanting to respond with samples of
    their pairs, such as: display the two typefaces in the same line or at least at
    the same size.'

  body: "Hi Stephen,\r\n\r\nAs far as any guidelines, your suggestions are ideal\r\n\r\n1.
    Displaying typefaces on the same line.\r\n2. Displaying typefaces at the same
    size.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of flexibility with this discussion as far as how
    one can display their samples. Other suggestions are as follows:\r\n\r\n3. Show
    the typeface pairing in a text block sample (paragraph, headlines, etc.) that
    highlights the pairings. \r\n4. A photo or screenshot of the typeface pairs in
    real use (current or past projects, logos, etc.).\r\n5. A photo or screen shot
    of found typography pairs (signage, billboards, posters, ads, etc.).\r\n6. Or
    even as simple just having a single word formatted in each typeface sample next
    to each other.\r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone wants to really add to this thread, they
    can also explain why they feel their samples works for them.\r\n\r\nHope to see
    some great pairs!\r\n\r\n~ A\r\n\r\n\r\n"
