  body: "Excellent find, Chris. I'd seen the previous project on Roman stilus tablets,
    but not the newer Greek stuff.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, I learned a new word this
    year: stoichedon, which refers to ancient Greek inscriptions in which the letters
    are arranged in a grid of vertical columns as well as horizontal lines (they are
    still read horizontally). There are some good examples in the Oxford image bank."
