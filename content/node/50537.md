body: "Hi,\r\nI'd like to get your thoughts on this design I drew up.  The focus of
  the label is old-time American folk, pre-war/post-war blues, and the like.  My aim
  is to create a clean script logotype, with some of the quirks and charm of a hand
  drawn logo of that era, while still looking well-crafted.\r\n\r\nAnything you would
  change in the weights, kerning, curves? Should I round out the hard edges?  I will
  be staring at it until it looks perfect.  This started as a (crude) hand-drawn sketch
  and was traced.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n-David\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numerophon-clean-3_5198.jpg]"

    your second opinion forced me into seeking some solutions for it.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a modification.  At the moment I'm not sure about the top terminal of the m, and
    the bottom terminal of the h is bothering me a bit.  Suggestions would be greatly
    appreciated.\r\n\r\n*Further modifications: a less robust p, spacing increased
    between o and n--considering tighter spacing between u and m\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numerophon-clean-4_4127.jpg]"

    is for it to fit prominently on an album's label without having it shrunken down
    too much, as it's a pretty long word.\r\n\r\nI did condense the p a bit in the
    2nd iteration shown here.  Do you think I should narrow it a smidgen more?"

  body: "Edit: Before you even read this David I am humbly trying to help. My background
    is in hand lettering\r\n\r\nYou are mixing styles David. Part of it is italic(Arrighi)
    and part modern (Bodoni) or even Old style.. I think that is where the disconnect
    comes in for me. Look at your branching... they do not match. Look at your bowls...
    they do not match the other letters. The u does not reflect the h, n and m. The
    e,r o and p do not match the m,n, and h. The bowl of the e is way to large. And
    the r is a script r... based on the n,m,h it would have to be an italic r.\r\n\r\nChoose
    what style you are trying to convey. Don't get me wrong, I like where you are
    going it just has to have continuity. \r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Thanks for the advice, Michael.\r\n\r\nI personally think a design like this
    allows for some mixing of styles, but do agree with you that the bowls should
    match with everything.  Harmony with the curves, weights, heights and kerning
    are the most important to me. The label covers different styles within a semi-specific
    era, so I think some mixing of typographic styles may not be too harmful, and
    may hopefully give it some character.  I originally had more of an italic r, but
    it seemed to stagger the rhythm a bit.\r\n\r\nI am curious about how the u doesn't
    reflect the m, h, and n.  This is definitely not the only thing I do, so I appreciate
    hearing what stands out to you.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numerophon-clean-5_6161.jpg]"

    be careful that you don't lose that hand-drawn feel. I don't think you've lost

    a line to rest your characters on, some would dip slightly and some almost twice
    as much... That doesn't seem right. I would say, nothing should dip lower than
    the o's, for visual reasons.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? There seems to be a
    lack of consistency."

    of the letter shapes. And as I go back and re-read Michael's crit he does say
    they do not have to match. The bouncy baseline does not bother me so much, it
    seems musical. You do say you want to create a well-crafted script logotype with
    some hand drawn quirkiness. It's up to you to determine the balance between well-crafted
    and quirky. The one thing that appears discordant to me, is the o with a line
    through it. It looks like a character from a Cyrillic alphabet. \u0444  The overall
    impression I get is Russian music not American folk & blues.  "

  body: "Thanks everyone for giving your eyes to this.\r\n\r\n@Robby: I think taking
    a step away from this and returning to it would be a good thing (it's only been
    48 hours since its initial rendering).  I do feel that the more refinements that
    are made, the less charm it has, but the control does become appealing in it's
    own right.  It will be good for me to understand for myself just how much control
    there should be.  The logos for many of the labels releasing blues and folk music
    on 78s have a very innocent charm to them, but at the same time it is apparent
    that the lettersmith behind them is trained and skilled.  Though charming as they
    are, they're definitely not heavy-handed.\r\n\r\nexamples:\r\n[[http://tedstaunton.com/labels/1930-1939.pages/Melotone/image/melotone.gif|melotone]]\r\n[[http://tedstaunton.com/labels/1930-1939.pages/Panachord/image/panachord.gif|panachord]]\r\n[[http://tedstaunton.com/labels/1930-1939.pages/Superior/image/superior.gif|superior]]\r\n[[http://tedstaunton.com/labels/1930-1939.pages/Brunswick.1930.1939/image/brunswick.1930.1939.gif|brunswick]]\r\n\r\nI
    agree that this is a great committee to process things through, and what I take
    from it is very valuable, especially when it comes to the little nip/tucks.  Though
    some things should be taken with a grain of salt, I do appreciate tremendously
    what more experienced folks have to say.  I'm always looking to learn and understand
    my own limitations.\r\n\r\n@asvetic: good point in making the o's a bit larger.
    \ I do like bobbling baseline, but limiting the occurences of the swoop down would
    make those occasions more powerful and less sloppy. ie. raising the connecting
    stroke of the m, but leaving the e and h.\r\n\r\n@pica: there's definitely something
    happening with the p-h.  I think creating the stop there helps the eye in reading
    this correctly, and the descender/ascender matching is intended to unify the letters
    to each other.  Though, I am unsure of the bottom-left of that h.  It leaves less
    white space than every other letter-to-letter connection. \r\n\r\n@kirsten: my
    intention for the line through the o is to signify the numeral zero, known to
    have a slash-through at times.  I am however sensitive of my own association with
    labels ending in 'phon' being of eastern-European origin.\r\n\r\nProgress to come
    shortly!"

    at the correct size for them yet? A 12\" label is just 4\" diameter, so you can
    probably fit this across 3\" without the centre hole cutting anything off. Do
    you think you might lose the fine stroke of the r and the one across the first
    o at that size? Even on a CD you couldn't be much wider than 4\".\r\n\r\nI love
    what you have done. To me the o's also have a music notation look and I like the
