  practices) indicated that the correct glyph name for, say, U+00B2 is /two.superior.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  a little confused. According to <cite>Unicode and Glyph Names</cite> [Document version
  2.3, Last upated April 17, 2003], \u201CThe specification consists of the Adobe
  Glyph List (AGL), a mapping of specific names to Unicode values, and of rules for
  decomposing glyph names. . . . This specification is intended to be stable, i.e.,
  never revised.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow this covers the <cite>rules</cite> for decomposing
  glyph names, not the naming practices that may change from time to time, so that\u2019s
  all right.\r\n\r\nBut one of the rules is \u201Cdrop all the characters from the
  glyph name starting with the first occurrence of a period (U+002E FULL STOP), if
  any.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo, the glyph string\r\n\r\n/one/zero/two.superior\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n/one/zero/two\r\n\r\nor
  102. Much different than 10^2\r\n\r\non the other hand, /one/zero/twosuperior\r\n\r\nis
  perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nThe only reason we worry about glyph names occurs when we
  are trying to derive character information from a glyph list, right? And practically
  speaking, the only time this comes up is with Acrobat, right? And one of the features
  of Distiller is that a cmap is made a part of the PDF file, so the only time we\u2019re
  going to have to construct character information from a glyph list from glyph names
  themselves is when that cmap is missing or damaged.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here?\r\n"

  body: "Charles, \r\n\r\nyour analysis is correct. Mapping of \"two.superior\" to
    U+00B2 is semantically inconsistent. To be fully faithful to their principles,
    Adobe should have a glyph \"twosuperior\" or \"uni00B2\" mapped to U+00B2, and
    an identical duplicate, \"two.superior\" or \"two.sups\", unencoded. Only the
    latter would be used in OpenType Layout features such as sups. \r\n\r\nA."
