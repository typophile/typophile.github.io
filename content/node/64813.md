  body: "The leading is not a Fontlab matter, it is changed in your layout software
    (Illustrator, Indesign, etc.). What you can manage in Fontlab is vertical metrics.
    It\u2019s been a recurrent subject here in Typophile:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/search/?keys=vertical%20metrics\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"
