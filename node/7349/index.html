  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Now that InDesign 2 and Photoshop 7 support OpenType, does anybody around here have a clue when we can expect OpenType support in Illustrator? Couldn't find anything on their website. <BR> <BR>I'm considering upgrading my license for Mrs Eaves to the OpenType version and purchasing a license to Neutraface. As I'm doing almost all my single page work in Illustrator, this is important information to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Illustrator first needs to be updated to handle Unicode text input and processing, once that is in place (or at the same time) Adobe will doubtless start adding OpenType Layout support. Rewriting core text handling for an application is a major job, which can easily take more than one typical rev cycle. I know Adobe won't make any public statements about this, but my guess is that they are actively working on updating the text engine for Illustrator. I'm hoping that we'll see the results in the next release.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At the risk of souding like a salesman, they way we are handling the issue with illustrator is that we bundle the &quot;Neutraface Standard&quot; fonts with the &quot;Neutraface Expert&quot; collection. So if you wanted to specify, for example, small cap tabular figures in NeutraText Bold in Illustrator, you'd have to use the &quot;Standard&quot; fonts (which, incidently, also ship in .otf format only). If you wanted to do the same in InDesign, it's as simple as invoking a few features with the NeutraText Expert counterpart. Both collections (Standard and Expert) will coexist peacefully in the type menu. Drawback is that you have a boatload of fonts added to your menu&hellip;the full Neutraface Standard collection is 85 fonts (OpenType programming in the Expert collection trims it down to 29). <BR> <BR>At this point, we are telling people who have no intention of using InDesign that they should not bother spending the extra 50 bones for the Expert collection at this point. We also tell them that we'll &quot;upgrade&quot; them to the Expert collection for the $50 difference if they change their mind down the road. <BR> <BR>Not having OT support in AI is a bummer, but I'm sure Adobe will have it in subsequent versions, especially since all of their new collections since 1999 ship in OpenType only format.</div>

I need to hurry to upgrade my home copy to version 10.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; [Ciao Jon, welcome! This is very stupid of Macromedia. Before InDesign, and even after it, FreeHand was the only program handling complex graphic design and excellent typographic layout capabilities at the same time. No Opentype support is a really stupid move. But I'm just glad they haven't discontinued it for now. Before InDesign there was no program allowing you to force punctuation out of justified text, for better alignment, or to adjust so finely tracking and other type issues. I have been a PageMaker user since version 3 (back in 1988) and I welcomed InDesign as a fantastic step forward. But if you do things like packaging, where the complex handling of graphics is often paired with the need of great typographic control, FreeHand is invaluable.]</div>

If Adobe adds multi-pages-of-various-size-in-one-document, OpenType and a bit more speed to Illustrator, that'll be it for me and I'll switch, I do most of my work in InDesign these days anyway&hellip; (oh well, at least the upgrade from FH 10 to 11 isn't too expensive :-))</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; [From what John Hudson has told me, InDesign ME (Middle East) is even better than the international Adobe version. It's been developed by a third-party software firm for offering support for indic scripts and it's probably the state of the art of layout programs today. I wonder if as an InDesign registered user I could get an upgrade. I'm on a Mac, anyway. I don't know if InDesign ME exists for both platforms&hellip; FreeHand will always be in my heart, anyway. I recalled when I started using FreeHand 2.0.2 in awe. At the time, PageMaker 3.0 didn't allowed color separations, rotations, and it allowed only point size increments of 1: 11 pts or 12 pts, etc&hellip; Anyway, just as a reminder: FreeHand offered color separations from within the program since 1988/89 while for Illustrator people had to wait until release 5 or 6 if I recall correctly. And version 6 still didn't allowed the import of tiff files. Illustrator is good for Illustrations. FreeHand might go away, but it's been a landmark for designers and typographers as well&hellip;]</div>
