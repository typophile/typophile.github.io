  &#40;but not in the slab serifed sort of way&#41;. <BR> <BR>I am developing a wordmark
  for a holding company with a name comprised of three sets of initials of the owners
  &#40;what&#39;s worse, is that there is a backslash after the first three&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>The saving gRace &#40;or the solution&#41; may be in the use of a capital
  &#34;R,&#34; which appears after the backslash. <BR> <BR>After searching through
  Rockledge, Font Bureau&#39;s spec book &#40;3rd edition&#41;, and hundreds of Fonts
  on our sponsor, Font Shop, I am missing something: the capital &#34;R&#34; with
  a long flowing extender that will add grace, elegance, and dignity to the wordmark.
  Fortunately, after the cap R, two lowercase letters w/out descenders follow. <BR>
  <BR>As of yet, I am not sure with this is going to be all-caps &#40;not preferred&#41;,
  initials w/small caps, or U/L.... <BR> <BR>A titling font would be okay, but the
  face has to work on a business card and its vertical stressors, IMHO, shouldn&#39;t
  be too heavy in contrast for it to work on da web. <BR> <BR>The cap &#34;R&#34;
  in BEMBO is nice, but, to me, even with proper kerning, it looks off... &#40;Oh,
  the &#34;R&#34; is followed by an &#34;i.&#34; &#41; <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?  A
  gold dubloon or sort of compensation/contribution may be in order, even if its to
  &#34;typophile.com.&#34; <BR> <BR>Thanking you in advance for your help and careful
  consideration. Geo.'

  body: How about Adobe Caslon Swash? You could add the swash to a regular cap R,
    so you&#39;d loose the swash on the left...

  body: How long an R do you need? The cap R in <a href="http://www.fonts.com/fontlist/406624-mantinia.html">Mantinia</a>
    has a nice leg to it, but if you needed something really long you could graft
    a piece of the extended Q onto it.

    Requiem</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/centaur/" target="_blank">Centaur</a>
    have nice R legs too but I was thinking same - why not take a font that you like
    for all your purposes and then just modify the R for the logo? It&#39;s more original
    to customize a font for a logo than just using it as is.
