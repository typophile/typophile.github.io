body: "I am currently writing a  short dissertation about if / how Blackletter and
  especially Fraktur gains back importance to current design and typography, and whether
  or not Fraktur can leave its poor national-socialistic associations behind. Now
  I am looking for contemporary sources whether Blackletter has been used in advertising,
  branding, fashion, music or modern typefaces http://www.typetype.com/cat/neutrum.html
  ; basically in anything that has been created in the last 10 years. \r\nGenerally
  I am looking for some more 'mainstream' examples and I remember that for example
  Nike did some ads using Fraktur a few years ago. \r\nDoes anybody know of further
  examples?\r\n\r\nJo."
