    vs. font explanation. \r\nI'm using Firefox on Windows 7, and the mouseover part
    doesn't work."

  body: A good, terse, effective, introduction. I'm also using Firefox on Windows
    7, and the mouseovers work fine for me. I think that some of the text samples
    (on the right) are too small and too dense to be seen easily, In particular, it's
    very hard to distinguish the three different justification examples - hard to
    see the title and hard to see the differences.  - Herb

    body: Thanks Herb. Are you talking about when you click on the examples, or just
      the thumbnails themselves?

  body: I was referring to the thumbnails - quite honestly I didn't even realize they
    could be clicked on! However, my comment on the alignment examples still holds.
    They aren't sufficiently ragged to be noticeable. Similarly, the rivers aren't
    wide enough or long enough to be really disturbing (even if they're quite realistic).
    Pedagogically, exaggeration can be more effective than subtlety.

    sorry about that. The text describes typographic terms with examples folded into
    the text. F.ex., the paragraph on rivers (flod)... well, a river runs through
    it."

  body: "\"the basics of type in a super dumbed down way\"\r\n\r\nI think you succeeded
    in doing that \u2014 but who is your target audience supposed to be? Are the people
    whom you want to read your site likely to want things presented in a dumbed down
    way?\r\n\r\nI think there's a fine line between simple, laid back, and easily
    understood vs. patronizing. I'd be wary which side of the line you fall on \u2014
    it's always good to be funny, but being \"fun\" in the way you're being might
    suggest \"childish\" or an attitude of talking down.\r\n\r\nAs an exercise, it's
    well done."

  body: "Excellent work! One thing struck me as odd, though: in the Anatomy section,
    the bracket marking the ascender of \u2018l\u2019 only includes the part extending
    above the H-height. In my opinion, it should include everything above the x-height."
