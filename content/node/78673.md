  the logo?\r\n\r\n2. Is there a font similar to this one but smooth? (i.e. a sans-serif
  without any of the grittieness)\r\n\r\nI would be very grateful for any assistance.
  \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\nAdonyao"

    02</a>. Its letterforms come from <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?GL7">Helvetica</a>
    by Max Miedinger. The font itself was printed on paper, then the paper crushed
    and sprayed with white colour, the result scanned and newly digitized if I recall
    it correctly from a forum thread. '
