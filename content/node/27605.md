    background on some of his Pentagram stuff. Robin Williams didn't make it (due
    to travel issues). \r\n\r\nThe Font Management panel is just wrapping up - these
    TypeCon panels are great, goes back to the old-days of TypeCon when you had mostly
    panel discussions and a few real talks.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n"

    and as much as I enjoyed the early days of twenty or thirty people, even then
    I wished that more people could have enjoyed the event. I guess that's the trade-off."

  body: I'm putting in for vacation time as soon as I get in. So sorry I couldn't
    be in Boston with y'all -- especially since I couldn't go because of an event
    that would have been tonight had it not been canceled a week and a half ago. Next
    year, barring an extraordinary life event, no such barriers will be allowed. I'll
    even make my new intern start a week late to accommodate TypeCon.
