    ;-)\r\n\r\nSeriously the only font business I know of that displays the BBB logo
    is Ascender... http://www.ascendercorp.com/index.html - there may be others, but
    starting an e-commerce font business from the ground up probably required it?\r\n"

  body: "I know that Monotype belongs. I hadn't put in the whole who's who yet. Mostly
    because I was wondering if it is a factor in anybody's thinking in the Font Biz.
    \r\n\r\nFor instance, would you Si, look someone up that way or react one way
    or the other to seeing it on a subcontractor's web page? I am guessing not. I
    could see where it might (maybe) make a difference to a foundry especially a small
    one. But my gut is that people come to Typophile or other forums and ask around...
    Or they do even less.  \r\n\r\nA thread like this can't answer these questions
    definitively but it might help to get insight. So am I right in thinking that
    you think it's mostly a font customer & foundry issue if it's one at all?"

  body: The Better Business Bureau is somewhat of a scam, from what I've heard. You
    pay your annual dues and get a little plaque, but they don't really do anything
    to verify that you're not a con artist. It's somewhat akin to having a business
    card -- it might convey professionalism, but in no way does it guarantee it.
