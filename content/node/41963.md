  contest (I got both my entries in the finals - w00t!).\r\n\r\nAnyway, a friend of
  mine would like to know what the title font is being used on [[http://www.teamxray.com/teamxray/m_intro.php?Xnet_Session=051b674349aa40b1cb9bdc109f5296c3|this
  site]]. Like, for instance, \"M18TPRO\", \"COLUMN #15\", and \"MULTI-FLEX\".\r\n\r\nThanks."
