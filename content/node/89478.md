body: "Hi typophiles,\r\n\r\nHow big no-no it would be to use the horizontal terminal
  in \"a\"? Other glyphs have a angled terminal. In the second image, the \"a\" is
  also angled.  Does this look better to you? I'm wondering this because the arm of
  the \"a\" points to left, where all similar shapes in other glyphs point to right.
  So in both cases this terminal of the \"a\" will differ from the other glyphs. On
  its own, i think the horizontal \"a\" looks way more beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhich one
  would you choose? Do you see any other solutions?"

  body: Yes, angled. It's a consistency thing. The horizontal cut makes it look like
    the "a" belongs to a different typeface.

    it. Thanks!

    would you really say what he's proposing in the second one would work in a text

    After all the power\r\nof style is proportional to size, and when you get small\r\nenough

    it moves into the realm\r\nof unconscious texture, metamorphosing if you will.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'No intention to do a text face here! I too like my "a"s like that, but maybe
    it''s good to compromise in this case as the "a" is such a characteristic glyph
    for the typeface. But just a thought: is it really more consistent to have a one
    left-pointing angled terminal only in one glyph in a font?  After all, there is
    numerous horizontal lines all throughout the font, in almost every glyph? Excuse
    me, I''m just a beginner...'
