  body: "That's exactly the problem, Nick. I attached the image to illustrate what
    I meant, but I had to set the extra point by hand which is why it's not entirely
    straight. The first curve is the one I have & the second one is what I'd like
    to achieve. The bounding box is the box that \"holds\" your selection.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BoundingBox_3697.jpg]\r\nI'm
    trying to find a way to (automatically) add points where the object & its bounding
    box intersect."

  body: "The only way I've noticed Illustrator adding anchor points automatically
    is if you trim or divide an object with the pathfinder tool. \r\n\r\nThe way I'd
    do it manually would be: define the bounding box with guides (this will give you
    your touching edges), then from the tool palette select the add anchor pen tool
    (pen with the plus sign). You can add an anchor point anywhere on a path (not
    just centered between the 2 closest points) and as many as you want.\r\n"

  body: I usually use the pathfinder for adding points where necessary as well, but
    it doens't always work... Even when you copy/paste the exact x- & y-coordinates,
    sometimes the pathfinder won't "cut" the shapes. Very frustrating when even computers
    turn out to be not entirely flawless ;-)

    body: Tnx for help but, after setting new anchor point manually at the crossing
      of two straight lines I have to cut off one side of the lines and make the lines
      join at the intersection which means that if I want a nice corner join I should
      have ending points of each line (after cutting) exactly one above the other
      (or at the same spot) and that's something I simply can't do by hand (the lines
      ofcourse must not be moved during the process). Any other suggestions?

  body: I honestly can't remember why I posted this question here, Chris, but I do
    remember that it would've come in handy at the thing I was working on at the time.
    Still, it seems odd to me that there's no way of doing this in Illustrator & I
    can still see how it can be usefull in many cases.

  body: "Well, you can try this. Makes sure your lines have a stroke on them, select
    them all and then go to the Pathfinder palette, select Crop. The stroke will reset
    to None but you'll now have 4 individual lines instead of the 2 intersecting.
    Also, this will make them a temporary group, just un-group them before you delete
    the lines you want to remove.\r\n\r\nThen you can use the direct select (white
    arrow) to select the two end points you want to rejoin, and press Ctrl+J or Cmd+J
    on a MAC.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't what you're looking for, then I'm not sure I understand
    what you're asking to do. That is about as Automatic as it's going to get in Illustrator.\r\n\r\n"
