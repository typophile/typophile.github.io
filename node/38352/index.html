<p>I am working on a new logo for a promotion and modelling agency based in Germany. What they do is essentially providing promotion / trade fair / modelling personnel to large companies.

First, the gradient suggest the letters are on a curved surface, yet they&rsquo;re not slightly warped as they should be &ndash; if you put a chess board on a spherical surface, the squares won&rsquo;t be square any more, right? Second, the letters &ldquo;DOCK&rdquo; are plain white without any gradient, which is wrong &ndash; just like the black background, even originally plain white area get a gradient if the surface isn&rsquo;t flat.</p>
<p>3-D effects are tricky to get right, and they&rsquo;re guaranteed to give you headaches to get printed right. So unless your logo is primarily used on screen (which doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case according to your description), you should re-think at least three times if it&rsquo;s worth the trouble.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re misreading it &ndash; I take the white to be not a different color on the surface of the curved thing, but rather cut-out empty space. So the PROMO is like a plug that will go into the DOCK socket. (But maybe the designer should take this misreading as a warning.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd - I feel like the gradient on PROMO is very dated looking (in a kind of early-80s-Radio-Shack home-computer-ad way), and the one around DOCK is very trendy looking (kind of iPhonish).</p>

<p>To be clear, we&rsquo;re not talking about &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo;, but &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; in this case. The word &ldquo;sophistication&rdquo; should be used to describe an inevitably complex solution to a complex problem. Obviously, that requires great skill. But the more basic and more important skill is to recognize how complex the problem is in the first place.

<p>It seems to me that you just jumped right into designing the logo without thinking about what you want the logo to convey. Throw this iteration out and think about the logo again from scratch. Who is the audience? What do you want them to think of when they see the logo? Are there any other businesses providing the same service? What do their logos say to you? &amp;c.</p>

<p>The word “sophistication” should be used to describe an inevitably complex solution to a complex problem.
Sophisticated vs. complicated, complexity vs. appropriate solution</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t something be sophisticated yet simple? The implications above are that anything that is sophisticated is therefore complex, and anything complex, that is executed well, is therefore sophisticated. I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of good design that is complex, yet not sophisticated. I feel sophistication is more like elegance or boldness. While it is a trait often desired, it is not inherent in every (good, complex) design, nor should it be. Similarly, elegance is something to be admired, but it is not necessarily appropriate in every situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are they sophisticated or simple?
I think your list includes many logos that are both, and some that are one or the other (easyJet, for example, while simple, is more casual than sophisticated).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with hola that the font choice is a little too heavy. Maybe even try a serif? Although knowing more about the company and its personality would certainly help.</p>
