body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nwhat would you propose as an alternative to the common Minion/Myriad-
  and Sabon/Syntax-combos?\r\n\r\nThe application would be mainly technical project
  reports, several dozens to sometimes a few hundred pages, typeset with LaTeX on
  A4 paper, in two columns or with wide margins, 10 to 12 pt, with loads of tables,
  figures, \"in-text-markup\", etc. Sometimes read as PDF on screen, but mostly printed
  with \"office\" printers (laser). Also, as secondary applications, presentations,
  letters and similar \"office\" documents. European readers, German, English, French
  language.\r\n\r\nThe criteria would be:\r\n- Readability. Should be as easy as prose,
  as far as technically possible under these conditions. Whether these documents get
  actually read or not makes a _significant_ \"competitive advantage\". In the industry
  nearly everyone uses a certain \"text processor\" for these applications and certain
  \"typefaces\", together with a certain type of \"layout\", and as a result, the
  documents are simply _never_ actually read.\r\n- Features: Both serif and sans should
  be available at least as regular, italic, semibold, semibold italic, with oldstyle
  figures and small caps at least in the regular weight, both upright and italic.
  A variant appropriately spaced for headlines would be nice to have for the sans.\r\n-
  \"Garalde\" look (and \"feel\") for the serif. Preferably as bright as possible
  without compromising legibility too much.\r\n- The sans should also be suitable
  as main text typeface for certain applications.\r\n- Opentype postscript flavor
  for integration with LaTeX.\r\n- The typefaces in question shouldn't be as common
  as Minion/Myriad or Sabon/Syntax, that's why I am asking here. ;-)\r\n\r\nI've had
  a look at the \"similar fonts\" at myfonts.com and identifont.com already, also
  at the families of \"companion\" sans and serifs at identifont.com. And while I
  do like quite a few of the sans typefaces listed there (Celeste, Charlotte, Freight...)
  I haven't managed to find a matching serif typeface that I really do like. I definitely
  do not like the serif members of \"corporate identity\" families such as Thesis,
  Corporate ASE, Nexus, Generis, Meta, etc...\r\n\r\nAny proposals?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWolfgang\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  I'm a typographic layman, and I don't have the possibility to test these fonts,
  that's why I hope to get competent advice from experienced users of various relevant
  typefaces here..."

    Lyon and Pona, \r\nMVB Verdigris has no semibold, but does have italic small caps.
    It is a rather dark text font though. \r\n\r\nAs for the Sans, any humanistic
    Sans would work. Nick Shinn's Sensibility, Stella, Mundo, PF Centro Sans, Depot
    New. As well the Office 2007 bundled Clear Type fonts Corbel and Calibri are part
    of the humanistic \"Frutiger-alike\" genre. New and interesting is the stressed

    I haven't managed to find a PDF specimen to test it in print... :-(\r\n\r\nLyon
    and Pona also look nice. Much better to my eyes than the average \"corporate\"
    typefaces that I have found so far.\r\n\r\nFor the sans, imho the point is to
    find one that matches color and metrics of the serif as far as possible, and this
    in both weights (regular, semibold) and shapes (upright, italic). And without
    the possibility to actually test the combination myself... :-/\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWolfgang\r\n\r\nP.S.:
    You didn't advertise Andron because you don't want it to get abused by amateurs

  body: "Apparently, Andron doesn't have italic small caps anyway. Why I need these?
    For acronyms/abbreviations (I have L-O-A-D-S of these in my documents) in blocks
    of italics text, such as quoted text, margin notes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fact that
    Andron doesn't have a sans that's made specifically for it wouldn't matter to
    me, I'm not looking exclusively for purpose-made \"superfamilies\". Sabon and
    Syntax were made by different designers, yet as far as I understand they seem
    to be generally considered as The Reference for documents like the ones that I
    mostly write. \r\n\r\nAnd it doesn't have to be typefaces that were released recently.
    For example, if you know of a nice matching sans for Albertina... Would Today
    work? I picked these two from the \"Schriftwechsel\" book, and Albertina also
    from the \"Textism\" web site. I have no clue how they would work for my kind
    of application, however, especially with office printers.\r\n\r\nI have also come
    across Epic and Organic (from Typetrust) by chance. What do you think about them?
    Epic looks to me essentially like \"a better Garamond than Garamond\".\r\n\r\nCalluna
    looks a bit too idiosyncratic to me with that asymmetric \"twist\" in the connection
    between the lower serifs and the stems.\r\n\r\nAnd Centro looks a bit too \"slabby\"
    for my taste.\r\n\r\nSo, if you know of more such \"hidden gems\" like \r\n- Novel,\r\n-
    Lyon (matching sans?),\r\n- Pona (Orenga is beautiful - does it pair up with Pona?)\r\nkeep
    them coming! :-)\r\n\r\nAs for the sans; I do like Stella, Mundo, Depot New a
    lot, thanks for those.\r\n\r\nUnd Gr\xFC\xDFe in das Land wo die krossen Chicas
    auf den Palmen wachsen. ;-)"

  body: "Epic seems to be more a reinterpretation of Sabon, with new italics, than
    any other Garamond-type. This is interesting, as somehow Epic seems to be more
    close to Sabon than the revival of Sabon Next. In any case I am not qualified
    to assess the quality of how the typeface is crafted (outlines, spacing, kerning,
    etc...). \r\n\r\nAs well it seems to me that Epic is different than other typefaces
    (and Sabon) in the size and position of the German Umlaut dots in comparison to
    the i dot. I mention it as it seems like we share the same mother tongue. \r\n\r\nAll
    in all it seems to me a useable typeface. \r\n\r\nSomething else that fits your
    criteria is FF Celeste, which has a [[https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/celeste|serif]],
    [[https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/celeste-small-text|small-text (serif)]] and a
    [[https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/celeste-sans|sans face]]. Celeste takes more
    inspiration of the modern era. It is a good text face though and very suitable.
    It does not need to be a Garalde. (EDIT: I just saw you mentioned Celeste in your
    original post. You said though that you did not find a matching serif you liked.
    That means you did realize that there are Freight and Celeste serif versions,
    but you did not like them, right? Just in case you did not notice.)\r\n\r\nDid
    you try to ask the designers of the serif typefaces, which fitting sans they recommend?
    \r\n\r\nAs well there is no real agreement on how to pair typefaces. I think it
    was Hrant here in this forum who said once that one should not aim for all too
    similar metrics and x-height. You can find more advise on pairing here: [[http://www.google.at/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=typeface+pair+OR+pairing+OR+match+OR+matching+OR+combining+OR+combination+OR+tango+site%3Atypophile.com|Typophile
