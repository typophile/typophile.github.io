    and Nik Thoenen has a similar feel but differs in one or the other detail. It
    may be a customised version.\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken, \u2018Strasse\u2019
    (instead of \u2018Stra\xDFe\u2019) is a Helvetian spelling variant. The company
    with a \u2018K\xE4ltezentrale\u2019 may reside in Switzerland. This makes the
    use of a Swiss typeface for their signage even more likely. Can you say where
    these photographs have been taken, breckon?"

  body: 'Sure, it''s a signage job by erwinbauer for the Novartis campus in Basel
    (right about the switzerland connection). I''ve asked them but no reply as yet,
    it''s very similar to DIN 16 (and the thinner weights of Chevin at a stretch)
    - could be a bespoke typeface for the job based on DIN? '
