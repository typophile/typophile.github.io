  the typeface and without '.com' in it. My eyes are really rusty, please give your
  appreciated advice.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAdam"

    uniform way to join the letters."

  body: I think there's something there. The "apped" goes well together, but the left
    side doesn't fit as nicely. I find it strange the C-l-a has letterspacing, and
    more than anything the "ta" has a sharp 90 degree angle that just shouldn't be
    there.

  body: "Oh help, is that <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/harabara.font\">Harabara</a>?\r\nTry
    actually using Helvetica. I know you're not supposed to change the font, but Harabara
    is nothing but a bad ripoff of Helvetica with some corners broken off, so the
    flavor isn't really going to change. You could still remove some parts and round
    some corners if needed, but it's very likely to end up cleaner."
