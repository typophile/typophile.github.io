I don&rsquo;t know which new testament interpretation you&rsquo;re using, but anything but the early 17th c. King James version written in blackletter just seems wrong and out of place to me.  Contemporary English in an antique typestyle seems self-contradictory.</p>
<p>I was also briefly confused  by the initial blackletter glyph.  The verse number appeared as the letter &lsquo;g&rsquo; rather than the number &lsquo;9&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><ul>
<li> As previously mentioned, blackletter only makes sense if you are attempting to reproduce some specific printing of the Bible.
<li> Your use of a bold weight within the body of your text is distracting.  Italics are a less disruptive way of providing emphasis.  Similarly, SHOUTING is rude.
<li> Small numbers should generally be written out; e.g., "2" in the first sentence should be "two".
<li> Consider block indenting long quotes.
<li>Your double quotes are a mix of straight quotes and curly ("typographer's") quotes.  You should choose one convention and stick with it; typographer's quotes lead to better looking spacing.
<li>Your measure is much too long.  You can fix this by increasing your left/right margins, and increasing the size of your type.
<li>Your top/bottom margins seem very narrow.  Play with them in order to choose a reasonable aspect ratio for your page space.
<li>The absence of hyphenation (and center justification) leads to very uneven spacing between words, which is disruptive.
<li>Try decreasing your inter-paragraph space and indenting your paragraphs; it would tend to flow better. 
<li>Your ordinal indicators could be written as superscripts.
<li>Play with your leading; it seems a bit large with your main body typeface (though not in the blackletter portions...)
<li>The center/bold section headings are rather typewriter-y.
</ul>
<p>These are just very quick comments. Many of the things that I&rsquo;ve commented on look like default settings rather than deliberate choices on your part; if this is so, you may want to consider going through a couple of books on typography and print design.  I&rsquo;ve found <cite>The Elements of Typographic Style</cite> by Robert Bringhurst an excellent and accessible introduction to typography in general, and <cite>Book Typography: A Designer&rsquo;s Manual</cite> by Michael Mitchell and Susan Wightman to be an excellent introduction to book design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The above opinions are solid, but mainstream. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blackletter <em>can</em> make sense beyond mere historicism - it has a flavor and relevance all its own. That said, it certainly is difficult finding a blackletter than can work in a sophisticated way.</li>
<li>Although Bold is indeed almost always too disruptive, do consider using a Demi for emphasis (if available). To me that&rsquo;s even more elegant and functional than using Italics.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Try something other than Times for your body text. A classic serifed font should work well. Perhaps then you can set the biblical extracts in a compatible sans serif — or vice versa.</p>
<p>I do think the blackletter is too disruptive and unreadable. I might simply use italics, or a second color. If you must use blackletter, though, why not find one that&rsquo;s more open and readable, like Clairvaux? Or simply set the titles (&ldquo;Acts 1:9–11&rdquo;) in blackletter, and leave the text in roman? Or just use a blackletter drop cap or something?</p>
<p>I recommend old-style (&ldquo;lowercase&rdquo;) numerals, and en dashes as opposed to hyphens in verse numbers. You use them sometimes, but not always.</p>
<p>You do not need quote marks around the biblical passages; a change of font (and, probably indent) is enough.</p>
<p>I would set the verse numbers in the text in a different color (red) or in light grey.</p>
<p>If you set the extracts narrower, with a large right margin, and the commentary narrower, with a large left margin, or some such arrangement, you could make an interesting visual alternation between text and commentary, while suggesting two columns or trains of thought.</p>
<p>The main thing, though, is to find an alternative to the blackletter you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>Super quick sample of a different approach, just to give you some things to think about:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The new version is a huge improvement. Well done.</p>
<p>I still would like to see oldstyle figures for verse numbers (which Times New Roman actually does have, in some versions), or at least reduced size lining figures.</p>
<p>The italic is much more readable than the blackletter, and the two-column setting helps.</p>
<p>Some of your quotes are still straight.</p>
<p>You might try reducing your type size by one or two points, but keeping the leading the same. I think that will greatly help your readability overall — smaller type, more space between the lines. This is generally easier to reads than large type, tightly spaced.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The bold type is a very bad idea: it fragments the text and actually reduces the readability of the document. As soon as one engages with the page, one&rsquo;s eye is drawn to these passages, but they don&rsquo;t make sense without the connecting text. This is lousy text articulation, and there is good reason why, in +550 years, this has never become one of the norms of typography.</p>
<p>As for reflecting a &lsquo;revolutionary&rsquo; content of the theology&hellip; well, no, it just makes you look like a typographical crank, the documentary equivalent of someone ranting on a street corner. Theological arguments must hold their own in the norms of reasoned discourse, and dressing them up with idiosyncratic emphasis is likely to make readers question that ability.</p>
