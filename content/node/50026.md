  an image of a page from the 1934 ATF specimen in a revival of a typeface. First,
  is there even anyone to get permission from? Second, has anyone ever checked to
  see if ATF even bothered to renew the copyrights for it\u2019s books? Last, I feel
  that if I reprint a single page for the purpose of comparing letters on it with
  a revival I\u2019m covered under fair use. Does anyone disagree?"

  body: "I think this is a perfect case of fair use. You'll be copying one page, the
    copying will not affect the sales of the remnants of ATF. If this is a noncommercial,
    educational work, it's even better.\r\n\r\nGo [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use|here]]
    for details.\r\n\r\nConsidering how unpredictable the courts are in judging cases
    of copyright infringement, many publishers ignore the fair use option and just
    don't print things for which permission was not granted even if they perfectly
    meet fair use criteria."

    protection is 75 years from date of publication, assuming all renewals were filed
    in a timely fashion. \r\n\r\nSo, for the 1934 ATF specimen, if you wait a couple
    more months to publish your comparison, you're home free.  Fair use or not. ;-)\r\n\r\n--

  body: "I am not an expert of US copyright law, but I know from German copyright
    law that copyright period calculations are often tricky. As regards the calculations
    by Mr. Kentlaw concerning pre-1978-US-works it seems to me that his calculations
    are not correct.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    calculations start on the 1st of January of the following year, so that the work
    (given that Mr. Kentlaw's assumptions are correct) would fall into public domain
    on the 1st of January, 2010.\r\n"

  body: "Ah yes, right. I believe it was the so-called \"Mickey Mouse\" statute of
    1998 that extended the second term by another 20 years. The copyright reference
    that I generally use is from 1997, so I'd forgotten about that.\r\n\r\nJames,
    I guess you've got to wait another 20 years before you're in the clear (thanks
    to Sonny Bono). Assuming that ATF renewed the copyright in 1962, that is.\r\n\r\nAll
    of this sidesteps the question of whether what's being proposed is fair use. Which
    it very well might be. But I am not a lawyer and would not presume to advise in
    this regard. \r\n\r\n-- K."

    second, that even if someone does own the copyrights to the ATF specimen books,
    it\u2019s probably been forgotten and the paperwork is in a warehouse that would
    cost more to dig through than anyone could sue me for. "

    You should be able to locate him through Directory Assistance.\r\n\r\nGood luck

  body: "The copyright on the 1934 work is long expired and cannot be renewed.\r\n\r\nWhen
    ATF was auctioned off, the name and all rights associated with it went up for
    bid. Despite all the tear shedding one reads about this auction, it is my understanding
    that NO ONE bid on the rights. Kingsley's digital font realm dissolved some time
    before the auction of the physical plant itself. There may be trademark rights
    etc still valid for licensing purposes but you are free and clear to reproduce
    whatever you want from the 1934 specimen catalog. My god, the BB&S catalog is
    completely digitized and available on ebay for $25.\r\n\r\nGerald"
