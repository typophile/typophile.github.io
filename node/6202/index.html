<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Some observations of Macworld SF, 2003. <br> <br><b>Safari.</b> <br>All the rumor sites were calling this iBrowse. What, as <br>in, eyebrows? <br> <br>I was skeptical about Apple's latest foray--I thought the <br>browser war was over and IE won the oversized belt <br>buckle--until I tried it. It's pretty sweet. That is, for a beta. <br>If it proves to be as standards compliant as they say, <br>hopefully browser compatibility won't be as big of an <br>issue as I'm inclined to think. <br> <br>The speed looks promising, but leave it to Apple to <br>innovate with the interface. The thing sorts bookmarks <br>as deftly as iTunes handles MP3s. The built in Google <br>search is a nice feature. One that I miss when I'm <br>surfing with IE now. The interface is much leener than <br>IE--the top of the browser window, including all the <br>buttons and address bar, is exactly half the height of <br>Explorer's. The address bar doubling as the progress <br>bar is genius. <a href=http://www.apple.com/safari target=_blank>http://www.apple.com/safari</a> <br> <br><b>Keynote.</b> <br>Nobody can kill PowerPoint, nobody. But Apple <br>provides a compelling reason to try. First off, if this <br>could not import or export Microsoft's PPT format I <br>wouldn't give it a second glance, but alas it does. The <br>anti-aliased text, made possible by OS Xs quartz <br>engine, and ability to dump to Quicktime and PPT as I <br>said, make this an app I'd be willing to try. And anything <br>beats Microsoft's kludgy, counter-intuitive application <br>design (have you ever tried to use a master page in <br>PowerPoint? Ick.) <br> <br>I still think Adobe could one-up this sucker by creating <br>an add-on for InDesign. Imagine creating presentations <br>in an app as familiar as InDesign... Oh well. <br><a href=http://www.apple.com/safari target=_blank>http://www.apple.com/safari</a> <br> <br><b>17 inch PowerBook</b> <br>Does anyone have a need for this stealth-bomber of <br>laptops? There's no way this will replace a high quality, <br>true color monitor on my desk. If they're trying to appeal <br>to designers and creative types, why not lower the price <br>of their delectable 22" flat panel cinema displays. <br> <br>Then again, I may want one of these when I grow into <br>my size 14 shoes. <br><a href=http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html target=_blank>http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html</a> <br> <br><b>12 inch PowerBook</b> <br>Now we're talking. Not that I would ever want one of <br>these either, but if I were traveling Europe for a summer <br>with nothing but a backpack and a rail pass I surely <br>would. <br> <br>Too bad Apple already exhausted their 'road warrior' <br>campaign on their iPurse (ahem, the old candy colored <br>iBooks of 1999). <br><a href=http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html target=_blank>http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html</a> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I should've mentioned that Apple is pioneering yet <br>again with the announcement of Airport Extreme using <br>802.11g wireless protocol (fully five times faster than <br>current wireless standard) and of their new, doubly fast <br>FireWire. You'll recall Apple pioneered both USB and <br>the original FireWire. (Ahem, Go Apple!)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I said earlier: <br>> If they're trying to appeal to designers and creative <br>> types, why not lower the price of their delectable 22" <br>> flat panel cinema displays. <br> <br>The 20" flat panel has dropped from $3,999 to $1,299 <br>(both are Apple's MSRP). <br> <br>I'm not in the business of predicting the future, but <br>maybe I should be.</div>

<div class=commentbody>What's the native resolution on the Apple 22-inch screens? The impression I get is that although the screen is big, so are the pixels, so all you really gain is some area on the width. <br> <br>I'm watching the price on <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=-840&langId=-1&partNumber=9503DG3&storeId=1">these 3840x2400 babies</a>. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The 23-inch is 1920 x 1200 and the 22-inch is 1600 x 1024. The 22-inch model has a dpi of about 87. That's the model I have and I must say it's the best display of any kind I have ever had the pleasure to use. I try not to think too much about how much I paid for it two years ago, given what they're going for now. </div>
