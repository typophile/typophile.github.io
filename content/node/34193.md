  as font which this typical Embbeded Open Type from Ms. \r\n\r\nWe have 2 fonts which
  is STANDARD 07_53 and STANDARD 07_55. Now my question how do I use this font in
  PHOTOSHOP? Cause I need to change the the graphics that I believe it's using this
  font. If I can't get this to Photoshop ... I guess the clossed one that I thinks
  is FFF Harmony ... correct? \r\n\r\nThanks"

    need the real fonts to do work in Photoshop. If you don't have them (maybe they
    went with the other chap?) you can re-license them from here\u2026 http://miniml.com/fonts/index.htm"
