  But it's the first time in a long time that I've consciously given thought to it.
  I'm presented with a book that gives me the opportunity to play off the \"oldness\"
  of its subjects with the contemporary nature of its presentation: photos, computer
  typesetting, an ages-old issue discussed anew.\r\n\r\nSo, without asking for specific
  recommendations--<em>I'm not</em>--what about the avenues I might use to demonstrate
  this. For instance, there's the page size and dimension:  <em>the</em> classic proportion:
  the golden pean, for the text area. But a big square page which lots of negative
  space, as is modern day preference. Old types and new types is obvious, I guess.\r\n\r\nAnd
  also, possibly, the reversal of display and body text type--sans for text and serif
  for display. Now, about the latter: I am acutely aware--I rail about it often-how
  sans type for long stretches of body text is irritating to the eye and done to death
  these days. Still, I'm considering it.\r\n\r\nWhat other areas of the page design
  offer the opportunity for this kind of contrast?"

  body: Although you say square pages with much negative space are contemporary, I
    also see a variety of page sizes with smaller margins and a great deal of modularity.
    By saying juxtapose I think contrast rather than complement. Not knowing the subject
    I would consider approaching it by including a classic golden page within a larger
    page, and look to type that conflates and or updates features associated with
    the period you are considering. Maybe keep the type rigidly authentic, and let
    the page geometry unfold in a way that has a wink.

    sans serifs aren't as legible as serifs is based on nothing. Especially with the
    evolvement of the concept sans serif typeface. There are tons of very legible
    sans serifs specifically designed for longer stretches of body text. Like FF Milo
    and FF Kievit, to name two from the top of my head. I've set whole books with
    those, and it works fine.\r\n\r\nAnd then theres always the typefaces that sit
    somewhere in between, like the excellent [[http://www.farhill.nl/01_typefaces/versa.html}|Versa]]
    (used very succesfully in the book Dutch Type, for example. Which is a book with
    quite hefty pieces of text).\r\n\r\nI wouldn't let myself be restrained by such
    conventions, as long as you use a typeface that is designed for text."

    at <cite>Art of the Printed Book</cite> should show the reasons I think this .
    . .\r\n\r\nOr maybe you mean post-2000 as \"the new,\" which would leave me out
    of it. I think of Richard Eckersley as \"new\" & \"modern,\" but he liked a longer,
    skinny page, while still preserving somewhat classical margins. Still, I suppose
    he's a 1990s designer.\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI will say that there are a few sans fonts
    that hold up for text even to my old-fashioned eyes. One is TheSans, which oddly
    enough pairs nicely with TheSerif, unlike many of the other serif/sans pairs (Quadraat
    & Scala to mention two where either the sans or the serif is quite nice, but somehow
    don't pair all that well).\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: Ah, I forgot those. Quadraat Sans works really well for longer stretches of
    text. Scala Sans as well, but in my opinion to a lesser extent.
