body: I remember 20 years ago working with HP, they had lot of problems associated
  with the fact that they offered a couple dozen different printers. Twelve or so
  years ago, I remember how confused Apple's product line was. Time killed HPs variety
  and Jobs streamlined the Apple line to great effect. You'd think tech cos. would
  learn from this? But, I just read this weirdly deja vuesque piece on one of the
  phone companies yesterday. This phone company bigwig, I think his name was Dummer,
  or something like that, was bragging that his company would be offering 25 new phones
  this year! This year!? Am I missing something? Is there a bonus offered for each
  model running android?
