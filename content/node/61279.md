    if not sensationalistically, than airplane manuals) is the typography of medicine
    bottles/boxes, as practiced by Karel van der Waarde among others. Along with Karel
    one other person I remember chimed in at the second Thessaloniki conference claiming
    to save lives with typography: Richard Southall (and I have no reason to doubt

    convention.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt depends on whether you are creating an international
    name index or one targeted at a Dutch audience (it's a Dutch name).\r\n\r\nInternationally,
    it would be the \"v\" of \"Van der Waarde, Karel\". I think it's safe to say that
    'international' stands for 'not using the Dutch system'!\r\n\r\nThe Dutch system
    is to ignore lowercase prefixes: so, under \"W\" -- but still with the prefixes,
    so the full entry would be \"van der Waarde, Karel\". (Me, I'm listed under \"J\",
    and perfectly happy with that.)\r\n\r\nPrefixes in Holland are sorted normally,
    so in a block of \"[xx] Waarde\"'s \"aan de Waarde\" comes first, then \"de Waarde\",
    then \"van den Waarde\" and finally \"van der Waarde\". Another convention is
    to put the prefixes after initials, and in that case sorting is either on initials
    themselves, or (rather arbitrary) by street name or something like that:\r\n\r\nWaarde,
    A van\r\nWaarde, B de\r\nWaarde, C van der\r\n\r\nAs I'm writing this it sounds
    increasingly confusing; nevertheless, we usually can find the one we were looking
    for.\r\n\r\n[Edit] I might as well add I am as confused about quadruple Spanish
    names and the eternal conundrum \"Sung Song Blu Nigel\" [*] -- Sung Song Blu,
    with the taken 'Western' name \"Nigel\", but with last name sorting, is it Sung
    Song Blu, Blue Sung Song, or Sung Blu Song?\r\n\r\n[*] Somehow these guys/gals
    never call themselves \"John\" or \"Jack\", it's always something take right out
    of Jane Austen."
