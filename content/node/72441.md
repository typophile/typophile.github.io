  body: I've seen those threads before, I just wanted to confirm whether or not this
    was an existing typeface? By the looks of it it might be a custom tweak of an
    existing fat didone.

  body: I highly doubt this is available as digital font. It might be custom lettering,
    or a modified Pistilli Roman, or an obscure pre-digital  typeface similar to Pistilli
    Roman.
