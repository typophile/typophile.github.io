  body: I don&#39;t know how anyone would count this. I suppose you could <a href="http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/commercialfonts.html">start
    here</a>... but unfortunately that is just a starting place. I&#39;m curious about
    whatever conclusion you reach.

  body: My fonts has 35,000 available on their site, Font Shop has a big number as
    well. Do you want to know how many individual fonts are availabe or how many font
    families there are? <BR> <BR>If you want some bibliographic reference, Rober Bringhurt
    estimates in 50,000 the amount of digital fonts and in 6,000 the amount of families
    in &#34;The elements of typographic style&#34;.

  body: i&#39;m just looking for a number of families. i know that linotype has an
    current print advert saying they offer 6000 fonts. don&#39;t know if they talk
    about families, i guess not. <BR> <BR>hector, you have the referencing page number
    in elements of typographic style? <BR> <BR>6000 families sounds &#34;ok&#34; to
    me, just have to count the new release since the release of bringhurst&#39;s book

  body: 'I must correct Si, at least as far as MyFonts is concerned. We have always
    measured our main &#34;font count&#34; in terms of Styles &#40;aka Weights&#41;,
    not Versions. <BR> <BR>Multiple versions in OT, PS, TT available for the Mac and
    Windows platforms count as Versions, not Styles. We also collapse various linguistic
    codepages &#40;e.g. Cyrillic, Greek, CE, Turkish Helvetica&#41; into the same
    Style. <BR> <BR>Current count of fonts live at MyFonts: <BR> <BR>&#42; 11,440
    families <BR>&#42; 39,231 styles <BR>&#42; 182,730 versions <BR> <BR>We also hold
    onto old versions and versions deactivated for other reasons, just in case customers
    need access to fonts no longer on sale. These are normally available from one&#39;s
    &#34;My Account&#34; download area.'

  body: ??? The styles number is <i>larger</i> than the families number. I think you
    must have read it wrong. <BR> <BR>Family = Helvetica, Times, etc. <BR>Style =
    Roman, Italic, Bold, etc. <BR> <BR>According to the MyFonts numbers, this averages
    out to a little less than four styles per family, which sounds about right.
