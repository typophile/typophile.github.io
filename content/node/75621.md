  that I keep in a folder (my \"best\").\r\nI have imported this folder in a set in
  Font Explorer.\r\nI have created an illustrator file containing a line for every
  different typeface, one after the other. I can use the function \"find&replace\"
  to change all the dummy text to my desired logo word.\r\n\r\nHow do you do that?
  Do you use something online like myfonts? Maybe you use your font manager and then
  you just activate the ones that might work?\r\n\r\nThe trick is to create a system
  that is fast, does note engulf the computer, and is portable (think about a freelancer
  who is often offsite, working in an agency).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nP\r\n"

  body: 'That sounds like a shotgun approach. While perhaps appropriate at times,
    it''s usually easier to go into a project with a sense of what you need for typefaces
    so you''ve narrowed down the selection tremendously before you even click on the
    font menu. '
