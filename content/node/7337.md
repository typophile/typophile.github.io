    been well-received all over the typography web, it seems. <BR> <BR>It still has
    some incomplete sections, but it is rapidly approaching the suggested maximum
    length of Wikipedia articles. I plan to complete the remaining bits and apply
    to have it featured on Wikipedia&#39;s first page &#40;nominate it to become a
    so-called &#34;featured article&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>It has really awakened my
    interest in typography. I&#39;m by no means an expert, but I&#39;ve made sure
    all my claims are carefully supported in the references section. Naturally any
    professional input that you people can add is _greatly_ appreciated. Also, consider
    helping me identify the font used in Apple&#39;s forgotten and ancient logo on
    the font identification board: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52251.html?1098964709"

  body: David, great effort. <BR>The one -unfortunate- thing you might consider adding
    in there is Apple&#39;s precipitous fall of late, in terms of the dubious pedigree
    of its recent mass-offerings of fonts; not to mention things like the ethical
    shakiness of the Chalkboard&#42; typeface. Seeing how well the ambivalence towards
    ITC Garamond has been handled in the article, I&#39;m very hopeful for a balanced
    -but candid- text. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20611.html"

  body: 'Hrant: Interesting. <BR> <BR>I am working on compiling a complete list of
    the typfecase included with Mac OS X. So far, I&#39;ve investigated 10.0, 10.1
    and 10.2. I&#39;ve still got Panther to go. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s curious, is that
    I haven&#39;t bumped into &#34;Chalkboard&#34; yet. Comic Sans MS, however, is
    still included. <BR> <BR>I remember when I beta-tested Panther, that the MS web
    fonts were not installed when once chose to disable Internet Explorer in the installation.
    Perhaps they included Chalkboard instead, then...If it&#39;s there, I&#39;ll find
    it... <BR> <BR>What do you mean by &#34;mass-offerings&#34; of fonts, by the way?
    I think most of the fonts included with OS X are of exceptionally high quality,
    and licensed from respected vendors such as Zapfino and Optima from Linotype.
    And Apple&#39;s own AAT fonts, such as Apple Chancery are pretty nice too, aren&#39;t
    they? <BR> <BR>Speaking of Comic Sans MS...Apple Casual is sort of similar in
    its style. What is your opinion on that typeface? &#40;Sample below, and in the
    article&#41;. It is only used by Inkwell. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52272.png"

    <BR> <BR>Those huge bundles of fonts created by third-parties, I presume, but
    sold through Apple. Although dumping the MS core fonts and replacing them with
    inferior copies is probably worse. <BR> <BR>AppleCasual versus ComicSans versus
    Chalkboard: <BR>To me the latter two look much closer to each other than either
    to the first - if that makes sense.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp'
