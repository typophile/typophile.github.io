  body: "My guess is that this is hand-drawn calligraphy, and it's hard to prove because
    no letters repeat. It seems like a pseudo-blackletter style, made to be more legible
    and simpler to draw.\r\n\r\nSome roughly similar fonts: Blackball, Christmas and
    Caligra, all at MyFonts.com.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
