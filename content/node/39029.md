  plan on selling the font (it\u2019s really just for my own use), but I\u2019m acting
  as if I will, because I want the experience of creating a polished font that would
  meet the requirements of a commercially viable font.\r\n\r\nWhich codepages does
  everyone think the average, commercially useful font should support? I\u2019m using
  Fontlab on Windows, and have so far completed the MS Windows 1252 Western codepage.
  I\u2019ve also included additional characters, such as L slash, the fi and fl ligatures,
  and a few additional diacritical marks.\r\n\r\nSo far, I\u2019ve been basically
  shooting for the union of the Windows 1252 and MacOS Roman code pages. Am I leaving
  anything out this way? I notice that neither codepage includes additional ligatures
  like ffi and ffl. Is there a more standard list of \u201Cusually supported\u201D
  codepages among the major fonts out there?\r\n\r\nBefore I move on to metrics and
  the final round of details, I want to finalize my codepage support and wrap up all
  the remaining glyphs.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "You don't say what kind of design it is, which might make a difference.\r\n\r\nThere's
    sort of an escalating scale of bigger and bigger character sets one can consider,
    for language coverage. Semi-independently are some questions of typographic coverage.\r\n\r\nAt
    Adobe, our most basic character set is essentially the union of MacRoman and WinANSI
    (codepage 1252), plus litre and estimated.\r\n\r\nSome typographic things one
    might consider as \"relatively\" standard, depending on the design:\r\n\r\n- having
    all five f-ligatures (fi fl ff ffi ffl)\r\n- more fractions, or a full set of
    numeric numerators/denominators/superiors/inferiors\r\n- small caps\r\n\r\nFor
    the next step in language coverage, we do \"Adobe CE\" which includes Windows
    Eastern European, Baltic and Turkish codepages.\r\n\r\nSee also http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/info/charsets.html\r\n\r\nIt
    keeps on escalating after that, but you probably don't want to have 3000 glyphs
    per font.  :/\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "Great, you pretty much confirmed my assumptions. I was actually just having
    a look at my ligures when I read this and was going to make a list of which ones
    to include-- I've already got the fi and fl, and will add ff, ffi and ffl.\r\n\r\nI
    also think the small caps/additional numerator/denominators is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBTW
    - I've always felt that since the MacOS/WinANSI union already flirts with greek
    letters so much, an entire majiscule/miniscule greek alphabet should be pretty
    standard these days in the average font. So many greek letters have so many current
    uses, especially when it comes to mathematics, programming and engineering, that
    you might as well go the extra step and round out the alphabet. I might come back
    for a round 2 with this font of mine and do that.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
