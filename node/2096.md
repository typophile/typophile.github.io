  working - sorry! <BR> <BR>The 3G operator <a href="http://www.three.co.uk" target="_blank">www.three.co.uk</a>
  uses two fonts, one serifed and one sans. <BR> <BR>Are these public fonts or custom
  made for Hutchinson Three?

  body: I looked at Yves link there &#40;I must have missed that thread originally&#41;
    and the post says I had &#34;Modena&#34; on my site, but that font was actually
    <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg15.html" target="_blank">&#34;ModenA&#34;</a>
    by  Zhivko Stankulov of Fonteam International. Miles Newlyn personally had supplied
    about 4 or 5 samples for the Script Guide  &#40;Ferox, Bugini &amp; Luvbug with
    variations&#41;, but Modena wasn&#39;t one of them.

  body: Oops! I DID have Modena, but it was in the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg15.html"
    target="_blank">Sans ID Guide</a> &#40;at the bottom of the page&#41;. The sample
    he gave me of this must have used a different version of the &#39;y&#39;, because
    what I show doesn&#39;t match that letter in the other post of Modena that Yves
    linked.

  body: Just a follow-up. Coincidentally, I heard from Miles Newlyn with an ID question
    yesterday and mentioned to him about this thread. He wrote this morning and said
    the font is Modena Condensed &#40;no &#39;r&#39; in the font name&#41; and that
    it was &#39;a custom redraw with some very odd characteristics &#40;ie the huge
    x height, and the unique y&#41;&#39;. <BR> <BR>He also said that Modena &#40;pure&#41;
    will be available next year.
