  body: "The error message is self-explanatory. In the features block the Opentype
    features are defined, and of course they refer to the characters that are going
    to be used. For that it does not need the \"character code\", but its glyph index
    instead (this is so you can have different glyphs that all represent the character
    'b', for example; as well as glyphs that do not have a regular character code,
    such as a non-standard ligature).\r\nSo what the error message means is that one
    of the features refers to a \"glyph b\", which is not in your font, or so it appears.\r\n\r\nNote
    that this error also may have happened because five errors earlier creating the
    font file itself failed."
