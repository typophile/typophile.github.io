    transparency mode of block from normal to "multiply".

  body: "Illustrator, yes!\r\n\r\nWhat exactly you want to do with your image? If
    you want it to be monotonous(tints and shades of one color), thats the only way
    in Illustrator. Since its not an image editing software, you cant play much with
    images directly. "

  body: "There is another way, but it may not have quite the result you're looking
    for and involves Photoshop too:  Basically convert your colour image to Grayscale
    (Image>Mode>Grayscale), then convert it to a Bitmap image (Image>Mode>Bitmap -
    set the output resolution at at least 300dpi).  You then end up with a 1bit image:
    \ Take this into Illustrator and select the desired colour and drop it onto the
    image.  You then have something akin to what you're looking for.  The shame is
    that in Macromedia Freehand (RIP), you could drop a grayscale image (not a bitmap)
    into it and colourise it the same way much like Quark does/did, and it would be
    great.  I'll never understand why Illustrator doesn't do this - especially now
    that Adobe bought up Macromedia!\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\nJH "

  body: "If you are using Photoshop you can also add an adjustment layer (on the bottom
    of the layers pallet, click the black & white circle) then choose gradient map.
    Then choose white and your colour, you can then choose the amount of white verses
    colour by sliding the stoppers.\r\n\r\nThis technique is more useful for when
    you want to use more then two colours. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso very useful for changing
    the colour of an object that is already full colour, say you have a red truck
    and you want to make it green. First use another adjustment layer to greyscale
    the section that you want to change (use a mask on the adjustment layer to isolate
    the section you want to change), then use the gradient map layer to have; black,
    your new colour say green, then white. Again use the mask to isolate the section
    you want, and try sliding the stoppers until you get a desirable outcome.\r\n\r\nSorry
    to digress.\r\n\r\nGood luck"

    Thats what I was talking about.  Forgot the program name.\r\n\r\nSeems like such
    a simple thing.  ADOBE STEP UP YOUR GAME."

    a rectangle with color behind the image, select both image and rectangle and choose
    Make Opacity Mask in Transparency palette menu.\r\n\r\nTo correct for the negative
    image, show thumbnails in same menu and check invert Mask.\r\n\r\nUse the bars
    in the color palette for the color you want."
