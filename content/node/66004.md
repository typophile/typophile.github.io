body: We've recently developed a font for one of our clients and we're looking for
  someone to put this into a (keyboard) usable format for them. Is there anyone who
  could help with this (we're based in South Africa, so we'd need to do this remotely).

  body: Hi Susie. Do you have vector drawings of the letters, or just plain paper
    sketches? It's a quite a bit more to it than just programming to turn drawings
    into a working font. You need to consider spacing, kerning, how well the letters
    work together and many other variables. Feel free to contact me offline! (Follow
    the link on my profile.)
