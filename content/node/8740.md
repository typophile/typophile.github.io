  body: I like the top/left direction, but it would benefit if you could refine the
    weight distribution to make it look like its own letterform. Right now it&#39;s
    obviously very heavy on the right. You might try lightening the right side, adding
    a little weight to the left side and adjusting the horizontals accordingly. <BR>

  body: First, to help me to critic properly thoses sketches, it would have been essential
    to know in which sector you work. <BR> <BR>But , I could try to give you some
    basic critic.There are lots of good idea here. At my opinion, the first DB would
    be the one to have more chance to go somewhere, depend of course of your activity
    sector.  The second, the third and the fifth remind me a bowling bowl. I suggest
    to work on the middle terminal of the B &#40;center join&#41;, seems to sharp.
    Also, you could rotate the D to the right or to the left to get something like
    a diamond or lozenge. Thoses one with a drop shadow could give you a hard time
    to keep the white hairline clear at small size. <BR> <BR>Andr

  body: Usually a logo will symbolizes or represents something about the given company
    for which it stands for. I am just wondering what the logo you have designed stands
    for. If it is purely for looks than I can&#39;t help you. If there is meaning
    behind it, than it will be  easier to critique. In my personal opinion the better
    logos out there reflect something about the personality and meaning behind the
    particular company for which they stand for. <BR>Anyway, only an opinion.

    logos, i mean &#39;ordinary&#39; people, &#39;little men&#39;, people who are
    not designers, see anything in a logo? <BR>  <BR>from my experience, i think they
    don&#39;t, they just get a certain &#39;feel&#39; or a &#39;vibe&#39; from a logo,
    but i don&#39;t think it goes deeper that that for them . . . correct me if i&#39;m
    wrong. <BR>  <BR>as for designers, i think it&#39;s obvious taht they do look

  body: I feel that one of our jobs as designers is to visually educate people with
    meaningful thoughtful sensitive design. One way to NOT do this is to remove the
    meaning all together. If there is no meaning you aren&#39;t educating anyone.
    <BR> <BR>For me it makes it difficult on the viewer to try to figure out why you
    combined the letterforms. Especially if there is no reason.

  body: Wow! We&#39;re starting to get really philosophical over this. <BR> <BR>To
    David&#39;s point, an entity&#39;s logo should be purposeful. It should represent
    the entity that it is being designed for. <BR> <BR>In Dragan&#39;s defense, this
    logo&#39;s purpose is to represent his design business, possibly, but not necessarily,  in
    a way that reflects his design style; hence, it is successful in that it is his
    initials &#40;representing his business just as well as any business that is represented
    by names or initials&#41; and it is designed by him &#40;must show his style&#41;.
    I think his concept is solid, so it is his execution that will determine whether
    or not this is a successful logo in the end. <BR> <BR>Your concept in post 6 looks
    like a bed&#39;s footboard on its side. Of the concepts in the last post &#40;7&#41;,
    I like the direction on the bottom, but now &#40;your going to kill me for this&#41;
    it&#39;s a little too subtle. Rather than reading a &#34;B&#34;, I&#39;m seeing
    a big pimple or mosquito bite. Try bringing back a little more of the stroke in
    that area so that the bump isn&#39;t so abrupt. Also, the terminal is a little
    too rounded. I think there&#39;s a good shape in there, it&#39;s just hiding in
    between a couple of your executions. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: A logo doesn&#39;t need to have any inherent meaning. It&#39;s simply a flag
    the company can wave. What&#39;s more important is consistency of use, how memorable
    the mark is, uniqueness in the market, &#39;vibe&#39;, etc. <BR> <BR>In fact,
    many logos fail because they try to posses too much lieteral meaning in them.
    <BR> <BR>IMHO, of course. <BR> <BR>Actually, I typed this before reading Scott&#39;s

    <BR>i thought too the curve is too &#39;mellow&#39; now. <BR>as this conversation
    is going, i was thinking about it and i came to a conclusion that a logo really
    doesn&#39;t have to represent anything at all, but even in that case it WILL represent
    something - NOTHING&#40;if that is your attitude&#41;, if you can understand what
    i&#39;m saying . . . <BR>well what i am trying to say here doesn&#39;t neccessarilly
    has to reflect this design in particular, i am talking on the subject of the logo
    being the true symbol that will represent the core of the company or an individual.
    <BR>so, it can be taken for a l&#39;art pour l&#39;art kind of thing, you know

    it is something to think about. :-&#41; <BR>  <BR>tomorrow i&#39;ll redo some

    in a million different ways.  Which way is the right way? <BR>I ask myself  simple
    question about the logos presented here.  <BR> <BR>How do these logos visually
    represent that you are a graphic designer? <BR> <BR>To Darrel; <BR>Don&#39;t you
    think a logo is more memorable if it has some underlying metaphor or meaning in
    it? I&#39;m not talking about a literal meaning like you mentioned. I am talking
    more simplified, timeless and abstract. <BR> <BR>Here comes my sobering point
    of the day. <BR>Graphic design firms with logos are limiting themselves. Why would
    you design a logo for a logo designing company? This might be to heady to talk
    about on this forum. Look at the logos of some the greatest design firms in the
    world. You will find that there is nothing tricky or contrived or forced about
    any of them. In fact, they have a certain consistency about them for a simple
    reason. They do to many different tasks as design firms to try and represent themselves
    with a single mark. Most of there logos are more like logotypes that just read
    simply and smoothly , no bells and whistles man. <BR>  <BR>Again...only my opinion.
