  read but I am having some trouble finding a couple of the faces that he mentions.\r\n\r\non
  page 133 of the book the typefaces 'Kristal' and 'Vogue' are mentioned in a roundup
  of faces 'paying homage to Futura'\r\nMy google skills may be lacking but I thought
  I would throw it out there.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nBest."

    1937. It was sold by other metal foundries under the names Polar, Rund Grotesk,
    Saxo and Predilecta, as well as others (source: Jaspert). There may be digital
    incarnations under any of those names.'
