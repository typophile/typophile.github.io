  body: Oh. Sorry. I thought you were looking for one that fits all three. Hmm. I
    guess I need to think a bit more. Electra does fit all three though. Dwiggins
    was ahead of his time, he had tons of passion (enough to drive CH Griffith nuts),
    and is a legend.

  body: "How and where are the words going to be displayed? In isolation, or in text?
    Separately, or close to each other? At what sizes? In print or on screen? At what
    resolutions? In what colours? Will the words be reversed out of a darker background?\r\n\r\nFor
    individual words, the best solution may well be custom lettering. Typefaces exist
    to make it easy to compose large quantities of text. If you only have three words
    to worry about, you can make something much more interesting and tailored to both
    content and circumstance by creating custom lettering."

    a small brainstorming session for a friend of mines work. He used to be a typographer/designer
    and has now crossed into the photography realm. However he can not quite let go
    of his former love so he decided to combine them and has started making a series
    of typographic handmade hi res images. I've included one for reference here. More
    to come as we go;-) This is where art meets type, where the meaning is not necesarily
