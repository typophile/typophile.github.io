  body: "I like your take. \r\nThree notes:\r\n1. Capital S is a little weak next
    to the other letters.\r\n2. Original one still has a better rhythm to it.\r\n3.
    Your logo could be seen as more (or not enough) of a departure from the old one
    than the client could be confortable with."

    on how to make the s stronger and improve the flow of the logo as a whole?"

  body: "I agree with the capital s.\r\n\r\nI don't agree with riccard0 about the
    rhythm. I think your piece conveys a kind of calmness that I suspect is suitable
    for the client.\r\n\r\nGreat job!"

  body: One problem I see about the S is that the thin lines appear thinner than the
    ones of the lowercase.
