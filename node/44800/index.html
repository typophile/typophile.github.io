  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I&rsquo;m a young designer hired on by an IT staffing company to do there marketing and design in-house. I&rsquo;m working in the corporate environment for the first time and am getting accustomed to meshing High Design and Corporate Ideals. I&rsquo;m working on a logo for a website that is being launched and need some guidance. Here’s what we’ve come up with.</p>
<p><a href="http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q275/sthartl/erplogo.jpg">http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q275/sthartl/erplogo.jpg</a></p>
<p>Here are my challenges:
The colors are set
The hexagon shape is required
The web address (with the hyphen) was to easily discernable, i.e. there has to be continuity throughout &lsquo;erp-consulting&rsquo;
Needs to maintain high-end corporate look
The general council is comprised of non-creative so anything over stylized doesn&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>In general what&rsquo;s a good way to manage lots of type in a logo?
Any advice on doing creative work in non-creative environments? How do I stay inspired and how so I integrate design into the corporate mindset</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe they use erp for a name. <em>hic</em></p>
<p>Your kerning needs some work. It looks now like you were running out of room at the end.
I think it looks much better than their current stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any advice on doing creative work in non-creative environments?&rdquo;
Keep pushing design on them but remember to back it up with how it&rsquo;s going to improve their business and improve their ROI. I&rsquo;ve learned that working in a non-creative environment requires a different strategy on how to present/sell a concept. What will not work is describing how &lsquo;pretty&rsquo; a color is or how the idea came to you in a dream. Metaphors don&rsquo;t really cut it in this environment. What does work is a mix of creative and business lingo. Their about numbers. You&rsquo;re about creativity. Find the happy medium and you&rsquo;ll have success. Just keeping pushing design on them. They too want to see what you see. They&rsquo;re just afraid of making a decision that could ultimately decrease their revenue/stock/professionalism. Gaining their trust take time and patience. So hang in there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tre, since you are stuck with the cube and colors, why not establish the identity through the type? I feel now it ALL looks a little tired and generic, whereas if you take the cube as a starting point and work on typographic treatments that mirror the curves and angles I feel you will get something a little more memorable.</p>
<p>Sharon is correct about the kerning at the end. Way too tight visually compared with the start.</p>
<p>Also - what would the .com look like at small sizes. The weight seems so thin I imagine you may have issues.</p>
<p>Work out a black and white version too.</p>
