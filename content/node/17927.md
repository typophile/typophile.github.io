  body: "I think it is the weight of the P icon which is working against Proxima's
    favour. I was wondering if it was worth extending the stem of the P to make the
    classic Polaroid photograph with the larger margin at the bottom of the frame.\r\nTim"

    body: "Not entirely sure that it is the weight of the P icon. I would say that
      the \"a\" and the \"d\" of Avant Garde possess less contrast which helps them
      work with the icon. Second, the four counters in the Avant Garde (o,a,o,d) have
      the optical effect of mimicking part of the angular P structure. Proxima Nova
      is effectively rather beautiful, but seems to me to be thrown by the proximity
      of such a geometric form. Am inclined to agree with Miss Tiffany.\r\n\r\nmc"

  body: "<em>I think it would be too obvious and almost cheesy</em>\r\nYes, you are
    probably right, I guessed that the positioning of the type was to create that
    effect. But of all the photography/film formats that shape is the most recognisable
    and individual (I know that Polaroid film is made in many formats, I'm thinking
    of the general public's connection with Polaroid), if you wanted to make a non-type
    logo <em>obvious</em> wouldn't be a bad place to start.\r\nToo sporty\r\nI suppose
    you are thinking of Adidas although <a href=\"http://logotypes.designer.am/srch/search.php?pg=3&r=t&a=u\">Umbro</a>
    might also be a concern.\r\nTim"
