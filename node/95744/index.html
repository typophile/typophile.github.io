  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Typophiles,</p>
<p>In September I have to typeset a big report (about 120,000 words). It&rsquo;s one I wrote incidentally, and the subject is post-war school buildings in England. c.100 copies will be digitally printed, but most people will read the doc in pdf format as it will be available online.</p>
<p>The documents has to comply with the house style and the report series format of my organisation (info below), which severely limits my options. But I want to do everything I can, within these limits, to ease the typographical pain!  So any suggestions welcome, particularly in relation to:</p>
<p>1.Point size/leading.  I wondered what people point size /leading people would recommend for extended text in Gill Sans Light on a text block which is about 150x230mm. 11/13 seems to give around 16 words/line &ndash;is this ok?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Each chapter consists of a main text, followed by a gazetteer which describes a series of case studies. I would expect most readers to read the main text but only &lsquo;dip into&rsquo; the gazetteer. So I was thinking of putting the latter into two columns and small type, say 9/11. Any thoughts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My references will be in endnotes at the end of each chapter (again, part of the house style). I was thinking of putting them into 9 or 8 points in two columns. Is this going test Gill Light or my readers eyes?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Format: Soft-bound A4 report, double-sided. 
Margins: L&amp;R 30mm; top 35mm, bottom 45mm
Typeface: Gill sans light.</p>
<p>I will try out a few mockups tomorrow, and may post a few pdfs. Meanwhile, any advice welcome!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Geraint</p>

<ol>
<li>To go with the stipulated typeface (Gill Sans Light) but set it as carefully as I can for extended reading(open up the spacing as Andreas suggests, maybe slightly larger point size and/or more leading).</li>
<li>To make a case to break withthe house style and go for a face which performs better both on screen and in print. (Typographically of course this is preferable; logistically might not be easy, but that&rsquo;s my problem I suppose). Options might be Charter, which I think we use in other applications, or perhaps something like Constantia.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Gill Sans Light is not meant for body text. My suggestion is your second option, but keep GSL for illustration captions, and perhaps page numbers. The other weights of Gill Sans are still acceptable for headings, chapter titles, etc. As for the text, my first choice would be Gentium, which I have found to be a good pairing with Gill Sans headers. It is not excessively &ldquo;round&rdquo; (as Gill Sans is), and does not have very sharp serifs which would be a distraction in this case. Of the two you mentioned. Constantia also has those characteristics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like pairing food and wine.</p>

The spec here meets accessibility standards.
However, I don’t like the way the font in the pdf is spaced; too tight, too much kerning—this is especially an issue for screen reading.
Why is the spacing so ghastly? Is it the font or Adobe’s “Optical” kerning?
The typeface was not designed to be spaced this way.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I was acclimatized to it at an early age, it was the typeface used in my Meccano manuals.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Hrant, John and Nick for your sage comments. I must admit Nick that I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with reading Monotype 262. I can&rsquo;t remember whether the spacing and kerning were &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; or Indy&rsquo;d optical. I can remember making a character style for thickened fake small caps which looks predictably dreadful onscreen&ndash;(&amp; seem a big small on paper).</p>
<p>The main thing is that I don&rsquo;t really have a free hand. I believe our house style contains Carter&rsquo;s ITC Charter&ndash;I will find out tomorrow. Using Charter here&ndash;perhaps with the Gill for headings as mjr suggests&ndash;would bend not break the rules. I&rsquo;ve been asked to come up with some recommendations for revising this report format in the coming months, and would like to treat this report as a &lsquo;prototype&rsquo; format for extended reports that would be available to others. That therefore gives weight to using a face which is already &lsquo;in place&rsquo; and for which we possess a licence&ndash;ie. Charter. I don&rsquo;t know how well Charter stands up to onscreen use but should imagine such a sturdy face should be ok?</p>

<p>Yes indeed, and it&rsquo;s a size that fits well into standard file folders, which is an important consideration for business documents that need to be filed and saved. Also that size works well in standard pocket folders and 3-ring binders.</p>
<p>But generally I don&rsquo;t like to have one column span the width of letter-sized paper; 2 or 3 columns usually work better. Sometimes flipping the page to a horizontal (landscape) orientation and binding on the short edge is a nice way to make the letter-sized format look a little different.</p>

<p>According to the article, the origins were in the 1600&rsquo;s when it was a convenient size for Dutch paper maker. By the early 1900s there were 2 common sizes in the U.S. — 8.5 x 11 and 8.5 x 10.5.  It wasn&rsquo;t until the 1980&rsquo;s that the U.S. government declared 8.5 x 11 to be the standard size here for government printing.</p>

<p>That can be a good option, but for a multipage piece keep in mind that 1) it&rsquo;ll need to be saddle stitched (stapled on the fold) and 2) the pages need to be resequenced prior to printing. For example, on a 20-page saddle-stitched piece, page 4 and page 17 are printed side by side on the same sheet of paper, but appear in the correct sequence after it is bound and folded. A good print shop can take can care of this for you, but a small copy shop might require you to resequence the pages  yourself before printing.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using a real typography program, it will do this for you. And even in a word processing program, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to get this right just by making a blank mockup, numbering the pages, and then pulling it apart to see what pages end up next to each other. The next challenge is getting it to print right on a single-sided office printer. Even that just takes a bit of trial and error.</p>
<p>I have seen, and been responsible for, plenty of playbills etc that were typed up in Word, imposed manually, and printed one side at a time on a desktop printer. I think it&rsquo;s nearly always worth the effort.</p>
