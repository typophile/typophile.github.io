  body: "I just spent a fair amount of time searching Dafont, AbstractFonts and even
    MyFonts for the eroded font, which I thought it should be easy to find. I had
    no luck finding an exact match. I checked every category and keyword that I thought
    might apply.\r\n\r\nI didn't look for the Stowe script, because I felt it looked
    custom (hand-drawn). \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
