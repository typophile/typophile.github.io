body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a project for a supplier of upmarket dog kennels. The logotype
  has already been signed off, and is a slightly modified Trajan Pro effort.\r\n\r\nI
  am looking to use <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=13648\">FontFont
  Dax </a>as the body type for the brochure, mainly because it's one of the largest
  x height font's I have, and it offers the right level of formality without being
  impersonal - it also has a nice range of weights.\r\n\r\nTo impart a link to the
  more traditional feel of the company I am looking for a serif to use in titling.
  \r\n\r\nI have not been able to find something I'm happy with - but I might be suffering
  from \"wood and trees\" as I've been studying combinations for a few hours. I looked
  at Warnock, but I keep coming back to Garamond Premier...\r\n\r\nHas anyone found
  a good match with Dax body type in practice?\r\n\r\nThanks for any comments.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 2 days and no reply... sob sob... I'm sure I'm not breaking new ground with
    Dax as body type... surely someone has successfuly used a serif for headlines
    with it?

  body: "I've used Dax for body copy, and have been very pleased with it. I have not
    used, and I'm not sure I would use, a display serif to complement it. \r\n\r\nBut
    I've used both sans (Parisine Bold) and slabs (PMN Caecilia) to good effect\r\n\r\n"

    body: Thanks Ken.... it's maybe serendipity, but whilst enjoying some soup this
      lunchtime, I noticed the type on the white pepper was actually set in Dax, and
      the headline text was set in a slab or clarendon type face (rather small to
      see if the serifs were adnate or sheer slab)... its something I'll explore...
      I might initiat another thread to explore the factors that should leads to two
      fonts, particularly a serif/sans paring, working together.
