  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have noticed that lots of folks on the board have talked about the necessity of creating glyphs/characters which look a bit odd, eccentric, ugly or couterintuitivly shaped in order to get good flow in a text face in the course of discussing some other related topic. Has there been a thread that deals with this idea directly or in a more comprehensive manner?  <BR> <BR>examples: <BR> <BR>I was looking at Costa's (Porchez Typofonderie) bold/black 'a' &amp; thinking how right this idea must be. It's an ugly duckling for sure on it's own ( I think ) &amp; yet it works very well. No doubt about that. <BR> <BR>CostaPTF<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/69103.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/">http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/</a></a> <BR> <BR>Hrant has also talked about the need for a compressed looking 'g'  &amp; the need to take special care with the 'r'. ( the arm needs to be shorter than you might think no? ) <BR> <BR>Hrant said &quot; Your &quot;g&quot;s need help though. For the Roman, I'd suggest giving it a bigger head and cramping the bottom (natural in a text face)&quot;  <BR> <BR>Anybody have a favorite 'ugly' character?  <BR> <BR>Anybody have a list of characters that need of distortion in a text face?  And maybe a description of the ditortion recomended?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, I understand that all opinion about design is purely subjective, but I wonder if you and I are seeing Costa in the same light? <BR> <BR>I do agree with Hrant that some characters, on their own, are bound to be a little odd looking. I also agree that it is for the good of the &quot;group&quot; that this occurs. But, how often does it happen? I personally do see some typefaces where a character is ugly&ndash;my opinion&hellip;all subjective&ndash;but if the designer knows&ndash;perhaps I need to read the whole thread first&ndash;what they are doing there doesn't have to be a lot of this occurring.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't mean litterally 'ugly'. That was hyperbole - it's true. <BR> <BR>I should clarify that I mean the top bold 'a' specifically - not the italic form &amp; by ugly I don't mean disgusting or horrible but rather something odd or different from the other characters. Something suprising &amp; unprogramatic - maybe a little stinky even. An exception.  <BR> <BR>There are alot of examples of this kind of thing in other arts.  <BR> <BR>- In perfume you often need a stinky/musky smell to go with your pretty aromas in order to take attention ( musk )  &amp; then reward that attention ( flower, fruits, spice etc. ).  <BR> <BR>- In western musical theory you need some 'disonant' or 'sad' notes to go with your 'whole' or 'happy' notes to create a feeling of resolution - otherwise it just sounds a bit boring. <BR> <BR>- Vienamese food needs a bit of stinky fermented fish sauce (which taken straight would be terrible) - or it comes off as bland &amp; uncomplicated. The fish sauce provides interest. <BR> <BR>I am sure there are plenty of other examples &amp; probably better ones &amp; even the Coasta 'a' may not be the best example of this exception in type - but the point is that type in general benefits from careful use of exceptions &amp; this is perhaps most true in a text face. <BR> <BR>I want to try to focus in on characters that benefit from being  exceptional in some way &amp; maybe even a bit distorted or stinky for a text face. <BR> <BR>I was hoping to do this without getting into the whole legibility/readabilty/baouma (sp?) debate - or a sellability debate ( Spiekermann's often related comment ((now paraphrased poorly by me)) that type designs with unusual shaped letters often sell better).  <BR> <BR>Anyway - no offence meant. Just the opposite in fact.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Costa's letters are quite pretty, even the &quot;a&quot;.  <BR> <BR>But I understand what you're saying. I think Gill Sans' e and a are among the ugliest letters ever drawn. <BR> <BR>I suppose what's more important is how the shapes of the letters fit together to form readable word gestalts. That might require ugly letterforms from time to time.</div>
