  to rely on you at least one more time: <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone knew of
  some gallery sites showcasing final projects from students from all over the world?
  &#40;preferably BA honors but Masters degree is also OK&#41; <BR> <BR>If you are
  a graphic design student who recently did your final project or have one in the
  making, maybe you could drop me a line. <BR> <BR>All the best, <BR> <BR>Ragnar Freyr
