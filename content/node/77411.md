  body: Then I think Leking is definitely one of them. Any idea about other fonts?

  body: "Definitely not LeKing.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/misprinted/le-king/regular/\r\n\r\nAt
    least the E is the same font for both of them. Since LeKing looks like the glyphs
    are from different fonts, it's possible that TYPEFACE is one font. It has the
    look of a Eduardo Recife font, but not any that are the MyFonts site."
