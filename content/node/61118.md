body: "Hiya, I'm trying to identify this typeface from a website for a product.  The
  site is http://bayarearidersforum.com , a motorcycle discussion board in the SF
  Bay Area.  \r\n\r\nThe site's owner doesn't know what it is, or have any better
  samples.  I've tried whathefont, identifont and have been digging at linotype.com
  and font.com for hours, but with no luck.  (And now I'm feeling pretty dense ;)
  Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vBulletin_logo_6030.gif]"

    and that certainly wasn't it.  Thanks!
