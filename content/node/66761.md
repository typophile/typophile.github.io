  New/Underconsideration.com</a>, Armin Vit presents Towers Watson\u2019s new visual
  identity, made by Interbrand. One of the key design elements is \u2018Clarity, a
  proprietary handwritten font\u2019.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clarity-ff-mister-k_4935.gif]\r\nOnly
  problem: this is a customized (?) and illicitly renamed version of [[Julia Sysm\xE4l\xE4inen]]\u2019s
  <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_mister_k_pro/\">FF
  Mister K</a>. In the comments, [[Erik Spiekermann]] <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/towers_watson_towers.php#060746\">recounts
  what happened</a>:\r\n\r\n\u201DInterbrand asked Ascender to change a few things
  in the font, to which the licensor, FSI, had agreed. Under the usual conditions
  that the name would not be changed. Ascender delivered a font to Interbrand that
  was called MrK_TW, acknowledging Julia Sysm\xE4l\xE4inen\u2019s original work. Somehow
  (?) the name got changed to \u2018Clarity, a proprietary font\u2019. With this,
  Interbrand took full credit for the design work and probably charged the client
  for designing an exclusive typeface. As it happens, TW hasn\u2019t even got a license
  for the font. [\u2026] As it stands, this is another case of a large design agency
  either being ignorant (which is bad), arrogant (which is normal), or stupid (which
  is very bad). In any case, they're stealing intellectual property, either on purpose
  or out of negligence. This has happened before (anybody remember where UPS got their
  \u2018exclusive\u2019 typeface from?) and will happen again, because while designers
  will complain about being ripped off themselves, they seem to be more lenient with
  other peoples\u2019 property. [\u2026]\u201D\r\n\r\nI\u2019m curious what action
  FSI will take."

    to "Mr K for TW"
