  body: "These samples are great. But they are examples of working around the problem.
    Mine included. @ is an old glyph from (If I remember correctly) Italian book keeping
    manuscripts.\r\n\r\nIt's been in PS1 fonts from the start, for a reason I can't
    figure out. And with e-mail it is now everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd because of that new
    prominance, should this glyph get some standard features? We've interpreted the
    original form (or not), and just worked around it, rather than stopped and see
    why  it looks so awkward.\r\n\r\nCould we find a way to make a standard way to
    incorporate @ to type design? We should be able to do that. Probably fight a lot
    during, but in the end find a good solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. You can see the difference
    of @ and @ by just replying to this and then previewing; Courier has a designed
    @, while (Georgia?) has a generic version."

    is that intrinsically it does not follow any dimensions of the type design; it
    just floats within the ascender and descender, and we try to balance it with baseline.\r\n\r\nI'm
    looking for a sandard form with x-height, ascender and descener to conform with
    the font. That's why my favourite has been a version starting with \"d\"; it still
    has \"@\" shape, but it works with the design, while suggesting to the \"original\"
    form.\r\n\r\nBut that's just me. Better solutions are welcome."

  body: I used to always align it with the figure/cap height, the idea being that
    it was most often used with numbers. Today, it is more likely that it will be

    a raised version in the OT "case" feature.

  body: "@ is not a lowercase letter. It's not a capital letter. It's more like a
    dash, hashmark, asterisk, dagger, para, section. In the context of an email address,
    it shouts \"hey, this is an email address\". If you make it conform too much,
    it doesn't do it's job. When I make an @ . . . I think about the weight . . .
    obviously lighter so it doesn't look too dark. I figure out the vertical placement
    by typing a few email addresses and putting some numerals around it. There's a
    spot that feels comfortable. The top usually ends up about half way between the
    cap and x-height. The bottom, about half way from the ascender to the descender.
    Even when it's used with numbers, aligning with the top of the numerals often
    feels wrong. The @ is a free floating rebel . . . he knows where he's supposed
    to vertically align. There are some all caps display fonts situations where it
    really only makes sense to nail it to the cap and baseline.\r\n\r\nWho's really
    using \"stock\" @ symbols these days anyway. Fonts with parts bin @ symbols were
    made about 15-20 years ago, no?\r\n\r\nI think the less serious a font is the
    more whimsical it should be. It looks so out-of-place when a font has zany letters
    and a serious @. I don't like the \"At\" in place of an @ idea except as an alternate.
    It may not seem so clever to the customer who's trying to use the font to display
    email addresses and ends up having to borrow a proper @ from another font.\r\n\r\nNick:
    I always liked the Scotch Modern @: very cool.\r\n\r\n"

    the female as being encircled by the male, with the only escape space at the bottom,
    and so small to require  dieting to the point of fashion model thinness for any
    possibility of escape. Obviously, the use of the at symbol had to be a male-chauvinist

  body: "Tomi, the problem with starting with a lower case d is if you are then giving
    the character both full l/c ascender and descender depth, which then makes the
    character look too big compared to the other l/c characters (which only have either
    an ascender or a descender, very rarely both (thorn?) and commonly neither. Now
    that's no problem if you subscribe to Ray's view suggested above that that the
    '@' <em>needs</em> to be bigger to do it's job (at least in email addresses) properly.
    But you definitely don't want your '@' looking like its a points size or two too
    big in relation to the rest of the font. \r\n\r\nI'm currently designing an @
    that is optically the same height as the caps but descends optically as far below
    the x-height as it did above. This means that the 'a' part of it, still sits within
    the lower case x-height which is tidy in my head but it's not as tall as the full
    l/c ascender and descender design.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is it then appears to unhealthily
    dip below the baseline in a line of caps so I've done a cap version of it too.
    Messy? Afraid so.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Nick S's design for Scotch Modern is that
    you only need one version of it plus it sits beautifully on the baseline (the
    common reference for all three major styles within a font - upper case, lower
    case and even small caps. (Incidentally Nick, what did you do for small caps?)
    I'm not sure how well the Scotch Modern '@' performs as the kind of stand-out
    character that Ray was talking about but any sort of stand-out character would
    have constituted a defeat in Nick's mind, surely?"

    continuous stroke as in the most usual printed form, but then again I was brought
    up mostly outside of Korea.\r\n\r\nRepeatedly seeing lists where people filled
    in their email addresses by hand finally clued me in to the fact that most Koreans
    write @ as a circled \u2018a\u2019. I'm looking at my old-school mini address
    book right now. Out of 14 email addresses written by my Korean friends, 10 use
    a definite circled \u2018a\u2019 form and only 2 use unambiguous single-stroke
    @s. By contrast, all of my non-Korean contacts use single-stroke @s. It's a small

    of my contacts, but it's fairly representative of how Koreans write the @."
