  size matters\u2014Emotion and attention in cortical responses to written words</a>.
  <em>PLoS ONE, 7(5)</em>: e36042. 1\u20136. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036042\r\n\r\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\r\nFor
  emotional pictures with fear-, disgust-, or sex-related contents, stimulus size
  has been shown to increase emotion effects in attention-related event-related potentials
  (ERPs), presumably reflecting the enhanced biological impact of larger emotion-inducing
  pictures. If this is true, size should not enhance emotion effects for written words
  with symbolic and acquired meaning. Here, we investigated ERP effects of font size
  for emotional and neutral words. While P1 and N1 amplitudes were not affected by
  emotion, the early posterior negativity started earlier and lasted longer for large
  relative to small words. These results suggest that emotion-driven facilitation
  of attention is not necessarily based on biological relevance, but might generalize
  to stimuli with arbitrary perceptual features. This finding points to the high relevance
  of written language in today\u2019s society as an important source of emotional
  meaning.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nPut simply, an ERP is a spike or
  dip in electrical activity in the brain. Below is a photo of a participant I ran
  in an EEG/eye-tracking study. Note the \u201Cbullseye\u201D sticker above her left
  eye. That is actually there for our new headless eye-tracker \u2014 http://www.sr-research.com/EL_1000.html
  . With this setup, we can now monitor eye movements and brain activity at the same
  time. Very cool. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EEG_5277.jpg]\r\n"

    Isn't that what bold type is for? Or all caps? STOP\r\n\r\nI would really like
    to see this brain data used for a different purpose. Our brains must put out a
    different signal when we read hard-to-read type versus easy-to-read type. Once
    we identify those signals, we can (relatively) easily see what typefaces are actually
    good text fonts.  And we could experiment to see what would be the best tracking
    for the good text fonts.  A lot of a speculative, judgmental area would be cleared
    up.\r\n\r\nSo when will we see the retail, off-the-shelf typographers version
    of this rig?"
