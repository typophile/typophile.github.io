body: "So it looks like this work I did quite a while ago: http://typophile.com/node/16393
  is going to be put to use. The magazine is having a 'cover contest' and I worked
  out a few options last night and attached them in a PDF. I'm looking for serious
  crits, I would like to win this competition. :-D I optimized the PDF so it's not
  amazing quality but still should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nhttp://users.adelphia.net/~dabailey/maya.covers.pdf\r\n\r\nPS.
  Still don't have internet at my new apartment so critiques during the day today
  while I'm on campus would be much appreciated otherwise I don't think I'll be able
  to see them till Monday."

    saying that you can't download the PDF from my link?

  body: "No need to apologise, my own fault for laziness in updating.\r\n\r\nI would
    like to see the title have a correlation to the folded paper background (I am
    imagining it as a manuscript wrapper), it seems with the multiply filter (or whichever
    it is) you are trying to make it appear as part of the wrapping but because it
    goes over the edges of the folds it is separate, you could look at making it look
    like it was painted/written. \r\nI am not keen on the type (Bernhard) it just
    doesn't have the right characteristics and the positioning isn't working for me
    I would look at having two lines of copy under the 2nd A and two lines above the
    M (but rotated) they needn't be the same so for example from one position Drexel
    University/Literary Magazine from the opposite First Edition/April 2006. \r\nOverall
    I like the concept of the wrapper but I think it needs further work.\r\nTim"

  body: "Awesome, thanks for the thoughts Tim. Those were some quick ideas and I felt
    like I should get some sort of first impressions.\r\n\r\nAs far as the secondary
    type, I wanted something that was sophisticated but nothing formal...more of a
    handwritten type/scripty feel that would match with the feel of the ambigram."

  body: "That watermark version reminds me of using bleach on inked paper calligraphy
    (worth trying if you have the inclination, not for this project necessarily, just
    a comment in passing). It certainly looks more like a part of the paper rather
    than floating above it. One thing that is troubling is the kink in the lefthand
    vertical of the first A, I understand the purpose just feel it is a bit too much.\r\nThe
    treatment might not be \"commercial\" but if the treatment of other text is sympathetic
    it could work for an in-house magazine (I am not sneering here, it is an opportunity
    you (and I) should relish), have you considered hand-drawing a script for the
    other text?\r\nTim"

  body: "I have not considered hand drawing the other script. This is a student run
    magazine so I have the opportunity to do pretty much whatever I please, provided
    it's not any kind of fancy printing options ie. embossing, varnishing etc.\r\n\r\nRE:
    the 'kink' are you talking about the one right above the crossbar? if so that's
    easily remedied, this 'aging' of the mark was done by crumpling the print out,
    copying, crumpling and copying and scanning it back in. If it's that distracting
    I'll definitely clean it up."
