body: 'This font is a sans serif in the traditional context. I like to think of this
  as a whimiscal font that can be used in text blocks. <BR> <BR>I want to release
  this as a free font, so I&#39;m trying to get everything just about right. The first
  link is the letters and some punctuation, and the second is a poem written by a
  good friend of mine set to Whipple. They are &#42;.swf files so zoom in and tell
  me what you think of the letter forms, fixes for spacing, etc. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: tim <BR> <BR> i like it, it has a script character but with some corrections
    it can stand like a text font. <BR> <BR>i think you should fix some letters that
    are to rigid and doesn&#39;t belong to you font personality.&#40; E, F, h, z,
    8, v, Z, Y, X&#41;, they shouild be solved in a less shy way. <BR> <BR>BTW, i
    think the kerning in the poem is to tight, loose it a little bit. <BR> <BR>CG
