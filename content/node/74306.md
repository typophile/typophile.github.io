  rename the font. In the menu \"Element\"/ Font Infos/..., I choosed TrueType Name
  and in the field \"Unique name\", I wrote TK-GHS. And when I saved the file, the
  font name is \"Untitled\". Do you know why? Have you had a solution.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your reply.\r\n\r\nMako\r\n"

  body: Leave the TrueType name alone; click ELEMENT &gt; FONT INFO &gt; GENERAL,
    then specify FAMILY NAME, and save the file. The file will then have this name,
    as will the fonts you generate.
