    definitely looks like Century but I can't work out which specific version/family.
    It would have been from an older distributed version (TTF/PS) applied around the
    mid 80's.\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the examples below, I can't seem to match
    the lowercase 'c' and the correct weight/stroke of the 't'. The weight of the
    serifs is also a hint.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SMS_examples_6625.jpg]"
