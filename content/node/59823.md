  body: Of the three of these (Janson Text, Kis, a Garamond) which one is the least
    spidery, i.e. with contours that are less fine and difficult to reproduce without
    generational loss?

    Garamond we are talking about) as spidery to me. What are you planning to do with
    it?"

  body: I have to agree with you Jan, but the one strange thing is the <em>f</em>.
    It doesn't match anything. Possibly a rendering issue, but doesn't quite seem
    like it.

  body: That italic f looks like it's tilted up so that it doesn't have to be kerned.
    Perhaps the compositor broke all his kerned f's and resorted to another font,
    or perhaps more likely used a non-kerning version of the font - maybe Linotype?

  body: Definitly Janson Text, and the italic f is out of place for whatever reason
    (although I am not sure this is due to a kerning issue)

    the text I'm replicating makes use of just italics and regular, so I believe I'll

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/12713/jansontext55roman-font.html\">Janson
    Text Roman</a> Std contains 407 glyphs, while the Pro version has 590 glyphs.
    As <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59927\">Dan from Linotype has explained</a>,
    the difference is characters that are needed for Central and Eastern European
    languages. Hence, the Pro is more versatile, but also a bit more pricey. If you
    don\u2019t need those extra glyphs, you\u2019re better off with the Std version.
    Both OpenType versions contain small caps and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59929\">the
    various figure styles</a>.\r\nF"
