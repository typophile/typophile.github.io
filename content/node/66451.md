    "S", Bottom heavy "E", square hole on the "A"?

  body: "I think Jim's suggestion of Pump (Bold) is as close as I have seen. The changes
    you mention would be very simple to make just by converting to outlines and moving
    some points around. For example, the A counter could be closed this way just by
    moving up the bottom corner points of the counter. You could move up the 3 rows
    of points by the E arm to widen the bottom arm and narrow the space on either
    side of the middle arm. Minor tweaking of the S is all you'd need. In other words,
    I think this logo is just tweaked Pump. The basic letter shapes are already there.\r\n\r\n-
