  body: "I think this is a mix of 2 different fonts + some decoration?\r\nThe first
    one must be <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Abaddon%3F%20-%20Regular&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=767d69aa08e35ae8e67cd212c1d2e49d&wrap=2&text=Spell%20your%20name%20with%20songs|Abaddon]]</strong>
    by Dave Nalle  (Scriptorium fonts)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the second one, but
    it could be <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Linotype&ffam=Minion%20Pro%20-%20Medium%20Cond%20Display&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=8b3d3fefa7906b7478b50ff112fb19f6&wrap=2&text=SPELL%20YOUR%20NAME%20WITH%20SONGS|Minion
