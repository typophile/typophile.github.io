  Society of Typographic Aficionados is organizing <a href=\"http://typesociety.org/fontaid/\">Font
  Aid VI: Aster Affects</a> \u2014 a project uniting the typographic and design communities
  to raise funds for <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org/\">Red Cross</a> relief efforts
  after the events of Hurricane Sandy.\r\n\r\nThe project theme will be represented
  in a typeface consisting entirely of asterisks.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why the asterisk?</strong>\r\n\r\nAn
  asterisk can denote something that requires attention \u2014 and an event of this
  magnitude and impact certainly deserves some attention. The asterisk can also provide
  *emphasis* to important information amidst fields of plain text. The root of the
  word comes from the Greek ast\u0113r or \u201Cstar\u201D - signifying hope and light.
  In computer terms, it\u2019s a wildcard character \u2026 and hurricanes are certainly
  wild and unpredictable.\r\n\r\nThis submission deadline is <strong>Saturday, November
  17th, 2012</strong>.\r\n\r\nSee the <a href=\"http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/\">submission
  guidelines</a> for more information.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n\u2014

    \u2014\_Yes, that\u2019s correct. We\u2019ll be treating the asterisks more like
    dingbats than their typographically correct parents. However, since we\u2019re
    producing the final face as OpenType, we could provide a stylistic set which sizes

    at Cooper Union's Type@Cooper program. Like many people, the city is full of my
    friends and family. When I think about Hurricane Sandy, I am brought to the idea
    of 'balance.' It has affected the balance of so many people's lives and daily
    routines. And, the hurricane itself was brought on by a great imbalance in our
    climate. Many of those affected will return to their 'normal' quickly, while others
    will have to find a completely new balance. My asterisk was based off of an 'unbalanced'
    rectangle, repeated 6 times. \r\n"

    *DisAsterRisk*\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-wing ideology and its aggressive defence of capitalist
    modes of production are complicit in the systemic cause of climate change. Indeed,
    these regimes are not only contributing to the increase and amplification of natural
    disasters, but seek to profit from them also. However, these actions have made
    explicit the hierarchical structures, and so provide an opportunity to challenge
    and transform their destructive modes of production and distribution.\r\n\r\nMy
    contribution represents the manner in which certain forces tear structures apart
    but in so doing enable new allegiances to form. That is, a situation which is
    presented as singular is shown to be multiple. However, this multiplicity is a
    series of differences that share certain commonalities. A duality is revealed.
    Arrows can be discerned in the design \u2013 a clash between a collectivised left
    and a individualistic right that confront each other in an agonistic struggle
    over how society is governed.\r\n\r\nIn their abstraction, the dots can also be
    understood as representations of communication technologies, and computational
    ones in particular. For the binary background presents a dramatic change in how
    politics is practiced and introduces new techniques for profiteering (e.g. high-frequency
    trading)."

    promised a \u201Ca sneak peek soon\u201D (https://twitter.com/typesociety/status/273813481764040705).\r\nJudging
    by past editions, the work needed to make a font from all submissions is pretty
    time consuming. "

    Aficionados, I did mean to prod those goof ball Republicans who are obviously
    trying piss off Republican Governor Christie for coming out just before the election
    in favor of not supporting Romney ...sad stuff indeed.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward
    to grabbing a license of this font tho. I hope our collective efforts can bring
    some form of relief. I'm sure we will have plenty of time to contribute in what
    is turning out to be a calamity of a rebuild. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we could also do
    a poster showing all the submissions?\r\n\r\nn. "

    through and purchased it but there was no place to download the font.  Did I miss
    something?
