  body: "well they're fairly neat and simple. but it doesn't really do much.\r\nI
    think your overworking it in all the examples posted.\r\nUsing well chosen and
    set type is not a crime - read: you don't need to add bits and pieces like joining
    the I and the H etc (it doesn't add anything).\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: "I'm just not sure if branching out of the helvetica bubble would be worth
    while or if i should just leave it at that.. i'm not necessarily trying to \"brand\"
    her just using the text as the entrance for her website.. \r\n\r\nI am possibly
    playing with the idea of including a cross section of her painting as a visual
    element but not sure if that what be worth it.. \r\n\r\n@ratbaggy.. thanks for
    the advice.. i have been following your feeds..i think you have some nice ideas"

  body: "if you want to include her art ... fill the letters with it. it doesn't have
    to be the same every time it's seen - the letterforms are consistent the fill
    is flexible yada yada\r\n\r\nI'd suggest finding something other than Helvetica
    ... just cause I think it's a cop out. But there's nothing wrong with that.\r\n\r\na
    little research shows Shani is a deaf artist ... that's a pretty distinct point
    of difference. while everyone's experience of the world are different hers is
    going to be totally different from the 'norm' - presuming it's the right Shani

  body: "epsil: ... inspired by a font? but yes on reflection I guess the grey and
    font are similar to software thingy (how's that going btw?) ... it's also got
    a bit to do with how the last font in Illy stays the font for next click etc.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think Trade Gothic is the way to go either ... but it worked for illustration

    out of letters of primary text. That's not to say it's a rocket science of the
