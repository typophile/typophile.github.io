  for an idea of where I hope to be one day, I came across <a href=\"http://www.paperjamdesign.com\">Paper
  Jam</a>, a fantastic company situated half an hour away from where I live.\r\n\r\nOne
  piece which threw me was a design for the opening of Belfast's latest and most luxurious
  hotel, where I'm sure you'll agree their sense of typography is stunning.\r\n\r\nIf
  you could use your infinite wisdom to deduce which typeface they've used, I'd be
  most appreciative.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
