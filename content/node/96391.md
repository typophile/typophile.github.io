  body: "Kepler was my workhorse type before I designed my Brill family, and it remains
    my favourite of Robert Slimbach's designs. I don't care so much for the light
    and expanded styles, but once it has some meat on its bones it is a fine design.\r\n\r\nAt
    my suggestion, it is used for the <em>Dorchester Review</em>, a Canadian high
    Tory journal out of Ottawa. Unfortunately, there is no sign of it on their current
    website, other than in photographs of the journal cover. The neoclassical aspects
    of the design suit the tone of the journal well, while its romantic aspects are
    pleasingly subversive (at least to me)."

      guess \u2013 the subject isn\u2019t  type-related, though (theology), and basically
      I like good typography; therefore \u201Cpersonal\u201D as well."

    point as you are, when deciding which typeface I should use for my thesis. I ended
    up with [[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html|Cycles]] Eleven.
    However given the printing conditions one is faced as a non graphic industry professional
    I probably would advice Cycles Nine.\r\nI never regretted it, and I still think
    it is a magnificent choice. An unobtrusive text typeface with a tamed renaissance
    touch, but enough character to be interesting. \r\n"

    <em>Discover</em>, but I don\u2019t have any current issues at hand to check.
    \r\n\r\nI note that you\u2019re in Denmark, so that probably won\u2019t help you
    much, as the American edition is not likely to be on your local newsstand.\r\n\r\nPlus,
    I recall that this was not a stellar example. They were using a slightly narrow
    cut (possibly mechanically squooshed \u2014 oy!) and the H&Js were doing it no
    favors at all.\r\n\r\n"

    not the easiest typeface in the world to use, but it can work very well if it\u2019s
    treated right. Always give it enough space!\r\n"
