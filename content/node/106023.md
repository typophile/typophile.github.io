  body: "Even with a [[http://www.aim-info.co.jp/5/aimof2.jpg|better sample]], I was
    not able to spot a match for any of these 2 signages. Actually, I'm pretty convinced
    this is no font, more custom letterings. \r\nAnyway, my suggestion if you need
    to reproduce it:\r\n- AIM: trace it, that should be not so hard to redraw it,
    from scratch\r\n- POWER: have a look to these 2 sections at DaFont [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]], they
    are full of fonts such like this ([[http://www.dafont.com/boom-box.font|Boom Box]],
    [[http://www.dafont.com/dodger.font|Dodger]]...) or pick one from the same sections
    and cut it like your sample.\r\nA perfect client, [[http://www.dafont.com/sea-dog2001.font|Sea
    Dog 2001]] could even work for both letterings."

  body: Thank You Ryuk  that's what I was thinking before I posted here. I was just
    hoping it was a font.
