  body: 'Condensed fonts were basically essential in the pre-smart-phone era, as the
    displays were small, had coarse dpi''s and you wanted to cram as much UI or text
    message on the screen as possible. As we move beyond that era the condensed fonts
    are starting to feel clunky. So as much as I love the old font, the new one makes
    sense for high res phones with plenty of screen real estate.  '

  body: "The comparison on the DaltonMaag site is unfair. It only shows one of the
    Condensed weights. Nokia is a big family, including a Wide version (made by Jelle
    Bosma at Monotype) which is far less explicit but therefore perfectly suited to
    being used on UIs. Nokia Serif doesn\u2019t even get a mention at all. Seems that
    Nokia never used it. That puts them far behind cleverer companies who realize
    that they need more typographic expression across all media than offered by 3
    weights of a generic Sans.\r\n\r\nI have posted a <a href=\"http://spiekermann.com/en/downloads\">PDF</a>
    on my blog that contains an early (2002) presentation of the complete family,
    with some comments by me about the shortcomings of these early pre-release fonts.\r\n\r\nEither
    the communication and marketing people at Nokia didn\u2019t bother to look at
    what they had (it seems that they change personnel very often, losing knowledge
    with every generation) or Bruno Maag\u2019s selling talent won the day. It would
    have been a much better idea to look at the existing fonts, analyze them from
    a branding and technical point of view and then bring them into the present. Ten
    years is a long time for any technology, including fonts, but there is no reason
    why old benefits could not be combined with new requirements. Technically, Nokia
    Pure is a great typeface, as everything is that DaltonMaag produce, but it won\u2019t
    be half as memorable as the good old Nokia Sans and Serif were.\r\n\r\nDesigning
    fonts for brands needs a combination of technical and branding know-how and this
    time the engineers seem to have won. Unless, of course, Nokia deliberately wants
    to be as bland as Microsoft.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>a \"bland\" typeface can do one heck of a job</em>\r\nA complete family
    of faces for a brand will include simpler versions as well that may have to work
    in an Office environment. We\u2019ve done versions of Bosch Sans and DB Sans (exclusive
    for Deutsche Bahn, German Railways) to the widths of Arial (which is fitted to
    Helvetica widths) so text wouldn\u2019t re-run in documents that don\u2019t have
    the original font installed. Those are compromises and may look less than perfect,
    but this is what we do to make things work. But this doesn\u2019t mean that all
    the members of an exclusive family of faces for a big brand have to be faceless
    (pardon the pun). All our recent families have included Sans and Serif, normal
    and condensed, even wide and compressed. They all share certain features and belong
    together, not like twins but like sisters, brothers, nieces and nephews. Designing
    one corporate typeface is so 80s and betrays a design philosophy that aims for
    uniformity and is hardly adequate for today\u2019s media requirements. Wo wants
    to read a printed annual report in the light weight of geometric sans? Or tight
    spreadsheets in a generous serif? A brand needs to express all its communication
    in the appropriate visual voice. And type is visual language that needs to whisper,
    shout, sing and murmur, wherever necessary.\r\n"

  body: "I thought Nokia Sans looked good on recent Nokia touch devices but the phones
    themselves failed to conquer the market. It looks obvious Nokia are trying to
    distance themselves from the past in an attempt to seem contemporary.\r\n\r\nDo
    all brands need to be timeless? Is it wrong to rebrand every decade? For a quick-changing
    industry that barely existed 25 years ago, a strong identity that was for some
    time omnipresent and well recognized might be keeping the associations the public
    has with the brand to a certain popular technology that now is a decade old. \r\nPerhaps,
    had Erik's typeface had less character, the association the brand has with the
    now 'old' type of phones would not be so strong and the font could stay.\r\n\r\nIf
    you look at Nokia history it would seem absurd for them to use their branding
    from the time they were selling rubber and paper. Five years old Nokia phones
    are now this: Nokia rubber. \r\n\r\nNokia is trying to rebrand quite desperately,
    and understandably so. Just to think that 4 years ago Nokia E61 was the ultimate
    'internet phone'\u2014this alone brings a smile on my face.\r\nThe game has changed
    and they want to convince everyone they're still on top of it. They want to cut
    the associations with the technology now seen as obsolete.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola on
    the other hand\u2014back when Nokia produced paper\u2014sold sugar water. Now,
    Coca-Cola sells sugar water. They are more of the type of company that could do
    with a 'timeless' brand.\r\n\r\nIs it me or\u2026 Doesn't Dalton Maag's press
    release look a tad ironic with the rotisesque Stroudley they use on their website?\r\n\r\nQuick,
    somebody tell them their brand looks dated!"

    Personally, I've yet to see a single typeface from you (Erik) that I find remotely

    in typography just doesn't really sit well with me. Just like some fashion-designer's

    @typodermic: \r\nI never signed anything with Nokia. I supplied very rough outlines
    for a few weights with incomplete character sets which were turned into complete
    fonts by Jelle Bosma at Monotype. I suppose I could go back to the original sketches
    and make a new typeface, although some people here would find that one old-fashioned
    and tired. So far, however, all my designs from the late 80s (like FF Meta and
    ITC Officina) are still selling quite well. But then again, life is probably too
    short to warm up old ideas. I\u2019d rather work on new ones."
