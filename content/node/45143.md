  body: How old is this design? It reminds me of the slightly squared adaptions of
    Cooper Black I've got in showcard & signwriting books from the '40s & '50s. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/cooper-poster/|Cooper
    Poster]] from Grouptype is the only digitised example I found in a quick search
    but it is a little too ornate. I think there might be a Nick's Fonts one.

  body: The BNSF was formed around 1995, so my guess is the logo was designed around
    that time. Is it possible that it's just custom lettering for the logo?

  body: "1995! I thought you were going to say 1955. As the layout is very irregular
    on that circle yet repeated letters appear to be exact I'm imagining it was done
    with individually cut out letters from a photocopied alphabet. It looks more like
    a signwriter's work than a graphic designer's. You could get a fairly good match
    with the original [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cooper/black/|Cooper
    Black]] given a slightly heavier weight.\r\n\r\nI can also imagine the rather
    clumsily balanced BNSF being copied from a book like the one below and then the
    outer edges cut into for more of a slab serif look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stevens-cooper_5976.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Showcard

  body: ' I''d say it was a custom job, not based on a particular font, but on the
    Santa Fe RR logo. The Santa Fe logo goes back at least to the 1930s. Until Santa
    Fe and Burlington Northern merged in the Nineties, BN used Frutiger (possibly
    modified slightly) on its logo.'
