    Gotham - both have condensed as well as regular. Also love Akzidenz Grotesk.\r\n\r\nSerif:
    Probably something like Adobe Garamond (I know...) because it is so versatile

    Garamond works with almost anything.\r\n\r\nI'd hate to lock myself into something

    or befuddle the reader.\r\n\r\nWhy should I care. \r\nBy selecting only one family
    of type, I've made a commitment to explore possibilities that are important only

    letter shapes around me (as does Clotilde in sand pebbles below) and start setting
    words using items found in the environment.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olyff_pebbles1_4921.jpg]"

    to Meta Design's Transit.\r\n\r\nA little less facetiously than my own \"Handwriting\"
    \u2021\xAC), I am a big fan of older type faces. While more recent designs are
    more appropriate for today's technology, and in many instances are more readable
    and versatile,  I like the look of a classic type with idiosyncratic characters,
    non lining numerals and a little bit of ink squishing out around the edges. Maybe
    a Bodini - but hand tooled, and where the 's's look like 'f's. If I'm living in
    a world with but one typographic note, I'll choose a warm, sensual and aesthetically
    pleasing one over an efficient, practical, higly readable font. \r\n\r\nAs a signage
    designer, whose been around for a long time, I'm also fond of the look of a hand
    drawn, cut or painted letter in signage and display type. I may be a tad anachronistic,
    but I like to see the hand of the person who made it evident in the execution.
    These days when it is so easy to reproduce perefectly formed letters, it is often
    a relief to see hand drawn lettering, even if slighlty amaturish."
