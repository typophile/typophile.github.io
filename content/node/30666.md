  Electra.  Does it sort of work?  Any suggestions? \r\n\r\nI am a <em>complete</em>

  body: "The indented title above the rag-right layout seems neither here nor there.
    I think it will work better left aligned or centered over the longest line of
    the poem--something Bringhurst mentions. \r\n\r\nIs the title's font Univers?
    I would think that something more 'flavored' might work better. Just Electra in
    a heavier weight or larger size may work very well, depending on the nature of
    the poetry. Using all the same typeface will give a quieter effect.\r\n\r\nAlso
    I don't know about the grey. If you want grey you will probably have to up the
    weight of the title so it balances with the text.  \r\n\r\nOn tracking: Since
    you said your concern is how it will look laser-printed to send to publishers,
    you would best experiment with its effect on the printed product. How it looks
    on screen is not reliable, as the laser printing will thicken it, and screen always
    looks different anyway. \r\n"

  body: "bojev & William, thanks so much.  \r\n\r\nI agree completely with the title
    placement - somehow wherever I put it, it draws too much attention to itself,
    which is why I eventually greyed it out a little - perhaps I'll try electra for
    it, and fool around with it more.  \r\n\r\nNo doubt Bringhurst - when he arrives!
    - will shed some light on all this.  cheers!"

  body: "I wonder if it might be worth trying to output your pages with an <em>inkjet</em>
    printer. My Epson 900 (PostScript, quite old now) and Epson 2200 (bought in 2004,
    not PostScript) both make the color of the type significantly darker than my Apple
    LaserWriter 360 (13 years old and still going strong!!!). The LaserWriter is truer
    to the digital original, but in the case of what you desire for the Electra, you
    don't want faithfulness, you want fullness!\r\n\r\nAs Patty said above, the digital
    version of Electra is pale and skinny compared to the original metal version,
    I think in large part because what's missing in the digital is the effect of the
    ink squeeze that would always be present in letterpress printing on uncoated paper.
    Let me be clear about results, too: this is with digital type fonts output to
    an imagesetter and printed by offset, vs. brass matrices used to cast lines of
    type which are then printed by letterpress, well printed and not overinked.\r\n\r\nBelow
    you will find a comparison between the original 12-pt. Electra set in metal, and
    a digital version also set at 12-pt. The scan of the metal Electra was carefully
    made and was not altered to make it look heavier. It comes from the actual booklet
    released by Mergenthaler Linotype to announce the type in the 1930s.\r\n\r\nNo
    wonder you think there is a difference!\r\n\r\nSo I'd say if you like Electra
    (and it's a wonderful type!), play around with different papers and output devices
    to see if you can gain some body weight in your final printed versions, even if
    the type looks too scrawny on-screen. After all, the only thing that matters is
    the appearance of the final printed result in the hands of the reader, not how
    you got there.\r\n\r\nHope this is of some help.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/electra_letterpress_digital_6605.gif]"

  body: "Yes, obviously there were subtle changes whenever any font was adapted from
    metal to film to digital, but for some reason the digitization of Electra is particularly
    anemic.\r\n\r\nI find that I get a slightly fuller look from the laser printer
    than the inkjet though. I use a Ricoh laserprinter which can go up to 1200 dpi
    but I usually print at 600. My inkjet is 2880 dpi. But you should play around
    until you get the look you want."

    were designed to be point size specific (10pt was different from 12pt, which was
    different from 24pt, etc.), photo and digital fonts tend not to be. Often, the
    new digital font is based on <strong>one</strong> of the older specific sizes
    only.\r\n\r\nElectra's digital version has both text and Display cuts (http://www.linotype.com/363/electra-family.html).
    I know that even the text is light, compared with the metal version. I don't know
    much about the birth of the digital version. I think it was prepared at Mergenthaler
    Linotype in the US, while there was still a design office there, in the early
    1990s."

  body: ">tracking work proportionally to font size?\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, large
    sizes need to be tracked tighter, unless they are 'optical sizes' designed for
    that size. \r\n\r\nThat's why the screen is unreliable, and proofing highly desirable:
    at large screen sizes--necessary because of low screen resolution--what will look
    good will be too tight in a 10 or 12 point print out. \r\n\r\nBecause of the lightness
    of Electra (a fault in the digital type), Bob may well be right that it benefits
    from tighter tracking at text size. From a type designer's point of view, at text
    sizes the designed spacing should work well as a default. "

    yes, the digitization is missing some of the warmth, but it is still a beautiful

    reduced contrast, but it also quite a bit shortens the ascenders and descenders.
    That means at a given nominal size it will be blacker and reduced contrast--and
    so resemble more the print, though I don't know how closely. However, squashing
    the extenders (especially the g) seriously changes the look of the face. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    some of the Dwiggens experts can tell us more about the history of  Elante. \r\n\r\nedit:
    looking a McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces\", I don't find it. So it was never
    available generally in metal. I am guessing it was a modification for phototype,
    as in that era they *loved* the big x-height. There are probably other differences,
    but the extenders was the first thing that hit me. "
