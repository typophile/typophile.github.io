body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI have observed an odd behavior with a font. In the attached
  InDesign CS4 screenshot, selected in the Glyphs panel is the glyph I'm trying to
  enter. Selected in the text is the combination of glyphs that results. The font
  is Rachana, a free (GPL) TrueType font for the Malayalam script. The character in
  question is an akhand, a ligature of three characters: 0D15 + 0D4D + 200D. The latter
  (200D) is the control joiner character, and all other akhands that use it have the
  same problem. But no other akhand does.\r\n \r\nSo, how do I make the correct glyph
  appear? Any ideas?\r\n \r\nLeo"

  body: "I've found that InDesign won't allow you to insert all characters from scripts
    which it doesn't support. The problem is essentially that it doesn't actually
    insert that ligature when you select it from the glyph palette, but rather the
    sequence of base characters from which it is composed. However, in cases where
    the font relies on shaping features which InDesign doesn't support, you never
    end up with the intended result.\r\n\r\nI haven't ever found a way around this
    short of duplicating the desired character within the font such that InDesign
    doesn't see it as an Indic (in this particular case) character and thus just treats
    it as a simple glyph. Of course then your document isn't going to play well with
    others.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thanks, Andr\xE9!\r\n\r\nBut InDesign appears to support the \"akhn\" tag
    well enough with other akhands, at least in the TrueType Rachana. I have tried
    the OpenType version, and discovered that ALL akhands have this problem in OpenType.
    Odd.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps, as you suggest, I may embed the glyph elsewhere--not
    necessarily in another font, but in the private area of the same font, as a standalone
    character not tagged with \"akhn.\" Could anyone suggest a cheap, lightweight
    tool to accomplish this? I don't want to shell out several hundred dollars only
    to fix a single character that appears exactly twice, in two instances of the
    same word, in my document.\r\n\r\nLeo"

  body: "I believe you can get InDesign to use the actual glyph by utilizing its GID
    (Glyph ID). This is a bit of a hack, but might accomplish what you want for your
    limited situation.\r\n\r\nI believe you can only do this via an InDesign Tagged
    Text document. It will be helpful if you are already familiar with InDD Tagged
    Text and its syntax. If not, you might research a little to familiarize yourself.\r\n\r\nThen
    try this:\r\n\r\nFirst, in the Glyph palette, hover over your desired glyph until
    the info box appears and then make note of the GID #.\r\n\r\nThen, select your
    text and use File > Export... to export as Adobe InDesign Tagged Text format.\r\n\r\nOpen
    the resulting text document in a text editor. Where you want your glyph to appear
    place this code: \r\n\r\n<code>&lt;pSG:##&gt;&lt;0xFFFD&gt;&lt;pSG:&gt;</code>
    \ &nbsp;(where <code>##</code> is the GID number of your desired glyph).\r\n\r\nThen
    reimport the text back into your InDesign document. You  may need to fiddle with
    the import options to make sure it reads your tagged text correctly. (This is
    where being familiar with InDD Tagged Text can help you troubleshoot.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    will probably be easiest to manage if you just export the single paragraph that
    contains your problematic glyph. Then reimport into a separate text frame and
    copy and paste back into your main text.\r\n\r\nBecause this references the specific
    glyph order, your text will only display reliably with your specific font and
    won't necessarily translate to any other.\r\n\r\nHTH.\r\n\r\n"
