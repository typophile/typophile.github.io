body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nDenedo is a font based in one of the impossible alphabets
  created by the Italian graphic designer Nedo Mion Ferrario during the 60's and 70's
  in Caracas, Venezuela, South America. As Maurits Cornelis Escher impossible shapes
  and optical ilusions, Denedo is a font impossibles to construct in three dimensions
  because it only exists as a drawing. The balance and incongruity of its forms is
  stressed in big sizes. All your comments will be very helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm really digging this font. As a fan of M.C. Escher, I always
    like to see how he has inspired others. I think this works well as a unique display
    typeface. How close is this to the original lettering of Ferrario? I would love
    to see some examples of his letters.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though some of the lowercase
    letters are too intricate for the x-height (s,z) and appear crushed. Increasing
    the x-height would fix that, although I can see you'll have to modify the angles
    as well.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe this is an endearing trait, as many fonts like this
    have odd facets that make them unique. The spur on the top of the \"1\" looks
    a tad too long and it may be confused for a 7. \r\n\r\nOverall, though I think
    it looks great. I would love to see a version with curves instead of angles. You
    should also play with the width, a wide version could be cool. I would also like
    to see a fully filled in version with no slices through at all. \r\n\r\nNice!"

    for a display font!\r\n\r\nHere's my modest opinions: \r\n\r\nI believe that there
    are some formal problems that attempt against the legibility in some signs: z,
    s, B, E, etc.\r\nThe font is close to be \"rigid\" because its letterforms were
    do without curvature. Perhaps it's interesting to combine curved and straight
    shapes for achieve \"softening\" in some glyphs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the x-height could
    be bigger, to improve the legibility, i don't kwow.\r\n\r\nBest regards and keep
    working, you're doing good! :)\r\n\r\nelsebra\r\nwww.elsebra.com.ar"

  body: "A really great idea, but very hard to pull off - as can be seen in some glyphs
    which exhibit a moderate complexity and not impossibility. My hunch -just a hunch-
    is that you might have to be less literal, leave more to the imagination of the
    viewer, and focus on the overall texture, not the effect of each individual letter...
    In any case keep at it - it might all click well enough!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    be you could improve ir by trying to keep vertical/side stems always wider than
    horizontal/top&bottom stems. Strokes could also be round when needed, without
    failing tou your concept, which, by the way, seems excellent to me. Best regards,\r\n\r\nC\xE9sar

  body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nMatthew:\r\n\r\nM.C. Escher was a genius. I don't
    really know if he was Nedo's inspiration. I suppose it and that is why I think
    his impossible figures influence him. It is almost impossible to find information
    about Nedo's alphabet in the internet. Attached you will find a PNG file with
    the numbers of this font I am working on; based on that I am building the complete
    alphabet. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/denedonumbers_cfcg_5106.png]\r\n\r\nRegarding
    what you said about the lower case letters, you are right. The \"s\" and \"z\"
    are a little divorced. Number \"1\" and \"7\" have to be redesigned.\r\n\r\nSergio:\r\n\r\nI
    will try to follow your advice. The work that is remaining is a lot.\r\n\r\nHrant:\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you mean when you talked about being less literal and leave more to the reader
    imagination?  Do you think I am spending much time designing each letter details
    and not bearing in mind the global effect of the entire alphabet together?\r\n\r\nC\xE9sar:\r\n\r\nI
    think the 2 up and down thick sticks are used like a rail to guide the eye between
    all the optical effects shown. That is why I think they have to remain as they
    are, thicker than the vertical sticks.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your time and comments!\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nCarlos

    topology... impossible :-) you might as well loosen your \"rules\" to end up with
    something that simply conveys the mood of impossibility through actual impossible
    topology on the part of some letters but also nice 3D structures (like the numeral
    2) as well as simply decorative detailing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think this is really interesting. Great concept and it really is looking
    strong. Will you use this privately first to boost a clients project? I hope you
    do. If I could letter or design type I wouldn't be so quick to release the typefaces
    until I was able to use them for clients.\r\n\r\nRedundant thought: My only concern
    about some of these great display typefaces that people are doing is that they
    aren't keeping them private long enough to use them on their own first. (Although
    you might and so I'm not saying this only to you.) \r\n\r\nBut does it have to
    be a commercial typeface? "
