<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I'm sure that less than 1% of women work in advertising agencies.
But perhaps you're really wondering what percentage of advertising agencies' employees are women?

<div class=commentbody>I would say the majority of working graphic designers are now women. I have no empirical evidence. I have been to numerous design offices and can just say that somewhere along the way in recent years, women seem to have increased in numbers in the field.

<div class=commentbody>There are definitely more women than there used to be working in ad agencies, probably nearing a 50/50 mark. However, it depends on whether or not you are only interested in the design aspect or the company as a whole. I find that Creative Directors are often still men, there tends to be more women Associate Creative Directors, near split in Art Directors and slightly more men in Senior Designer roles. But, beyond design there are predominantly more women in other roles - account managers, traffic managers, HR, etc.

Given then only perhaps 10% of designers in ad agencies are creative, I'd say that leaves us with about 5% of employees in ad agencies are female creative designers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do a bit of freelancing at agencies here, and as far as I can tell, women are more in the role of account managers etc or in the production side of things, just as Shu wrote. Very few seem to make it through the glass ceiling to get to the Creative Director or even Art Director level (I really don't know how to call all these jobs, they seem to changing every year!). Those who make it, are often given feminine accounts, such as cosmetics, clothing, maybe travel. Mind you, I used to work with a female art director for a petrol station chain, but even that was more about gardening tools and chocolate than petrol. There seems to be more female copywriters than art directors.
All this is just my gut feeling, no science about it. Ambitious young men get hired and promoted, when young women don't. I suppose the main reason is, that the young man is unlikely to go on maternity leave (here in Finland you can be absent up to about four years and still expect to have a job waiting for you).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mili, your gut feeling might be right for Finland, but not the rest of the world. I am a girl and an art director in a major canadian agency. My main accounts are General Motors, Microsoft and Nestle. And I'm not an oddity
Missgiggles who are you emailing? Most agencies have a general info email, and they probably won't answer your question because of the trouble you can get in when dealing with gender issues in advertising. Especially if it's a man doing the answering. Research what happened to Neil French. And another reason you probably aren't getting answers is because the general info lines usually go to someone who doesn't work in the creative department.
Phoning is a much better way to get a hold of creative people. If you want I can give you some names of prominent female creative directors who would be willing to maybe answer your questions about women in advertising. </div>

<div class=commentbody>To actually try to answer the question.... My impression is that the majority of students studying graphic design these days are female, and my observation is that the majority of attendees at general graphic design sorts of conferences are female - maybe 60-65%?

Are you still getting over nipple fonts? I hope you response means in a positive way... I can't take much more in negative statements this year. I think my quota was used up.

I'd suggest calling them directly and ask to speak to an HR rep within the organization who could probably directly assist you with these types of questions.

Yes, Chris, but in Alabama the Tuscaloosa!
But seriously folks... I will try to get actual stats from where I work (Mullen.com). We're part of InterPublic, who owns several major agencies.
From current view here at Mullen, I would say women hold 50%-60% of position nearly across the board (except for the "Board"). We do have a couple of managing partners who are female.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Okay guys - for my original comment that not all of the 50% women are women - I was referring to the gay GUYS in the offices who do a lot of creative work and consider themselves women. Hope that clears it up. Never knew it could have been interpreted any other way... but hey, these are typed words - not verbally expressed ones.

I'd just like to add my comment -- growing up with designers in the publishing world this was the case. By 30 they were either made an Art Director and knew that they had found the right house to stay in until retirement -- or they were cast out into the world of freelance only to be seen during occasional lunches or cocktail parties.
I wonder if Ad agencies were the same.
I only worked with one in New York City - it was a trade to trade house - to it wasn't as crazy as the ad agencies selling to the general public. There the art dept. consisted of 4 people. All males - and three of them had the title of Art Director. I still remember the day the Mac computers were delivered...</div>

Totally disagree. One of the things I like about publishing is that it is NOT youth-quake oriented, and in fact age and experience are appreciated and respected. I was made Art Director at 30 but that was considered very young, and they let me know they felt they were taking a gamble on me cuz of my age (luckily it worked out). Five years later I lost an AD position at another publisher because I was too young. You find designers and editors of all ages working in publishing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thomas -
I don't think you read it right at all.
Of the 50% woman - not are all women - because some are GAY ARTISTS - meaning MALES.
Some of them - are known to cross dress. If you have ever been friends with one - you would find out, they think like women, consider themselves women -- they just can't go to a woman's bathroom in public without risking a fine.
So please Thomas - tell me how that is offensive?
I am not the one who mentioned or even thought of lesbians. Ricardo did - and then apologized. He wrote <em>"Oh, sorry, Jackie — I thought you were refering to lesbians! My misinterpretation."</em>
So I am sorry I did not write it in simple English -- but I know that when I explained what I wrote - Ricardo got it.
Why didn't you?
So to be absolutely clear and put in the easiest terms I possibly can. Maybe that will help you.
In the creative fields there are many who were born as men, but believe they are woman. So of work places when you say 50% are woman - you might find yourself including those born as males but believe they are woman in that count.
Clear now?
After all, they do believe they are woman. Would you deny them their beliefs? I don't.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm with Thomas on this one. It is offensive and extremely stereotypical to suggest that gays want to be women. A very small percentage of gay males regularly dress as women (Hallowe'en excepted, perhaps). And these cross dressers do not _want to be female_. They would react as negatively to that idea as most men would. The just like dressing in female attire, but know all the time that they are men pulling a charade.
The only males who would seriously want to be female are transsexuals (I include here the category transgendered), and these people (who feel they were born into the wrong gender) represent a small fraction of 1% of all gays.
I consider the suggestion that all gay males want to be women to be the equivalent to suggesting that all blacks are criminals, just because a small fraction of blacks have been convicted of a crime.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It may be either important or irrelevant (depending on your views) to consider that [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_transsexualism|legal recognition of transexualism]] varies from country to country (or state to state, as in America).

Gender identity, sexual orientation and cross dressing just for the sake of having pleasure from wearing women's clothing (done by many self-identified "straight" males BTW), and dressing as a "drag queen" for entertainment purposes are VERY different issues.

I would guess that far less than 1% of women work in advertising agencies.
And I now see that Thomas made this observation previously. Pointless post FTL.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was in P-town for a wedding (a legal gay wedding) and it was "Tall Ships" weekend. The town was crawling with straight men dressed in women's clothes, often with their wives. They were not drag queens, the clothing was not flamboyant or campy, and it was not always a pretty sight. Ya gotta credit the wives for being supportive.
Gender identity and sexual preference are not the same thing, although they are often conflated.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, it is slippery ground. However, spending more than 20 years in New York City working with art directors of all types and being very active social with so many (many of whom are now 6 feet under) I can guarantee you, they would not be offended - they'd be laughing.
I'm sorry, this is really all on how we were raise, the tolerance levels we've set for ourselves, our friends and yes, something America has forgotten, our sense of humor.
Sorry you've not experience the life I have and I am sorry I've not experience yours. Among my dear departed friends this would have been another thing to laugh out. Maybe you should have been a fly on the wall at our lunches -- then you'd know what offensive meant!
From an old, tired typographer - if I should have offended anyone, I'm sorry -- but that was not the case or intention.
Guess I'm also tired of political correctness - so Happy Hanukah, Merry Christmas, Merry Kwanza and of course, Happy New Year and Chinese New Year to all.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's certainly not a question of me not having a sense of humor. I just have a problem when anyone puts misconceptions and generalizations - about any group of individuals - out there in such a public manner. The problem is there are a large number of people who buy into such misinformation as the truth about the group being discussed without a second thought.
For me the treatment of gays, lesbians, transgendered and others determined to be "different" by employers or co-workers is no laughing matter. In 1985 I was fired from a job - with an advertising agency - for no other reason than being gay. The owner was "uncomfortable" having a gay male working in his office. At the time I had no legal recourse. In fact, today in over half the states in the U.S. that is still the case.
"Dear departed friends" had little to do with some of the earlier comments posted. However, in honor of mine, I always address inappropriate or false comments about gays, lesbians and others when they are made in any public situation. I certainly don't need to be subtly reminded of gay history in this country - I've lived it.
Happy holidays to all, as well.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Thank you Ricardo.
Miss Giggles - without meeting a person, seeing their face, their expressions, etc. you really haven't a clue as to how or what was said. Words are wonderful, and can always be taken out of context.
Fortunately this world is made up of so many different types of people - each with their own experiences that help shape them and mold them. My sense of humor does not seem to be particularly cared for by a few here - yet, I'm sure if they knew me and we were sitting around over some coffee or wine - we'd be the best of friends quickly.
So, Miss Giggles, I hope you take Ricardo's advice, reread this thread, including my explanation of my humor -- and understand - there was no bullying of any type going on.
And on that note - I think I'm done with this thread.
And I wish all of you a wonderful, happy, healthy new year.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>its HER saying she has done all my projects for me!</em>
Oh, you mean this?:
Jackie said... <em>we are familiar with the helping the creator of this thread with all her school projects in the past</em>
Well, Miss G, Jackie's actually saying that we've all <em>helped</em> you with your school projects... That is not the same as <em>doing</em> them, is it? And be honest with yourself: you have actually asked people to come up with ideas for your schoolwork in the past, so you can't honestly be offended by a comment like that...
I assure you that I am not bullying you when I say this, it's just some advice: read things a bit more carefully, and think things over before writing something down and hitting the "Post" button... It will save you a lot of trouble and lead to better communication.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"You guys just defend each other on here. You just don’t want any new comers do you? It must be an age thing!"
The reason threads you start end up this way is that you tend to come in with a rather 'hot button' topic and pitch in with a bit of bias. As such, you are likely going to stir up a heated conversation.
I don't think this has anything to do with your age...I don't think most of us have any idea how old anyone is in here.
That said, your last 4 or 5 comments clearly make you appear to be around 12 years old.
In the end, if you ask a question looking for free advice/opinions, don't be picky about the results.</div>
