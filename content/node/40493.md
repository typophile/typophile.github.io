body: I'm having problems using <a href="http://www.evertype.com/emono/">Everson Mono</a>
  with Adobe InDesign. Only a few glyphs show up. (I'm on a Mac, if that's relevant.)
  Using it with Illustrator works like a charm, but due to some wierd reason InDesign
  won't play along. I contacted the designer, Michael Everson, who told me Adobe apps
  in general aren't to happy about Unicode, but didn't bring me any closer to a solution.
  Does anyone know what the exact problem might be, or even better, how I can get
  it working properly?

    not sure that's what's causing the problem. Running the font through MS [[Font
    Validator]] outputs a few errors that seem to be serious (image below), specially
    the one that says that \"The subtable length is zero\". The font, BTW, has 4899
    glyphs (according to FLS5, at least).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/everMono_errors_5403.png]"

  body: "Word (Mac) doesn't like the font either.\r\n\r\nThe problem is definitely
    a font bug: Miguel got one of our engineers to do a big of spelunking, and he
    found that there is an error in the header of the 32 bit Unicode cmap subtable.
    The length of this subtable is set to 0, even though the rest of the subtable
    contains valid data. A variety of programs fail to deal well with this error,
    while many others are just fine.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it would be nice if InDesign
    dealt more gracefully with the font bug than it does, so Miguel logged a bug on
    the InDesign side as well.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
