  body: "Hi Robin.\r\n\r\nNormally if you'd like to get a font identified, one would
    use the type ID forums here on Typophile (http://typophile.com/typeid) as opposed
    to the general discussion forum. And for best results I would give it at least
    a day or two. We're mostly human after-all! :-)"
