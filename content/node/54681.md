  I understand that part of their function is to indicate a dramatic pause, but I
  find them hard to decifer especially with text messenging and emails. They always
  seem to imply a sense of irritation or impatience. Maybe my point is that they are
  digitally overused.\r\n\r\nDracula gives an example of the malicious ellipses: \"I
  never drink ... wine\"\r\n\r\nAnyway I wrote a post on my take of ellipses if you
  are interested.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typeandglyph.com/2009/02/dot-dot-dot/"

  body: "I think it's mostly used in electronic communication to indicate gaps in
    reasoning and tangential thoughts without suffering the hassle of exploring each
    strand to it's logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt saves lots of space, as you relegate
    the work of finishing your sentences to your unfortunate readers, leaving clues
    of varying vagueness in your slothful path.\r\n\r\nSo the above can translate
    to:\r\n\r\nHa! Like... its EZ 2 do... + more fun n all.\r\n\r\nBellyfeel doubleplusgood.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "I think you bring up a good point about use of ellipses, although to me,
    they're underused, not overused.\r\n\r\nToo often I see people using periods when
    they should be using ellipses. \r\n\r\nI'm worried that ellipses are going the
    way of the semicolon, being misunderstood and underused."

  body: "They are also used to indicate someone's voice trailing off... or an unfinished
    thought. And, of course, between parentheses they indicate that some text has
    been omitted.\r\n\r\nCheck out the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis\">Wikipedia
    entry</a>. I like the part where it states, \"The use of ellipses can either mislead
    or clarify, and the reader must rely on the good intentions of the writer who
    uses it.\""

    *that's* an endorsement! "

  body: Thanks for all the responses. I find ellipses fascinating because they have
    a very emotional quality both grammatically and typographically.

    character was banned. Instead \r\nthe edited manuscripts contained three spaced
    periods.\r\nIt led to published books with hilarious consequences .\r\n. . "

  body: I told a client last week that their copywriters' constant use of ellipsis
    made them sound like a teenager's livejournal. For what it's worth.
