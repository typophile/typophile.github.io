  body: "Just to be clear here. The original design is not a font but a custom logo
    work. 'Journey PS3' by Hauke Petersen is a fan work, an attempt to extend a logotype
    into a keyable font which is clearly stated on by the author himself on DaFont
    page Dick refers to.\r\n<blockquote>This font is based on the title card of the
    Video Game \"Journey\" by thatgamecompany for PlayStation 3. The 7 letters within
    the game's name use and original design and are not part of complete font set.
    Since it looks so nice, I decided to create a full-fledged font by creating the
    remaining characters based on the official design.</blockquote>"
