  body: "There's a kind of uneven quality about the way these letters are formed that
    suggests to me that this is hand-drawn. The height and size of the l compared
    to the d is an example of what I mean. (I guess it's also possible that it's an
    amateur font design, but I'd be surprised if a commercial script would be designed
    to fit together so poorly.) The G is similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/grocers-script/\">Grocers
    Script</a>/Philly Sport Script, but the looped l and d are not at all like those
    fonts.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the lettering was modeled after existing type styles,
    but that it was done by hand.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It's the l and d that are getting me, too. The other letter's are very similar
    to the font Commercial script, but it doesn't have loops on the l and d.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else have any ideas?"

  body: "There are very few 'formal' style scripts with looped d's, even when other
    ascenders are looped, and those are much more elongated than your sample. I have
    not had time to check the 'casual' scripts in Part 7 of the Script Guide, but
    that's my last suggestion.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
