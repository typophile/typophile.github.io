body: "I've made a calt to add swashed alternatives to beginning and end of every
  word. I think it's ok, but I'm planning also stylistic alternatives to these swashes
  and it's here where it gets complicated. I get \"Duplicate target glyph for single
  substitution\" error when compiling. This is what i have now:\r\n\r\nClasses:\r\nAll_glyphs
  (All glyphs, including swashes. 986 total)\r\nNormal_Caps_Start (Starting glyphs
  to be replaced. 170 total)\r\nNormal_Caps_End (Ending glyphs to be replaced. 133
  total)\r\nSwash_Caps_Start (Starting glyph swashes. 170 total)\r\nSwash_Caps_End
  (Ending glyph swashes. 133 total)\r\n\r\nCode:\r\nfeature calt { \r\nlookup start_swashes
  {\r\n    ignore sub @All_glyphs @Normal_Caps_Start';\r\n    sub @Normal_Caps_Start'
  by @Swash_Caps_Start;\r\n} start_swashes;\r\nlookup end_swashes {\r\n    ignore
  sub @All_glyphs @Normal_Caps_End';\r\n    sub @Normal_Caps_End' by @Swash_Caps_End;\r\n}
  end_swashes;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nI've put calt feature after salt feature.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem must be in the way i made the classes. For example letter A has A1 and A2
  alternatives. In Swash_Caps_Start this means: [A1, A2, B...], and in Normal_Caps_Start
  class its [A, A, B...]. This way the substitute classes have the same amount of
  pairs, but there are two A's in the other class. How is this done correctly?\r\n\r\nProbably
  there is some really simple solution for this, but now i just can't figure it out.
  I've searched for this, but Google doesn't anymore give the results from Typophile
  it has used to."

    trying to replace {A, A, B ... } with {A1, A2, B ... }, and the software cannot
    determine whether A should be substituted by A1 or A2. If you have a rule of the
    form <code>sub @A by @B</code>, it's perfectly OK to have the same glyph listed
    multiple times in class B, but generally <em>not</em> in class A.\r\n\r\nWhat
    you need to do is map {A, B, ... } to {A1, B1, ...} and then substitute A1 by
    A2 in some lookup which occurs later in your features.\r\n\r\nAlso, on an unrelated
    note I suspect that there is an error in your 'calt' code. I think that where
    you write:\r\n\r\n<code> ignore sub @All_glyphs @Normal_Caps_End';</code>\r\n\r\nyou
    actually want the following (assuming you're trying to get the substitution to
    occur only at the end of a word, i.e. where no glyph <em> follows</em> the target
    glyph).\r\n\r\n<code>ignore sub @Normal_Caps_End' @All_glyphs;</code>\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thanks Andr\xE9, sounds reasonable. Do you mean that A to A1 substitution
    happens in the calt feature and the A1 to A2 substitution would then be in salt,
    which would be positioned later in the feature order?"

  body: "If I understand you correctly, A1 and A2 are both swash versions intended
    for initial use, correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, then yes, you'd perform the A->A1 substitution
    in 'calt', and the A1->A2 substitution in 'salt', which would be done <em>after</em>
    your 'calt' feature.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd recommend duplicating your 'salt' feature
    in 'ss01' since InDesign implements stylistic sets but not 'salt', whereas Illustrator
    implements 'salt' but not stylistic sets.\r\n\r\nFinally, don't name your glyphs
    A1, A2, etc. Use a suffix; for example A.1, A.2. Otherwise, you'll run into compatibility
    problems with (e.g.) Acrobat Distiller.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: It all works now, phew. I was just referring the A1 and A2 names to simplify
    my post, but a good point there. Thanks Andre, you've been a great help!
