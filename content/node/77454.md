  to be used for a logo with the H and an ampersand being the main features. Something
  like these: I might well use these below but wanted to see if there are any recommendations?\r\nhttp://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/tutti-paffuti-nf.aspx\r\nhttp://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/emfatick-nf.aspx\r\nhttp://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/elephant-italic-font.aspx\r\n\r\nThanks
