  seen on billboards, cinema's, trams (like these). It's not been used as body text.\r\nI
  think the Holland America Lines used it in their posters as well. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nGurt\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_sample_1_0_3679.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_sample_2_0_4256.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_sample_3_0_5271.jpg]"

  body: I think these were hand-drawn. It's similar to various versions of fonts called
    'Broadway'.

  body: "This is not a single font but rather a general style (art-deco-ish) of fonts.
    These things were not designed with computer fonts back in the 50's ;-)\r\n\r\nBroadway
    is the most familiar one of that class of fonts. You should have that one. find
    [[http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=Broadway&q=Go|similar fonts here]].\r\n\r\n[[http://fontenwerkplaats.blogspot.com/|Richard
    Keijzer]] likes this kind of fonts very much and [[http://home.tiscali.nl/r_keijzer/lettertypes_english.htm|re-creates
    them]] in digital form. Help yourself.\r\n\r\nBTW is it possible to disable the
    link file feature in the ID forum in favour of \"insert image\"? It would be much
    more comfortable to compare these three samples if it were possible to see them
    together with the posting instead of on three different tabs."
