body: "Looking for a new typeface to use for my webdesign company I found FF Meta
  to be potentially the right one. It's modern, clean, no-nonsense, but also a bit
  \"creative\", has a bit more personality. I use Frutiger now, but I'm kind of bored
  with it. I like clean typefaces like Helvetica and Frutiger, but it's just a bit
  too plain. \r\n\r\nHowever, as with many of the \"classics\", Meta is everywhere!
  On trucks passing by, on the ad display next to the road, on the local butcher's
  window, etc. \r\n\r\nSo looking for alternatives. One I still like is Whitney. However,
  it's quite expensive and its license seems a bit too restrictive. If I find a typeface
  I can use on my website (@font-face or typekit) that would be a pre. Otherwise,
  I would have to create images for the main headlines on the site and use that.\r\n\r\nPotential
  alternatives I have found so far\r\n- ITC Officina Sans. Also by Spiekermann. Modern
  and versatile, with just some little details that make it less boring.\r\n- FF Milo.
  At first sight quite plain but also has a few nice details.\r\n- Seravek. \r\n\r\nIf
  I'm correct I can use Milo and Seravek in some way with font embedding for the website.\r\n\r\nAny
  other interesting ones? If I would have to describe the ideal typeface, it would
  be: clean, modern, no-nonsense, friendly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    exactly, but it has a nice friendly yet professional look. Clean but not \"stiff\",
    not too corporate.\r\n\r\nThanks again for this suggestion"

    :)\r\nAnd it would be useful to know if you're looking for a font for (web) text
    or just headlines \u2013 the former would still limit your practicable choices
    somewhat."

  body: "Well at fontspring\r\nhttp://www.fontspring.com/fonts/shinntype/sensibility\r\nthe
    specific @font-face license can be bought so I assume that's legal. If I'm correct
    it's the same font but specifically for the web. And so when I want to use the
    font for print work I will have to buy the regular license as well.\r\n\r\n@Nina:
    I'll want to use the font for both my print work (business card, letter) and maybe
    some headlines on my website. For regular body text I'll just stick with a normal
    font (not-embedded) I think.\r\n\r\nNot sure about the Meta Serif. Feels somewhat
    too formal. Not sure how to say it."
