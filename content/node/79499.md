  Mac. I have bought a new Windows 7 (x64) PC and see that there is no current version
  of Font Explorer X for Windows. I am looking for a comparable replacement. I would
  like the software to have the ability to activate/deactivate fonts and some Adobe
  CS5 integration as I use CS5 a lot in my work. Can anyone make any recommendations?\r\n\r\nAlso
  on a side note, How do I transfer my existing font library to Windows, I know there
  has to be some sort of conversion any help would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Font EULAs frequently do not allow format conversion, but as said above the
    .TTF and .OTF fonts are cross-platform on modern systems. \r\n\r\nFontForge can
    read nearly all font formats, including some of the strange ones the Mac system
    fonts come in (I think it requires BinHexing the resource-fork TrueType fonts,
    I'd have to read through the manual again to be sure) and generate new fonts in
    other formats. Some special features might get munged in the process, though.
    Like I said, most font EULAs do not allow this, and many expressly forbid it.
    Contact the foundry for further information if you're not sure in any particular
    case."

  body: "I am trying the trial version of Suitcase Fusion 3 and find it has similar
    properties to Linotype Explorer it also has plugins for Adobe CS just like Linotype
    Explorer. Does anyone know what the plugins do?\r\n\r\nDo they just allow activated
    font in the Font Manager to appear in the Applications with the plugins installed
    (ie.- Illsutrator, InDesign)?"
