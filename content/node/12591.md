body: "Hello people!\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively simple one - I am looking for a selection
  of fonts to present to a client. The client has asked for a display face in a '50s
  'retro' style accustomed with the stereotyped American diner, gas station etc.\r\n\r\nThe
  first port of call was, of course, FontDiner.\r\n\r\nHowever, fifties retro is not
  really a favourite genre of mine, so has anyone got their own preferred 50's font?\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions welcomed!\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n(<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=MVB.102372.0.0\"
  target=\"new\">MVB Bossa Nova</a> is a start!)\r\n"

    their packages such as <a href="http://www.fontdiner.com/main.html>Country Fair
    Picnic or Lunchbox</a>.
