  body: "The weight on the S seems thicker than the rest of the text. Is it possible
    that the letters are thicker and outlined in white? \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/millar/\">Millar
    Ultra Light</a> has some similar letterforms."

  body: Thanks for your help guys, having had a second look at some other samples
    of the text i think it's created by hand as a lot of the letter forms don't 'fit'
    with one other.
