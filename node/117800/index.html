<p>It started with an idea on a certain flow of lines within the /a but quickly thereafter I removed the terminal and created this sort of naked serif typeface.</p>
<p>I like the a, b, d and r in particular (which is not to say no more adjustments will be made though) but I&rsquo;m rather uncertain about the /c and and /e as they&rsquo;re perhaps too classical. I suppose with this typeface I essentially want to bring a few classical/chirographic aspects and think it through to a logical, modern conclusion. I feel the /o could be wider but I will have a closer look at that when doing more elaborate text samples.</p>
<p>Any criticism is welcome.</p>

<p>Strangely enough this typeface reminds me of Ruse and Collis but I checked and it actually doesn&rsquo;t look like either. I guess it&rsquo;s Ruse&rsquo;s spaciousness and Collis' minimalism which reminds me of Baran. Baskerville also came to mind but obviously that one is way different. I think it&rsquo;s again the spaciousness.</p>

<p>![](/images/old-images/Baran v7_5807.jpg)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an update. I changed c/e. I think they have a much better flow now. The /e is a lot more rounded like the /a. For now I&rsquo;m fine with it but I might change it later. I haven&rsquo;t really decided on how quirky this typeface should be, either.</p>
<p>I also sharpened the beak of /r though I might have overdone it. I also made the /o wider but I&rsquo;m still not happy with it. I would have thought the /o is one of the easiest letters but I actually find it one of the hardest characters to get right – in all of my typefaces.</p>
<p>And I made several variants of /f and decided on this one for now. I&rsquo;m not sure if the terminal is sexy or just too small.</p>

<p>I modified b/c/e/f/r and added g and t.</p>
<p>Last week I stumbled upon [[http://typophile.com/node/54942|this post]] and noticed Hrant&rsquo;s criticism on the classical shape of /g. I figured I would try to design a /g with an open loop but couldn&rsquo;t get it to work so I eventually closed the loop again. I noticed the link in the /g of Romulus is centered rather than at the left and this seems to result in a less obtrusive loop. I also downplayed the link of the bottom loop and put it more to the center. I quite like the result of v9 but I thought I would post the whole evolution of /g so you get more insight into what I&rsquo;m exploring so you may be able to offer more specific criticism.</p>

<p>As for /t, I stumbled upon a small issue I didn&rsquo;t encounter before. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the combination of rounded and sharp lines in the bar of /f and I like how pronounced it is (as the serifs in this typeface are quite long as well) and I noticed how the bar in /f and /t are usually the same so I repeated that element. However, what worked for /f didn&rsquo;t quite work for /t. I shortened the left side of the bar and extended the right and tried to balance the apex of /t with the horizontal. At first I designed the apex to be long and squarish such as in Ruse but it didn&rsquo;t work. I think I just felt forced by the shape and length of the bar to make the apex less pronounced, more or less like Calluna.</p>
<p>After your feedback I can see I overdid downplaying the apex, but the reason for this back story is to ask if you have encountered this &ldquo;issue&rdquo; where the bar on /f doesn&rsquo;t quite work for /t. I&rsquo;ve looked at a few typefaces and I notice the bar is always the same. I personally feel type should be fluid and optical adjustments need to be made (just like I would never rotate a geometric /b to be a /q without making optical adjustments), but since Baran is a lot more rigid (equating to being less fluid) than Garamond for example, I don&rsquo;t quite know to which extent I should repeat elements or make them unique.</p>
<p>I suppose this should be my own decision, but I can&rsquo;t really decide what will work better for Baran. Fluidity or rigidity? I think Baran feels a bit too rigid now. The alternate /e is an overcompensation but I feel like an ascending ear for /g is going to make the typeface less rigid already, which is good I think. I think it needs to be more dynamic. Romanée is a fairly good example of this combination of rigidity and fluidity.</p>

<p>As a result I felt I was forced to raise the ear further. I think it looks less pleasing but also less obtrusive. Does anyone have any suggestions? I considered solving the issue by designing an alternate /g to be used as a ligature but I obviously rather have the issue fixed in the design of the default characters. Maybe the ear just needs to be a bit shorter.</p>

<ul>
<li>I think the /e/ needs more weight in the top left area, perhaps just the left side of the bowl. (I would shift the inner curve a bit to the right).</li>
<li>/f/, on the other hand, is definitely too thin at the upper taper. Wasn’t the last version thicker. I thought its color already looked OK.</li>
<li>/r/’s terminal is too dark (<em>delay</em> its thickening a bit more, perhaps).</li>
<li>The shoulders of /n/, /m/ and /h/ are also a bit too dark to my impression. Independently they look great, though. That doesn’t help, does it?...</li>
<li>A more obvious remark: The strokes of /y/ meet at a too high spot. Especially with your choice of a horizontally cut joint, I don’t think the optical compensation has to be so pronounced or is even necessary.</li>
<li>Either the crossbar of /t/ is too short at the right or its terminal is too long.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really like that slightly asymmetrical but calligraphic detail you have given to the lowercase /o/, by the way :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks a lot for the feedback. I will respond to each statement individually.</p>
<p>e — I actually added more weight to the left side and a tiny bit to the bottom and top right side of /e already but I forgot to update it in the font.
f — Okay, this is one of those areas where I&rsquo;m probably not quite as confident as a type designer yet as I should be. I consciously made the top thinner to have a bit more of excitement going on in the typeface. Now and then I see a typeface with a few letters which are a bit off and thus demand attention; some might say it&rsquo;s obtrusive but I often think it demands just enough attention in a good way. I wish I could remember the names of a few of these typefaces. I can&rsquo;t find it in my collection either. I recently stumbled upon a geometric sans here on Typophile for a big fashion brand but I can&rsquo;t remember which. It featured a lowercase /a with a very thin horizontal at the top of the bowl. I think it did something strange with the /e as well but the rest of the typeface was quite conservative.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess my question is how do you guys know if you&rsquo;re taking things too far? In my older typefaces I was always going for high consistency but it tends to look dull. I want to spice things up a bit but I don&rsquo;t yet have the experience and confidence to know what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. I guess it&rsquo;s quite subjective as well, though I trust your judgement so I usually take your feedback into consideration.</p>
<p>Anyway, looking at the /f in context again I can see it&rsquo;s just too light. It&rsquo;s not a charming feature but an obtrusive one which looks like a mistake. Perhaps that&rsquo;s really the issue. If I want to add a certain feature it should more obviously be a feature.</p>
<p>r — I guess you&rsquo;re right. Looking at the text sample last night I actually wondered if the /r, /t and /y shouldn&rsquo;t be a bit rounder anyway. I&rsquo;m considering making the beak of /r a bit more like the terminal of /f (essentially curving the bottom of the beak inwards a bit more) which should make it less dark as well. I&rsquo;m also considering removing the angle at the left side of the apex of /t and make that a curve.</p>
<p>n/m/h — The shoulders don&rsquo;t look too dark to me. There is more diagonal stress in /d though, so perhaps I should move the weight of the shoulders a bit more to the right so the left side has more space to breath in. What do you think? I will test it out today.</p>
<p>y — I&rsquo;m uncertain about this one in general. I really like the horizontal cut (though I agree it should be lowered) but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s for this typeface. I think I may need more roundness in the letter, so I might make a normal joint or a bit of a curved one like some italic variants of /y. If I were to keep the horizontal cut I should probably add more straight lines in the other letters, such as the leg of /k.</p>
<p>t — I don&rsquo;t think the terminal should be shorter so I will probably have to extend the crossbar. I already extended it compared to the crossbar of /f as they&rsquo;re the same size in other typefaces I looked at, but I guess it&rsquo;s fine to deviate from whatever other people are doing. In fact, this is probably the way to innovate and gradually change type.</p>
<p>o — I always have trouble designing the /o so it&rsquo;s good to know I did well here.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Okay, I just realized the name of one of the typefaces I had a look at for strange characters: [[http://www.urtd.net/fonts/doko|Doko]]. Look at the strange shape of /r. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s obtrusive but it adds a lot of character to the typeface I think. By the way, this really isn&rsquo;t the best example because although the /r is unusual, it does follow the general style of the typeface rather well. It doesn&rsquo;t stand out as much as the /a in the geometric typeface I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t remember if this was in the geometric typeface or a different one but it featured an upright italic /e with a very inwards slope towards the stem. Hence I tried a similar thing for my /e (my 7th comment on this post) to spice things up. Imagine a more exaggerated version of that in a simple geometric typeface&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I updated half the letters. I think the color is more even now as I felt the bowl of /a, /b and /d were a tad too heavy. I think the bowl of /b still might be. I processed all feedback, rounded the left side of the apex of /t, made the beak of /r curve inwards more and added /p and /z. I tried different things for the join of /y but didn&rsquo;t like any of them so I just moved the join down a bit.</p>
<p>I just noticed there&rsquo;s too much space on the right side of /s and the left side of /y but I don&rsquo;t care to update the picture right now. The spacing isn&rsquo;t great anyway; I have a lot to learn there. On that note, does anyone have any tips on how to go about spacing? When one letter pair is perfect an other one becomes less perfect and it seems an endless process. I know I can add kerning pairs but I want to postpone doing that until the basic spacing is more to my liking. With previous fonts I started adding kerning pairs too early and it becomes even more messy.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You retouched the bowl of the /a/ nicely. It now looks more fluid. You also did a good job with the /f/.</p>
<p>I would modify /y/’s terminal to resemble the terminals of /r/, /f/ and /g/’s ear somewhat more. I like the overall shape, though.</p>
<p>Isn’t the ear of /g/ too light?</p>
<p>About giving some letters some extra quirkiness, I believe I share your opinion. I think it is totally sane and even necessary to break the rules now and then. It’s good to see that you are giving those “louder” details a chance. Truth is that in typeface design you will find yourself throwing out most of your original ideas because either they look as mistakes or they convey a trying-to-hard impression :-/ Talking about high-contrast spots as design features I immediately had to think about Lexikon, which to me can be called a successful design without hesitation (&hellip;although I’ve always thought the /z/ looks off).</p>
<p>As to the spacing, stick to the rule of thumb of spacing glyphs that are closer to a vertical line looser and glyphs that are pointier tighter. Give vertical letters a side-bearing about half as wide as the average counter width. Of course, be consistent for the sake of it and to save precious time; otherwise your class based kerning is useless. These are all things you probably already know, but perhaps they confirm your own ideas about spacing.</p>

<p>I shortened the ear of /g but didn&rsquo;t compensate for the loss of black. I will make it thicker at the top so the top of /g doesn&rsquo;t look like an apple.</p>
<p>As for Lexicon&rsquo;s /z, I guess you don&rsquo;t like the bottom serif being so diagonal? It could be a tad heavier as well. What makes this typeface work generally though? The /t and /f seem so heavy while all letters with shoulders and bowls are quite light in the joins. I guess he uses a different stroke for each class of letters which results in a dynamic typeface rather than a consistent one with some off-features.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the feedback. I think you&rsquo;re right on all points. The /A is a little off to me, but I&rsquo;m actually thinking of shortening the left serif even more to remove that &ldquo;bump&rdquo;. I personally like the /A in Trinité and Lexicon a lot and think it might work well for this typeface. It&rsquo;s also for functional reasons; this probably isn&rsquo;t going to matter too much for the left side of /A, but considering its shape there will always be a lot of space around the letter so I want to compensate for that.</p>
<p>The apostrophe could be a bit lighter. I noticed Lexicon&rsquo;s is really big (but Lexicon is darker anyway) so I guess I leaned a bit too much to Lexicon&rsquo;s apostrophe.</p>
<p>Can you make a suggestion for c_u? Do you think I should make a contextual alternate to make the point where the terminal and serif meet less obtrusive?</p>
<p>I noticed I forgot to include /q in this sample. I made sure the bowls of b/d/p/q are all unique.</p>
<p>What do you think of /y now?
Should /e be a bit darker on the left, and should /s be a bit wider? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how much to differentiate in letter widths. I like the Venetian model regarding widths but it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to use that for this typeface, though I don&rsquo;t want all characters to be equal in width and provide the exact same rhythm either because I feel it would make the typeface more dull.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking of moving the terminal of /t a bit to the left. I almost feel the /t has a tendency to lean backwards so I might have to compensate for that. Moving the lower part a bit to the left might create more tension as well, which could be good.</p>
<p>I also shortened the serifs on the ascenders a bit so they will work better in combination with capital letters. With the long serifs there was just too much space between I_l and similar letter combinations.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The /cu/ pair might just need kerning. I don’t think moving them a tad apart would open a significant gap. If you do an alternate, the obvious fix would be to shrink the serif of /u/, but then you might better just shrink the serif of the /u/ glyph itself.</p>
<p>/y/ clearly improved. The terminal is too light to my eye but apart from that it looks OK.</p>
<p>I still see /e/ to light on the left side <em>or</em> at the top. Expanding the former is a better idea I think, as you suggested. Either way it does look thin next to /n/.</p>
<p>/s/ looks balanced to me now, but if you wish you can make it wider (just try not to make it wider than Palatino’s /s/ ;-).</p>
<p>I second your suggestion about the /t/.</p>
<p>Can we see the update of /b/d/p/q/ and the ascenders?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here&rsquo;s an update on Baran:
![](/images/old-images/Baran v17_4454.jpg)</p>
<p>I changed quite a few characters subtly, added /x, /B and /T, and lowered the height of the capital letters. Specifically have a look at /y. It&rsquo;s improved but I&rsquo;m still not happy with it. I&rsquo;m having a hard time with the transition from the stem to the terminal.</p>
<p>I darkened the /e quite a bit. I think it looks consistent now, though now I see it next to /a I feel like the /a might be a tad too light in the bowl and the terminal. I made the /s a little bit wider. The design of the comma and quotes has been adjusted to make it look like they&rsquo;re rotated a bit to the right. I also tried shortening the left serif of /A further but it looked odd, so I normalized the left serif. The left side of /A is too light I think. I forgot to update /z so I will do that next time.</p>
<p>The /u is quite problematic at times due to its long serifs. I will probably add some contextual alternates (for c_u among others) with a shorter left serif and I see an f_u ligature is probably a good idea. Any suggestions on how to make r_y less obtrusive?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like how the variations of the bowls of /b/d/p/q/ still look very related. Interesting counter shape; I didn’t notice it earlier.</p>
<p>The colon and semicolon have perhaps too much space in-between.</p>
<p>I don’t think the /ry/ pair needs anything more than just kerning.</p>
<p>/y/ is maybe a tad too light at the thin part of the terminal, but it looks OK. I also tend to take longer drawing the /y/. It’s the long diagonal that starts with a serif and ends in a terminal, with a thick-thin-thick transition. Ask yourself in which spot you want that transition to happen. Hope it helps.</p>
<p>The area around the left serif of /A/ is too light indeed. I still think the serifs (both) could be longer towards the center, as if pushed together. At least longer than the serifs of the lowercase. But it’s your call ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>The colon and semicolon have perhaps too much space in-between.</blockquote>
I thought so too, but how do I fix this? I can imagine it will look good if I bring the two dots of the colon closer together (thus taking them away from the baseline and the mean line), but raising the comma of the semicolon may be odd. To me it doesn't look wrong necessarily, but I don't think a floating comma is an elegant solution. How are the colon and semicolon usually balanced in typefaces with a high x-height? Also, how is this fixed in very light typefaces where the dots of the colon drift further apart? Am I wrong in thinking they should align with the baseline and mean line?
<p>![](/images/old-images/Baran v18 semicolon test_4336.jpg)</p>
<blockquote>Ask yourself in which spot you want that transition to happen.</blockquote>
Thanks for the tip, though I have been asking myself this continually. The problem I think is the join; I want to take a longer distance for the curve on the inside of the terminal, but it still needs to go straight after the join. The fact that the area above and below the join needs to align is rather restricting. It's a bit hard to explain, but essentially there are too many diagonals and curves to consider which makes it difficult to have a nice transition without bumps in the curves. I feel very restricted. Perhaps I should have cut the left side off temporarily so there are a fewer diagonals to consider. Anyway, I reworked the /y again and it's looking much better. I will upload a new version later once I've added more letters and made more revisions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I changed A, B, H, T, r, s, y and z and added O, S and Z. In the second image below /c and /e are changed as well, making the stress a bit more diagonal.

The second image makes me realize the apostrophe is still too heavy and the acute accent is too light. It&rsquo;s appropriate to make the diacritics a tad lighter though, isn&rsquo;t it? I often find diacritics to be a bit too obtrusive. I&rsquo;m wondering if I should make the hyphen more subtle as well.</p>
<p>Also, how do you usually space the apostrophe and how big should the side bearings be? I had to kern &lsquo;_s by an extreme amount so I figured I might have to reduce the side bearings, but I don&rsquo;t know if that will give problems in other areas. Is there usually a lot of kerning done for punctuation?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Space the apostrophe in a way that (i) without any kerning wouldn’t cause any ugly collisions and (ii) save you the most kerning work. In this case you space it relative to the ascenders (left and right) and kern the rest of the pairs. You will spend much less time kerning punctuation that sits on the baseline, as there is more symmetry at that height.</p>
<p>I like what you did with the /y/ shape-wise. The terminal (not the diagonal) could be thicker. You’re almost done :•)</p>
