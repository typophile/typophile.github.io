body: I feel that 10 years of almost exclusively computer-based writing have reduced
  what is left of my handwriting to an illegible and clumsy mess and quite frankly,
  I have had enough of it. I think I need to learn handwriting anew, from scratch,
  as it were, until I like what I see when I write by hand once again and until I
  (and of course everyone else) can decipher it as well.  Does anyone have links to
  websites and books on handwriting/calligraphy etc. that might be of use in my quest?

  body: Check out Dwiggins' handwriting, it's the most beautiful printing (not cursive)
    I've ever seen. If I were at home I'd post an image from WAD to RR, but I'm not
    and won't be for a week. Maybe someone else could help.

    point. Very nice capitals, if you ask me. \r\n\r\nI've done the same thing as
    you, btw. It's well worth to remember that this is very much a project that you
    can teach yourself without any instruction, if need be. Just sit down, rethink
    your letters, practice a lot and repeat.\r\n\r\nThe real problems come when trying
    to write your new handwriting quickly, something I haven't yet managed."

    am no longer the only person that can read my handwriting. Also, \r\njust taking
    a moment before I place pen to paper to remind myself that \r\nI can't write as
    fast as I type has made a vast improvement as well. "

  body: "There are many decent books on this subject and a few excellent ones too.\r\nI
    like The Italic Way to Beautiful Handwriting by Fred Eager because\r\nit has a
    solid italic model and a practical \"cursive\" mode as well.\r\nI'm guessing it's
    out of print but I've seen many used for a few\r\ndollars. Be sure to check in
    the Craft section of your local used\r\nbookstore as calligraphy (or writing in
    this case) usually falls into\r\nthis section. Again, there are many others including
    the classic stuff\r\nfrom Alfred Fairbank."

  body: "You're not alone! Talking to my brother last night--who has never had to
    write much of anything by hand--and he said he sometimes forgets how to make certain
    letters. Has to consciously stop and think, then continue writing. (He also can't
    spell because spell check always does it for him.) I was truly surprised, but
    I guess it's not that uncommon. If you don't use it you lose it...\r\n\r\nK.\r\n\r\n "

    note: Does anyone else have trouble distinguishing the text links in the posts
    here? I can barely tell the difference. They really need to be red, instead of
    the grayish blue they are now. Or, at least, underlined."
