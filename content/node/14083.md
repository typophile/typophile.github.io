  body: "Oops you are right, I had rejected VAG Rounded but that has the y and u that
    you are looking for, however, the a is single storey and the B and D don't match
    but looking at your scan again I wonder if the B and D (especially the D) had
    been condensed. The a looks out of step with the rest of the logo.\r\nTim"
