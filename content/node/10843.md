body: <B>SALT LAKE 2002 SIGNAGE &amp; MOTION GRAPHICS?</B> <BR> <BR>;i&#39;d like
  to know what typeface is being used for the nbc graphics for the 2002 winter olympics
  &#40;<A HREF="http://saltlake2002.com/" TARGET="_blank">salt lake 2002</A>&#41;,
  as well as the typefaces being used for the signage.  does anyone know what design
  firm did these?  &#40;nbc obviously being seperate&#41; <BR> <BR>;the main graphic
  for nbc displays characteristics similiar to rotis serif, but is obviously not.  i
  know it is not a proprietary face, because i&#39;ve seen it in coca-cola&#39;s ads
  as well. <BR> <BR>;i&#39;d also be interested in everyone&#39;s opinions of these
  graphics and the typography in general. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/809.gif"

  body: ' The font is Frutiger, or Myriad, or another one of those generics. The other
    font is probably ITC&#39;s plagiarism of Rotis - I forget the name. The icons
    I think suck. <BR> <BR>BTW, I love the Winter Olympics, but it&#39;s so great
    living in America and not being able to watch it live... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' i dont like the icons either. i could have made better ones with popsicle
    sticks. and when the anchor talks about the event they have the icons extruded
    in 3d and they rotate- for no reason. i think they were trying to mimic some 3d
    stuff ive seen on Xgames graphics, i dont know. '

    Which event&#40;s&#41;? If you tell me the Women&#39;s Downhill, I&#39;m not talking
    to you any more. <BR> <BR>&#62; i think they were trying to mimic some 3d stuff
    ive seen on Xgames graphics <BR> <BR>That makes sense. There&#39;s an overall
    effort to make the Winter Games appeal to a younger audience &#40;which is the
    reason for the reintroduction of Skeleton, a very regressive sport&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>{Now, how the hell do I get this back on topic?...} <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ';so, the salt lake 2002 graphics seem to be using <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/FRUT/F_FRUT-10067000.html"
    TARGET="_blank">frutiger</A>, but no one&#39;s mentioned the typeface nbc&#39;s
    using yet --that&#39;s the one i&#39;m most interested in. <BR> <BR>;i agree with
    the general sentiment that the graphics really stink.  a lot.  i thought of popsicle
    sticks the first time i saw them, too: <I>i wanted something to gag myself with</I>.  the
    extruded/beveled versions made me laugh the first time i saw one spinning next
    to bob costas&#39; head. <BR> <BR>;off type, i am fortunate to live right on the
    border of canada, here in metro detroit.  we watch most events on <A HREF="http://cbc.ca/olympics/"
    TARGET="_blank">cbc</A>, so we&#39;re not tied to the <A HREF="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20020209/ap_on_sp_ol/oly_screen_plays_1"
    TARGET="_blank">taped coverage</A> that nbc is dishing out.  <BR> <BR>;cRaig'
