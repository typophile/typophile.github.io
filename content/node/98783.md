body: "Hi Everybody\r\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t find an intro thread so here goes...\r\n\r\nI
  saw some interesting topics on this forum (like the \u201Cbusiness card\u201D thread)
  and liked the \u201Cfeel\u201D of it - not the usual bickering as on some forums.
  Also quite a few members here seem to be \u201Cold school\u201D which also interests
  me :)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a semi-retired printer (letterpress and litho) based near
  Leeds, UK.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had a long term interest in typography - starting in
  1964 as an apprentice compositor (typesetter) with a small family letterpress firm
  and starting my own little litho and letterpress business in 1977. This business
  is now run by my son and I\u2019m just in the background - although I still enjoy
  using the old methods and like to produce the occasional short run bespoke business
  cards myself in letterpress foil on a small hand machine.\r\n\r\nI found the resurgence
  of demand for letterpress very interesting - and a little surprising - the letterpress
  Christmas cards offered by Steve Jobs had a lot to do with my own renewed interest
  and also the general resurgence in demand for letterpress, I think - anyway that\u2019s
  about it :)\r\n\r\n- David"

    (which you could customize with iPhoto and then order) only a few years ago (2010
    maybe) and there was already a renewed interest is letterpress at that point,
    at least among designers, but Apple's offering may have increased public awareness
    and interest in it."

    to be a dying breed. I was fortunate enough, during my working career, to see
    hand compositors and Linotype operators in action, and wss in awe of their skills
    and expertise. It's refreshing to find practitioners of the Arcane Printing Arts--wizards
    in a way, really--still going strong..."

    and letterpress, and the skill of the operators was indeed impressive.

    mean I see no place for things like letterpress in the present and future. In
    fact my own \"high-grade\" card* I printed myself (on a rented press sadly):\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4121700633\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4121695105\r\n\r\n*
    I also have a Vistaprint one for people who don't know the difference.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    plates. I own a C&P Pilot and use a Vandercook at school. I've done some Linotype
    typefounding at the Bixler foundry too.\r\n\r\nIt's really great to have another
    letterpress person on here.\r\n\r\nHere's a project I'm working on now that involves
    a bit of letterpress:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/98708"

    have a drill press just taunting me ... and I have a laser cutter that will cut
    into most anything. I figure together I should be able to come close enough :)\r\n\r\nn."

  body: "Hi guys - Many thanks for the lovely welcome...\r\n\r\nJamesM - no doubt
    you're right - I just wasn't aware :)\r\n\r\noldnick - very nice to meet you -
    a wizard eh - made me laugh :)\r\n\r\nhrant - yes that's the answer, expensive
    cards for those who matter and cheapos for the rest :)\r\n\r\nJoshua - I guess
    a C&P Pilot is similar to an Arab Platen? - I pedalled many a mile on an Arab
    as a new apprentice before being allowed into the composing room :)\r\n\r\n5star
    - good to meet you - can you please tell me what's a 'drill press' ?\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes to all - David\r\n"

  body: "So I had to Google \"Arab Platen\" \u2014 it looks like a flywheel operated
    platen press, similar to most C&Ps. The Pilot, on the other hand, is a table top
    platen press, operated with a lever. It was designed for high schools, more as
    a tool to explain and practice the basics of letterpress than for any real job
    work. It's a lot more difficult to injure yourself with than a flywheel press.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, do you know about www.briarpress.org? It's a great letterpress resource."
