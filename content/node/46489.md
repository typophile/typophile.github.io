body: "I collected this handsome art deco face in a cemetery in deep southeastern
  Poland.  It is clearly similar to URW Casablanca and Font Bureau Romeo, both descended
  from FT Nacional Electra, but the \"A\" is different than any of the three since
  its crossbar extends beyond the diagonals on both sides.\r\n\r\nAny idea?  My Fonts'
  What The Font guessed:\r\n-   Casablanca URW T Med Cond\r\n-   Generica Cond Med\r\n-
  \  Earthman BB Bold\r\n-   20th Century Med Cond\r\n-   Fago Co Reg - Roman\r\nbut
  none of them had the distinct \"A\".\r\n\r\nDaveFW\r\n\r\nTwo samples:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/polishcem_5811.jpg]"
