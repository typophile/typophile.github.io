body: "Heya,\r\n\r\nThis project was my first venture into type design, inspired by
  the old badge faces from big american cars in the 50's and 60's.  \r\n\r\nIt started
  as a true-type font using fontlab's 'typetool' (thats all we had 2 years ago when
  i was at university).  I would like to rework it as open type.\r\n\r\nAny criticisms,
  advice, direction or feedback would be muchly appreciated.\r\n\r\nLooking at it
  now, I think the following are a bit odd...\r\n\r\n- Upper case 'N' just aint right\r\n-
  In fact, I think all the uppercase glyphs are a bit incoherent\r\n- Something probably
  needs to happen with lowercase 'f'\r\n- Stroke width probably could be a bit thicker

  body: I think the huge eccentricity of the capitals is what makes this face awesome.
    I agree, though, that the 'N' isn't right. And the left curve of the 'A' is too
    organic; it should terminate at the same angle as everything else. I might dare
    to say 'Z' is not weird enough! Try other things for the 'O', too, because it
    could read as a big 'a'. As odd as it sounds, maybe a perfect circle would work.

  body: speaking as a type-loving graphic designer, not a type designer, i think this
    face is a great candidate for lots of alternate characters. Allow the final user
    to choose from a pallete of characters to achieve the optimal rhythm. Some alternate
    begining/ending characters would be cool.
