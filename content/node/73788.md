  a logo for my photography web site (currently being re-vamped).  I am a London-based
  photographer and am looking for a logo inspired by old-fashioned camera manufacturers.
  \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in talking further, please get in touch, giving me
  an idea of your rates for this type of work, and an indication of when you would
  be able to work on this.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\nWill\r\n\r\n"

    a logo inspired by old-fashioned \r\n> camera manufacturers.\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic
    designer and I'd suggest that when working with whoever you hire, you suggest
    that as one possible direction but also let the designer know that you're open
    to considering other approaches, too. I've found over the years that the logo
    a client likes best is often totally different than what they had initially expected.\r\n\r\nA
    retro look based on old camera manufacturers, as you suggested, might work, but
    on the other hand your work has a contemporary look to me, and I imagine you use
    modern equipment, so you'd need to be careful that your logo didn't create the
    wrong impression.\r\n\r\nSince \"panoramic photographer\" is mentioned prominently
    on your home page, a logo design with panoramic aspects is an approach I'd suggest
    considering. Perhaps a business card with panoramic proportions, too."

  body: "Hi James\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply.  I totally agree and am definitely
    open to suggestions.  I suppose what I was looking for was something really simple,
    just clean typography. \r\n\r\nRunning searches trying to identify the vimeo font
    is what bought me to typofile.  I read a thread in the critique forum and thought
    IanCrombie summed up the requirements beautifully - http://typophile.com/node/72420\r\n\r\n\"Inspired
    by the script identities of Leitz / Leica and other bygone camera manufacturers,
    I took the approach of combining a friendly script with mechanical germanic flair.
    As a photographer both relies on his personality and his technical skill to create
    images this dichotomy made sense to me.\"\r\n\r\nI love Ian's final design and
    typography, but recognise that I'll need something different that fits with my
    work / site.\r\n\r\nThe panoramic business cards idea is also definitely worth
    considering - thanks for that!\r\n\r\n"

    other way round, too. Personally I find this equally refreshing to say the least:
    the *designer* ends up on a path where he didn\u2019t expect to get to initially.
    \r\nI just made this experience (again) with the brand design for a small music
    CD label:\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tal_1-2_3514.jpg]\r\n.\r\nTop
    left is what I suggested first: something clear and strong. Then the client explained
    in more detail the mood he wanted to evoke. During the conversation I did a tiny
    scribble (bottom left). Then I scanned the scribble, did some image editing and
    proposed what is on the right side. \u2013 Amazing or not: that was accepted as
    fitting perfectly \u2026  ;-)\r\n\r\nAlas, Will, splendid photographs! I\u2019d
    apply.\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nIt's important for the designer and client to go through the design process
    with an open mind.  You look objectively at the situation and goals, you do research,
    you come up with concepts, you critique and modify them (sometimes repeatedly),
    etc. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the process, it may turn out that the designer's initial
    idea -- or the client's initial idea -- turns out to be the right solution. But
    sometimes the process takes you to a solution that neither of you expected. "
