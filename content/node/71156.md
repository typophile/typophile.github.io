  body: This came up once a few years ago. It's an old film font from Headliners International
    called neo-Somerset. Don't think it's ever been digitized. Joe Treacy (Treacyfaces)
    probably owns whatever rights there are on it (he acquired the Headliners library
    years ago and has digitized some of the fonts).
