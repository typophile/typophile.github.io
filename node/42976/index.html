  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,
who else is working on getting fluent, natural looking connections? 
I have not really found very many good examples.</p>
<p>I am trying to solve the problem with:</p>
<p>a)
many ligatures</p>
<p>b)
creating alternates for the following kind of connections:
&ldquo;high&rdquo;(example: o n), 
&ldquo;medium&rdquo; (example: n n), 
&ldquo;low&rdquo;(example: y n),
&ldquo;no&rdquo; (example: any pair disconnected on purpose)</p>
<p>It works quite well (with some flaws).
I would like to go a bit into detail on this with someone else working on the problem.</p>
<p>js</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just completed an antique handwriting font that is connecting. Its always tough making some connections work, though probably easier on letters that are textural. The one I&rsquo;m currently working on is based on smooth pointed brush lettering.  Many letters vary in size and so making all the connections line up and look natural is more difficult. Letters that connect towards the top are the most difficult and often benefit from ligatures as you said.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve also tried is putting connectors on the left side of some letters and creating a version without these for beginnings and next to letters that don&rsquo;t connect. If you want the letters to look more close to a natural flow of writing, its good to make places that purposely don&rsquo;t connect. In handwriting there are always places where the writer lifts the pen. It helps visually to break up the connecting pattern a bit. Open type feature code is great for getting this all to work. I will see if I can post an image.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Your example is very nice. I agree that there should be places which purposely are not connected. 
But it&rsquo;s hard to create the right dosage - so these work well in different kinds of texts and in different languages. Here is an example of what we are working on - sample text in English and Spanish&hellip;(some other languages we tested are a bit more problematic).
Could you comment?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Monoline handwriting does present some challenges. I think most of your connections are working smoothly. I like the loose quality of it. There are some things that could be done to improve its legibility— depending on how well you want it to read. 
I&rsquo;ll make some observations, but since I don&rsquo;t know the background on the font&rsquo;s development or how you see it being used, these may not all be relevant.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;o&rdquo; that is looped &ldquo;antropogénica&rdquo; seems less natural as might be written. It does read ok in that combination. Since I don&rsquo;t read Spanish the other one I wasn&rsquo;t sure was an &ldquo;o&rdquo; or an &ldquo;s&rdquo; with a loop (especula?).</p>
<p>Some of the connections come out a bit flat at the bottom, but at small sizes its not a big issue.</p>
<p>In general, I like the look and feel of the lettering a lot, but think some simplification might improve it both in looks and legibility.</p>
<p>The cap &ldquo;I&rdquo; connection seems like it might be confusing in some combinations.</p>
<p>The long heavy crosses on many of the lowercase t&rsquo;s seem isolated and catch my eye too much.</p>
<p>I love the simpler letters like the basis  s i e n h, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;p&rdquo; as in &ldquo;pounds&rdquo; has a right bowl to similar to an &ldquo;n&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I also think the start loop on lowercase &ldquo;c&quot;s might be a bit over done. In some places it can read like an &ldquo;e&rdquo;. It seems rhythmically out of character a bit too.</p>
<p>Some of the lowercase &ldquo;d&quot;s are so seperated from the ascending stroke that you might have situations where it reads as cl.</p>
<p>I know that seems like a lot of comments, but even so, I think your design will be a lovely and useful font.
Hope this is helpful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>and thanks for remarks, they  give a lot to think about. 
A few words about the font: It&rsquo;s inspired by Kafka&rsquo;s handwriting which is extremely rich in its variation of forms &hellip; you seem to be able to recognize the moods he was in when writing. The most &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; forms like in the c, d, p, t and some of the strange connections between caps and following characters are authentically Kafka, and, although they hamper legibility, we find it important to keep them, because they add so much to the overall feeling. 
Now we are thinking of adding a second style focussing more on readability and consistency of form, and there your comments will be very helpful.
You are surely right that some of the connections on the &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; are too flat &hellip; we have to do something there too.</p>
<p>Thanks again.
Jurgen</p>
