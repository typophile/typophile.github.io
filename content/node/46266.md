  \r\nI\u2019ve decided to establish a running feature on my blog that I will call
  \u201CTypography Photography\u201D. This is kind of like the previous posts about
  found type photos I have done (see the links at the bottom of the post), but from
  now on I will try to write a little about each picture instead of just posting them.\r\n
  \r\nTo see the rest of the images, and read my thoughts on them, please visit the
  post on my personal blog:\r\n \r\n[[http://gentlepurespace.com/blog/archives/typography-photography-3|Typography
  Photography Vol. 3, 10 more great photos of found type]]\r\n \r\nPrevious versions:

    images like these!
