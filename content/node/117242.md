body: I love this type next to the illustrations. its seemingly a bit condensed and
  clean. I want to do some mockups so something close is fine. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/68-Goody-Catalog-pg34_6698.jpg]

  body: looking for the text for glamour bows and fashion bows. I have the entire
    catalog scanned at this low quality with no access to the original. sorry for
    the quality.

  body: "Given the lack of detail in your image, to my eye the closest available digital
    font is Vonnes Light Compressed [img:sites/default/files/old-images/VonnesLightCompressed
    InUse_5845.jpg] http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness/\r\nDavid Berlow designed
    Vonness based on Bauer\u2019s Venus of 1907-10 and expanded it to 56 fonts.\r\nThis
    weight existed as a metal font under the name Venus Light Condensed.\r\nI don't
    know if it is possible to purchase a single font.\r\nAs for your 1968 font all
    I can observe is that this was the era of photo lettering and fonts for advertising
    and packaging were aften the result of considerable changes in width, height and
    weight.\r\nDon\r\np.s. I am not really certain whether this is the compressed
    or condensed, but this specimen shows the narrower of the two."
