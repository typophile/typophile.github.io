  know something important.\r\n?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gayke2_4639.jpg]\r\nI
  thought the hand lettering on the note (which matches the iced message) was unique,
  or maybe it resembles a font, or maybe it should be a font! It's kind of a unicase
  with no descenders. What do you think?\r\n"
