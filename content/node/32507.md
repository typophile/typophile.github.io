  the initial text frame, everything looks fantastic...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_5210.png]\r\n\r\nWhen
  I flow text into a second frame, the body text loses it's vertical alignment to
  the baseline grid...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b_4485.png]\r\n\r\nFunny
  thing is, when I create a headline at the beginning of the second frame, things
  line up again...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/c_6532.png]\r\n\r\nHelp!
  Any clues to avoid the shift in vertical alignment?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n--new2me"

  body: "In the paragraph style for the body text, make sure to select the option
    'Align to Baseline Grid' (must be set to 'first line only' or 'align all lines').\r\n\r\nMake
    sure to set the leading to the same amount as the baseline grid spacing. You can
    experiment with this is you wish to use a leading of 1/3 as well obviously, or
    any fraction. Just make sure to at least align the first line."

  body: A thousand thanks vincentg--I'd never used the 'Align to Baseline Grid' feature.
    I've always shifted the baseline (-) to achieve the same effect. :)
