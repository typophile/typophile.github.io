body: This is a badge on the back of my car... I&#39;ve seen a few similarities with
  other fonts, nothing exceptionally close though... &#40;Autotechnica for one&#41;...
  it&#39;s on the back of many GM cars in Australia, ranging from 1987-1997 &#40;possibly
  later&#41;, I&#39;ve seen about 6 different models, all with the same lettering...
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m hoping it wasn&#39;t made exclusively for them, but god knows...
  here is the image... any help would be greatly appreciated, <BR> <BR><center> <BR>

  body: Auto makers have always had people in-house who design the nameplates. They
    are sometimes based on fonts, but more often, they are custom-designed. That said,
    there may well be a font that looks something like this, but I think it&#39;s
    unlikely that they used a font to create this particular nameplate.

  body: Thanks for the post. I was dreading that it was a custom creation, but if
    anyone could give suggestions on a similar design, I&#39;d be more than greatful.
    <BR> <BR>there are about 6-7 models of car, with this lettering on each, so i
    guess it could come down to scanning the badges, and creating a font out of it.
    while I don&#39;t have access to all of the letters, I have most, so i guess it&#39;s
    better than nothing. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Glen.
