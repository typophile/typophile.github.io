    least the EPS file had a preview.  It could&#39;ve been completely blank...

  body: I don&#39;t see the problem.  <BR> <BR>That lowercase &#39;i&#39; looks just
    fine. <BR> <BR>Actually, has anyone actually experienced this in their own work
    where an .eps was actually present? <BR> <BR>Or, in the .pdf environment? <BR>
    <BR>Are there technical &#40;non-gremlin&#41; reasons why a vector outline might
    not be &#39;noticed&#39; by a rip even though it&#39;s right where it ought to
    be, and named so? <BR> <BR>I hadn&#39;t really delved into this for several years,
    and a long as this glitch brings it to mind, I&#39;m curious. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR>

    only thing I can think of is that the EPS was  <BR>moved in of out of a subfolder
    so the original  <BR>link thread is modified. So the EPSF is present  <BR>BUT
    not in the location where the RIP is supposed  <BR>to find it.
