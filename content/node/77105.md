  body: Now this is a logo I'd want to see on my car. Bells, this is the <em>look</em>
    I'd want to see on my car! But a face that goes with the logo without looking
    like garish go-faster stripes... is that even possible?

  body: "I can see two things:\r\n\r\n1. Two or three lines in a fat, wide sans under
    the T, but the logo already looks like it's moving at a cop-scaring clip to the
    right.\r\n\r\n2. One line in a tyre-track face, like Rich Gast's Eagle GT II underneath
    the logo."

    the Wide width of the current Typophile featured face, <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Condor/\">Condor</a>,
    looks like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TAD-CondorWide_4593.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOr,

  body: I go with a rock solid sans. Like Alright Sans, Sense, or the like - but bolder
    and all caps. At least as a starting point.
