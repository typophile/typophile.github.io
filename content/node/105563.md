  body: "There were very few swash fonts in use in the 1940s when the label was designed.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LondonRecords_3467.jpg]\r\nI
    venture that the logotype LONDON is precise lettering, inspired by the Caslon
    Swash fonts then available. See for example the ATF catalog of 1934:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF1934p66Caslon471SwashSM_4723.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF1934p66Caslon540SwashSM_3538.jpg]\r\nDon"
