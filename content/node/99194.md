  body: "It depends on which letters you need to make \u201Ccome together\u201D with
    your logotype.\r\nThere are mid-weight script typefaces which may be close but
    you\u2019ll have to add any eventual interlocking by redrawing parts of them,
    so I\u2019m not sure using a typeface is the best solution.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could
    start from something like this: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/gelato-script/
    or this http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/fancier-script/ but not sure it\u2019s
    the best way to go: if you need to produce a similar logo, you have to draw it
    freehand."
