  body: "Mandarin is the standard form of *spoken* Chinese in Beijing and is the most
    standard/common dialect in mainland China. For *written* Chinese, instead of \"Mandarin\"
    you should specify \"Simplified Chinese\" (for mainland China today) or \"Traditional
    Chinese\" (for Taiwan and pre-Communist diaspora). Simplified Chinese is used
    across China, even in all those parts of the country where Mandarin is not spoken.\r\n\r\nTrying
    to make sense of your second sentence, would it be more clear to say you want
    a typeface that is NOT the Times of Simplified Chinese? In that case, you should
    avoid system fonts such as these:\r\nhttp://www.pinyinjoe.com/pinyin/pinyin_xpfonts.htm\r\nhttp://www.pinyinjoe.com/windows-7/win7-chinese-intro.htm#fonts\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_Mac_OS_X\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the clarification Thomas! And to add clarity, I've attached a
    roman face that I'd like to find as much of an equivalent as possible.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goatmilk_6177.gif]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is one from the page Jabez linked that seems close! Looking to license something
    and this file doesn't seem very usable (on a mac, at least).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/china_5014.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
    other thoughts?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Your current choice looks a goot fit. However, I want to mind you it is \"yet
    another bold Hei(=sans-serif) font\" and may or may not be too common.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I remember, there are not many bold sans Simplified Chinese fonts shipped
    with OSes anyway. Check Microsoft Yahei-Bold(from Windows) and Hiragino Sans GB
    W6(from MacOSX) to see if your choice is too \"common\".\r\n\r\nAnd, here are
    some more foundries to look at:\r\nhttp://www.foundertype.com/\r\nhttp://www.arphic.com/\r\n\r\nFinally,
    for \u6C49\u9F0E fonts, I (as a native Chinese) googled a few times but failed
    to find the official website... So be ware."
