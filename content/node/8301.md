body: When I worked for a film magazine, I used to receive artwork from film distributors
  and one of the fonts i got was a movie poster credit font that had dings that were
  job titles i.e. if you pressed option k then the job title &#39;film editor&#39;
  would pop up with the word &#39;film&#39; stacked on top of the word &#39;editor&#39;.
  Does anyone know what font that is? I&#39;ve attached an example. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56427.jpg"

  body: The font is Univers Light &#40;or maybe Thin&#41; Ultra Condensed - you may
    already know that - but I don&#39;t know about those special characters. Did you
    try googling it? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/38604.html?1101045556"
