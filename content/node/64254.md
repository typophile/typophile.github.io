body: "as typophiles we want to make our websites with the best types, and recently
  I figured out something that couldn't find documented on the web -I think- and want
  to share this\u2026 if you want your visitors view your site in a specific type,
  you can use font stacks, ej this is a traditional Garamond-based serif stack:\r\n\r\nfont-family:
  \"Palatino Linotype\", Palatino, Palladio, \"URW Palladio L\", \"Book Antiqua\",
  Baskerville, \"Bookman Old Style\", \"Bitstream Charter\", \"Nimbus Roman No9 L\",
  Garamond, \"Apple Garamond\", \"ITC Garamond Narrow\", \"New Century Schoolbook\",
  \"Century Schoolbook\", \"Century Schoolbook L\", Georgia, serif;\r\n\r\nthe browser
  checks for every font, and displays the website with the first font installed on
  the visitor's p.c.\r\nthe problem is to figure out the name for non-webstandard
  typefaces like Avant Garde Gothic, so my first try was:\r\n\r\nfont-family: \"ITC
  Avant Garde Gothic Std Book\";\r\n\r\nthat was exactly the name I see on my fontexplorer,
  but does not work :(, finally my last try \u2013and the most unlikely for me to
  work\u2013 was this:\r\n\r\nfont-family: \"ITCAvantGardeStd-Bk\";\r\n\r\nAnd it
  worked!!! the name we should use is the PostScript name of our preferred typeface.
  I know this could be useless for most of the users that don't have the Avant Garde,
  but I wanted to give a better look  of my website for those who does.\r\n\r\nFinally,
  hope this could be helpful to further references :)"

    L\u201D, Georgia, serif;</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is not really useful. While the Windows
    system version of Palatino (Palatino Linotype) is well hinted, the other names
    may refer to either TrueType versions of Palatino, that are not well hinted, or
    to PostScript versions, that can\u2019t be hinted as well as TrueType versions.
    So it may be better for the user, to refer to fonts, that are legible on screen,
    at least in case of body text.\r\n\r\n(Maybe it would be better to embed \"Palatino
    Linotype\", although I doubt, that this is allowed. And I don\u2019t know, how
    well it is rendered on the Mac.)\r\n\r\nAnd even if the user has ITC Avant Garde,
    it does not mean, that he has installed it.\r\n\r\nYou probably know the <em><a
    href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com\">CSS Zen Garden</a></em>. <strong>(Admins,
    change the color of links, please. They are almost not visible.)</strong> The
    expression does not primary come from the fonts. Many of the designs are not optimized
    for legibility. (Many of them seem to be made by graphic designers, but not by
    typographers.) I want to say, that an \"Avant Garde feeling\" does not necessarily
    require the presence of the font Avant Garde on all pages of the website. For
    a logo, an image replacement-technique may be the better choice (in a barrier
    free way)."

    also than windows raster engine is really bad, I just wanted to point out that
    we have to refer to the PostScript name at font-family property\r\n\r\nfinally,
    I'm not saying will use an \u201CAvant Garde feeling\u201D all over my website,

    us, but take heart.\r\nFWIW - in Windows, at least, Maintype quite conveniently
    shows me the font-family names, as long as the fonts are installed in the OS or
    in Maintype's backup folder. I would imagine any font management tool does the
    same.\r\nOn the free and simple side of the street, there is also, in Windows,
    the Font Properties Extension available for download.\r\nOnce installed, a right
    click on the font gives you lot of basic but useful info like names.\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx\r\n\r\nDon't
    know what the common equivalents to these might be on the Mac.\r\n"
