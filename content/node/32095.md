  Just found it in a book by Erik Spiekermann. It says there that it was created in
  1972. It sure looks like the grandpa of all what Spiekermann became famous for (Officina,
  Meta, Unit).\r\n\r\nMyFonts doesn't even list Salden as a designer. "

  body: "I just heard a lecture of Georg Salden two weeks ago at the \"forum typografie\",
    and he also talked about Polo. from what he (and Luc de Groot) said, I concluded
    that there seems to be\u2026 well\u2026 a disagreement concerning the originality
    of Meta.\r\n \r\nBut, as i said, that's all just by hearsay.\r\n\r\nSalden is
    nowadays selling typefaces via <a href=\"www.typemanufactur.com\">www.typemanufactur.com</a>.
    There are only a few of them available there, I think he designed dozens more.
    Very nice guy, by the way."

    body: "Yeah, I read about that disagreement somewhere.\r\nFrom what I read in
      that book by Spiekermann I mentioned (published 1989) I conclude that he sure
      was a big fan of Salden.\r\nIn fact the whole book is set in Polo.\r\nI did
      find the website too.\r\nI was just wondering if anybody ever used the font.\r\n"

    typefaces.
