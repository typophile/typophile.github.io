body: I was browsing through a Print annual at a friend&#39;s a while ago and came
  across a beautiful family of monoline blackletters that strongly resembled PhrackSle,
  only with a greater variety of weights &#40;I believe four or five&#41;. Of course,
  I promptly forgot the name of the font and the foundry &#40;only remembering that
  their web site&#39;s URL was irritatingly generic&#41;, and would now very much
  like to find the family again. I believe it&#39;s new in the last couple of years,
  and as I recall the family was expensive enough to keep me from buying it on the
  spot, even though I wanted to.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/phracksle/"

  this ring any bells with anyone?

  body: you might try the Type ID boards, they can ususally help with this kind of
    question.

  body: Thanks, Paul. Since I didn&#39;t have a specimen I wasn&#39;t sure the type
    ID forums were the correct place to post, but I&#39;ll give them a shot now.
