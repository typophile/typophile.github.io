  body: "I think this is a Caslon, and to me Berthold's Caslon Adbold looks very close.
    The single-serif C and T serifs that don't flare at the top, and the straight-legged
    R all fit this typeface. (I have this shown in the old 1998 FontBook, but I can't
    find it on any web site. Given the age of your sample, I think Caslon is a likely
    answer. I think it was quite popular during the age of photolettering.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: It's Caslon Bold Condensed, an old ATF face. Currently, the only digital version
    I know of is <a http://http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-caslon/">Caslon
    FB Bold Condensed</a>. Add the outline effect and it should match nearly perfectly.
