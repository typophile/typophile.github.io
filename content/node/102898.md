  body: "Presumably British voge is \"vogue.\" First thought was a HF&FJ Didot --
    very popular for fashion adverts -- but the R in LETTERS is like Perpetua. Same
    problem when I tried Century Old Style. Presumably one of our gurus recognizes
    the font.\r\nDon"

    differ even on Linotype's site and link.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snap_5567.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.linotype.com/1082965/Caslon540StdRoman-product.html|Caslon

  body: "Good match, except for the beaks at the end of the arms on T.\r\nI checked
    my copy of the font & it does not include this T as an alternate. Nor is it in
    the ATF design [I checked the 1923 specimen book] on which the digital font is
    based. Perhaps this is a Caslon 540 modified by the designer to get a slick effect?
