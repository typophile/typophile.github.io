  etc. [think Steven Heller&#39;s new book]&#41;.  Also helpful would be resources

  body: 'I guess it&#39;s a multi-faceted thing to say and consider. He was referring
    to the importance of consistency. But I see a problem with that on two levels:
    <BR>-Structural: I don&#39;t know any calligrapher who thinks that all letters
    should be structured the same. My teacher himself adds swashes, variant forms
    and whatnot. And quite ironically, with OpenType especially <i>fonts</i> are increasingly
    adopting variant forms... <BR>-Finish: This could make more sense, but I actually
    don&#39;t think it does either. If I want consistency, I <i>will</i> use a font.
    In this age, assuming you think calligraphy is useful &#40;and I for one think
    it is&#41;, the point should be celebrating the fauve, inconsistent aspect. On
    the other hand I don&#39;t think one should intentionally go crazy with inconsistency.
    So for myself I&#39;ve sort of arrived at this compromise: to try to make my letters
    consistent, but withouth using guides of any kind; and to not obsess about extender
    length for example; etc. I&#39;m still working on getting comfortable with this
    though. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Having been a calligraphy instructor for over 25 years myself &#40;amoung
    several other lettering arts pursuits&#41;. Consistency is the key to calligraphy.
    There are different kinds of consistency. Their are the classic forms of calligraphy,
    then there are the more modern forms of expressive calligraphy. Which type of
    consistency one strives for depends on what form of calligraphy you are creating.
    <BR> <BR>Most people erroneously refer to calligraphic and lettering work as &#34;fonts&#34;
    for the simple reason that it is the only term they are familiar with. The average
    individual knows nothing about the &#34;arcane art&#34; of letterforms, their
    use, history or creation. Even the majority of professional art directors who
    should know better.

  body: 'Don, I actually wasn&#39;t trying to be inventive there - for a change! :-&#41;
    That&#39;s my literal rendering of the hand we learned in class &#40;called &#34;Italic&#34;
    by the instructor&#41;, with some minor variations &#40;like the &#34;7&#34;,
    which I made less frail&#41; - but also that &#34;alternate&#34; binocular &#34;g&#34;.
    Even that swash &#34;A&#34; was one of the forms prescribed in class. &#40;The
    one &#34;structural&#34; thing I regret btw  is not giving the &#34;M&#34; a swash
    on its bottom-right.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; what inspired you to pursue calligraphy,
    and what do you hope to gain from it? <BR> <BR>Well, unless you&#39;ve been lurking
    here for a while, you might not know that I&#39;m actually firmly opposed to chirographic&#42;
    type; although I do think it can look beautiful&#42;&#42; sometimes, I also think
    it is regressive all of the time. I equate it with celebrating the past at the
    expense of building the future; but I guess everybody needs to party sometimes.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; A nicely focused term I got from John. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Ex Ponto
    is one of the very few fonts I&#39;ve ever bought. <BR> <BR>But no matter what
    I think of chirographic type, I&#39;m all for <i>learning</i> - I&#39;d like to
    be able to [better] grasp the chirographic observations people make when discussing
    type, something not uncommon. I&#39;ll be teaching a type design class at ArtCenter
    starting in May, and this makes me just that little bit more prepared. &#40;I&#39;ve
    also done some letterpress, and I learned a <i>lot</i> from that.&#41; <BR> <BR>Plus
    it&#39;s nice to be able to write well - people like that. I mail out things often,
    and I wouldn&#39;t mind some more flair but also discipline in the addresses and
    short notes that I write. To this end I plan on formulating my own &#34;hand&#34;
    - and I already know it will have a Carolingian lc &#34;a&#34;; and quite a sinister
    &#34;g&#34;. <BR> <BR>But I have to tell you, my first choice was Mandarin Chinese.
    I would have taken that class instead, except that instructor had a lisp - can
    you believe that?! <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; That&#39;s both cool and sad at
    the same time. <BR> <BR>Nicely expressed. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; I would take
    that to refer to finish <BR> <BR>Yes, but it&#39;s still a bit paradoxical. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; one should master the controlled before trying to master freedom <BR>
    <BR>I think there are pros and cons to both strategies, and some irreversible
    repercussions. Like it might in fact be [even] harder to master freedom once you&#39;ve
    mastered control... There&#39;s something to be said for jumping right in, something
    there&#39;s no other way to attain. In fact that&#39;s another reason I dumped
    the Mandarin class: it didn&#39;t feel right; I&#39;d really much prefer learning
    it on the streets of Shanghai or something. It seem to me there&#39;s something
    essentially wrong with formal education of natural language. But often it&#39;s
    all we have. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    <BR> <BR>No poblem Hrant, I didn&#39;t think you were. On the other hand, I do
    lamenting the fact that most graphic art &#34;professionals&#34; don&#39;t know
    the difference. Even if she had an editor, most editors wouldn&#39;t know the
    difference either. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s true, one of the most popular segments of
    type design today seems to be creating fonts that can be used to fake writing
    done by hand. Myself, I make a distinction between &#34;calligraphic fonts&#34;
    and informal &#34;handwriting/hand-printed&#34; fonts. Myself, I applaud the professional
    designs of fonts like Zapfino &#40;pretty, but limited in its uses&#41; and Bickham
    Script &#40;well done, but not representative of George Bickham&#39;s work&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>As an artist, I find it hard to get excited about most &#34;handwriting/hand-printed&#34;
    fonts. Probably because I can produce these whenever I want for myself &#40;though
    I know this isn&#39;t the case for everyone so they have a place too&#41;. But
    another reason I&#39;m not fond of this genre of font design is probably because
    I think you&#39;re right. The direct mail industry, no doubt, drives the &#34;handwriting/hand-printed&#34;
    craze. principally used to dupe people into thinking they&#39;ve received something
    with a personal touch &#40;for a change&#41;. I find such disingenuous creations
    to have a dark spirit'

  body: 'I think if one wants to &#39;jump right in&#39; to informal calligraphy &#40;as
    distinct from formal calligraphy of the kind that usually begins by learning a
    particular hand&#41;, it is best to avoid letterforms entirely for the first while,
    and simply explore the range of marks that can be made with the writing implements.
    I have a book by a German calligrapher that demonstrates this teaching technique:
    his students begin with abstract mark making. Calligraphic ideas of balance, harmony,
    stress, etc. are all clearly in evidence, but divorced from letterforms. Only
    in the second phase of the teaching do student progress to working with actual
    letters.'

    AIGA in NYC some time ago, it was awesome. It showcased some wonderful mexican
    wrestling posters that where printed on these huge man made presses. <BR>    What
    was so fascinating was that the letters where cut out from uncommon materials
    like linoleum tiles, carpeting, old rugs, cardboard, cloth, ect; basically, anything
    that would hold ink. The letters were then pasted onto pieces of wood and ready
    for printing.  <BR>    What was so cool though was that the letters where made
    from different materials which yielded different printing results. Some letters,
    for instance, had fuzzy edges because they were cut from rugs, and others had
    different patterns on them due to the patterns that where on the tile. All these
    differences coud be found on the same poster, very cool. I visited a Barnes and
    Noble and they had the book for sale, you can check it out, or maybe search the
    net for any info on the exhibit. <BR> <BR>IM
