  let me know if I'm wrong). I assume this because it seems as though different designers
  created her logos for her albums and merch.\r\n\r\nWondering if I can find a font
  super similar to it for a friend, but can't seem to find anything remotely close
  besides P22 Victorian Swash (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/victorian-gothic/swash/).
  Even that's too off base for the project!"
