  face, but I haven't been able to choose between Miller, Chronicle, and Ingeborg.
  I need something that would look good at 11 or 12 pt.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts:
  Miller is absolutely lovely to me, great numerals, great italic, great punctuation,
  but had the ill fortune of being born too soon (pre-Opentype era), so it has certain
  lacks. Chronicle is executed amazingly, but comes off--to my eyes, anyway--almost
  over-refined (and bland in comparison with Miller). Ingeborg is intriguing, but
  I haven't seen it in print anywhere (and it's the most expensive).\r\n\r\nAdvice?"

    also has an intriguing quirkiness to it, though is missing small caps and other
    such features.

    I suspect that there is a lot more, so if you actually prefer that one, you should
    call Font Bureau to find out what is in the font.  '

  body: "Ingeborg is <em>not</em> a Scotch Roman. It is, however, an absolutely splendid
    typeface, and I'd buy it anyway if I were you.\r\n\r\nIf you are absolutely set
    on having a Scotch Roman, then Nick's Scotch Modern is one of the most authentic.
    I think of Miller and Chronicle more as \u2018inspired-by\u2019 than true Scotches
    (H&FJ describe Chronicle, amusingly, as a \u2018blendid Scotch\u2019): they update
    the style for contemporary tastes, notably in reducing the stroke contrast. They're
    both very nice types, and Miller is largely responsible for reviving interest
    in the genre, but whether it is appropriate depends on how much you want to evoke
    the full on spiky look of a page of Victorian typesetting.\r\n\r\n[Nick, I think
    you should market Scotch Modern as \u2018The single malt of Scotch Romans\u2019.]"

  body: "Thanks John!\r\n\r\nAlthough strictly speaking Scotch Modern, being a didone,
    is not a subset of Scotch Roman, which is transitional.\r\n\r\nYes, it's confusing,
    but as people traditionally referred to such faces as \"Modern\", and today as
    \"Scotch\", I thought the name would be appropriate. (And cite James Mosley for
    precedent, in <em>A Tally of Types</em>)."

  body: "John \u2014 As Nick hints at, you\u2019re conflating the Scotch Roman style
    with the Scotch branch of Victorian moderns, which came to be known as Scotch
    (without the Roman qualifier).\r\n\r\nMatthew once chastised me for the same mistake:
    <em>\u201CI would not refer to the types cut by Austin for Miller as \"Moderns.\"
    Scotch Roman was really a warmer reaction against the more rigorous Moderns.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nIronically,
    the appellation \u201CScotch Roman\u201D doesn\u2019t actually attach to this
    style until it is imported to America by the foundry of A. D. Farmer & Sons in
    1903. \r\n\r\nLater adaptations blended with other modern strains and dropped
    the \"Roman.\" Another branch fed into designs like Century and Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThe
    nomenclature and taxonomy are a bit confusing."

    A little Scotch, with some Bourbon and Cognac mixed in. And it comes in four optical

  body: Thanks, Kent. Well, that's embarrassing. I guess my associations with the
    term 'Scotch Roman' are a bit out of whack, perhaps from having squinted my way
    through so many Victorian editions set in Scotch romans.
