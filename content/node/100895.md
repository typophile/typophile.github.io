  body: "Oh, that is a very pretty typeface! I like it. Although a little too display
    for body copy for my purposes. But I will keep it in mind for a future project.
    No nice. Nice work. Thank you for the recommendation. \r\n\r\nI think I asked
    my question in a confusing way, now that I read it again. Darn.\r\n\r\nWhat can
    typeface can I use as body text when Pluto is the display? "

    at 4 point!\r\n\r\nHopefully you'll get some better recommendations though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
