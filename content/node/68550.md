  first time I saw the original Maple Pictures logo I knew the $12.50 I'd spent was
  worth it, even if the movie was a piece of piss. The way the animation rotated and
  the tree rings formed the letters just struck a chord in me. \r\n\r\nAND THEN THIS
  HAPPENED!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MaplePictures_New_5998.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  in the hell were they thinking? What does this say other than we typeset some letters
  and put a box around them? \r\n\r\nI have started this thread hoping to see you
  add other logos/branding that were redesigned so poorly that you're left wondering
  \"How did this happen?\"\r\n\r\nPepsi anyone?"

    is even worse than the old 90s logo."

    Bank of New York - I loved the logo they had before \u2014 It's gorgeous. Sad
    they went with a sideways star trek badge after the merger."

    even have words for that one.\r\n\r\nThe Animal Planet redesign bothered me as
    well. I wasn't a fan of Discovery's redesign initially either (not that the old
    one was especially good) but it's grown on me: http://www.frederiksamuel.com/blog/2008/04/discovery-channel-rebranding.html"
