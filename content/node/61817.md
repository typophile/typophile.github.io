  involved in the conversation here and showing and sharing ideas. Really lovin the
  community from what I see.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a couple logo projects right now.
  Here is one of them:\r\n\"For the Sake of the Name\" conference logo\r\n\r\nIt is
  for an all staff conference/retreat for a Christian ministry organization. Want
  it to be fun, not too \"serious,\" but to show a sort of professionalism. \r\n\r\nHere
  is what I've done so far. I would be super grateful for your thoughts:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture4_4662.jpg]"

  body: "I like the top two (A). Would you care to explain the shape? It made me think
    of an island, or hills reflecting in the ocean.\r\n\r\nOn the font: I like it,
    but depending on your audience, it might be to organic. Also, the \"for the sake
    of\" part seems a bit out of place: Because it's rather similar to the other typeface,
    it looks more like a mistake than a deliberate choice."

  body: "thanks, frode frank.\r\n\r\nGood thoughts. The shape, yes, should reflect
    a lake and rolling hills a bit, but not too much. The conference is supposed to
    be more of a retreat than sessions & learning etc, so they want a more relaxed,
    but professional look to the branding and materials.\r\n\r\nAbout the fonts, I'll
    keep working at it. And post some new ideas. \r\n\r\nI also don't like the fonts
    on (B) - would that be better if the fonts were re-worked?\r\nThanks again."

  body: "I don't think the B alternative work very well. The sun and hills look to
    amateurish. I'd say leave it. Focus on A or other alternatives. \r\n\r\nI'd consider
    making the grey horisont line white, and playing around with transparent shades
    of blue (water) and green (hills). \r\nPerhaps a venetian serif like <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/eason\">Eason</a>
    could give you an organic, lively touch without being to cheesy? \r\n\r\nRembember
    to consider how this will work in one colour."

    the white horizon line, but thought maybe the new treatment might work? the line
    hides behind the background before getting to the end.\r\n\r\nHere is my newest
    version of A. Thanks again to anyone who can offer some thoughts and pointers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/imageA_4098.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PictureA_6301.png]"

  body: "I was hoping someone else would comment on this as well. I'm more of a student,
    so I would take my words with a grain of salt. Anyhow, here's my two cents: \r\n\r\nThe
    type look more suiting to the audience, just remember to give your caps some breathing
    space. Normal capitals are not spaced to work together in an all cap setting and
    need to be tracked out a bit. Thus, professional fonts have Small Caps especially
    made for these situations, and also slightly lower (and wider) making them stand
    out less in text.\r\n\r\nTwo things are sticking out. The numerals (are they scaled
    up old style figures? \u2013 they are much heavier) and the first line (set in
    lower case only). Both are bugging me because they're not being echoed anywhere
    else, and I'm generally bugged by a sentence not starting with a capital when
    there's no apparent reason for it not to;) \r\n\r\nI would love to see the island
    on it's own, with no type on top of it! Perhaps a few different versions with
    smaller type (It think it might be a bit large)."

    someone is not a type guru (though am really wanting to learn more). Students
    sometimes have a fresh perspective that others might not. Have to show clients
    some ideas today, so am working hard on that. Once we nail down a direction to
    go in, I'll post more here. \r\n\r\nIf anyone else has thoughts to add, I will
    be continuing to work on this project."

  body: "I'll echo everything Frode pointed out above. I'll also give a further reason
    for changing the black line in the mark to white (or another color if you find
    a better alternative). Right now, the line in black makes it look like another
    element of the text, not something related to the mark. A logo that already has
    so many textual elements, such as this, doesn't need more confusion from the mark.\r\n\r\nI'd
    like to see the mark perhaps a bit smaller and on its own, away from the text.
    Experiment with other kinds of fonts as well. I'm not sure this serif is going
    to cut it.\r\n\r\n\r\npenn"

    seems out of place.\r\n\r\nhave you tried 'for the sake of' in either small caps
    or all caps (spaced wider)?\r\n\r\nalso, i'd experiment making 'cadence 2010 conference'
    smaller, so that it's about the same width as 'the name' or the line.\r\n\r\ni'd
    also agree with trying a version with the mark and text separate.\r\n\r\nall the

    ones (C & D) and keep with the original. Thanks for your time.\r\n\r\n@Simon -\r\nThanks
    for the welcome! Good thoughts on lining up the bottom text. I've worked a little
    on that but I will continue to keep it in mind for the next revision. \r\n\r\n@penn
    - thanks too for your thoughts on the line. I have implemented a white line. Making
    it thinner works. I did try taking it out altogether but then it kind of lost
    something - didn't make sense as to why the words were arranged how they are.
    But I'm still working with it.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to all -\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_5485.3image.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_4795.4image.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C_6701.1image.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2010image_6154.jpg]"

  body: Megan, I still think you should try moving the mark away from the text, and
    experiment with a few different typefaces. The mark is rather busy, even without
    text layered over it.
