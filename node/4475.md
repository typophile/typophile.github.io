body: I came across the &#34;Design on a Budget&#34; issue of Computer Arts, and bought
  it solely because I thought I was getting a full version of TypeTool. How long should
  I expect to wait for them to reply with my serial number? Have I been had?

  body: I believe, from reading the information on the disk, that it is a full classic
    application with a demo version of Type Tool 2.0, which is OS X compatible. I
    am still waiting for the serial numbers despite numerous attempts, I&#39;ll sit
    here drumming my fingers.

  body: 'To confirm: yes, the disk comes with two full applications, scanfont and
    typetool for Mac OS 9. It also houses demo versions of the programs &#40;including
    fontlab&#41; for OS X. There are also some Cape Arcona fonts and some other demos. '
