body: "Hello typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm completely blank on this area, so I thought i
  would seek advice here. I would greatly appreaciate any feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for suitable type for beer-house, that recently changed it's name after an old brewery
  that used to be on the same street (apparently more than 200 years ago \u2013 from
  what I can udnerstand of their PR-material)\r\n\r\nA secondary element of my type
  choice is the home-like and unpretentious spirit of the beer-house, with their friendly
  service (e.g. the spirits on the first floor are self serviced, so you just take
  your glass of whiskey and pay on the way out). But for now, I'd like to just get
  a hint for tracking up relevant type/fonts for old style breweries.\r\n\r\nMy thought
  is, that I'd rather stay clear of too stereotypical german style blackletters, but
  still have some of it in it (I'm not even sure if blackletter is a relevant guess
  in any way, but again, I'm completely blank here!). \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMalte"

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions. I think I'm in the lines of declarations script
    style, but I think it needs to be a little less authentic and a bit more warm,
    friendly and contemporary. Perhaps if someone had made a thicker script typeface
    with a strong inspiration from that kind of old style type, it would suit me quite
    well.\r\n\r\n\u2013 <em>Malte</em>"

  body: "Thank you very much rusellm. I will have a look at that site soon.\r\n\r\nI
    really like the direction towards Thomas Hardy's Ale and agree in your description.
    Now, if it only had a slightly more \"swing\" in it, and if not completely script-styled,
    then maybe some swashes. Would that synthesis be possible?\r\n\r\n\u2013 <em>Malte</em>"
