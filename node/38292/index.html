  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just had a fascinating discussion with someone who claimed no type designers use OS X (for a variety of technical reasons), which absolutely blew my mind. I know for a fact Ed Benguiat uses a Mac since I studied under him at SVA, and I&rsquo;m (perhaps erroneously) assuming that most Mac users are currently using FontLab Studio under OS X.</p>
<p>Can anyone with first-hand knowledge talk about what systems are used by the folks at Adobe, Linotype, ITC, etc?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to start a platform war/discussion, it just amazed me that anyone thought it would make much difference which system type was digitized on, since most designers I know of work on paper first and then use Fontlab software (whether FontLab Studio or Fontographer) that is cross-platform. But it did get me curious if there was some sort of massive systems change that took place since I left NYC and stopped doing things with the Type Director&rsquo;s Club.</p>
<p>I know occasionally we have discussion on the more technical nature of digital type here, but most type designers I&rsquo;ve known haven&rsquo;t spent much time worrying about the algorithms or technology behind any particular system, so long as they got good results out of it when the file was sent to the imagesetter.</p>

<p>So the typoratti sporting shiny new Mac laptops and iPhones at TypeCon were just using these as fashion accessories to go along with their black Audi S4&rsquo;s and wire rimmed glasses? And back in the office they all use Windows XP and FontLab?</p>
<p>&ldquo;someone&rdquo; is pulling your leg or very badly informed. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No, that&rsquo;s the thing &ndash; he was completely convinced of this, and he&rsquo;s deadly serious that the horrible antialiasing (and numerous other technical deficiencies) on OS X makes it useless for type design. Of course everyone I know personally is using Fontlab Studio on OS X (with the occassional XP system), but we&rsquo;re all nobodies in the greater scheme of type design. I couldn&rsquo;t find any specific references on Google to the software/hardware used by Slimbach or Zapf or Kobayashi or Frutiger so I&rsquo;m left simply wondering, now that the bug is in my brain :D</p>
<p>Does FontLab ever mention platform breakdown numbers? Since they pretty much own the market (at least as far as I know! :P) I can&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;d have to worry about some competitor getting an advantage by knowing where their sales are.</p>

Don&rsquo;t know if he also uses a PC, but he does a fine job on his Mac. Zapf and Frutiger don&rsquo;t do computers - they rely on Akira for that. I don&rsquo;t know about Slimbach - Tom can likely tell us about his preferences.</p>
<p>There are certainly a lot of type designers on Windows and a lot on Macs - and quite a few who work on both platforms. It would be interesting to see the numbers breakdown.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your friend is &ldquo;convinced&rdquo; but you give no evidence of what convinced him/her. I know a bunch of type designers. Some use Mac, some use PC, some use both at least for testing. Some like the Macs with intel chips because they can do both on the same machine. The antialiasing thing makes no sense. There are plenty of folks who prefer the Mac way of displaying over PC. The only issue may be screen use only fonts for web where the user-base of web pages is 90% PC so designers of screen media look to match the majority&rsquo;s expectations. Most font sales are for print media users who are mostly Mac using graphic designers. I don&rsquo;t have numbers from a real study but I have enough anecdotal experience to know that your friends assertion that &ldquo;No Type designers use OSX&rdquo; is just plain ridiculous and false. I would guess that the majority of type designers use Macs to design type but a greater number of computer geeks who do post-design production, tweaking, verification, and TrueType hinting, use PCs.</p>

Linnea Lundquist and Carol also used a Mac. Of course we used to have proprietary Unix tools which were used for font editing in the &ldquo;old days&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I remember there was a time when we thought maybe Mac OS was going to die and we&rsquo;d all be stuck with production on Windows, but then thankfully OS X came along and we were all saved! :-)</p>

I said that he sounded like a programmer with an interest in type rather than a type designer, because everything he was concerned about were issues of rendering, interpolation algorithms, pixel grid fitting, etc &ndash; which as I pointed out at the time are meaningless to 90% of designers since the imagesetter doesn&rsquo;t care about any of that stuff. In my 15 years I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard the word &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; uttered at a Type Directors Club or AIGA gathering, outside of technical presentations by someone from Adobe back in the days of Multiple Master and such.</p>

<p>The original claim didn&rsquo;t specify &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; either. If we&rsquo;re talking about active type designers, I would say FontLab licenses sold in, say, the past three years would be a good measuring stick, and I doubt the numbers would be as slanted as you suggest.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Speaking as part of the Windows-using minority, I&rsquo;m clear that the majority of professional type design today is done on Mac OS. There is a substantial minority on Windows, though. I can&rsquo;t say whether the Mac percentage is 60 or 75, but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s somewhere in that range.</p>
<p>The reasons I&rsquo;m on Windows are mostly, but not entirely, unrelated to type design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new beta versions of FontLab come out on Windows a long time before the equivalent Mac version. (The time gap is a lot smaller if you&rsquo;re waiting for the official release, though.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adobe has a bunch of internal business processes that are Windows-centric</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outlook sucks less than Entourage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when I switched from mac to Windows for my main machine, OS X had just come out and was not really ready for prime time, plus you couldn&rsquo;t get a Mac laptop with 1200 pixels of vertical resolution on its LCD screen. Both of these factors are no longer true, however.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you won&rsquo;t see rasterization differences on my list of why I&rsquo;m on Windows! Yes, I liked Microsoft&rsquo;s rendering better than Apple&rsquo;s the last time I did a head-to-head comparison (which was not recent). But most of my testing and work is in Adobe applications, which use Adobe&rsquo;s rendering, regardless of platform. So it&rsquo;s not a big issue.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>T</p>

<p>Sounds to me like an interest in screen fonts ;-) The poll will show that most people Here use Mac OSX. 
What the poll will not likely show is where they expect the &ldquo;fonts&rdquo; they produce to qualitatively peak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked Microsoft’s rendering better than Apple’s the last time I did a head-to-head&hellip;&rdquo;
Thomas, I assume this also means you like MS rendering better than Adobe&rsquo;s ;?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe I&rsquo;m hopelessly naive and I am also a graphic designer NOT a type designer, but wouldn&rsquo;t it behoove type designers to at least test out their fonts on the Mac OS? Given that most graphic designers use Macs and we represent the bulk of the font-buyers—at least of boutique fonts as opposed to the ones that come with the OS or in large Adobe packages. There are probably some talented graphic designers using windows somewhere out there, but I doubt they&rsquo;d get much work (at least in NYC). This business is heavily Mac-dominant here. Again I know next to nothing about font creation, merely about font usage.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just to tie into what Ralf posted, in the current MATD course at Reading (three of whom can be seen in the photo with Gerry), ten of the twelve of us use Apple laptops, each running system 10+. An 11th student is on a Windows PC, but seems to be teetering on the edge of conversion! And the 12th is running some sort of Linux thing. The Typography department&rsquo;s computers are also Macs, and the little application we install to print only works with OS X.</p>
<p>I wonder what the Hague&rsquo;s set-up looks like? I suspect they have at least a few Macs. So, if this is any indicator, I don&rsquo;t think many type designers out there are boycotting OS X. At the ATypI conference in Brighton last September, there certainly were PCs, but really quite a lot of shiny macs as well.</p>

<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t call it conversion. i&rsquo;m just afraid that mac support of OT is so buggy that i can&rsquo;t just rely on it to work (like it does in windows) without testing some basic scenarios. could i say you&rsquo;re coverting to PC if you&rsquo;re installing windows to build, set, test your Indic? &gt;^p</p>

I wish I could afford a new Mac that allows switch-hitting. There will always be little annoying things creep in when any OS is reworked so we will always have a need for testing the computer foreign to us, whichever that may be.</p>
