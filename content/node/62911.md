  I've recently been really in love with these fat serif typefaces like ITC Serif
  Gothic, Grouch (wish I could buy that, but alas), et cetera.\r\n\r\nI wanted to
  get Caslon Graphique, but I'm having a bit of trouble finding any difference between
  all the offerings/cuts on MyFonts that may make me want to spend more than URW's
  asking price of $19.95.\r\n\r\nThe three versions:\r\n\r\nURW's Caslon Graphique
  D for $19.95: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/caslon-graphique/\r\n\r\nScangraphic's
  Caslon Graphique SH for $26: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/caslon-graphique-sh/\r\n\r\nElsner+Flake's
  Caslon Graphique EF for $35: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/caslon-graphique/\r\n\r\nForgive
  me if the answer to my query has an obvious answer. I haven't bought a whole lot
  of fonts, just some essentials."

  body: "Go for the URW cut. \r\nNot only is it cheaper, but it has an extensive number
    of fractions. Half Thirds Quarters Fifths Sixths and Eighths and nut fractions
    for Half and Quarters. You don't see that in many fonts and certainly not in the
    Scangraphic or the EF versions of this typeface.\r\nURW has superscript and subscript
    figures which the other two versions lack. However it would've been great if it
    had superscript s t h e m etc.\r\nThe URW version also has nicer Math symbols
    they are hairlines which is pretty interesting I just wish it had alternate thin
    parentheses but the parentheses are pretty much the same in all three fonts.\r\nEF
    seems to be missing multiply sign and you definitely don't want to use the lowercase
    x instead.\r\nURW @ is by far the nicest. However I liked the asterisk in Scangraphic.\r\nURW
    and Scangraphic seem to have the same set width whereas EF seems to be wider which
    is not a good thing in my opinion (not the letterforms but just how wide a line
    of text is). I think a 10pt URW is slightly smaller than a 10pt Scangraphic but
    this should not affect your decision at all.\r\nURW has the most glyphs but Scangraphic
    has the big advantage of including titling Umlauts and a titling \xC5. EF is out
    of the equation for this one.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow, thank you very much, johnnydib. That was a most outstanding reply and
    look into how they differ. I did see how many glyphs the URW version had and was
    extremely impressed and confused as to why it'd be the cheapest.\r\n\r\nMy only
    wish is that it had an ampersand (&) like <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0001003\">Cabernet</a>
    or <a href=\"http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/b/benguiat-caslon.html\">Benguiat
    Caslon Swash</a> (which doesn't seem to be on sale)."

  body: "Yeah that's a very nice &. I can't think of any similar ampersands right
    now. But you can always use an ampersand from a different font, as long as the
    weights match. InDesign makes it super easy with GREP.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah lower price
    is not necessarily lower quality and more glyphs is not necessarily better. It's
    the application that matters. \r\n\r\nMaybe the one with the higher price has
    a more generous EULA."

  body: "David - as these are all digitizations of a pre-digital typeface, there will
    be very slight variations in lettershape, kerning, and character set. It would
    be handy if I could tell you that one foundry's versions are always the best.
    Unfortunately, the methods and policies of each of these foundries changed over
    the years, and some are better than others depending on the era and the typeface.\r\n\r\nAlso
    keep in mind that more glyphs does not necessarily equal better font. Many of
    these foundries use automated techniques to fill out the extras in the glyph set
    and that can sometimes lead to less-than-ideal results.\r\n\r\nAll that said,
    I love Caslon Graphique and I think you'll be fine with the URW version for the
    reasons Johnny mentions. But you might also want to have a look at these other
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/extra_bold_high_contrast_serifs/\">high
    contrast headline serifs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/staff_picks/swash_ampersands/\">swashy
    ampersands</a> for more modern fonts that were made from scratch for the digital
    world.\r\n\r\nHappy birthday!"

    have been numerous threads on Typophile regarding pricing. You should check the

    in and watch the discussions, but yeah, thanks for not redirecting me to the search
    function or giving me any of those replies (some of which I saw quite recently).
    But it's a forum\u2014that stuff exists on any forum, believe me.\r\n\r\nThank
    you, Stephen, for the help. I am just starting to understand how much there possibly
    is to know about type beyond serif/sans-serif, modern and old faces, kerning,
    et cetera... and by that I mean I probably have almost no understanding at all.
    But it is extremely important and interesting to me. Every little bit is good
    to know."
