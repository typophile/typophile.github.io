  what the \"Table Grapes\" part is?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tablegrapes_3434.jpg]"

  body: Wow, it looks like I've stumped the type ID ninjas since nobody's responded
    yet! Usually stuff gets ID'd in like 5 minutes around here. Maybe it's hand-drawn
    and doesn't exist as a font? Somehow I doubt that.

  body: "Hi Brad,\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s not a font, at least not a good one. ;-)\r\nYou
    can find a similar \u2018p\u2019 in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/gill_sans_std_bold_italic/&sample_text=Table%20Grapes&sample_size=60\">Gill
    Sans Bold Italic</a>. The spikey endings and the overall liveliness remind me
    of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_goudy_sans_pro_black_italic/&sample_text=Table%20Grapes&sample_size=60\">Goudy
    Sans Black Italic</a>. But both fonts are far from being a hit, sorry.\r\nF"

  body: Yeah, the "p" does look like Gill Sans, and I couldn't remember the name "Goudy
    Sans," although I was thinking of it. You're right, it's not very well-drawn,
    but the shape of that "s" is intriguing. The whole thing is so weird and quirky.
    I think that's why I like it. :)
