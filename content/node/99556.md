  I'm trying to generate font samples, but the glyphs are distorted![img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_6384.jpg]\r\n\r\nTake
  a look at the screen capture. There are some strokes noticeable darker than others...
  strangely, when printing to PDF from InDesign everything seems to be OK.\r\n\r\nWhat
  the problem could be?"

  body: When you are printing direct from inside FL, you are printing are raw outlines,
    not a font per se. When you generate a font, install it and create a document
    in InDesign, you get the outlines as handled by the font layout engine and, most
    likely, with hinting applied.

  body: "Oh, I see... so what's the point in the first place of being able to generate
    different kind of printings in FL if you are not going to get an accurate representation
    of your font? That sounds very strange to me...\r\n\r\nAnyways, I can always install
    the font into my system and print from InDesign, but I will lose the nice layouts
    of FL ( Is there such a thing as ID templates for font test sheets?"
