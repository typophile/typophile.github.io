    BORDER=0> Thanks. IS rather difficult to ID the serif type comparing to the sans...
    Thanks Yves!

    the giveaway? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how to id Garamond, esp not in upper case.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: 'Yves is right. Looks a bit like semibold SmallCaps, but that&#39;s hard to
    tell on  a screen-printed shirt without some other letters. Bit the letterform
    of the Garamond is distinctive enough to be pretty sure even so.  <BR>The letterspacing
    could be better, though :-D. '

    the giveaway?</i> <BR> <BR>Karen, I don&#39;t know very well how to answer that
    without  <BR>sounding like the conceited arrogant ba$tard I am. ;P <BR> <BR>In
    short, at first glance it &#34;felt&#34; like Adobe Garamond. This  <BR>always
    plays a big part in those &#39;3-minutes&#39; ID&#39;s, and I don&#39;t  <BR>know
    if anyone else can confirm that &#40;Stephen, Chesh, Tiff,  <BR>Hrant, anyone?&#41;
    There&#39;s a certain balance, thoughtfulness and  <BR>smoothness to the face
    that&#39;s undeniable &#40;for me anyways&#41;. <BR>It&#39;s like placing my hand
    on my wife&#39;s hip: I don&#39;t know by any  <BR>means what the exact curve
    should be or what the precise  <BR>texture of her skin is like, but I can tell
    it&#39;s my wife&#39;s hip. <BR> <BR>Once I got past the initial &#39;gut-feeling&#39;
    stage, the serifs on  <BR>the uc &#39;S&#39; told me it was a Slimbach design,
    and both the  <BR>shape of the nick at the apex of the uc &#39;A&#39; and the
    overall  <BR>weight distribution confirmed it was Adobe Garamond. I didn&#39;t  <BR>even
    check. ;P <BR> <BR> <BR>I warned you for the &#39;conceited arrogant ba$tard&#39;
    bit! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>And now somebody comes in and proves it&#39;s Garamond
    BQ  <BR>or whatever :/'

    <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right, especially all-caps. If it weren&#39;t for &#39;gut-feeling&#39;,  <BR>I
    would&#39;ve needed a run through the FontBook or at least  <BR>some looking-up
    in Rookledge&#39;s. <BR>Furthermore, there&#39;s more than a few &#39;Garamonds&#39;
    around,  <BR>and even more related and similar typefaces.

  body: I agree with you Yves. It&#39;s all about the gut! --- If you train your eye
    to look at the fiddly details, often it is simply just one of those fiddly details
    that helps you with the ID. --- Yves has much better skills at this and it sounds
    like he&#39;s spent much more time, than I have, looking through the type specimen
    books. His ways are the best. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: That S is a pretty good Garamond indicator, but nothing says Garamond like
    the two differently angled serifs on the top of the T. If Sylvian had a T in his
    name, that pretty much would have been a dead giveaway. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/11744.gif"
    alt="sylvian"> <BR> <BR>Even so, the screen printing made it a little harder to
    ID. Good job, Yves.
