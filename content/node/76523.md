body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nSo I am starting a book project for which I am using a very complete
  and well designed typeface, the files are .otf. I thought .otf meant OpenType and
  that's it, I just discovered the different OpenType flavored types, which I don't
  quite understand yet, anyway, not the point...\r\n\r\nSo I checked and my typeface
  is an OpenType (Postscript Flavored).\r\n\r\nNow... I am using the Book weight,
  which contains all the basic characters, but not the ligatures. For the ligatures,
  there is the Book Alt version, which contains all the nice ligatures that I would
  like to use in my text treatment...\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, OpenType would
  contain everything in one font file, these flavored things do not, because of the
  256 glyphs limit, right?\r\n\r\nAnyway, so how would I go about setting InDesign
  (CS5) to automatically recognize \"st ct ff fi fl\" etc etc., and replace them with
  the ligatures from the Book Alt font file?\r\n\r\nI know OpenTypes discussions are
  all over the place, but I couldn't find an answer for that specific case.\r\n\r\nPlease
  anyone, any help will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n"

    OpenType \"flavours\" does support 16,384 glyphs and thus must include all features
    (ligatures, alternates, small caps, tabular figures, etc.) in one single file.
    The problem here is your font file, which does not include all glyph it would
    contain. Maybe they are just converted Type1 files, without any additional OpenType
    resources.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this, you can use GREP styles and substitutions,
    as Clauses said. If you don't know about GREP, take a look on InDesign Help and
    on articles about GREP at [[http://www.bing.com/search?cp=1252&FORM=FREESS&q=GREP&q1=site%3Aindesignsecrets.com|InDesign
    Secrets]]."
