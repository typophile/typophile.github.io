body: "I guess this is an RFQ, after all. Although really all I'm after is the general
  price range.\r\n\r\nLet's say I've fallen in love with a couple of typefaces, and
  I think they would pair beautifully just as they are, and I've bought them for my
  print uses.\r\n\r\nLet's say that screens are an important target medium for me,
  and initial tests suggest that the fonts I've bought have some minor problems at
  typical screen sizes (I go for 15px, more or less).\r\n\r\nI saw a vid clip once
  w/ Erik Spiekermann saying \"when someone asks me for a font like font-X, I study
  it for a couple of days and then walk away from it for a couple of days and only
  THEN do I start to draw letters, relying on memory alone...\" thereby ensuring that
  the new font is inspired by, but not a knock-off of, the source font. I think this
  is a cool idea.\r\n\r\nSo let's say the design spec was: \"here's two typefaces,
  I use them for my print stuff. I need similar faces that work better for web: slightly
  larger x-height, slightly more open counterforms, slightly larger aperature, slightly
  bigger letter spacing, blah blah blah. Oh, and x-height equalized between the two.
  Normal, Italics (true italics preferred), Bold, and Bold Italics for each.\"\r\n\r\nOh
  and one of the source-inspiration fonts (the serif) doesn't have an italics to start
  with (and I know that that's for historical-accuracy purposes).\r\n\r\nWhat's this
  gonna set me back?!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.s. as a bonus, how much additional
  to make me my type-based logo and draw my accompanying dragon-icon-logo for me?"

  body: "There are several points that need to be specified in detail to calculate
    pricing. I'm going to try to list as many as I can think of here. If you lot have
    more let me hear.\r\n\r\n1) Glyph repertoire. Which languages have to be supported?
    (more glyphs, more time, time is money). Some styles are faster to design something
    like small caps for, eg. sans serif designs. Numerals: All four types or just
    one? Do you really need italic small caps?\r\n\r\n2) Quality \u2013 designing
    typefaces is an iterative process. Spend more time, get a better result. More
    time, more money.\r\n\r\n3) Intellectual property rights \u2013 Which immaterial
    rights are transferred to you, the client? A 'full buy-out' transfers all right
    for perpetuity (until they fall into the public domain) to you the client, and
    the designer does not get a royalty. This form of buy-out is costly, and based
    on the scope of the use. Large corporations with global use for all employees,
    and for all marketing, pay a lot more for this than a small company.\r\n\r\n3)
    Transfer rights. Can you, the client, sell, lend, or give away the typeface? This
    costs more. Is the typeface used in computer software incl. mobile telephones,
    sat-nav, television sets, set-top boxes, &c?\r\n\r\n4) Technical considerations.
    How good does the fonts have to be technically speaking? Which software environments
    does the fonts have to work in, in which environments would 'partial functionality'
    be accepted, and which environments does not apply?\r\n\r\nSince screen rendering
    is important for you, then you must define exactly which environments you are
    talking about. Take as an example the popular (or so I've heard) Windows operating
    system. There are many versions of Windows with different rendering engines, combine
    that with user settings, browser versions, and user hardware and you have a very
    long list of targets. The 'hinting' process makes fonts render better on Windows.
    Hinting can be slow and expensive \u2013 especially if you target non-aliased
    environments.\r\n\r\nIn many professional fields there goes the saying \"You can
    have it good, fast, cheap. Pick any two.\" In typeface design you get to pick
    one."

    you could expect to spend probably $20,000-60,000 USD on a project like that.
    Not too hard to keep it toward the lower end of that if you shop around and aren't
    set on using one of just a couple of specific designers.\r\n\r\nYes, that's a
    big range. People's rates vary, as does quality and speed. More time and money
    from a given designer will give you more polish.\r\n\r\nReally big name type designers
    might charge more like ~ $100,000 per family, btw. Of course, they will usually
    only do it one way as well, really polished.\r\n\r\nThese are just ballparks,

  body: "Chris: I wonder if what Hrant was saying was that seeing other people's analysis
    of the tasks and work involved might be educational, and help others notice potential
    gotchas and issues in the work? I recently had occasion to be consulted in the
    development of the RFP for a middling-large font project, and I must say that
    I caught more things each time I went over it. I imagine that responses to an
    RFP could be similar in that regard, if they were public.\r\n\r\nThat being said,
    I agree that in most lines of work the proposals coming in are not public, and
    that there are competitive reasons for this related to pricing, and secondarily
    related to simply sharing expertise. Having proposals coming in be public would
    probably tend to generate more homogenous pricing (pushing pricing toward the
    lower middle, I expect), and making public the analysis-of-work component of the
    proposals would tend to give the largest benefit to the less experienced folks
    involved.\r\n\r\nSo, at first blush I'm thinking public proposals are on average
    good for the lower-mid to very low-end producers, and probably bad for the upper-mid-range
    folks. Probably minimal effect on the top end, as they aren't competing on price
    anyway and have plenty of expertise to not miss issues in the project definition.
    Probably neutral to good for the customer, though that depends on a variety of
    particulars, including the complexity of the project and their likely price range
    and price sensitivity."

  body: "Having done an enormous amount of custom font development during my career,
    my advice would be to put an average per glyph price on the work and present the
    results of the multiplier to your client as the price of the job,\r\n\r\nPer glyph
    price would include drawing, spacing kerning, and hinting, and could vary quite
    a bit based on level of exclusivity the final work would fit into.. One glyph
    may take an hour to draw and one may be a component assembly that is done in 5
    seconds. That is why an AVERAGE per glyph price should be used in the calculations.
    Whatever that variation in price, I've found clients respond best to this approach
    rather than some number that to them may seemed plucked out of the air."

    fairly detailed glyph set analysis before quoting on font development, so are
    able to distinguish base glyphs and composites and assign different costs to each
    for design and hinting. Other aspects of the development, e.g. OpenType Layout
    work, is separately calculated based on time estimates.
