  but my question is to do with handwriting and I&#39;d like very much to hear your
  thoughts on the following matter. <BR> <BR>I recently stumbled across an old website
  advocating the teaching of italic, joined-up handwriting in UK schools rather than
  separate letters. Here&#39;s a link to the site: <BR> <BR><a href="http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/quilljar/init.html"
  target="_blank">http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/quilljar/init.html</a> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
  the bit that interested me: <BR> <BR><blockquote>&#34;..In 1913 the LCC  &#40;London
  County Council&#41; School inspectors decided to encourage teachers of infants to
  use a  print script based upon the 10th Century Winchester Bible. An expert on lettering,
  Edward Johnston, had told the LCC that he recommended that approach for his Art
  School students. Unfortunately, it proved disastrous for small children, who have
  now been taught lettering from the age of five instead of joined-up writing. <BR>
  <BR>Plenty of research has shown that handwriting is the learning of a physical
  activity. Poor habits learnt early are very hard indeed to change. Learning the
  staccato stop - go - stop way of writing separate letters, however clear they may
  be, does not help with cursive &#40;joined&#41; writing later on.&#34;</blockquote>
  <BR> <BR>I certainly find writing in italics to require less force/energy/effort
  than writing separate letters. However, my italic handwriting isn&#39;t very pretty,
  and I&#39;ve always thought writing separate letters to be neater, clearer and better-looking
  &#40;although I realise this will vary greatly from individual to individual&#41;.  <BR>
  <BR>Do you agree that teaching italic, joined-up writing is a better approach than
  teaching young children to write separate letters for handwriting? Which do you
  prefer? And is there indeed any evidence to back one method over another?'

  body: 'Simply from the basis of ease and speed, joined italic writing beats other
    forms of handwriting: it is a very efficient script. So from a writing perspective,
    I favour it, even though I never learned it properly and have largely fallen back
    on something closer to Johnston&#39;s script, which is slower and more wearying.
    <BR> <BR>The Norwegian experiment to which Hrant directs our attention is interesting
    and seems to me a good thing on the whole, but its radicalness needs to be seen
    in the Norwegian context: &#39;Instruction in cursive handwriting is postponed
    until the age of eight, when it is taught in a fraction of the time normally spent
    on the subject.&#39; How many North American school children develop any kind
    of decent handwriting before the age of eight anyway?'

    mine was certainly better when I was in first grade. <BR> <BR>However: &#34;Prof

    of handwriting lessons sticks with people or even affects their development. How
    do different teaching styles at different ages effect your writing when you are
    20 or 30? It seems like most of us were taught in similar way of how to properly
    draw regular and cursive letters, but everyone has such different looking writing
    when they get older. <BR> <BR>I am not sure how this relates, but driver&#39;s
