I would dare to make them different: The stem of the r like your top example but longer (being necessary to tell it from s), but the stem of the m trimmed away entirely.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I find it very hard to read and this is already at a very large size. Unless you are using it big like this on posters or something I think it will not come across well. On something like the web or a business card it's not going to be legible, I fear.

Perhaps a thicker weight and a bit looser tracking. I don't know what else to say other than I think this would be best read and presented with more appropriate use of white space.

		<div class="commentbody">A good point of view tylor but yes, maybe it will be just this size because i'll only have this logo on some stuff (that i already know ehehe) anyway i'm making other logos and so but i think that type won't work since there will always be a stem so it can be really readable. I don't want to get it on a classic way i still love japan and so thats why thelines are like this. So... now... i'm doing something more on the "mark" side.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok. I've done my "mark" already. I think that you all are able to see that it came from the inicials yrmk.
Done a lot of marks around that one but it seems for me (and for the people i asked) that the most calibrated option was the best... Anyway i posted my three options so you can get me your opinion too (total options were about 20/30, there are the reduced ones)
But now i'm with other problem... Lettering. A mark has always to have a lettering around... people just can't spell a mark!
Tried a lot of stuff but... not working...
Can anyone help? Maybe a font... since the mark is ... the mark! i think i won't need a new lettering, i could use a font already made but... can anyone help?
