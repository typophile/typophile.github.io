body: "Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a type to go with
  a logo design.\r\n\r\nThe company is called Setfire Media, they are a web development
  company, who mainly create and maintain e-commerce sites. They are expanding rapidly
  and need to recruit both better clients and better staff. The main things they want
  the logo type to suggest are intelligence as well as a forward-looking attitude,
  without being boring. Any suggestions for type that would suit this?\r\n\r\nBtw,
  I know this is fairly vague, but any ideas would be of use I'm sure. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nSam\r\n"

    they may need more than a logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "Oof, I didn't explain that very well did I? Nevermind, branding work is almost
    finished now, I meant to come back here and correct any inevitable mistakes I
    made here, but I think i got swallowed up by deadlines. You can see the logo with
    the final type choice - Officina Sans, at the [[http://setfiremedia.com|holding
    page]].\r\n\r\nI think when I originally posted the comment, I meant to just get
    some broad ideas about typefaces as I was still drafting the logo design. Or something.
    Next time I'll try and be more lucid with my prose. "
