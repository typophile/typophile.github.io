body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kidd-luukko_4992.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis is the
  logo of a customer of mine. The design firm that created the logo only provided
  it to them in vector art and now they are out of business. We are trying to typeset
  to match and I am having ZERO luck trying to figure it out. Hope someone here can
  help!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!"

  body: "Agree with Raccardo on Segoe (Mono version [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/segoe-mono|here]]

    hardly squooshed; 2) Arial (not really inspired/inspiring); 3) basic (old-fashioned)
