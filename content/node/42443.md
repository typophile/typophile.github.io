  chef spezialising in Spanish paella. I am a little worried about the chef's hat,
  because of its colour. Any ideas? Thanks for any feedback...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo5_6504.png]"

  body: "I'm not digging the black outline. I also think the hat could have more detail
    to separate it from a piece of broccoli.\r\n\r\nOverall the direction, a chef's
    hat for a chef, seems a bit cliche."

  body: "Purely abstractly, I like the chef's hat, but due to the reasons picard mentions,
    it just doesn't work.  What about ingredients of Paella?  :)\r\n\r\nI like the
    type, and I think making a barely perceptible stroke for the letters would be
    better.\r\n\r\n(Didn't make the first post!  BTW, would love your thoughts on

  body: "First loose the stroke on the type. It will become a production problem when
    you use it at different sizes. Unless you want to spent a ton of time making rules
    for how thick the stroke is at different sizes. In general its just a bad idea.
    \r\n\r\nMy next question is are those Spanish colors? Look vaguely Italian to
    me.\r\n\r\nLastly open up the ro combination. Its the only combination that almost
    touches, it looks wrong. The el might be a tad to open as well. Good start keep
    going"

    El Bulli.  If you can find a shop that sells high-end cookbooks, go ask for everything
    by or associated with Ferran Adrian - the design on all their cookbooks & products
    is top-notch and very Spanish.  For Scream (who's doing stuff that's somewhat
    similar to El Bulli's approach to ice cream), I almost went with [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_letterine/|Letterine]]
    by the Italian type designer Alessio Leonardi. You might want to check out his
    website for his other faces.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "The more I look at it, the more the little chef's hat appears off-center
    to me.  It's driving me a little crazy - is it just me?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I would
    suggest that you use the paella as the inspiration for the design rather than
    the fact that Pedro is a chef.  I assume most people will assume that Pedro is
    the one who prepared the dish.  Paella is a such a fun thing to eat ... rice full
    of meaty prizes!!! Plus, typically when I have ordered it, it's for two, making
    it a social, even romantic, dish to eat.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I really like paella (obviously),
    but I still think that the dish is the core idea to drive the design."

  body: I like the new font, but I think the paella pan isn't working at that size
    - try it at a much smaller size, and then try color treatments for the name.  I
    also think that the lack of space looks to webby - no need for it, IMO!

  body: See if you can get  that looks slightly Arabic as well as Spanish, which could
    help channel southern Spain (especially Grenada). This specificity should help
    give a feel of authenticity.

    plates are really nice to look at, in fact I had a similar idea today when I found
    myself flipping through an Andalusian art book I found on my dad's bookshelf.
    However, since I'm not only developing the logo but also the website, I will probably
    use one of the historical patterns Scalfin proposed on the background and keep
    the logo rather simple like eeblet suggested. That should make both of you happy,
    no? I'll repost here in a few weeks, when I get on with the project. Thanks for
    your input!!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|WebDesign Portfolio]]"
