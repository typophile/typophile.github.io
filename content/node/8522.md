  but shaped more like Helvetica. <BR>I have heard there is a new family similar to
  this, does anyone have any ideas what it is called and where I could purchase it?

  body: Jill you might also look into is using your standard Helvetica and get a copy
    of Machine Wash by Mr. Retro. What it does is creates a layer mask in photoshop
    with its distressed look options. That the beauty of it because it doesn&#39;t
    actually destroy the type. So when your client changes a word, no problem.
