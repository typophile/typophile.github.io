body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was looking at both, they both seem pretty much the same design-wise
  (note that I haven't verified closely). I was wondering if any of you knew which
  one was best (not only design wise)? I'm not sure but it seems Bitstream's is a
  TTF in a OTF, whereas ITC's is a PS in OTF.\r\n\r\nAlso I was wondering what sans-serif
  you'd use with it, I was thinking maybe FF Scala Sans Pro since it has support for
  many languages, and a good range of features like Charter, and a design that would
  fit well I think. Only problem is that I cannot try it for real because the only
  font I have from both is Charis SIL (Charter clone) that lacks many of the features
  I want, but I thought some of you would know.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Pierre-Luc Auclair> I have wanted to know this very same information. Unfortunately,
    I do not have the answer. But generally speaking I have noticed ITC/Monotype to
    be more expensive than other distributors for a similar, if not the same product.\r\n\r\nIn
    this particular instance, I would go with Bitsteam on the basis of price. Charter
    BT PRO is $199 and ITC Charter Pro is $239. But I and you might too, be worried
    about proper kerning table programing and other technical considerations... I
    just don't know about that :-(\r\n\r\n{Compare Rotis from Linotype and Monotype}
    Letraset is another distributor that is about $20 more expensive for the same
    type.\r\n\r\nSorry I'm not very much help,\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "Charter started out as a Bitstream face and then was picked up by ITC.\r\n\r\nI
    did a detailed analysis of Charter years ago for a client and found that with
    the exception of the lowercase o, Charter shared a lot of the proportions of Joanna,
    or was well close.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Gill Sans will go well with Charter.\r\n\r\nJames"
