body: Hello dear typophiles. I'm working on a project for which I will have to design
  a bus schedule and I'm wondering whether there are fonts specifically designed for
  this kind of jobs or a well designed Myriad or Frutiger like fonts will work just
  fine. Thanks for your help and suggestions.

  body: "It depends on how small it will be printed, there are font (or font cuts)
    specifically designed for listings and long columns of tiny figures (sometimes
    called Agates). They\u2019re usually used in newspapers. H&FJ, Commercial Type,
    and Font Bureau, among others, have them.\r\nOne feature you could find useful
    would be tabular figures with the same metrics in any style or weight (so that,
    for example, an italic or bold number will still vertically align with the regular
    one placed above or below)."

  body: "Good advice.\r\nAlso, look for non-grotesque styles, because 3, 6, 8 and
    9 in that genre are too similar.\r\nAnd, make sure that descenders are short (which
    is often the case in fonts with large x-heights), this will enable you to minimize
    leading.\r\nIMO, the lining \u201Cone\u201D glyph in tabular fonts should always
    have a foot crossbar.\r\n\r\nArguably the most legible of such styles is Bell
    Centennial, so you could use that as a benchmark and see how far away from its
    hyper readability you are prepared to depart in the name of style.\r\n\r\nMy best
    agate-for-tables type: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sense/\">Sense</a>."
