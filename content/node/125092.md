  a notepad inspired by the design and typography of the classic Mac OS. \r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate feedback,\r\nespecially if you got any additional information or
  resources on the Chicago Typeface by Susan Kare that you think could or should be
  added - I would be very thankful.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/cancel-save-notepad/description\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/cancel-save-notepad/description</a></strong>\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nHarald"
