body: "I've recently started playing around with ambigrams, and the first one that
  really worked for me was---fortuitously---my girlfriend's name.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure
  if it's readable though (since I know what it says, I'm a terrible judge). There
  are, no doubt, some aesthetic improvements to be made too, but if you can read it,
  that's a good start."

    top of the y a bit by moving the loop left a bit? I think the y is the most illegible
    letter."
