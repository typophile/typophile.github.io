body: "I was wondering if anyone knew the typeface used in the West Side Story logo.
  Is it a true stencil font, is it an altered typeface or has it been constructed
  from scratch? I assume that the distressing has been done after the fact...\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks to all."

  body: "That looks like the original logo, which was done in the 50's, before digital
    type.I always assumed it was hand-drawn to resemble the stenciling sometimes seen
    on buildings (presumably in the West Side of Manhattan).\r\n\r\nI seems like it
    could be easy enough to fake the same look with fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "My guess is that the designer started out with wood type, which was enjoying
    a revival of popularity at that time. If so, the distressing might be genuine.
    \r\nThe \"stencil\" lines are too thin to have been functional in a real stencil,
    but the designer may have added them to suggest the stencilled labels on packing
    crates at the docks along the Hudson River. "

  body: 'It looks like an original logo and distressing design is genuine and original.  The
    stencil lines are probably places to create a balance which seemed to be appropriate
    that the dancing male and female doesn''t look like they''re floating.  '
