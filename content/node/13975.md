body: "Thought this might be of interest to history buffs.\r\nI recently unearthed
  several samples sheets (very poor copies of original) from one of Lanston Monotype's
  promotional pieces from 1924.\r\n\r\nIt's for <em>Italian Old Style</em> by Frederic
  W. Goudy, with specimen samples of the Roman and Italic faces, and a <a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/Aimages/Ital-OS_prices.jpg\"
  target=\"new\"><strong>price sheet</strong></a> for type caster matrices.\r\n\r\nThis
  PDF includes the <a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/Aimages/ITALIAN_.pdf\" target=\"new\"><strong>Italian
  Old Style</strong></a> cover, Roman & Italic specimens and price sheet.\r\n\r\nThe
  only digitized version I found available is <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=202522\"
  target=\"new\">Monotype Italian Old Style Roman</a> which differs in many respects,
  sort of sterilized, like they took the <em>Italian</em> out.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=202523\">Italic</a>
  is altogether different from Goudy's version, very much like a standard italic afterthought.\r\n\r\nMonotype
  also added a bold and bold italic weight, though Goudy only designed a Roman and
  Italic.\r\n\r\nIt seems that <a href=\"http://www.lanstontype.com/Giampa/Goudy-Type-Face-List.html\"
  target=\"new\">The Lanston Type Company</a> has Italian Old Style on their list
  of Goudy designs to digitize in the future... let's hope they do.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
  I\u2019m old, but so what!"

  body: Even better news... The price of the complete Italian Oldstyle equipment from
    1924 <a href="http://eh.net/hmit/compare/result.php?use%5B%5D=DOLLAR&use%5B%5D=GDPDEFLATION&use%5B%5D=UNSKILLED&use%5B%5D=GDPCP&use%5B%5D=NOMINALGDP&amount2=740&year2=1924&year_result=&amount=&year_source=">adjusted
    for inflation in 2003</a> is more than double what we will end up charging for
    LTC Italian Oldstyle. Order early and we will only charge 1/4 that price.

  body: "Wow!\r\nSo $740.00 from 1924 is roughly worth $7,982.71 for the font family
    using the Consumer Price Index.\r\nAnd we thought things were cheaper in the <em>good
    ol' days</em>.\r\n\r\nPaul, the colophon is great and shows real promise on the
    revival of Lanston's Italian Old Style (and ornaments?). Does anyone know why
    Monotype Italian Old Style turned out looking so <em>non-Italian</em>?\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, and like my Italians Old Style!"
