  build all latin characters.\r\n\r\nThere are some characters i fell in love with
  like a, e, g, y, x ... \r\nbut there are some few characters where i have some problems.
  ... s, S, z, Z, L, F, E\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can give me a good hint.\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/black_test_4012.png]\r\n"

  body: "Very good stuff.\r\n\r\nThere are a few parts that are unexpectedly thin
    and could be thickened, like the joins of g, the curled terminal point of g and
    Q, and the crossbar of H.\r\n\r\nThe key to improving s,S,z,Z may be to remember
    that the bottom does not have to be the same as the top.\r\n\r\nT is unique in
    its lack of softness. The bottom should probably be rounded. If you can't find
    a different solution to the straight flat top of T, you might distribute that
    flatness to a few other letters like L and Z so it is not alone. But E and F look
    good to me as they are."

    numerals. Already not perfekt but i can work on it for the whole next 2 Days.
    I think i can show some more after that. Here is the status quo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/erste_promo_blog_black_02_6025.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/erste_promo_blog_black_03_5570.png]"

  body: "Yes, you are right\r\nI fixed the i and j. First i tried just a circular
    dot but this didn't work. Now it's more squarish.\r\nI also fixed the top of g
    and made it a little bit bigger.\r\n\r\nThe punctuation and diacritics are the
    next topics right now. I'm thinking right now of the period, maybe i'll make it
    more squarish, too. Like the i and j dot's.\r\nDollar, Euro and Ampersand have
    to be reworked. There are too many differences when i compare them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/erste_promo_blog_04_3861.jpg]"

  body: 'kxarPX seem too wide and ftM too narrow. But of course, I may be wrong. the
    dots may be too close to the letters too. Why don''t you use the same top as on
    the original E and F for the T? The original E and F look faaaaaaaaar better!
    Check some serifs like on d: is it really facing the direction you want? '

  body: "Wow. On it's way to sexiness. I like.\r\n\r\nThis may be completely subjective,
    but I think the letter S is naturally one of the most sexy, appealing letters
    of all, in any typeface. Yours however feels a little too quirky and awkward,
    compared to what you've achieved in the rest of the face. The z, & and $ might
    be in the same boat. I think you are closer in other triple-tiered miniscule letters
    (a & e). Your \"g' however is verging on fantastic!\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth!
    I love where you are going with it. Keep it up, please!"

  body: "Is /a/ too wide?\r\n\r\nHook and crossbar of /f/ might need clearer definition
    somehow.\r\n\r\nThe shapes of the whites in /S/ and /s/ are now better, but both
    letters look too thin in the spine to me.\r\n\r\n/K/ may be too close to /H/.\r\n\r\n/M/
    looks backwards (flipped horizontally) to me.\r\n\r\nThe figures look simpler
    than the letters - almost like a different font. At least consider adding a serify
    bump to the top terminal of /5/.\r\n\r\nThe section mark looks too black. /#/
    probably too. The copyright is terrific! I like the asterisk too.\r\n\r\nI agree
    that flipping the top serif of /d/ to the other side is worth trying.\r\n\r\nKeep
    up the good work."
