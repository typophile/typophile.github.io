    is a beautiful classic typeface; Optima Nova is a business decision."

    (or \u201Cchirographic\u201D) influence in type design for personal reasons along
    with your advice? You know, someone might not agree with you. At the very least,
    they should know why you think it is a bad idea."

  body: "Another Optima alternative that a really like is [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/mentor_sans_pro_volume/|Mentor
    Sans]], particularly the bold. Where Optima has a wonderful classical stateliness
    and elegance, Mentor Sans has a briskness and vigor and strength that is wonderful
    in its own distinctive way. By contrast, to me most Optima variants look like
    they're trying to be Optima and failing. \r\n\r\nBy the way I like both the old
    and new versions of Optima by Zapf, except for the condensed, which to me is a
    betrayal of the concept, with the wide, elegant classical arches.  "

  body: "<em>Optima Nova is a business decision.</em>\r\n\r\nNew weights and features
    were necessary for today\u2019s font usage, but it seems to me that redesigning
    key glyphs such as /a and /c and making a \u201Cproper\u201D italic were done
    to provide a clearly visible difference to potential purchasers, despite the fact
    that the original design is best."

    is a gutsy, non-business move because I believe they probably <em>lost</em> customers
    to it, and they knew that would happen.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
