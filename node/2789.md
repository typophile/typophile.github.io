  body: That sure looks very close to me!  For comparison I took BJ&#39;s suggestion
    and looked at Scriptorium&#39;s collection. This was the closest I found &#40;Allembert&#41;.

  body: The E from the &#34;Scriptorium Allembert&#34; font would go well to replace
    the &#39;E&#39; in the &#39;Mael&#39; font. Now, the mystery of the &#39;N&#39;
    needs to be solved.

    little illustrator work...
