  body: "I'm sorry but that's really too close to Stratum 2 not to be it, indeed customized
    but still Stratum 2. All earmarks and positions look present to me: flat /M centre
    vertex and position, /S design shape, rounded corner bowls, /A crossbar position...
    Only differences are some rounded corners (obviously done by hand) and /E middle
    crossbar reduced.\r\nAnother options: HFF [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/industry|Industry]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/industry-inc|Industry
