  inspired by the film titles of [[http://annyas.com/screenshots/updates/imitation-of-life-1959-douglas-sirk-lana-turner-john-gavin-sandra-dee/|Imitation
  of Life]]. The aanyas.com site is a great source of inspiration.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  looking,\r\nDave"

  body: "Not bad!\r\nThe alternates are really effective and the joins seamless.\r\nHowever,
    you might consider adding a high-res/display version.\r\nVeneer is a marked improvement
    over Anodyne, for example.\r\nFor glamour, one can never be too \uFB01ne.\r\nAs
    an aside, it would be interesting to know which Olicana has been more successful,
    rough or smooth.\r\n"

    you mean a higher contrast version or more detail in terms of the roughness of
    the outlines? I tried to keep the outlines smooth to give a wet paint sort of
    feel, but I suppose a rougher edge could also be nice. I might give it a try."

    cut could/should have a higher contrast too."

  body: "If brushstrokes are being represented, there\u2019s no reason why the strokes
    can\u2019t taper off to really \uFB01ne, as in the <em>Imitation of Life</em>
    titles that you linked to\u2014and that would increse the contrast. Actually,
    that does occur in some letters already. Also, by spacing out the strokes you
    have lightened the overall effect of the original, reducing contrast."

  body: Hi Nick - in answer to your question, as you may have guessed; Smooth, followed
    by Fine then Rough.

  body: Nick (Cooke), do you make the rough first and smooth it, or the smooth first
    then roughen it?

  body: The Rough was the first as it was my actual handwriting. Then I drew the Smooth
    from scratch. I wouldn't do a 'roughed-up' style as I don't find those filters
    very convincing - too evenly rough if you know what I mean.
