    I hope it will return shortly.\r\nI agree that a link to the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/moderators\">moderators\u2019
    page</a> or another possibility of contacting them should be present on every
    page."

  body: A flag option could definitely be useful, but it needs to be implemented really
    carefully. Such features are often the target of much abuse. And besides, who
    is really bothered by a little ad hominem in a forum post? I couldn't be bothered
    less to be honest.

  body: Bump. For now reserve flagging just for spam and call the option "Flag as
    spam" or simply "Spam". There is a number of threads in General Discussion that
    could really use it <em>right now</em>.
