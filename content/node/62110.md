  that the American price for the CD is $2,599 (=EUR 1,764) \r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/fontfolio/\r\nand
  the Dutch (since I'm from the Netherlands) price is EUR 3,643.78.\r\nhttps://store5.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-NL&event=displayProduct&categoryPath=/Applications/FontFolio&distributionMethod=FULL\r\n\r\n-
  Does anybody know the reason of this difference?\r\n- Is it legel to use the American
  version?\r\n\r\nthanks a lot,\r\nJeroen"

    more in some countries because people are willing to pay more (although in some
    cases in also has to do with the oddities of currency markets), even discounting
    VAT taxes. Australia and Japan also have inflated prices for many goods. But go
    shopping outside of touristy neighborhoods in Mexico and even the USA looks expensive!"

    (as far as apps go at least, not fonts, of course)."

  body: 'The price of something in a particular market is determined in part by ability
    and willingness to pay, which is why the Internet might function as a global delivery
    system but not as a global market: ability and willingness to pay remain regional.
    Companies like Adobe have European marketing and sales staff or associates, and
    they determine the price for the local market, based on their experience of what
    buyers in that market are able and willing to pay. Sure, not everyone in any market
    is able or willing to pay the asking price, but the pricing is based on maintaining
    some number of sales in given time period. If not enough sales are made, the price
    will go down, but as long as the product is selling at the current price that
    price will be maintained or may go up. It may seem unfair that people in North
    America pay less for a lot of things, but then it seems unfair to a lot of us
    that Europeans get such long holidays.'
