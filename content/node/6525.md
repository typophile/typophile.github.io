    anybody! :-/ <BR>Anyway, all I have to say is: Finally!! And it&#39;s wonderful.
    And Keith&#39;s has an austere elegance. <BR>Plus the bit about mixing Unger&#39;s
    fonts with Chinese &#40;on Unger&#39;s site, actually&#41; is genial. <BR> <BR>hhp

    but now I can throw up a  <BR>link to Unger too. You rule.

  body: Actually I guess your right. From an academic point of view, it would be extremely
    interesting. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s just that... <BR> <BR>well... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not that fond of his type designs. I really dislike some of his trademark curves
    and design details, and never use any of his fonts, although I own a nice selection
    of licenses through the Bitstream Full Library CD-ROM. I must admit I never had
    the chance to play around with Zapfino, though, maybe that could change my mind.

    more on it... I&#39;ve put together some photos of vernacular type/lettering that
    I took in Hong Kong three years ago, and planning a gallery of the Cooper type
    &#40;excuse me, but I think it&#39;s actually a beautiful type... &#41;. Hopefully
    I&#39;ll get those finished by the start of next week. Watch this space!

  body: Talking about Optima, I saw the article on the new Optima Next in <i>Step</i>
    magazine... haven&#39;t had time to read the actual article yet, but I saw the
    illustrations... Apparently Zapf is working with Kobayashi on it. Guss what they
    are doing to it? Rounded corners &#40;in the counters&#41;! And oblique-cut terminals!
    Sheared corners! If you already have problems with the original Optima &#40;which
    I don&#39;t really&#41;, how about this cute and cuddly version, eh?

  body: 'I read that article a couple of days ago: it&#39;s mostly predictable fluff,
    although the large glyphs were nice. I noticed that the shears seem to have been
    applied well, and that probably took them a while, assuming they didn&#39;t use
    some custom Python script or something, which of course is the only smart way
    to do it!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, did you guys know &#34;Zapf has never used a
    computer&#34;? <BR>Funny, since he&#39;s no Luddite; think of the Hz spacing stuff.

  body: Hrant, sorry for my ignorance, what are/how do you use Python scripts? I assume
    they are scripts for automating type design... Can I use them with FontLab or
    are they RoboFOG only? I guess Zapf is more of a calligrapher. But that does surprise
    me... yeah, how does he explain that Hz spacing stuff?! <BR> <BR>K.

  body: 'I&#39;m only warming up to Python scripting myself. It&#39;s basically a
    way to &#34;algorithmize&#34; tasks. <BR> <BR>Like for the shearing you might
    say: <BR>1. Go around the outline point by point. <BR>2. When you find an acute
    angle of less than 30 degrees&#42;: put two new points on either side of the point
    in question, 2 ems away; dump the original point and connect the two new ones.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; The shear threshold recommended by Doyald Young. <BR> <BR>So you
    run the script and BAM! in a second you&#39;ve done the work of a full day. Both
    RoboFog and FontLab support Python scripting, although I don&#39;t think the code
    is portable. BTW, now that FontLab is so powerful, I don&#39;t see much room left
    for RoboFog. <BR> <BR>&#62; how does he explain that Hz spacing stuff?! <BR> <BR>You
    mean in terms of doing it without a computer? I guess the same way he explains
    Optima Next: he sits there and talks, and somebody else &#34;codifies&#34; things.
    Either that or he&#39;s got a next-generation voice-command system... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Well, Hrant, that would depend on which CLK font&#40;s&#41;. Well, I know
    Hiroshige is the name of a Japanese printmaker, but I don&#39;t think it has much
    Asian characteristics really. I tend to think that Latin types that have distinctively
    calligraphic influences might not work so well... What&#39;s your take on it?

  body: '&#62; CLK <BR> <BR>Was that a Daimler Freudian slip? <BR> <BR>I guess Hiroshige
    is a subtley faux orientalesque face? Well, my aversion to calligraphic type is
    no secret, but I can&#39;t deny that some oriental types are strongly calligraphic,
    and with those maybe it would work? Dunno. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Oops... Remember when Apple used to have these &#39;language kits&#39; for
    the System 7? I used to refer to the Chinese Language Kit as CLK... Of course
    that&#39;s history now. Daimler Freudian?! <BR> <BR>&#62; I guess Hiroshige is
    a subtley faux orientalesque face? <BR> <BR>Maybe. But to me it&#39;s more like
    Western calligraphy. Oh yes, a lot of CJK fonts are unmistakably calligraphic,
    but I think it is awkward to combine Western and Eastern calligraphic type like
    that, because they are based on fundamentally distinct principles and traditions.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m cooking up some articles on Chinese typography at the moment...
    I&#39;ll let you know as soon as they go live. <BR> <BR>K.
