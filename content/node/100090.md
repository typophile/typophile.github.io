  building my resume and my personal logo is written in Bodoni Std Roman. I'm looking
  for something clean and simple, yet stylish to go with it in the body. I was thinking
  Avenir Roman. \r\n\r\nAm I better off with something like Helvetica? I appreciate
  any help. Thanks!"

  body: How much and how small is the text? I don't think Avenir nor Helvetica are
    particularly good for reading at small sizes, which is often what I encounter
    in resumes.

      appreciate any suggestions you may have.

  body: "Unless you're applying for graphic design jobs, \"stylish\" should not IMHO
    be one of the top adjectives on your mind.  \"Clean and simple\", though, yes.\r\n\r\nLast
    year I attended a lecture by a professional resume counselor.  His advice was
    to be as orthodox as possible in the use of resume fonts.  I believe he said something
    to the effect of, \"when I see a resume done up in beautiful fonts, my first thought
    is: what is this person trying to distract me from?\"\r\n\r\nBy all means, choose
    something that looks crisp and professional (just not too <em>overtly</em> elegant).
    \ If you're aiming for 9-10pt, use something that is highly readable at that size
    as well.  (My own current go-to fonts for that kind of work are Sabon and Janson
    Text, although I'm not sure they'd combine well with Bodoni.  Are you set on using
    a sans-serif?)"

    that I (legally) know of. And a friendly word of advice. I would be <em><strong>very</strong></em>
    careful when enquiring about free fonts in the future, lest you attract a significant

  body: I believe a version of Bodoni comes with Office 2010, so from a certain perspective
    it may at least count as "no additional cost" (which is what most casual speakers
    probably mean by "free")...

  body: Right on. And apologies if it seemed like I asked for a free font or, worse,
    suggested pirating. I've been saving my money for buying Bodoni amongst others,
    so it was more an exclamation of surprise of the comment regarding the "free option"
    Bodoni-logo than anything else. But yes, I see the point of watching out saying
    "free font" at all, I'm very much aware it's a sore point :)
