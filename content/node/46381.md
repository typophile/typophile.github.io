  same distinctive theme song. The contract with it's composer was due for renewal.
  She and her management firm were asking more than the CBC, a public broadcaster
  was willing to pay. In steps CTV, a private television network and pays $3,000,000
  for complete ownership with the intention of using it as the theme for their Wednesday
  night hockey show.\r\n \r\nThe theme has become iconic in Canada - If you don't
  know the tune, you probably are not a Canadian. It's so strongly identified with
  the CBC's Hockey Night in Canada that when the possibility came up that CBC could
  lose the rights to it, that was <b>THE</b> headline story in this country for at
  least a week, pushing aside war, murder and mayhem. We're talking music here, but
  really it was a question of branding. As in, \"who owns this thing and what does
  ownership mean?\" It's been around so long people feel a sense of ownership towards
  the tune. can it really belong to the people who paid for the rights, or is it even
  truly \"ownable\" ?\r\n \r\nPerhaps an analogy would be if Michelin's fat-tire-guy
  went to work for Goodyear he'd still be selling Michelin tires for years to come
  and there would be nothing Goodyear could do about it. How long before people watching
  Hockey on CTV will hear the theme and not think, \"Oh yeah - CBC Hockey Night in
  Canada - Saturday - <em>Must watch...</em>\" ?"

    game all the way... I could care less about that part of the story. I just thought
    from a branding point of view it was a dumb move on CTV's part.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    her agent is too, I imagine.....  "
