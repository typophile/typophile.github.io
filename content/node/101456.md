body: "I've been trying to look for this font for ages.\r\nThe first time I saw it
  was in a title card in an animated series, and I thought that it was custom made,
  and thus impossible to find on the Internet, but not very long ago, I found it used
  in a bar's facade, which led me to think that it was a pre-existing font.\r\n\r\nThe
  font was white with a black outline, but the TV version had some kind of \"reflections\".
  You'll understand better if you look at the image. However, the version I saw in
  the bar (which I assume is the original font) didn't have them.\r\n\r\nThe top image
  is one of the title cards I first saw the font in, and the bottom part is my own
  (badly-made, I know) recreation of the original look of the font, without the \"reflections\"
  seen in the first one, just as I saw it in the bar.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thanks in
  advance ^^"

  body: "Wow, thanks! It certainly looks like it, even more when I look at number
    5, which I also have a sample of.\r\nI've looked at [[http://www.identifont.com/show?BDR|American
    Uncial (Mecanorma)]], following your suggestions, and I think it must be this
    one.\r\n\r\nSo thanks again for having found it!\r\n\r\nDo you know if there is
    any version of it with the outlining? I know that the reflections were custom-made
    for TV, but the version I saw in the bar had exactly the same outlining, which
    isn't just in the outside borders of the font, but also in some inside parts (for
    example, A or T)."

  body: "Official statement: I love you both.\r\n\r\nThe only problem there is is
    that while American Uncial has an international character set, Kelt Caps Freehand
    does not. I was specifically looking for a Spanish character set (whose only differences
    with the English one are the \xC1\xC9\xCD\xD3\xDA, the letter \xD1 and the \xBF
    and \xA1 symbols) but I think that with a bit of playing around with the font
    and having a look at my source material, I'll be able to make them.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thanks!"
