body: I was talking about athletics with a friend recently and how one day there would
  have to be an unbeatable world record - no furter improvement possible. <BR> <BR>In
  terms of readability in typography, is a similar limit conceivable? What would happen
  if we reached that limit? Would we even know?  <BR> <BR>Matha.

    Sprint</a> yet? <BR> <BR>Personally I&#39;d like to see a Punchcutting Race next
    time, resulting in an Open Type font of course <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'How could there be an &#34;unbeatable&#34; record in athletics? For one thing,
    mutation still happens. <BR> <BR>Readability: It&#39;s a dynamic thing &#40;even
    if you took some &#34;average&#34; of all readers&#41;, and familiarity does play
    a role. In my Alphabet Reform work I arrived at the conclusion that the degree
    to which an alphabet &#40;nevermind a font, which is an instance of an alphabet&#41;
    is optimal depends on the current state of the reader. What I mean for example
    is that an &#34;e&#34; with a flat bottom might improve readability optimally
    at this time &#40;by pushing the boundary just the right amount&#41;, but once
    people are totally comfortable with that structure the next step in optimization
    might be to give the &#34;e&#34; a descender. <BR> <BR>This is hard to explain.

    minutes and seconds are. <BR>&#40;I don&#39;t beleive the unbeatable athletics
    record either, evolution will sort it out.&#41;
