body: "I use my computer a lot, and initially used the touchpad for years with no
  problem, then the tip of my finger started to get sensitive. So I switched to a
  roller ball, then my thumb started to get sore from doing the left click. Then I
  went to a regular mouse and the back of my hand is feeling like the nerves are getting
  tweaked.\r\n\r\nArthritic? sensitivity pretty much took me out of playing music
  a couple years ago. (and the missing $8K a year I used to pick up on weekends has
  seriously eroded my fun/pocket money)\r\n\r\nIn considering a long term solution
  to this situation, I got the bright idea of a tablet/pen solution. Has anyone used
  one enough to develop any hand problems with one?\r\n\r\nAnd what of the Cintiq
  screenpad? It looks really cool, although the price is a bit scary. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.wacom.com/cintiq/\r\n"

  body: "When I try using tablets for extended periods I just end up with different
    aches and pains than I get from using mice, trackballs, and so on. You know how
    if you sit at a drawing table for hours your arms cramp and your lower back hurts?
    It\u2019s the same if you use a tablet. Also, tablets are a huge PITA for setting
    type and dealing with vectors, because it detects the stylus even at short distances
    from the screen, which screws up your ability to just instantly click and/or release.
    \r\n\r\nThe only good solution to the repetitive motion problems that I have found
    to work is spending time at the gym. Even just loosening up my arms by doing cardio
    on an eliptical trainer makes a big difference, and weight training all but erases
    the pain and numbness. Before you drop the money on a Cintiq, try getting a pair
    of running shoes and a set of dumbbells. "

  body: A friend of mine has a cintiq and as far as I can judge (i'm only 20 years
    old), it is far less repetitive as a mouse. But it takes some getting used to,
    works a bit slower (I'm used to a lasermouse) but is really precise. I don't know
    if it works with fontlab though. My friend is mostly an illustrator.

  body: "I think the key is if you have problems is to not rely on one input device
    alone. Switch amongst them to avoid the repetition of using one device day in
    and day out.\r\n\r\nThe Cintiq is kind of interesting in that we've come full-circle.
    Anyone remember the laser-pens circa APPLE II era?\r\n\r\nThat said, at $2500,
    I'd also look into the tablet laptops that allow direct drawing on screen too.
    The only catch is that those might depend on specific software."

    is a VAR that is modifying MacBooks and mounting Cintiq-like tablets in place
    of their monitors. Give me a minute and I'll post a link to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:

  body: "Thanks for the input. A Wacom pad is what I will probably add to the mix
    next, and see how that goes. \r\n\r\nThe suggestion to work out at the gym is
    probably good, but the last time I went on a workout streak, I went from XL to
    XXL. I have noticed the fashion options are even more limited at XXXL, so I will
    try not to get carried away. \r\n\r\nWhich reminds me, those pants manufacturers
    are starting to get chintzey with the cloth. Some sort of evil cabal has been
    formed to try and get me to think I am no longer a 36\" waist. But I digress...\r\n;
