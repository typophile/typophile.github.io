Dick, this seems to be the first occasion that you apparently linked to a pirated font on Typophile*. I truly appreciate that you seem to no longer do that, but I'm curious: why and when did you stop? You don't have to reply - I know it was a while back.

* Here are a couple more:

Go to dinner. 
Visit with the family. 
Get a girl friend.
Get a boy friend.
Make a font. 
------------
Mr Moderator: You have to admit, Hrant's continuing actions are extreme harassment and should be cause for disbarment! 

Do we need any more proof that he is acting as an internet troll.  [[http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/weirdwebculture/f/what-is-an-internet-troll.htm]]

"The Sad Truths of Internet Trolls:
1.	Trolls enjoy using shock-value statements to get angry responses from others.
2.	Trolls gain energy by you insulting them.
3.	Trolls gain energy when you get angry.
4.	Trolls are immune to criticism and logical arguments. True trolls cannot be reasoned with, regardless of how sound your logical argument is.
5.	Trolls do not feel remorse like you and me. They have sociopathic tendencies, and accordingly, they delight in other people having hurt feelings.
6.	Trolls consider themselves separate from the social order. 
7.	Trolls do not abide by etiquette or the rules of common courtesy.
8.	Trolls consider themselves above social responsibility.
9.	The only way to deal with a troll is to ignore him, or take away his ability to post online."

AND:

"How Exactly Do Internet Trolls Abuse Others?

Ans: Internet trolls seek to be disruptive and hurtful by using any of the following techniques: 
1.	Trolls will post abusive and hurtful comments directed at a specific person (aka "flaming" another person)
2.	Trolls will incite broad arguments and provoke angry responses by making controversial statements. (e.g. racism, religious intolerance, bigoted or elitist views, mysogyny, extreme political views)
3.	Trolls will narcissistically dominate conversations, trying to make themselves the center of attention. (e.g. nonstop comments about themselves and their accomplishments; repeated self-centered statements and bragging)
4.	Trolls will start many off-topic threads, seeking to derail users from the focus of an online community."

FINALLY:

"Why Do People Enjoy Being Internet Trolls?

Ans: it is a kind of power rush or ego trip to be a troll. Being online is a place that is largely free of perceived consequences... an insecure person can get a sense of power online, without ever having to face someone directly. With the Internet being a world of imagination and fantasy for some, cowardly users can forge an alter ego for themselves, and act out their feelings of anger and inadequacy. It's sad and unfortunate that our advanced communications also brings out the darker side of many people."

Quod erat demonstratum.

I feel you're the one who needs to be disciplined for these personal attacks, your previous promotion of pirated fonts (unless you apologized and I missed it - it's never too late, and to me it's entirely forgivable) as well as your provocative anti–type-designer statements here:
http://typophile.com/node/5390#comment-38820

That said, I won't make a public stink if you stay - I try to be a tolerant, inclusive person. You should note that I haven't attacked you in over three weeks, and I have no intention of reverting to attacks.

		<div class="commentbody">Dick, how is it an attack to mention something <em>public</em> that <em>you</em> did -furthermore kindly thanking you for no longer doing it- in order to get a better grasp of how Typophile handles such cases? Because I've never been in such a situation myself, so I lack the experience. Do you perhaps feel attacked because you're embarrassed of it yourself? Note that I made no such value judgment myself. And FWIW, I believe everybody makes mistakes, and if they express remorse they should be forgiven. But that's just me - nobody has to follow suit.

In contrast, you called me a sociopath, insecure and a coward.

And in that other thread I referenced, you basically stated that anybody making money from fonts is a plagiarist. You further imply that nobody should pay for fonts. To me that all constitutes a "massively parallel" personal attack against hundreds of people who are Typophile's raison d'être.

But I personally don't hold grudges, and remain open to any corrective efforts.
