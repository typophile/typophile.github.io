body: "I am typesetting business cards and have come across a small problem. A person's
  name is Illingworth, and they specifically requested an \"I\" with serifs so one
  can differentiate it from the double L that follows. How would you go about doing
  this?\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I tried leaving it in Univers and just adjusting the kerning
  between the I and double L.</li>\r\n<li>I reluctantly tried reducing the vertical
  height of the double L, but ran into problems with the lowercase i that follows
  (Illingworth)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAlthough the I is slightly thicker than a lowercase
  L, I certainly understand why this person would be annoyed, but I'm kind of at a
  loss. Here is how the kerning looks. \r\n\r\n(Top = normal; bottom = kerned.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/problem_3962.jpg]"

  body: "Use a character from a font with serifed I, such as Verdana. If the weight
    and height aren't quite right, adjust them with horizontal and vertical scaling.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    choose a sans font which has some contrast between I and l, either with caps that
    clearly have a greater stem width, or one where ascenders are taller than cap
    height."

  body: I would try simply raising the ascender line by just outlining the type and
    using the Direct Selection Tool to raise the two l's, i, t and h playing with
    different variations. It shouldn't be too difficult to arrive at a solution that
    differentiates the double l problem, although it will inherently be more subtle
    than that of a serif. Just look at some other sans that have more extreme ascender
    heights for comparison.

  body: "I would just go and make the cap I a tiny bit smaller (basically what Nick
    said in his 2nd sentence, assuming you HAVE to use Univers.)\r\nNice example BTW!
    :)"

  body: Thanks for the feedback. I will try decreasing the cap height. Not sure why
    I didn't try that in the first place!
