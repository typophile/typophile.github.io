body: "I am currently trying to recreate two logos from a client who is only able
  to supply TIF files, the image quality of both logos is not great and they have
  been of no help in regards to sourcing an EPS or better quality logo.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem I find myself in is they are now wanting their logo to appear on a large
  plastic bag, so I will have to recreate them as EPS files in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could assist with identifying the font from the images below it would be
  greatly appreciated. I think the text \"Radiology\" is in Myriad Pro or something
  similar but the font above it has me stumped...\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and
  look forward to some replies (and hopefully a solution) :-)\r\n\r\nRegards, Shaun

  body: "Aakash, you may be right about the second font being customized, but if so
    it is very well done, I think. I believe it seems too well designed to be just
    a customization, but I have not been able to match it. The closest I found were
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cepuertas/urbana/\">Urbana</a> from Cesar
    Puertas, and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/henning-skibbe/haptic-pro/\">Haptic</a>
    from Henning Skibbe. Both have tapered stems, and a similar soft feel, but they
    do not have the rounded serifs on the 'a' and 'c'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for replying - I managed to locate a PDF file of the Annual Report
    from the company that the logo relates to. Luckily there were some logos in vector
    based format. I still do not know the name of the font but since I have a decent
    version of the logo now you could say that this one is solved!\r\n\r\nThanks again
    to those that took the time to reply. :-)"
