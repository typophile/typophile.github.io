  body: "A 19th century serif style called Detroit or mansard. The lowercase of Outstanding
    by \"bobistheowl\" is in the ballpark for CRUZAN [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OutstandingLCAsCRUZAN_3633.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/outstanding.font?text=cruzan&psize=l\r\nMore
    info by Luc Devroye http://luc.devroye.org/bobistheowl.html\r\nOutstanding is
    based on Big Vintage Letters by Big Letters Org http://bigletters.org/big-decorative-vintage-letters.html
    With some digging it might be possible to find the original 19th century source.
    \r\nNote that the Outstanding font has awkward sizing. Resize the glyphs to about
    40% and they work much better. \r\nRelatively minor editing of Outstanding could
    produce a pretty close facsimile of CRUZAN.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
