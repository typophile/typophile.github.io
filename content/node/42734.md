  fonts into different folder - postscript, .dfonts etc. \r\n\r\nBut I have discovered
  I have two different types of OTF and don't know which to use. For instance, one
  will have the green and black O symbol, the .otf suffix yet be listed as TrueType
  font under kind, then I have another sort which has the F on a grey block symbol
  with OTF underneath it, and be listed under kind as OpenType font. \r\n\r\nAs I'm
  trying to streamline my fonts, I want to amalgamate all into one OTF folder so want
  to go with the best ones. Does it matter which ones I choose?"

  body: "OK now I'm really confused... I have a folder which I've called TTF (true
    type fonts) and within I have a font called Arial Black.ttf. It has the F symbol,
    and it listed as Windows true type font under kind. Yet when I drop this font
    into FontExplorer it says the format is Opentype and the symbol has changed to
    the green and black O.\r\n\r\nI don't understand!"

    look for the font with the higher version number.\r\n\r\n<cite>I don\u2019t understand!</cite>\r\n\r\nAgain,
    nothing to worry about. A TrueType font and an OpenType font with TrueType outlines
    is basically the same thing. If you wan't to sort your fonts by format, you might
    want to separate old PostScript Type1 fonts and everything that is called TrueType
    or OpenType. But there is no need to have folders like \"ttf\" or \"otf\". "
