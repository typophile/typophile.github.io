  on a PC by publishing date and/or some kind of regional influence. What would that
  program be called?

    you talking about <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2393/fontexplorer.html\">Font
    Explorer</a> (FE)? Not to be confused with the rather new FontExplorer X (FEX)!
    The former can\r\n<cite>[f]ind fonts fitting each historical era</cite> and <cite>[s]elect
    a mix of emotions and impressions and find the fonts that suit them all</cite>.\r\n\r\nYet,
    I don\u2019t think this app is suited for <em>managing</em> fonts. For that, the
    latter is the right thing \u2013 however the Windows version of that is currently
    not available due to revision.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/15290?\">FAQ
    on the Best Font Management</a>.\r\n\r\nThough there are tags like \u2018designer\u2019
    or \u2018description\u2019 in FEX, you have to do the sorting yourself, I\u2019m
    afraid."

    sort your font into folders by hand, then drop them into the program, which will
    treat them as sets...If you go with fe x be sure to uncheck the "manage font files"
    option at the advanced preference panel...'

    or desirable to rename file names?'

    cause serious problems with your pc.
