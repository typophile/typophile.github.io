  no training in design/aesthetics.  Can you please give me your criticism on a logo
  I'm playing around with for my new venture?\r\n\r\nI looking for a logo that is
  clean and simple (many clients use English as a 2nd language), yet indicates achievement
  (particularly scholastic achievement).\r\n\r\nPlease be brutally honest, but dumb
  down any specialized vocabulary for this novice.  In particular, are there any rules
  for character spacing and sizing?  It seems I have a lot of problems in that area.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n\r\nEMS"

  body: "Before I start with the typography I'd suggest you to rework the star. It
    has some problems concerning consistency. Some of which are falling into the Gestalt
    Principles. Learn about them at http://www.andyrutledge.com/. This is a must-read
    in my eyes. Nevertheless I think that my dirty illustration shows the biggest
    problems.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/star_4842.jpg]\r\n<em></em>\r\n<em></em>\r\nConcerning
    typography ... did you draw the letters? If not, forget about sizing and concentrate
    on kerning (space between one and another character). In my opinion the characters
    themselves are to thin to be so close to each other. I think with a bolder font
    the connection between 's' and 't' and as a result the overall tightness of the
    two words might work better. Maybe you could also connect 'e' and 's' then.\r\n<em></em>\r\nThe
    capital 'T' from Test looks like a small-cap 't' though it doesn't look like the
    other ones ... this kind of confusses me.\r\n<em></em>\r\nThe dash between Best
    and Test looks like an en-dash which would be a mistake in this context so I'd
    suggest to make it shorter and look more like a typical hyphen.\r\n<em></em>\r\nSome
    personal taste at the end. For some reason I dislike the font in general. Maybe
    bolder and better kerned (maybe on the same baseline) would improve it and make
    it work for me but I would try another one ... but as I mentioned this is my personal
    taste. I do really like the font you've used for '.net' but you'd maybe try to
    get it a little tighter (especially the dot)."

  body: "Thank you both.  This is is very helpful.\r\n\r\nriccard0: What do you mean
    by \"the type on Best-Test is too light compared with the surrounding strokes\"
    -- which strokes are you referring to?\r\n\r\nSimplicious: Thank you for the link
    for the star.  Will definitely check it out and rework it.  I did not draw the
    letters.  The font is called \"Unispace\" -- I was looking for a modern style
    font.  I did adjust the size/width of the \"B\" and \"t\" and the kerning just
    by my untrained eyeballs.  Yes, the \"t\" is an enlarged version of a lowercase
    one.  I wanted to emphasize the first letter without making it a capital letter.
    \ I guess it doesn't work well.  Also thanks for the hyphen comment.  I knew there
    is something wrong with it.\r\n\r\nThe \".net\" font is called \"Bauer,\" as in
    the skate manufacturer. I was trying to make it look modern overall, and wanted
    to space out the \".net\" to better balance with the above \"Best-test\" -- perhaps
    this doesn't work well.\r\n\r\nThanks again you both for the quick responses."

    I've no designer training. I tried to google a definition, but didn't see anything.)
    \ I actually decreased the width of the \"B\" (I think it was 70% of actual width).\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I read your article on Gestalt Principles.  Very interesting, but I don't understand
    what it means I should do with the widths of the two stars.  (I was just trying
    to make the shape more interesting/forward leaning.)  Would a consistent width
    be better?"

    don't match the italics. If you use italics for "best-test" make sure it has the

    opinion of your updated logos. \r\n\r\nI think that the third one works pretty
    well, but because of the fact that you have enlaged the b and t, they are now
    much thicker and so look a little bit too heavy to me. The hyphen should probably
    be a bit thicker and the lower right of the star seems a little too thick, the
    way that it flares out is leading my eye away from the logo.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion
    but I think it\u2019s definitely an improvement on the original!\r\n"
