  which is suited to my application but slightly too condensed and only available
  in one weight. I'm using it as a web font and the browser automatically boldens
  it when required, but it doesn't kern well when this happens. I'm using the font
  at 12px, 14px and 32px mostly.\r\n\r\nSome alternatives I've seen are:\r\nPatron:
  http://www.fontspring.com/search?q=patron\r\nUnicod: http://www.fontspring.com/search?q=unicod\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate your advice on the legibility and scalability of these fonts (and
  any similar you know of) and which one you consider the best."
