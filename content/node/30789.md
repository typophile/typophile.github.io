  body: "Dear Workday,\r\n\r\nI am (and so are most) horrible at trying to figure
    out pixel fonts. They just don't hold a candle to beautifully styled fonts.\r\n\r\nIn
    all my years of helping ID fonts - when it comes to pixel fonts I offer two suggestions.
    And hope your eyes are young enough to go through to find what you are looking
    for.\r\n\r\nCommercial Pixel Fonts\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=pixel\r\n\r\nShareware/Freeware/Charityware/Beerware\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php?page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Type+your+text+here&nb_ppp=50&af=on&classt=pop\r\n\r\nSorry
    I cannot be more helpful than that - but hopefully your font is among the many
    growing pixel fonts that are out there...\r\n"
