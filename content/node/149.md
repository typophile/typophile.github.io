  WSJ is supposed to unveil its redesign April 9. <BR> <BR>This paper is known as
  a &#39;financial&#39; newspaper, but less known is the fact that WSJ has the best
  daily feature writing in the country on a consistent basis. <BR> <BR>Now, maybe
  design to match. <BR> <BR>I was worried that WSJ was going to become another horrid
  McPaper, the USA Today. But then I read that the redesign is being done by Garcia
  Media. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>Here are a few links. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/business/1017788129.php"

    gain &#40;at least not entirely so&#41;, but please allow me this digression of
    sorts: <BR> <BR>&#62; the typeface in question would be in the stock listings
    <BR> <BR>Oh, good thing you told me - I almost scanned the wrong section. &#34;Scanned?!&#34;,
    you ask? Well, I&#39;ve been obsessed with measuring press gain in newspapers
    for a while now. This is partly because Nour &#40;Patria&#39;s Armenian counterpart&#41;
    is supposed to end up as the body face for a daily newspaper. Another reason is
    my fascination with trapping - something not usually needed but potentially very
    beneficial in a newspaper, &#42;especially&#42; for tiny type like in stock listing...
    <BR> <BR>So what I would love to be able to do with TFJ&#39;s new font is to superimpose
    a small snippet of hi-fi outline data over a hi-res scan of actual output. A big
    favor to ask, maybe, but something I will do once I have the scan for you guys.
    <BR> <BR>In the meantime, you can check out the following images: <BR> <BR>A scan
    from my &#34;target&#34; newspaper, next to a rendering, with measurements: <BR><A

    TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/latnewsp.gif</A> <BR>Point
    size: they don&#39;t say. <BR> <BR>Now, the Armenian sample clearly exhibits much
    more gain than any western newspaper would find itself stuck with, and even the
    second image is probably too drastic these days, but as long there&#39;s &#42;some&#42;
    gain, I&#39;d like to measure it. <BR> <BR>BTW, in case you&#39;d like to see

    in noting that the paper quality is a bit lower now than before, or is that just
    within expected variance? If it is lower, then that makes Retina even more impressive.
    Another coolness is the trapping. Look at the bold &#34;N&#34; in the zoom view
    - it&#39;s clearly superior to the old Helvetica results. And the characters with
    small bowls &#40;like the &#34;R&#34; - not shown there&#41; have that distinct

    effect, among the three lower limits &#40;reproduction fidelity, font features

  body: '&#62; www.typography.com/press/wsj_after_retina.gif <BR> <BR>First, thanks
    for that scan. It&#39;s much much better than mine &#40;no surprise&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve taken the liberty to do two things with it: <BR> <BR> <BR>1. Crop
    out this string: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_4.gif"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_4.gif</A> <BR> <BR>If
    TFJ is indeed &#34;listening&#34;, I&#39;d like to revise/downgrade my request
    for outlines to just those three letters &#40;at that weight, of course&#41;.
    If it doesn&#39;t happen, no biggie - if it happens, super nice of him. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    it&#39;s interesting to note that some of the trapping is still visible - a sure
    indication that Retina has more room &#34;below&#34;. <BR> <BR> <BR>2. Splice
    together a comparison of pre and post numerals: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_5.gif"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_5.gif</A> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    note again that the quality of the paper/reproduction seems lower in the Retina
    sample: look at the decimal points &#40;which I&#39;m presuming are rigid rectangles
    in the outlines&#41;. <BR> <BR>But the point of this comparison is the &#42;structures&#42;
    of the numerals, and Retina&#39;s are so superior to Helvetica&#39;s &#40;while
    remaining stylistically homogenous&#41;, it&#39;s not even funny. <BR> <BR>----
    <BR> <BR>Thinking some more about what I previously wrote concerning the three
    &#34;lower limits&#34; of legibility &#40;with respect to size&#41;, I realized
    that the untapped potential of Retina &#40;I mean untapped by WSJ&#41; isn&#39;t
    really in terms of size &#40;especially considering that the average WSJ reader
    is more likely to have faltering vision, being more &#34;senior&#34;&#41;, but
    more in terms of fidelity &#40;or actually, lack of it&#41;: TFJ has made a font
    which can work well in much poorer reproduction conditions than we&#39;re seeing
    here. Now, a trapping axis would be &#42;so&#42; nice, but at least its &#91;apparent&#93;
    absence gives us something to look forward to! <BR> <BR>&#62; Tobias likened these
    strangenesses to particle theory <BR> <BR>Not to be too literal, but let&#39;s
    not forget that we&#39;re physical beings in a physical world! <BR> <BR>I in turn
    might draw a parallel between the states of matter &#40;solid, liquid, gaseous,
    plasma&#41; and the states of reading &#40;here with respect to size&#41;. I once
    sketched this rough graph: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic_01.gif"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic_01.gif</A> <BR> <BR>It
    tries to show a correspondence between size and optical compensation &#40;here
    I mean things like more open counters&#41;. Above a certain point size &#40;nominally
    24 here&#41; there is no need for compensation at all. Below a certain point size
    &#40;like 5&#41;, the extenders &#91;have to&#93; become so short that you&#39;d
    break down and use all-caps - at that size immersive reading is virtually impossible
    anyway. And the segment of least slope &#40;here between 8 and 12&#41; is the
    most delicate part, where boumas &#40;word shapes&#41; have to be just right.
    I could elaborate more, but you might be bored senseless already, and it&#39;s
    getting late over here... <BR> <BR>So let me try to wrap this up: <BR>The reason
    for the non-linearity of the graph is due to the &#34;fighting-sisters&#34; nature
    of Legibility versus Readability: they come into play differently depending on
    type size &#40;among other things, of course&#41;, and together they give up three
    states of reading: <BR>1. Below comfortable immersive reading: here legibility
    is king &#40;queen?&#41;, and x-heights have to swell, for example. <BR>2. Immersive
    reading: readability is more important than legibility - and for example ITC-style
    x-heights ruin everything. <BR>3. Above comfortable reading: legibility is a non-issue
    &#40;although what might be called &#34;decipherability&#34; is key&#41;, and
    readability is moot. What counts most here? What I call &#34;drama&#34; &#40;avoiding
    the potentially misleading &#34;beauty&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    correct weight - the Agate Five&#41;, but hopefully it gives you some idea. <BR>
    <BR>Thinking about this some more, I feel more comfortable in restating that Retina
    goes further than it needs to in this specific commission/application &#40;the
    WSJ stock listings&#41;, but that &#42;does&#42; mean it can survive even worse
    repro conditions and/or smaller sizes. <BR> <BR>hhp'
