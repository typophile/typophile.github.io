  <BR>This typeface, as Paula Scher describes in her book, <i>Make It Bigger</i>,
  is a jazzy, 20&#39;s-inspired typeface. If anyone could identify this font for me,
  I would truly appreciate it. Thank you! <BR> <BR>Bananne

  body: You could achieve a look quite a bit like this with our own Mark Simonson&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/" target="_blank">&#39;Mostra&#39;</a>.
    It comes in 5 weights &#40;the heavy is most like this&#41; and many characters
    have 2 or 3 variations. It is all uppercase, but creating a lower case &#39;i&#39;
    and a few smaller-size latters would be easy enough using a heavier weight &#40;Mostra
    Black&#41; at a smaller size. It is also based on type styles of the 20&#39;s
    and 30&#39;s.

    Banhof</a> isn&#39;t a match, but it has a similar feel.

  body: I wouldn&#39;t be surprised is Ms. Scher had a typeface created. Granted they
    probably started with something else, but she loves wood type and probably wanted
    it to have a more organic/tactile presentation than simply cold type.
