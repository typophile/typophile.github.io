  1 from Nick Curtis\r\n- 1 from Levente Halmos\r\n- 3 by myself! ;)\r\n- 1 from \"Apostrophe\"
  - and it's free!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-10-02_3686.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nNow
  there are over 100 fonts available on CheapProFonts, and many more are on the way!
  I have just started cooperation with another designer (Gyom S\xE9guin/Last Soundtrack
  of Bleeding Cowboys fame ;) so soon there will be some more grungy and gritty fonts
  available, too.\r\n\r\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType
  and TrueType fonts for setting \"foreign\" languages (languages requiring more than
  the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\r\nCheck our site
  for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\r\n\r\nRoger S. Nelsson\r\n--\r\nhttp://www.CheapProFonts.com\r\nHigh
  quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers
  with a small budget!"

  body: "Well, all of the fonts (except my own designs) are free fonts to begin with
    - the original, basic versions are available from all the usual freefont sites.
    So I cannot really charge too much for my reworked, multilingual Pro versions.
    ;)\r\n\r\nBut the main reason is that the whole idea of CheapProFonts is to reach
    users in regions where the economics is not strong enough to purchase other commercially
    available fonts that contain all the needed characters - like Eastern Europe and
    South America.\r\n\r\nSo I have set the price level as low as I can - without
    actually losing money on the project. It is a hobby, that also happens to create
    a little pocketmoney for myself and the designers I work with.\r\n\r\nMore on
