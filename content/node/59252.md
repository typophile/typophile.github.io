body: "hello,\r\n\r\ni'm verry new to font making and am stuck on the feature i want
  to make. there are all glyphs made and in some typing occasions i want them to be
  different: when i type \"gj\", or \"jj\" or \"yj\" i want them to join in a specific
  way (j is shorter). should i make a separate glyph of those pairs or should i make
  different glyphs of the same letters and put some script that says how they should
  join when follow each other?"

    for them. To make this work in a font, you need to \"program\" this. I have put
    this between quotes because it is not that hard to do, it is required to make
    your font in a software package like fontlab, if you need help a lot of people
    can help (you could already check the manual on their website). But why a jj ligature?
    Are there words that use jj combinations? In what language?\r\n\r\nGood luck"

  body: "Sidney, thanks for the answer. i use Fontlab and understand that it goes
    to \"programming\", but i don't know how. if you know those manuals, please show
    the links. \r\nmaybe there are no words with jjjj, but if someone would want to
    write so, i want text to look the right way. anyway, most important is yj combination.
    there are some lithuanian words like: lyja, ryja, gyja..."

  body: "I'm not such an expert on this, but I think you do this:\r\n\r\nYou make
    a new character by going to Glyph -> Generate Glyphs. In the top field in the
    window that appears you can name the new glyph, use something like y_j. Open the
    glyph, and design your yj ligature.\r\n\r\nThen go to Window -> Panels -> OpenType.
    Click the little + sign on the lower left of the OpenType panel. This creates
    a new (but empty) opentype feature.\r\n\r\nSelect the new feature in the left
    field of the window, and replace the default:\r\n\r\n<code>feature xxxx {\r\n
    \ sub by ;\r\n} xxxx;</code>\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n<code>feature liga {\r\nsub y
    j by y_j;\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nIf you have more ligatures, just place them
    underneath the last one, above the bottom \"} liga;\"."

    a windmill over yonder?\r\n\r\nWhether you use ligatures or contextual alternates
    depends. First of all, only a little current software supports OpenType features.
    Of those that do, most support ligatures, fewer support contextual alternates.\r\n\r\nLigatures
    may revert to the base characters when a certain tracking value is reached. You
    may or may not want them to. If not, contextual alternates would be best. If you
    want the end user to think about whether or not to use them, they are discretionary
    ligatures (*dlig*). If you want him/her to take effort to not use them, put them
    in *liga*.\r\n\r\nCurrently, contextual alternates -- or ligatures -- are a group
    that is either on or off. That is, you get all or none. If you want several stylistic
    variations which are independent of each other, put them in stylistic sets --
    which even less software supports.\r\n\r\nFinally, almost all letter pairs in
    the Latin alphabet occur. I learned that with King Arthur's mom, suddenly needing
    to kern Yg (Ygraine)."

  body: With the Latin alphabet, it may be more fruitful to wonder which potential
    troublesome letter pairs we <em>don't</em> have to worry about. As Charles says,
    almost all letter pairs occur. But yes, this is a topic for another thread.

  body: 'thank you all. really, in this case the calt feature is better, because only
    one glyph should change when it goes after another. when using liga feature i
    write jjjjjjjj (of course there''s no such word, but in such crazy moments i want
    it to look correct). only first pair goes to right combination and then the third
    j goes without ligature. with calt feature i made that every j goes in good way
    no matter how many of them will go. '
