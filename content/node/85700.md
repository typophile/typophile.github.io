    fact that his campaign invested heavily in graphic design--which wasn't a major
    priority of most campaigns up to that point. \r\n\r\nWhat would impress me is
    a campaign focused on facts and figures over rhetoric and talking points, but
    that's not really a visual branding issues a much as a character branding issue. "

  body: Maybe I am not really understanding the hypothetical situation you are suggestion,
    but I would caution you to avoid thinking that branding is some sort of treatment
    that gets applied to an organization like a font is applied to a string of text.  Branding
    isn't the glossy surface that makes the organization look nice, but rather a culmination
    of everything the organization is and communicates.  The font that I would recommend
    would depend entirely on the brand, and the brand would depend on the identity
    of the political figure in relation to their audience.  That's my approach at
    least.

    but focus instead on substantive issues. What you are seeking is a \"savvy\" brand,
    one which exploits as much of the non-reflective kind of thought that goes into
    making purchasing decisions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we appear to live in a time
    when \"smart\" and \"political\" are mutually exclusive terms. In' just sayin'\u2026"

- body: "aluminium; \r\nYour response made me think about how underused infographics
    are used in political campaigns. Given how plugged-in and visual American society
    is, it seems like infographics would be an invaluable tool of political communication.
    Yet, I can't recall ever seeing a campaign use anything but lame bar charts. \r\n\r\noldnick;\r\nYes,
    I agree - a \"savvy brand\" for a politician is what I'm interested in exploring.
    Frankly, I'm somewhat surprised by the negative reaction to the word \"brand\"
    in this thread. I took for granted people knew I was talking about an authentic
    visual representation of political messaging, but it seems most thought I was
    alluding to a shallow makeover used to manipulate voters. That's not what I meant. "

  body: "\"Unfortunately, we appear to live in a time when \"smart\" and \"political\"
    are mutually exclusive terms. \"\r\n\r\nWell, I'd say most campaigns are very
    'smart' in terms of research, strategy, pr and marketing. They might be doing
    it for all the wrong reasons, but there is a lot of thinking going on there. \r\n\r\nAs
    for infographics, that'd hurt most politicians. Information graphics are useful
    at communicating data. Data is the enemy of the politician's brand as data can
    be used to counter their beliefs. Most presidential candidates are selling belief
    systems rather than specific solutions. Why that is is an interesting question
    and one I don't readily have an answer to other than it's typically easier to
    brand and sell a 'feeling' more than an actual product feature. "

  body: "As for the term 'brand' I think most people in marketing/design industries
    have very mixed feeling about it. The term has been abused greatly to refer to
    visual marketing when many feel that the real definition of a corporate brand
    falls more into the public perception camp.\r\n\r\nI am of the latter and feel
    that brands aren't created but rather earned. We can make a visual asset to help
    represent that brand, but if that brand hasn't been earned, then it's merely lipstick
    on a pig. Sometimes that works. Sometimes it doesn't. \r\n\r\nI think a lot of
    businesses use the term 'rebranding' now as a couched way of saying \"we treat
    our customers like crap...let's make a new logo to see if we can fool them a bit
    longer.\""

    IMHO, infographics could be used effectively to sell the data of belief systems

  body: "On the subject of typefaces and typography for political campaigns:\r\n\r\nHoefler
    and Frere-Jones added serifs to Gotham, making a slab-serif version, at the request
    of the Obama campaign:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=261\r\n\r\nOn
    the subject of branding as a form of manipulation:\r\n\r\nI love typography and
    design but I hate advertising and commercialism. This probably explains why I
    mainly design books \u2014 and ideally only the interiors at that. In this capacity,
    design is not really about selling anything, but only providing for a suitable,
    unobtrusive, and subtly allusive reading experience. At the risk of sounding corny,
    it is not about making money; it's about making something beautiful. Design can
    be used, as it often is, to manipulate people in order to make money or spread
    ideas. I feel that though this is design's most obvious use, it is often a misuse.
    However, I will gladly design pieces that do exactly this for causes I believe
    in.\r\n\r\n\"Branding,\" by the way, literally refers to heated metal stamps (brands)
    that were used to mark cattle and even slaves as belonging to their masters. Brands
    are deliberately created to cement the identity of their owners into the minds
    of consumers or the general public. So, to get back to Alaskan's original question,
    what might interest me is a politician without a brand \u2014 one whose identity
    is strong enough that not every poster has to match in order for people to understand
    who it is evoking. Of course, this might never work. It does contribute to having
    a unified group of supporters if the campaign has a strong visual identity. But
    was Obama's first campaign, which was widely described as effective \"grass roots\"
    marketing, really so grass-roots if the identity was determined on a national
    level by a single group of designers?\r\n\r\nDo campaigns, in other words, need
    branding? Did George Washington have a \"brand\"? Is there a better way of designing
    in support of politicians than by stamping a logo on everything?"

    materials first started appearing, but they certainly existed in the 1800s. I
    doubt if there was much branding from the standpoint of typography, though. \r\n\r\nBut
    perhaps the content of those materials was even more influential in those days
    than campaign materials are today, since in those days there was no television,
    radio or internet, and many people voted without ever seeing or hearing the candidates;
    they relied mostly on newspaper articles and campaign materials. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lincoln2_5019.jpg]"
