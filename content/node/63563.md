  body: "The amount of closure of the C is a good clue to finding this. I don't think
    either of your candidates would be very close. It's possible it was graphically
    widened/flattened, but if not either Engravers Gothic or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-sans/|Aviano
    Sans]] might be close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
