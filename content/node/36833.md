  these days, and want to know what the good poeple on here thinks about the mix of
  typefaces.\r\nI was thinking of using  a slightly costumized Avenir for headings,
  Akzidenz Grotesk as subheading and for quotes and Sabon for the bodytext. ...but
  I'm a bit worried for it being too much.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you guys think? Would
  it be possible to mix the three of them or should I stick with just two - an if
  so, should that be avenir & sabon or akzidenz grotesk & sabon?\r\n\r\nlet me hear
  your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you"

    or two different types altogether.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of publication is it? Your
    type choices are very corporate.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Avenir and Akzidenz Grotesk are certainly not the same typeface. But I think
    that, to casual readers, they may seem close enough alike that they'll almost
    just sense the difference, rather than seeing them outright. This, in turn, will
    be almost like an unconscious message that something's not right. It'll be an
    irritation: that the two \"almost match\"--again, to the untrained eye of readers
    who are not into typography.\r\n\r\nWhy on earth would you give readers that kind
    of \"itch\" that they can't scratch? I mean, what's the aim? Wouldn't using, maybe,
    a different version of of <i>one</i> of those types for each of the display heads
    make more sense and provide a unity of purpose?\r\n\r\nThat said, I think Sabon
    is a great face for body text.\r\n\r\nI just don't think you want to put together
    too fonts that are close but no cigar, as it will distract the reader\u2014even
    if only unconsciously\u2014and maybe hinder comprehension. But maybe I'm taking
    myself oo seriously, reading and re-reading <a href=\"http://publishingcareers.blogspot.com/2007/09/stephen-tiano-freelance-book-designer.html\">
    <strong>an interview of me</strong></a> on the blog, <strong>Publishing Careers.</strong>
    I make a point there of saying\u2014I'm paraphrasing now\u2014that making pages
    is supposed to serve the reader."

  body: "thanks for your thoughts.\r\nI've decided to scrap avenir all trhough and
    go for akzidenz grotesk and sabon. any objections to that?\r\n\r\nSuperUltraFabolous:
    It's for a left-wing political idealistic organisation, with readers from 15 to
    50, so huge age gap, and the conent is everything from ligh-hearted funny stuff
    to serious heavy politics.\r\n"

  body: I think you're right to stick with AG. Avenir is a bit bland, AG makes more
    of a statement and will also connect (subconsciously of  course) with the pre-digital
    world. It also has more weights and variety.

    Chronicle? It makes a beautiful combination and a new Scotch looks slightly more
    interesting than Sabon.\r\nBoth fonts can be found on www.typography.com"
