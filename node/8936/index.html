  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is my first attempt at properly developing a typeface so I warn you now it will probably look a bit crude. It&#39;s still in FreeHand at the moment while I read up on Fontographer.  <BR> <BR>I started off trying to make a more readable alternative to display typefaces like Sharp. I then amended the idea to include designing for dyslexics &#40;avoiding the double-storey &#39;a&#39;, making the &#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39; and &#39;o&#39; very different and making &#39;b&#39;/&#39;d&#39; and &#39;p&#39;/&#39;q&#39; characters that don&#39;t mirror each other&#41;. This was sparked by articles in Creative Review on alternatives to Comic Sans that are readable for dyslexics &#40;like Lexia - <a href="http://www.k-type.com" target="_blank">www.k-type.com</a>&#41; and the Read Regular font by Natascha Frensch &#40;<a href="http://www.readregular.com" target="_blank">www.readregular.com</a>&#41;. <BR> <BR>I realise the ascenders of my typeface may not be tall enough for dyslexics but wanted to get some feedback anyway. I especially wanted to know if there&#39;s anything similar to this already out there?  <BR> <BR><!--attachment: talon_draft3-64127.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*9.6*Talon+specimen*talon_draft3%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Talon specimen<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/talon_draft3-64127.pdf" target="_blank"><b>talon_draft3.pdf</b></a> (9.6 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that design for dyslexia is quite interesting, and that this design can become interesting, but the two don&#39;t mix, basically because this is very firmly in the display realm, and dyslexia is about reading. <BR> <BR>You can use science &#40;or at least analysis&#41; to make <i>any</i> font more legible or readable, but I think if you want to focus on such a singular &#34;disorder&#34; a texty design would have to to be the target. <BR> <BR>&#40;That took about 2 minutes - not too bad a redistribution of <BR>time/efficiency if it might end up saving Derek a few hours, eh?&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Hrant; this is like an expanded ultra-black, and would not work at all in a text setting. It wouldn&#39;t even be that legible in a display setting, although I suppose it would be more legible than usual for dyslexics. This might be interesting if you treat it as a blackweight alternative to a much lighter regular textface, but if readability is your goal, you&#39;re probably going to need to play with serifs of some kind as well. <BR> <BR>On another note, has Natascha ever released Read Regular? It&#39;s a neat idea, and someday I&#39;d like to actually play with it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I take both your points. I think because I started this as a display face then thought about dyslexic issues later it will always be a secondary thing, not the main reason behind the design. I was going to take the dyslexia part out of the title of this post &#40;and attach a proper PDF!&#41; but didn&#39;t know how. <BR> <BR>I have started a sans serif face much more aimed at helping dyslexics so I think I will put those efforts into that design instead. Is it worth doing more work on this typeface or are there already faces like this available? <BR> <BR>&#40;PS: Read Regular still doesn&#39;t seem to be commercially available, unfortunately.&#41;</div>
