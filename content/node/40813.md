  body: "Hello Megumi,\r\nIt is difficult to ID with only a single letter, because
    there is no way to be sure it isn't hand-drawn. If it was a very familiar font,
    maybe we would recognize it, but it's hard with only this to see. I will try looking
    in my Script Font ID Guide Part 7 or 8 to see if i can spot this M.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I did not find any good matches, and I realized that this may also be a lower
    case 'm'. One of the most similar upper case M's was in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/brophy-script/|Brophy]],
    but you can see the details are not a real match.\r\n\r\nWithout any more letters,
    I think we might have to guess this is custom lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Mike it also looks a lot like something which someone could create quite easily  using
    one of the brushes in Illustrator.
