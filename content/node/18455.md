body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to build some basic OT code just for the 'fi' 'fl'
  combo's to start with. I'm following the user manual. The attached pic is giving
  me errors, I tried diff combinations with ' l i by li'  'li by l i ' 'l_i by li'
  etc. But when I compile it errors out saying\r\n\r\n'<verticeITALIC-ItalicItalic>
  aborting because of errors...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTerrors.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Hello. Glyphs are identified by their glyphname in feature code. If your
    ligature is called f_l (bottom of your image), this is the name to be put after
    the \"by\", so: \"sub f l by f_l;\"\r\n\r\nBut I am surprised about aborting because
    of errors. Normally FL would just say: glyphs don't exist, shall I create them
    ... Do you have other features already defined in the leftside column but without
    content yet?\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "Eric, you should probably use the \"standard\" names of \"fi\" and \"fl\"
    for those two glyphs: they have Unicode indices and places in the Mac Roman codepage.
    \r\n\r\nI wonder why the compile isn't working for you. That's the simplest feature
    in the universe!\r\n\r\nIf you're still having problems, you can email the file
    to me and I'll troubleshoot it for you. (I'd hate for your avatar to come true.)"

  body: "Update: I renamed the Unicode-supported ligatures, as well as some of the
    \"spare parts\" glyphs in the VFB. I cleared the Unicode, and then generated Unicode
    with PUA for the non-Unicode glyphs. I rewrote the liga feature to reflect these
    changes, and the feature compiled successfully.\r\n\r\nCase closed!"
