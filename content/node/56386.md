  work of John Langdon, but does any one have any other tips in designing these or
  great ambigram artists to check out?"

  body: "Hi Matt,\r\n\r\nI have been working directly with John Langdon for the past
    five years. The one major piece of advice I see when I look at other peoples'
    ambigrams is that it looks like all the work was done on the computer. Throughout
    my time working with and being taught by John, he has always emphasized the creative
    process. Always starting with a pencil and paper before any digital tool is touched
    can create more possibilities to explore/refine later. Think about how fast you
    can sketch out a few letters on paper as opposed to just jumping into Illustrator/Freehand
    etc and trying to 'sketch' digitally. Not all words will work and forcing a word
    to work usually results in a less than ideal final product. Another tip is not
    starting with a defined style in mind, you must respect each letterform and what
    structure is required to make that character recognizable to the reader. I just
    posted my latest piece over here: http://www.typophile.com/node/56418\r\n\r\nIf
    you go to John's website and click on Contact then Choose Commission - Ambigram
    - For Personal Use, you'll see some more of the custom type work I've done."

  body: "I couldn't agree with Dave more. I had a class with the owner of Managerie
    Creative, a design firm specializing in the film industry, and had a workshop
    on ambigrams. Everything was done by hand and tightly refined multiple times before
    even jumping on the computer. The ambigrams looked better in the end and as hard
    as it may be to believe, it was 100 times easier starting on paper than on the
    computer. I just posted some here: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/57151\">http://typophile.com/node/57151</a>\r\nI'm
    not sure if they are all from Managerie but Princess Bride and Managerie (obviously)
    are. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://johanvilchez.com\">Johan Vilchez</a>"
