  I'd love to get your opinions on!  Kerning is absent. Spacing is very much there,
  but not good yet."

    to National Reg? \r\n\r\nYou could just use National and save your self the time
    of drawing it? \r\n\r\nSeems logical to me. Obviously National is drawn better
    though.\r\n\r\nH"

  body: Dude, that's not really a nice thing to say. I own National, and I am the
    first to admit I looked to it to find relations between character widths. It's
    really a lovely face, but I hope I've managed to add my own flair to it.

    http://www.typophile.com/node/55857\r\nI've been looking at other grotesques for
    reference as well. I see your point on my font being close to National when compared.
    \"I hope I've managed to add my own flair to it\" should not imply basing it on
    National, though I understand you can read that into it. I'm not a native tounge:)"

    a <em>license</em> to use it.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good thing to take
    your design and steer away from National very intentionally from now on. I see
    where you tried to add your own flair to it, but you can probably add much more
    of that."

    the design. Intentionally steering away:)
