  a specific distressed/display style, so it's still understandable to people reading
  it? I need to make an Ethiopian version of a custom designed latin logotype and
  would like the Amharic letterforms to retain the look.\r\n\r\nOriginal latin logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tezeta-Latin_3690.png]\r\n\r\nA

  found some information on the Amharic alphabet in [[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fCQjQkaZBEwC&lpg=PP1&ots=jOHXkYIRMq&dq=subject%3A%22amharic%20language%22&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false|this
  book]]. It says that there are 33 basic characters and there are combinations with
  additional strokes or symbols to create new characters for different sounds. \r\n\r\nMy
  questions:\r\nHow specific those strokes and symbols need to be? \r\nIs there any
  guide somewhere?\r\nHow far can you go with simplification of such a script (Amharic,
  Arabic etc) in general? \r\nIs the above example acceptable/readable or should the
  characteristics/serifs be put back?"

  body: "In your original logo the little rings are purely decorative, but in the
    Amharic I think they may be confusing to readers, since Amharic readers are used
    to treating most end-of-stroke details as meaningful. So my suggestion is to utilise
    this feature of the script and in the Amharic version use the rings systematically
    as 'flag' replacements. I believe you can simplify the mid-stroke arms as you
    have done, but that you should maintain the top and bottom flag patterns, using
    the rings. I would revise the first syllable form to maintain the connection between
    the left and right sides. I think you could safely double the crossbar of the
    middle syllable to echo your treatment of the original logo. So, I suggest something
    like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JH-Tezeta-Amharic_3682_4163.png]"

  body: "Hi Harnt , Hope all is well. As John has pointed rightly, In Amharic  end
    of strokes are meaningful .\r\nWhenever you think of Amharic script you have to
    think of writing sequences(or stroke). It is because\r\nWe have  34 basic characters
    and they are modified in to six variations. In your case the word comes from two
    basic characters which looks like t and H the red and the blue are diacritical
    marks which change the basic sounds . I have also circled the 3 characters you
    used in your logo. That is why it is important following the structure of each
    letter not to confuse them. \r\nWhen you write each character you have to follow
    a rule. The rule is to finish from left to the right . Traditionally going back
    is not allowed (Please see the image below ). For example the letter a has to
    be written only in this order.(Finishing from left )  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tt_Har_1_4914.png]\r\nWhen
    you want to modify a script like you are trying to do, You have to think of the
    skeleton of each characters. John\u2019s suggestions maintaining the flag patterns
    is important, however in this case putting the rings above, below or at the center
    of the Joints(Like I did)  it will increase legibility. This is Where thinking
    of the skeleton of the characters comes handy, for example on the 3rd character
    . The bottom is not horizontal it is diagonal.\r\nTo answer your questions: \r\nHow
    specific those strokes and symbols need to be? As long as you maintain the skeleton
    of each glyph it does not have to be specific. What you started is good and looks
    different from what we have seen.\r\nDoubling the cross bar or making it wider
    or narrower will make it only beautiful.   \r\nIs there any guide somewhere? So
    far I don\u2019t know any guide. I am working on a book. God knows when I am going
    to finish it. Whatever questions you have you can e-mail me. \r\nTo demonstrate
    what I am talking about here is a quick example  ..\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tt_Har_2_5793.png]\r\n@
    John I have not talked to you for so long how are ? Will e-mail \r\nAleme"

  body: "OK, did some tweaking. Not sure about the ring in the last character, but
    as John rightly pointed out, it's purely decorative. I'd imagine, Ethiopians would
    see it the same way (as long as the skeleton is right)? It also nicely counter-balances
    the diacritical mark on the first letter. Three rings, as suggested above, seemed
    too much in a short word. Again, I'd appreciate pointing out any mistakes. Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tezeta-amharic-2_4195.png]"

  body: "Hi! I would say it is beautiful !! As a graphic object it is beautiful .
    Having different width make it more lively and matches the Latin characters. For
    a native reader it is Legible and look nice . Judging by the meaning of the word
    I am just guessing this might be for music album  or book cover . I think it works
    well . John has very good feeling and knowledge of Ethiopic. Yes it is purely
    decorative but the way it is done now is good. To make it real perfect (For my
    eyes) the horizontal bars on the last two characters has to be a little bit up
    (As you see below )  \r\n   [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tizita_3755.jpg]"
