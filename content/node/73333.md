body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nsome month ago, while I was adjusting the spacing of my current
  font, I found a picture or article somewhere in the internet, where the letters
  were put in categories about which horizontal spacing they need in relation to the
  left and right bearing of \u203Am o\u2039 respectivly \u203AH O\u2039. For example
  c e d and o were in the same group marked with a certain color on the left to show,
  that they need the same space there and there was a chart how much more space it
  aproximately needs in comparison to a lower m. I forgot to save this webpage or
  picture or whatever and even didn't create a bookmark.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where
  I can find that or something similar?\r\n\r\ncheers \r\n\r\nbenny"

    an article. I think there were two pages about spacing of lowercase letters and
    one about uppercase letters. Certainly it's not from Karen Chang's Book.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nbenny"

    program. I also looked into \xBBLearn Fontlab Fast\xAB but's not in there either."
