  surprised me because the typeface Renner, a historically interesting revival from
  the de Vinne Press, is among those recommended - and it also shows wide spacing
  between letters as helpful."

  body: "I don\u2019t think general principles are of much use in typography that
    targets speci\uFB01c demographic groups with speci\uFB01c information.\r\n\r\nIn
    marketing, which has been doing this for at least a century (i.e. since Starch),
    focus groups and split runs have been found to be most effective. \r\n\r\nNow
    we have agile design, which is a more sophisticated version of such methods.\r\n\r\nSo
    I would say, by all means be open-minded and try unusual spacing, if designing
    typography for a dyslexic audience of one kind or another, but test it against
    other options.\r\n"
