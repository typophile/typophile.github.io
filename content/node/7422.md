  body: Easier and faster for late-antique scribes to write. Later, Charlemagne thought
    that it was a good idea. The rest is history &#40;oh yeah, Cosimo di Medici and
    the humanists had a hand in codifing it, too&#41;. <BR> <BR>Not all writing sytstems
    have multiple cases, though.

  body: I believe there is some well documented evidence that script-like &#40;miniscule&#41;
    faces were used in the tier structure of the Phoencians, Egyptians, Greeks, and
    Romans, etc where they served as sort of the low end status form of written communication

    <BR>These are from your part of the world, it might not be an answer your question
    directly but I think they are worth looking at. It reinforces the point Dan made.
    Apparently the Romans, when pulling out of the fort, burnt correspondence and
    the fire failed to burn everything &#40;the material is wood&#41; and these were
    found under ashes. <BR>Tim
