    few times I've used them I just type f.ex. \u201Co\u201D followed by \u201C^\u201D
    and use kerning to obtain the right position. There's no need for any sidebearings,
    but negative left sidebearing seems like good idea."

  body: "An introduction to the subject could be my earlier posts re: using diacretics
    in InDesign: http://www.typophile.com/node/61330\r\n\r\nI never tried, but since
    the OT feature appears to work just fine in Notepad and Wordpad (the canonical
    Windows editors), I presume the features <em>would</em> work in other fully OT
    aware applications.\r\n\r\nFrode's using negative sidebearings is the most simple
    way of minimal support; of course, this does not work for any character, as the
    negative bearing is a fixed distance. If your target app has basic OTF support,
    you can substitute accents on regular characters for an accented composite glyph
    for at least a basic set."

    in this table\r\n\r\nhttp://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf\r\n\r\nDo I use Opentype
    programming to construct the glyphs in this table from a base glyph and the Combining

    programming\r\n\r\nIf I created all the glyphs in 1E00 table is there still a

  body: "It depends on what your client wants to use the font for :-)\r\n\r\nThere
    are a few lists that describe which accents are used where (it was mentioned recently
    somewhere in this forum).\r\nFor basic purposes, the basic latin set is enough,
    covering (from the top of my memory) English (using no diacritics except in a
    few loanwords), French, German (some dialects have orthographies of their own),
    Dutch, Italian, Spanish and all (or almost all) Scandinavian languages -- all
    from Western Europe.\r\nAdd a few carons, the l-stroke, e-underdot, and a few
    more, and you can add Eastern Europe languages (Polish, Czech) as well. Note that
    at this point on the map, Cyrillic comes into play.\r\n\r\nThen there are languages
    such as latinized Azeri (sp.?), which adds lower and upper case schwa, and latin
    based orthographies of African languages, with lower and upper case eng (as well
    as even more accents).\r\nVietnamese uses the Latin alphabet, but adds a unique
    accent: the horned 'u' and 'o', and lots and lots of stacked accents as well.
    That's where it is getting complicated: you can either create each of those characters,
    or you can rely on OTF aware applications to have the accents placed automatically.\r\n\r\nThe
    practical problem is where to draw the line -- how many composite glyphs can you
    draw before cracking up? So the obvious advantage of including Combining Diacritical
    Marks is that your client at least has a shot of placing accents himself.\r\n\r\nMy
    use of accents goes beyond the UC consortium wildest dreams: phonological (IPA)
    notation of any random vocal utterance requires any of the 100-odd basic diacritical
    marks above, below, and sometimes through any latin character, in any number of
    permutations, <em>plus</em> it needs a fair share of additional forms ([[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0250.pdf)|the
    IPA basic set]]) -- I wouldn't get very far with composite glyphs."

    programming.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou can do both. If your font has an 'a', a combining
    acute (\xB4), <em>and</em> an a-acute, the user can insert an '\xE1' right away
    if his keyboard allows it, or by using something like Insert Symbol (Word) or
    Glyph Panel (InDesign). If the user enters 'a' then 'acute', you can have opentype
    magic automatically replace it with the actual '\xE1' glyph. For accents on lowercase
    'i', you can either have just the 'i' replaced with a dotless one, or immediately
    with the correct glyph-plus-accent.\r\n\r\nIt has the advantage you can tell the
    user to always type the base character, then the accent. If the font contains
    a composite glyph, you can have opentype replace it; otherwise, leave it as it
    is."

  body: Combining diacritic marks can be used to encode and, with appropriate font
    support, display arbitrary letter+diacritic mark combinations, including stacked
    diacritic marks on a single letter. There are very many languages in the world
    whose alphabets include diacritic letters that are not separately encoded in Unicode;
    for these, combining diacritic marks are essential for both encoding and display
    of text. How the resulting diacritics are displayed, when encoded in text as base
    letter + diacritic mark, depends on the font and the layout engine. In an OpenType
    font, you have a choice of either making precomposed glyphs for anticipated diacritic
    letter combinations (mapping these in GSUB lookups in the 'ccmp' feature) or using
    dynamic mark positioning (using GPOS mark-to-base and mark-to-mark anchor attachment
    lookups in the 'mark' and 'mkmk' features). The approach you take should be guided
    by your client's needs. If your client has a specific list of language support
    requirements with known diacritic combinations, and this set of not too large,
    then you might find the GSUB/ccmp approach easiest. You will be able to do this
    directly in FontLab. If the requirements are very extensive or open ended, i.e.
    they need to handle arbitrary combinations, then you'll need to use the GPOS solution.
    For this you will need to use either the MS VOLT tool or the new Adobe FDK or
    some other non-FontLab option.

  body: "You might like to read this FAQ from the Unicode Consortium: http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html
    .\r\n\r\nLinguists, depending on their specialization, often need combining diacritics
    to properly typeset their work.  Theunis de Jong mentioned the International Phonetic
    Alphabet, and John Hudson mentioned world languages (particularly non-European
    languages which use the Roman alphabet: think Africa and the Americas).  I personally
    use combining diacritics on an almost-daily basis, for IPA and to typeset Alaska
    Native languages.  One of the most frequent letters in Aleut is an x with a circumflex--there
    is no single Unicode character corresponding to this letter, as the above FAQ
    goes to great lengths to emphasize.  I\xF1upiaq has the letter l with stroke and
    dot below; it's a less-frequent letter, but just as you can't leave out the letter
    j in English, you can't leave out \u0142\u0323 in I\xF1upiaq; and you can't represent
    it in Unicode without a combining diacritic mark.\r\n\r\nSome resources:\r\n\r\nCharis
    SIL is not the world's most beautiful font, but it has excellent support for combining
    diacritics, including GPOS anchors: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=CharisSILFont\r\n\r\nFontForge
    (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/) has excellent support for adding GPOS anchors
    to a font.  If you'd like to use FontForge for this task (regardless of what program
    you used for the rest of the font development), I'd be happy to walk you through
    the process."
