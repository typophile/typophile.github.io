  and convert newer Unicode/MacRoman only fonts to MacTurkish.  I've been working
  with the cmap tables. Things work fine in TextEdit and Freehand, but Adobe applications
  seem to ignore the Turkish characters in the Unicode tables, even though ftxdumperfuser
  says they match the MacTurkish tables.\r\n\r\nI figured something was up with the
  post table, so I fixed that as well. Nothing's happening. What else do I need to
  change?\r\n\r\nI can email some sample input/output files in a few hours if you
  like."

  body: "Generally, Adobe apps don't care about glyph names and the post table for
    Unicode encoding - that's a Mac OS X bug, that we hope Apple will fix some day.
    For Adobe's apps that share the core Adobe font engine, the cmap encoding is all
    that matters for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    body: "I'm pretty sure my program encodes the cmap tables correctly, and Fontforge
      should be doing it right as well. Still doesn't work in CS2. What's strange
      is that with the 6-glyph test fonts I'm using, all the correct characters show
      up in the font preview dropdown in Photoshop. When I try to use them in a text
      field, the typeface switches to Myriad Pro.\r\n\r\nHere's another test: http://academic.evergreen.edu/o/orhmeh09/ZTFUpdaterTest.ttf.zip\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
      working with TrueType data makes me want to throw everything I own off a bridge."

  body: "Here's a sample. It's not actually a font that I'd use as input or output
    normally, but my main problem seems to be getting any kind of Turkish glyphs (Gbreve,
    gbreve, Idotaccent, dotlessi, Scedilla, scedilla) to appear in Adobe applications.
    If I can figure out how to make it work in Photoshop, I can just make my code
    do that.\r\n\r\nThe font looks okay with Fontforge and ftxdumperfuser. I haven't
    tested it with Freehand (uses MacTurkish 1-byte encoding) but it's easy to make
    it work. This is a brand new file in Fontforge, I just copied over the 6 glyphs.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a sample from some version of AcademyEngraved belonging to my company. The
    file only includes 6 glyphs, I don't want to get into any trouble for sharing
    copyrighted fonts!\r\n\r\nhttp://academic.evergreen.edu/o/orhmeh09/TestAca.ttf.zip"
