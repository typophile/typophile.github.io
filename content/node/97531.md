  Kepler as headings and body copy mixed with Verlag as title headings. I am not loving
  the font Kepler and want to change it but not too dramatically - any advice much
  appreciated on which alternative font I could use that would mix well with Verlag.
  I have looked at Farnham but fear it may be too trendy for the magazine. It is a
  womans magazine, but for the older generation.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    you choose has a large body set and x-height. My personal favorite\u2014as an
    older generation guy, mind you\u2014is Poppl Laudatio\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/laudatio-be/\r\n\r\nHowever,
    a complete set of this face would be mighty pricey. IMHO, Farnham appears to be
    an acceptable alternate (old broads <em>can</em> be hip, too, you know). Plus,
    the swash italic options are quite ladylike, without being too girly\u2026"
