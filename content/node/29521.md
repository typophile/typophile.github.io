  body: I thought the Guardian redesign was rubbish at the time but I've gotten used
    to it. I felt the same way about the Times when they turned into a tabloid but
    that didn't affect me much since that's my dad's paper not mine, and my Mum is
    a Daily Mail reader through and through, I could just die of embarrassment! I
    saw the Times today and it was the same as it's been. The new design certainly
    is subtle!

  body: Luke - My reaction after seeing just a couple onscreen samples is that the
    headline font is a nice clean redraw of Times Classic. Well done. But the new
    face doesn't work nearly as well for the nameplate, where the wedge serifs are
    far too facile in those very large all-caps. Can you tell us about the decision
    to drop the subtle curves in the brackets there?

    type inspiration derived from an old mid-50's berthold wolpe masthead with strong,
    triangular serifs that I pushed very hard for. It was felt too 'masculine', and
    the lack of brackets caused much consternation. We tried everything from the delicate
    curve to the bracketless wedge, and in true committee style, it ended in middle-ground,
    and with the serifs reduced in weight. The masthead is based on the headline font,
    but is significantly different in detailing."

    because the existing one is great, and it's not nice seeing a body face replaced
    <cite>that</cite> often. That \"after 221 years\" bit is just more spin of course.
    I did enjoy Ellis's elaboration on the coat of arms though. Plus it's nice to
    see mention of logography - the idea only failed because the compositor's union
    sabotaged it. With logography Latin might have become something richer, since
    it's an idea that naturally lends itself to ligation.\r\n\r\nComing to the design
    itself, I actually rather like the masthead. It has a nice newsy edge to it. On
    the other hand I confess to being a sucker for the wedge serif! As for the headline
    face itself, I'd really like to see a PDF. Luke, tell them to submit to newseum.org!
    From the onscreen renditions it looks maybe a bit too \"emotional\", with the
    high contrast and cupped serifs - but I guess that's what a newspaper needs to
    be these days. BTW, it also seems to have a certain Dutch flavor, which is both
    good and bad I guess.\r\n\r\n> I see Luke gets a nod at the banner.\r\n\r\nAnd
