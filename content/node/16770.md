  like to mix it with trade gothic is that good?\r\nWould it be better with Avenir?
  I don't want to use frutiger typeface (I know Adrian Frutiger designed the Avenir)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance"

      is just I designed a logo based on the garamond but then really worked on it
      so it looks quite different\r\nI'd like to work with display typeface that will
      goes with the logo...\r\n\r\nDo you consider Trade as a classic?\r\n\r\n"

    Gamma or ITC Esprit. I don't think a Garamond-Avenir mix would work well. Garamond
    No 3 -- Trade Gothic sounds better. \r\n\r\nA."
