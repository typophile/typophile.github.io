body: Hello. I&#39;m doing a report on how technology and the digitalization of the
  publishing industry has affected the quality &#40;typographic and otherwise&#41;
  of published work. I noticed that quite a few people here are typographers and book
  designers, and that some have been in the industry since the days of the Linotype
  and Monotype machines &#40;Gerald Giampa and Jim Rimmer?&#41;. I was wondering if
  I could get someone else&#39;s opinion on this topic, as many of you are most likely
  much more knowledgable about the issue than I. <BR> <BR>Currently, I&#39;m leaning
  towards the opinion that the reduced learning curve and investment involved in using
  today&#39;s technology compared to technology before the digital era has led to
  a lower overall standard of quality. Of course, the issue is more complicated than
  that &#40;I seem to remember Gerald Giampa once saying that bad type can be set
  using any technology&#41;, but it&#39;s a start. <BR> <BR>Can anyone help, share
  their opinion, or point me to any relevant books or articles? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Andrew

    top-quality work as well as much easier to turn out crap. <BR> <BR>Going digital
    is a minor issue in the overall story of publishing quality. The big question
    is one of economics: will publishers invest a little more time and money into
    quality, or will they heed the imperative of cost minimization as a way to maximize
    profits? <BR> <BR>It used to be that you <i>had</i> to invest some serious labor
    to get a book typeset, no choice. These days, you can run off the Microsoft Word
    manuscript on a high quality laser printer, and get results that many people would
    not be easily able to distinguish from quality typesetting. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also
    not sure how much sense it makes to talk of an overall standard of quality. There&#39;s
    always a range. I savor the experience of encountering fine book from a hundred
    or more years ago, but a lot of books from back then were no better typographically
    than run-of-the-mill books today.'

  body: I&#39;d argue that the lower end of the spectrum has strayed further from
    the general pack &#40;because of the lowered barrier for entry for first-timers,
    uninformed amateurs&#41; while the means of producing that low end has risen,
    so there&#39;s more nicely printed crap. <BR> <BR>Maybe. It&#39;s too early for
    me to articulate this properly.

    <BR> <BR>Gentium is developed by a non-profit Christian outfit. Nafees is a University
    project. I&#39;m guessing that the Native American glyphs of Plantagent had some
    institutional financing. Minion is from Adobe. <BR> <BR>None of these are &#34;speculative&#34;
    retail fonts, such as where an independent foundry would cover the entire R&amp;D
    upfront. I can see that an indie foundry with a really good selling typeface might
    get around to extending its language support -- and that seems to be happening
    with FF Meta, for instance. I&#39;ve produced some OpenType CE versions of some
    of my fonts, but haven&#39;t got around to releasing them on the general market.
    I think the OpenType format will drive this, but it&#39;s early days yet.'

    of a couple of fonts doesn&#39;t solve things. <BR> <BR>Charles'

  body: Wow, something Nick and I actually agree on, more or less. <BR> <BR>Charles,
    the very latest versions of Minion Pro and Myriad Pro do indeed have Vietnamese
    support. This was added last year. <BR> <BR>Although many, many languages can
    each be done with &#34;a few extra glyphs,&#34; all those extra glyphs do add
    up to quite a bit of work. Especially if one is going to consider kerning, and
    small cap versions, and so on. <BR> <BR>If one is a stickler for design quality,
    any of the diacritics which actually attaches to a character is yet more work,
    because additional optical adjustments must be made. You can&#39;t just remove
    overlap and get a nice result. The ogonek and the Vietnamese hook are both good
    examples of this. <BR> <BR>The typeface I&#39;m working on right now would be
    a lot closer to done if I hadn&#39;t kept on saying things like &#34;I&#39;ll
    just throw in Vietnamese, too&#34; &#40;or the extra Latin for the delta between
    CE and WGL4, or whatever&#41;. &#34;It won&#39;t be that much more work.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: '&#62;but have you looked at the glyphs required? <BR> <BR>No. Why should
    I bother? I really don&#39;t believe that there is a market for any of my typefaces
    for setting Vietnamese or Persian &#40;Why isn&#39;t that, like, Iran?&#41;. <BR>Everything
    to do with an independent foundry is incremental, not very significant considered
    in isolation, but one has to prioritize. Everything is competing for attention,
    including yakking on Typophile &#40;except when it&#39;s down&#41;. <BR> <BR>One
    of my next hurdles is getting out OT versions of my back catalogue, possibly with
    CE encoding. I&#39;d prefer to add the typographic extras rather than extra language
    encoding. It&#39;s a real dilemma of what to do, for a small foundry: new fonts
    get the marketing exposure, but all the old ones need to be updated to CE and
    OT. And I don&#39;t consider myself to be overly &#34;Anglo-centric&#34;, after
    all, I am an Anglo. However, I do find many of the CE diacritics fascinating:
    did you know that the slash on the l-slash goes at the top of the ascender in
    scripts? <BR> <BR>I think every foundry should have one face that is a multi-lingual
    workhorse. Maybe two, a sans and a sans serif. I&#39;m working on one at the moment,
    but my loyalty is divided, I&#39;m also spending time on developing fonts which
    utilize contextual alternates -- the aesthetic imperative of OpenType, rather
    than the linguistic one.'

    first-timers, those who genuinely want to learn a craft but can&#39;t pursue it
    through traditional channels &#40;i.e. formal education&#41;, and those who don&#39;t
    care if they produce crap.
