body: "I'm looking for someone to convert a Type 1 font to IBM's proprietary AFP format
  for use on a mainframe printer (IOW, variable data). the catalog of fonts in AFP
  format is surprisingly limited (as far as our rep has informed me). fortunately,
  I was able to uncover enough info about AFP to learn that Type 1 can be repackaged
  in such a way that it will work on this platform.\r\n\r\nas always, our timeline
  is virtually non-existant, so any info would be much appreciated."

    but I'm not sure about licensing issues.
