  credits \"Monotype Design Studio\".  Sebastian Carter's _Twentieth Century Type
  Designers_ says that Stanley Morison directed the Monotype Drawing Office to tweak
  up a proprietary version of Janson, but Ehrhardt has certain idiosyncratic details--most
  notably the curved crossbar of the A--which seem out of character for Morison.  It
  does seem like a particular designer with a particular personality worked on this
  one.  Anyone know who?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nMax"

  body: "There's an interesting essay on Monotype Ehrhardt by Harry Carter in a reprint
    of Stanley Morison's \"A Tally of Types\"; there, Carter tells the story of that
    typeface revival, stating, among other things, that the \"Nonesuch Press had a
    case or two of the 14-point (Didot) [Ehrhardt] in its cellar and set a few small
    books in it from 1927 onwards. Some of the Nonesuch fount eventually found its
    way to Cambridge [to Monotype] ... The type was favoured enough to make the American
    Linotype and Monotype companies cut it for their machines ... Both completed their
    series in 1937\". Carter doesn't quote any specific designer or punch-cutters,
    but adds that in 1937 Morison started working on a \"different treatment\" of
    the type, named \"Series 453\", which in the ned, in Carter's words, resulted
    in \"an exercise in making a Fleischman out of a Kis\". Again, there's no mention
    of any cutter. So it seems that the first Monotype version was faithfully based
    on the Nonesuch Press cut, while the second one was more an interpretation given
    by Morison? Anyway, I suggest to everyone to get copy of \"A Tally of Types\",
    it is a wonderfully written and beautifully typeset book, even if one doesn't
    agree with Morison's vision or statements.\r\n"

    Monotype Ehrhardt, as well as many other typefaces that came out of machine-setting
    company drawing offices in the early part of the 20th century, are excellent team
    efforts. '

    monotype ehrhardt... I remember I did some research and found out who it was designed
    by.. but i completely forgot his name and the book I found it in :<, I''ll do
    a quick check later on tonight, all I remember is he was Hungarian, I remember
    that detail because the story is set in Austria-Hungary during ww1 so I thought
    that was the reason they chose a typeface designed by a Hungarian. '

    a reference to Mikl\xF3s (Nicholas) T\xF3tfalusi Kis, the 17th Century Hungarian
    punchcutter who studied and worked for a time in Amsterdam. Erhardt is inspired
    by Kis' types, but it is not a direct revival of any one of them."

  body: "I know there is a titling typeface from 1967 to accompany Ehrhardt. The Monotype
    Corporation named it Fleet Titling (Series 632) and it was designed by British
    designer John Peters (1917- 1989). He also designed Angelus 1953, Castellar 1957
    and Traveller 1964. Fleet Titling also includes the same curved crossbar in the
    A, like in Ehrhardt.\r\n\r\nI don't know why it was called Fleet. Maybe because
    in 1904 Monotype took offices at 43 Fetter Lane, off Fleet Street in London. But
    some 20 years ago I also saw a picture of a van that Monotype used to conduct
    their business. The lettering on these vans (the fleet, there you are) was done
    in Fleet Titling.\r\n\r\nThere must be someone who knows more about Fleet Titling.\r\n"

    Titling.  Can't find it in any of my old metal specimen books, but since they're
    mostly American, I'm not that surprised.\r\n\r\nDan, I certainly don't assume
    that all typefaces have single designers.  But the old Monotype Drawing Office
    was famously uptight--Eric Gill used to complain that they'd replace his waisted
    stems with ruler-straight ones because straight lines are neater--and I just can't
    see one of those good soldiers curving that crossbar on his/her own.  Nor have
    I ever seen an old sample of Kis/Janson with a detail like that.  \r\n\r\nSii,
    thank you so much for inviting Robin Nicolas to this party."

  body: What I found very interesting in Harry Carter's essay in <em>A Tally of Types</em>
    is that on page 171 of the first volume of Updike's <em>Printing Types</em> a
    type by Kis, then unknown to Morison, is reproduced which was modified from the
    original Kis/Janson for the purpose of achieving the same goals as Ehrhardt was.

  body: "Eric Gill was a bit of an eccentric, and was not as experienced in producing
    actual typeface as some other type designers of his day would have been. So, I
    think that his comments about the Drawing Office should be taken with a grain
    of salt. I also doubt, for instance, that Gill Sans would have ever turned out
    nearly as well as it did in small sizes without the excellent work of the Drawing
    Office. Of course, this is something of a counterfactual, because without Morison
    and Monotype's interest, there would not have been a sans serif typeface from
    Gill anyway, just some larger-sized lettering pieces in this style. \r\n\r\nI
    think that the Drawing Office was better than they often get credit for. Some
    of the details of their reputation may have also come from Morison's writings,
    especially his later writings, as he famously did not get on so well with Frank
    H. Pierpont, the Works manager for many years. Pierpont and his team were capable
    of producing quality typefaces without any input from Morison at all, as can be
    seen in the typefaces they produced in the decade before Morison's appointment
    as typographical adviser (Imprint, Plantin, and maybe Monotype Garamond, too,
    depending on whose timeline you believe)."

  body: "Fred Goudy had the exact same complaint, about the workers straightening
    out his curves, as Gill.\r\n(In <em>Goudy's Type Designs</em> about Garamont.)\r\nBut
    Goudy was an experienced type designer at the time, with Kennerley under his belt,
    and the company was Lanston Monotype, which IIRC had a U.S. drawing office.\r\n\r\nThat
    would tend to support  Max's observation that the assembly line was inherently
    conservative and unimaginative. Given the hierarchical structure of industrial
    production, one would expect every letter drawn by a worker to be signed off by
    a lower-level manager (a sergeant major, following the R&R to a T), and that more
    general design direction be provided by senior management.\r\n\r\nAlthough punch
    cutters worked in anonymity in the 19th century (e.g. the mysterious \"man in
    black\"), before the era of the pantograph and engineering drawings, even at the
    larger foundries they had some autonomy to introduce personality quirks into typefaces,
    and one can see this in the variation of letter form between different sizes of
    the same typeface."

    Google Books directly through the text in the print sample which (in the original
    book, as opposed to the much more common Dover reprint, which doesn't preserve
    the blank pages on the backs of the plates) faces page 170. So I <em>think</em>
    that's the one that Harry Carter was talking about, and the fact that a Kis revival
    type is very similar to it helps to confirm that."

    of Monotype) was involved in the development of Ehrhardt. The account by Harry
    Carter in the 1973 'Tally of Types' seems pretty accurate to me. I think it was
    Morison's take on Janson - made a little heavier and narrower to give improved
    legibility and economy.\r\n\r\nThe project started in 1936 and was originally
    called 'Old Hollandische' but Morison scrapped the first trial, which had been
    based on 'Janson Antiqua 12pt', and re-started the work in 1937, based on a different
    model.\"\r\n"
