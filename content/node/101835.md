  body: It doesn't appear to match any well-known typeface. It might help if you could
    identify its source (company, website, document with information, or whatever).  -

  body: "It looks awfully familiar, especially that relatively rare -and very nice-
    ampersand form. The \"y\" and \"g\" ring bells too.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, there
    appears to be a faux-Bold applied.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
