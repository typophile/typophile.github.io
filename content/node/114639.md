  body: Can't find a match. Logo design by [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/30-Type-Only-Logos/12051237|Higher]].
    But I guess, as Higher is well-known for his custom logo, it could be totally
    hand-drawn. Your best chance is probably asking directly. And for what it's worth,
    it reminds me of [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=Abraham%20Lincoln|Abraham
    Lincoln]], stretched and reconstructed /t from /l?
