  body: I'm at TypeCon, so I don't have my type specimen books with me, but I think
    this is Gill Sans with alternate characters that were designed to make it look
    more like Futura. A number of metal sans types had alternates like that.

  body: "That's definitely possible as I've heard people say that the main titles
    were Gil Sans (and the M certainly looks like a Gil Sans M). The R is what made
    me think it couldn't be Gil Sans however.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my next question is:
    does a digital version exist? \r\n\r\nI'm trying to build some titles for a 2001
    thing I'm working on and matching the typeface is going to be somewhat key, after
    all those Kubrick nerds can be NASTY!"

  body: The M and W are quite different, the latter of which looks custom because
    of the wide stance and slightly lower mid-apex (I've never referred to that part
    of anatomy so I don't know it's technical name!). So I'm not sure, but it does
    look a custom modification of Futura.

  body: "I agree with Scott. The W seems custom, and the M looks borrowed from Gill
    (the tops of the stems are flat, unlike the N, which I think shows it may be from
    a different typeface). The round G, the R and the N are all Futura, to me.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Gill with Futura-esque alternates seems like it could be right. Re: Kubrick
    nerds, I seemed to remember some related discussion over at alt.movies.kubrick
    and just found it again; basically people there are either saying it's some version
    of Futura (with a rogue M), or some version of Gill (with other changes). I think
    the latter is probably more likely.\r\nSome links for reference:\r\n<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/alt.movies.kubrick/browse_thread/thread/816521c466386599/a79b633b64cade73\">2001

  body: "In the pre-digital age (and <em>2001</em> was pre-digital by some 15 years),
    movie titles had to be photographed from a hard-copy original. To use type for
    this was needlessly difficult, as it would have required having a printer set
    up your titles in metal type (the largest sizes they had) and printing a one-off
    reproduction proof to be photographed. It was much easier to hire an artist to
    handletter titles, and most movie titles were handlettered until the 1960s. \r\nBy
    the late 1960s, Photolettering was around, and might have been used for the <em>2001</em>
    titles. Changing fonts in the middle of a word would have been a pain in the a55,
    but nevertheless possible, and it's the sort of fussy detail I could easily imagine
    Kubrick insisting on."

    found those pointy bits on the A, N, M, etc. to be distracting. I like this customized
    version quite a lot to be honest.\r\n\r\nI just wish there was a digital version
    so I dont have to cut/paste each letter manually to get what I'm after."

  body: "The typeface certainly has the \"feel\" of Gill Sans, in a lighter version,
    even if the shapes of some specific letters indicate otherwise.\r\n\r\nSo I would
    look at the various sans-serif typefaces that were in use in Britain at the time.\r\n\r\nApparently,
    though, what happened was that the titles were done in the U.S., and thus, Gill
    Sans wasn't handy... and for a typeface with a similar feel to that (or maybe
    to Futura) it looks like they used Intertype's Vogue. At least, [[http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/12605|Am
    Sans]], said to resemble Vogue, looks like these titles."

    is quite similar to Neutraface which might also work but again it's that gosh-darned
    M (which I could potentially just steal from Gil but it would probably look like
    I did just that)\r\n"

  body: "The more I look at this, the more I think this is just Futura with some custom
    Gill Sans-like characters (A, N, M, V, W). The custom letters don't quite match
    Gill Sans, but the others are exact matches for Futura. There is a slight unevenness
    in the spacing that suggests to me that it was film setting (or maybe process
    lettering), and not metal type. The presence of custom letters also points to
    this.\r\n\r\nIf this was the case, you're not likely to find an exact match (or
    even a close match) in an existing digital font. Although you could try combining
    Futura and Gill Sans, assuming you could match the size and weights."

  body: 'Frode Frank is right. This is Futura. Period. The complete font came with
    four different versions of M. One was the classic splayed m, two had the central
    V glyph come down to the baseline (one with a point at the bottom, the other flat),
    and the fourth was the M shown on this post. All the other characters in the titles
    are standard Futura.  '

    don''t look very much like the ones in the end titles of the movie. For example,
    there''s a straight-sided Futura M that''s similar to the one in question, but
    the joins at the top and middle are pointed, not clipped off. Have you got a specimen
