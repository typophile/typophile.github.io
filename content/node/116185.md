body: Hi guys, this is a follow up post to the previous one. I have made changes based
  on suggestions received. A. and B. were the old logos. C. and D. are new with more
  legible company's name. My company will be selling fashion accessories, mostly scarves.
  Targeting women between 28-35. Moderate discretionary income. Let me know what you
  guys think.

  body: Hi Tannathan! I think you made the right choice by including your name in
    the logotype. A logo's most important quality is that is has to be legible, and
    your first logo you showed us acted more as an abstract logomark. I would suggest
    making the logotype larger since the type is always more important than the mark
    for communication unless you're a major brand like McDonalds or Starbucks. I think
    the mark would look nice if it was 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the type.
