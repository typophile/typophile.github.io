body: I&#39;m working on logo and ad guidelines for a cargo company, and I was wondering
  if anyone could help me out on capitalization norms for Spanish. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  referring specifically to slogans, by-lines, department names, that sort of thing.  I
  know that English usually capitalizes all words except pronouns and short prepositions;
  French capitalizes only the first word.  How about Espa

  body: From what i know &#40;I&#39;m a native spanish speaker, but not an expert
    in the field&#41;, in titles &#40;of books, documents, etc.&#41; only the first
    word is capitalized &#40;first names excepted, of course&#41;. The same should
    apply for slogans and such things.
