body: "Hi guys, I am currently working on a typography project and desperately seeking
  inspiration. This quote by the great Milton Glaser 'Computers are to design as microwaves
  are to cooking' is my starting point and I am to create a typeface to enhance the
  semantic meaning of the words and create emotion. I am to consider the shape and
  form of each letterform as well as what materials to use to express my chosen quote.
  The brief encourages to use either/or all hand drawn, hand made, illustrated, painted,
  scratched, sewn, constructed, three dimensional type. We may combine the type with
  images but allow the letterforms to focus on the design. Overall broaden the sense
  of meaning of the words.\r\n\r\nSo research has taken me to obvious ideas and food
  for thought so far, like - radiation as the typeface / use of computer and microwave
  food related typefaces and symbols / microwave parts and components / Milton Glaser
  typefaces like stencil / microwave food packaging / circuit boards and computer
  parts / using the computer desktop or/and icons / using blur-motion to create speed
  / even microwaving computers and parts!....\r\n\r\nI haven't hit the nail on the
  head yet but would very much welcome any input any one might have on this topic?!\r\n"

    (too many under forty today can not cook a decent meal if their life dependet
    on it), computer has \u2013 like microwave, by lowering the standard \u2013 eaten
    away the classic knowledge and craft of typographic design.\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps
    you should just do a really poor job in 120 seconds. :\xB7)"

  body: "What about the tactile? Seems microwave cooking is a sort of hands-off, no
    mess, no fuss way of cooking--sort of like the difference between kneading dough
    by hand and using an electric mixer instead. I don't think that the difference
    is as extreme between pencil and paper vs. computer, but there is still a tactile
    difference. \r\nThe computer is a tool, but it's a different kind of tool, there
    seems more distance between the hand and the letterform."

    times he made that comment, Glaser had valid point. With the introduction of digital
    technology, much of the graphic design being created was essentially a reheated,
    re-served version of what had been made earlier, using traditional methods.......\"\r\n\r\nand
    the rest: Digital illustration by Lawrence Zeegen (p.66)."

    \u201CPeople read best what they read most,\u201D the phrase has become one of
    those notorious moments in design punditry that was rehashed out of context until
    it took on a new meaning. It\u2019s no longer relevant because Milton Glaser said
    it. It\u2019s relevant because people resort to quotes when they want to be dismissive
    but can\u2019t or won\u2019t come up with a good argument."

  body: "I'm surprised this thread went on this long without someone noting that not
    only are computers bad for type design, but so is the pantograph. Fonts should
    be designed by punch-cutting!\r\n\r\nThat battle, though, I think, has been lost.
    The general public, whatever one might think of its standards of taste, is much
    too used to the slickness of today's typefaces to accept the results of punch-cutting
    by hand. They will accept that Aldus' Hypnerotomachia Poliphilii was an improvement
    on what came before, but even while acknowledging its beauty, they will still
    resolutely prefer, say, Times Roman for normal use.\r\n\r\nThat being said, though,
    it does seem to me that computer type design is in its infancy. I would prefer
    to draw letters on paper, and then measure them, and locate reference points in
    the letters I create by number, at least in some cases, than try to design a font
    by drawing directly on the computer screen with a mouse. And the fact that all
    the major outline font standards restrict one to using only spline curves rather
    than (at least for classic Roman fonts) being able to explicitly demand a conic
    section (never mind Melior, based on Piet Hein's superellipse) is a problem as
    well."
