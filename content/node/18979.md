body: I am designing a mini-book that i will be typesetting my senior paper into,
  which is about crossword puzzles, and I am really struggling with the typeface choice.
  I am currently using Ehrhardt but it seems too heavy on the grey paper I am printing
  on. I think i started with Century, which again was just too heavy. I don't quite
  want to go with the obvious Times New Roman. Does anyone have any suggestions on
  faces the would lend the "newspaper" look to my mini-book?

  body: I second the Lido notion. It prints better on newsprint than many expensive
    text faces and it's definitely got more character than Times.
