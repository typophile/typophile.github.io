  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear typophiles,   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what follows is something I've done a few years ago    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as a kind of warm-up exercise before a very different    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->job (which didn't turn out as expected BTW). I only    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->did then part of the lowercase set (the easier glyphs ;),   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and five or six UC letters. Recently, I've come across    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->these files again and wondered if it would be worth the    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trouble to revive and complete them.    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What do you think?   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There were three versions, which I'm calling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,    <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->soft<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sharp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version was the less    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->incomplete, so it's the only one I'm displaying here.    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->soft<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version would naturally be the one more    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->appropriate for text (well, would it?). I compare   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the three below.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->soft<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version is of course the most difficult and    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->demanding. I had a vision of how it should be, but    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->haven't been competent enough to do it back then    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(or rather I didn't invest the necessary time on it).    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I guess <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sharp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the sexiest baby to me. ;)   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->General or specific comments are welcome.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodolfo, this is very nice - although I do have a weakness for semi-serifs. There's a bit of Unger, a bit of Granjon, and a bit of Times in there. But the result is totally original. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I won't go into specific glyphs (yet). What I'd point out is that I think you need to make some text versus display decisions here (as you're already prepared to do, it seems). For example, the Sharp and the Hard are very well suited to display work (at large and moderate sizes, respectively), so the narrowness is right on. I agree that the color and contrast of the Soft make it the most suitable for text (while maintaining that rigidity I for one find priceless), but there the degree of narrowness will act against readability too much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other thing I'd point out is that you're <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mostly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> avoiding the classic problem with semi-serifs: backslant. The delicacy of your serifs helps. But do consider putting slight swells* on the other sides of the semi-serifs, especially in the display cuts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* But definitely not mushy ones like in Avance. Look at FF Profile, or maybe Proforma. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; But the drill work involved in making a complete face bores me big time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some font houses are willing to apply their in-house designers towards the completion of a promising font, although your cut of any profits would go down. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; You know I like Times, don't you? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like it too, but only for display. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Smeijers's theory <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It doesn't make sense, because we read boumas, and that relies on tight spacing. Loose spacing is in fact the main weakness in Eureka and Rotis. Smeijers might be talking about very small sizes? There greater letterspacing is indeed more important, but so is large apparent size: if you save horizontal space through narrowness, you'll need to make it up through a larger point size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The general view concerning narrowness is that it causes a drop in legibility through decreased decipherability of individual letters, but that's also misguided. The real problem is two-fold: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Bouma decipherability relies heavily on the overall width of the silhouette, and narrowness causes a decrease in the absolute difference of width in the lexicon of boumas. In the parafovea, the best way to tell apart &quot;dearly&quot; and &quot;dastardly&quot; for example is through their width primarily (and the second &quot;d&quot;'s ascender secondarily). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Too much narrowness also puts a given bouma too far outside familiarity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, do you think Patria is wide or narrow? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You might be surprised that it's more economical than Times&hellip; The trick is the massive counters.

Roman relies in large part    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the baseline for stability and balance. You can call that static    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->equilibrium. Italics, on the other hand, has a sort of &quot;dynamic    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->equilibrium&quot; (isn't this perhaps the most important difference between    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->them?), even though it's of course also sitting on a virtual baseline.    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you have a &quot;flat-foot&quot; (roman) half-serif it seems as if the glyph's    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->center of gravity isn't quite supported by the base and it tends to fall.    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The same effect doesn't happen in a &quot;carolingian&quot; half-serif as the base    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is not what supports it to begin with.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only thing that I would like to ask you is that your l/c (k)    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don't need a cursive terminal on the leg of the letter? like you    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->use on the stroke of the same letter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ricardo: well, that would be a different design. I like the contrast   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when the shapes, instead of acknowledging the pen, suddenly seem   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to acknowledge the brush (thus annoying Hrant even more ;).   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->i looked at it again, and now i realize that hard k seems very    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->different (the arms' proportions) from sharp k. i think sharp k    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is ok. but hard k still bothers me: doesn't it look too wide in    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;ikko tanaka&quot;?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe, Eduardo - isn't that an image artifact? I think it's more or    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->less the same. The &quot;sharp&quot; version is lighter, in any case.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that this k is somewhat polemic. Just to give the due    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->credit: its design is partly derived from the famous gala portrait    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of Louis XIV by Hyacinthe Rigaud. Look it up and you'll see how.  ;)</div>
