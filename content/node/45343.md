    and 40\u20AC by train away!).\r\n\r\nSeriously though, enjoy it.  The architecture
    is the main draw of the city.  What's your primary reason to visit?  Just vacation
    work or?\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos

    to network.

    Olympics (the one in 2004, I mean)... It should be lovely this time of the year.
    I envy you, as I only got to visit during the hottest summer months.

    um.. well there's Gaudi which is supposed to be fabulous. And it is I guess if
    your are interested in medieval-style production methods. Since architects and
    urban planners have forgotten that buildings and streets, and indeed cities are
    for people, Barcelona is like most larger city: a place you just want to get out
    of after a while.\r\nBut sure, I'm always up for a coffee if you feel like ;)\r\n\r\n/Fredrik"
