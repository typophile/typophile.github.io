  the \"Dalit Freedom Network\". The \"Dalit\" are the untouchables from India that
  are below the caste system, and this organization is lobbying for their freedom.
  \r\n\r\nThis is what I have been playing with... I'd appreciate your thoughts and
  feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJesse\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dalitnetwork.jpg]"

  body: "The top one seems a little better, however, there is something strange about
    the space between first D and the chain, maybe offsetting chain lower could help\u2026As
    is, I read it more as \u201CCalit\u201D with \u201CC\u201D inverted on purpose,
    so you have to improve the readability of \u201CD\u201D. Also, as your tracking
    is pretty tight, the area between \u201Cali\u201D becomes a little problematic. "

  body: "Jesse,\r\n\r\nI like what you did with \u201CD\u201D in the top one, but
    spacing of the chain still needs work. Tracking is much better now. Putting the
    chain in the negative space makes it look like a bit heavy and has a mechanical
    feel to it. Overall, even in the positive space, the chain feels a little on the
    heavy side, but I know you want to keep the same thinness as the type\u2026Keep
    pushing it a bit further\u2026what do other people think ?\r\n\r\nJen\r\n"

  body: "Jesse,\r\n\r\nThis is just a quick idea. Maybe keep the chain lined up with
    the d. It seems too distracting with the chain not lined up. If you do have the
    broken-chain angled the way you currently have it, I suggest use it reversed out.
    I think your negative space mock-ups aren't bad. Maybe shorten the d and get rid
    of the small stem.\r\n\r\nI also think a dark orange would be a good color for
    the chain, since orange is a national color. Maybe a warm grey for the type.\r\n\r\nThe
    space between the \"i\" and the \"t\" bothers me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dal.gif]"

  body: "If you want to make it less corporate, then change the font of the name.
    The tag doesn't fit the logo. You don't have to be stuck with the corporate sans
    serif font. Pick a sans serif that has more character in it. Then make the chain
    graphic fit the type.\r\n\r\nI'll try and think of some."

    u/l case and then extend it beyond Dalit. Everything doesn't have to line up.

    between the logo and tagline. That would be flexible enough to use on any application.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    when you have the elements justified with the left of the \"D\", it makes the
    chain not as dominant, plus it makes the break-line more obvious.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dalit5.gif]"
