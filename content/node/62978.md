  and am looking for hi resolution images of signs and signpainters throughout history
  for use in the book. I have done countless google and flickr searches, but some
  of the best stuff I've found ( http://theletterheads.com/lhparts/atkinsonmain.html
  http://theletterheads.com/lhparts/halsted.html http://typography.com/images/blogImages/berenice-abbott.jpg
  http://typography.com/images/blogImages/drawing_office.jpg) are just not high enough
  quality.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on where to get some premium quality signpainting images?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance. You guys are the best."

    take pics. That was really cool, and he was a big help. He even gave me a little
    tutorial. Really nice guy ( http://www.jeffcanham.com/ ), but I'm still looking
    for old photos.\r\n\r\nThanks for the response!"
