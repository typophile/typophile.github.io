  I'm thinking condensed slabserifs etc. I've attached an image of the look the client
  is going for, but I don't think it's a particularly good example. I'd also be keen
  to hear of any modern takes on the style. If anyone has any suggestions it'd be
  much appreciated.\r\nthanks,\r\nHD\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amy_martin_2_6545.jpg]"
