  doing some work for these people and we can't seem to locate the font. It's not
  Snell Roundhand or Copperplate Script. I e-mailed them and they said it was Shelley
  Volante but it looks more like Shelley Allegro, but still not a perfect match. Do
  you think they originally used a knock-off? Or maybe I just can't find the correct
  version? Thanks for everyone's help!"
