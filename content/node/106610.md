    by Ferdinand Theinhardt, which was the antecessor of Akzidenz Grotesk. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FerdinandTheinhardt--AkzidenzGrotesk-1898_4360.jpg]\r\n<em>(Image
    provided by Luc Devroye)</em>\r\n\r\nLook also for \xBBScheltersche Grotesk\xAB
    or \xBBGrotesk\xAB by Schelter & Giesecke. <a href=\"http://www.christianschwartz.com/bau.shtml\">FF
    Bau</a> by Christian Schwartz is a digital interpretation of it. Hope that helps
    you for finding the exact one \u2026 "

  body: Thanks Renko, the angle of the S terminals lead me to think it's not Royal
    Grotesk. Scheltersche Grotesk etc also looks close but is a little narrower than
    the sample. I'll keep digging.

  body: "I think it could be Royal Grotesk as Renko suggests. \r\nPerhaps from the
    age of photo setting. See the lack of kerning in the scan.\r\n\r\nThe sample of
    Royal Grotesk that Renko provided is most likely of a digitized typeface and thus
    many details could have been altered when redrawing it. "

  body: as I said I'm not an expert but I can't see any differences between the royal
    grotesk provided by renko and the usual akzidenz. aren't they the same? thanks.
