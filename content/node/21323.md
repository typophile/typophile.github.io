body: Does OpenType allow for automatic old style figures within regular text copy?
  This would be a huge advantage for our designers, as they have to manually convert
  all numerals in our publications to old style.

  body: Sure, in a way. Your designers can select the entire text (rather than just
    the numerals) and select Oldstyle Fgures from the OT menu. Or make a stylesheet.

  body: "Open type alone cannot do this. It provides the opportunity for oldstyle
    figures, but does not implement them in any way.\r\n\r\nIt will depend on your
    application program to decide what Open Type features you can access, and how.
    I know InDesign will allow you to do what you want, but if you use another program,
    you might not be able to."

  body: It isn't automatic in the sense that the application can tell the difference
    between body copy and display copy and know which numeral style to use, but OpenType
    will make this simpler for you. In InDesign you just select the text (or the whole
    document, or set the default numeral style for new stories, etc.) and apply the
    appropriate numeral style from the OpenType menu. Of course, this is presuming
    that the particular OpenType font you are using contains the appropriate numerals.

  body: Sounds like it should work; the font we use for our publications includes
    old style numerals. Thanks for the insight.
