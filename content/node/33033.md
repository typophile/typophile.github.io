  body: I don't think it is a match, but <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=truesdell&site=d&btnG=Go">Truesdell</a>
    has similar qualities.

  body: "The whole layout is from the first (1934) American edition of \"Ulysses\",
    designed by Ernst Reichel \u2014 according to Ned Drew & Paul Sternberger's \"By
    Its Cover\u2014Modern American Book Cover Design\" (Princeton Arcitectural Press,
    2005).\r\nThe initials look indeed very much like Truesdell but I think they must
    be hand-lettered. The text face may be Baskerville."

  body: "Is there a more common typeface that you think I could pass for Truesdell
    or the handlettered S? I am working on a logo concept that is based on the big
    S page, but it uses a J instead of the S.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help,\r\n\r\nDuncan"
