  body: "Here's another image.\r\ni was convinced it was Caslon or Garamond, The \"S\"
    are def closer to Garamond, but the \"9\"s have something interesting going on
    that tells me otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd the whole \"Open Face\" thing, isn't helping
    me narrow my options.\r\n\r\nThanks Guys![img:sites/default/files/old-images/yo_4678.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think i found it. \"Smaragd\u2122 Regular\" . confirm? thanks."
