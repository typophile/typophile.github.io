  am working on a manual and some advertisements. I would like to use Excelsior for
  both body text and headline. I need to find Excelsior a good partner to dance with
  (hopefully one that can do headlines and body text as well) and was wondering if
  anyone has any suggestions. \r\n\r\nRight now I have Franklin Gothic as its partner.
  I think the colors complement each other. But Franklin Gothic is narrower in width
  making it seem a bit condensed when set next to Excelsior.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly
  appreciated!!\r\n\r\nnewbie"

    Excelsior I am speaking about is a digital rendition done by Linotype. I originally
    wanted to use the Arnhem but its too expensive. So the closest one I came across
    that has a few similar characteristics to Arnhem is Excelsior which so happen
    it is something the client already owns.  \r\n\r\nBeing that Arnhem is my first
    choice does anyone have any recommendation on another font that is closest to
    it?\r\n"
