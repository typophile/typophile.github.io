  body: "Your sample appears to be a typeface based on the standard sans face used
    in Leroy lettering templates. My take on the face is here, although there are
    a few subtle differences, most notably in the uppercase A\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/planscribe-nf/"

  body: "Thanks for your reply!\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a tricky one does this. I
    have compared it to DIN Rounded Regular and that's not a million miles away, neither
    is Vag Rounded, so I'm sure between us we have come up with a good comparison.
    Thanks again :D"
