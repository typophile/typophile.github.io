body: I have a client that would like to continue using a logo which was originally
  created using the free true type font &#40;air millhouse italic&#41; on a PC. <BR>I
  work on a Mac and will need to use this logo for having his letterhead and business
  card printed. <BR>Is there a converter to make that font postscript or should I
  use a program like illustrator to make a EPS image or photoshop to make a tiff image  of
  that logo and then import it in quark? <BR>I would appreciate any advice. <BR>Thanks,
  <BR>bbpal

  body: You can read the PC font into a typeface editor like Fontographer and then
    re output as a Mac font. If you don&#39;t have such a utility it might be easier
    to make the logo into a vector file -- which it should probably be anyway. <BR>
    <BR>There is also the possibility -- which I have encountered myself -- where
    the free font is actually a ripoff of a commercial font. Looking at this <a href="http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=466">Air
    Millhouse</a>, it looks awfully familiar. Does anyone recognize it? I bet it&#39;s
    a ripoff with a couple of cheesy alternate caps. If this is the case, it might
    be easier and/or more ethical to simply license the commercial version.

  body: Eww! This font is just bad. Do your client a favor and recommend a better
    font... perhaps one with less out-of-whack stroke contrast and curves that are
    under control. <BR> <BR>Nothing personal Barbara, its just that can&#39;t see
    how your&#39;ll be able to create anything good for your client with a tool that
    is as bad as this one.

    can help you if you can&#39;t solve the problem.
