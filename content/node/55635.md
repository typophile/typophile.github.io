    from previous jobs.

  body: Download? This is a job that calls for serious research. Go buy as many 6-packs
    as you can. Drink them, and you will see the right answer.

  body: Sorry, Mark. We were all a bit frivolous. You, the designer, should not have
    to worry about that.  As with any packaging die-form, it's up to the production
    people to decide and supply you with, because the costs involved vary (glue, no
    glue, locks, etc.). Please find out who is going to do the printing and ask them.

  body: "If you do it yourself do mock ups on the actual stock and test it out. I
    have always had to work with dies to perfect them.\r\n\r\nYou might suggest that
    you will charge if they can\u2019t provide a die. That is usually a good motivator."
