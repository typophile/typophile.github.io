body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nsome pics from my work on a font for my webpage destinated for very
  small sizes around 9px.\r\nI am struggling with balancing hinting for small screen
  sizes, special versions for negative use on black ground with sub pixel rendering
  and so on\u2026[img:sites/default/files/old-images/84y_5498.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/s3ya_6485.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/yga_4154.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/e7as_6084.png]\r\n\r\nIn
  this pic one can see the results comparing (for now only) two browsers Google Chrome
  and Safari both on Mac.\r\n\r\nFor me the first one is the best, yet it is achieved
  with a particular thinner version of the same font only for the use on black ground.
  Otherwise as known sub pixel rendering tends to make fonts look much bolder than
  they are in reality.\r\nYet, it creates a hell of difficulties when used in animated
  texts, even if only a simple fade, for example. Specially Safari renders the font
  abruptly after the animation is completely done. I tried to change classes in order
  to keep the thicker version while animating, only exchanging it at the end and so
  on. In general it works better with CSS transitions but even this does not solve
  entirely the problem.\r\n\r\nBetween the second and the third one (with simple greyscale
  anti-aliasing) Google is way better, specially the strokes are more consistent as
  here in the example in the \u2018in\u2019. Sadly not even a good hinting solves
  the problem on stroke inconsistency on monitor. Yet the font looks better in Google
  Chrome.\r\n\r\nBy the way Firefox does not leave to the developer the choice of
  greyscale anti-aliasing, as far as I know. One has to do a CSS hack to change class
  for him and go for slighter font versions on dark ground.\r\n\r\nA long story\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/results_3817.png]"

    location is shown by the main hands, which enable the second time zone to be read
    directly. The self-winding Caliber 9909 MC differs from standard multiple time
    zone movements in that its cities disc is completely integrated into the <em><strong><a

    Franck Muller</a></strong></em> and is visible in a lateral magnifier on the 9
    o\u2019clock side of the case, rather than on the dial. This clever mechanism
    avoids overloading the dial. The time in each of the 24 reference cities is read
    by pressing the pivoting push-piece <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.waxreplicawatches.co.uk\">replica
    breitling uk</a></strong></em>. Each press reveals a different city, its local
    time, and the time difference between the home time and the traveler\u2019s time."
