    starting to look like sort of a badge/crest, but maybe soften the look of it a
    bit and make it a little more "kid friendly".

    objects like a spotlight, pen, brush, ladder and so on but it didin't really work

    moving the mask eye back and forth so I'll probably modify it some more. I think

    is an older idea that I had but realized now that it might be a better direction.
    I made the mask look \"painted\" which is supposed to symbolize creativity. I
    also noticed that it with a color scheme like this it adds a mysterious wuality
    to it which I quite like. And for some reason the owl looks a lot more curious
    and inexperienced while the mask looks more experienced and adult. I think this
    works quite well to represent the student and how they grow.\r\n\r\nAlso merged

    the hair added I don't think it will be such a problem anymore.\r\n\r\nI already
    have a version with another curve just haven't posted it here yet, then add my
