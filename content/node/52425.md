body: "Hi folks. I'm in the process of teaching myself to make fonts in FontForge,
  and I thought I'd start with a fairly simple project: converting some resource-fork
  fonts to OpenType format.\r\n\r\nI started with a family of Cochin containing the
  usual Roman, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic. Everything seems to work perfectly,
  except that the Bold Italic shows up in InDesign's font list as \"BoldItalic\" (no
  space). When I preview the font in Windows, I see the space. If I change the \"Name
  For Humans\" field in FontForge to \"Test,\" it reads as \"Cochin Test\" in the
  Windows preview but still as \"BoldItalic\" in InDesign.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that
  InDesign is reading a different field for the name of the font, but I can't figure
  out what or where it is. Can anyone tell me? Thanks."

    field, if present. If it is absent, they fall back to NameID=2. NameID=2 is what
    you'll be seeing in Windows preview, I expect.\r\n\r\nWith any luck the FontForge
    documentation will have enough info to tell you which of its fields correspond
    to these values.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
