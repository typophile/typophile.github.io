  script]] refers to Arabic-based orthographies used for writing African languages.\r\n\r\nAjami
  texts traditionally held less prestige than Arabic texts, and the use of Ajami has
  been generally on the decline since colonial times Latin-based orthographies were
  introduced for these languages. In recent times, though, Ajami may be spreading
  in many areas through print and electronic media. And Ajami texts represent a largely
  unexamined body of literature that may provide fascinating insights into societies
  that are popularly conceived as having been illiterate (indeed, under colonial rule,
  a person who knew how to write in Ajami but not in the Latin-based orthography would
  have been considered illiterate).\r\n\r\nThe African Online Digital Library has
  a collection of Ajami texts for viewing in the West African languages of Fulani,
  J\xF3ola Fo\xF1i, and Wolof, together with transcriptions and translations into
  English and French:\r\n\r\n[[http://westafricanislam.matrix.msu.edu/ajami/index.php]]\r\n\r\nSince
  I know very little about the Arabic script, I have a number of questions for the
  experts here. Does Unicode currently cover all the modified letters needed for representing
  these Ajami texts? Are there widely available Arabic fonts that are suitable for
  representing Ajami texts for scholarly or everyday purposes? I have a feeling that
  since there are several different Ajami systems each with different modifications
  to the basic Arabic letters, current Arabic fonts would be inadequate. What would
  be the ideal typographic solution for Ajami? What style of script would be preferable
  based on these samples?\r\n\r\nI realize it is difficult to answer these questions
  with a few low-resolution samples of a script in languages most of you don't know,
  but I'd love to hear what people make of the Ajami script."

  body: "<em>Does Unicode currently cover all the modified letters needed for representing
    these Ajami texts?</em>\r\n\r\nYes, I believe so. Anything missing at this stage
    would be rare and/or poorly documented.\r\n\r\n<em>Are there widely available
    Arabic fonts that are suitable for representing Ajami texts for scholarly or everyday
    purposes?</em>\r\n\r\nThe Adobe Arabic fonts, which ship with Acrobat 7.0.5 and
    later and are available for purchase from the Adobe type site, should cover all
    the necessary characters. The MS Arabic Typesetting font might also, although
    I think some characters have been added to Unicode since this font was last updated.\r\n\r\nThe
    Tasmeem plug-in fonts for InDesign ME should also work for all these languages.\r\n\r\nNote
    that in all these cases, I'm talking about the suitability of fonts from a technical
    perspective, i.e. Unicode characters support and appropriate layout.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    have a feeling that since there are several different Ajami systems each with
    different modifications to the basic Arabic letters, current Arabic fonts would
    be inadequate.</em>\r\n\r\nA lot of Arabic fonts support only the Arabic, Persian
    (Farsi) and Urdu character sets, since these represent the minimum set defined
    by the Windows 8-bit charset for Arabic. You need to look for fonts that support
    \u2018extended Arabic\u2019 and target the entire Unicode basic Arabic block and
    extensions.\r\n\r\n<em>What would be the ideal typographic solution for Ajami?
    What style of script would be preferable based on these samples?</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    texts shown on the West African Islam website have been presumably written out
    by the scholars, so represent fairly characteristic but undistinguished handwriting.
    You see that the style is mostly quite flat, a descendant of the maghribi \u2018cursive
    kufic\u2019 style. In an <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/52785\">earlier thread</a>
    on the Arabic forum, I posted some images of sub-Saharan calligraphy, which are
    representative of the African style, commonly referred to as <em>ifriqi.</em>
    I like this style very much, but am not aware of any fonts that seek to represent
    it. [Titus Nemeth recently made a very nice revival of a metal maghribi type,
    but it is in a North African style which may or may not be appropriate for sub-Saharan
    languages.]"

    of Arabic fonts support only the Arabic, Persian (Farsi) and Urdu character sets,
    since these represent the minimum set defined by the Windows 8-bit charset for
    Arabic.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, that's what I was afraid of. But good to know that
    Adobe Arabic fonts support the whole Unicode Arabic block and extensions.\r\n\r\nAt
    the link in my second post, there is a [[table (PDF)]] of modified letters used
    in Wolofal, the Ajami script for Wolof (you will notice it's been assembled from
    several fonts). Several of the letters seem to be those already encoded in Unicode,
    like the ain with three dots above (U+06A0) that stands for /\u014B/. Others look
    like they should be encodable with combining marks, but I'm not sure how the very
    frequent three-dot combination is supposed to be encoded. Surely not by U+06DB,
    \"Arabic small high three dots\" found among the Koranic annotation signs section?\r\n\r\nThen
    again, scholarly interest in Ajami began only very recently, so letters needed
    for representing Ajami may still be being added to Unicode.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    reminding me of that sample of <em>ifriqi</em> calligraphy. It would certainly
    be great to have a font seeking to represent that style. But realistically, a
    standard Naskh font seems most likely to be used in a typographic transcription
    of Ajami. At this point, though, I don't think Ajami has been represented in type
    very often.\r\n\r\nIf I knew anything about Arabic typography and creating Arabic
    fonts, I think creating a font suitable for representing the various Ajami scripts
    would be an interesting and rewarding project to pursue."

  body: "I have only now discovered that the Unicode Technical Committee has accepted
    Arabic Pedagogical Symbols for inclusion in Unicode 6.0, which is scheduled for
    release later this year. Here are a couple of the proposal documents:\r\n\r\n[[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3460.pdf]]\r\n[[http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/wg2/docs/n3460-A.pdf]]\r\n\r\nThese
    would add the <em>Nuqta</em> (the dots to indicate phonetic modification) in various
    numbers and positions as combining characters to the basic shapes of Arabic, and
    at first glance would allow the encoding of all the modified letters used for
    Wolof Ajami shown in the [[http://ajami.wikispaces.com/file/view/Table+1+Modifications+of+the+Arabic+script.pdf|table]]
    (sorry, the link in my earlier post is wrong).\r\n\r\nThis seems a broader and
    more elegant solution than encoding each combination of basic shape and dots as
    pre-composed shapes. In fact, I was surprised it hadn't already been implemented,
    because I was searching for these combining symbols in vain in the current Unicode
    charts. Considering that extensions to the Arabic script have made use of such
    combinations for countless languages and dialects and that these orthographies
    have been ever changing, it is probably hopeless to document every single combination
    that ever occurred.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there are other combining symbols used for
    other Ajami variants that have yet to be documented and added to Unicode, but
    it seems likely that by the end of this year we should be able to represent at
    least the most prominent examples of Ajami in Unicode."

    way through ISO 10646 national balloting processes, and are expected to be added
    to one of the Arabic Presentation Form blocks. The final character names are different
    from those in the proposal documents, and they are being referred to as \u2018Arabic
    Symbol\u2019 characters.\r\n\r\nNote that these are <em>not</em> combining marks:
    they are spacing symbol characters for use in e.g. pedagogical materials about
    the Arabic script. They are expressly not to be used for generative purposes:
    Unicode's Arabic encoding model remains letter-centric, not archigraphemic, and
    there are no combining dots that can be encoded with dotless archigraphemes to
    produce new letters. One can argue, as I would, that an archigraphemic encoding
    would have been more elegant and flexible, but that is not the kind of encoding
    that Unicode inherited from earlier standards, and the inclusion of these nuqta
    symbol characters does not open the door to such an encoding. Trying to have both
    a letter and archigraphemic encoding would require new canonical decompositions
    for existing letter characters, which is contrary to stability agreements between
    Unicode and other standards."

  body: "I see. One of the proposals made it sound like these would be used like combining
    marks. So they are only going to be spacing, non-combining symbols, and as such
    won't be able to be used to form Ajami letters not otherwise encoded in Unicode.\r\n\r\nThis
    is rather disappointing. I see why Unicode tries to preserve compatibility with
    earlier standards, but in some cases I wish we could just start over from a clean
    slate.\r\n\r\nI suppose we couldn't allow archigraphemic encoding just for representing
    unencoded letters as long as it was prohibited to use them for composing already
    encoded letters? Yeah, I guess that would just complicate the encoding model for
    Arabic. And I suppose adding every possible combination of base letters and dots
    would be out of the question..."
