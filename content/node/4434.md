  two shapes are the same character rotated. Any clues? The closest similar I&#39;ve
  been able to locate is Dirk Uhlenbrock&#39;s <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=FOT0000071">Girl</a>.

  body: If it walks like a duck, and sounds like a duck... <BR> <BR>Actually, I think
    I found the character &#40;or at least a close facsimile thereof&#41; in Lineto&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.lineto.com/cont_cat_28.html">Dead Type</a> by Hansjakob Fehr.
    It&#39;s the third character from the right, one row up from the bottom. <BR>
    <BR>Whaddya think?

  body: I recalled seeing that face a long time ago on the Lineto site and loved the
    fact that it was constructed from shapes of hardware and such. The fact that Yves
    suggested a look at Lineto&#39;s stuff in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33999.html">my
    previous request</a> nailed it for me. Sure enough, it had that very gasket, or
    whatever the heck it is, in the display. <BR> <BR>Go figure.
