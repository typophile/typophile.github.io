  body: Dan, thanks for the list. I find it hard to believe that Linotype is in fact
    a &#34;common Hessian term&#34;, unless you&#39;ve added beer to your output.  <BR>
    <BR> <BR>Mmmm. Linotype Doppelbock. Auf ex!

    Actually though, beer is not the regional drink of Hessen, but rather wine &#40;and
    more specifically the apple wine that one drinks in Frankfurt&#41;. Doppelbach
    is a Bavarian variety of beer. Although good bavarian beers are easy to find here,
    I never see Doppelbachs.

  body: I had plenty of Doppelbock &#40;Becks, even&#41; when I lived in Bremen, so
    it has definitely spread beyond Bavaria. I did sample the Apfelwein in Frankfurt,
    but I&#39;m still a beer guy. &#40;Although my relatives in Baden are vintners,
    so go figure.&#41;

  body: Ach! I misspelled Doppelbock twice in my original post. A thousand lashes
    by a Franciscan monk for me... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a beer drinker, too. I almost never drink
    apple wine, I don&#39;t even really like it very much. If it is an acquired taste,
    then I don&#39;t want to spend the necessary time to acquire it, I guess. <BR>
    <BR>Although I drink more beer than wine, the whole of the wines produced from
    the Rheingau down through Baden are great. I prefer Baden wine to Rheingau wines,
    even though I live much closer to the Rheingau. The Rheingau vintners produce
    mostly wine wine, and it is too sweet, for my tastes. Even the bottles labeled
    &#34;dry&#34; are not what would be called &#34;dry&#34; in Baden. Baden red wine,
    produced in higher volumes that Rheingau red wine, I think, is also very good.
    <BR> <BR>What do kinds of wine do your relatives make? Where are your relatives
    located in Baden?

  body: Dan, they are in Oberbergen, on the Kaiserstuhl, northwest of Freiburg. The
    ancestral home is in Riegel, which is famous for its Pils &#40;at least in the
    region&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I honestly don&#39;t know what kind of wine they produce,
    since I tracked them down after I lived in Germany. I&#39;ve only spoken with
    them on the phone and via letter.
