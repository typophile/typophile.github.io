body: I really liked this for a while but maybe I've been working on it for too long
  'cause it's starting to bore me. The goal was to create something fresh and modern
  but I'm afraid I may be getting too quirky. It's a display face but I think it looks
  ok at smaller sizes. The spacing is a mess and it has no kerning at the moment.
  What do you think? Really give it to me honestly. I can take it, hehe. :)

    to know whether something is really worth doing. if i think it's really good and
    worth doing, i'll keep coming back to it till it's finished.\r\nI think you have
    some attractive forms in there - most of your lower case. The mix of angled and
    round joins isn't working for me. I think your best uppercase character is the
    K. If you can just capture what is going on there and extend it across the rest
    of your caps, i think this could be interesting. I've got some ideas of what this
    might be if you want to see them. i'm not a fan of the a or the s in the lowercase
    but most other things seem to be working for the most part. sorry to be so vague,
    but it feels like you're still trying to find a strong concept here. let me know
    if i'm off the mark."

  body: The angled/rounded joins was the quirky part that I also wasn't sure about.
    It was all part of my desperate attempt to make it seem unique, hee. I'd love
    to see any ideas you want to share.

  body: I for one would like to see it when it's done. I think it's got great potential.
    Love the "V" and the "L", not crazy about the "M" though. Guess I like all bends
    or all sharp corners, letters that have both don't work as well.

  body: " \"not crazy about the M\" - Termopolium\r\n\r\nThat's actually the letter
    that is my favorite, hee. The whole idea behind the font was the M that I sketched
    and the straight contrasting with the rounded joins so now I'm confused, eek.\r\n\r\nThe
    letters that I think could use some work are the N, Z and Z. They seem forced
    and a bit off. If I could find a good solution for those letters then I would
    be satisfied. I agree that the a and both the upper and lower case s need work."

  body: "I think I see a common problem in the M, N, and Z. in the rounded joins,
    the outside of of the joint is curved, but the inside is angled like \"<code>(&lt;</code>\".
    \  If it could be curved on both sides of the stroke, like on your V, \"<code>(c</code>\",
    except tighter, that could work, or at least be worth trying...\r\n\r\nMaybe that
    wouldn't work so well on the M. Eh... Try it and tell me if it works."

  body: I just realized that this font looks way too much like Ray Larabie's Cinecav!
    I'm just going to dump it.
