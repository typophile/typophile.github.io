  i use type. i've been paying much more attention to the subtleties of kerning and
  tracking and leading and gutters and all that good stuff. i've begun to notice the
  tiny differences between my favorite serifs and sans-serifs, and i've become very
  interested in reading up the history of this stuff.\r\n\r\nso... give me your favorite
  bookmarks, resources, whatever! i'd like to really understand how i use type as
  a designer. and these things only help more and more. the typowiki on this site
  is great, but sadly does not contain as much info as i was hoping :(\r\n\r\n<3!!"

  body: From what I gather, if you really want to get into it, you need to go to a
    convention centered around type & type geeks. I sense that this may affect your
    perception of reality, and from which there is no turning back. Whatever *other*
    advice you receive here will probably be from someone with a progressive case
    of the disease. In any case, it doesn't appear to be terminal in any sense other
    than the usual.

  body: "Hi, Gerald,\r\n\r\nHave you checked out the book list in the typowiki? Plenty
    of resources right there:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/wiki/Books\r\n\r\nOne book
    I don't see there is John Lewis' <em>Typography: Basic Principles</em>, which
    is out of print (1966, Studio Vista) but available used... It was also expanded
    and reissued as <em>Typography: Design and Practice</em> (1978, Taplinger), which
    you can also still find in used bookstores. It is like <em>The Thames and Hudson
    Manual of Typography</em> (1980, reprinted 1992) in that it was written BC, Before
    Computers. :-) But don't let that stop you from checking it out.\r\n\r\nAs for
    online resources on how to use type as a designer, I can recommend:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thinkingwithtype.com\r\n\r\nHope
    this proves useful.\r\n\r\n"

    from what I've read so far (the first two) these books are absolutely indispensable
    to the typographically conscious graphic designer. If you want to take your typography
    to the next level, read these. \r\n\r\nEven though you\u2019re not interested
    in designing type(?), I think it is necessary for the graphic designer to learn
    the basics of type design and hand lettering. Underware has a nice page on type
    design basics <a href=\"http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\"><strong>here</strong></a>
    and G Briem has a useful site on type and handwriting <a href=\"http://briem.ismennt.is/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.\r\n"

  body: "Good call, Geoff. I wanted to post links to Briem's and Underware's sites,
    but hesitated because Gerald expressed an interest in typesetting rather than
    typeface designing... But those sites offer very useful information it won't hurt
    a graphic designer to know... Briem's section on optical illusions is a good example
    of this.\r\n\r\nAnd Gerald, may I also recommend a couple of other books? \r\n\r\nOne
    is <em>Printing Types: An Introduction</em>, another book by Alexander Lawson
    (it is listed in the typowiki book page). The other is <em>A Short History of
    the Printed Word</em>, by Warren Chappell. There is a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0881791547/qid=1144890960/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-5164141-9033464?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\">second
    edition</a> that was expanded by Robert Bringhurst, too, although I am only familiar
    with the earlier version."
