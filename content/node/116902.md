  body: "<strong>Helvetica Neue Black</strong> is a very good substitute.\r\nThere
    is also a font called <strong>Olympia-ExtraBoldIta</strong> by B & P Graphics,
    Ltd (1993) which looks like a better match, but I can't find any legitimate source
    to acquire it and given the fact that B & P Graphics is a known font forgery company,
    I suppose this is just another Helvetica clone.\r\nSee the image bellow for a
    comparison... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olympia_5051.jpg]"

  body: "Good comparison Fivos. Helvetica would work fine if the tail was added to
    _a_ and the base of _t_ and top of _f_ was made more square. To my eye, noting
    else really needs adjusting to get a workable match.\r\nDon"

  body: "The name <strong>Olympia</strong> is used by B&P Graphics but most probably
    this is not the original font name (Unfortunately I haven't find any other font
    matching Olympia glyphs).\r\nB&P is a known font forgery company and according
    to some sources it has been sued by other foundries.\r\nYou can find more info
    on Luc Devroy site:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-45532.html\r\n\r\nFor all
    those reasons, maybe it's a better idea to use a modified Helvetica - Olympia
    is actually on a gray area regarding copyright and licensing.\r\n"

  body: "Agree 100% with Fivos. Particularly if this is a commercial use. Stick to
    known legitimate fonts and modify to the extent allowed. If you have questions
    as to what you can do in the way to editing the correct thing is to check with
    the font seller for additional permissions if needed. Not perfect, but better
    than a legal hassle.\r\nDon"

  body: "Back in the early 90's FontBank produced a collection of mostly very bold
    weight versions of many popular fonts. There was a font called Heroic Heavy (#158)
    which was an italic that seems to match this sample. Luc Devrouye's information
    about FontBank describes his belief that they were tweaked copies, but apparently
    the owner of FontBank was able to prove that his fonts were made from original
    artwork, even if they were not original designs. I think these fonts were widely
    available (and copied) at the time. Tiger Direct sold the FontBank collection
    (which I bought), and then they eventually renamed it as the Expresiv Classic
    Collection. \r\n\r\nMy point is that while we might not think much of these fonts
    as original creations they were widely sold in bargain collections, and people
    still have and use them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
