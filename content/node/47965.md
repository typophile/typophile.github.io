  body: Nope.. Significant differences.. It is similar to one of the neue versions
    of Helevetica.. but its different from those as well.

    and Univers don't come up as high as it does in Swiss."

  body: Not sure Rob. There's something wrong with the sample which make this almost
    impossible to work out. The first 'E' and 'S' in the word are wider than the pair
    at the end of the word. I also have my suspicions about the 'M' being slightly
    compressed. I have 2 very close matches in [[http://www.linotype.com/13263/neuehelvetica67mediumcondensed-font.html|Helvetica
    Medium Condensed]] and [[http://www.linotype.com/53772/linotypeunivers510compressedmedium-font.html|Univers
    Medium Compressed]] but I can't ID this for certain.

    match... Can''t be sure cause of it''s low quality. Amiart, where is this sample
    from? '

  body: 'I rule out Univers because the is ''R'' too square. I think Swiss is the
    closest so far and will probably be as close as we''ll get without clarification
    of the sample.  '

  body: The reason I ask for the source is that we're all speculating for nothing
    if it's from photocompositing days when there were many different Helvetica clones,
    all slightly different, most of which were undigitized.
