  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys, my name is Adam Jones, I'm a second year student and I'm working on a typeface design project for school. So this is the typeface I'm working on for school, currently these are all the letters I have finished in vectors and am moderately happy with. 

The sketch at the bottom is what I've based the lower case off of. 

Any criticism would be a appreciated. Be ruthless.

Yea, it has definitely moved away from what I wanted it to look like. I've started working on my sketches for the other letters and I've pretty much hit a wall with it. So I'm meeting with my prof tomorrow to discuss what I can do and get myself on the right track. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Body text –I suppose you think of printing purposes– has some usual guidelines you should go through, especially about metrics, strokes contrast and weight, counters, serifs and figure proportions.
I agree with you that the initial result has nothing to do with the original sketch –BTW, it seems more interesting, and it would be the most if it was even rougher.
One more thing: <strong>trust your eyes</strong> better than geometry and math measurements; they can find here and there where strength and weakness are; type design seems to be a matter of modelling and shaping –in the sense of sculpting– more than of building.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, very nice, salable typefaces. Kudos to them - that's no mean feat. But they are also very <em>safe</em> typefaces*, and not the way forward culturally. Something like Legato is.

* Except for Klimax - that's awesome.

The reason I dislike so-called "ductal logic" isn't because of anything emotional*; it stems from my understandings surrounding reading. They may be wrong, but at least I have some and I use them as a basis, instead of the other way around (if that).

* I can't say the same for GN.

Actually I do too (I once bought Ex Ponto to use on my wedding invitation). And I think that's a very human preference, and one that has a relevant place in display setting. But for text face design, I have to force myself to see the problem.
