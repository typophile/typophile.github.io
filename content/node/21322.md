  body: I think the smooth nature of the MacBook's underbelly is more conducive and
    conductive to egg frying than the keyboard - or maybe it just gets hotter.

    if you will. It takes the heat from the processor and exchanges it onto my hot
    little hands.\r\n\r\nDespite this, I love it. It is super quiet and ProTools runs
    fabulously well, waiting for the plug-ins to catch up. After trying to record
    with my MDD howling in the background, this is heaven\u2026\r\n\r\npeace\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I would just like to say that there seems to be a recent out break of hypocrisy
    around here. Just a few weeks ago, there was a thread posted about iTunes, and
    instantly there was comments that chastised the poster for making such a request
    for information on a \"type only\" forum. Personally, I don't mind the occasional
    off topic thread, but, I just wanted to point out that it seems it is okay for
    long time typophile members to post such threads, where it may not be okay for
    newer members.\r\n\r\nSii, this isn't anything personal."

    (once every five years) non-type related post, especially if it has good pun possibilities.
    If that's okay I'll post another one in 2011. If not, I apologize and won\u2019t
    do it again. Cheers, Si"
