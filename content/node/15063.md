  intake again!!! MY brain does not function without it!!!\r\nOff the wall note, several
  years ago at MacWorld, I snagged a font ID guide from Adobe that listed most of
  their stuff, has there ever been an update to that? A pdf download or some such?
  It's been mighty helpful for ID'ing fonts, but an accidental trashing of it has
  left me going nuts over fonts that I can no longer pick out..."
