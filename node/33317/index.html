<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am looking for a display face to use for a logo I am working on. The company name is Moustache and the market is 18-25 year old males. The source of their name is L.H.O.O.Q by Duchamp. They like the irreverence and wit of the piece and hope to do the same thing in fashion.
I know Duchamp is heavily associated with DaDa but because Punk referenced DaDa so heavily, when I reference DaDa I find myself referencing Punk inadvertently, which really isn't their bag. It's all a mighty tapestry... :)
Anyway, does anyone have any other ideas I might pursue? I don't mind doing some footwork on this. I suppose what I am looking for is typographic history. What else was going on in France at that time that he might be associated with?
Thanks for you help.

<div class=commentbody>Chocolate grinders, too. And ****ing a lot of women. Crossdressing (as Rrose Sélavy), optical effect devices, inventing readymades, graphic design (I'll get back to that), declaring painting dead, staying with friends and patrons (for years at a stretch), living of the same work for decades by producing official replicas, watching dust grow & being impossibly smart throughout all. You probably noticed: MD is my all time hero and fave.
Graphic design: MD did some remarkable work in this field, not dilettantish at all — he really dove into it. A very nice one is a cover he did for a box with fascimile in 1934: the titling was done with punched out holes. Couldn't find a pic of that online.
Other stuff, to give you an impression:

That's a cover for a chess book he did. And this is poster for a gallery:

In his high days Akzidenz Grotesk-like type was en vogue, as well as strangely ornate Nouveau-ish display type.
There used to be a font based on his handwriting available (from P22), but no more:

<div class=commentbody>P22 once had a font based on Duchamp's handwriting. (That font, as well as "Miro", were discontinued).

Also of interest is Yee-Haw's beautiful "DADA" poster for the National Gallery:

<div class=commentbody>A pity about the P22 font. That would have been a good option to explore.
Bert, by "strangely ornate Nouveau-ish display type" do you mean like Arnold Boecklin or Auriol? I am afraid those would be too feminine. And Akzidenz would be a bit dull for a logo, don't you think? Or perhaps I am just not a good enough designer to make it work. One doesn't want to blame unimaginative design on the typeface. That said, I can't think of a way to make Akzidenz a good wordmark for youth menswear.
Any other suggestions? And thank you for the link, Chris. I should have included that myself.

<div class=commentbody>Probably doesn't fit your market -- I try to shun those trying to persuade me to part with money -- but a font that strikes is Stone Sans.
If the more intellectual side of the coin is of any use, take a look at <cite>Manifesto: A Century of Isms</cite> edited by Mary Ann Caws, published by the University of Nebraska Press, and designed by Richard Eckersley. Text in Stone Print, chapter headings & Stone Sans, & I wish I could remember the display. In any case, the book covers that period rather well, but from a more literary point of view.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Always ok and evocative of the period is the lettering for the Paris Metro. There's a digital version called Metropolitan by Dover.

<div class=commentbody>i know this is quite late, but for others viewing these forums for reference, there is Dada Special Edition w/ OT, which i think is really fun and invokes the spirit of Dada and Duchamp nicely:
