body: Can anyone recommend a good place to start learning how to implement opentype
  features using fontlab 4.5? I&#39;ve copied and pasted code directly from adobe&#39;s
  syntax specification but it doesn&#39;t work for me. Is there a primer out there
  that is not entirely theoretical or completely technical, but just a quick and dirty
  guide to creating OT ligatures?

  body: The page referenced by Sergej seems to be about a different OpenType compiler
    &#40;not the Adobe/FontLab/FontMaster syntax&#41;. <BR> <BR>That being said, the
    general principles and feature tags remain the same.
