body: I am working on a project where web addresses split between two lines. What
  is the correct way to format for this? Hyphen or no hyphen? I'm sure this must have
  been discussed here. I apologize if I'm being redundant but a search using several
  related phrases hasn't turned up anything. Thanks!

  body: MLA styleguide, if I remember correctly, hold to no hyphen. The line would
    break at a forward slash or a dot (the dot would be carried to the next line).
    That is similar to the examples shown in the Chicago manual as well.

  body: "A better solution is often to use a URL shortening service such as TinyURL.
    That way all URLs are a consistent length, and the reader doesn't have to hand
    type a 67 character long address.\r\n\r\nNo hyphens required :)"

  body: "What Dan said. If the URL is so long that it's going to start wrapping, no
    one is going to want/be able to re-type that.\r\n\r\nDefinitely don't used dashes,
    though, as they are valid and common in URLs.\r\n\r\nAnother option if this is
    a regular publication is to simply cite all url references in the article:\r\n\r\n*
    = see page xx\r\n\r\nThen on page xx, list all the URLs and then provide a link
    to a page on the site with the same links:\r\n\r\nourbrand.com/links/2009/march/\r\n\r\nOr
    something like that.\r\n"

  body: I wouldn't trust URL shortening services. The book and that URL will last
    much longer than the tinyurl will last. URLs are ugly, but necessary. When I have
    to include a URL I generally will have a separate character style for them which
    is at least 2 points small and always at the end of the entry.

  body: "But that's the main difference between the web and print: I think the very
    nature of the medium means that people expect URLs to be temporary.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're looking at a 10 year old book, would you even bother typing in the URL
    to a referenced site? I certainly don't anymore. I have a bunch of web design
    books that reference old URLs that are all expired.\r\n\r\nI think the convenience
    of a URL shortening service far outweighs any legacy considerations."

  body: 'I want to agree with you, Dan. Really I do. But I would much sooner trust
    the entire URL to a tiny URL. True URLs disappear, long or shortened, but at least
    the reader of the book will have a base URL to begin the search should the entire
    URL go missing. '

  body: "If the goal is to get them to USE the url, shorter/fewer is better.\r\n\r\nIf
    the goal is to document the url, longer/more is better.\r\n\r\nIdeal world, you'd
    do both. Have the index page. List short urls and the full url. Also provide a
    single link to see the same set of urls online.\r\n"
