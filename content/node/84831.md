body: "Hello all! I'm a new member here, but have been impressed with the quality
  of the advice given here for some time now. I am sorry to barge in with a question,
  but hope you can forgive me and help me on my quest. Thanks!\r\n\r\nShort version:
  I'm looking for a typeface that says \"warm and cozy coffeehouse/pub\"\r\n\r\nNow,
  I have recently started working on a personal project (non-commercial) that can
  best be described a virtual coffeehouse or pub. An online hang-out, if you will.
  The place is called <em>Oldenburg's</em>, named after Ray Oldenburg, the professor
  behind the third place theory, stating that every person needs a neutral place other
  than home (first) and work (second) to socialize with his community.\r\n\r\nI have
  decided to [[http://www.oldenburgs.org/|blog]] every step of the way and have now
  officially entered the stage of identity design. I'm really, really torn between
  a pub-like Copperplate or a\u2014more personal\u2014script for the logo typeface.
  In any case, it should be timeless, as if it could've been around for decades already.\r\n\r\nMy
  question to the hive mind: what kind of logo typeface would you associate with a
  warm, cozy, homely \"third place\"? My [[http://www.oldenburgs.org/post/9171821801/did-a-moodboard-i-thought-my-palette-lacked|latest
  post]] has a moodboard that might inspire ideas. And I know it's subjective as hell
  ;)\r\n\r\nYour opinion is very much appreciated!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.oldenburgs.org/]]"

    add one.\r\nA <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/?refby=i\">Clarendon</a>
    / Slab Serif comes to my mind. One with some nice little imperfections, like <a

    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/belizio/?refby=i\">Belizio</a>
    etc (browse similar typefaces for more). I wouldn\u2019t go for a more wood-type-y,
    decorated font, nor for the obvious candidate these days, the condensed grot (<a

  body: "@kupfers Thank you! I was actually considering a Clarendon-esque typeface.
    Not in the last place because it was adopted by Starbucks some years ago (and
    must still be associated with it in the minds of some). I really like the cheerful,
    upright ear on Belizio's lowercase g!\r\n\r\nI also found [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/baskerville-2/baskerville-t-bold/|Baskerville
    Bold]] a nice fit, in part because of its open, \"smiling\" e, but perhaps a bit
    too generic."
