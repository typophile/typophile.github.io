  body: That is a tall order. I have too much work to do to track down these fonts
    in use, but you could try searching for them at Typophile and you might come up
    with ID requests that lead you to their usage.

    can use the test drives at MyFonts, or FontShop, for example. A couple of test
    drives of the same font can give you enough words for a sample sentence. Patty's
    idea seems likely only to give you isolated words in many cases too.\r\n\r\n -

    nice example of each in use (posters/book covers etc) like for example mrs eaves
    on emigre covers, or experimental jetset using helvetica... (those are ones i've
    found this afternoon...) any things that spring to mind on the list is what i

  body: "Hi Emily!\r\nYes, this request is way too broad, sorry. One or maybe two
    typefaces \u2013 okay. Everything else is really time-consuming. You could at
    least state what you have found yourself, so far, or what medium/period etc. you
    are focussing on. See also <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/45208\">this similar
    request</a>.\r\n\r\nAll I can do is give some general advice for finding typefaces
    in use:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/12344\">Search typophile.com</a>.
    Most of the faces you need have been asked for before. There\u2019s a <em>lot</em>
    to find.\r\n\r\nLinotype.com has a pretty neat <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2106/byalphabet.html\">in
    use section</a>.\r\n\r\nA lot of other foundries maintain such showcases aswell.\r\n\r\nEspecially
    if you\u2019re looking for images, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?ss=1&ct=6&w=all&q=palatino+font&m=text\">searching
    Flickr</a> (or similar services) has proven helpful, to me. You might try adding
    \u2018font\u2019 or \u2018type\u2019 to your query, when searching for short/ambiguous
    terms like \u2018Arnhem\u2019, \u2018Bell\u2019 or \u2018DIN\u2019.\r\n\r\nF"

    what a gorgeous magazine... wow'\r\n\r\nActually, Herb Lubalin designed a logo
    for the AvantGarde Magazine, and this became later the typeface. The original
    by Letraset for instance had very interesting alternatives, which were not easily
    available digitally until recently. At ITCfonts.com you can see them now in the
    AvantGarde Pro series. But when you look at (old Letraset catalogues and) the
    ElsnerFlake EF alternative designs, you will see a few very distinct letters (e,
    v, w, y) that did not make it to the Pro obviously.\r\n\r\nMany gorgeous headlines
    and logos resulted, and i am sure that you will find samples everywhere. Although
    it seems that AvantGarde is not extensively used recently."
