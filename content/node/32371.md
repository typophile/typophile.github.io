body: Hi, Can someone please help me identify this beautiful font? I love almost everything
  about it - the y's, the g's. It's wider than URW Grotesk. The a's are not Avenir's.
  Have searched everywhere. Custom? Thanks.

    a and monocle g, with the Alt weights of Ezzo:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MjYw&fontview=weights"

    however... Where did you find this specimen?\r\n"

  body: This is apparently half a menu from a hotel I believe. I found it at a friend's
    house with a phone number on the back - but it was ripped in half (with the top
    half missing!) so I have no idea where it's from. I've become obsessed with finding
    this face - can't seem to find anything exactly like it anywhere -- I've searched
    thousands of fonts -- so I'm assuming it's custom.

  body: "Well remy, I think it's time you set your so-called \"friend\" in a dark
    room with a bright light directed on them... and find out exactly WHERE they were
    when said ripped menu was given to them. Rhythmic water droplets on their forehead
    and bamboo under the fingernails are optional, I suppose.\r\n\r\nWhatever the
    case, the type is great... I will let you know if I make any discoveries!\r\n\r\n"

  body: It does resemble AG's Schoolbook a lot ... This type's uniform stroke thickness
    sets it apart, though.

    Doubtful, though, considering the headline \"Breakfast\" is a standard outline
    font.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "I just added some more text to my original link that I managed to salvage
    from this menu. The 'G' is what makes it different from AG or some of my other
    guesses. None of those 'fontfinder' thingies online are any help either. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    this font seems fairly compact height-wise. AG, etc. are taller... stumped! "

  body: Seems to be a consensus in my studio that this is the ever-elusive 'General'
    face. There's a thread on this site with a discussion around a face which looks
    pretty similar. The good ones are always unavailable :-)

    lowercase 'a'.

    the single storey 'a'? \r\n\r\n\"General had an alternate schoolbook form of \u2018a\u2019,
    accessed via the contextual alternates OpenType feature. (In retrospect, not the
    best choice, but at the time one of the only features one could trust.)\""
