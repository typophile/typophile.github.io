body: "Hi all. This is my first post here but I've been lurking for a while and trying
  to learn as much as I can. I'm fairly new to graphic design having only done it
  seriously for the last year. Due to the limited nature of our software at work I
  can only really practice and learn in my spare time, so I'm now trying to look for
  a job where I can actually develop and improve within the working environment.\r\n\r\nI'm
  a bit scared to post because it's my first go at something like this, but I'd really
  appreciate your critique and comments.\r\n\r\nI'll probably modify the top \"Personal
  profile\" section depending on the job.\r\n\r\nI'd be very grateful for any feedback
  whatsoever. I'm planning to send this off for a junior typesetting job on Monday,
  but I will try and revise anything that comes to light. Cheers."

  body: "Hi, James; welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nI think that you have a good start
    here with the two-column layout and the use of just one typeface, but I also think
    you need to adjust a few things...\r\n\r\nFor example, you are using many different
    sizes of type and leading... This is a bit distracting and doesn't lend visual
    unity to the piece -- quite the contrary. I would try to keep things simple and
    consistent. Choose one point size and keep the leading constant throughout. You
    can reduce the space between your job titles and their descriptions, as well as
    the leading in your personal profile, and apply that extra vertical space to do
    this. If you need to highlight something, you could use a second, bolder weight
    (for the section names, or for your job titles and university degree, to give
    two examples).\r\n\r\nYou could get rid of those tiny paragraph indents (they
    are barely visible) and add vertical space between the paragraphs instead. This
    will accomplish the same goal of indicating a new paragraph and be more in keeping
    with the overall design.\r\n\r\nYour job titles are followed by a big white space
    and the name of the employer; this is distracting. What if you simply separated
    the two items with a comma, avoiding that white space in the middle of those lines?\r\n\r\nYour
    contact info is the only block of text that is set ragged left; I would set it
    ragged right, like everything else on the page. And under \"Relevant modules...\"
    in the Education section, I would align the second bullet point in each line so
    that you have two ragged-right columns."

    description \u2018to\u2019. I am not so concerned about just one point size, however,
    I think you should restrict yourself to a maximum of three sizes, more important
    is the leading and inter-section spacing which should be consistent, less space
    between heading and body than body to heading. Your name is hanging a bit, my
    feeling is that it should align with the wide column or you could try aligning
    Barwell with that column.\r\nGood luck in your job hunt.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Thank you so much for all of the helpful comments. It's amazing how things
    stand out once they've been pointed out to you.\r\n\r\nWith the leading I was
    being a bit overambitious and trying to make the Profile copy stand out. I did
    bring the leading back into rhythm after that section, though I see that it's
    not working.\r\n\r\nI believe I've done all of the amendments that were suggested.
    I've changed the leading to 13pt to try and space the page out a little, and reduced
    the amount of font sizes (excluding my name) to 3, using 2 weights. I've also
    made slight adjustments to the copy because, for example with the bullets, certain
    things just weren't fitting in correctly.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.barwell.plus.com/misc/jb-cv-2007-Layout%204.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
    one thing I'm concerned about is the heading. I liked the way it broke up the
    page slightly, and thought it added some interest. I've done a few variations
    which can be viewed <a href=\"http://www.barwell.plus.com/misc/cvheader.gif\">here</a>.
    Personally I'm still inclined to use the 3rd one down rather than how it is set
    in the PDF, but I'd be grateful for any further insights into that and anything
    else about the new layout.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndie-graphics: thanks for your comments.
    I'm afraid my portfolio is rather underdeveloped at the moment. I'm trying to
    work on it every night and will have something ready should I get invited to interview,
    and I will certainly post it here once I'm a bit further along with it. I was
    working on a <a href=\"http://www.barwell.plus.com/design/guitar/guitar9.jpg\">vector
    guitar illustration</a> last month which is nearly finished, but that's about
    all I dare show for now!"

  body: "Much cleaner, the personal profile doesn\u2019t, to my mind, warrant being
    a different point size; in fact it contains the kind of information that should
    be in the accompanying letter (handwritten would be good if you are confident
    of your handwriting), however if you keep it turn over \u2018it\u2019, \u2018to\u2019
    and \u2018and\u2019, this will achieve two things, one improve the rag and two
    avoid the widow \u2018techniques\u2019, you might also turn \u2018and\u2019 over
    in the last paragraph of relevant experience. The space before personal profile
    might present a better appearance if consistent with the document. The phrase
    \u2018though I also do logo design when required\u2019 might be better worded,
    don\u2019t exaggerate beyond your capabilities (you might be found out) but it
    is a throwaway remark at the end of that sentence. For your name I like the vertical
    position in your current pdf (aligning to the ascender of the address) and the
    horizontal position of the third in your sample. One other thing I would remove
    the th after 7 in your d.o.b.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Nice work, James -- like Tim says, this looks much cleaner and inviting to
    read. I also agree with his remarks about improving the rag, what he says about
    not overstating your capabilities, and using careful wording.\r\n\r\nI would add
    that the bold weight you've chosen does not have enough contrast with the rest
    of the text -- I think that you should make it a bit bolder, so that it truly
    stands out. (You could try a couple of darker weights and compare the printed
    results with the current document.)\r\n\r\nAs for the header, I like the smaller
    size you're using for your name in the revised PDF... I second Tim's comments
    on the vertical and horizontal positioning... Now, what if you moved it left,
    back to the first column, and broke it into two lines? Then you could move \"Date
    of Birth\" and \"Driving licence\" up to the top. I would also line up the address
    column with the \"Final year project\" column. It's just an idea -- you're the
    final judge of whether this works or not, of course. :-)\r\n\r\nOne last tip:
    don't forget to kern your <strong>1</strong>'s...\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"

  body: "Thanks again both. I've done a further revision here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.barwell.plus.com/misc/jb-cv-2008-Layout%207.pdf\r\n\r\nI've
    printed and I think the new font weight (75) is looking much better. I tried moving
    the head around as per your suggestion Ricardo, which I thought was interesting
    but didn't fit in so well with the rest of the page, so I've moved it back to
    its original position for now. I've upped the weight of my name from 65 to 75
    to keep it consistent with the increased weight further down, but I'm still a
    bit undecided on it, particularly with the tails on the a's. I do think it works
    but I might play around with it a little more, perhaps even moving back to how
    it was in the last draft!\r\n\r\nWell observed comments regarding the logos, and
    I can see how it sounded a bit odd. Our head graphic designer normally does them
    but more recently he's thrown a few my way just because of his increasing workload.
    It's not really part of my job description but I did want to mention it, since
    I'm pleased with the work I've done. Hopefully the new sentence sounds a bit more
    reasonable and modest.\r\n\r\nI just hope everything else is in order and to the
    tastes of my potential employers!"

  body: "Wow, if you compare this latest version with the first one you posted, the
    improvement is outstanding! I like the current header but agree that this might
    not be the definitive version (not that there ever <em>is</em> a definitive version
    with resumes and portfolios, heh heh!) \r\n\r\nThese may or may not be tiny things,
    but:\r\n\r\n1a) I think you can lose the periods at the end of your referees'
    titles and addresses. First because they are not sentences, and second because
    you don't have periods in your own address or university degree.\r\n\r\n1b) Speaking
    of periods, I understand that in the UK it is common practice to not add a period
    after abbreviated titles such as \"Dr.\"... But I've never lived there, I just
    read it in a couple of books on typography. You probably know more about that!\r\n\r\n2)
    I'm not sure, but a few items look like they are letterspaced or tracked: your
    name, your telephone number, and Dr. Collins' phone number. Am I just imagining
    it? Maybe it is just the abundance of 1s and 7s."

  body: "Thanks I'll have a look into those before it goes off. You are quite right,
    I have increased the tracking on various numbers, which I think was something
    I read in Bringhurst's book in order to increase legibility. I did on my name
    as well just because it felt a bit dense on the page with that new weight. I suppose
    there's a bit of a trade off between consistency and legibility here, or perhaps
    I've just misunderstood that technique! I can't remember the chapter off hand
    but I'll try and double check that tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI was a bit skeptical at first
    and thought that my old one had some interesting elements which had been removed,
    but now that I look at them side by side the improvement is vast. It looks so
    much cleaner and inviting, I can't thank you guys enough for all the input and

  body: "Hmm... While the comments thus far have been primarily concerned with micro-issues
    (which are, of course, important), it seems that no one is mentioning that the
    Emperor is, well, naked. What I see is a certain competence with alignment, rather
    heavily aided by Ricardo and Tim's comments, but the issue, to my mind, is that
    the resume as a whole is lifeless.\r\n\r\nI see that you say your portfolio is
    <em>a little underdeveloped</em>, so without a pile of work to present you really
    need to make an impression with your resume; that is to say your resume has to
    be a solid <em>example</em> of your ability, and, to be really blunt, the current
    design ain't exemplifying a lot.\r\n\r\nI'm certainly not suggesting you over-design
    the thing, but the skill and talent you bring to and present in your resume design
    has to <em>prove</em> that you're a \"hard working, creative and motivated graphic
    designer\"; I would also stress that you need to place skill at the top of that
    list, and skill can only be <em>shown</em>, not spoken about.\r\n\r\nMy point
    is that what is there in the resume at the moment is a certain technical ability
    to arrange and space type, but there's no personality on the page. By personality
    I mean evidence of a solid education and relationship with type and design, from
    which your selections and decisions will speak volumes about you. That's the problem
    at the moment: the current resume tells me you're lacking in typographic and design
    experience, and whether or not that's true, the important thing is to not allow
    that impression to be made.\r\n\r\nGet your hands on some decent typography books
    and read them half a dozen times. I guarantee you that if you do so for even a
    week or two your resume will take on a whole different dimension of depth and
    balance."

  body: "Ricardo, you were absolutely correct about the periods. I checked Bringhurst
    and he says in the UK the general convention is to only use a period after the
    abbreviation if the word ends abruptly (so Doctor becomes Dr whereas Professor
    becomes Prof. with the period).\r\n\r\nThe bit about letterspacing the phone numbers
    also came from Bringhurst, but I've remembered only part of the detail and therefore
    got it wrong. Here's part of the section:\r\n\r\n2.1.6: \"Many typographers like
    to letterspace all strings of numbers as well. Spacing is essential for rapid
    reading of long, fundamentally meaningless strings, such as serial numbers, and
    it is helpful even for shorter strings such as phone numbers and dates. Numbers
    set in very short strings - triplets or pairs - need not be letterspaced.\"\r\n\r\nJason,
    thank you for your comments, and it pains me to admit that you are absolutely
    correct. As you can see from the resume I've never studied design or typography
    formally, and it shows more than I'd appreciated. It's too late for this job,
    but I will definitely be going back to the books and will have another go at this
    in a month or two. In the meantime I'm going to make the minor amendments and
    get my application sent out (it is a junior position with full training, doing
    company reports, so hopefully they will at least see my enthusiasm).\r\n\r\nOnce
    again thank you everyone for your time. Hopefully I can progress over the next
    few months and return with some better quality work."
