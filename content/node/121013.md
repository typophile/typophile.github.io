  designer. I've been trying to identify it by the g in the second word, and it appears
  as though it may be a variant of Trebuchet, but certainly not MS or 2010.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts appreciated!\r\n\r\nDarren[img:sites/default/files/old-images/neurolight_6209.jpg]"

    is faux\u2014it\u2019s an artificially slanted version of the roman, which is
    why the g isn\u2019t a match to the true italic version of Trebuchet.\r\n\r\nAt
    first, I thought that \u201CNeuro\u201D may be Brown by Lineto, but then I realized
    that it, too, was just a faux italic of Trebuchet Bold.\r\n\r\nYour first instincts
    were right, Darren. And the MS version of Trebuchet appears to be a good match."

  body: "You've nailed it - the first word is Treb bold, faux italic. The whole thing
    has been italicised afterwards.\r\n\r\nThank you! I made the silly mistake of
    not checking the standard 'g' first. Lessons learned!\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of
    this type of bastardisation, but I guess I'll be reproducing it on the final logo
    too!\r\n\r\nThanks again."

      \r\n\r\nThe angle appears to be -5.46 degrees to achieve this look (at least
      in Photoshop):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trebuchet_4816.jpg]"
