body: "Is it possible to use Python or Robofab to mark a set of glyphs ?\r\n\r\nI
  have a complex set of glyphs that I want to mark in a number of fonts to then alter.
  I know I could to it with a class but I would have to import the class into each
  font, but with a macro I could simple call it in each font that is opened.\r\n\r\nI
  was thinking something like :\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\r\nglyphsMark = ['A','C','D','K','1','3','/']\r\n\r\nglyphsMark.color
  = red\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nRr"
