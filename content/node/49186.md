  want to do is include the typefaces that are used. I expect that there will be many
  that I can't ID, so I am going to use this board as a resource. If this gets annoying,
  just ask me to cool it.\r\n\r\nMy first movie puzzler is Federico Fellini's 8 1/2.
  The title itself is probably custom but based on a typeface, and the credits are
  some type of Clarendon/Egyptian/*Italienne* that I can't find. Anyone know better?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8_1-2_TitlePic_6522.png]"

  body: I know it looks like it could be a typeface, but I think there is a good possibility
    that it was custom lettering. It doesn't look like any typeface that I know, plus
    the "D" and "I" are noticeably different in the smaller and larger sizes. Notice
    that the serifs are about the same size, even though the letters aren't. The two
    "F"s look different, too.

    other type in this title, in case that helps solidify the professional opinions."

  body: 'I''m still seeing slight differences in repeated letters, so I''m more convinced
    it''s lettering, not type. Judging by both samples now, I would say the lettering
    is based on Baskerville, but drawn wider and heavier. I wouldn''t have thought
    that would work, but it does. '
