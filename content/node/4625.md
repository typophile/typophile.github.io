body: Well, other characters as well...they don&#39;t show up on the screen in OS
  X applications when you use &#40;for example&#41; Postscript Type 1 fonts, yet when
  you change the font to a system font included with OS X, no problem. When they don&#39;t
  show up onscreen, there&#39;s a space there, but they do print fine. Weird. Anybody
  know anything?

  body: Many Type 1 fonts use the ISO-Adobe character set, which does not include
    14 math characters that are part of MacRoman. When combines with Adobe Standard
    Encoding, the system font driver substitutes the right glyphs from the &#34;Symbol&#34;
    font for both on screen and print usage. &#40;This can get more complicated with
    additional special flags and re-encoding vectors in the FOND resource, but the
    simplest case is overwhelmingly the most common one.&#41; <BR> <BR>Sounds like
    OS X broke this for on screen use, even though it still works in print. What exact
    version of OS X are you running? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I thought I had replied to this...guess not since it didn&#39;t show up. I&#39;m
    running OS X 10.3.3. I work for an Apple service provider/retail store in NC,
    and I have moved many of our clients to OS X...this problem with extended characters
    in Type 1 fonts not showing up onscreen is reproducible on every machine I try
    it on. What&#39;s funny is that I can&#39;t find anyone at Apple to bounce this
    off of, either.
