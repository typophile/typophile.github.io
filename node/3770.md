  <BR> <BR>Please critique this typeface. It&#39;s a sans serif family with four members.
  <BR>Thanks <BR>Rodrigo

  body: ' buenos. here&#39;s my two cents: <BR> <BR>-the uc &amp; lc &#34;c&#34; seem
    top heavy. same problem is there with the lc &#34;e&#34; as well. if you were
    to extend the bottom line this could be avoided. <BR> <BR>-one thing i don&#39;t
    understand is why does the stem in lc &#34;u&#34; and &#34;y&#34; slope, and it
    doesn&#39;t exist on any other stems. i suggest that you put a slant on the top
    of the leg on the lc &#34;k&#34; and add a slant to the end of the hairline in
    the lc &#34;x.&#34; <BR> <BR>-the uc &#34;W&#34; just doesn&#39;t do it for me,
    same thing with the lc &#34;w.&#34; the lc &#34;w&#34; looks like it&#39;s 2 v&#39;s
    put together. try to integrate them more. the uc &#34;W&#34; looks funny with
    the extended line in the middle. <BR> <BR>-the stroke of the uc &#34;M&#34; and
    &#34;N&#34; seems too thick compared to the rest of your uc. <BR> <BR>I love your
    letter forms. They&#39;re all very light and airy. It&#39;s going to look great
    with just a little bit of tweaking. I hope that my terminology was correct <IMG

  body: ' Much better, in fact, pretty good increase in attention to detail &#40;like
    in the numeral &#34;8&#34;&#41;. I think structurally you&#39;re almost finished,
    but there are still some issues of curve smoothness, alignment &#40;like probably
    make the curved leg of the &#34;n&#34; go lower&#41;, the spacing &#40;seems a
    bit irregular&#41; and I think it should have a little bit more stroke contrast.
    Maybe.  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp '
