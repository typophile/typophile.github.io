body: Hey guys &amp; gals, <BR>I&#39;ve got this logo and I know that all the letters
  have been customized with the tails &amp; points and stuff - but I was wondering
  if anybody knew a font that could be used to look similar &#40;after some customizing
  if needed&#41; It just looks like there&#39;s a &#34;base font&#34; here that the
  artist started with - any ideas? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.geocities.com/xdangerboy/devils.jpg"
