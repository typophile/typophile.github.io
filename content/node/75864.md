body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to locate a font called \"Information Bold Extended\"
  and \"Information Light Extended\". Apparently it was designed by FK Sallway in
  1958 for Klingspor and taken over by Stempel, and in Germany called Breite Fette
  Information.\r\n\r\nI've looked everywhere on the internet for it but can't find
  it.\r\n\r\nI wondered if anyone knows where I can get this typeface?\r\n\r\nAppreciate
  any assistance."
