  logo lockup. They are going international and looking to translate their name onto
  different languages (Hebrew included). I can't find an Hebrew version of FF DIN
  Pro (or any other DIN). Im facing with the decision of finding an alternate typeface
  that could accommodate my needs. Please send help!"

    by Din. (but was not designed to be a Hebrew Din version). I'll let you be the
    judge about the match\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/din_5261.png]\r\n
    and you can try the font at my site: [[http://hafontia.com|hafontia.com]]\r\n\r\nCheers
