    The fonts are 2 of my own designs. The text is in \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16147\">Now
    Sans Light</a>\" and the bold is a new design I just started called \"Lozenge\".
    \ Lozenge is actually half of an ego/alter-ego pair of fonts that are very similar
    but one is wonkier and one is more normal--kind of a leftbrain rightbrain thing.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
