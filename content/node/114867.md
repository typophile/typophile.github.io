  body: To me, that's two custom jobs, top one on Avant-Garde Gothic and bottom one

  body: "The top is 99% solved, I'd really like to have the capital A's bar on the
    bottom. Any fonts with that feature that's similar to Avant-Garde Gothic?\r\n\r\nThe
    bottom is spot on!"

  body: 'Sorry, don''t know any Avant-Garde with such a treatment but that''s actually
    not a problem as it''s not difficult to reproduce: separate /R leg from counter,
    /E crossbar from vertical stem, remove /A crossbar and reuse it at the bottom.'
