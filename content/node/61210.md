    \r\n\r\n2.2. Embedding. You may embed the Font Software in documents, applications
    or devices either as a rasterized representation of the Font Software (e. g.,
    a GIF or JPEG) or as a subset of the Font Software as long as the document, application
    or device is distributed in a secure format that permits only the viewing and
    printing but not the editing of the text. You need an additional licence from
    FSI or its Distributors (i) for the use of the Font Software in documents, applications
    or devices permitting editing of the text, if such documents, applications or
    devices shall be distributed to third parties or (ii) if the Font Software is
    embedded neither as a subset nor as a rasterized representation.\r\n\r\nAlso a
    knock-off of FF DIN is kind of like saying a knock off of Courier New. The underlying
    design is derived from public domain model, no? \r\n"

    2.2 of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/help/licenses/fontfont/\">FF\u2019s EULA</a>
    requires a <strong>subsetted font</strong> used in a <strong>secure format</strong>
    for permitted <strong>non-editable embedding</strong>. As Sii already mentioned,
    no format is absolutely secure, but as a foundry you have to define your understanding
    of security. So \u2018secure\u2019 means here: encrypted which may be related
    to the font file and/or the document containing the embedded font file. Formats
    with encryption/protection of the whole document are allowed as the fonts are
    protected within the document. Flash is such a format. "

    re-read the license before posting. My apologies for the fuss. Thanks, guys.

  body: "Thanks Ivo,\r\n\r\nIt would seem that with a single user license one could
    ship a subsetted version of a FF font with say an XBox game (considered secure)
    to display UI elements, dialogs etc., providing it's not used in input fields.
    Does that sound right? \r\n\r\nAlthough app and device friendly - the editable/print
    preview distinction is still a little document-centric.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps in a
    device/app world it's better to talk about static vs dynamic content, rather than
    editable/print-preview. \r\n\r\nHaving said that I really like my interpretation
    of the EULA and if that matches your intentions I'll be pointing our game and
    device developers over to the FF library immediately. :-) \r\n"
