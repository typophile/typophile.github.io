  body: "I think its likely a font, but one with lots of ligatures and alternates.
    The wh ligs and ending w's appear the same, but at that size I can't be certain.
    \r\n\r\nThat thing with the y's is pretty atrocious. I always find it amazing
    how something like that can run through whole committees and get unnoticed. I've
    seen this same behavior when copying type from Freehand to Photoshop. Sometimes
    descenders run too far below the descender boundary and just get clipped. Turning
    the type to outlines before copying will prevent that."
