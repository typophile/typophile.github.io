  body: "Hi LimCynthia!\r\n\r\nI found your goal very interesting, yet highly challenging.
    It\u2019s not so terribly hard to design a display typeface, but it\u2019s much
    harder to design a legible sans serif typeface (and even harder to design a great
    and legible book typeface). Your aim is really hard \u2013 you need to design
    a typeface, which is highly and comfortably legible yet still elegant (while there
    is definately need of esthetic education for low vision children as well). That\u2019s
    right on the crossing between art and true science.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can guess
    from your sketches, you are propably an autodidact. That doesn\u2019t mean you
    can\u2019t manage it but that does mean that it will be very hard and long-term
    work :) If you are more interested in the science part of this project more than
    on the art side, I would suggest you to build a cooperation with some experienced
    typographer (while this project seems to be really challenging). If I am totally
    wrong, please accept my sincere apologies.\r\n\r\nNevertheless \u2013 if you\u2019ll
    decide to work on this project by yourself, I would sugest you to design an easier
    typeface first just to get familiar with basic principles of building letters
    \u2013 it sounds horrible but I really don\u2019t want to discourage you! :)\r\n\r\nSome
    research in highway signs typefaces would be also very helpful while they\u2019re
    dealing with similar problems (e.g. http://www.peterbilak.com/content_items/euroface.html
    ).\r\n\r\nAs you\u2019ve written on your blog, there are few rules you want to
    follow. To be honest, I\u2019m really not sure that all of them are compatible
    with your goal. Especially fixed widht and fixed height \u2013  as far as I know,
    different heights and weights of letters help us to recognize and distinguish
    different letters. You should propably more concentrate on minimal weight of the
    strokes and space between them as well so they will not coalesce into a single
    shape. All essential elements of letters must be shaped exaggeratedly so low vision
    children will be able to read them.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least \u2013 try to
    sketch by your hand first :) I would suggest you a thick black marker. This tool
    will help you to recognize essential shape of each letter and not to bother with
    unimportant details.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
