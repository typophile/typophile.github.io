  body: "What Hrant is referring to is a calligrapher, someone who uses a pen to produce
    fine quality documents.\r\n\r\nThe term letterer usually refers to someone who
    fills in the word balloons in a comic.\r\n\r\nUnlike Hrant, though, I was not
    sure from your original post that you were, in fact, looking for a calligrapher.
    I thought that it was also possible you were looking for a typographer who used
    script typefaces to create an effect similar to calligraphy."

    \u2013but not fonts\u2013 in any way; could be a logo, could be window signage...
    And I wasn't sure (and still am not :-) that P_P is looking for a calligrapher.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Letterers draw letters (in the context of a specific piece of text).\r\n\r\nType
    designers draw letters (to be reproduced in many texts)."
