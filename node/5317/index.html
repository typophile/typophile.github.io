		<div class="commentbody">Frank, <BR>I am afraid I cannot agree with you. <BR> <BR>Backward compatibility in apps like IND is waste of time for developers. It can never be 100% reliable because there are new objects in newer version which have no counter-part in the older versions. <BR> <BR>If one does not use &#34;new&#34; features, he/she does not even need a &#34;new&#34; version. And in the situation when one uses nested styles or mixed spot inks, there is no way back. I do not mention text re-flow due to composition algorithms are different. <BR>Just look at the legacy export from AI CS. Once you save the file in AI8 or older, the text objects are converted to outlines, transparency flattened and so on. You cannot definitely edit such file. So, what is the point? What are the reasons for backward compatibility?  <BR> <BR> <BR>As far as I know users demand this feature just because they have a bad habit of exchanging advertisements in the open formats like QXD or INDD. But in the era of PDF/X it is just a silly and dangerous anachronism. <BR> <BR>I wish Adobe developers spend their time on the IND fine-tuning, for instance, instead of backward compatibility. And definitely I do not want to pay it in the upgrade fee. There are still more useful features to come. <BR> <BR>Or am I missing something? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Pavel</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Quark had many years of market dominance and, after the first 3 revs, took a zillion years between versions.  Backwards compatibility was a major issue with that many legacy files out there.  When they finally did a REAL rewrite after a long hietus, they screwed it up so badly that you wondered if they knew what alpha and beta testing was for.  Adobe, on the other hand, just had its toe in the market with InD until recently. There couldn&#39;t have been that many legacy InD files to worry about.  The other comparison is stability.  Many Quark users &#40;me included&#41; clung to 4.11 because everything after that was a game of Russian roulette &#40;flow five pages then blow your brains out&#41;.  With InD &#40;in my very small survey of InD users&#41; CS is by far more reliable and sensible than 2.0.  It is a no-brainer upgrade.  Quark 5 &amp; 6 should have been no brainers for me too as in: DON&#39;T DO IT!!! Even so, I stupedly bought them and paid the price in headaches. <BR>I believe Thomas when he says Adobe tried to make CS backward compatable.  It is better to leave out a bad feature than to make a mess out of everyones files.  At this point, I don&#39;t feel the small number of 2.0 files in the world are worth the effort to put money into a rebuild of CS.  After a couple of years, when Quark is dead and buried and Adobe has the massive market share, you can make a strong case for Adobe making the next rev capable of opening CS files. IMHO. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, Let me explain something here. I bought IND 2.0 just 9 months ago. It wasn&#39;t cheap since it was a Dutch version. Now my co-worker needed a new computer so I bought a G4 and the complete CS package. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s obvious, istn&#39;t it? To be able to exchange documents I need another CS upgrade. But it&#39;s not only me. Also every freelancer, and every lithographer I work with is forced to invest. Again! <BR> <BR>I know that backward compatibility had its limitations with transparancy and such, but at least you had a choice. Partial compatibility would have been fine, just to get around during these first phases of designing. I&#39;m sure you know what I mean. If it wouldn&#39;t have been for the famous MarkzTools we would have burned down Quark long ago for not supporting backward compatibility.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If this was an isolated incident I&#39;d believe Adobe&#39;s PR line, their implementation of backwards compatibility was not ready for prime-time. As a designer, and many others may agree with me, if you have ever had to open an old file or work with a vendor that used an old application &#40;even if the file is in &#34;editable splinters&#34;&#41; it&#39;s an important feature. It better than scanning and starting from scratch. In many ways this detail in software marks the difference between Adobe and say, other boutique software developers. This is what you pay for when you buy a professional software program at a premium price.</div>

Microsoft can eliminate backwards compatibility with some software to manipulate buyers towards their future plans because they are the only game in many areas. After reading this artcle I am reminded that Adobe has develped some agressive attitudes towards Apple in the past few years.  <BR> <BR>When Apple was makeing the shift from 68 processor to the PowerPC there was a lot of heads up warning. There was a public &#40;mac public&#41; understanding of why this was good and what to expect. Same for OS X. Even Microsoft seems to be upfront in some ways as the article points out that the push for MS Longhorn may be unhappy change fro many users.

Is there any doubt about the significance of Adobe&#39;s products for Apple&#39;s success? The rest of the computing world is happy to denounce developing for Apple because of the minor significance of Apple&#39;s 2.5% market share. However, Adobe had not always sided with Apple.  <BR> <BR>Is there an institutional aggression towards Apple from Adobe? I have no evidence. What I can say is that Apple users feel a pinch whenever software companies want to talk about eliminating support for Apple. All during the OS X introduction there were many discussions questioning Adobe&#39;s commitment to Apple. <BR> <BR>I was surprised to hear that <a href="http://www.macworld.com/2001/05/bc/04atm/">Adobe would not support Type Manager</a>. I&#39;m sure many feel that there are plenty of reasons that Adobe would be justified in leaving Apple on font management. Apple is making inroads with certain products that would infringe on Adobe&#39;s monopoly. So Adobe&#39;s response is to drop the product? <BR> <BR>Why is there no room to have competing applications? Is any less of 2.5% not enough? <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is just my opinion, of course, and does not represent any official view of my employer. I&#39;m neither on nor particularly close to the Premiere team. <BR> <BR>Any time an OS vendor comes out with an application &#40;including buying a pre-existing one&#41;, it tends to do very well against the competition in terms of market share, though not necessarily in profitability. Outside of games, this has historically been true for both Apple and Microsoft. Though there have been exceptions, of course. But the marketplace is littered with products that competed against the OS vendors and died off. <BR> <BR>Adobe has in a few cases chosen not to develop products on the Mac. In almost all those cases there were competing products available, including ones from Apple It&#39;s just a business decision. But it&#39;s not &#34;aggression&#34; against Apple--quite the contrary; Adobe&#39;s dropping Premiere development on the Mac doubtless &#42;helps&#42; Final Cut Pro. <BR> <BR>And of course Adobe does not have a monopoly in any of the application areas under discussion. Certainly not in font management, where there have been viable competitors all along &#40;e.g. Suitcase, Font Reserve, and now FontAgent Pro&#41;. <BR> <BR>In the particular area of Mac font management, I do know a fair bit about the business. I agree with something that one of the top people at one of the other companies said to me once, which was that there had been room for two products to be moderately profitable, and that with Apple bringing out FontBook, there was now only room for one retail offering. Not that there couldn&#39;t be more, but no more than one of them could make money. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the dropping of ATM Deluxe with OSX, I have to say I reluctantly went with Font Agent Pro &#40;and only because Stewf touted it so highly&#41;. Though Insider, as a small company, has been fairly responsive to my questions and complaints &#40;it was only at 2.1 that FAP became capable of managing fonts in Classic, and it still doesn&#39;t display dingbat fonts correctly&#41;, it doesn&#39;t do one major thing that ATM Deluxe did so well, thanks to Adobe Type Reunion, that is, family grouping, especially in Classic apps. I actually waited for 10.3 to switch because of the promise of FontBook, but the reports of its uselessness were so wide and loud that I simply decided to go the FAP route. Bottom line is, I&#39;m sorry Adobe decided to take a pass on OSX with ATM Deluxe -- the way I see it, if there&#39;s one company who could have done it completely right &#40;and likely have been profitable in the process&#41;, it&#39;s Adobe. Would have gotten my money, that&#39;s for sure.</div>
