  the century R. Hoe cast iron press approx. 22 by 29 platen with a rack and pinion
  instead of a rounce ,  and the platen has been thickened for rigidity making it
  quite strong and reliable. The Cincinnati pres I worked on, in the attachment, an
  earlier model had a thin platen with large fin braces could still print a large
  folio the size of a sheet of Roma handmade laid. \r\nAlso attached are some cases
  of hand type from the bank, galleys, and a form.\r\nThe sideways galley has Ludlow
  lines in it. I'll correct it at some point.\r\nPlease note; you can control click
  on large images to open in a new widow if need be. "
