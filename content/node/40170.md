  to Big Caslon? Right now I\u2019m doing a lot of work with ITC New Baskerville,
  and once I get past text sizes the hairlines blow up and it starts to look really
  horsey. Sometimes I can make it work by playing games with color, but I would rather
  just have a display face."

    a lot of weights, mind you. :)"

  body: "ITC New Baskerville don't work well either in big (too fat) or small size
    (too fuzzy-light), only between. Pfuff, sad because its a really good typeface.\r\n\r\nFry
    Baskerville despite a very nice typeface is actually not really \"a\" Baskerville,
    similar story as with Garamond Jannon to be short?\r\n\r\nHenderson should be
    probably a good idea, but sadly not available: http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/HendersonSerif\r\n\r\nTry
    Storm Type? Perhaps good for display versions?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-22-baskerville-original\r\n\r\n"
