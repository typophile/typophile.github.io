  body: I think it is a grunged up version of Helix, Yves--at least the lowercase.
    The uppercase and numerals look like a grunged-up version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/arial/rounded-mt-bold/testdrive.html?s=DENVER+5280+FT&amp;p=48">Arial
    Rounded</a>, or maybe even just plain old Arial.
