  sports oriented and with a slightly updated feel as opposed to typical slab serifs
  like Rockwell.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCurtis"

  body: "Thanks, I looked at House Gothic but it seems a little too retro and closes
    up too much in the boldest examples-- nice though for sure.\r\n\r\nCavalier looks
    cool though-- thanks to both."
