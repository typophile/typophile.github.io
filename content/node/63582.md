  body: "I'm looking at Dafont now and I notice a font that could be used as a starting
    point to 'tweak' into this style. See [[http://www.dafont.com/tes.font?nb_ppp=50&text=WHEN+PLANETS+EXPLODE|Tes]],
    and flip the M to become the W. Convert the letters to outlines and start moving
    some points around to change the new W width, the E and H crossbar height and
    the endpoint of the N diagonal. The shapes of the other letters look almost dead
    on to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
