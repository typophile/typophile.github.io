  but to no avail) - I would love to hear comments, advice, etc. about websites that
  blatantly post your font for others to download them for free. And then to insult
  to injury, request that you jump through ridiculous hoops to get them removed. How
  much time do you all spend pursuing this, what's your take on it, approach, etcetera?\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "If you find a site with Mediafile/Rapishare links, don't even bother contacting
    the owner of the site. They'll just tell you that they don't host fonts, you'll
    waste a lot of time and get nowhere. Do to where the files are hosted. You can
    take Mediafire links down pretty quickly. You have to write up a list of fonts
    along with your address, phone number and some DMCA required rigmarole. But once
    you've done it, you can quickly target and shut down subsequent Mediafire & Rapidshare
    links by sending the same info. I've done it a few times. People can re-upload
    the files but if you really want to shoot a link down, you can.\r\n\r\nIf you
    find a site that appears to be offering your fonts through Usenet, just ignore
    it. The casual downloader won't bother with those anyway. A lot of those sites
    create fake lists of files based on search inquiries. If you search for nude photos
    of Nick Shinn, they will later claim that they have nude photos of Nick Shinn
    which you have to pay to access. That's what I heard anyway . . . from this guy
    I know. Yeah.\r\n\r\nIf you find a site that's offering your fonts for direct
    download, send a polite email first, that's always done the trick for me. I've
    always found free fonts site operators to be reasonable. They're either reasonable
    or absent. There were three cases where the site owners didn't bother to leave
    a contact link. I contacted the ISP, they gave they guy a few days to respond,
    they didn't and the whole site was shut down. To my knowledge, none of those sites
    ever returned. Ba-boom!"

  body: "I'm a largely retired lawyer with an interest in typography. I've never been
    a designer.\r\n\r\nI understand the annoyance of seeing one's work used without
    consent and without compensation and I sympathize. Nonetheless, the pirating of
    fonts likely does not lead to significant loss of revenue to the designers and
    foundries.\r\n\r\nUnconsented use falls into 3 general categories:\r\n\r\n1. Use
    within the Fair Use Doctrine, which allows use of copyrighted material under certain
    conditions, e.g., for educational purposes, criticism, etc. Downloading by font
    collectors who do not actually use the fonts for print materials, websites, etc.,
    likely fall into this category.\r\n\r\n2. Improper use by high-end designers and
    design studios who are being compensated for their work. These people certainly
    should be paying for fonts and their improper use of fonts and other intellectual
    property does represent a loss of revenue to the creator of the font or other
    intellectual property. I am not privy to the data, but from what I've heard most
    such designers properly license material they use and charge the cost to the customer.
    If so, this group does not represent significant losses to the designers of the
    work they incorporate into their designs.\r\n\r\n3. Improper use by low-end designers.
    This use is clearly improper, but also likely does not represent a significant
    loss of revenue. If one is designing a flyer for a local business, e.g., Sam's
    Car Wash, Sam doesn't know much about fonts and doesn't care what font is used
    so long as someone can read the flyer with the $1 off regular price coupon. If
    the designer chooses to use a font that he or she has not licensed, the use is
    likely personal whim.  Not being able to pass the cost along to the customer,
    the designer is unlikely to pay for fonts for which he or she does not hold a
    license. Instead, if the designer was unable to use the unlicensed font, he or
    she would simply use a font to which he or she had a license through purchase
    of the computer's operating system, Adobe Creative Suite, etc.\r\n\r\nSo. . .
    . Take pride in the beautiful work you've created, enjoy what revenues you do
    receive, and write letters to websites hosting illegal downloads asking them to
    remove the offending fonts. Don't waste money on hiring lawyers, though, because
    you are very unlikely to recover the cost of having a lawyer write a letter for
    you, let alone file a lawsuit for you, particularly when the hosting site is hosted
    outside your own country.\r\n\r\nFinally, Laura, I've seen some of your fonts
    -- though I've never used one since courts would not welcome calligraphic script
    fonts in legal documents -- and I think your work is beautiful. Were I a designer
    of items for which your fonts are suitable, I would surely license and use them."
