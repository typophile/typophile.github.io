    <BR> <BR>Generally, less formal or less &#34;industry&#34; oriented than AtypI.
    Definilty not a replacement for AtypI, but a good way to have a weekend of total
    type-geek immersion &#40;I mean that in a good way&#41;. I have been trying to
    recall Peter Bain&#39;s exact phrasing when describing the various type conferences
    and organizations, but it was something to the effect of &#34;TypeCon is where
    the type hits the street&#34;. There are at least as many type &#34;aficionados&#34;  as
    type designers at these events. Without sounding too much like a sales pitch:  if
    you love typography, you must go. <BR> <BR>I leave you with some <a href="http://p22.com/photoalbum/typecon/typecon2003pics/index.html"

    has Ross-like qualities, so I would have made the same guess. However the profile
    in the mirror is distinctly un-Ross like. Perhaps you could post a full size cropped
    detail of the mirror so we can correctly identify the victim. It would be the
    right thing to do. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

    this year, and the selection process was difficult! <BR> <BR>Max just worked on
    the great pro bono project,  Building Letters, and we are so pleased that he will
    donate more of his time to help make TypeCon a success. <BR> <BR>Max is hard at
    work on the identity right now, and we&#39;ll unveil the new look after the holidays.
    Thanks to Max, and to everyone who participated in the review process. SOTA and
    TypeCon could not survive without the help of people who give their time, creativity,
    and financial support! <BR>
