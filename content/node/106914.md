  in a paragraph of small caps. E.g. in a paragraph:\r\n\"THE SMALL DESCENDER ADJUSTED..\"
  - I want to extend the bottom of the \"J\" to about 20% below the baseline.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas how? Or what this type of lettering would be called?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "You will need a font that has this kind of small cap j and select that glyph,
    either manually in the glyph palette or via some OT feature. If the font doesn\u2019t
    have a descending small cap j, you can always ask the type designer/foundry to
    modify the font. \r\n\r\n"

  body: The best idea, of course, is to get a font that has the character you want.
    But in a pinch you can always convert the type to outlines and manually pull down
    the bottom of the character. You will probably have to modify the terminal to
    get it to look right.

  body: If you're using a page layout program like InDesign, you could also select
    the J and modify the vertical scale of the character to make it taller, then adjust
    the baseline shift to move it down. But you end up with a distorted letter, so
    it's not the best solution.

  body: "Caslon - and Imprint, derived from Caslon - have this characteristic, and
    no doubt many other oldstyle typefaces do as well. Ah, yes: Garamond, Bembo, and
    even Baskerville do this.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Bembo, in my search, I came across
    [[http://ilovetypography.com/2008/01/22/why-bembo-sucks/|this article]] which
    turned out not to be a criticism of Bembo itself <em>per se</em>, but about the
    fact that the digital versions of Bembo and many other typefaces don't come in
    modified versions for different point sizes."

  body: "My personal belief is you can't be a typesetter without owning, and being
    able to use, just a bit, a font editing program. That solves your problem.\r\n\r\nIt
    also solves your problem when you need an accented character the font publisher
    ignored (fairly common), because they almost universally forget to include the
    combining diacriticals, which is the way Unicode wants you to make up such characters.\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nYou
    do need to pick typefaces where the EULA allows modification. But you should anyway.
    Any font purchased under the Adobe license before 2011. Probably any Adobe Original,
    of any year. A number of fonts from some of the smaller foundries.\r\n\r\nA number
    of letterform-modifying tools are now incorporated in layout programs, but not
    ones to add characters in Unicode, and no real good ones to modify character shape
    as you want in this example. You could do as James suggests, and paste a bit of
    white over the now-too-thick top serif, but the bottom terminal of the J will
    still be distorted, with no fix in sight.\r\n\r\nI guess if I had to set one using
    only InDesign, and if the *file* were not important, I might set two J's & fuss
    things into shape. There is usually a way to get something to work, as long as
    you don't care about the eventual file. And I'm cheap, only $60/hour, but there
    is a minimum.  This is not the way to go. It is literally less than 10 minutes
    work with a font editing program."
