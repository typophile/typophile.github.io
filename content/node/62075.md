    like the sample. However, they both look a lot like each other, and I can still
    see differences with Stephen's sample. (So there's hope for me, I guess.)\r\n\r\n-

    The closeup shows better how similar those slab serifs are; the one on the chin
    of the G looks like it wasn't centered properly. If you can match the e and the
    other counter shapes, you've got the starting point, if this theory is right.\r\n\r\n-

    it was an 'adaptation' of something existing already. Certainly adding serifs

    enough 'Trebuchet MS' fits fairly well as a base for adding the slabs. Might dig
    into the PDF tonight for a look at the outlines.
