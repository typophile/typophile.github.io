  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have been very interested in typography for a long time, and have only recently decided to start working towards actually completing a font. These are two projects I&rsquo;m working on right now. They are both unicase (I really like unicase fonts) - other than that, I think they pretty much speak for themselves. The first one may be a bit ambitious, but hey, let me know what you think! Even if you think it isn&rsquo;t very good. I just want some perspective.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>very very interesting, but dont you think you should show us a little bit more?
:)</p>
<p>the first one looks kind of strange, i suppose those &ldquo;outgrowts&rdquo; should be some kind of &ldquo;ink traps&rdquo;?
i doubt that will look good in small sizes. maybe some optimazing would do it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting you&rsquo;re working on two so much contrasting fonts. Well both are rather bold.</p>
<p>Very nice. The black letter based unicase looks very very nice display font. /S/ is unbalanced thought. And lots is still missing. But is a great start. The way you&rsquo;ve designed /a/ is rather unique and beautiful.</p>
<p>Candy on the other hand is not so unique. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. It&rsquo;s just as well nice, but not as special as the unicase Beast.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I must say I really like them both, but I love Beast. I&rsquo;m super interested to see it finished. The little &ldquo;outgrowths,&rdquo; as you&rsquo;re calling them, are great. Adds a lot of flavor to the face. The /a/ in particular is a beautiful little nugget. 
Candy is also really nice. It seems to flow well, but of course I&rsquo;d have to see a lot more of it to gauge that accurately. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of the heavier style of font, and these are right up my alley. Really nice work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here are some sketches of the first one. It&rsquo;s still in very early stages, and I am just sort of having fun with it. and those &ldquo;outgrowths&rdquo; you are talking about are really more like serifs - it&rsquo;s really experimental and it&rsquo;s sort my attempt to bring together the humanist aspects of blackletter and oldstyle.</p>
