body: "This design started out from imagining that the dotless <em>\u0131</em> was
  the basic <em>i</em>, and the dots on <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> were diacritics.
  I was traveling in Turkey and Hungary at the time, and the other diacritics flowed
  naturally.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think, good or bad. I'm also looking
  for a name, if anyone has any suggestions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xenonsequitor-sample-590.png]"

  body: I love the name and how the accents work! It seems awfully dark though. I
    can't see typesetting a book with this (at least not as it is now). Also the UC
    "U" seems confused - I like the idea but the eye just goes straight to the right
    top edge and wonders why it doesn't "feel" (if not look) symmetrical. I think
    this happens for other letters as well. So I would suggest thinking of how to
    balance them a bit more while retaining the "idea". Just some thoughts.

  body: "New version uploaded with kerning by [[FontForge]]'s auto-kerning, which
    is actually pretty good. \r\n\r\n@bemerx25: Thanks for the comments. This font
    is intended more for signage and headlines, not body text, but it would be nice
    to make a version for body text. Are you talking about the <em>U</em> in the name,
    where's its next to the <em>I</em>? I think it might be the combination of those
    two letters contributing to an unbalanced feeling. \r\n\r\n"
