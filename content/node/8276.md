  <BR> <BR>all texts will be english and persian. <BR> <BR>now i&#39;m looking for
  fonts to match that concept. i thought of underwares &#34;dolly&#34; but have no
  clue what arab/persian font could fit.  <BR>do you think i should use a font that

    shall we say while Hassan is more &#34;graphic&#34;. I would favor Hassan because
    I think it&#39;s more appealing to children, and because I suspect it&#39;s more
    appealing to Persians - but I&#39;m not sure. <BR> <BR>If you go with Hassan,

  body: Agreed, do  not follow the current showings of the Arabic on the Linotype
    website. I am assisting Linotype in revising these - at the moment they are just
    trials as the formats vary - and there should be a sensible showing in January.
    The second page of the pdf samples are just the Latin pages set with Arabic fonts,
    so they are gibberish. There will be proper textx samples in due course. <BR>
    <BR>I am pretty certain that all the Linotype Arabic fonts contain Farsi characters
    &#40;including numerals&#41;. The two fonts that are designed for Farsi &#40;note
    the counters&#41; are Nazanin and Mitra.  <BR>The former is particularly popular
    but neither are  yet in OpenType format - you would need to contact Thomas Caldwell
    at Lintoype for a date, also about Hassan if you follow Hrant&#39;s suggestion.
    <BR> Lotus is Linotype&#39;s most popular text font for quality bookwork. Yakout
    is the most popular font for newspaper text and brochures. Both contain the necessary
    characters and are available in OpenType format &#40;even though the website currently
    only shows the Type 1 Yakout&#41;. The samples John mentions would give you better
    information. I don&#39;t think I have a set that I can send you, but perhaps John
    would kindly put up a pdf for you of the fonts in which you are interested. Please

  body: Titus, the degree to which Latin and Arabic can be &#34;formally&#34; reconciled
    is indeed severely limited - and when people ignore this they end up with caricatures
    of visible language which can appeal only to fanatical graphic designers or cultural
    chauvinists. But whenever the two are in one place they can&#39;t just ignore
    each other either. They have to balance each other somehow or other, and one generally
    important factor is apparent importance - when one has too much and the other
    too little you&#39;ll piss half the people off - much easier to do than pleasing
    half the people!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: When two scripts are completely unrelated in form, I find that the best way
    to harmonise their appearence together -- to reconcile them, to use Hrant&#39;s
    term -- is to carefully balance weight and height so that neither looks too large
    or too heavy relative to the other. Some of the best examples of harmonious setting
    of Arabic and Latin text I&#39;ve seen are actually in very old books, in which
    two obviously independent fonts have been sensitively combined simply with an
    eye to their relative size. In this approach, neither script is adapted to the
    other, but both are allowed to maintain their own authentic characteristics, although
    the fact that the Latin types in these books are French renaissance book faces
    with small x-heights and long extenders does help them to harmonise easily with
    the Arabic. I had this in mind when I designed the Latin portion of the Arabic
    Typesetting font.&#42; <BR> <BR>&#42;Unfortunately, I think my Latin harmonises
    better with Paul Nelson&#39;s original Arabic design, for which I drew it, than
    with Mamoun Sakkal&#39;s final and much revised Arabic design. Ideally, I should
    have gone back to the Latin after Mamoun completed his revisiones, but there was
    no time or budget left for that unanticipated work.

    your cataloguing system, so it tells you whether you have something, but doesn&#39;t
    tell you how to find it? :-&#41; I recently organized all my type materials, and
    now it&#39;s much easier for me to find something. I have eight or so categories,
    with each small enough that it&#39;s feasible to search through to find a specific
    item. But the catalogue is still in my head. Sometimes I forget I have something
    &#40;although I very rarely I think I have something I don&#39;t, which is the
    biggest time drain&#41; but usually there&#39;s at least a faint memory of every
    single item for me to know which pile to look in. One day I could do a &#34;formal&#34;
    catalog &#40;which would enable the distinct advantage of having an item in more

    shelf-number system, but I&#39;m holding off doing this until I move and can get
    things properly organised. Currently about a third of the books are in piles on
    the floor or taking up table space. The primary goal of the catalogue was, indeed,
    so I would know what I have. I was standing in a bookshop in London a couple of
    years ago, holding a volume in my hand, and couldn&#39;t remember whether I already
    owned it. That was when I decided I needed a catalogue. Now I have a fairly detailed
    catalogue on my PalmPilot.

    a Microsoft exclusive typeface, originated by Paul Nelson at MS Typography, who
    drew the first version of the Arabic, which was then revised by Mamoun. It is
    part of MS&#39;s remarkable commitment to quality typography across a range of
    scripts. In terms of Unicode-compliant text handling, MS Publisher is actually
    the second-best page layout app for the Arabic script, after InDesign ME. MS Office

    about 650 volumes, 594 of which are currently catalogued. Unfortunately, my cataloguer
    recently took a job with a library in California, so I either need to find someone
    else or catalogue the recent purchases myself. About two thirds of the library
    are general, i.e. predominantly Latin, typography and calligraphy, and one third
    is non-Latin stuff. I expect it to be half-and-half soon, since I&#39;m buying
    more non-Latin than Latin. Unlike a lot of my colleagues&#39; libraries, which
    tend to include lots of old type specimen books, most of my collection is what
    may be termed scholarly, with a lot of palaeography books, which are generally
    the most interesting material for non-Latin script. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll go to some
    lengths and expense to get my own copy of a book before I settle for a photocopy.
    What tends to happen is that I go to St Bride&#39;s and browse in a number of
    areas that interest me, identifying worthwhile books, and then come home and start
    ordering them through ABE.

    feels very feminine, soft and graceful. It suits persian text and would need a

    help. Look at the closed counters and see how small they are? You don&#39;t need
    an e that small, but a large x-height with generous counters will look monstrous
    next to the delicacy of the Arabic. Definitely some modulation on the Latin. Hope

    I guess ghrnaaTa is Granada? Isn&#39;t that written with a qaaf? Since &#34;qrn&#34;
    means &#34;horn&#34; and that&#39;s a common part of place names? Not sure. And
    does &#34;taSmeem&#34; mean &#34;design&#34;? Anyway, it seems nice. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Paco, <BR>There&#39;s a spelling mistake in the first line :-&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    very much like your logo, and am very happy that you are interested in Arabic.
    Some of the best Arabic calligraphy started in Spain and Morocco. <BR> <BR>The
    Latin is much better resolved than the Arabic, which might need some adjustments
    of its internal proportions.  <BR> <BR>The kufi style is a good choice though
    the large x-height of the Latin is not helping. It feels also like the Latin flows
    better than the Arabic. You might need to make some adjustments that will help
    the rhythm. <BR> <BR>- the mim is too small <BR>- the reh feels like it&#39;s
    tipping backwards. It really needs a vertical stem in the koufi style <BR>- the
    jim family is a bit unbalanced. The top part moves forward too much <BR>- the
    beh needs to be wider &#40;comparable to kaf&#41; <BR>- no need for lam-mim ligature.
    The structure you use is more a naskh than a koufi <BR>- the sin is widely spaced
    in comprison to the beh family &#40;compare sin followed by teh, and shin followed
    by nun&#41; <BR>- the waw seems very big &#40;counter is similar in size to mim&#41;
    <BR>- spacing of &#34;Espania&#34; seems very tight in comaprison to others <BR>
    <BR>I hope you find this helpful. I am attaching the same text in 3 kufi fonts
    so that you can look at them. They have the correct spelling :-&#41; <BR><img

  body: hello all,  <BR>my internet connection was down for the last 4 days, a strange
    feeling ... <BR> <BR>paco, thank you for your generosity but i think it doesn&#39;t
    really fit my needs this time. <BR> <BR>i have two new proposals. <BR>i believe
    stempel schneidler could be nice. the color is very close, it is as soft and smooth
    as nazanin and has quite small counters and x-height. <BR>the second proposal
    is custodia. a bit sharper but the counters are smaller. <BR>i am curious to hear
    your opinions. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/56993.gif"

    combines very well with a number of Arabic faces.
