  to another, when you open the metrics window, it shows you have '0' pairs, when
  in the OpenType panel window and the Classes panel window it has all of the your
  kerning/class info\u2026 is there an easy way to compile the info so it shows all
  kerning pairs like it should in the metrics window?"

  body: "In the OpenType panel I 'Copy features from a font\u2026' which includes
    the 'kern' feature\u2026 and in the Classes panel I 'Copy classes from a font\u2026'\r\n\r\nI
    guess in addition to that I'd need to, from the Metrics panel 'Save Metrics' and
    then 'Open Metrics' in the new font file to complete the process?\r\n\r\nI don't
    do this often but what happens is, sometimes I get caught up in the process of
    making changes to certain glyphs and/or making tweaks to additional weights of
    a particular font and I've often accidentally copy and pasted over some of the
    red marked 'key glyphs' to where, when I finish I basically want to just go back
    to the original un-touched weight and copy over all the kerning and class data
    to the additional weights or to the additional file I'm working in to ensure the
    data matches and nothing was 'thrown-off' in the process\u2026 not sure if that
    makes sense but that is why I was looking for ALL of the data to be copied over
    regarding kerning and classes\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

    panel and an .afm file from the Metrics Window, and then import those two. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
