body: Anybody know if there is a postcript or opentype version available of a font
  commonly known as Prisma, I have a TT version which wont outline in illustrator.
  The typeface is made up of four geometric thin lines and it looks like it is based
  around Futura or similar and as far as I can tell ther is only a caps version.

    as a film typeface. I show a number of old scans as well as some current multi-line
    fonts in the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html\" target=\"new\">Lined
    Fonts ID Guide</a>. That might help you find an alternative. Sources are listed
    in the Guide.\r\n\r\nAnother possbility, which may not work well, is to convert
    the font from TTF to Type1. I say it may not work well, because the TT outlines
    may not be good quality, and that would make 'garbage in- garbage out' situation.\r\n\r\n-

  body: thanks for your help, I tried converting to all different formats through
    fontlab 4.6 - no joy, there seems to be charcters missing and some characters
    with missing strokes. I was convinced that there was a "proper" version of this
    font around, as in it may have a different name.Your link was very helpful but
    nothing of any real use for my current piece of design, I think I'll redraw the
    characters that don't outline correctly - unless anybody has an answer.

    That must have been a real bear to do.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could work on <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide05.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Stack</a> instead? I've never seen a digital version of that.
    Nah. The fact that Letraset holds the copyright probably rules Stack out."

    existing digitizations. Do you have a database with all this info? You must spend
    a lot of time scouring the web's free sites. If Dieter's fonts were shown with
    samples that didn't require clicking to a new page to see, I am sure I would have
    found many more useful revivals. As it is, many of my Guide samples have come
    from his collection.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing this one out. I'll be sure to
    add it to that Guide.\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Mike. I've got a very marked up Solotype Catalog in which I note every
    digitization (excluding renamed clones) that I find of a typeface shown in there.
    I've started, too, to make notations in my Homage To The Alphabet and an old VGC
    catalog as well for the typefaces in those that don't make an appearance in the
    Solotype Catalog.\r\n\r\nMy days of \"scouring the web's free sites\" \u2013 except
    for a few Asian ones - are well behind me. Pretty much the only freebie revivals
    I see any more come from those who contribute fonts directly to Cybapee's wonderful
    TypOasis. Herr Steffmann used to offer his fonts \u2013 complete with graphic
    samples \u2013 from his own website, but that got too expensive and Petra stepped
    in to the rescue (as seems to be in her nature).\r\n\r\nI rely on DaFont's New
    Releases to monitor what's out there freebie-wise and I check TypOasis and MyFonts'
    What's New pages regularly. On the latter, I love to see new revivals pop up by
    Dan Solo, Nick Curtis and Canada Type (the latter splendid old scripts, but you
    probably are well aware of their stuff)."

    It's amazing how many years those fonts have been offered on that web page - which
    has changed very little in all that time. I'd forgotten about it.\r\n\r\nI registered
    Stiletto Silver from Rafaael Dinner years ago (this being one of two digitizations
    I'm aware of of Calypso Initials), but somehow never made the connection between
    his Stack and the one in the Catalog."

    to Mac format (I use Fontgrapher, but there are cheaper options). For my purposes
    that has always worked well. \r\n\r\nI think typOasis is geared to <em>most</em>
    font users, which are PC users (just based on the distribution of computers, with
    Macs still not much above 10%), whether we like it or not. You'd also have to
    admit that not all font lovers are professional graphics designers (yet), and
    even that not all graphics designers use Macs any more.\r\n\r\nMike, I'd love
    to get my hands on your copy of the Solotype Catalog. I have also got mine full
    of notes, but I have apparently not been as thorough, or wide-ranging, in my correlations.\r\n\r\n-
