body: "Hello,\r\nI have created some really big .ttf-fonts: About 2.2 MB each! The
  fonts are display/logofonts, with a lot of graphic-effects such as scratches,\r\nholes,
  etc. Are there any way to reduce the fontsizes? The goal is to make them ready also
  for webfont usage ...\r\nThank you for any assistance in this case ;-) \r\nBest,

  body: "There are two possible problems, with different solutions. One is the overall
    font size which may be a factor in loading time as a webfont, and the other is
    glyph complexity.\r\n\r\nSome older systems, with less computing power or memory,
    are not able to render over-complex fonts. If your glyph complexity is the result
    of scanning artifacts with superfluous nodes, etc., the solution is a lot of detail
    work to clean them up. FontLab's \"optimize\" function can sometimes help, but
    its results need to be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the overall font size varies
    with your audience. Two megabytes over a relativel hi-speed internet connection
    isn't the worst thing in the world (the font is only downloaded once), but it
    could be very painful over slower connections. Reducing individual glyph complexity
    will help, but probably not significantly. \r\n\r\nYou can reduce the number of
    glyphs, use 'composed' glyphs (where parts of glyphs refer to parts of other glyphs
    instead of having separate outlines). This does NOT work for opentype fonts, but
    it does for TrueType. There are probably some other methods that I'm not aware
    of.\r\n\r\n- Herb"

    straight lines. When you have a fine rough texture the removal of data for curves
    makes the file smaller without affecting the results much.\r\n\r\n* http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4317579688\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "When using the optime function in FontLab it is a good idea to first copy
    al the glyphs to the Mask layer. It makes it very clear if glyphs have changed
    (to much).\r\nAnd for web you can use other formats than TrueType, so you could
    start with OpenType CCF and see what filesize you get after conversion. EOT and
    WOFF will give you a reduced filesize.\r\n\r\n@hrant. Very clever but reminds
    me much of the old converted TrueType's.... brrrr\r\n"

  body: OK, thanks. Well, I have now made a 'golden' solution, where I simply remove
    some characters + using FL's Optimize-function. That gives me 3 fonts that I now
    want to convert to .woff. Unfortunenately, I can't use the Online-converters ...
    are the font-files still too big? (860 KB, 1.1 MB, 721KB, .ttf)??

  body: You may be able to reduce the file size further by removing unnecessary metadata
    using a tool such as TTX. [[http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/the_smallest_font/|Mike
    Kamermans experimented with this]] to see how small he could make a TrueType font
    while still conforming to certain web font standards.
