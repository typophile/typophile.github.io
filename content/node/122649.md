  cover of a 1951 edition of cello music, published in Nice, France by Georges Delrieu
  & Cie. These are the only letters I have; the publication contains an inconsistent
  mixture of other typefaces."

    in the ends of the strokes (above), I suspect this was drawn using a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_pen|Rapidograph
    pen]] and a draftsman's template like the one below. The artist probably combined
    arcs from different-size circles or ellipses to make the <strong>V</strong>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/r-12_3965.jpg]"

  body: "Oops, my bad. Rotring didn't introduce the Rapidograph until 1953. But this
    title definitely looks like it was done by hand with some sort of drafting pen
    and template. \r\n\r\nThe artist may have improvised these letters using [[http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/KELeroy/3245-15L/3245-15L.htm|Leroy
    lettering tools]]. They have been in use since at least the 1930s, and according
    to [[http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/handwritten/tools.html|this source]],
    they were sometimes used in music publishing."

  body: Thanks, very interesting. I did wonder whether it was 'hand-drawn' in some
    way. One could only imagine, then, how other letters would look.
