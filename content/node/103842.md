    of my logo it would be deeply appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe logo is approximately 3
    years old however the guy that designed the logo has gone bust and cant get in
    contact with them.\r\n\r\nHoping that someone has the knowledge and can solve
    this mystery for me.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for anyone reading this.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nCaroline\r\n"
