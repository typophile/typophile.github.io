body: I&#39;d be interested in hearing the opinions of Typophile regulars concerning
  the potential for reviving the &#34;thorn&#34; character, or creating a new &#34;thorn-like&#34;
  character, for use in our western alphabetic system? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always found
  it curious that with the frequency that the &#34;th&#34; combination occurs, and
  how common compound &#34;th&#34; characters are in other alphabets, that it isn&#39;t
  a part of our Roman character set. This, despite the fact that for many centuries
  a compound &#34;th&#34; character was popular within the Latin abbreviatory system;
  and, of course, utilized within the English alphabetic system practically up till
  the 19th-century. <BR> <BR>Thoughts? <BR> <BR>dm

  body: Just thorn? Or eth also? Old English, like Icelandic to this day, had two
    letters denoting two different pronunciations that we now write with the pseudo-digraph
    <i>th</i>. The complication of modern English is that the contribution of other
    languages has multiplied the pronunciations that we represent with this pair of
    letters. To make any phonetic sense, one would want a separate letter to represent
    each phoneme. English may be too much of a mongrel tongue to support such systematic
    phonemic representation.

  body: No, not eth too, just thorn. Actually, not really thorn either. Merely a new
    single character condensing the &#34;th.&#34; I agree, English is too much of
    a mongrel language to start niggling such phonimic details &#40;lest we end up
    with 40 more characters in our alphabet&#41;. Since we don&#39;t establish such
    distinctions now with our current usage of the &#34;th&#34; combination I see
    no reason to start. I&#39;m thinking more along the lines of how the English employed
    the &#34;Y&#34; character as a pseudo-thorn as a space saver. <BR> <BR>Certainly
    not a critical typographic issue. Just a little design project I&#39;ve flirted
    with for personal entertainment off and on over the years. <BR> <BR>dm

    which &#34;th&#34;? the voiced or the unvoiced? i think that&#39;s the whole of
    what John was getting at... that if you&#39;re going to do one, you should do
    the other. and if you&#39;re going to start with &#34;th&#34; then why stop there?

  body: 'I understand your point, and it is a good one. That&#39;s why I would limit
    it to just a &#34;th&#34; character. The English scribes and engravers used one
    for a couple hundred years without feeling the need to produce a character for
    every sound. Though I must admit that having an &#34;sh&#34; character is appealing
    to me too. <BR> <BR>No doubt a good diacritical system in English would be a much
    better implementation. Especially in regard to things like names which in English
    can be almost totally subjective in spelling &amp; pronuciation. <BR> <BR>I guess
    what I&#39;m driving at is: If we were to adopt a new character representing &#34;th&#34;
    what would it look like? The &#34;Y&#34; substitution worked, but lends itself
    to confusion. The odoption of the original thorn doesn&#39;t blend well with roman
    characters. A straight ligature doesn&#39;t savve space; tho a condensed ligature
    &#40;such as with &amp;&#41; would. Something that was familiar would lend itself
    to quicker adoption. So what should it look like? <BR> <BR>dm'

  body: 'Especially since people are much more interested in using text to express
    their emotions without actually having to go to the trouble of finding the words
    to do so. ATF&#39;s abortive interrobang must have been one of the first efforts
    but technology prevented its adoption then even as it would have done now. What
    has succeeded are the emoticons that can be constructed from existing characters.
    Personally, I don&#39;t like them and don&#39;t even know how to read them but
    chacun etc. My objection is to any typographical character that interferes with
    the overall aesthetics of the typeface. Thus I faintly dislike the German ch simply
    on the grounds that the spacing between the characters is too tight, and I deplore
    the beloved Icelandic eth on the grounds that it has evolved into a shape that
    cannot be formally related to any other character in a font. In this respect,
    the specifications for the eth are precisely analogous to the original formal
    specifications for the Euro symbol: there was nothing you could do with it, unless
    you ignored the specification. <BR> <BR>In considering the standard PS set of
    characters, the glyph most in need of current reform is the eth, which sticks
    out like a sore thumb in every design where Icelandic taste is consulted. The
    only designer I can think of who was occasionally courageous &#40;or sneaky&#41;
    enough to put a stop to this aesthetic rot is Zapf. <BR> <BR>I think the EU should
    ban the character. Having first, one might hope, sent the Blairs to Elba. <BR>
    <BR>Another reason to reform the eth is that it is the character the typeface
    designer spends the most time on with the least result. What has this irascible
    race done to warrant such attention?'

  body: 'Designing an eth that both harmonises with the specific typeface and conforms
    to the normative form of the letter is often a challenge, but there is a great
    deal of satisfaction if one pulls it off. Often, the eth does not harmonise with
    the typeface very well, which I think is the source of Bill&#39;s dissatisfaction
    with the letter. But it seems to me that throwing out the normative form of the
    letter is no more satisfactory a solution than sticking any old eth in a typeface.
    Most eths are not very good because the people who draw them have not spent any
    time writing them: they look at the eth as a difficult design problem -- and as
    a chore --, and not as a letterform. <BR> <BR>The eth is a letter that originates
    in a time when the Latin script was written in a particular way with particular
    tool, and in a particular cultural milieu. Anyone who has seen the Beowulf manuscript
    in the British Library will know just how natural this letter looks in its original
    context. The problem of the eth for contemporary type designers is that we are
    obliged, for reasons of character set support, to include it in typefaces in styles
    that evolved in Italy, France and other parts of continental Europe, and in which
    the Icelandic language was never set until the 20th Century. The ductus of these
    type styles typically differs from that needed to make the letter eth, which means
    that one needs to rely on weight and proportion to harmonise forms, much as one
    does when trying to harmonise Greek and Latin designs without compromising the
    authentic forms of either script. <BR> <BR>The eth is a kind of time traveller:
    a visitor from an earlier version of our alphabet. That seems to me to be an interesting
    sort of challenge, and not something that one should deal with crudely. The past,
    as the saying goes, is a foreign country, so I tend to approach the eth with much
    the same strategy as I approach non-Latin scripts. <BR> <BR> <BR><i>What has this
    irascible race done to warrant such attention?</i> <BR> <BR>Icelanders? They joined
    NATO and allowed the US to build air bases in their country. The strategic importance
    of Iceland in NATO during the cold war guaranteed their alphabet representation
    in the ANSI character set for Western Europe.'

    welcome the revival of thorn and edh in English. It&#39;ll probably never happen,
    but that shouldn&#39;t dissuade designers and typographers from trying to sneak
    these letters in once in a while.

  body: "This in an interesting converstation. Especially since I am an Icelander.
    Here, in Iceland, the thorn and eth are natural characters of the alphabet. The
    two characters pop out quite frequently and are seldomly left out of a sentence.
    There have often been discussions about discontinuing the everyday use of them
    and replace them by \"th\" and \"d\". This has never been enforced though and
    probably never will. Icelanders are conservative people and love their language
    heritage.\r\n\r\nDespite the nation's love of those characters they have unfortunately
    presented a lot of problems in all kinds of areas over the years. For example
    Icelanders have, up until this day, had to patch their operating system to get
    the Icelandic characters right and we still have some problems with them in particular
    software programs.\r\n\r\nGunnlaugur SE Briem is and Icelandic type designer and
    on his website he talks a little about how to design the thorn and eth in a right
    way. Take a look: http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/index.htm\r\n\r\nIn my typographical
    compositions the thorn and the eth don't bother me as much as the accented capital
    letters like \"\xC1\" and \"\xC9\". They always seem to be in the way somehow
    and misalign with the cap height.\r\n\r\nRagnar Freyr\r\nwww.onrushdesign.com\r\nwww.formislandia.com"
