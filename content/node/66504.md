body: "The recent updates have had, to me, an interesting side effect: years old posts
  with great content are resurfacing, making Typophile a bit more fun to read.\r\n\r\nI
  think it would be cool if there were a feature that specifically highlights old
  posts that were both entertaining (Uli vs. the world, hrant vs. Nick Shinn) or educational
  (John Hudson vs. Maxim Zhukov, Kevin Larson vs. David Berlow)\r\n\r\nIt's a major
  failure of most blogs/forums to let their best content die in the archives. To new
  users, you always want to put your best foot forward.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

  body: "There are several topics of discussion that serve as major repositories of
    knowledge. It's one thing to have a Wiki document saying, \"bla bla bla\", but
    it's totally another to have a discussion where someone challenges that bla bla
    bla, or someone gives the background history of how the Romans invented bla bla
    bla, and it evolved into modern bla bla bla.\r\n\r\nGood stuff, that."

  body: I like that idea too. I'd noticed some good old stuff in the reshuffle too.
    Maybe something to think about if the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/66178>10th
    anniversary compilation idea</a> gets off the ground?
