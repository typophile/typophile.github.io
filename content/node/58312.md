  so, this is one possible solution... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lg-UN_5102.png]\r\n\r\nAlso
  does the spacing between the characters look right?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: I vote no on the un ligature. Also, the La is problematic. Considers shortening
    the L and kerning a tad more. Possibly raising up the serif to match the G (might
    stop readign as an L). Otherwise, looks ok to me. Perhaps a tad soft...Looks like
    it got a stroke our outline?

    but I'm thinking now it might not be the best choice.\r\nI'll see about making
    a sharper edged version."

  body: "It says \"LakersGround\" to me.\r\n\r\nThe spaces after \"L\" and \"G\" are
    quite distracting. In fact, the large version almost looks like \"L Akers G Round\".
    Try kerning them closer, but I suspect that you'll have to connect them as you
    did with the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nThe descender on the \"G\" may be aggravating
    the disturbance by breaking up the line."

- body: "\r\nIMHO,\r\n\r\nMore space is needed between the two words. La is too far
    apart, and L is a tad too small. I would try enlarging the L and dropping it beneath
    the a, pulling it much closer - kinda like this, but much less messy:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lakers_6595.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    think my dirty example here shows the L too big, but you get the idea. I'm not
    convinced it works much better, but I still think the L you have is problematic.

    >>>>> cool. I hadn\u2019t seen anyone use Fuel Script before, and using it for

    one of the coolest typefaces I've seen.  You and your partner did I great job.
    \ I hope my design did it some justice.  (I swear it was nothing personal that
    I squeezed it, removed the inktraps and blurred it to death ;)\r\n\r\nSo your
    a Lakers fan?  That's awesome.  I do most of the graphics and design (although
    we haven't updated in a long time) on [[http://forums.lakersground.net|LakersGround.net]],
    though I'm not a pro like you.\r\n\r\nI designed the logo you see there a while
    back.  Everyone seems to like it but I'm getting bored of staring at it all day
    every day. Thus this thread and possibly additional ones. =)\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nBTW
    here's a <strong> [[http://i44.tinypic.com/vyl6w6.png|sexy photoshopped]] </strong>
    version of the logo for those that are bored."
