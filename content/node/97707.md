  body: I also found this "Institution" font but, after checking (simply googling
    it...), it appears to be a WSI font so I decided not to talk about it, supposing
    it would be another of their rip-offs. I finally found Modula and decided to consider
    it as the unique valid answer I could give.

    \ :-)\r\n\r\nIn fact I even removed the name of the font from my post (which of
    course only makes sense if you guys do that too).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    customization of Emigre Modula. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\np.s. after seeing
    the responses I also removed the name. I have the font, but it may have come with
    one of those 500 fonts for $5 disks you could buy about 20 years ago. It's about
    that old."
