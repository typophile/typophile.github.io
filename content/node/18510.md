    image to see the word correctly (in essence, "backing up" from the image). Nifty

    letters, and manipulating them and sketching the results...which incidently looked
    horrible. Once you get the x,y,z thing in your head though it becomes easier to
    draw abstract stuff. Sorry for the ramble, and the dirt over the skecth, it's
