body: "I am working on an Arabic font.\r\nThe design is finalized but I am having
  some problems in making my generated font work on all of the applications.\r\n\r\nExample
  of same application: \r\nMy font is working properly on all Adobe Applications (Indesign
  ME, Photoshop ME and illustrator ME\u2026), on the contrary, it is showing well
  in Safari but the glyphs are not linking. The application is not able to attach
  the glyphs and to substitute the isolated forms with its initial, medial or final
  form. And also on some application like Firefox it is not showing at all. As in
  Linotype FontExplorer X, it is also showing properly the glyphs but in the display
  window the glyphs are not attached also. Only isolated forms are present.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type-in-indesign1_6738.jpg]
  indesign\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type-in-browser1_6291.jpg] safari\r\n\r\nI
  am generating my fonts as TrueType fonts.\r\nAll the glyphs have proper Unicode
  values.\r\nThe names of the Glyphs are Uni----, \r\n(they start with Uni and then
  the Unicode number of each glyph).\r\nThe naming of the font is proper for TrueType
  and Opentype generation.\r\nThe encoding is set as Arabic.\r\n\r\nBut I still do
  not know what I am missing?\r\n\r\nAny help?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\npascal\r\n\r\n"

      in a few releases (eg. Mac OS X Meercat or Mac OS XI \u201CThe Oskeye\u201D)
      your font should work in Apple OS services (Adobe rolls it\u2019s own OT support
      to ensure cross-platform loveliness). Apple is publicly committed to OT, but
      they\u2019re <strong>not currently doing OpenType shaping engines that will
      support complex script languages</strong>.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

    and firefox.\r\nSome sites work on safari and some work on firefox.\r\nMost of
    the time if an Arabic type in a page is not linking on safari, if you open the
    same page in firefox it will link properly.\r\n\r\nSo I was also wondering what
    is the difference between the two applications.\r\n\r\npascal"

    trust as gospel anything an OS vendor tells you at a conference. They've been
    known to tell you what you want to hear in order to get free drinks at the bar.
    \r\n\r\n>So I was also wondering what is the difference between the two applications.\r\n\r\nMy
    guess, fall back - Safari is honoring the font specified in the HTML or CSS and
    Firefox is selecting a system font. "

  body: "thank you for your quick replies Simon.\r\n\r\nat first i thought that if
    the font is not working on safari then it is a problem in my font.\r\nit is good
    now that i know about the AAT stuff.\r\ni will look more into it.\r\nit is difficult
    to apply it on my font?\r\n\r\nand i was also putting my font in safari to look
    on the hinting stuff and how my font will look on the web.\r\n\r\nanyways, my
    main concern was about generating my Arabic font properly.\r\n\r\nThe thing is
    that also in Linotype FontExplorer X application (in the detailed preview window)
    my font is also not attached, the glyphs are only in the isolated forms.\r\n\r\nSo
    I though that the problem is the same for safari.. and the linotype explorer.\r\nI
    noticed that the Arabic fonts that are properly attached in the font explorer
    are also attached in safari.\r\n\r\nBut maybe the problem is not the same.\r\nOr
    maybe it is\r\n\r\npascal"

    able to work normally?\r\n\r\nanyways, concerning the naming of the arabic glyphs.\r\nthe
    thing is that normally the arabic glyphs have affi or uni names.\r\n\r\nbut when
    i am designing the font, it is easier for me to have my own naming.\r\nso i have
    made my own arabic encoding with my own personal naming of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nthis
    makes my design work much more friendly for me and faster to work in the font.\r\n\r\nbut
    when i need to generate the font is it better to make the names as affi or uni...\r\nsince
    affi is so complicated and there is no logic in it. i prefer to rename my glyphs
    as uni...\r\n\r\ncheck this thread out:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/20508\r\n"

    the very beginning) I was very depressed because I was outside. And when I recently
    spoke about it to my brother (who is a very different person than me, at least
    as far as I can tell) he had the same feelings. I suspect it depends on your age
    range though: the post-war (I mean the real one) generation was probably just
