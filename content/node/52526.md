body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI would like to invite everyone to participate of my Master's
  Thesis project. Type for Change is a democratic platform addressing typography as
  an instrument for social change. More details are available on Facebook:\r\n\r\nTYPE
  FOR CHANGE\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=10349618017\r\n\r\nBasically,
  there are 2 ways to contribute to this project:\r\n\r\n1) Creating a poster, t-shirt,
  font or dingbat focused on climate change\r\n\r\n2) Sharing it with your peers,
  friends, and students that would be eventually interested to participate of this
  initiative\r\n\r\nThe deadline is January 31st, 2009.\r\n\r\nQuestions, comments
  or suggestions would also be greatly appreciated. Please send a message to: \r\n\r\ngmachadodesign
