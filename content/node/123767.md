  does anybody know what is the name of the font that is used in the TBS SuperStation
  Graphics photo? The second font is very similar to Univers 39 Ultra Thin Condensed,
  but the ampersand \u201C&\u201D is slightly, The \u201CR\u201D, \u201CS\u201D, lowercase
  \u201Ca\u201D, \u201Cg\u201D and \u201Cy\u201D are different. That would be great
  if anybody knows."
