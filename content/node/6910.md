body: I&#39;m looking for a font similar to the Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s Ice Cream font.  I
  realize the font was originally hand drawn by a Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s former Design
  Director &#40;and named after her&#41;. As the company grew, she couldn&#39;t keep
  up with all the writing, so her hand lettering was converted to a computer format.  It
  is a proprietary font, owned by Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s and is not available for sale
  or downloading.  But does anyone have any idea as to what font would look similar

    but the original handlettering was probably based on something like these. '

    &amp; Jerry&#39;s typeface and similars but can&#39;t find it. <BR> <BR>You can
    also take a look  at the new Fountain&#39;s <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ftn_farao.asp"
