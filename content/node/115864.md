  body: "There is no reason to assume that a font is always the basis for tattoo lettering.
    I suspect many tattoo artists have created their own distinctive lettering styles.\r\n\r\nYou'd
    think if this was taken from a font that one of us would recognize the flamboyant
    initials, but I don't think I have seen them before, for whatever that's worth.\r\n\r\n-
