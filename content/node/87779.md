  an image via Photoshop, and I chose to manipulate this image: http://lissawriting.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/culture5.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  want to change out the words that they use with words of my own, but I want to use
  the same font and I cannot for the life of me figure out what font it is.\r\n\r\nThe
  project is due early this week, and I'm really nervous that I won't find the font
  in time...wondering if someone can help?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\nLaura"
