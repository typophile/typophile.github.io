  body: "Damien, thanks for posting in respectful way. This does seem to be the correct
    area for it so I will not move it. \r\n\r\nI will note that it would be better
    if you registered under a real and full name. It would show that you are willing
    to be accountable for the use of your Typophile account.\r\n\r\nIn response to
    James, this is the kind of post that seems very close to spam but isn't going
    to get called that here simply because it has a plausible design/font relationship.
    I am not going to say \"bloody vultures\" but I will admit that this doesn't seem
    like the kind of offer I would encourage someone to try."

  body: "In fact, let me continue for a minute. I went to Camberwell art college in
    2004, with depleted resources, lack of space, and double the numbers there should
    have been, tuition fees, top-up fees, major sacking of all first year tutors (too
    rock and roll) to be replaced by idiots, student bar closing at 8 on a Friday,
    only to leave college and work on my first pitch for the \"Ethical Tea partnership\".
    This was 'brokered' by some wank fuck PR agency that made us pitch for free for
    3 rounds, during which they revealed to us the ideas of other designers, suggesting
    directions. We got to the final 3 and didn't make it, stating in the email that
    if we wanted further info they'd give it. We asked and they couldn't be bothered.
    Total money made: none.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my degree I was sent a questionnaire
    by University of the Arts London, asking me what I was doing now. The letter attempted
    to persuade me by offering me the chance to enter a draw and win \xA3100 worth
    of Topman vouchers; I threw that in the bin, and I humbly suggest sir, that you
    do likewise with your offer."
