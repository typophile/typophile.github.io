  It's being used by Banana Republic in their stores on artful signage. Sorry in advance
  for the blurriness. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2436_6669.JPG]"

  body: "I think you're right. I realized as soon as I tried the Helvetica R I was
    wrong. It feels slightly bolder than TG Bold Cond 20 but don't think it could
    be anything else because that's the boldest condensed TG has right? \r\n\r\nThanks
    Ryuk!\r\n\r\n"
