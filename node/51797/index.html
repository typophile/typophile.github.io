  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey typophiles,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a new logo for our company on and off for ages and feel I&rsquo;d benefit from an impartial critique of the current favourite. I&rsquo;m not too sure about the kerning and the alterations I have made to the letters and would like to hear what you think.</p>
<p>A little background about our company and who the target &lsquo;market&rsquo; would be. We are an interactive agency specialising in high-end flash websites and online production. Our current clients are mostly television/film production companies, photographers and various advertising agencies.</p>
<p>The aesthetic I was going for with the logo is modern and clean while retaining a sense of playfulness. I also want the logo to feel a little retro without being too derivative..</p>
<p>Any comments greatly appreciated, this is not really my forte and has been a lot harder than I imagined!</p>
<p>p.s. The bird is a &lsquo;Gladeye&rsquo; and would be used both in conjunction with the name and on its own.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Love the version with the bird sitting on the lettering! Exploring various modes of conjunction may be a good idea, though; in small applications like business cards, the bird will likely suffer when it is this small, especially seeing that it has a much higher level of detail than the lettering already.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this offers a great wealth of possibilities. Why not make the bird a brand character, like a mascot? Depending on media / context, he could even be animated, sit on the logo in different ways, flap his wings, maybe pick away at the counters or attack the mouse cursor from time to time … especially seeing that you do interactive and probably animated work, that may be a befitting (and fun) expansion of the &lsquo;logo&rsquo; idea. (Reminds me a bit of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what the TYPO Berlin conference in 2006 did with the cat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> – they had a black Flash cat as a mascot, who &lsquo;lived&rsquo; on the website. She&rsquo;d often sit still for a while, but had a number of (sometimes surprising, playful and funny) behaviours that were randomly played; a whole bunch of people came back to the website just to see &lsquo;what the cat was doing&rsquo;, and she became the secret star of the conference).</p>

<p>altaira: Thank you for your ideas, the TYPO Berlin website and their use of the cat mascot is really cool. I was in Berlin at the same time as that conference but wasn&rsquo;t aware of it, shame! I like the idea of the bird as a brand character that we can use independently and we are in the process of redesigning our website so an animated character works well with our new ideas.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So, I have spent the last few days trying different combinations of a join between the letters e-y-e and am feeling a little stumped.</p>
<p>This is the best I have come up with so far. I took the approach of following the line of the first e through to connect with the center of the second e.</p>
<p>Any suggestions regarding this approach? Anyone think of a more natural connection between such difficult letters?</p>
<p>Gerald: I had a try at enlarging the g in response to your comment but felt it started to get a little out of proportion. In the end I have kept it the same size as the earlier post.

I think your first version is more successful than the second ones that are connected by far. I think the reason the eye is so different because of the tops of the y are not near as round as the rest of the characters. Try tweaking those a bit and see if that leads you anywhere.</div>

<p>I like the idea of rounding the terminals on the e-y-e and also Robert&rsquo;s idea for joining those letters, so will try both. I have really struggled to join those last 3 letters without distorting the first e and I was not happy with the latest version I posted.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Gerald and Robert, Thank you for taking the time to mock up different approaches to the connections.</p>
<p>I did have several attempts at the connection you suggested Robert but felt the e-y-e ended up a little too tightly kerned in relation to the rest of the letters. I agree that it does seem the most natural connection but I worry that at smaller sizes the last three letters will run together. I think the e-y works better than the y-e as it makes the top right side of the y rather heavy.. I will have another crack at it this afternoon and see how I feel about it.</p>
<p>Gerald, I don&rsquo;t mind the connection of the tail of the y to the e, I haven&rsquo;t tried that so will give it a go. The second suggestion I did try and was not happy with the way the last e sat on the end of the word and also the top right side of the y ends up rather heavy.</p>
