  body: "Initially, I want to recognize something in the pear, but I see a 'c' and
    possibly an 'r'. Not knowing if that's right or if I'm supposed to be seeing those
    letters, it's a poor point of focus.\r\n\r\nI also think the position title face
    is unnecessarily busy. \r\n\r\nYou have a lot of conflicting parts and it's making
    my eye jump all over the place. Remember the KISS system from school: \"Keep it
    simple, students\".\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Needs more work - or maybe less work. The pos/neg space is an eye. The other
    shape obvious. No c or r intended but I see it now. I admit it's forced and confusing.
    I'm working with the pear shape and trying to turn it into something. Maybe I'll
    stick with the starting point. Nothing conceptual about it, but here's a simpler
    version:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/davidpear2_6281.gif]

  body: Now it seems you have too many weights happening to my eye. I might try matching
    the outline of the pear to the weight of "pear," and maybe outline the leaf to
    match the weight of "david".

  body: Leaf/stem from the first one, pear shape from the second one, name type from
    the first one, and I think find something else for "art direction".

    a lot of work though, but it would make a much better logo I think.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: I like the leaf/stem from the first one too. I agree with  Century Gothic
    for your name and something different for "art direction". I'd keep it smaller,
    simple. I like the upper part of the pear from the first, maybe finish it out.

  body: How about cutting the right half of the pear image off to form a lowercase
    'd' (the left shape of the pear forming a lowercase 'd') and put the leaf on the
    ascender of the 'd'...

  body: David, I like the form you've got working there with half the pear but I don't
    feel like the type is doing it any favors at this point. I think I'd rather see
    the type a bit more uniform in weight/style, maybe breaking up the first and last
    with two different colors?

  body: Along the lines of Chrisfig thoughts, make the dark green leaf an outline
    with the weight of the "david" even with the veins of a leaf.
