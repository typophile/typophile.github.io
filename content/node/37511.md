body: "I\u2019ve just begun to notice this, but some book titles italicize words (such
  as prepositions) that are not capitalized.  The first time I noticed it was in Robert
  Bringhurst\u2019s \u201CThe Elements <em>of</em> Typographic Style\u201D, then on
  the cover of a Dick Francis novel.\r\n\r\nIs this an accepted style?  I mean, Bringhurst
  uses it, but he doesn\u2019t mention it in the book that I\u2019ve found.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2110\u2134\u212F\u2113"

  body: I've done it. Accepted? If Bringhurst does it then what's the problem?

  body: It's merely a design convention, used primarily because "of" looks more interesting
    italicized (as does "the" in many cases). On the other hand, book titles as a
    whole should be italicized rather than put in quotes. If "of-italicization" were
    a rule, the title would look like <em>The Elements</em> of <em>Typographic Style</em>...which
    looks pretty dumb.

  body: Title typography on book covers and title pages often uses many (hopefully
    not all at the same time) devices such as bold, all caps, italics, different fonts
    for different words, different colours for different words, etc. for design purposes
    and emphasis. But when cited in normal text, the convention is all italic in lower
    case, with first letters of appropriate words in uppercase according to established
    style rules; all other typographic treatments are dropped.

  body: "I\u2019m aware of the convention for citing book titles in-line, I just needed
    to demonstrate the typographic shtick I was referring to.\r\n\r\nAnd I suppose
    my question could have been worded better: Is there somewhere a set of the commonest
    conventions book titles?\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2110\u2134\u212F\u2113"

  body: I doubt you'd find such a list. But this is a common enough convention on
    book covers. I've seen it in print ads too.

  body: I'm not sure about conventions or lists, but in graphic design you can do
    pretty much anything you want, as long as it works. Some of my "rules" of good
    typography are broken all the time, and the 90% of the time it was done correctly
    (assuming pro designers -- with students and amateurs, the numbers quickly reverse),
    then these become exceptions to the rule. The other 10% prove the rule.
