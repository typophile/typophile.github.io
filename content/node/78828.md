body: "This is a pretty haggard font, also because I put a gradient map over the text
  to make it more visible. It is not hand drawn or handset as it appears to be. I've
  seen this graphic designer use it many times. It looks expensive, something like
  YouWorkForThem would showcase. Any ideas? -thanks\r\n<a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=35mmgy9\"

  body: "I've looked in a number of places, but have only been able to find fonts
    with a similar feel which are not identical to your sample.\r\n\r\nHere are some
    that I thought were either close in letterforms, or overall look: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jesse-tilley/lions-den/\">Lions
    Den</a>, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/matterhorn/\">Matterhorn</a>,
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dogheaded/lucidity/\">Lucidity</a>, <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pintassilgo/amarelinha/\">Amarelinha</a> and
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lettering-delights/absurd/\">LD Absurd</a>.\r\n\r\nMy
    feeling after searching MyFonts with as many keywords as I could think of to describe
    this is that this is probably a custom (personal) font, that could be drawn by
    anyone and made for $10. Even though this font has a 'style' in these squared
    off tall letters, it is like any other hand-drawn font that could be made by anyone.
    I checked Abstract Fonts for freebies, but this was not in their collection either.\r\n\r\n-
