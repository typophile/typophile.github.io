body: "hi everyone,\r\ni'm on the hunt for a typeface with a basic, 'default' quality
  - something which looks like it has been produced on some sort of lo-fi data printing
  machine. I've found a good one (plotter book, listed in the back of Most Beautiful
  Swiss Books '07) but it isn't commercially available.  Another one i'm interested
  in was used by GTF for their vacuum-formed 'The/Le Garage' poster - but i'm not
  sure what it is. You can see it here: http://www.graphicthoughtfacility.com/projects/37/9
  (sorry for the poor image - was the best i could find).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would
  be accepted with gratitude!\r\nThanks"

  body: Huh. Something with the essence of a default choice, looks like it was output
    on a lo-fi printing machine? Maybe OCR? VAG? Or Courier? But maybe you want something
    a bit more different then those choices.

    just right."
