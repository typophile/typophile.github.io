  body: If there&#39;s no alternate version of that same typeface <BR>with this feature,
    I guess it doesn&#39;t exist. You&#39;ll <BR>have to do it manually with baseline
    shift. Everybody  <BR>else does it that way. Why do you need a version with  <BR>caps
    extending below the baseline?

  body: Can you post the lousy copy of the actual font you&#39;re looking for? Perhaps
    this wil clear up the confusion.
