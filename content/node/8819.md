    F</a> from Fountain is somewhat similar, but does not match. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    trying to search for unicase fonts, but it&#39;s possible this is faux unicase.

    of posting a duplicate thread. Let&#39;s hope somebody finds  <BR>your font.

  body: Brian, is this a logo? Do you have samples of other letters or numerals?

  body: Thanks for looking anyway. My initial thought was that it was something from
    Fountain; and Stalemate, if customized, could be pretty close. <BR> <BR>It is
    a logo for a marketing studio in Vancouver Canada, and these were the only characters
    I could find. It probably has some custom adjustments done but I still like the
    basic feel of it. I&#39;ve asked the studio if it was a font, but haven&#39;t
    gotten a response yet.

  body: I think it is it. They just made a few modifications for the logo. Notice
    how, except for the little notch, the e matches exactly. The n is also an exact
    match. Looks like they used the small-cap G and just lengthened the right stroke.
