  body: "This seems very similar to brush scripts in a rather poor collection by Expresiv
    Fonts. One called ShaSha36 seems close. The attempts to fit these as connected
    letters on your sample suggest that the font may have been as disconnected as
    my sample. The tails all look like the same stroke was added to each letter.\r\n\r\n-
