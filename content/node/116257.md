  body: "I have the Novel Fonts set from about 1994 and it is spelled \"Houston\".
    My notes say it is actually Husky Script (Solotype catalog, p.104), as the Opti
    name suggests. I agree with Dick that this seems to be the answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    to identify the font from just two letters. But this is all I had.\r\nI am using
    OPTIHusky for this one.\r\nThank you once again!"
