  family called 'Avocet'.\r\n\r\nAs I've been slaving away in my artist's garret with
  no feedback, I was just wondering if I'm heading in the right direction. I think
  the ligated characters could look pretty good if used sparingly. I find that I get
  slightly irritated if I'm reading long text passages with lots of these. Does anybody
  feel the same?\r\n\r\nThe caps are a bit quirky, but I think they look unified nonetheless.\r\n\r\nAny
  (positive) comments gratefully appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNick Cooke

  body: "This is lovely, Nick. Very much in the style of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Chianti\">Chianti</a>
    and <a href=\"http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=200\">Vista</a> but more playful. As
    for the long reading potential, it would be good to have a PDF with 9-11 pt. type
    so we could print and test.\r\n\r\n- The Q tail seems to straight next to the
    ears and tails of the other caps.\r\n- Some of your straight stems (i, j, b) -
    especially in bold - could use the flaring found in other verticals (m, n, u)
    - but maybe that's just the low-res image playing tricks\r\n- The bold 'g' could
    use some squaring to increase the counter size"

    I don't have too much skill on that (and my english is poor), but I can tell that
    I like it. Only a couple of questions: \r\n\r\nI think the lower part of the 'z'
    it's a bit odd, maybe too much curved? \r\nDon't you think that when you put it
    in 10 pt some parts of the 'e', 'a', 'u', 'r' lowercase would dissappear?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is very nice. I generally don't like letters that begin or end with
    flat terminals, but they seem to suit this one very well.\r\n\r\n-q- needs to
    be more open, could be the stroke is too heavy\r\n-g- both seem to sit too high
    on the baseline. I'd say both thin and bold need a little larger upstairs counter.\r\n-E-
    (thin more than bold) Visually it is leaning to the left, probably because the
    stems appear to increase in length from top to bottom\r\n\r\nI really don't like
    st ligatures, but yours is working. Would love to see it in a paragraph of text.
    I think they are generally over-designed and call too much attention to themselves.\r\n\r\nLove
    both U/lc zeds. "

    is already the name of a font.

  body: "Stephen has already mentioned Chianti, which this reminded me of; also look
    at Goudy Sans and Gary Munch's new Candara for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nI think this
    is still busy with conflicting directions: pleasingly informal at times (VRac)
    and rigid at others (EMSAbox). I'd like to see it moved in the direction of informality,
    with less straight stems. Then, you might find that some of the little in-strokes
    (EFPZ) aren't necessary. I'd also consider allowing those entrance strokes to
    be at various angles, instead of strictly vertical. They could also have varying
    thicknesses, since you've introduced some tapering elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe bold
    looks a little cramped in its character widths. LC 'a' especially doesn't feel
    as playful in the bold as in the roman. The bold shows a very predominant vertical
    stress, which I think fights the informal elements. "

  body: "You might want to consider a small top left serif on the captial 'J'.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me that the bold lowercase 'o' has too much stroke contrast; that is,
    its top and bottom are too thin."
