    at design as they are at critical thinking.

  body: The next type battle should be a "Rand Paul" advertisement that looks like
    it was designed by Paul Rand. Or maybe it should be for "Senator Paul Rand" instead....

  body: For me it's really just forgetting to hang the quotation marks. It looks trashy.
    Like, it literally looks like some random shmuck off the street thew this together
    in fifteen seconds. It's not like this guy doesn't have the fund to hire a designer
    to do things for him, why skimp on something like this?
