  of an underline, I realise that every case is unique depending on font, size, weight
  etc but i was wondering if there are any general rules of thumb or if it comes down
  to purely personal aesthetic choice?\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: On the rare occasions that I use underscoring, I make it match the weight
    of the thin strokes of the typeface. This is often about .5 point for a text size
    serif font. I position it well below all descenders.
