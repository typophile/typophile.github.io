body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI was recently checking out how some companies' logos have [[http://designslounge.com/2011/07/corporate-logo-evolution-part-one/|evolved
  over the years]], and I'm starting to feel that perhaps we need a new logo. For
  the past 7 or 8 years, we have used this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ns_current_3932.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  has, essentially, remained exactly the same throughout the years. (Though, I think
  I changed the height of the headphones a couple of years ago.) It uses ITC Avant
  Garde Gothic Condensed, which I vertically shrunk down to 80% of original. The headphones
  are from Audio Pi and I shrunk the height of that also (75%).\r\n\r\nAnyway, a few
  minor kerning issues aside, I'm still rather fond of the logo and it has served
  us well for a good many years. However, I am beginning to feel it misrepresents
  the company's current activities. When I designed the logo, we were actually mostly
  known for our sampled instruments (VSTi), so it wasn't really a record label at
  all. Since then, the recording side of the company has really taken over and the
  sampled instrument side of things is dormant.\r\n\r\nThe record label's catalogue
  is fairly diverse, but it is tied together by a common aesthetic of clean recording,
  attention to detail, and natural sound presentation. All our releases are of classical
  and acoustic music.\r\n\r\nIn the current logo, I like that the headphones show
  that we are somehow music related, but I think it perhaps suggest that we are an
  dance/electronica label, especially coupled with a font like Avant Garde. Would
  you agree? Do you think a new logo would be a good idea?\r\n\r\nI'm currently toying
  with dropping the headphones, and have been endlessly searching for a new font.
  Thinking of this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ns_new-idea1_4737.png]\r\n\r\nI
  don't want to completely lose the identity we have established with the old logo.
  I toyed with \"natural\" in a serif font and \"studio\" in a sans, but I think it
  looks a bit tacky. Also, thinking about \"NSR\", but that seems to generic.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts? I'm at the early stages here, so it would be great to get some feedback.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDouglas."

    it could do with being a touch more difference between the two weights, but I
    would't like to go too far.\r\n\r\nI think for now, I'll try without the headphones.
    I did experiment a bit with a centred dot between the words, and that kind of
    looked cool."

    no break, you need to have a greater difference in style between the 2 words.
    I know you have a difference in weight, but to me it's slightly too subtle. Maybe
    putting one word in a different color or shade would help.\r\n\r\nAnother option
    -- if you decide to keep the headphones -- is to make both words the same style
    but separate them by putting the headphones between them. Maybe a black or colored
    circle that's slightly bigger than the headphones with the headphones reversed
    out of the circle in white. "

  body: "> I would prefer it to be one colour and not use shading\r\n\r\nI understand,
    but keep in mind that there are fewer and fewer situations these days where color
    -- or at least shading -- are impractical or cost more. Many companies these days
    communicate primarily via the web, PDFs, emails, PowerPoints, etc., where color
    and shading cost no more than black-and-white.  And even in conventional printing,
    shading is usually not a problem. "

    is missing to me is a clarity about the image that the brand should project.  I
    think some deeper digging into the genre and how you are unique within it is the
    basis for a great concept.  A nice looking typeface is not going to be a substitute
    for a brandmark that actually communicates who you really are.  Good luck, I find
    it is often easier to capture a brand identity with an image rather than with
    text only, but in this case, none of your examples suggest anything classical
    or acoustic.   '

    random chance and very little like any actual design process is taking place.

  body: "Thanks, everyone, for the comments and criticism.\r\n\r\nFirst, allow me
    to clarify my experience when it comes to design and typography. I am not a designer
    by trade, but I have been involved in design work and the design process for many
    years. This has mostly been for my own record label, but the odd thing here and
    there for other people too. It's been trial an error learning.\r\n\r\nIn all honesty,
    there wasn't much thought that went into the new design shown above - I simply
    put it there to gather some initial thoughts.\r\n\r\nJamesM - I hear you about
    shading etc. I wasn't really referring to cost. Just that I wouldn't like to 100%
    rely on shading or colour - somehow seems like a bit of a cheat or less purist
    or something. Will certainly consider it, though.\r\n\r\nFrode Frank - random
    chance? Not really. The current logo actually went through a design process and,
    were the company still focused on the same business activities, I'd still be quite
    satisfied with it. I'd maybe change the font and adjust some proportions, but
    fundamentally, it does and says what I want. The new logo - as I mentioned above
    - it was really just a starting point to see if it's worth continuing with the
    idea current logo, or whether I should go down a different route. Just sort of
    feeling my way at the moment. I would love to hire a designer I loved, even just
    to get another viewpoint, but we don't have the funds for that. (and to answer
    your question: no I don't pull in nitwits to handle our recordings, I do it all
    myself from recording to release.) However, despite design/type not being my official
    trade, I feel I am quite savvy to both and am happy to make a go of it myself
    - with a little help of people like you on forums such as this.\r\n\r\nLuma Vine
    \ - yes, I've been giving the concept some thought. The genres of music on the
    label will become more diverse in the coming years, so that makes it hard to pin
    down a look. We're not really a gimmicky label, and not tied to one specific genre.
    The name still works for us - suggesting a faithful, natural representation of
    the original sound. An image alone is tricky. So many of the things that suggest
    \"recording\" have already been used by other labels. I have been experimenting
    with spirals, a reference to records/vinyl/CDs, and there may be something in
    that. Interestingly, though - almost all the labels I really admire don't have
    an image at all - [[http://www.ecmrecords.com|ECM]], [[http://www.nonesuch.com|Nonesuch]],
    [[http://www.runegrammofon.com|Rune Grammofon]], and the ones that do have logos,
    I think they're terrible designs. Perhaps it is because with simple text, it's
    easier to seem more generic? The logo is able to suit all the different types
    of music.\r\n\r\nThanks again and keep the comments coming - it's really helping!\r\n\r\n"

    \ Here is my outline:\r\n\r\nResearch & briefing\r\nBrainstorming\r\nSketching\r\nComputer
    rendering\r\n\r\nThat along with a heavy dose of feedback where you jump to a
    previous stage to work out new ideas.  But to me it sounds like you jumped to
    the last stage.\r\n\r\nI would definitely avoid trying to represent 'recordings'.
    \ That is not what makes you unique, it is what makes you exactly like every one
    of your competitors, you all make recordings.\r\n\r\nA big question that needs
    to be answered in the brief is whether you are a recording studio or a record
    label.  Maybe there is some precedent, but I don't know of any brand that exists
    publicly as both.\r\n\r\nI do get the idea of covering many genres, but I think
    there is still something that ties it all together.  The last thing you want is
    to be generic.  This is where some good research and brainstorming are essential.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps."

    I guess I'm just doing all stages at once! These computer renders are as much

    I definitely hear what you saying. It's typical of me to jump in at the deep end.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you say \"I would definitely avoid trying to represent 'recordings'. That is not
    what makes you unique, it is what makes you exactly like every one of your competitors,

    that logo should give some indication as to what we do.\r\n\r\nWe are a record
    label, but actually do all the recording ourselves (generally on location), so
    it's not as simple as \"are you a label or are you a studio\". It's a bit of both.\r\n\r\n"

    I only really put that first one to demonstrate a simple idea. This label is a
    very small operation, so it's not for \"business\" reasons, as such. In other
    words - I'm not trying to go all corporate and re-brand the company. Just trying
    to decide if it's worth updating/redesigning the current logo. Also, there is
    no budget to hire a designer. I've done everything myself thus far and I have
