  body: "Is there any more to this 'font' than these letters? I am asking, because
    without any repeated letters  to prove this is a font, it may not be a font at
    all.\r\n\r\nThe two ID tools I used failed to find anything even close. This makes
    me start to think hand-drawn (not a font).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
