body: "I'm in need of a Greek font to pair with Hoefler's Mercury Text. I'm looking
  for a sans for this purpose. I've had a hard time turning up results. I've been
  using FontShop as one of my main sources, but, their recent redesign has been hateful
  to me. The site is barely usable, and not at all useful, especially looking for
  a Greek font.\r\n\r\nI apologize if this post is one of striking ignorance, but
  I am self-training and limited in the most important resources of any field, experience
  and understanding. Any direction is greatly appreciated, whether a font recommendation,
  a place to search more effectively, or a search term that will help me turn the
  needed results. \r\n\r\nThanks for helping,\r\nAdam"

    Greek language font, for use at text sizes.
