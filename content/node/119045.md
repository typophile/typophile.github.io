  a play by Friedrich Schiller. The book was printed by Verlag (publishing house)
  Philipp Reclam jun. Leipzig in 1970. The text typeface was called <em>Liberta Antiqua</em>.\r\n\r\nI
  am curious if there are digitizations of this typeface. Or, if not, which typeface
  would be a good approximation of it.\r\n\r\nThanks :-)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liberta-antiqua_3425.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you, <strong>Michel</strong>! Looks like I can download the font from
    e.g. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/trybuna/|myfonts.com]], though not directly
    through [[http://www.dtp-studio-unger.de/fontdesign.html|Ralph's website]]. Indeed,
    Trybuna looks <em>very</em> close to what's on that text page!\r\n\r\nThe only
    difference is in the German character \xDF which I like better in its \"original\"
    printed form :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trybuna-sz_6298.jpg]\r\n\r\nAccording
    to an email from Ralph: \"es ist einfach ein typographisches Update von mir, da
    sich die Originalform des \u201Esz\u201C nach der damaligen \u201EMode\u201C richtete.\"
    (That [the different \xDF] was a typographic update I made, because the original
    form of the \u201Esz\u201C conformed to the \u201Efashion\u201C of that time.)"
