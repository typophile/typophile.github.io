body: "I am currently creating my own arabic font (for personal use). So far I have
  created all glyph variants and ligatures. The next step before I move on to Microsoft
  VOLT is to create the diacratic marks. I have already created 1 glyph for each individual
  diacratic mark ('fatha', 'kasra', 'damma', etc.), but the problem is, the position
  of the glyph will depend on the letter it appears above (for example, the 'fatha'
  that appears on the letter 'alif' will be much higher than the 'fatha' that appears
  on the letter 'baa' and also more to the left). My question is, do I have to create
  a different glyph variant for each position of the diacratic mark, or is there some
  way to specify the position of the mark in Microsoft VOLT? \r\nIn other words, do
  I need 1 glyph of the diacratic mark 'fatha' (and can I then change the position
  in VOLT) or do I need to create a specific one for each letter?\r\nThanks\r\nI.

    the diacritics. I'm not familiar with the Microsoft VOLT software, but try opening
    an existing Arabic font in the editor and you should be able to see the characters
    and where they should go.\r\n\r\nI've been wanting to create an Arabic face for
    some time now. I'd be interested to see how yours progresses.\r\n\r\nTheodore"

  body: "You only need one glyph per mark. In VOLT, you set up the Mark Positioning
    <mark> and Mark-to-Mark <mkmk> features, using anchor attachment lookups. The
    trick is to position all your marks carefully in their own glyph space so that,
    for example, all above marks can be positioned on a letter using the same anchor
    attachment point. Within the VOLT glyph positioning window, you should lock the
    position of all second elements (marks), and then drag the marks into position
    above or below each letter, using the x and y offset values for the first element
    (base) to fine tune the positioning.\r\n\r\nMarks need to be classified as such
    in the VOLT glyph edit window (this sets their GDEF category).\r\n\r\nYour ligature
    substitution lookups should be set to ignore marks, so that the ligatures will
    form regardless of whether there is a mark on one or more of the letters. In the
    VOLT glyph edit window you need to identify ligatures as such and correctly record
    the number of components. So, for instance, the lam_alif ligature has two components.\r\n\r\nOnce
    this is done, in the glyph positioning window you can make a mark-to-ligature
    lookup, and position the marks independently for each component of the ligature.\r\n\r\nYou
    will find a lot of good information in the archives of the VOLT user community
    on MSN. You can also download the VOLT supplementary files, which include a model
    Arabic OT font that you can open in VOLT and examine."

      different mark for the letters of different widths and heights...\r\nWell, time
      to learn how to use VOLT.\r\nThanks for the info."
