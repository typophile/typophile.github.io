body: "I'm working on a multiple master font in FontLab Studio and noticed this button
  in the Font Info > Multiple Master settings panel:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PrimaryInstances_5039.png]\r\n\r\nI
  clicked on it and discovered that you can add named instances to a font. For example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PrimaryInstancesDialog_4101.png]\r\n\r\nI
  noticed right away that you can use this to select an instance to be used as the
  \"Default WeightVector\", which is somewhat useful since it controls the default
  glyph previews in the Font window.\r\n\r\nBut then I noticed something else: The
  Axis panel now has these instances listed in the pop-up menu near the top (which
  previously was disabled):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WeightVectorPopUp_3684.png]\r\n\r\nFantastic!
  Now I should be able to select the instance I want without having to remember and
  type in the number. Except that nothing happens. Selecting an instance from the
  pop-up has no effect on the axis slider. And typing in the value of an instance
  preset does not cause it to be checked in the pop-up either. The pop-up seems to
  do nothing except move the check mark to a different item.\r\n\r\nThere is one place
  where it seems to work, which is in the Generate Instance dialog:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GenerateInstance_5001.png]\r\n\r\nThat's
  good and very helpful. But what's the deal with the pop-up in the Axis panel? Is
  it broken? Unimplemented? Why is it even there if it doesn't do anything? Is there
  some trick to make it work? I've checked the manual and only found this:\r\n\r\n<em>The
  [instances] button allows you to quickly preview primary instances defined for the
  font on the Multiple Master Settings page of the Font Info dialog box. This button
  is disabled if no instances were defined.</em>\r\n\r\nSo, it does seem to be meant
  to do what I think it should do. Except it doesn't."

    doesn't work. (Version 5.0.4 Mac, build 2741)

  body: That may not work, but naming those instances really comes through when you
    use "Generate Instance".
