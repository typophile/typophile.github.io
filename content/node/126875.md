body: "The extension allows drawing letters with a centerline \u2013 skeleton. The
  stroke is literary drawn by a nib led according to a skeleton. Letterink advantage
  is the ability to vary nib width and angle on the same skeleton and keep those variations
  while changing general nib preset for a master. Moreover, the stroke is rendered
  into a glyph as if it was an outline. This allows the designer to use strokes without
  the direct necessity to expand strokes to outlines.\r\n\r\nExpanding to outlines
  generates clean vectors without messy points. Or, at least in most cases, it does
  so. The remaining cases are going to be fixed.\r\n\r\nCurrently, its possibility
  is narrowed to the simple pen simulated by abscissa. But, the results are more than
  promising.\r\n\r\nTry it here\r\nhttp://letterinkapp.com"

  body: "FontLab VI also has this capability, with the live Brush tool.\r\nI have
    enjoyed working with it, but I will caution that adjusting the weight live on
    a skeleton has some significant limitations, which are present on any existing
    tools I have seen so far.\r\nNotably, when increasing weight from a skeleton it
    is not ideal to add that weight equally on all sides. So for example, one wants
    to add about 2/3 or 3/5 of the increased weight on the outside of an H, less than
    half on the inside. Or with an O, it can differ from one design to the next as
    to what proportion of the added weight should be on the outside or the inside
    on the sides, and at the same time the top and bottom should only grow inwards."

    body: "Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nI have already heard about the problem, but haven't met
      it yet. For instance in real life: If I am writing with a stronger nib, I have
      to accordingly adjust hand trajectory. Same way, we need to adjust a shape of
      the skeleton. Maybe a better solution will be if the software could recalculate
      skeleton shape to suit the nib strength. What do you think?"

    body: Metapolator already does. However, Metafont is completely different algorhytm
      than Letterink.

  body: Ah yes, Metapolator does a nice job in that regard. And I am sure MetaFont
    does as well.
