		<div class="commentbody">Ivan, <BR>They are about the same.  I would look at both schools and make your choice on how they fit your educational plans.  Pittsburgh may be 20 minutes closer but that is hardly enough to make a choice on.  Carnegie Mellon is quite hard to get into.  You must have outstanding grades and SAT scores.  I have never heard anything about MICA so I can&#39;t say anything about it.  Maybe Dan can fill you in.  Also, check out there web sites and visit both schools.  You might also look at PCA in Philadelphia. <BR> <BR>Chris</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;From what I know, Carnegie Mellon isn&#39;t an art/design school, but rather a large University with a very good art/design department. The Maryland Institute is the oldest degree granting art school in the United States. For well over 100 years, though, it was just a regional college. Since the 1980s, it has also become a very good and competitive school on the national radar. They very much want to be the best art school in the country, and for things like painting, they might already be there. Design there is new. Just like graphic design isn&#39;t the most important major at Carnegie Mellon &#40;that would probably be Engineering</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Carnegie Mellon is a small university with about 5,000 students. Their long-standing design department grew out of the Bauhaus when designers left Germany because of growing resentment from political factions. Later, their was a strong Ulm influence with teachers like Marten Krampen and Gui Bonnsieppe.  This was followed by a strong Basel influence.  Their computer science department is ranked first in the country.  Perhaps this helped bolster the human interface interaction design which is quite strong at CMU. They also have a world-famous drama department. One of their graduates in Painting was Andy Warhol. <BR>CMU stresses high academic achievement and a very strong portfolio for entrance.  There is a great stress on communication problem solving to complement studio skills. CMU design graduates are expected to be analytical thinkers who use their studio/computer skills to facilitate the entire design process.  The class sizes are quite small and access to equipment is excellent. <BR> <BR>Take a drive and see both schools. That is the only way to see firsthand. <BR> <BR>Chris</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I went to CMU as well, and Chris L is right about CMU now. The Design School is quite good, but is much more focused on thinking and problem solving than it is on creativity and style. Depending on your personality/skills this could be a good or bad thing. There is a strong Swiss/International Style influence, particularly in the Basel-ish teaching methods of a few professors, but it doesn&#39;t completely subsume other schools of thought. CMU is great because it isn&#39;t strictly a design school, so you get exposed to excellent practioners from other fields. It&#39;s also very &#39;what you make it&#39;, so those who really strive to break out and initiate projects and programs can end up doing amazing things. Others will end up getting a good design education, but nothing truly remarkable. There was a leadership change a few years ago &#40;Dan Boyarski is the head now&#41;, so it may be less cerebral &#40;it got out of hand occasionally&#41; and more creative now. <BR> <BR>Grades are definitely a plus, but with the School of Design, it&#39;s all about aptitude and demonstrating an inquisitive and active mind, along with some creativity. I got into CMU on black and white work alone, but my portfolio was very organized, and demonstrated an eye for analysis and design foundations informing artistic decisions. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a great school and Pittsburgh is very underrated. If you want to know more, drop me an email. <BR> <BR>One of my coworkers, who&#39;s quite skilled, recommends Philadelphia University. It&#39;s not a design school, but it has a good design program. If you want a broader education with your design curriculum, it might be more of what you&#39;re looking for, and closer than CMU. That&#39;s about all I know. Oh, and Drexel is quite active with AIGA, but I don&#39;t know much about their program. <BR> <BR>PS: Dan, my only objection to your description of CMU is that of the Art Department. I saw very little at CMU that impressed me coming from the &#39;conceptually oriented&#39; Art Dept. Some may disagree.</div>
