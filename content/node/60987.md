body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a face which implements a joining behaviour
  using contextual alternates. However, problems can occur at boundaries if the '[[calt]]'
  feature is turned on for only part of a string, as illustrated below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AGIByzCaltSample_5250.gif]\r\n\r\nI've
  avoided this by including the following at the beginning of my 'calt' feature:\r\n\r\n
  \   sub A by A.calt;\r\n    sub B by B.calt;\r\n    <em> etc. </em>\r\n\r\nThe contextual
  rules then refer only to *.calt forms rather than the base glyphs from which they
  are derived.\r\n\r\nHere's the problem: I'd wanted to split my replacement rules
  into several distinct groups so the user could choose to apply some or all of them
  depending on how elaborate they wanted the joining to be. Unfortunately, if I do
  this I have to deal with more than a single type of boundary. For example, in the
  word 'affable', a user might apply 'ss01' to <em> affa, </em> 'ss02' to <em> fab,
  </em> 'ss03' to <em> fabl, </em> &c.\r\n\r\nWhile in principle, I could adopt a
  similar solution -- creating *.ss01, *.ss02, and *.ss03, in practice this simply
  isn't workable  -- when you consider that I'd have to duplicate not only the base
  glyphs (including all forms with diacritics), but also the contextual alternates
  created by every feature which applies before the feature in question, I suspect
  I'd run up against FontLab's glyph limit, not to mention the headaches involved
  in creating all those duplicates and debugging all the code which deals with them.\r\n\r\nI'm
  wondering if there is a simpler solution to this which I just haven't thought of.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Apparently no one has any thoughts on this matter.\r\n\r\nI've come up with
    a tentative solution which involves a set of 'clean-up' substitutions at the end
    of each of the relevant features, i.e.\r\n\r\nsub @hasnorightjoin @hasleftjoin'
    by @hasnoleftjoin;\r\nsub @hasrightjoin ' @hasnoleftjoin by @hasnorightjoin;\r\n\r\nThis
    seems unaesthetic to me though since it involves changes of the form X -> Y ->
    X and it also increases the size of the font's tables.\r\n\r\nSo as a follow-up
    question, should boundry issues of this sort be the font's responsibility or the
    application's responsibility?\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I did a quick check of several
    OT fonts with contextual alternates, and I couldn't see anything in their GSUB
    code which looked like it was there to deal with boundary issue (though admittedly
    I find it more difficult to follow other people's decompiled tables then to follow
    my own where I am familiar with the classes involved), suggesting that other designers
    may not be worried about this issue.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, InDesign (CS3)
    clearly passes the context to the font when applying the calt feature even if
    that context doesn't have calt active for it.\r\n\r\nIs there an 'official' position
    on this issue? \r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "I don't think users should be encouraged to apply stylistic sets in a piecemeal
    manner.\r\nIMO stylistic sets are to be used globally, e.g. in style sheets applied
    to paragraphs.\r\nThe \"calt\" feature is most certainly global, on by default.\r\n\r\nIf
    you provide a variety of stylistic sets which have different looks (e.g. degrees
    of complexity), then the user can try them out on a piece of text and see which
    looks best. They may even be applied cumulatively.\r\n\r\nIf users are really
    dissatisfied with the options available, then they can cherry-pick from the glyph
    palette, with no features applied.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with you regarding how stylistic sets should be used. It isn't my
    intention that users should apply the features to partial words, but I've become
    bogged down in the possibility that they <em> might </em>. So perhaps a better
    way of phrasing my question would be: \"how much effort should one employ in dealing
    gracefully with strange things the user might do?\"\r\n\r\nBTW in my earlier post
    I was fixating on features which created joining variants of characters, but of
    course final or initial variants are also possible, so it cannot be left up to
    the the application to simply ignore context which doesn't have the feature selected.
    Any attempts to deal gracefully with contextual features applied to partial words
    would have to be dealt with by the font rather than the application. But is it
    worth the effort?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
