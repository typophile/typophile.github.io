  body: Sorry, don't know any font that could match this "ALIEN". I don't even think
    it could be a font as it, more a customization of some (generic) sans. You could
    even start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/verdana/|Verdana]] (the
    one "MYSTERIES" is set in) and rework all finials as hook/harpoon/trident/claw.
    If you still need something in the same ballpark, having a look to the [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=402&text=ALIEN&fpp=50|Gothic
    > Moderne section at DaFont]] may worth a shot ([[http://www.dafont.com/unrealised.font?fpp=50&text=ALIEN|Unreleased]]...).

    Gothic?

    go to customization route: <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=ITC&ffam=ITC%20Serif%20Gothic%20-%20Regular&fid=c94f629ae662e045441d45b41eef0256&fsize=60&text=ALIEN&fit=1|ITC
