body: A colleague has converted a Hindi language brochure from PageMaker 6.5 to InDesign
  2. She opened the original .p65 file in ID2 to accomplish this. <BR> <BR>The document
  used a Hindi font called &#34;HindiSanskrit&#34;. The resulting converted document
  has little squares inserted between every few characters. If you select the squares
  they show as the HindiSandkrit. <BR> <BR>We have tested doing this on two machines
  that have the font installed. It happens on both. <BR> <BR>We have determined that
  these boxes are character spaces. What we need to do is make the boxes go away,
  and the space remain. Obvious replacements don&#39;t seem to work. <BR> <BR>Any
  insight would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Unfortunately, InDesign &#40;even the new CS version&#41; does not support
    any &#34;complex script&#34; languages, which includes Hindi and other Indic languages.
    As your colleague has discovered the hard way, they simply don&#39;t work. <BR>
    <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thomas, if I remember correctly the HindiSanskrit font is an ANSI hack font,
    which gives very basic Hindi shaping. I suspect the problem is simply in the conversion
    from a non-Unicode to a Unicode environment in which whatever code was being used
    as the space in the PageMaker file is not being correctly interpreted in InDesign.
    <BR> <BR>Jon, have you tried replacing the boxes with a space character in another
    font?

  body: 'Thanks guys.  <BR> <BR>John: We have tried replacing the character spaces
    with character spaces from another font in ID2 without success. Would  trying
    the same in PM work? Well, I&#39;m off to try it. <BR> <BR>Thomas: <i>...does
    not support any &#34;complex script&#34; languages...&#34;</i> It sure would be
    nice. Here in Vancouver the demands on the public library for multi language publications
    is high and continues to increase.'

  body: Although it lacks many of the fine typography features of InDesign and has
    a brutally unpleasant user interface, Microsoft Publisher &#40;Windows version&#41;
    has excellent complex script handling.

  body: 'Okay here&#39;s the scoop: <BR> <BR>My colleague experimented and found that
    replacing the character spaces with those from another font in PageMaker <b>before</b>
    opening in ID2 did the trick. <BR> <BR>John: Thanks for the note about Publisher.
    At least there&#39;s something. I wonder though with more and more OS level support
    for unicode and comlpex scripts in Windows, Mac OS X, and in Linux &#40;especially
    in desktop environments like GNOME&#41;, why more sofware just doesn&#39;t start
    with this capability out of the box... <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: In Adobe&#39;s case, the software relies less and less on operating system
    resources for things like text layout. The positive aspect of this is that it
    makes it much easier for Adobe to provide cross-platform exchangeability; the
    down side is that they are not able to take advantage of things like complex script
    handling offered by the OS, and need to develop these things themselves. Their
    development partners Winsoft, who produce the Middle East version of Adobe apps,
    have done a very good job implementing Arabic and Hebrew support. Nothing yet
    for Indic.
