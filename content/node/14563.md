body: "Just began constructing this typeface based on those really fast stars that
  you draw without your pen lifting off the page. just looking for some feedback on
  letterforms, which ones look odd or terrible and which ones seem to work better.
  This started off as a hairline font, but was curious if a 3D version would be worth
  the effort. \r\nThanks."
