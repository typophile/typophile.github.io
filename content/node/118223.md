body: "as a hobby i recreate original lp-covers for my music collection.\r\nso i do
  work with fonts and photoshop quite a bit.\r\nof course whatthefont and identifont
  are my prime source for font-recognition.\r\nunfortunately i have now come across
  a few 1960s albums that use rather rich fonts and automated identification just
  doesn't work with them.\r\nthat means i might have a number of requests in the next
  time - hope you all don't mind (also that i will keep myself shorter) and that good
  results will show just a quick as with the klemperer album from 2 days ago!\r\n\r\nthx
  in advance :)\r\n\r\nnr. 1 is a caballe album which seems to use a different font
  in every single line of the cover!\r\nas before i couldn't find a nicely scanned
  version.\r\nalbum is from '65 a.f.a.i.k.\r\n\r\n(hope image upload works seamless
  this time)\r\n\r\nedit: I've added 3 more pix of the missing 3 (sic!) fonts. I've
  come across a better photo of the cover and thought i could try providing better
  images. hope it helps.\r\nfont 1 is somewhere between cyan extrabold and trajanus.
  for the other 2 whatthefont was not getting any credible results.\r\nthx again"

    body: "*gee* ryuk - how do you do it?\r\n\r\nobviously the 'campanile' must have
      been a tough cookie being such a rare find.\r\nwith 'rubens' i kind of feel
      embarassed that i could not produce any results by whatthefont even though i
      had taken some time to 'respace' the letters in 111.jpg via PS.\r\n\r\nbonmot
      - when i started reading your answer, i was vexed for a moment and subsequently
      had a good laugh: at first i had thought you wanted to explain that montserrat's
      birth name was 'rubens'\u2026 well and of course in her case - as they say in
      latin \"nomen est omen\" *lol*\r\n\r\nany guess on the other two fonts?\r\nthey
      are to small and faint for automated recognition.\r\nthe first bares some resemblence
      to albertus but then again not (e.g. curved Y)\r\nthe second will not be easily
      distinguishable even in 1200*1200 res. so i am - against my usual habbit - inclined
      to cheat a bit, using something like american typewriter (quick guess) but there
      is something specific about the H - the interconnecting bar seems to have a
      curve\u2026\r\n\r\nany ideas?\r\ncheers!"

    may announce font 3 to be none other than LATIN bold condensed by wooden type
    fonts (the other digitizations don't have the v-shaped bar in the H)"
