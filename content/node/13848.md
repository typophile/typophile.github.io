body: "Hello! I need help typesetting chemical elements and equations. Should I always
  use small caps for chemical elements like oxygen (O), nytrogen (N), helium (He)
  and lithium (Li)? Or use small caps only when they appear inside paragraphs?\r\n\r\nFor
  example, the paragraph below would use small caps for letters \"l\", \"h\" and \"o\":\r\n\r\nLorem
  ipsum dolor sit amet, Li, O und He consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy
  nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n\r\nBut,
  when used in equations on separate lines of text no small caps would be used:\r\n\r\nO
  + O = O2\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    target="_blank">Here's one</a> (about the middle of the page treats with equations
    by themselves), and <a href="http://www.rbs0.com/tw.htm" target="_blank">here's
    another</a> (the Geological Society of America, which shows the equation terms
    within paragraphs).

  body: <a href="http://pontomidia.com.br/rafael/eg_chemical.gif">This image</a> gives
    a better idea of what I'm trying to do. On paragraphs I use small caps, but when
    elements appear on their own lines I don't. I'm not sure this is the right way
    to do it since I couldn't find anything that specific (chemical notation) in Bringhurst's
    book.

  body: "Since you appear to be working in Portuguese, I'm not sure the Chicago Manual
    of Style is relevant, but...\r\n\r\n(a) small caps are usualy reserved for acronyms,
    which chemical notations are NOT; and\r\n\r\n(b) when used within paragraphs,
    chemical and mathematical notations are treated in the same way as words from
    a foreign language, which means they appear in normal uppercase, but italicized.\r\n\r\nMethod
    (b) seems to me to be a better approach, if for no other reason than a small caps
    O (oxygen) might easily be confused for a lowercase o or, if you use oldstyle
    numbers, a zero, whereas an italicized uppercase O would always be recognized
    as such."

  body: Thank you! That's all I needed to know. For some time I've had the Chicago
    Manual of Style on my Amazon wishlist, I think it's time to buy it. It's really
    impressive (or depressive?) we don't have anything like it in portuguese; in Portugal
    maybe, but not in Brazil. Thanks again.
