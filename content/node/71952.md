  body: "It has been severely flattened/widened. One possible candidate/alternative
    is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/vekta-sans/\">Vekta Sans</a>,
    which has a shorted middle arm of the E, the same style G and a K that almost
    touches the stem.\r\n\r\nMy biggest reservation is whether the G is flat enough
    on the top and bottom, even with the distortion.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
