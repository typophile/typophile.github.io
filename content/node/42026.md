body: I'm looking to have a logo designed for my companies. It's becoming very difficult
  to find companies that do good work. Does anyone know where I can find a list of
  good companies or graphic designers that do good work and understand what goes into
  making a good logo?

    site won't win me friends, but....  why can't these brilliant print designers
    have usable websites?!   vanderbyldesign is the worst - it was painfully slow

    sample work.  \r\n\r\nHere endeth the off-topic rant."

    is doubtful of my work I send them to the site and that usually ends the discussion.

    membership but I''ll recommend them anyway. What about looking at Logo Lounge''s
    site, logolounge.com? That way you can pick a logo designer that''s compatible
    with what your looking for by first looking at the designs and not the credentials.  If
    you don''t want to pay for the membership, there''s always their book. But if
    your looking at books then, I''d say take a peek at Los Logos. It''s one of my
    favorites. '
