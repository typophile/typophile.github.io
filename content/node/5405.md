  body: 'Wow, thanks Dave. Lightning quick, as always... <BR> <BR>Not really what
    I wanted to hear though, because I&#39;m on a Windows box and thus have no access
    to Apple Chancery. Doesn&#39;t seem as if it can be bought anywhere, either. <BR>
    <BR>Is there perhaps a Windows version of Apple Chancery around somewhere? Or
    a really really close equivalent font &#40;as in: closer than Zapf Chancery&#41;?'

    &#40;hopefully I&#39;m not unwittingly supporting piracy -- it looks legit&#41;.
    There are conversion utilities out there to make Mac TT fonts usable on Windows.
    Check <a href="http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/conversion.html">Luc&#39;s page about
    it</a>. <BR> <BR>Unrelated: why is it that some people just routinely miss the
    &#34;Cheshire&#34; part of my name? I mean, for crap&#39;s sake, it comes first.
    Not a slam against you, Refusenik; it happens to a few other people. I just wonder
    why.'
