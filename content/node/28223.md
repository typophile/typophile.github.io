  Century Gothic as a display face for some web layouts I'm putting together and am
  having some real issues with the kerning in PhotoShop. It work's perectly well when
  I set the same copy in Illustrator or InDesign. have tried all the various setting
  in the Character palette that normally control this (optical, metric, 0 etc) and
  nothing seems to be helping.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of hundreds of pages I need
  to prepare in PhotoShop for this project so really don't want to have to individually
  track each title.\r\n\r\nAnyone come across this issue before."

  body: It looks like it was a glitch. I created another text box and it worked perfectly.
    Any clues to what might have caused it though? Was driving me mad for a little
    while there, and I've been designing websites in PhotoShop for 7 odd years ;-)

  body: All normal. The file has been shared and edited by a few users, so all I can
    think of is that one of those users had some weird setting or a messed up version
    of the Century installed?

  body: I had that setting selected and it was still looking like the image above.
    This is what was freaking me out. I think it was a bug, as once I retyped the
    copy it was fine.

  body: Oh! Weird. So at first typing it is wonky, but then you re-type it and it
    is fine? That smells like a bug to me.
