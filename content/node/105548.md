    Bold Condensed</a>, and similar fonts shown in the link have the same end of stoke
    wedge style.\r\nDynamo was designed by K. Sommer and released by Ludwig & Mayer
    in 1930.\r\nIn your image the style is applied to a square sans.\r\nIt could easily
    be recreated.\r\nHowever, there is still hope that someone will spot the font
    in the image.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
