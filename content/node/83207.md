  created in Hungary during the last century.\r\n\r\nA good source to see some Hungarian
  designs are these two sites:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.varkonyigallery.com\r\nhttp://www.plakatbolt.com\r\n\r\nThey
  are both my sites, I'm a Hungarian vintage poster dealer. However, my aim here is
  not to sell my posters, but rather to show the quality of Hungarian graphic designers
  (mainly in the 60s & 70s).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAdam"
