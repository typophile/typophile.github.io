body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm new here. I'm redesigning the 7th edition of my book
  How to Cheat in Photoshop, which is set in Rotis (yes, yes, yes, I know, but the
  first edition came out in 2001 and I haven't got around to changing it since).\r\n\r\nSo
  I looked around for a suitable caption/headline font - the captions are all sans
  - and wanted a spurless sans because it appeals to me. I'd just about settled on
  Daxline, which has the look I'm after, when I came across a discussion of it here
  (from 5 years ago) which mentioned Karbon.\r\n\r\nI've checked out Karbon, and I
  really like it. But I also like Daxline.\r\n\r\nI've made a mistake buying fonts
  before, ending up with poor letter and word spacing and no decent kerning pairs.
  Does anyone have hands-on experience of these two? Can you vouch for them? And,
  the tricky question: which should I choose?\r\n\r\nAlso - as a secondary matter
  - can anyone recommend a good serif font to go with them, for the longer pieces
  in the book?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "I'd be quite surprised to hear that either Daxline or Karbon\r\nset poorly
    - they're both from highly reputable font houses.\r\n\r\nOne advantage with Karbon
    is that its designer is alive (in\r\nfact he's impressively young :-) while Hans
    Reichel sadly\r\npassed away recently - the reasoning there is that if you\r\never
    need any modifications/extensions to the fonts you\r\ncould get them done by the
    original designer.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    confidence in his craftsmanship. So I think it''s just a question of which font
    you think will most suit the project and the look you want.  '

  body: "Good points, and thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nYes, I know Karbon was first
    aired here, and that's one reason why I posed the question here.\r\n\r\nThe trouble
    with fonts is that you can't try them out before you buy them, and I really need
    to see usage on the page before I'll know which is the right one. Ho hum - a difficult
    choice!"

    modifying this or that, fixing errors, setting a test page etc.

    Dax]]. \r\n\r\nIf you contact the foundry, I'm pretty sure they will be willing
    to set your text in the font, and send you a custom PDF."

    typefaces), usually he wouldn't allow us to change a single pair ;)\r\n\r\nFrode,
    I'm not sure if I understand what you allude to, but FontFont is certainly \xBBsmall
    and independent\xAB enough to fix any errors or provide custom samples settings.
    For modifications though, there is a charge."

    I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s an additional layer (of bureacrazy) between
    you and the designer. Foundries are often more cautious about potential pirate
    leaks, but many (some?) designers \u2014 if you\u2019ve establish a personal relation
    with them \u2014 are not afraid to create vector files, font files &tc for testing."
