  in relation to the paper and the spread. Famous typographers such as Jan Tschichold
  and Rosarivo devised canon's of page construction detailing how to calculate margins
  and set the typed area. \r\n\r\nHaving looked at over 100 books as part of some
  development work I am trying to complete, the most immediate and apparent observation
  is that most Publishers and obviously their book interior designers currently disregard
  such rules. My own feeling is that this is mostly done for monetary reasons. The
  books in my opinion still look very good and maybe is time to let medieval rules
  fall away.\r\n\r\nHere, is my question and I know it will not have any specific
  answer. What margin proportions and typed area settings do you think make a good
  modern book. Can you provide statistics from some books you like (paper size, top
  margin, bottom margin, left margin and right margin).\r\n\r\nSee also  [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/55502/modern-book-design-margins-and-typed-area|typed

    body: "Hrant thanks for your thoughts. There are numerous factors that affect
      the design of the page geometry, including the functional ones you mentioned
      to the apocryphal ones related to golden ratios. \r\n\r\nNormally one would
      start from the font size and the paper size, work out a reasonable length for
      readability and then apportion  the margins unequally to the outer and inner
      margins.  Now this has a lot of inherent variability as readability is somehow
      vacuous and the number of characters in a line can vary from 55-80. This also
      brings cost into the equation as well. \r\n\r\nThe bottom margin traditionally
      is made longer in order to hold the book at the bottom, although personally
      I always hold a book from its sides."

    two-page spreads and have gutters. Thus, traditional book design employed mirror
    symmetry and allowance for creep, neither of which need to considered in the design
    of a one-page-at-a-time ebook. The only real holdover is a larger margin at the
    bottom of the page, posited on the optical, rather than the geometric center of

    margin is required at the side, and even more at the bottom, in order to support
    the book adequately while being read.\r\nHowever, that\u2019s a static idealization,
    whereas in practice the merit of book-reading is that one may \uFB01dget, avoiding
    the unpleasant physical side-effects of catatonic pose. So it\u2019s no problem
    to hold the object where one isn\u2019t reading, after the manner of newspaper
    use. In fact, it could be argued that the newspaper format is responsible for
    undermining the traditional book proportions, entrenched as they had become over
    the centuries of its virtual monopoly."

    software also animates page turns to resemble a paper book page turn, which is
    goofy, I think. Fortunately the fake gutter can be turned off, and tapping the
    edge to turn pages rather than swiping makes the animation less pronounced. \r\n\r\nHere's
    a screen grab from iBooks with both the gutter effect and full justification switched
    off (you can click to view at full resolution):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://dstdenis.com/images/lacuna.png\"

    enable hyphenation, improving word spacing with full justification on or the right
    rag with justification off.\r\n\r\nWorking back towards the original topic, I
    hope that the introduction of additional software controls will improve e-book

  body: "Tschichold's canons of page construction are historically related to an era
    where books were mostly hard-covered and would open flat; therefore, one designer
    could easily set a tight interior margin (and large exterior margins) without
    the risk of getting the lines of text too close to the spine. Nowadays, when books
    are bound in paperback-like covers or, in the digital printing world, glued and
    milled, those margins proportions are harder to apply, althought Tschichold's
    micro-typography prescriptions (and the golden ratio book form proportion) are,
    in my opinion, still very useful.\r\n\r\nA common norm in designing a book page,
    anyway, is to set the bottom margin broader than the others; I would set the left
    and right margins with the same size and the upper margin just slightly smaller.
    This way, when the book is bound, you will have the impression that the golden
    ratio approach is somehow respected."

    they weren't quite \"Thou shalt not. . .\" but they did often come quite close
    to it. And no-one ever bothered to explain to us where they came from.\r\n\r\nWe
    were given margin ratios for \"de-luxe\", \"normal\" and \"economy\" margins.
    I forget them all but I think the \"normal\" was\u2014in the order of backs, heads,
    foredge, tails\u20141.5, 2, 3, 4. Economy was less than this and de-luxe considerably
    more of course. As has been pointed out, this assumes traditional case-binding.
    This gave a spread in which the backs taken together, were roughly equal to the
    foredge and the heads about half of the tails, which is more or less what jacobsievers
    indicates in his illustration.\r\n\r\nIt irritated me for years that publishers
    would use similar values for paperbacks, often resulting in the need to break
    the back of the book to get any kind of back margin at all. They do seem to be
    learning now however and it is far more usual than it used to be to see a generous
    back margin on paperbacks. Seems to have taken them a long time to learn though."
