body: "I have a very irregularly shaped, non-latin font, where I have to kern every
  letter pair. Let's say this font contains eleven letters. I have set the right margin
  of one letter \u2013 let's call it \"A\" \u2013 to 50 units. Then I kern that letter
  with the other ten letters, let's call them \"B\" to \"K\".\r\n\r\nAfter kerning,
  I realize that of the ten letter pairs, eight (\"B\" to \"I\") have a kerning of
  -10 units, one (\"J\") has a kerning of +10, and one (\"K\") has no kerning (i.e.
  0).\r\n\r\nMy font data now looks like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    A 50\r\n        B
  -10\r\n        C -10\r\n        D -10\r\n        E -10\r\n        F -10\r\n        G
  -10\r\n        H -10\r\n        I -10\r\n        J +10\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nTo simplify
  the kerning, I would like to change the right margin of letter \"A\" from 50 to
  40 units (50 - 10 = 40), the kerning of the eight letters from -10 to 0 (-10 + 10
  = 0), the kerning of \"J\" from 10 to 20 (10 + 10 = 20), and the kerning of \"K\"
  from 0 to 10 (0 + 10 = 10).\r\n\r\nMy font data should then look like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n
  \   A 40\r\n        J +20\r\n        k +10\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nwhich results in the
  same spaces between pairs as before (e.g. 50 - 10 = 40 - 0).\r\n\r\nNow, instead
  of going through the font and changing the margin and kerning manually, which is
  time consuming and error prone, I would like to do this programmatically.\r\n\r\nWhile
  I was thinking about writing a Python script that will read the kerning information
  from the font file into arrays and then loop through the arrays and calculate the
  new values, I am wondering if there is font software that allows this manipulation
  out of the box, or maybe there are scripts available online that do this manipulation,
  and I could save me a couple of hours of inventing the wheel a second time.\r\n\r\nDo
  you know of such solutions?"

  body: "I don't have an answer to your question, but in general reducing the number
    of kerning pairs by changing the left and/or right side bearings is not a good
    idea.\r\n\r\nIf your metrics are correct, don't change them. If they are not good,
    then correct them before starting with your kerning.\r\n\r\nAlso be aware in your
    example all other characters that are likely to pair with A should now include
    the additional 10 units as well, so:\r\nA +10\r\nL +10\r\nM +10\r\netc\r\n"

  body: "Thank you, erwindenissen. In my example the font does not contain any letters
    beyond \"K\", so there are no \"L\" or \"M\", but I get what you mean and will
    take care not to forget that.\r\n\r\nAs for \"correct metrics\", my font does
    not have regular letter shapes, so I cannot set, for example, the right side bearing
    to be the same for \"n\", \"h\" and \"m\". For better understanding, think of
    a symbol font where each glyph contains a unique form. Or hieroglyphs, where each
    glyph contains a different shape. I gave latin letters in my example only because
    you have them on your system, and I did not want to include images of my font."
