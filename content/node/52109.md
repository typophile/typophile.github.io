  that are available online?\r\n\r\nI've googled and haven't been able to find anything
  for well-known (or even reasonably well-known) companies. I'd love to find some
  for large Fortune 500 level companies, as well as some European ones, but most of
  what I've found are for universities or companies I've never heard of (I need examples
  for a project at work, and it would be more effective with well-known companies).\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Brands of the world has a collection of logos, but a corporate identity guide
    is much more than that. It specifies proper usage of the logo and other trademarks,
    including color, positioning, accompanying fonts if relevant, with illustrations
    of such, and also illustrations of erroneous uses that should be avoided.\r\n\r\nThis
    may include how the corporate identity is applied to signs, vehicle markings,
    packaging, stationery (including letterhead, envelopes, business cards, etc.),
    print, broadcast, and other media advertising, and other collateral.\r\n\r\nSuch
    a document can range from a small pamphlet to a collection of ponderous bound
    tomes depending on its scope.\r\n\r\nAs far as where to find a PDF of one, you'll
    probably have to ask the companies directly. Someone in the marketing department
    likely has access to this information to provide to advertising bureaus and the
    like, but they may regard the information as proprietary."

  body: There are actually a fair amount of them available online (I've found some
    decent ones (Diebold, BBC)), but the vast majority are for Universities and companies
    I know nothing about. I'd love to find some from larger european companies, but
    they may be proprietary or just too hard to find.
