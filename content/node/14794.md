  body: "There is a marked difference in the way that glyphs are described in TrueType
    and Type 1. \r\n\r\nIf you are going to be generating TTFs or TTF-flavoured OpenType
    fonts, you should convert your glyphs to TrueType curves, and also reverse the
    directions \u2014 Transformation / Reverse All / Set clockwise direction. \r\n\r\nIf
    you are going to be generating PST1s or CFF-flavoured OpenType fonts, you should
    convert your glyphs to Type 1 curves, and also reverse the directions \u2014 Transformation
    / Reverse All / Set counterclockwise direction. \r\n\r\nTransType should do this
    work for you, but I would get the files tight and clean in FL before using TrT,
    if that is your preferred generation tool."
