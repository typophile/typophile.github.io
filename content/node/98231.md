  across a new one\_\u2014\_the lower cased.  And just afterwards, a barred q for
  qua/cua. Now granted, I know that scribal abbreviations for such things are common,
  but I don't work with medieval texts where those are very common.  I certainly didn't
  expect to see it in a printed text from the 16th century.  The most I'm used to
  seeing is \xDF in italics and a good bit of n/m dropping via tilde.\r\n\r\nHow long
  did some of these abbreviations last out elsewhere?  Most of the facsimile editions
  I've used from Spain in the 16th century just have \xDF in italics, and a good bit
  of n/m dropping via tilde, and replacing que with q-tilde, hence my surprise with
  this one."
