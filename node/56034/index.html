  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have been looking at some actual Aldine italics and while they are really cool/fun/etc I don&rsquo;t know that I would actually want to use them along side a Aldine roman in a book. There is just too much going on in them.</p>
<p>See for example:</p>

<p>I should also add that I don&rsquo;t think I have to use something obviously Aldine of Arrighi in style. However as am I about the get down to designing my first italic for a roman that is Aldine in inspiration and it occured to me to ask you all what sort of italic in your experience  is a good partner with an Aldine roman. And actually - what you think is a poor match as well if you like.</p>
<p>I do know that there isn&rsquo;t one answer to this for a variety of reasons.  For instance : a good choice it will depend on how the italic is meant to be used - to set off a word or two or for longer passages. The other context is that I am interested in two contexts - screen use and for books.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I love Galliard. But Galliard Italic is so strong, that I can never use it.</p>
<p>So my vote is, whatever Galliard Italic ISN&rsquo;T. Not that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good design, it&rsquo;s just too overpowering to use the more subtle Roman alongside it. I wish the italic was more subdued.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Like Robert Slimbach, I opt for a restrained, somewhat orthodox style with the main body of the x-height based on the classic chancery script. Having done a bit of calligraphy, I&rsquo;m very comfortable with this approach; I can easily imagine making the strokes with a pen. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much wrong with the structure of Aldine italic, it&rsquo;s just a bit rough!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Think about it this way: the Aldine roman is ‘humanist book type v2.0’. First there was the beta release made by Schweynheim and Pannartz at Rome, then v1.0 which was Jenson&rsquo;s roman. By the time Aldus had his roman made, the style was relatively mature. The Aldine italics, on the other hand, range in quality from beta to 1.0, depending on the cut, and they are relatively immature compared to the romans. So I would look at the next generation of Italian cursive types &ndash; the 2.0 versions &ndash;; interestingly, these are the types that seem to have directly involved the input of writing masters like Arrighi and Alunno.</p>
<p>Ask Antonio if you can look at his Edizioni il Polifilo volumes if he has them with him in the UK. There are three books dedicated to 15th Century Italian cursives, and an essay on Alunno in <em>Scritti di Giovanni Mardersteig sulla storia dei caratteri e della tipografia.</em></p>
