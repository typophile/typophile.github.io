    of [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg4.html|this page]] in my Script
    Font ID Guide. My notes say it is available from severa free download sites.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Fivos, I honestly don't know if the original name is Riverside. All I know
    is that was the name of the font I used to make the sample for the Script Guide.
    It was obviously an amateur effort, in my opinion, because the spacing was terrible.
    That was the reason I had to adjust the tracking to get my sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Look what I found! Except for the A, the font [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hallmark/butch/reqular/?refby=bowfin|Butch
    HMK]], a Hallmark font, looks just like \"Riverside\". Interestingly, the design
    date is given as 2008, but my page for Riverside was made in 2004. Draw your own
    conclusions.  At least the Hallmark version is spaced better.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good find Mike ;)\r\nI performed a random test by choosing another Hallmark
    font (Fultoon HMK): \r\nMyFonts.com reports a design date of 2010 but I have found
    the same font with a (c) of 1999, so I suppose the design dates reported on MyFonts.com
    for Hallmark are not accurate."
