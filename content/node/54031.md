  body: Actually it would be Egizio, by Aldo Novarese. Belizio is an extended digital
    version of Egizio.

  body: "I think this is probably Belizio. The weights of Egizio (from Scangraphic
    and URW) available from Fontshop and MyFonts don't match the sample, while Belizio
    Medium does.\r\n\r\nFont Bureau makes it plain that Belizio is a revival of Egizio,
    so it's less of a question of authenticity and more a question of the provenance
    of the font that produced this sample."

  body: Yes, of course I was just talking about the design. The digital version is
    very likely to be Belizio, since Egizio does not seem to have so much digital
    versions, and the Font Bureau's is surely a lot better than the average.
