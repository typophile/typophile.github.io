  [[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chouinard/the-ink-dial|my printing-related
  Kickstarter]] a look-see. (You can also find it inkdial.com as well.)\r\n \r\nI\u2019m
  not sure what any typographers would do with a tool to measure printing ink, but
  I think the rewards are particularly interesting. Perhaps some of you are friends,
  fans, colleagues, even collectors of the amazing artists who\u2019ve graciously
  donated work for me to print in limited editions for kickback. \r\n\r\nSpeaking
  of whom, check out some of the amazing artists who\u2019ll be making prints:\r\n<!--break-->\r\n1.

    is yet; haven't the resources to file any protective paperwork on the idea yet.
    Ergo, the Kickstarter. \r\n\r\nBut MAN!!! Look at that list of artists!!!\r\n"

    good price on having their work nicely printed in letterpress, with some publicity
    to boot.\r\nWhat have they got to lose?\r\nEither their artwork already exists,
    or they won't create it unless you raise the requisite funds.\r\nThe real faith
    is being exercised by those not on your artist list, who pledge funds for their
    rewards, sight unseen.\r\nIt might help your project if you could persuade one
    or two of the artists to produce poster art specifically for this project, and
    show these rewards now. That would appeal to those who are interested in exclusive
    art prints.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I don't think it's a good idea to mention Ink Dial
    if you don't already have patent and trademark protection in place.\r\n\r\nI would
    imagine that commercial paint manufacturers (eg Behr) use something similar to
    \"dial up\" colors, adding pigments to a neutral base.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit
    to non-printers: it's a green product in that it reduces ink wastage."

  body: "Thank you Nick. You make many good points.\r\n\r\nA few of the artists really
    wanted to be involved but they could only offer me work they'd already created.
    Others, most in fact, are creating original work for this project. Quickly off
    the top of my head I know Sumner Stone, Marian Bantjes & Susan Skarsgard are all
    in the process of creating original work.\r\n\r\nI understand and share your trepidation
    about patent & trademark concerns. I am failing to post a trademark symbol after
    the words Ink Dial\u2122. This I understand grants me a measure of protection
    until the paperwork has cleared. Kickstarter made it clear that no one will pledge
    unless they can see the thing. On the other hand, what counsel I've received from
    patent attorneys is clear: I'd be a fool to utter one word about this until I
    am ready to take orders & ship product. I am erring on the side of caution as
    best I can. WIthout the Kickstarter I have no other means to afford the protective
    paperwork.\r\n\r\nThe idea was inspired years ago by standing in line waiting
    for my paint to be mixed at the hardware store. There exist large computer-operated
    ink distribution systems for massive offset presses, but my tool is intended for
    \"micro-use\" I call it. It not only reduces the waste of mixing too much ink
    but solves other ink maintenance problems.\r\n\r\nMy gratitude knows no end. I
    thank the artists with every correspondence and I thank those of you who've pledged
    already cleaning 20% of my goal within the first week.\r\n\r\nThanks again Nick.
    Discussion is just one of many ways to spread the word."

    community). No sense in venturing into the unknown unless you have a piece of
    unknown work  :-) Counterproductive, now isn't it?\r\n\r\nAnd actually Nick, I
    was not looking for publicity, did not not even enter my mind. Terry seems like
    a great, inventive and generally good fellow, he was introduced to me by Susan
    Skarsgard. The list of participants that I know are just genuinely good and giving
    people. Seems to me that everybody on the list, that I know... most of them, are
    established enough to not worry about the face time.\r\n\r\nAs the \"invention\"
    was described to me it sounds very useful and creative!"

    when he asked you to contribute?\r\n\r\n(BTW, I would never call any artist \"amazing\",
    but some of your artworks are quite awesome, IMHO!)"

    of us are very complex designers, some of us adore simplicity and there are others
    falling everywhere in between.\r\n\r\nPlus Terry's pedigree is flawless.   :-)\r\n\r\nAnd
    thank you for your comments Nick, sent a chill up my spine."
