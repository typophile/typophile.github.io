body: I did some custom type work for the flag of my school's newspaper; because of
  the bad paper and the lackluster print quality, I decided to play up the imperfection
  of the medium by creating rounded and uneven letterforms. I tried to make it look
  as if the ink was bleeding into the paper substantially, and I was happy with the
  final result in the newspaper. I'm now thinking of turning it into a typeface, but
  I'm worried that the imperfections aren't going to scale well. What should I keep
  in mind to keep the low-fidelity feel without making it repetitive and contrived?
  I've attached an R and a U. I'm aware there's a bit of cleaning up the lines to
  be done around the corners, but the uneven shape of the U is intentional.

  body: I'm just focusing on getting an uppercase alphabet done for now, maybe with
    a bit of punctuation and some accents. I feel like distressing an alphabet is
    best done in photoshop in the final product, so that you don't have to deal with
    the same letter having faults in the same place on every letter.

    body: What kind of opentype code? Just adding automatic 'ligatures' for different
      pairs of letters containing different variants, or is there something more refined
      that I can make use of?
