- body: Too busy, too cliche, and kerned too tightly. Why so many colors? Why does
    the tagline proclaim "freedom from coffee and copies" yet the mark looks like
    four copies of a coffee cup?

    to\" have achromatic/nonvivid type. Otherwise it looks kitchy. White trash.\r\n\r\nPutting
    aside all resemblances to other logos and suggestions about improper type use.
    I agree with all of them above.\r\n\r\nOh. Bahamas is a good example of what I
    just pointed out. Achromatic/Nonvivid type against colourful logo. Check others
    as well like [[http://www.nbc.com|NBC]], [[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/|MS
    Windows]], [[http://www.bt.co.uk|BT]], various Olympic logos...\r\n\r\nOf course
    there may be exceptions to the rule... but you have to know exactly what you're
    doing and what you want to achieve...\r\n\r\n@epsilicon: my thoughts exactly.

  body: imo, a mark shouldn't be used unless it represents something effectively.
    Maybe you can play with the type instead. If you still want to go with the mark
    you are using i have an idea. You could make them into cubes, representing cubicles.
    But, you can make the bottom right one colored or seperated vs. the others being
    black or together. That would represent it being "free" imo.

  body: "This person is back. \r\n\r\nNo. This is not my logo. \r\n\r\nThis logo was
    designed by a crowdsourced company, Crowdspring. \r\n\r\nI was initially approached
    about the logo (we're a small company, we're offering $500, yadda yadda) and not
    having time, I passed the project to a qualified intern. I am not exactly sure
    what happened, whether he spoke to my intern or not, but the guy decided to crowdsource
    the logo, eventually turning to Crowdspring. He's now singing its praises, and
    in passing made some disparaging comments about the design field in general. \r\n\r\nI
    decided to crowdsource critiques from various online message boards (besides design
    boards) for his logo. \r\n\r\n"
