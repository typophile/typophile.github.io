<p>They&rsquo;re interchangeable until you need to make a distinction. In practice, this means that for the typical user, they are interchangeable, while for type professionals they are more like to be used in a more precise and differentiated way. I need to be able to distinguish between a design and an implementation of that design in a particular technology. As you say, the word ‘fount’ has been around for a long time, but it has always referred specifically to a particular implementation of a typeface: formerly a tray of metal type at a particular size &ndash; e.g. ‘a 10pt font of Times New Roman’ &ndash;, then to a set of Linotype matrices or a Monotype matrix case, then to a variety of glass and film negatives or positives, and most recently to software.</p>

<p>It just so happens that most digital typefaces are designed for one font size, say, 12pt for text, 18pt for display. The fact that we scale them to whatever we want doesn&rsquo;t mean that it isn&rsquo;t one cut, or font. Each different weight is a different cut, or font. Each style is a different cut or font. The size isn&rsquo;t specified any more, but it is implied, even though we ignore it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>megax:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very simply put: A typeface is a set of one or more fonts.
Typeface = Parent;
Font = Child;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Nope, that doesn&rsquo;t work, because a ‘set of fonts’ may also imply a typeface family, which consists of more than one typeface, e.g. Time Roman, Times Italic, Times Bold, etc., all of which are separate typefaces. The best way to understand the distinction between typeface and font is not to try to define a relationship between the two &ndash; e.g. parent and child &ndash;, but to realise that the distinction is meaningful precisely because the relationship is multivalent. And it is multivalent because of the variety of font technologies and how those technologies embody typefaces. For instance, a single typeface might be embodied in a single font (typically the case for OT fonts), but it might also be embodied in muliple fonts (as was the case with many typefaces in Type 1 format, requiring separate fonts for ligatures etc.), or multiple typefaces might be embodied in a single font (as is the case with individual Asian fonts containing both roman and italic Latin companions).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry, Don, but there has been consistent use of the term typeface in a way that distinguishes between major styles, weights and widths. Historically, the reason for this is obvious, because the idea of marketing e.g. roman and italic typefaces under a single name is a relatively recent phenomenon. Even as late as the 1930s, Eric Gill conceived his roman (Perpetua) and italic (Felicity) under separate names. It is also worth noting that some typefaces were independently conceived and only later, and sometimes erroneously, associated, e.g. the pairings of Garamond romans with Granjon italics.</p>
<p>We have a separate term &ndash; typeface family &ndash; to refer to a collection of separate-but-related typefaces under a single name.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>They must be typefaces, Nick, for we often see colophons that tell us books have been set in &ldquo;Bodoni&rdquo; or &ldquo;Garamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But maybe there is more than one kind of Garamond, for sometimes we see colophons that tell us a book has been set in &ldquo;A Garamond.&rdquo; This leads me to believe there must be more than one type named Garamond, but I still don&rsquo;t know which of those possible Garamonds. This is all very confusing.</p>
<p>Still more confusing are some of the other (often strange) words appended to typeface names. I see colophons that mention &ldquo;ITC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Monotype&rdquo; or &ldquo;Linotype&rdquo; Baskerville, for instance. And what is this &ldquo;Adobe&rdquo; I see with typefaces names? Is that stuff not mud and straw and ox blood?</p>

<p>But what I tell my students is the metal type definition (see above) and then relate that &lsquo;font&rsquo; is a cool sounding word that we now apply to the whole thing.</p>
<p>I even know someone who will refer to the plural, fonts, as font. Like: &ldquo;I use a lot of font.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have the heart to correct her. Anymore. She wasn&rsquo;t listening. Hell, it might catch on eventually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make font.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use font.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Font: gooood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I point out: right now there really is no master committee that oversees all this, so like the English language, &ldquo;font&rdquo; is now a funky term that everyone knows, is used to sell a product; but at this point, who knows what it really, really is &hellip; today.</p>
<p>(if we actually knew, there wouldn&rsquo;t be so many posts on this page)</p>

<p>Like the term &lsquo;leading&rsquo;, &lsquo;typeface&rsquo; and &lsquo;font&rsquo; evoke the metal era.</p>
<p>A typeface was what was cut by the punchcutter, and a font or &lsquo;fount&rsquo; was what was poured by the foundry. What was cut made up a cohesive set, and what was poured filled an order. In other words, the font was the deliverable, but what&rsquo;s on the face of the deliverable is what was categorized and named.</p>
<p>Punchcutters cut <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> representatives of conventional or iconic letterforms. Hence the term &lsquo;type.&rsquo; They cut them more or less according to a pattern, and as a set. The typeface is the &lsquo;cut set&rsquo; originating in a specific time and place. It can be added to at a later date.</p>
<p>The cut set could include an italic and small caps. So that typeface encapsulates a roman, an italic and small caps. Another typeface might not. The italic, roman and small caps would be deliverable as separate fonts.</p>
<p>In the digital era a font became a deliverable item in a font-suitcase, and a typeface became what is digitally &lsquo;graphed.&rsquo; As a design, for instance, the typeface univers has many weights and widths, as well as obliques; a full font suitcase contains a document for each of these. Some users will have univers but only as a selection of these fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well said enne_son, it&rsquo;s nice to know that not everyone has forgotten what type really used to be.</p>
<p>In my letterpress classes (and by my old-school design adviser) we were taught that a typeface is Helvetica and a font is Helvetica Bold (or italic, or whatever) and that point size usually didn&rsquo;t figure into the nomenclature, but I think that is mostly due to the digital age where point size is easily changed, and isn&rsquo;t a matter of going and finding the 35 pound drawer of type in a different size. I think all graphic designers should be required to take a letterpress class. It&rsquo;s one thing to say you get what leading is, it&rsquo;s another to hold a 10pt. lead in your hand and find out first hand why capital letters get called &ldquo;upper case&rdquo; and to smell the ink and&hellip; I&rsquo;m getting all sentimental here.</p>
<p>Next all of us young designers can take a compositing class and find out why the white space around your InDesign document is called the pasteboard&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here&rsquo;s an OLD GUY checking in, phrostbyte.</p>
<p>When I was a young guy, daily working in letterpress book printing shops and in a Monotype house a &ldquo;font&rdquo; was a wrapped-up package of, say, 12-point Garamont. Another font would contain 12-point Garamont italic. Another would have 12-point Garamont small caps. Three other fonts would have those same typefaces, but in 11-point. And so forth.</p>
<p>The typeface was Garamont or Garamont italic or Garamont small caps. I disagree with enne_son that a typeface &ldquo;encapsulates&rdquo; roman, ital, and smalls. To the compositor on the floor, assembling a book or an ad, or to the guy who ties and wraps the fonts, the roman, the ital, and the smalls are different typefaces.</p>
<p>Yet it is indeed possible to speak of Garamont as a typeface in a more general sense, as in &ldquo;That beautiful book is set in Garamont.&rdquo; A more thorough description of the book might note that three typefaces (rom, ital, and smalls) had been used, each in several sizes.</p>
<p>Nowadays, sitting in front of a computer, a font is the digital data that allows me to see a typeface on a screen or to allow that typeface to be printed on paper. MyFonts describes LTC Garamont as &ldquo;a font family of 12 fonts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The typeface is what I see on that screen or on that sheet of paper or on a tee shirt, etc.</p>
<p>B U T :  This may be an issue on which we must agree to disagree. Just in this short thread there are quite a few differences between font and typeface, based on good thought and experience. And then there is the wider world&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;font&rdquo; to describe everything from printed typefaces to the words &ldquo;I love Cheryl&rdquo; scratched in the oceanside sand with a pointed stick.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Will, I said: &ldquo;The cut set could include an italic and small caps. So <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  typeface encapsulates a roman, an italic and small caps [my emphasis; gloss: meaning that particular]. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another typeface might not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> [emphasis added]&rdquo; I think &lsquo;typeface&rsquo; is a plastic term &ndash; it had and has an elastic use. I like to tie it to a deliberately cohesive set of punches cut at a particular time and place.</p>
<p>I suppose my post was as much a proposal as a description of actual or conventional use. ITC Garamond Italic can be the italic sorts in the ITC Garamond face. An added complication of course is that garamond became a generic name for a class of typefaces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mark: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Words derive meaning from the way they are used, not from what people say they mean (or should mean).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Undeniably true, although the implications of this statement are often ignored of seldom thought-through. One implication derives from the observation that the same word is used in different ways by different people: meaning, while seldom idiosyncratic, varies among different communities. Another implication is that people saying ‘what words mean (or should mean)’ are in fact reporting either how they use those words or how they think those words should be used.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my first post in this discussion, I agree that font and typeface are interchangeable terms for a great many people, largely metonymic in common use. But I&rsquo;m a professional type designer and font developer, and I use the terms distinctively in a way that is meaningful, i.e. useful, within the context of my work. And I&rsquo;m not about to abandon that distinctive use, because I need to be able to talk precisely with others in my professional community, so a usage that conflates or confuses the two terms is not useful to me.</p>
<p>Thomas, I hope the written results of your poll will pay due attention to varying use in different communities. It is often the case that a more precise use of terminology exists within a minority community or subculture, whereas a less precise use prevails in the larger populace. But it is also the case that this usually implies a greater importance of the terminology among the minority, who have particular reasons to desire greater precision.</p>
