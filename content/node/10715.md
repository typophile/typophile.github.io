  body: 'My general feeling about it is that it&#39;s too restrained. On the other
    hand, I don&#39;t know what effect a router has on wood, so I don&#39;t know how
    faithful a rendering this is. A few specific responses, though: <BR> <BR>1. The
    widths aren&#39;t quite consistent. The B, H, and X should be wider; the S should
    be narrower. <BR> <BR>2. It looks like the J and L baselines are lower than the
    rest. I wouldn&#39;t mind if the font overall had more wildness, but if you&#39;re
    going to keep going this direction, I think the baselines should pretty much line
    up. <BR> <BR>3. The 1 looks off compared to the rest of the numerals, plus I think
    it should be distinguished more from the I. <BR> <BR>4. I appreciate the variation
    in the punctuation, but again, that seems more indicative of a less-restrained
    font. I think you either need to make them more consistent both with each other
    and the rest of the font, or you need to let the other characters in the font
    have more individuality. <BR> <BR>5. If you plan on releasing this, you should
    start thinking about another name for it; House already has a font called <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=GENCOL-FO&amp;sub=view">Treehouse</a>.'

  body: I am a student and this was the first attempt at a font.  The baseline shift
    on the L and J is intentional.  I think because the detail is not here that it
    does feel like it doesn&#39;t work. The consistency not being the same is also
    intentional.  I agree on your comment about the one looking off I will work on
    that.  I will also be posting larger views of the font so the detail can be seen
    and it may make more sense. <BR> <BR>thanks
