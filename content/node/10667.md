body: Does any have a sample non-disclosure statement  to be used as some kind of
  assurance that you can safely submit your designs for consideration to foundrys?
  <BR> <BR>It is to be used  preceding your design submission in an effort to protect
  your designs from unauthorized copying. <BR> <BR>This protection is essential whenever
  you <BR>submit your original work for review to anyone. <BR> <BR>An example would
  help everyone out I am sure. <BR> <BR>-smc <BR> <BR>

  body: 'I don&#39;t have an NDA that is specific to submission of designs to a foundry,
    but I have uploaded a PDF of our standard, mutual <a href="http://www.tiro.com/transfer/TiroNDA.pdf">NDA</a>.
    This is the agreement we use when people are doing work for us, particularly if
    it involves clients that require NDAs between all parties. It is a good boilerplate
    NDA, and will give you some idea of the kind of things that you need to specify
    in any such agreement. <i>NB: you should have any legal agreement reviewed by
    a lawyer in your own jurisdiction &#40;or that of the counter-signing party&#41;.</i>
    Note also that you should exchange two copies for signing, one to keep in your
    own records and one for the other party to keep. Do not disclose any confidential
    information to the other party until you have a counter-signed copy of the agreement.  <BR>  <BR>If
    drafting an agreement specifically to cover submission of a design to a foundry,
    you might also want to include explicit prohibition against derivative works,
    although this is implicitly covered in the prohibition against &#39;disclosing,
    reproducing, summarising and/or distributing  <BR>Confidential Information&#39;
    and by the assertion that &#39;the Disclosing Party does not grant any express
    or implied rights to the Receiving Party.&#39; <BR> <BR>[Note that I&#39;ve disabled
    printing of this PDF, but you can copy and paste the text.]'

  body: Thanks John. <BR> <BR>Anything else out there?  <BR>Anyone ever used one before
    you sent your design? <BR> <BR>P22 mentions one in their submission guidelines
    up front and say they would be happy to sign one. <BR> <BR>-sm

  body: "I\u2019m not convinced that an NDA, in the way I understand them, is super
    helpful here. Say you sign an NDA with a foundry, send them your fonts, you exchange
    some emails but at the end of the day they say they\u2019re not interested, or
    you can\u2019t agree to terms. Later they come out with a design eerily similar
    to your design. In signing an NDA you can\u2019t disclose the communications you
    had with them without being in breach of the NDA yourself. And as it\u2019s notoriously
    difficult to prove cloning you might find yourself on the wrong end of the law.
    Maybe."

  body: "What Simon said.\r\nThe only thing that might work is depositing your design
    with a neutral third-party in advance, and if they copy your idea you can shame
    them after the fact (on Typophile). You might even tell the foundry you've done
    this (although I imagine it might scare them off). Say it's not personal - it's
    your \"standard protocol\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "\r\nA cheap way to \u2018deposit\u2019 your design is to print it on a piece
    of paper, fold that in such a way that the design is obscured, tape it shut, write
    your name and address on it, slap a stamp on it and and drop it in a mailbox.
    \r\n\r\nJust do not forget to NOT open it when it arrives on your doorstep and
    keep it in a safe place.\r\n\r\n(BTW In the Netherlands it used to be possible
    to go to a Tax Office and have a design time-stamped)"
