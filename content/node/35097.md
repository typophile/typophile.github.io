  a nice surprise to see such carefully chosen type, very much of it in the old style(s),
  in a movie. Newspapers, signs, closing credits - everything throughout the film
  - ughh. It was like porno for typos.\r\n\r\nFilm is a medium with which I have not
  seen type treated with this kind of attention (credits excluded - there are many
  wonderful examples of beautifully set credits!). Does anyone have any favorite type-showcasing
  films? Please share your experiences.\r\n\r\nFeel free to include any documentaries
  about type, too, I guess. Many of us are familiar with the the Helv documentary
  (maybe even seething to see it), but I suspect there may be more out there.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nBest,\r\nRay\r\n\r\nP.S.
  By the way (and my intention is not to turn this into a HP thread), but even beyond
  the type treats, HP5 is a fantastic film..."

    still at senior school at the time, 15 maybe.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember this story
    breaking about the use of historical type in period films, specifically helvetica

    for now, at least... Tomato have done some excellent work in film, Trainspotting
    being the first that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nBut films and typography, my two all-consuming
    passions, rarely seem to cross paths...\r\n\r\nAnthony"

  body: "I was going to post about this after I caught OotP, but for some reason I
    didn't.\r\n\r\nThe movie really did have a lot of sick type stuff to offer. Between
    the main transitions that were done in 3d animated, 2d pages from the Daily Prophet,
    to the typographic riot that were Umbridge's decrees, someone was really earning
    their paycheck.  Too bad I can't find any screenshots of the Prophet's sleek new
    redesign. In all the previous films, the main heads were done in wizard-anachronistic
    blackletter, but in the latest outing, most of it was done in a weathered, black,
    condensed sans (though the text still looked like a gnarly blackletter). It's
    too bad they omitted all the stuff about the Quibbler \u2013 I'd have been interested
    to see how it would look compared to the Prophet.\r\n\r\nConcerning other films,
    for some reason the ubiquity of Gill Sans in near-future London in Children of
    Men struck me as a nice touch. The director, Alfonso Caur\xF3n, was also behind
    Azkaban, with it's sweet Marauder's Map, incidentally.  \r\n  "
