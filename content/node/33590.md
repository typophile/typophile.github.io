body: "Dear Typophiles Logo Critique contingent\r\n\r\nI'm writing to hear your feedback
  on my institution's new logo. I know I ought to tell you all as much about the project
  as possible, but I'd rather fill in the audience, occasion, purpose, etc. later
  after you chew on it a while. I would like to share the marketing consultant's rationale
  with you though. [I should state that this W logo is placed symmetrically above
  the name of the institution in Bembo, title case to be a bit more descriptive.]\r\n\r\nThe
  new symbol for the College combines a stylized \u201CW\u201D with the full name
  of the college.\r\n \r\nEach element of the logo has meaning. In the \u201CW\u201D
  graphic, the particular typeface selected is Bembo, a classic, serif font that honors
  the history of the college. Where the central diagonal strokes of the W cross, a
  break has been created. Conversely, the serifs at the top of the letterform that
  would normally be distinct have been joined. This speaks to our community \u2013
  one whole made of inter-connected, individual parts. Although the total construct
  \u2013 the W and the name \u2013 appear at first glance to be centered and symmetrical,
  they are not in fact. This suggests that the (institution's name) experience is
  characterized by surprise and non-conformity.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts anyone?\r\n"
