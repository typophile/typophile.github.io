body: "I'm having trouble determining what this typeface is... it's obviously not
  very well set (the kerning is quite bad) but its from a film project I'm working
  on doing a poster for and wanted to ATTEMPT to match the typeface (just so I have
  at least one mockup with the original face)\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/exK"

  body: It's extremely <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-bookman/">Bookman</a>-like,
    but the <em>e</em> is not quite right, and a few other details don't line up.
    Maybe an uncommon cut? Anyone?
