body: "I've taken over the job of typesetting an online academic journal. Past papers
  were set in the version of Goudy Oldstyle from Adobe. I was thinking of upgrading
  to the Lanston Type Collection (P22) version of this typeface, in part because it
  contains a more complete glyph set (e.g., it includes a full complement of superscript
  figures).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI've never used any LTC fonts, though, and I wanted
  to get some input before investing in one of them. Are they generally regarded as
  well-made and well-produced fonts?\r\n\r\nI was also wondering whether switching
  to the LTC version will create a noticeably different look for the journal. I know
  that there will be subtle differences between the two versions, but I want to preserve
  a sense of continuity. That is, I don't want it to be obvious to readers that I've
  switched fonts. Does anyone know how different the two versions are? (I can't think
  of a good way to test this without buying the LTC fonts.)\r\n\r\nI'm just an amateur,
  and any input from more experienced typophiles would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nMatty\r\n"

    info and see if they will let you try out the fonts. not saying this always works
    (as a general rule), but some say it can."

    it is the LTC version that includes the longer descenders, right?"

  body: I have LTC Deepdene (like LTC Goudy, now owned by P22) and it has quite a
    few glitches in the outlines that I would not expect in a professionally produced
    font. If I were buying an LTC font again, I would demand the foundry allow me
    to test it first.
