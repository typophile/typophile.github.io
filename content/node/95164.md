  anyone like to share your helpful hints or tips on achieving this look (see image
  attached). Notice how the letter N has a nice subtle texture or rough treatment
  to it? \u2013I have used different (amateurish) ways of achieving this look but
  I've never really been confident with the outcome. I either make the letters look
  too overly rough or not rough enough. I find myself to be a bit tenacious when adding
  texture of this sort to type. \r\n\r\nAny of your suggestions or advice would be
  most welcomed and appreciated.\r\n\r\n-kat\r\n"

  body: We (at work) set the type normally, and then use a .tiff distress file, made
    in Photoshop, over it. You can change the colour of the .tiff in Illustrator,
    you can create exactly the amount of distress you need, vary it across the letters,
    and most importantly, this is a case where a good distress will be much smaller
    in raster than in vector. A vector distress that gives good texture can be overwhelming
    to a printing rip.

  body: "BeauW's suggestion is the best. One can even do this in InDesign; place a
    structure (psd or tif) over a piece of text and go wild with the Effects-settings.
    The structure can be scaled to make more subtle or rougher effects. \r\n\r\nA
    small library of structures will go far. Nice starting point: print a solid black
    on a laserprinter. Crunch the paper multiple times, copy on laser copier, repeat
    as many times as wanted. Scan in high resolution."

    the rage.

    have almost 1,500 video tutorials on graphic design subjects, and the instructors
    are design professionals. There's a monthly fee to subscribe, but they have free
    sample videos, and sometimes via Google you can find codes for a free month or
    at least a discount.\r\n"
