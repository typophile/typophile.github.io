  body: Both look like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica|Helvetica
    Neue]] to me, Extended for "nicholson" and and UltraLight or Thin for the text.

    really see Helvetica everywhere recently... If it appears to be true, I really
    need to consult an ophthalmologist :D"

  body: "But it also has features (like the gently modulated tops of the arch-stem
    joins) that very few -legitimate- free fonts enjoy. In fact the \"c\" (and to
    a lesser extent the \"o\") is the only really malformed glyph. The \"s\" -a very
    difficult letter to make well- is tellingly clean, it's just horizontally stretched.\r\n\r\nSo
    my guess is it's either a one-off logo based on a mainstream font, or yet another
    plagiarized/butchered free font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
