  looking at all the original logotypes and custom lettering. So much so that I felt
  like dusting off an old project. <BR> <BR>The loose name for the face is Shard.
  It is not done yet, and it needs Caps. I thought I&#39;d turn to the online type
  community for inspiration. <BR> <BR>Btw, I am without $549 at the moment to buy
  Fontlab, any other way I can turn this into a font from an EPS file? <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: This is nice. I&#39;m not sure what i&#39;d use it for, but  <BR>it&#39;s
    still nice. The only comment I&#39;d make is  <BR>that your numerals look too
    bland compared  <BR>to the lc. So much, that it looks to me like a  <BR>different
    font. Add some of the &#34;shard-ness&#34; or  <BR>was that &#34;sharditude,&#34;
    to them. <BR> <BR>On the other hand... <BR>I&#39;d say your lc is just right.
    Yes there are  <BR>some characters that have less of the  <BR>&#34;shardification,&#34;
    but i tend to feel like less  <BR>weirdness is better because it makes a font  <BR>more
    usable/readable &#40;particularly in a lower  <BR>case&#41; . Otherwise it becomes
    really difficult to  <BR>read and really narrow in it&#39;s application  <BR>&#40;klingon
    spaceship lettering only :-&#41;. You&#39;ve got  <BR>it right here IMHO.  <BR>
    <BR>If you want, I&#39;d think more of the caps could be  <BR>&#34;shardical.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Good luck <BR>randy <BR> <BR>Oh... shard is also just the right name.

  body: 'The &#39;d&#39; is wonderful, as well as p and q, and I like your round letters
    generally. I think there is a problem with the junctions in the vertical letters,
    especially in &#39;f&#39; and &#39;t&#39; where readability is affected.  <BR>
    <BR>Is the problem that the bottom of the left vertical on h m n etc is too fat?
    That the cut at the joint is too deep?  <BR> <BR>Is the &#39;southwest&#39; part
    of the e and c too fat? <BR> <BR>I suspect the bottom of the &#39;l&#39; either
    straight or like the right bottom of h will look more harmonious. <BR> <BR>I think
    that your round letters are so original and good that making the vertical ones
    more harmonious with them will result in a very useful display face. Even if the
    vertical are more conventional, but harmonious, the look will still be very original
    and intriguing. <BR> <BR>I am a beginner so listen to the pros, but I think you
    have a gem that is still half in the rough.  '

  body: Andrew, I strongly recommend you not buy Fontographer. Instead buy the $199
    <a href="http://fontlab.com/html/scanfont.html">Scanfont</a> from Pyrus, which
    comes bundled with TypeTool 2.0, a light version of FontLab that still matches
    or exceeds Fontographer. Once you need the added power of FontLab, they&#39;ll
    sell you an upgrade at a reduced price. It&#39;s really the best family of products
    if you&#39;re new at this. <BR> <BR>Telling a newbie to buy Fontographer is like
    telling them to buy Ikarus. You&#39;re not doing them any favors.

  body: Fair enough, $42 for Fog is pretty cool, assuming that&#39;s what it finally
    sold for. But I would still not recommend it for someone brand new to the craft
    who hasn&#39;t had his UI preferences skewed toward The Fog Way. <BR> <BR>He should
    at least download the TypeTool demo and see if he likes it better. <BR> <BR>By
    the way, Shard is a pretty good design, so if he&#39;s going to get started in
    this, he might as well try starting in TypeTool. <BR> <BR>:-&#41;

  body: 'Some of the capitals you&#39;ve drawn are very good sketches. Especially
    the C, D E and F. <BR>For the G, try to keep it consistent with the C. The same
    goes for B and R. <BR>If the idea behind Shard is to have a pretty good deal of
    anarchy among letters, you&#39;re always in time to add it later. <BR>Out of experience
    I can tell you it&#39;s always best to keep an internal consistence among letter
    parts. Then, you may change many of them and introduce the desired degree of randomness.
    <BR>Maybe after the summer I should post a typeface I started in 1999, full of
    hydiosincracies and with a wide array of influences. Usually I find uncomfortable
    to discuss in public, and I prefer single discussion with each one of friend and
    colleagues, but I got stuck at least two times with that face: it&#39;s too varied.
    <BR> <BR>But since Barry Deck pretty liked it &#40;his Eunuverse was one of the
    initial influences&#41; I might find useful any imput. <BR>I said this because,
    in some ways, Shard has problem&#40;s&#41; similar to the ones I find in my own
    freezed typeface.'

  body: I, also, think that this face has tons of potential. While looking at the
    l.c., I wonder if you have considered reconciling the ascenders of b, d, h, and
    k? More specifically, could the ascender of the d &#40;which is a handsome character&#41;
    work if inverted horizontally to match that of b, h and k? <BR>Also, when setting
    your characters in rather short entries &#40;headlines, etc.&#41;, is a &#34;font&#34;
    absolutely necessary at this time? Could the letters be placed carefully in a
    vector drawing program and then imported into the final application of choice?
    Yes, I know, quite a bit of labour... but in the short term, this procedure might
    replace the absolute necessity of purchasing a font-building program... until
    you have more coin.

    able in sketching, why don&#39;t you use this and really start up from scratch
    to answer your professors demand &#40;if you really want to answer it!&#41;. I
    am saying this, because the last sample you showed us is not as good as shard.
    Try sketching on different  ways &#39;hamburgerfontsiv&#39; and the digitalize
    it. For example with Illustrator. You&#39;ll see that you&#39;ll come up with
    more interesting results and you might even start to understand &#39;typography&#39;
    quicker as you mighth think so. <BR>Third: In your last post your have mixed up
    several styles. Beware. Typography can be about concistance, sometimes combined
    with small irregularities.  <BR> <BR>---Jacques'

  body: Jacques, I know that drawing my letterforms by hand is what i should be doing.
    So why dont I do it? I am stubborn. Hand-drawing for good results requires much
    practice, and I am impatient and want to dive in.  <BR> <BR>John Langdon was my
    professor at Drexel and not surprisingly he tells me the same thing. To draw to
    a refined form before I digitize. I keep saying that I will, but I dont. <BR>

  body: Hi Andrew, <BR> <BR>I think you should continue with Shard. See, the lowercases
    are really nice. I respectfully disagree with your teacher, who asked you to draw
    more tradicional characters. The lowercases are far from traditional designs,
    so should be the uppercases. <BR> <BR>Also, about drawing sketches... to me it&#39;s
    something very particullar the way we design. That&#39;s not a rule that you have
    to draw all characters on paper. I respectfull typefoundry I know, sketches just
    main letters like &#34;n&#34; and &#34;o&#34; and do the rest directly at Fontographer.
    <BR>One think I&#39;m sure, no matter if we design type with hand or mouse, the
    most important are our eyes. <BR>Fabio

  body: That new &#34;conventional&#34; design is only useful for practicing certain
    skills in type design - otherwise neither the culture nor the market of type design
    need it. <BR> <BR>John Langdon is a talented letterer more than a type designer.
    <BR> <BR>There is no real requirement of drawing on paper first &#40;although
    that&#39;s how I do it myself&#41;. Although it can be argued that drawing software
    has yet to be made as compatible with the human hand as the pencil &#40;and not
    the fancy broadnib pen - I&#39;m talking about drafting, not chirography&#41;,
    one should also note that the very best designers &#40;like Carter&#41; draw directly
    on the computer. So it seems to be a matter of personal affinity as well as getting
    used to it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Fabio, sorry for the miscommunication. What he had advised is not a more traditional
    approach with Shard in particular, but to put it aside and experiment with something
    less unique. I took this to mean &#34;more traditional&#34;. Maybe I mispoke.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant, I suspect Carter has had his share of drafting experience under
    his belt, and now works exclusively digitally? I&#39;m just one year out of design
    school. Realistically, I wonder if I can be expected to work competently digitally.
    <BR> <BR>I think I may have jumped to digital too quickly given my knowledge of
    type, hence the noticeable inconsistencies of my designs. I find the constant
    reworking on paper more frustrating to deal with than tinkering with glyphs on
    a computer. Probably I just ignore my mistakes much easier on computer where I
    cannot on paper?  <BR>  <BR>Andrew <BR> <BR>
