  and headlines. The logo may by customized, but they use a version of it for the
  headline fonts on their cover.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mojo4music.com/html/mojo_new_issue.shtml\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone knows, it would be appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n- Christopher"

    No. 2</a> on the cover and customized it for the logo. Some ill-advised <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.398.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=4+MUSIC&sampleSize=48">Lithos</a>
    on that site too.

  body: Yeah, that J isn't quite Lithos, nor is anything on the cover, but it's certainly
    used on the website.

  body: "Yeah, I know the logo had been modified. It appears it's mostly Metro, looking
    at your links.\r\n\r\nWorking at a magazine where there is pretty much zero communication
    between the print art department and those that do the website, I imagine that
    whoever did the websiite logo didn't know what the banner/headline font was either
    and just picked Lithos - maybe from finding a match for the Lithos \"J\" in the
    logo - and used it for the \"4MUSIC\" part of the web logo. But on the cover of
    the mag, it seems to definitely be Metro, possibly the Geometric.\r\n\r\nThis
    is perfect. Thanks for the help everyone!\r\n \r\n- Christopher "
