  body: "Guy shows up at the cathouse he usually visits to see the gal he usually
    sees. It's snowing slightly on the Bowery and a grizzled old man sits on the stoop
    next door. The Madam answers the door and as she closes it and welcomes her client,
    she also shouts for the old man to go away. The john goes upstairs to his usual
    gal and they start to figure out what they want to do \"this time.\" She suggests
    the shower. \"Nahhh\" he says, \"we did that last month. \"The upside down thing,\"
    she proposes. \"Like last week?\" he says. It starts snowing more heavily as they
    make their way out of the window and onto the roof. \"We've never done it outside,
    much less in snow,\" he points our as he lowers his drawers. They start in on
    it as the snow begins to accumulate heavily and she's starting to get really into
    it. They go and go and go until they are nearly exhausted and though still connected
    are nearly buried in the snow. Finally he finishes but it's so cold now they've
    frozen together covered in frozen snow and sweat and can't fit back in the window.
    Stumbling around while still connected on the roof he slips off and she along
    with him to crash, frozen in position into a snow drift on the street. The startled
    old man lurches out of the way, and up to the cathouse door which he knocks on.
    The Madam answers and shouts at him again, \"Go on, get out of here, you are never
    coming in my house.\" \r\n\r\n\"I don't want to come in,\" he shouts over the
    storm, \"I just wanted to tell you, your sign fell down.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a type
    joke! Edward de Benguiat told it to me once when I was young. \r\n"

  body: A tarted up blonde walks into a bar. The guy at the next bar stool immediately
    starts hitting on her, he buys her a drink, starts boasting about his cool wheels
    outside. When he goes too far and puts his hand on her ass, she throws her drink
    in his face and stalks out of the bar. The bartender says to the guy "Hey buddy,
    you gotta show the ladies some respect". The guy replies "Her? She was just some
    bembo."
