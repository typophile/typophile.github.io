body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nA colleague of mine is setting some type for a business card.
  She's asked me to give my two cents on this preliminary comp. It's set in 6.75/8.25
  Sabon Next Regular Small Caps. The first line is demibold.\r\n\r\nMy first impression
  is that the \"60606\" is really annoying to look at (I'd imagine there's got to
  be more New Yorkers with this problem). It really draws attention to the bizarre
  axis in the 0. I believe other (\"regular\") versions of Sabon ([[http://typophile.com/node/16304|and
  Caslon, for that matter]]) have oldstyle zeros that are closer to circles... \r\n\r\nAny
  other critique is welcome, too...I'm sure she'd love to hear what everyone has to
  say."

    or small-caps \"o\"?\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: "I used to feel that way about Stempel Garamond but from a useability point-of-view
    it is unambiguous. What does bother me is the tracking combined with the colour,
    I would be tempted to close up the tracking and use upper and lower case for the
    e-mail address even if I couldn\u2019t get it on one line. If there is space I
    would introduce a half-line space before the telephone numbers to separate them
    still more from the address, while still linking them to the particular address
    and make them easier to pick out.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Less letterspacing with the same leading or more leading with the same letterspacing.\r\nAnd
    I find the colour of these caps not quite comparable to the small caps, but that
    could be Kobayashi\u2019s doing, I guess.\r\n___\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
