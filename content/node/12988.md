    of an Adobe only software provider is frightening. We (as consumers) need Quark.

  body: "I haven't \"upgraded\" since 4.3\r\nFirst, because I didn't need to, being
    quite happy with that version, and then later because Quark had major shortcomings
    -- \"running in Classic\" and lack of OpenType support were no good -- so I switched
    to InDesign a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\nHowever, I recently saw a demo of Quark
    7, which will support OpenType, and it looked good, so I will definitely get it
    when it comes out \"later this year\". As it was the first software I learned
    (1989, for goodness sake!) I have a soft spot for it."

  body: "Competition in design and typography software is healthy and vital to consumers
    who need it to be well supported, updated with features we need, and reasonably
    priced for our typically meager means.  I am sorry to see Macromedia absorbed
    and hope a new player has the guts to join the fray.  \r\nI used and championed
    Quark since version one (complete with parent/child boxes) and for years hoped
    they would pick up on the customer service thing.  They refused and hence will
    die.  I feel it is too late for anything with the Quark brand to succeed.  Someone
    else will have to buy it, change the name and do it right to succeed in the Adobe
    only world.  I do not fault Adobe, they have done a good job and should be applauded.
    \ I just feel that the lack of competition will take its toll and end up with
    less happy customers than now.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    a couple of CS2 tryout apps (golive & illy) today, and I was very, very disappointed.
    \r\n\r\n/Rant mode on/\r\n\r\nGolive is outdated IMHO, and tries to look like
    a pro web-authoring app but still is a kind of bloated wysiwyg web-editor. From
    a professional CSS-webdesigner point of view, it seems useless.\r\nNVU is freeware
    and still in progress, but does a far better job. \r\n\r\nIllustrator seemed more
    like an 11.5 update than a 12. Agreed, the trace-tool is cool, and the control-palette
    is a fine idea, but there are still features missing.  And the UI consistency
    between the CS apps is not much better either. Somebody has to tell those guys
    that UI goes beyond the fact that every palette has the same \"ugly rounded cornered
    tab\". \r\n\r\nI couldn't see Indesign CS2 yet, but it seems the updates there
    are more substancial. \r\n\r\nGuess I'll keep my money ;-)\r\n\r\n/Rant Mode Off/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm of two minds about all this. On the one hand I really like the fact that
    InDesign is replacing Quark. I always hated XPress with a fervor and every time
    I have to touch it again I remember why... it's one of the most anti-intuitive
    tools ever. I work with InDesign and hardly touch anything else anymore, it's
    simply the best layout software available right now. So yeah, bye Quark, good
    riddance. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you don't monopolize without a reason. You
    monopolize to cash in. We will see that a monolithic Adobe will do less and cost
    more, the creativity will go from developing software into how to squeeze as much
    money as you can out of your customers. This doesn't HAVE to happen (Photoshop
    already is the singular pro-tool for editing print images, yet they still deliver
    new features with every version), but I'm sure it will tend towards that scenario.
    \r\n\r\nInDesign came out of the need to have something BETTER than Pagemaker
    to compete with Quark. Without the competition, there will be a lack of stimulus
    to come up with something \xABbetter\xBB. And we will all lose because of that.
    \r\n\r\nIn the long run, I reckon, small companies will make up for that, and
    OpenSource software might pop up doing a fine job of keeping the market on its
    toes, but you never know... there might not be an OpenOffice-pendant for Indesign.
    And Gimp, so far, is no Photoshop either. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, while a part of me
    is more than happy to see Quark go to its well-deserved rest at the elephant graveyard,
    another part of me is very very frightened about Adobe becoming the kings and
    queens of all they survey.  \r\n\r\nHD Schellnack"

  body: Corel stopped making Mac upgrades for their Corel Draw and their version of
    Photoshop when they polled their clients and found that less than 1% were Mac
    users. So they aren't likely to jump back into that market. Another hope is Apple,
    they seem to be getting back into the software application busniess, maybe they
    will see an opportunity.

  body: "The company I work for (I work in Reprographics) has just updated to Quark
    6.5. The first and foremost reason is that they have literally thousands of existing
    Quark documents that are continuously being twaeked and reprinted. We experimented
    with opening the Quark docs in InDesign but too much changed on import to make
    it economical. Because we have a pure pdf workflow we were able to look at other
    options for what app to use. Quark was still the easiest transition for us and
    our work flow.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I am disappointed with the performance
    of 6.5. Having upgraded from v5 (and hence working in Classic) I was expecting
    the OS X native version to fly. It doesn't. It is however still a good layout
    and typesetting app which is what it is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nWhen dabbling with
    InDesign I find I cannot control the trapping as well as I can in Quark. For example
    InDesign has a preference for overprinting black and it is either ticked or not
    ticked. In Quark you control the trapping for each item in the Trapping palette
    which is exactly what I want to do. As a reprographic operater I want total contol
    over things like trapping settings. InDesign feels like half a design app and
    half a page layout app whereas I see Quark as a big cooking pot where you put
    all of your elements, lay them out and get them ready for the printers. I should
    really use InDesign a lot more for pure page layout and reprographics to give
    it a fair chance.\r\n\r\nQuark really need to get their act together though. Speed,
    stability and little niggling bugs all need to be weeded out. Half arsed attempts
    at putting features in that Photoshop will do, and has done much much better for
    a good few years now, is not what Quark needs. Similarly, Adobe need to address
    what the app (InDesign) IS. They ship the CS Suite with Illustartor, Photoshop
    and Acrobat. Is processing power, speed and fluidity being wasted on features
    in one app that are far superior in another app in the same suite?\r\n\r\nQuark
    may have left it too late. V7 needs to overcome a lot of hurdles, mainly to persuade
    people that have moved away from the app that they do actually care and listen
    to the people that buy and use the software and that the users of the app, and
    what it is used for, are the most important factors in its survival and not how
    many useless features can be packed in."

  body: "Ahhh, that's lovely. I was getting confused between the actual box colour
    and whether that had a fill and what trap settings were applied. Didn't realise
    that I could then select the text  and the attributes could then be re-set to
    accomodate. I could kick myself.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I have much more experience
    with Quark and really must start to seriously use ID so I can get around things
    like this. That preference with the always overprint black kind of threw me. What
    was happening was the overprint black box was ticked so no matter what I set the
    attributes to, I could never get the black text to knock out....\r\n\r\nAlso I
    have to spend more time on the Trap Styles as well. In Quark there is the single
    trapping dialog. You select the item, be it text, picture, filled box etc and
    simply select the trapping amount, overprint, knockout for each item. That's my
    next task for gaining more experience in ID.\r\n\r\nThanks again Tina"

  body: I used to be a Quark-user for many years. About 1 and half year ago I switched
    over to InDesign, The way Quark act towards users and their "backwardness" rater
    than the oposite, together with the smooth transition with InDesign makes mew
    100% sure I will never return. If Quark doesn't do something really drastic (like
    lower their prize 80% or so) they will go out of business soon. By that I don't
    say it's a blessing having Adobe in control almost everywhere, but the crappy
    management which Quark show as a company in simply amazing and they will mostly
    have themselves to blame.
