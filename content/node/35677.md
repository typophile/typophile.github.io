  they are discussing whether some names of fictional characters in Die Hard 4 were
  inspired by type designers' or typeface names. The text is in German but the screenshots
  shown should be obvious. Seems to be on a computer screen in the film.\r\nCan we
  identify where all the names come from? Or is it just our typomania that makes us
  see things that are not present?"
