  going to use it for print purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/256tm/minuscule/\">Minuscule</a> was
    designed for that exact purpose.\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\nMinuscule was inspired by \xC9mile
    Javal\u2019s research into the physiology of reading. He was a 19th-century opthalmologist,
    the first to analyze how we read.\r\n\r\nMinuscule characteristics are large x-height,
    robust slab serifs, vertical stress, open structure, big counters, low contrast.\r\n\r\nMinuscule
    is a typeface for extremely small sizes, and can be used under the commonly acknowledged
    threshold of legibility (around 7 points). At this stage, the loss is so important
    during the shift to a lower size that I quickly decided to design a master for
    each size. Five versions have been developed, optimized for a use in 6 (Minuscule
    Six), 5 (Minuscule Cinq), 4 (Minuscule Quatre), 3 (Minuscule Trois) and 2 pts
    (Minuscule Deux).\r\n\r\nMinuscule received the Certificate of Excellence in Type
    Design from the Type Directors Club New York, in the TDC2 2005 Type Design Competition
    (category Text)."

    was created for the phone book. It reads quite well at very small sizes. Also
    see Font Bureau's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GriffithGothic|Griffith Gothic]].\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=meta&x=0&y=0|Meta]]
    too has legibility roots and does well when set at small sizes.\r\n\r\n"
