  a font. It's actually the logo for the company I work for, [[http://www.inktweb.nl/|Inktweb.nl]],
  \ but unfortunately we lost contact with the designer. The logo has been bothering
  me for ages because I don't know what it is based on. \r\n\r\nAt the first glance
  it looks like Arial but because of the modified 'i', 't' and 'e' it's impossible
  (for me) to tell. Can you help?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tWnaq.jpg\"
