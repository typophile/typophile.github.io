body: I was thinking about designers trading services for other services or products,
  and was wondering what other designers have traded for...rent, computers, etc. I'm
  particularly interested in humorous trades.

  body: I once designed a store sign for a hair salon, so my wife could get free haircuts
    for a year. That's the oddest thing I've traded for. To be honest she sort of
    volunteered me for it, but since womens haircuts can be quite pricey I wasn't
    complaining too much.

  body: My experience is that you can almost never get the fair market value for design
    through trade. Always the person feels like their physical product is more valuable
    than the design work. Particularly problematic are situations where the trade
    is paid back slowly over time (never trade with a restaurant, they'll get sick
    of you, and you'll get sick of the food). Almost always the trader forgets the
    urgency that they had when they initially needed the service. At any rate good
    trading requires good accounting of actual values and "payments".

  body: Btw, I designed a coffee house takeout menu for a few pounds of French Roast.
    I used Pumpkinseed, which was the most expensive font I had ever bought up to
    that time.

  body: "For an artist's monograph I'm designing now I'm taking 1/3 of my fee in the
    form of a painting. I'm gonna come out way ahead - his paintings sell for beaucoup
    bucks at a major NY gallery and he's going to give me one at a dramatically reduced
    rate. He's going to let me choose - he'll give me several examples. It worked
    out well for him too.\r\n\r\nTo hell with the IRS. Until my government starts
    funding education and environmental initiatives instead of a ridiculous war, they
    don't deserve a penny extra from me."

  body: "The place I work at belongs to a program called Tradebank.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tradebankcanada.ca/\r\n\r\nI
    don't like it much since my boss is always giving us work to do, so he can build
    points at various merchants like, restaurants, random shops, and print houses.
    It feels like we are taking work away from local talent. I've had numerous arguments
    with him over this but he just doesn't see it my way."

    for some landscaping services. I built a web site, they came and planted plants.
    Alas, of the $350 worth of plants, only 3 survived, so I think I got the raw end
    of the deal.\r\n\r\nI've also traded for things like photography. At the last
    design firm I worked for, we did free design for the cafe in the building. Nothing
    better than free lunches!"

  body: "I've traded for fishing equipment, hotel rooms, and liquor (not all the same
    trade).\r\n\r\nI don't see anything wrong with it; I remember my dad helping a
    neighbor with some tuckpointing, and coming home with a fresh-baked pie. And it
    makes me feel good to know that someone values my work and that I, also, appreciate
    the value in what they do."

  body: There's some winery whose name I can't remember, that has lushly illustrated
    labels done by some of the top illustrators in the world. Their payment is a couple
    of cases of wine. It was written about in HOW a while back. Or Print, or one of
    those magazines.

    remember if it was a French or California one, and had been paid \"in kind\"....\r\n\r\nNow
    that is a job I wouldn't mind working a barter trade on!"
