  body: 'Smart, but the A''s look too short and a bit too narrow. You might want to
    rethink the bottom right of the Ns. I''d like to see them going into more of a
    point. '

  body: I like the Ns. It's the As and S that bother me. Maybe making the top of the
    As blunt like the bottom of the N would work? I'm definitely no expert, but I
    like how this is looking.

  body: The A's look a couple of points smaller than the rest of the style - give
    them a bit more overhang and make them a bit wider, I'd suggest. Maybe poke down
    the crossbar a little bit. And maybe kern the second one a bit tighter with the
    L and the N?

  body: 'The N is great, really great! The others not so great. A: The bar needs lowering,
    and perhaps some more weight. I would also try slimming the left leg. I agree
    with Letterjay about the apex. H: The stems are too heavy. It could also be slightly
    wider. L: Heavy stem and spindly right side (terminology?). S: Try examining some
    other didones (might I suggest Didot Elder with it''s unique terminals) to see
    how they solve it. These are always tricky to get right. The apostrophe: Bigger,
    more dramatic!'
