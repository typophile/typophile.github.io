    to draw it. Even if you can't draw it'll look good because those were made to
    look bad!

  body: "Yeah they most likely didn't use any existing fonts, info on something similar
    would still be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso looking for something similar
    to the font on Virgin Airlines logo. Found out that there was a font called VirginAirlines
    or something made by some aeroplane enthusiast but that it hasn't been uploaded
    anywhere since 2005 or so.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VirginLogo_4820.gif]"
