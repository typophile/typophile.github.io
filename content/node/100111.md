  encoding should I use? I've been searching for clear answers, but am still confused.
  My font is a PS flavour .otf

  body: "It also depends on how extensive you want to get with your Cyrillic and Greek
    support.\r\n\r\nBasic Greek, or polytonic?\r\n\r\nBasic Cyrillic, or extended
    Cyrillic?\r\n\r\nHeck, one could ask the same thing about your Latin coverage.
    If you are going to also be doing Greek and Cyrillic, I would think you would
    *at least* do Adobe Latin 3 (includes Windows Eastern European, Baltic and Turkish
    codepages). But you can go even further if you like.\r\n\r\nA couple of references:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/08/defining_an_ext.html\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "Well, I'm not worried about coverage. I have the glyphs I want to include,
    but they do not show up in the .otf font that I am generating. This is a pretty
    simple font (all caps) that I am extending (from my own design) as a first step
    in learning about Cyrillic and Greek alphabets.\r\n\r\nI feel right now that what
    I want to do is set encoding to ISO 8859-1 Latin1 + ISO 8859-5 Cyrillic. I know
    that doesn't work. But is there a default unicode encoding I can set the font
    to that will let me support the multiple character sets?\r\n\r\nMy goal is a font
    that will work in Illustrator/InDesign. "

  body: "You don't need to do anything but assigning the correct Unicode values to
    your characters.\r\n\r\nInDesign, Illustrator, and all other type related software
    worth its salt are oblivious of any of the encodings you mention. The reason is
    that these \"encodings\" are meant as a Unicode-to-8 bit table translation. What
    will happen when you select one of them, is that FontLab will re-order your <em>Unicode</em>
    characters into the encoding specified, delete the rest (?) and export only the
    characters in that specific encoding.\r\n\r\nIs it required to select an encoding
    in FontLab? If so, choose something sounding like \"Unicode (BMP)\"."

  body: "I think this is where I went wrong. Never had the problem before of characters
    getting cut off when I imported a font file, but I've been playing around with
    encodings (just to see what characters were included) and seem to have stuck my
    font inside one... I think it is sorted out now. At least, the Cyrillic is showing
    up again.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help here."
