    find any name), exclusive for Nescaf\xE9 and not available to sell. Kevin's first

    remind me of Fred Smeijers' [[http://www.fontshop.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sansa|Sansa]]
    (Soft). From the same foundry, I like also [[https://www.fontshop.com/families/corbeau|Corbeau]].
    Sorkin Type [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/armata|Armata]] is another one
    you may like."
