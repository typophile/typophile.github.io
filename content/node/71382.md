  but sure others will! What a cool idea...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.citid.net/\">CitID</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>CitID
  is a ambitious project aiming to gain global consciousness by giving a (type)face
  to every city worldwide; big or small, rich or poor, famous or infamous, well-known
  or unheard-of. \r\n\r\n<cite>Ever heard of Tegucicalpa? How about Sandnes or Brunswick?
  Probably not. Right now they're just hard-to-pronounce foreign words that you will
  not remember. The fact is, they are all cities somewhere on our planet. Places you're
  most likely never to visit. Through this project you will become aware of them,
  and maybe even remember their names; Here you get to meet them personally and visually,
  in an inspiring artistic context.\r\n\r\n<cite>Our hope is that creatives from around
  the globe will make a logo or a visual interpretation of the city closest to their
  heart. The universal goal is that every city ultimately gets their own identity
  on CitID, and that both the city and it\u2019s aesthetic contributor gets recognition
  through this library - a place where you come for visual inspiration and leave with
  more knowledge about the world we live in.</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd how nice to see Jos's
  Museo online!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Strange that they say in the first line that it's about giving a <em>typeface</em>
    to every city, when in fact these aren't typefaces.

  body: I think it means a face/representation in/of type rather than a typeface.
    We could have our own type battle to make a typeface representing the towns and
    cities we live in.
