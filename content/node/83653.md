body: "I am looking for a book or short essay on gestalt design principles that I
  can assign to my introductory students. I need something dead simple that can be
  understood by students with no formal art or design education whose first language
  is often not English. That means no academic language, no history of gestalt theories,
  and no discussions of gestalt theories outside the context of art and design. I
  do not care if this is a book for preschoolers; I just need something that gets
  the point across without no extraneous details.\r\n\r\nI know that there are some
  great online essays about this stuff. I am looking for hard copy!"

    book was helpful before I was formally introduced to 2D design and gestalt principles.
    \r\nISBN10: 0471289604, ISBN13: 978-0471289609 I would think you have already
    come across it."
