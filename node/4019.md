  body: Apart from the &#34;l&#34;, &#34;leste&#34; looks like BetaSemi too, tho I
    can&#39;t  <BR>judge if the soft corners are as rounded as on your sample. <BR>The
    &#34;l&#34; might&#39;ve been customized starting with a &#34;t&#34; and the  <BR>&#34;st&#34;
    ligature is not so hard to make.
