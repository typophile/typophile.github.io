    be me, I&#39;m not that flamboyant. It also reminds me of another face &#40;the
    non-swashy version&#41; that came with TypeStyler when it first came out. But,
    I can&#39;t think of the name. Hmm. Where did you get this sample? It isn&#39;t

    <BR> <BR>Ugh. I hope not. I do appreciate and enjoy old Victorian design and typography,
    but it&#39;s so set in its time. It&#39;s difficult to do that style without it
    coming off as parody or ironic or nostalgic. On the other hand, I do think the
    Victorian spirit is alive and well every time I see design where style and form
    completely upstage the message.

  body: I don&#39;t know, that Victorian style seems to always be around in some form
    or another. In the sixties, it seemed to be equated with comedy, probably a reference
    to Vaudeville. Then there was the whole &#40;ironic&#41; counterculture/rock adoption
    of the style &#40;Sgt. Pepper, <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine, etc.&#41;. I&#39;m
    sure this sort of thing will continue to happen.

  body: Though theft and borrowing was fairly rampant among nineteenth century foundries,
    I doubt the Cleveland version is based on the MS&amp;J. Bit more happening with
    the former. They usually don&#39;t clean up this well. Could very well be the
    inverse. Hate to call any of this stuff Victorian. What actually is that? I think
    you need to look at late eighteenth century French foundry specimen books to find
    the origins of many of the Anglo-American nineteenth century display faces.

    orginally designed by William J Jackson for MacKellar Smiths &amp; Jordan. Patent
    design 1888. <BR> <BR>This means that the initials you are asking about, with
    the Cleveland pinmark, are misidentified. <BR> <BR>Cleveland Type Foundry went
    from 1875 to 1892 when they were absorbed by ATF. Several catalogs were issued
    during this time period. <BR> <BR>In looking through the Bidwell book on the acquisitions
    of ATF I would guess, based on a showing of very similar initials from Cleveland
    that these are actually called the Euclid Series. But without the face in front

    and Marks&#39; Koster was in there, as was... a face called Euclid &#40;like Gerald
    said&#41; by the Cleveland foundry which matches the font in question! It actually
    has a full alphabet with lc, and the stuff I&#39;ve seen is the swash caps. <BR>
    <BR>However, I&#39;m still looking for info on this font &#40;so Euclid, not Koster&#41;
    like <BR>who made it, was there an earlier version, etc. Thanks for any leads!
