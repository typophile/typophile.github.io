body: 'I&#39;ve been after a certain elusive font since this time yesterday,but I
  haven&#39;t had any luck yet. If someone could help,I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.
  <BR> <BR>It belongs to a rock band,The Distillers. <BR> <BR>The font can be found:
  <BR> <BR>1.&#41;On the cover of their new album,CORAL FANG in the top-left corner.  <BR>
  <BR>2.&#41;All over their website,THEDISTILLERS.COM. Also,  <BR>the first thing
  you see on the site is either the &#34;safe&#34; album cover or the original. BOTH
  have the font. <BR> <BR>IMPORTANT: If you type DISTILLERS.COM instead of THEDISTILLERS.COM,
  it&#39;s a different site. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>ThreeChairsBlack  <BR> <BR>'

  body: Me too -- I had a feeling this was going to be a free one, but I only checked
    Da Font and MyFonts -- haven&#39;t thought about Blambot recently, so it&#39;s
    nice to have a reminder.

    scratched&#41;but it&#39;s also just a good font in general-it has almost all
    the characters in it!
