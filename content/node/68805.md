body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm an illustration major working on my graduation project
  which is an illustrated biography of Jean-Francois Champollions (1790 \u2013 1832),
  the decipherer of the Egyptian hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\nBeing an illustrator I'm sadly
  not very typography savvy so I could really use some help. \r\n\r\nThe text I'm
  working with is a mix of narrative and original letters so I'm looking for two fonts:
  a handwritten one I can use for the letters and a normal seriph-font for the narrative
  text, both with a sort of French early 19th century feel.\r\n\r\nSuggestions would
  be much appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Honestly, I couldn't think of a digital Didot as a good choice as a body
    text typeface, given the strong contrast of thick/thin serifs and the inherent
    weakness of early digital Didot type translations. But a little search gave some
    interesting results:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/serif_didone/\r\n\r\nFor
    example, Didot LP by Letter Perfect and FF Cellini seem to be very appropriate."

  body: I use Hoefler+Frere-Jones' Didot and I'd say they have plenty of optical choices
    that you could definitely use their Didot for the body.

  body: You can also have a look at http://gallica.bnf.fr/Search?q=champollion where
    you will get digitized texts (some printed by Firmin-Didot) dating from the period
    you asked for.
