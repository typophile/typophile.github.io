  one for a while. I haven't been able to find any official documentation from Beaurepaires
  regarding their new logo either. It's a more geometric, less human version of Helvetica
  with horizontal and vertical terminals.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nVincent\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beaurepaires_5213.png]"
