<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I've always thought that Calcite nodded to some of Neville Brody's work, like <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/industria/>Industria</a> for example. When looking at the examples of Chagrin, I can't help but be reminded of both Berhold's <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/city/>City</a> and Zuzana's <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/cholla/>Cholla</a>. These aren't bad things. In fact, I love this type of character squarishness. <br> <br>Chagrin has a friendlier feel to me, as compared to the others mentioned above. I'd have to say that I actually prefer the first version of the serif. It's more distinctive from the other variation. Although the second one blends better with the sans and semiserif weights, maybe that's the point.</div>

<div class=commentbody>First of all, I think Chagrin is superior to Calcite, and certainly to the other fonts mentioned. It's novel without feeling affected. <br> <br>Although I personally don't like very dark weights, it seems the Heavy embodies the most interesting essence. The other two weights don't seem genuine enough, especially not the Regular. <br> <br>Your serif tests at the bottom give me an idea: maybe this is a good design to implement the concept that different weight can sometimes have different structures. Specifically, I see the Heavy as being happiest in the "Serif 2" scheme (the "Serif 1" has too many serifs), while the Regular might really get into its own as a sans. Which might mean the Bold should be a semi? <br> <br>Also, some of the structures aren't translating well from the Heavy down to the Regular. Like the upper arm of the "a" is wonderfully short in the Heavy, but too long in the Regular. And the "e" is superb in the Heavy, but gets too square as it gets lighter. <br> <br>So I suspect you're doing the "weight loss" too literally - I'd give the lighter weights more roundness for example. <br> <br>BTW, that "rationalist" lc "s" (the one where the stroke stress is vertical) is just great. And your vertical proportions are right on. <br> <br>Lastly: I'm getting a tingle when I think about italic possibilities for this... <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>It seems the Heavy embodies the most interesting essence. The other two weights don't seem genuine enough, especially not the Regular.</i> <br>This is definitely true. The heavy makes the most of the square/round contrast while the regular just seems square. <br> <br><i>So I suspect you're doing the "weight loss" too literally - I'd give the lighter weights more roundness for example.</i> <br>Agreed. More roundness in the regular would make it more texworthy also. The trick is keeping the flavor of the heavy, with a different structure! Back to the drawing board for that. <br> <br><i>Your serif tests at the bottom give me an idea: maybe this is a good design to implement the concept that different weight can sometimes have different structures. Specifically, I see the Heavy as being happiest in the "Serif 2" scheme (the "Serif 1" has too many serifs), while the Regular might really get into its own as a sans. Which might mean the Bold should be a semi?</i> <br> <br>Hmm, that's a thought I hadn't considered. Are there other fonts that do this successfully? My guess is that the serifs are going to be what keeps the the regular weight looking like it's part of the same family after I add more roundness. Anybody else have thoughts about this idea? <br> <br><i>Lastly: I'm getting a tingle when I think about italic possibilities for this...</i> <br>I'm just gonna oblique it! Ha! <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy, I think you might have actually gone too far: don't lose the straight segments on the insides of the counters (not just for aesthetic reasons, but also for easy interpolation). Here's an idea: where the flats are in the Heavy, keep at least some flatness in the lighter weights, but make them angled (not horizontal), and <i>then</i> flowing into the curves. Did I explain that OK? <br> <br>One other thing: you're getting this strange "butt jut" at the lower-left of the "e", even though the stem is straight (pun unintended). Maybe shorten the straight part of the stem? <br> <br>Yeah, and the "f" height. <br> <br>BTW, I don't know if you realize, but you're moving into Unger terrority here... Which to me is a Good Thing. Curiously though, I know of only one other instance of people making type like Unger: the recent Dagen fonts. Maybe his style is slightly too fringe to imitate comfortably. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Here's an idea: ...make them angled (not horizontal), and then flowing into the curves.</i> <br>Yeah, I follow you. Actually that was the first thing I tried, but was unhappy with the angles. <br> <br><i>But also for easy interpolation</i> <br>I was planning on drawing the three weights by hand. But, for interpolation purposes, I suppose I could add the neccessary points into the heavy (ie. a sharp corner could be sub-perceptably rounded). The bold will fall somewhere in the middle. <br> <br><i>Unger terrority</i> <br>I'll take it! I wasn't thinking of his work at all actually. After Grant's comments, in the back of my mind I fancied it as a Berthold City meets Dolly. But perhaps it is more Gulliver meets Teuton? Ha! That's heady company :-) The counters definitely are wide open. To be perfectly honest the day that I started doodling I was just drooling over this <a href=http://www.kimeratype.com/mac/tipogaleriasorjuana.html>sketch</a> by Gabriel Mart</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, I have some more feedback based on the cavalry PDF. Interestingly, the Regular seems to have more problems that the Heavy, and the Bold consistently has just a diluted subset of those. <br> <br>Overall: <br>- Are you doing something funky with your "f" height? It might make sense since it's the only ascender that's not a stick, but if so it's too pronounced. <br>- I'd make the left part of the bar of the "f" longer. <br>- Those asymmetrical foot serifs (and not just the nice long right sides in the "f" and "r") are great. <br>- Love the dots! <br>- The "k" is a conundrum. I'm not sure about that separation. <br>- I'd give the "el" a stronger foot half-serif. <br>- I'd give the "q" a stronger ear. <br>- The bottoms of "v" and "w" are too soft. <br>- I'm thinking your "y" should be v-style. <br> <br>Regular: <br>- The "a" is attractive, but it seems to have bypassed your early move to more curviness, and it's not "belonging" with the rest. Note that making it conform would actually make it very Ungerish. <br>- The leg of the "k" ends too delicately. <br>- I think the "o" is too square. <br>- The "r" beak is weak. <br>- There's something wrong with the "s". The terminals seem off, especially the top. <br>- The "t" is too shy. <br>- The right-bottom of the "x": same problem as the "k". <br> <br>Heavy: <br>- You need some of that straighness in all the arches (like in the "h"). <br> <br>BTW, I'm really liking the idea of structural divergence between the Heavy and the others. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><b>- Are you doing something funky with your "f" height?</b> <br>Not intentionally. I found if I made it taller it looked really goofy because of that hard angle in it.

<div class=commentbody>I am really enjoying this. I'm not sure if it has been mentioned, but I think this has a bit of a Fedra Serif flare to it.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks. I appreciate all the enthusiasm. I stalled out after some miscues on the caps. I've got some fresh ideas and will try them out when I get a chance. Right now I'm working on a different serif text face and have made major progress: uppers, lowers, small caps, figures and half the italics. The italics should be done next week - are they ever slippery buggers to design! Then I will get about dusting off this one. <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>The bulk of your changes seem to really work. <br> <br>The effort of putting in a binocular "g" is admirable, but this is way too grot. It has none of the iciness of the overall. I think the head is fine, but the tail is too bubbly, too "naive". As for the "y", it's fine on its own (the tail ending is great), but I'm wondering is it's too off from the "v". <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23854.gif alt> <br> <br>This close up shows what I did with the foot serifs. As you can see they are a natural extrapolation from the heavy weight. Seeing all the ducks in a row, do you still think they are too chunky? I slanted them both forward as a practical space issue in the black. No room for any other kind of treatment. I don't think it changes the original too much. It might even make it a little more *icy*. <br> <br>You can also see the interpolation changes the width of the bold and heavy weights but the regular remains at original width. <br> <br>Finally, the g: I'm gonna reserve judgement on it until I've drawn a regular g so I can see what it looks like across all weights. The problem I saw with the original g is that it looks less like a g and more like a c + j (essentially what it is). It was my least favorite of the old set so I was hankering for change. We'll see. <br> <br><i>Will any of your stuff be available in the near future?</i> <br>I sure hope so. The only font that is anywhere close to ready is the jensonesque serif. That will hopefully be available in 2004. Can't say where yet. This has a long way to go, but I hope to finish it before spring. Given that this hobby has become a serious time gobbler, it'd be nice to see a some coin from the efforts! <br> <br>Cheers. <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>To my eye the middle weights have too heavy 'boots' in the revised, interpolated version. I think your eye was better. With also the narrowing , it has moved toward wood type look which I don't particularly like, so this may be just my personal taste. The earlier version is, as I said, for me more fresh. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Typophiles, <br> <br>Here are some caps for you to chew on. These were a royal pain in the posterior. (A shoutout to Christian Robertson for his encouragement on them). The results, I think, happily relate to the lc. I intoduced the semi serifs because there is a little semi serifage happening in the lc, but also because it countered the woodtype tendency and leaves it feeling fresh. After developing this weight I'm pretty sure it will not be a straight interpolation to the regular weight. Too many quirks at this size. <br> <br>(BTW I will be reproportioning the lc, per your comments Eduardo, William) Thanks one and all! <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24147.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey, that UC looks exactly right! Very nice work. And the semi-serif action is great - I wonder if you should turn some of the full-serifs (like on the right leg of the "A") into semis. <br> <br>Don't you think they're a little bit too small? I actually like smallish caps (especially since they alleviate the need for "true" smallcaps - which very few people actually end up using), but maybe a hair larger would make them more in their [alphabetic] character. <br> <br>Some specifics: <br>A: I might make the top curl less pronounced - maybe with a short flat segment on the top-left. Your structure is working great when on the bottom ("V", etc.) but seems too soft on top. <br>B: If you can do so without destroying the rigidity, try curving the top and bottom more out, to couteract the optical effect of bowing in. <br>M: Isn't working. <br>S: Too sharp inside. <br>U: What about a full right stem? <br> <br>This font is getting amazing - I feel like squeezing the glyphs to get some chocolate icecream out of them!
