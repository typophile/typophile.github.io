  than most the monospace I'm used to work with. I expect this font to have UC, numerals,
  accents and punctuation. At the moment, only the UC are designed. \r\n\r\nComments
  and suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRaphael\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FEED-Mono_5784.jpg]"

    making the stems of the <em>M</em> perfectly vertical?\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the
    lower bowl of the <em>B</em>, as well as the bowls of the <em>P</em> and <em>R</em>,
    could stand to be a bit bigger."

  body: "I should try the vertical stems on the M.\r\n\r\nThough I really like the
    proportions of the R, I guess having a bigger lower bowl (B, P,and R) would help
    some spacing issues especially when P is next to A.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking
    of an alternate version that would have more personality, which is something I
    wanted to avoid at the very beginning. Here's A,K, and Q, alternate version. I
    guess the angular aspect of the A, and Q should be in V, X and Y too.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FEED-Mono-Alt_3671.jpg]"

    troubled monospaced character.

    you considered making the stems of the M perfectly vertical?<cite>\r\n\r\nI thought
    of it but I won't do it. Since it's a monospace and that M is already wider than
    H the angle makes the spacing a lot better.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FEEDMono-S_4806.jpg]"

    body: "Your new S has a stronger and longer diagonal than the original S.  Why
      is this better?  Does it match the other letters in a better way?  Not that
      I disagree, but I want to better understand what makes a good S.  I find it
      a very difficult letter to design.\r\n\r\nI think the rest of the letters look
      quite nice.\r\n"

  body: I like it. It feels like text from a tray on a boeing 727. Here are some ideas.
    What about dropping the cross bar of the A just slightly lower? What you have
    done to the S give it more charisma than the other glyphs have. Particularly the
    M & W. I am not sure how but perhaps you can spead some of that goodness around.
    I like the Alt Glyphs too.

  body: "Dear sgh\r\n\r\nI'm not able to explain it in a rational way. To me type
    design has something really intuitive. I think that I tried to make the curves
    of the first S almost the same, probably thinking the result would be more coherent
    to all the other characters. What happened is that the first S was too rigid.
    In the new S, curve 1 is related to curve 4, while curve 2 is related to curve
    3: the result is more fluent. \r\n\r\nI don't have the recipe of what makes a
    good S. Usually, my first sketches are always rolling forward or backward. But,
    what's important is: trust your eyes. If you're lost because your working at it
    for too long, put it aside and come back later or ask someone. \r\n\r\nI hope
    this comment helped.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FEEDMono-S2_6399.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks Eben\r\n\r\nYou were wright! I just dropped the cross bar of the A,
    makes it more open which is better, it will also help at smaller size. But I'm
    a little embarassed with your comment about the S. Though it's flattering, I wonder
    how this could spread to the M and the W. I'll keep it in mind.\r\n\r\nBTW, really
    appreciate your analogy to the tray on a boeing 727.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FEEDMono-A_6689.jpg]"

  body: "Nice diagram!\r\n\r\nThe dropped bar is more typical of those boeing letters
    - or at least as I recall them. \r\n\r\nWhat you did with the S in part was to
    add tension I think. It could be that by adding a subtle curve to the M & W's
    straight lines you could add some tension there too. Did you adjust the B & C
    too in the example above? They look less heavy slightly & seem to have more tension.
    Or am I seeing things just because of the dropped bar?\r\n\r\nI don't know if
    anything I have done in the monospace I am aming can be of help or not. It's here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29761\r\n\r\nAnd
    actually; I would love to have a critique from you as well."

    Probably the slight difference in the rendering crispness confused me too.
