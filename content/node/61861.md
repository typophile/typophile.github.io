  The best match i got was Process Seravek but no cigar.\r\n\r\nI've managed to find
  out a PDF with the multimedia and the \xE9 seems a bit off. Anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\na,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cv_5454.jpg]"

    what a font is within a PDF check out a previous post of mine.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/60752\r\n\r\nOf
    course, this only works if they didn't outline the type. If that is the case you
    won't be able to select using the 'Touchup Text Tool'."
