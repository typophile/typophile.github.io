  to know if there is a correct dash (en or em or something else) for quoting someone.
  For example:\r\n\r\n\u201CA wonderful insight into one of the most competitive fields
  of photography, a must read for the aspiring photographer.\u201D \r\n-Marcus Bell,
  Wedding Photographer\r\n\r\nI know en dashes are used only for durations, and em
  dashes are primarily used in lieu of a colon. I've seen both used (and even hypens),
  but I can't figure out which os truly correct. So that's why I've come to THE source
  for all that is good and knowledgeable for typography.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated. "

  body: "Many style guides these days don't recommend a dash at all: either put the
    attribution in parentheses after the quote, with an em space between; or without
    parentheses, right-aligned (in the same line as the quote if there's room, on
    the next line if there isn't).\r\n\r\nIf you <em>do</em> want to use a dash though,
    I'd say an em dash close up to the right-aligned style of attribution...\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else?\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver since I chose

  body: "As Dave suggests, which dash to use is really a matter of editorial style,
    not typographic style.\r\n\r\nAs a guess, I would imagine that the use of the
    dash \"began\" when the attribution was run in, not taken down. eg,\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    wonderful insight into one of the most competitive fields of photography, a must
    read for the aspiring photographer.\u201D--Marcus Bell, Wedding Photographer\r\n\r\nIn
    that case, you would use whatever is conventional for the dash in text -- a word-spaced
    en-dash in the UK, a closed-up em-dash in the States.\r\n\r\nWhen you take the
    attribution down to a new line, you can either set it (on the quote block) flush
    left, flush right, centered, indented an em left or right, etc. Or even use a
    dash, though that tends to signal form without thought. So, there is no correct
    answer, but of course, there are \"less correct\" ones. If, for example, you center
    each line of the quote, it would be odd to set the attribution flush right."

  body: "I never use any kind of dash to signal an attribution, and when designers
    doing work for us use it, I ask them to get rid of it. There are many ways to
    signal the attribution without using this unnecessary sort (\"form without thought,\"
    indeed). \r\n\r\nDave and Charles mentioned alignments and spacing. Also think
    about changing the face, to small caps or itals or to a sans (if your quote is
    set in a serif face; or vice-versa). If you are working with color, change the
    color of the attribution.\r\n\r\nIf you use enough of these tactics (face, spacing,
    alignment, color) in the right combinations, you'll gain the distinction you are
    looking for between quote and attribution. Of course, if you use too many of them,
    or in \"wrong\" combinations, you may get a dog's breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt has long
    seemed to me that one goal of good typography might be to get rid of unnecessary
    characters on a page. Thus we see some typographers specify only spacing in telephone
    numbers, no dashes or hyphens between code elements. Thus I encourage editors
    to leave out the word \"Chapter\" and \"Part\" and use only numbers at the start
    of new chapters or parts. Let the typographers impart the signals through design,
    not un-needed words.\r\n\r\npowers"

    in small caps & smallish size, to function something like a rule -- I have an
    aversion to rules, probably because I use them badly. You can use the color and
    spacing with this treatment (of a chapter number) to balance something else on
    the chapter opening page.\r\n\r\nBut we're wandering off topic (now that, I'm
    good at . . .)"

  body: Perhaps I am not the best person to listen to, as I'm fond of, to paraphrase
    Robert Bringhurst, Victorian egregiousness, but I think typographic characters
    can be beautiful for their own sake.  I prefer the traditional right-hand side,
    or at least semi-centered, attribution, and a good long em-dash.  I don't know,
    it distances the quote from the speaker to me; makes it more like its own proper
    line as opposed to a talking-head of sorts.  I suppose for book reviews and the
    like, this could be opposite from the desired effect, and it would be more appropriate
    to have the name obvious and immediate.  It's usually more important who says
    it than what is said in these cases.

  body: "\"Appropriate dash for a quote?\"\r\nIf it's a long quote, then I suggest
    a 100 yard dash, if it's a short quote, then I'd do a 40. It all depends on whether
    you want the quote to last the entire dash, or to end the quote before or after
    the dash is completed. Do you have more details?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Well I think this \"problem\" can be resolved subjectively. Yes one can follow
    the rules as stated in numerous style guides like the Chicago Manual of Style
    or as stated by Robert Bringhurst. But depending on the design itself, going away
    from the dash and opting for a more designed approach could also be the answer.
    Usually if the quote is clearly set apart from the text (ie: pull quote) I tend
    to use it as an opportunity to think of an elegant and creative solution that
    works with the overall content such as making the quote attribution in a smaller
    bold and uppercase variation of the actual quote itself. In this way it doesn't
    require a dash and at the same time (depending on the actual style formatting
    of the quote and the main body copy) it sets another level of typographic hierarchy
    within the entire piece.\r\n\r\nThe general rules are there to use as a guide
    to intelligently go away from them."
