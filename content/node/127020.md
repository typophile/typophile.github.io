body: Disclaimer, not a designer, just an amateur who appreciated beautiful fonts
  and page-layout. For an upcoming interview that I need to present printed document
  at hand and also send digital documents, I've been looking for a clear, beautiful,
  and distinct font that can also accommodate Greek. I've settled on the GFS Didot,
  redesigned by Katsoulides -I like its elegance and yet ability to function as vehicle
  for body text. I wanted to ask which font combinations you'd recommend, and whether
  you think of it as functioning on screen.  Thanks!

  body: I'm just a student - not a real desiner yet - but I have been learning that
    you can pair a serif font like didot with a sans serif but you want to find similar
    proportions in the "x hight" and other characteristics both fonts share.  For
    Greek alphabet I don't know what this rule would be, maybe look at the shapes
    of alpha and the characters with descenders and ascenders and find a font with
    similar proportions.  The other thing I learned is when in doubt USE THE SAME
    font but use a super-black heavy version or color or other method to create contrast
    between your titles and body text. Hope this helps sorry i'm not yet professional.
