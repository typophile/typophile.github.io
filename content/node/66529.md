body: "I tried to figure this one out, but no match so far: http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/252212/\r\nIt
  resembles Futura, but the umlaut and i-dots are squared and the C has the same slants
  as Erbar-Grotesk. But it is not Erbar. The G-bar isn't slanted and the S is just
  like Futura's.\r\n\r\nMore samples can be found here: http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/ham/hh-gallery/hh-gallery.htm"
