  the search of Typophile work correctly? A while ago I used it regularly and always
  got plenty of results, but lately when I tried using it I hardly get any results?
  For example searching for <strong>arial</strong> gives: <strong>Your search yielded
  no results</strong>, which I think is weird since there must be at least something
  about arial in the forums.\r\n\r\nSo is the search not working or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nBtw.
  this site is awesome, I love the knowledge some of the guys here have!"

    instead.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nArial+site:typophile.com\r\n\r\nThis will restrict
    google to search within the Typophile website."

    This seems like a new bug -- I used to get satisfactory search results in the
    past, now usually zero results.\r\n\r\nIs there a fix in the works? Relying on
    Google's cached search seems a bit of a kluge."

    Apologies for leaving it broken for so long. Some bugs are more tenacious than
    others.\r\n"
