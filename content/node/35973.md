    typeface with your client. Except your client is a grafic designer, also ;)

  body: "I think that Thomas means that it is best to show a real specimen to a client
    when discussing font choices, rather than the less extensive catalogue entry in
    the [extremely good] FontBook. FontShop Berlin has quite hefty PDF specimens for
    [at least some] of the FF families available for download. These help convince
    clients much more.\r\n\r\nAlso, one may try contacting the foundry directly. Even
    if the foundry in question does not distribute fonts to designers for test purposes
    (many do if you ask a detailed, specific question, BTW), they may be willing to
    set some sample text from you or the client into a PDF for you."

    I wonder, does its three volumes now outweigh FontBook?"

    \r\n\r\nTell me about it! I was hoping to buy one at Typecon and carry it home,
    but they sold out before I got around to my bookstore purchases."

    ones hat Pantone uses. This might be the thing you're after? Even though I'm not
    too excited about the overall selection (yes Copperplate etc is included), it
    gives the client a hunch about the end result.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thameshudson.co.uk/books/Type_Selector/9780500241363.mxs/20/11/"

    and no doubt would be a great investment for years to come, though will take some
    time to look through all these options and i'm sure i will get sorted with all

    is a great and current catalogue of type from many of the foremost foundries in
    the world.\r\n\r\nOther good catalogues to compliment may be:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2646/typefacecatalogaz.html\">Linotype</a>
    has a new hardcover catalogue that contains their own as well as some Adobe and
    ITC faces.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/books/\">Font Bureau</a>
    has a nice hardcover of their fonts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/type/\">Veer</a>
    had some nice font only specimens published in '04 and '05 but those may not be
    available any longer. But, if you are not already, you should get on their mailing
    list to get any future type mailings.\r\n\r\nAdobe has their Adobe Type Library
    Reference Book, which contains all Adobe fonts.\r\n\r\nAnd of course the Indie
    Fonts series of books.\r\n\r\n"
