body: This was found on old University signage at the University of Minnesota. It
  looked hand painted so it may not be a specific font but perhaps it was based on
  one.

  body: It's a perfect example of a signwriter's "[[http://new.myfonts.com/search/gaspipe/fonts/|gaspipe"]]
    or "stove pipe" lettering. Not based on a typeface but based on a simple, modular
    grid. I love the wonkiness here. That H is far too narrow.
