body: Hello, first post here. I did a search but couldn&#39;t find any information
  on my interest. <BR> <BR>First off let me say that I am not a type wiz and cannot
  name ID a font like most of you can. I just don&#39;t have the eyes or education
  for it. That being said I have quite a few fonts and use Suitcase to activate and
  browse them. And I find the process terribly limiting and time consuming. I have
  specific needs when looking for the font and would like the ability to sort fonts
  in a program by sans, serif, illustrative, script, blackletter or choose a font
  and have the program show me fonts in a similar style etc.  <BR> <BR>First question
  is there a system like this in place built into the font standard to tag the file
  with characteristics like an mp3 file? <BR>Why not? &#40;if applicable&#41; <BR>
  <BR>Second question. What are your thoughts on this idea? Not everyone has the depth
  of knowledge of fonts but many people know what they are looking for and currently
  searching alphabetically or via foundry is not efficient. True I can go to a foundry
  and search their particular fonts that way but once they reach my computer they
  become unsorted. A user/consumer shouldn&#39;t be forced to create a filing system
  that should be built into the files themselves. <BR> <BR>Thankyou.

  body: I like your idea of a tagging scheme like mp3 files.  <BR> <BR>There does
    exist something like this for fonts called the Panose System. It&#39;s rather
    rigorous with one of its goals to enable similar fonts to be substituted when
    the specified font is missing. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not well supported. I think
    PageMaker used it, but I don&#39;t know of other apps that do. Also, not all font
    vendors use it. And a Panose number by itself is not very user-friendly--2053700203
    vs. Geometric Sans Serif for instance. <BR> <BR>In FontLab, there is something
    called &#34;IBM Class&#34; and &#34;IBM Subclass&#34; which would seem to be closer
    to what you suggest, but I don&#39;t know how much it&#39;s supported. <BR> <BR>The
    whole idea of tagging fonts with keywords is even disliked by some font vendors
    because it &#34;pigeonholes&#34; a font and might artificially limit its exposure
    to customers on, say, a font vending site.

  body: I&#39;m told that Font Reserve and Suitcase X1 &#40;I use Suitcase 9&#41;
    have something similar but I think it uses some sort of pre established database
    rather than reading the files and creating one from them.

  body: Yeah, I was going to mention that, too. I don&#39;t know where their information
    comes from. I think it&#39;s hard-coded into the program&#39;s database rather
    than being drawn from the fonts, sort of like a spelliing dictionary in that you
    can add your own info to it.

  body: The main problem with Panose is that it is designed for font matching, not
    for the ways people think about font categories. <BR> <BR>Font Reserve&#39;s database
    is a hard-coded list of font family names and corresponding classifications, originally
    developed by me around 1995-96, before I went to Adobe. They have added somewhat
    to it over the years. I think it works reasonably well. The idea is not that it
    could ever be complete, but it can get probably 70-90% of the average professional
    user&#39;s fonts classified, and if they want to classify the rest, they can.
    Essentially a big &#34;leg up&#34; on organizing your fonts. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR> <BR>T

    that Font Reserve has it, but wouldn&#39;t it be possible to have something like
    this available online like the CDDB so any and all programs that deal with fonts
    could take advantage of it? It doesn&#39;t seem like it would take long to build
    up such a database if it was done the same way CDDB was done &#40;i.e., by users&#41;.

    I&#39;ve been building for a  <BR>few years. The creation of its web face is just
    now underway.

    This would be one possible aspect of the database. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Thomas: It&#39;s good to have the insight of your experience. <BR> <BR>My
    thinking is that the databse while good is most effective for established font
    families. While many newer fonts may not be included within the software DB. If
    the files themselves contained the necessary information it would make the list
    much more relevant and up to date and allow a greater usability of the fonts on
    your system. Not only could one search for serif but the underlying characteristic
    of an italic swash version. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using an older version of Suitcase
    &#40;ver. 9&#41; and should try either Font Reserve or X1 to see how well the
    sorting is before taking this further, but I think the idea is valid and should
    think of expanding the standard to include the use of meta data within a font
    file.'

  body: In terms of what will work in a font management app, I agree that it would
    be ideal if there were a useful, standard system that newer fonts used, and that
    older fonts were pre-classified by the application according to the same system.
    The IBM system would probably be fairly workable for such a purpose, while Panose
    would not &#40;as noted above&#41;. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T
