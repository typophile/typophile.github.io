  using this odd, spacey display font. They found it 'somewhere online' (i.e. nobody
  knows where) and only have this image of the upper case character set to work with.\r\n\r\n<img

  anyone help point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\nAnother clue - the font in use
  in the site logo:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.melesmeles.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/badger_logo_400.png\">\r\n\r\nAny
  tips or help much appreciated.\r\n\r\nDerry"

    but there is another one inspired by the same sources (http://www.behance.net/gallery/Pixa-Type-Family/4508745)."
