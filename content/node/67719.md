  body: It's probably custom. It looks like the work of Identikal who has created
    custom fonts for Dazed & Confused in the past.

    like the mag!\r\nWe're changing design teams so March issue will be the last use
    for this typeface.\r\n\r\n(1)\r\nThe font is called <strong>Dazedface</strong>,
    and was used in editorial features, fashion stories and covers. (The example jpg
    is an editorial opener).\r\n\r\n(2)\r\nDesigned and built inhouse by me.\r\n\r\n(3)\r\nIt's
    currently not distributed, but we might look into foundries if anyone is interested.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nAgata
    Wycichowska\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
