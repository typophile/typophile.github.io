body: Major apologies in advance for not having sample images, but everything I could
  find online was in a different typeface. I'm wondering what typeface was used for
  the opening titles of Cronenberg's <em>Eastern Promises</em>. It's similar to Futura
  Display or the solid version of [[http://www.fontdiner.com/menu_lunch.html|Font
  Diner's Milwaukee]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/liquorstore/|Liquor Store]],
  but more geometric than the first and more polished than the last two, plus it had
  a number of weights. I know that's not much to go on, but hopefully somebody has
  seen the film and knows what I'm talking about?

    I think <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/solano-gothic/?refby=typographica">Solano</a>
    is too new.

  body: '[[http://www.myfonts.com/FontAlbums/AlbumDetail?aid=214470|Here''s another
    list]], linked in that Flickr comment thread. Of all of these, I think that Liquor
    Store is still the closest, but that can''t be it because it only has one weight.
    Unfortunately, I saw the film a week ago so I can''t picture it as clearly as
    I''d like. Thanks for the useful pointer, though!'

    Probably customized for the movie.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/compacta/\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq_M8EOC4zA\r\n\r\nMikey

  body: Thanks. The face they used was quite a bit more "square," so I don't think
    that's it. But again, thanks for the useful links.
