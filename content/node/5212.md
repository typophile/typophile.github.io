  body: 'FontFonts did quite well, in what was mainly a national &#40;pre-Internet&#41;
    direct-mail marketing era.  <BR>They had good branding, well designed printed
    specimens, plus Fuse and the FontBook. <BR>And the FontShop stores. <BR> <BR>Their
    classics are Scala, Meta, Dax, &amp; Quadraat. DIN could be included, although
    that was designed in the 1930s originally. <BR>Maybe classic: Fontesque &#40;still
    selling well&#41;. <BR>More ephemeral: Blur, Trixie, Dot Matrix, Mambo, &amp;
    the &#34;Instant Types&#34;. <BR>'

  body: Dave Farey designed Beeknees, not my favourite.  Also he designed Bodoni 175B
    Bold for Lanston. <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/BodoniBold.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/BodoniBold.html</a>
    <BR>You might notice he included small caps. They come with both &#34;French&#34;
    oldstyle and lining figures. Rather unusual.  This face works with the Bodoni
    175 designed by Sol Hess for Lanston which also has the &#34;French&#34; oldstyle
    figures. <a href="http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>I might add David&#39;s pencil quality is not even second to a robot.
    <BR> <BR>He is a remarkable man with an exacto blade. His earlier works were cut
    in amberlith. I have heard he now is consulting for the &#34;London Times&#34;.
    Does anyone happen to have a current e-mail address for him? Or phone number?

  body: Anything by Jens Gehlhaar was superb, and still is. the best work he did was
    after the Apply design releases. Barnbrook&#39;s work was also amazing and a trend
    setter.
