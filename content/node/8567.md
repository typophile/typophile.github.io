  this font &#40;see below&#41; was a Benguiat family, but I still can&#39;t identify
  what font it is.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62617.jpg"

    The S is flipped, Its been condensed and it looks like some photoshop hell has
    been applied. If you are good with photoshop I would guess you could make this
    in about 10 minutes.
