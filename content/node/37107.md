  body: "Many of the most popular typefaces used for books in American publishing
    in the 1950s were Linotype. \r\n\r\nIn his column, \"The Pi Channel,\" in the
    January 6, 1958 issue of <cite>Publishers' Weekly,</cite> Paul Bennett (who, it
    should be noted, was on the marketing staff with Mergenthaler Linotype) touted
    the presence of Linotype faces in the AIGA Fifty: \"The total score for Linotype
    in the Fifty since 1946 is, in fact, a whopping two-thirds of the exhibit -- 394
    of the 600 honored selections.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the stats Bennett cites:\r\n\r\n\"By
    far the most popular were two fine transitional types: the contemporary Caledonia,
    designed by Dwiggins, and the classic Baskerville. It's interesting to note that
    though Linotype Baskerville has been available ten years longer than Caledonia,
    the latter was used for seven more books: 72 to 65.\r\n\r\n\"Among the preferred
    old styles, the ranking is Janson, Granjon and Times Roman. TR is the youngster
    here, being available just ten years -- yet it was used for nineteen books. The
    others: historic and classic Janson for 57 books; and the compact, space-thrifty
    Granjon, 35.\r\n\r\n\"Seemingly, there are but two moderns that are really accepted
    by our better bookmakers: the Dwiggins-designed Electra, and the lighter rendering
    of Bodoni's historic letter, Bodoni Book. Electra, though available eighteen years
    later than Bodoni Book, outscored the latter, 33 to 25.\"\r\n\r\nAs Nick cautions,
    however, the current digital versions of Caledonia and Electra are sadly lacking
    in the vitality of the originals and no longer well-suited for book text work,
    in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIf you're trying for 1950s facsimile, I'd probably try a
    Baskerville or Linotype Janson Text.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    artefacts of the letterpress process, which in my opinion are a necessary part
    of historical ambience. Electra was an elegant face, but it nonetheless had a
    robust quality when set -- particularly apparent at this large (12pt) size, on
    uncoated stock with a bit of texture and some ink spread.\r\nThe digital version
    is fine and slick, which is a different effect, and may be useful today -- but
    I don't think it captures the old mood.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WarholPage_4994.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Warhol2_6044.jpg]\r\nIn

  body: "Aside from any difference in contrast (which was debated at length in that
    other thread), another thing that strikes me about the comparison of digital Electra
    with the original is the difference in some character widths. Granted, these are
    pretty subtle; but the cumulative effect is noticeable.\r\n\r\nMetal Linotype
    had no unitized width constraints (just the duplexing constraint on paired roman
    and italic, or roman and bold). However, the earliest Linofilm photocomposition
    machines adopted an 18-unit system. This was partly a mechanical requirement,
    due to a constant drive motor. I believe the decision to divide the em into 18
    units was influenced by the Monotype's 18-unit system. Later, with the advent
    of the Linotype V-I-P, a stepping motor allowed a more refined system and the
    constraint was changed to a 54-unit system for advance widths. \r\n\r\nI contend
    that, in the evolution from metal to photocomposition, designs like Electra and
    Caledonia were adapted to the unitized systems, and that these versions were then
    the sources for the digitizations now available. If one examines the l.c. character
    widths in digital Electra, for instance, it can be seen that they correspond neatly
    to 54-unit increments:\r\n\r\nf i j l t = 278 (15 units)\r\nr s = 333 (18)\r\nv
    x y = 426 (23)\r\na = 444 (24)\r\nc e g k = 463 (25)\r\no = 500 (27)\r\nb d p
    q = 519 (28)\r\nh n u = 556 (30)\r\nw = 667 (36)\r\nm = 833 (45)\r\n\r\nI did
    not analyze the capitals, but I'm sure you'd find more of the same. This unitization
    would account for the difference in rhythm between texts set in digital Electra
    compared to the original.\r\n\r\nOf course, this subtle difference in character
    widths is not what leads me to assert that the face is no longer suited to book
    text -- that would come primarily from the spindly contrast (and the fact that
    a relatively large master was probably used). But this difference in rhythm is
    part of my disappointment in digital Electra compared with the original design.\r\n\r\n--
    K.\r\n\r\n"
