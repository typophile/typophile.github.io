  body: Basic beginner question. What is Urbana used for? Where would it be used?
    Is this a text font?

  body: Interesting, I did a search for "Urbana" and only got a mention of the Champaign/Urbana
    area of Illinois. Is there a better way to search than the search box at the top
    of this page?

  body: J., I tightened the kerning and made the semi-bold into a friendly word mark
    for a logo. I could see it being used for other marketing and identity work.
