body: "I've found a few threads on this topic, but none from the recent past; I'm
  hoping things might have changed since then (perhaps in CS4, which I'm less familiar
  with)\u2026\r\n\r\nIn InDesign, is there any smart (i.e. truly automatic) way to
  indent the first line in all but the first paragraph? To date, I've simply been
  making a separate child paragraph style named \"First paragraph\" or something like
  that, but it'd be so much easier if there were some way that wouldn't require me
  to change each instance by hand.\r\n\r\nI've looked through the InDesign help files,
  and I'm aware of the \"Next Style\" feature, but \u2014 unless you use InDesign
  as your word processor, which I don't \u2014 it still requires selecting text and
  applying the changes by hand.\r\n\r\nBasically I'm looking for the InDesign equivalent
  of CSS <a href=\"http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Blocks_and_Paragraphs/2.3.2/\">adjacent
  sibling selectors</a>.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the \"Next Style\" function exists (which
  is close but no cigar) makes me guess that there isn't anything better, but please
  correct me if I'm wrong."

    to CS4; they do 'contextual character styling', so there is yet hope for the future."

  body: "Thanks for confirming; I was afraid that was the answer I would get. It always
    seemed funny to me that, despite the obvious limitations of web typography, there
    are also instances where it exceeds print. Another such example is with em-based
    linespacing.\r\n\r\nThe GREP styles are promising though. We'll see what happens
    in CS5."

  body: "Next Styles isn't really automatic in the same way adjacent sibling selectors
    are\u2026 it still requires you to apply the changes by hand. Given, it can do
    a large number of changes in one fell swoop, but it does require some kind of
    preceding paragraph style. It's essentially a glorified find/replace."

  body: "As it happens, yesterday I wrote a javascript to apply styles with first/next
    settings. All you have to do is change the style names in the script and run it
    in your story. The script is at [[http://forums.adobe.com/message/2303467]]\r\n\r\n(As
    an aside, typing this I remembered I didn't properly test it. So I just did. And,
    surely, it did sth weird ... oughta be fixed now.)"
