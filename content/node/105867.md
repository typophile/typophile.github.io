body: "Hello,\r\nI want to buy a full family of Futura that includes multiple weights
  and ideally small caps/old-style numerals.\r\nI'm leaning towards Berthold's Futura
  Pro, but I know there are several options available from other companies/designers
  -- does anyone have advice as to what the strengths/weaknesses are?\r\nI know this
  topic was dealt with in a thread from 2006, which I did read, but I thought possibly
  more options or information would be available now.\r\nThanks for any thoughts you
  have.\r\n"

  body: I have been curious about those Neufville Futura releases for a long while,
    obviously they have looked intriguing, looking at samples, but has anyone actually
    used them with any success?

  body: "Thanks for the advice... the Futura ND family does look beautiful and extremely
    well drawn from what I can see on myfonts.com. \r\nAfter comparing it to Berthold's
    Futura Pro, it does seem like ND's version is slightly superior... more sophisticated
    or nuanced.\r\nIf anyone has other opinions, I'd appreciate hearing them.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    also costs less than Bertold's"
