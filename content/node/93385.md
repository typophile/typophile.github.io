  I need some research help.\r\n\r\nI started a new job a few weeks ago, an in-house
  job with an online glasses retailer. They're in the middle of re-branding, and they
  say they hired me to push it to a more fashion-forward, couture look. Well, they're
  far enough into the redesign that they're already set on a logo, typefaces and colors.
  I think I can live with all the choices they've made so far except the typefaces.
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glasses_typography-01_4878.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  fine with Chalet and Museo. But Filosofia? Don't get me wrong, I think it's beautiful,
  but when I see it I think of book covers from the late 90s/early 00s. Especially
  since they like to use the unicase. Anyone ever see it used in a \"fashion-forward\"
  way? Can you show me something that will make me fall in love with it?\r\n\r\nI
  think I'm going to bring up my concerns with the CD, but I want to make sure I'm
  well versed in Filosofia before I put my thoughts out there. Thanks!"

    a statement, like couture does. And if Analisa is more comfortable with Chalet
    and Museo than Filosofia, then I'm assuming it's not <em>haute</em> couture.\r\n\r\nCouture

  body: "Nick, I agree that usually Didone faces connote fashion, but Filosofia seems
    to be an exception for me. Maybe it's just a personal association\u2014that's
    why I was wondering if anyone has ever actually seen it used in a fashion context.
    It also could be, as Hrant suggested, that it's simply dated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/didot_vs_filo-02_4403.jpg]\r\n\r\nHrant,
    I'm actually liking your suggestion of Ernestine. We could even replace Museo
    with it as well\u2014I think having 3 corporate typefaces is overkill anyway.
    I wish there was at least one thinner weight, though.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ernestine_4155.png]\r\n\r\nLike
    you mentioned, we're not necessarily haute couture. Some of the higher end brands
    we carry are OGI, Derek Lam, Guess, Oakley. Some of the lower are Smith Optics,
    Ernest Hemingway. So there's a pretty broad range of styles.\r\n\r\nDavid, I would
    like to see something more own-able as well. I think especially the use of Chalet
    is running on the safe side. But maybe pairing it with one more unique face will
    help that.\r\n\r\nNo takers on the \"make me love Filosofia\" request?"

  body: "<em>Filosofia seems to be an exception for me.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, while the
    didone style says fashion, it has to be clean cut (rich?) and the hairlines can
    never be too thin; with its interpretive serif treatment Filoso\uFB01a is a little
    too post-modern.\r\n\r\nM/M redesigned <em>Interview</em> a couple of years ago
    using Scotch Modern, but I\u2019m afraid it looked a little too academic for Fabien
    Baron, and was promptly abandoned.\r\n\r\nITC Bodoni is another didone that incorporates
    the trace of letterpress process, again not \uFB01nding much favor as a fashion
    face.\r\n\r\n"
