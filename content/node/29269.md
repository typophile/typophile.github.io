  body: "So far I have confirmed in the 'Homage to the Alphabet' book that this is
    'Modula Extra Bold'. I have also found that Opti Fonts had this under the name
    of Ogden, but I can't find it online. A lighter weight (bold?) was once distrbuted
    by NovelFonts under the name of Obbsidda.\r\n\r\nThat's all I have been able to
    find through my notes. Maybe Mike F. has more info on digital versions?\r\n\r\n-

    I know of no digital version.

  body: "As a matter of fact, Mike ...\r\n\r\nOther digital versions of Modula XB
    that I'm aware of are:\r\n\r\n1) <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Kasse FLF</a> from the defunct Casady & Greene folks. The download
    includes equivalents to Modula Light, Bold and XB (there was a medium weight to
    Modula too).\r\n\r\n2) <a href=\"http://fontsfordesign.com/previews/modular.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Modularity</a> from <a href=\"http://fontsfordesign.com/preview.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Doug Olena/Keystrokes</a>.\r\n\r\nNeither matches the image
    exactly, but it's the image's characters that have been altered from Modula -
    especially the c and C - not the fonts.\r\n\r\nOh, and <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Castcraft</a> likely still will sell you their version, but
    their customer service, er, lacks enthusiam, shall we say?"
