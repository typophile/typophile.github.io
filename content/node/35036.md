  on the web. What are the main technical issues with using them on the web in a UTF-8
  document?\r\n\r\nThe main issue\u2014that I have found\u2014with ligatures on the
  web is lack of search engine support. A search engine such as Google does not understand
  that \u2018[[http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%EF%AC%81nd&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8|\uFB01nd]]\u2019
  and \u2018[[http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=find&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8|find]]\u2019
  means the same."

  body: Sounds like a similar problem with old PS1 typefaces using the ligatures and
    causing havoc with spell check.

    if browsers and CSS supported simply turning ligatures on via formatting and then
    handled it at the glyph display level it wouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
