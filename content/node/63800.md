  noticed that the biker gang Hells Angels use a split serif font on their vests.
  \r\n\r\nIn which ways have you seen this unlikely kind of serif used?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your feedback,\r\nWilliam"

  body: "Hi, \r\nI used a split serif in a headline for an article about \"split personalities\"...
    a bit obvious perhabs but still nice. It was some years ago and teh original document
    is gone, so unfortunately I don't have the name of the font. It looks a bit like
    \"Tuscandy\" under the myfont selection above though.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DT13person_3887.jpg]"

  body: "Great replies, thanks everybody.\r\n\r\nKarinskij, I'm pretty sure it is
    the face Tuscandy - I took it to what the font - and what a lovely spread you
    made with it. Dojr, retiro is an interesting face too, lots of things happening
    but still remaining on the useful side. Bitstream arrus looks like you might be
    able to set running text with it.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day."

  body: You could possibly look up western- or circus- style. Most of these I could
    say, based on what I see, have this old western or circus entertainment feel,
    so you could probably google these terms and see if you come up with any more
    hits
