    It's a free font management application.\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX\r\n\r\nJust
    download and copy to your applications directory. After that start up the program
    (just double click), then you can drag and drop the font files into the application
    window and that should do the trick for you.\r\nWhen you then start any application
    (illustrator, indesign) you will find the font in the font list of the application.\r\n\r\ngood
    luck.\r\ndav2."

    folder with the font files (and, normally, some other files like the EULA etc.)
    I assume you are on Mac OSX? Then just doubleclick the zip file.\r\n\r\n2. The
    font has to be activated, so that applications can use it. If you don\u2019t have
    a lot of fonts, the easiest way is to move the files to your Fonts folder (<em>Your-User-Name
    </em>/Library/Fonts)\r\n\r\n<cite>mac post script is that right?</cite>\r\n\r\nDepends.
    But (still assuming you\u2019re on Mac OSX, that is) that should work just fine.\r\n\r\nF"
