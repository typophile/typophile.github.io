  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I had my first class last Thursday.
It went pretty well. The students found the exercise challenging 
which I was happy about since that meant they were thinking 
about what they were doing.</p>
<p>The exercise was based on typographic systems, 
exploring composition of space and possibilities 
of expression (value, rhythm …)
They had 5 black lines that they used to make 
a composition in a square base on priciples of symmetry, 
asymmetry, intermittence, interruption.</p>
<p>Most of the student came up with some good solutions.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any experience in the teaching field. 
Maybe you can give me some tips about giving the students as much knowledge and experience as possible in a 3hr class.</p>
<p>thanks
p.S this is an intro to typo class</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I taught a level 2 typography class last semester, which was challenging but also very rewarding.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the students learned best when lectures were kept to a minimum and activity was at a maximum. I kept them busy as much as possible so their minds were focused and not bored to death by me explaining the differences between a bowl and a counter. I created hand-outs that briefly explained things they needed to know, and then let them do their thing. I encouraged them to talk and socialize, since design is a social medium.</p>
<p>At the end of the class, some really began to appreciate typography, and others were just happy to make it through to the end.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I just finished my design degree, and the memorable and useful projects I did in typography classes were about how to utilize hierarchy in design. Which is sooooo important. Also I likes the expressive type projects where we got to design posters of song lyrics done only in type, and write words in ketchup and stuff like that.</div>
