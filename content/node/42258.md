body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a dense, very Excel-looking reporting project that is auto-generated
  into a pdf for screen and crappy printer use.  For the text labels, which are typically
  all caps (not even small caps), I'm looking at using Calibri (or: Verdana, Trebuchet,
  Orator).\r\n\r\nMost of the report is taken up by numeral blocks filling the resulting
  grid cells.  They'd be at most 3 characters (0.00) and have a color coding scheme
  ranging 30%-90% gray, but usually at about 50%.  Not every cell is filled, ranging
  from 30% - 90% filled, depending on the report (the sparser ones are naturally easier
  on the eyes).  The attached [[http://typophile/files/matrix.gif |image]] is an approximation.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would be a good, legible font for the numerals?  \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nJulie"
