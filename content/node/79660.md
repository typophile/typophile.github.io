  ink traps, and whether or not it is commercially available. The handbag in the picture
  is part of the spread.\r\n\r\nI somehow don't think this style of ink trap is performance
  oriented, as -- at least to me -- it seems to recollect more ornate antique or tuscan
  forms. I think it's for display, rather than for small sizes in a directory. But
  I could be wrong, I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "Thanks Marc.\r\n\r\nThose are quite nice. I'm sure certain typographers/type
    designers would cringe to see such things used at display sizes for which they
    are not intended. But that's not to say we can't try something new.\r\n\r\nI was
    thinking to mix a type like in the NYT magazine with Psuedo* as a body text face.\r\n\r\nThis
    treatment is no crystal goblet, that's for sure. Plus it is a mixing of like with
    like, which may or may not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Psuedo, by Michael Hernan. See
    attached. I have permission to use it, but not commercially.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/psuedo_heart_3831.jpg]"
