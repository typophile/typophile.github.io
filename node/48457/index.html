<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
i've got to design a brochure about an urbanism workshop that will take place in China. In fact, there will be three versions: a French, an English and a Chinese version (combined with a bit of English text). The porblem is: I know NOTHING about Chinese typography. I did read the following threads but I'm just more confuse than I was…
http://www.typophile.com/node/40032
http://www.typophile.com/node/47267
http://www.typophile.com/node/19200
http://www.typophile.com/node/38166
http://www.typophile.com/node/42433
So, basically, can you guide me about choosing a good chinese font (I don't know yet if the text will be set in traditional or simplified version). I'm in the early stage of the design so I don't really know what I'm looking for, but as I understand it, I'll have to work with the font that'll work best technically with a short squedule (must be send to print on monday, 25!!!). A formal clue: there'll probably be some [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_gridnik/gridnik.html|gridnik]] or [[http://www.lineto.com|simple]] in the layout.
Is there Chinese typographic "rules" that I must know?
Is there technical issues that I should be aware of (I'm using InDesign Cs3 on 10.5.4)?
Everything else that you judge important…
Please remember that I'm a newbie about chinese type so if your answer could be short and consise, I'll appreciate! It would probably not be possible, but…
Thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Alexandre, I'm Chinese, maybe I can help you on choosing the font? Most Chinese fonts released by large foundries support both simplified and traditional, so don't worry about it. I remember some Chinese fonts that may convey the sense you want with gridnik.
As long as you are using a Chinese font, there shouldn't any problem in InDesign, plus mac has very good support for asian languages.
Also you might want to be careful about the leading.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In wich way should I care about the leading? I though that Chinese was writing in vertical. See, I really know nothing about it.
Also if you can give me some names of fonts (or which aspect of the design of the font should I take a closer look to) and maby some references about how to deal with chinese type (in English or in French), I'll appreciate… </div>

<div class=commentbody>Simplified Chinese reads exactly like English, but Traditional Chinese reads from top to bottom and then from right to left, therefore some punctuation in Traditional Chinese are different, like quotes/double quotes. You said the workshop will take place in China? If mainland China then Simplified, if not then Traditional.
I can't really give you the names because they are all in Chinese and PinYin doesn't really make any sense. You can take a look [[http://www.font.com.cn/downlist/s_12_1.html|here]], or just go [[http://www.foundertype.com.cn/agentmodel/NetEasyIndex.aspx?charset=ALL&FontUse=%D5%FD%CE%C4%D7%D6|here]], it's one of the most famous type foundries in China. Unfortunately I don't have any English articles that I know of that deal with Chinese type.</div>

That's a clip from a hong kong newspaper, set in traditional chinese but reads like you read english. I forgot to mention that the special way of reading (top to bottom, right to left) is generally used in books (for long text), but not for web. It's just a cultural thing...
Also there is no such thing as hyphen/hyphenation in chinese, but we do use dash. There is also a special punctuation that english doesn't have and it's in the picture.
btw...can a forum moderator delete those repeating posts?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Marica -- just curious. I don't often typeset Chinese, but it fascinates me.
The essence of the punctuation is that they have the same width as the regular characters, isn't it? Just as the monospace latin characters are. I also notice halfwidth characters (the Latin words and numerals), how about those? Should the visual 'grid' realign after these? Your image appears to be justified. And I noticed the first line indents precisely one square :-)
I see an en-dash <em>and</em> -- 8th line -- a "number one" character. Are those different enough? :-)
I've seen punctuation in two different styles: either left-aligned in the character square, or centered, as your example shows. But I can't find the special punctuation character you mention.
A last question: Chinese doesn't use hyphenation, but some phrases can only be understood correctly in character pairs, isn't it? Does that bother anyone when reading?
Hope the storm doesn't get any worse -- I'll keep an eye on CNN for ya.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>In traditional chinese, punctuation and characters share the same width, because this makes things easier for setting text in both ways. In simplified chinese, the width of punctuation varies, because it's only set in one way, and they are left-aligned.
There is no dash in the picture....it's "one". An em-dash is twice as long as that, and there is no en-dash.
Character pairs... ;-) There are some hilarious jokes derived from incorrectly paired characters, but no it doesn't really matter that much.
I'm not an expert on mixing chinese and english together, but I usually just decide leading based on chinese and justify english later on. I try to avoid mixing them up mostly, because english words breaks up the "rhythm", in other words it interrupts the reading.</div>
