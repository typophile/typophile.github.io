    course neither of these is really satisfactory! Yes, they have the \"sigma\" E,
    and some of the streamlined feel, but little else. The R seems closer to Gill
    Sans or Humanist 521. And the B reminds me of Savigny. I wonder if this was based
    on a single typeface, or is a deft combination.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/gill-sans/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/humanist-521/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/savigny/\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I just sent the question to Mark Sloan, the designer, who is based in Amsterdam.
    If he answers it, I'll post it here. "

    the logo, Mark Sloan, of Anomaly, in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\"Hi Skylar, thanks for
    the kind words.. I really appreciate it! It was hand-drawn, just sketched out
    and then traced in Illustrator.\"\r\n\r\nBwahahahaHAHAHA! (Joke's on me.)"

  body: "Hi skyfein, \r\n\r\nSorry for my late reply, I was out of the town yesterday.
    \r\nTank you very much for all these informations.\r\nAll fonts mentioned have
    similar features to the original design. \r\nI'm gonna see if I can catch what
    I want from it.\r\n\r\nIt's an amazing design from Mark, especially if it's hand
    written. \r\nBig up !\r\n\r\nHave a good one \r\n\r\nCheers"
