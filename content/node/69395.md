    \ No,  that's what you mostly use this site for. Nothing wrong with that though
    I guess? \r\n\r\nI prefer to happen to find stuff out for myself and/or create
    stuff that doesn't already exist.\r\nBut - I also like the font you have found
    - please post here what you do along these lines."
