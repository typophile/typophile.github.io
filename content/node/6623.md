body: I have always gone with &#34;less is more&#34; when it comes to the number of
  fonts used on a website.  Somewhere in one of my books there is a &#34;rule of thumb&#34;
  that would be helpful if I could locate it but it seems to escape my attempts ...
  would you be so kind to share your knowledge and expertise on the number of fonts
  used and why less is more. <BR>Thanks, linda

  body: I think there is more or less a &#40; typo graphic &#41; rule, that one shall
    not use more than three &#40; 3 &#41; different typefaces on one page, in print..
    <i>&#40; This should work very well, for websites too.. &#41;</i> <BR> <BR>Well,
    I also think I prefer &#39;Less is more&#39; related to typography usage on sceen
    as well as off screen.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: The difficulty of making good design increases exponentially with the number
    of fonts used. So to me it&#39;s not that you have to use few fonts&#42;, it&#39;s
    that you have to know your limits. We see few good designs that use many fonts
    not because there&#39;s something inherently wrong with that, but because there
    are very few people who can pull it off, and almost as few projects that benefit
    from it. <BR> <BR>&#42; That&#39;s too Modernist, too simple. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I guess I have always wondered when it was that a &#34;Rule of Thumb&#34;
    mutates into &#34;Rule of Thumbscrew.&#34; It is easy to forget what brought the
    &#34;rule&#34; into being and remember only the rigid absolute number.  Rules
    of thumb are perhaps meant for those who are not yet capable of deciding out of
    experience and are in search of guidence.   <BR>A good designer can do a good
    job without any such &#34;rules.&#34; A bad designer or perhaps a non-designer
    would be lucky to achieve mediochre results using such rules as opposed to bad
    results without them. <BR>There is no &#34;number&#34;-- Let the problem speak
    to you and let your eyes be the judge.  The worst that can happen is that you
    made a bad design.  Don&#39;t worry, you would not be alone.  The world is filled
    with bad design. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Why use three when one will do? Every decent font that has stood the test
    of time has at least an italic and a bold, and a bold italic. Add another font
    only if and when you have exhausted all possibilities. It&#39;s about comprehension
    and legibility, which require restraint.
