  the tilde acutally works and if I can emulate/imitate the same key-behaviour in
  OTF substitution?\r\n\r\nI'm talking about the following fact:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
  Shot 2014-02-15 at 12_6568.33.55.png]\r\n\r\nI'm able to type <em>ALT-N</em> and
  create a \"selected\" Tilde. If I keep typing for instance an <em>a</em> I get an
  a-tilde character.\r\nHowever if I press the space-bar the Tilde is going to stay
  in place and I can go on with my typing.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to mimic this behaviour
  in OTF programming?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nSepp"

    Layout is glyph level processing that doesn't affect character strings, so you
    would end up displaying \xE3 or \xF1 but the text string behind them would be
    ~a and ~n."

  body: "Dear John,\r\n\r\nthank's for your answer: I know that the text-string behind
    it would be ~a and ~n and I'm fine with this.\r\nI'm working with this for a university
    project where this is totally ok.\r\n\r\nIs it technically possible to do this
    with OTF programming?\r\n\r\nE.g. sub degree p by pring; \r\nSo when I type the
    <em>degree</em> and a <em>p</em> I get a new character p with a ring above.\r\nI
    know that the underlying string would still be degree and p however it displays
    the thing I'm after.\r\n\r\nNow imagine i just want to type \xB0p side by side.
    I would need to be able to have the same mechanism like the tilde is having right
    now.\r\n\r\nIs that possible somehow?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nSepp88"

    I'd still be very interested in how to achieve this with OTF programming. Would
    you mind giving me a link or any direction how to do this?\r\n\r\nThank you in

  body: "There is no letter \"latin small letter p with a ring above\" in unicode.
    You can however get a p with a ring above when you type p followed by U+030A,
    \"combining ring above\" in Times New Roman, Calibri, Cambria etc. \r\n\r\nModifying
    an Austrian keyboard layout so that \xB0 becomes a dead key and so that when you
    type \xB0p side by side you get p followed by the combining ring above is quite
    easy. That means that with such a layout, you can type  \xB0p side by side and
    get p with a ring above in Times New Roman, Calibri etc. without ever modifying
    those fonts (which you are not allowed to do, anyway). That will work with any
    font that correctly handles combining diacritical marks.  Switching from one keyboard
    layout to another can be done quite fast (just typing command space for instance).
    I regularly switch between the US Extended and the Canadian French CSA keyboard
    layouts that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, what you want to do is certainly possible with OTL. I still think it's
    a bad idea, but the implementation is pretty easy. Most of what you'd do is simple
    ligature lookups e.g.\r\n\r\n<code>asciitilde n -> ntilde</code>\r\n\r\nFor any
    sequence not covered in the ligature lookup, you'd get ~ followed by whatever
    came next.\r\n\r\nIn the special case where you want to display '~n' instead of
    '\xF1', you could easily mimic the deadkey keyboard behaviour, using a contextual
    ligation lookup that removes the space glyph when '~ ' is followed by any of the
    letters in the first ligature lookup coverage, e.g.\r\n\r\n<code>asciitilde space
    -> asciitilde\r\n| n etc.</code>\r\n\r\n[Note that I've used VOLT lookup syntax
    here. If you're using an AFDKO-based tool for OTL programming, you'll need to
    translate this into the appropriate syntax.]\r\n"

  body: Matthias, I have my MacBook keyboard completely customized with Ukelele to
    make typing easier. The app is not hard to learn, but I consider its documentation
    a bit confusing. If you face any trouble, fell free to contact me.
