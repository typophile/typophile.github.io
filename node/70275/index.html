This is still rough. It's also going to be paired with a wordmark, which I'm omitting here at the moment. 

I'd love to hear how this reads, what you see, and/or what ideas you get about the company/service offered. 
Also, is it close to something else that's already out there?

It's an ("A"-initialled) IT consulting/support/software-engineering company; however they're not so wild on something with primarily a slick «new tech» aesthetic but rather want something that radiates their values – diligence, stability, hard-working no-frills trustworthiness and such, which is why I tried to find something *very* stable/solid plus work in a second layer of meaning (with the arrow). Has a very stable sort of «PROGRESS» feel to me if that makes any sense. 
I hope the arrow thing is not perceived too much as graphic-designer silliness; that it reads as cursor-like to some is great to hear.

Regarding being close to other stuff: Sebastian, Tailored Values is really quite nice. I agree the concept is similar, but would you agree it's different enough in style/execution? Does it bother you if I go ahead with this?
BACKUP: has an actual "V" (or upside-down "A") no? BVCKUP, I remember that spurring quite a discussion. [Edit: Thanks for the link Riccardo, interesting!]
Altoona curve I think is far enough removed for me in terms of design as well as what it is. As well as geographically.</div>

This may be a non-issue, but I thought it might be worth to keep in mind.

As a side note, an alternative to giving cues is to have the image be nonsensical when something recognizable is expected, thus forcing the observer to cycle through alternative modes of observation in order to try to make sense of the image. Obviously, this won't work here, since logotypes are expected to be abstract.</div>

Also it looks like an uppercase lambda, which is L, not A. I do like the shape of it quite a lot, I think it's marginally more memorable that the original.

@nina - perhaps extend the outer parts of serifs a bit? This should make the actual "footing" concept more prominent. Looks very nice otherwise, though I would never guessed it was for an IT company.</div>

It needs a personal touch to push it in that direction. Right now, the cursor idea is not clear enough to stand out. I'd consider experimenting with an illustrative/curvilinear element that takes the place of the crossbar or intersects with the form. Perhaps something that sparks the idea of collaboration, reaching out, etc. A sun, star, swoosh, etc.</div>

Either you've just "stolen" a job from another designer, or, that designer steals your work? They can't take credit for it legally, and the sure as hell would be crazy to put it in their portfolio. 

Even if the client doesn't see it, NO WAY I'd submit somebody else's work to my client. It's unethical. So, even if your solution is REALLY great...I can't use it. If you had described it rather than drawn it, I could have made the design myself. And for that, yes, I'd be grateful.  

Imagine somebody walked into Picasso's studio midway through a painting and picked up his brush? Then paints over half his painting? Hubris? You bet! I'm not saying we're all Picassos, but you can see the analogy, yes?

I don't really truly believe that we can "own" something as abstract as a shape, no matter how specific that shape is. Sure, we should get paid for our work, but eventually we'll die. The shape lives on in the mind and the void forever.

It's like how we think we "own" land...but really, the land owns us. The earth was here before us, and all shapes already exist, theoretically. We aren't really designers, just "finders." :D

Perhaps I should upload poorly-done loose pencil sketches instead?

For the record, I'm not «offended» as such when people post suggestions, but frankly I think more often than not it's beside the point. The question is how the person who already has the job (me, in this case) can come up with the best solution – and this <em>needs</em> to be fueled by a strong concept in turn fueled by communication with the client. Therefore I feel that questions usually help more than direct suggestions, and words usually more than pictures; and when people start posting pictures, threads sometimes develop a competitive side that is really beside the point. But everyone sees this a bit differently.

That said, I'm one for minimalism in terms of only using the elements I need to communicate; and frankly, I don't feel my concept is «lacking» any additional elements, some of which seem nice, but all of which to me seem to water down the clarity of the concept. Thanks for the food for thought, though.

<cite>"The form of an "A" without its crossbar feels foreign and intimidating (to me)."</cite>
Really? Feels more techy to me, but it's been done a number of times. See the <a href="http://www.jigyo.com/Military/Memorabilia/SmallPatches/NASA/7401.jpeg">old NASA logo</a> or <a href="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2008/06/24/091044.1-lg.jpg">KIA Motors</a>. There are more. 

<cite>"It needs a personal touch to push it in that direction. Right now, the cursor idea is not clear enough to stand out"</cite>
How do others feel about this? All the people I've directly tested it with so far have immediately seen the arrow/cursor. (I'm thinking the fact that the black shape seems slightly odd – with the thick serifs that are also longer on the inside [which however is not at all unheard of for "A"s BTW] – may help people see there is something else going on, too.)

Will check back once I have more to show. Thanks all, so far.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">KIA and NASA use the 'A' in context with a word. That makes it readable and obvious that it is the letter 'A'.

Using a standalone "A" without a crossbar and without a phonetic context makes it more obscure and intimidating. It feels "alien" without support around it, or something to signify that it is a letter. Your slab serifs help to explain that it's a letter and I recommend serifs if you use that direction, but I stand by my earlier comment: a lone 'A' without a crossbar (in any font) feels a bit awkward. If nothing dynamic is happening with it (slab serif, basic structure), it will have a harder time communicating something specific. Interpretations of its significance would probably vary wildly if you shared it with people and asked for opinions on its meaning (which has already happened in this thread).

The bottom line: I feel that people should be able to look at this and:

1. immediately see an 'A'
2. immediately tell that it is for a tech company

"diligence, stability, hard-working no-frills trustworthiness and such"

I think a banner, shield, cropped figure/ground rectangle could help solidify the mark.

[[http://www.portland.com/portland/wp-content/uploads/rose-quarter-logo.jpg]]

This logo uses a crop box and the mark becomes a sort of stamp or plaque. That approach might be more appropriate for what you're doing.</div>

Me too! I also think it’s worth to try a cursor version, but maybe just with a small angle at the bottom and a small non-horizontal angle on the left bottom of the cursor, preserving “stability”.</div>

Thanks for the «angle» thought. By ever-so-slightly tilting the cursor (and making it much smaller – and that curve-vs-corner thing*), it becomes more recognizable as a cursor (echoing IT) / a pointing arrow (resonating with the [Latin] «ad» part of the company name) while remaining very simple/minimal. The mark also cites/suggests the "A", but doesn't actually have to read as an "A". Client's happy, I'm happy. Thanks to you guys too!
.
(* Which I originally got the idea for by looking at Trilby's "A"; and which is echoed nicely, if differently, by the paired Stag.)</div>

Ben: This is Lessebo stock (from Sweden it seems). My printer has been recommending it as a slightly-less-expensive alternative to Conqueror and the like; it comes in different shades, weights, surface finishes and they also make envelopes and stuff, so it's nicely versatile for identity work.

Ben, the only thing that has always been disappointing for me is printing business cards in digital. Blegh. It can be hard to communicate the cost of offset printed cards (especially for clients who say they only need a small quantity) but it sure pays off. Apart from that, I find that working with a good print shop is worth a lot. My printer is very good about warning me when I pick for example a stock that doesn't make sense, and recommending things himself. Especially since I don't originally come from a print design background, that sure helps.
Jörg, in case that was a question :-), I'm never sure about OSFs on business cards… In this case Stag simply doesn't have any, and in a way I feel the lining ones click nicely with the slight «office»/«business» look of the design. Hybrids might have been an option too.</div>
