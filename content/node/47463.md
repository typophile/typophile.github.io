body: "A number of year ago I inherited about 80 lbs of type and a small hand press
  (needs new ink rolls).  My mother used all of this along with a large 1800's press
  (now gone) to create stationary, flyer's, etc. in the 60's before PCs. She purchased
  all of the type and equipment by going to auctions (many small town news papers
  going out of business auctions) in northern Missouri.  I now need to dispose of
  it but find that a problem.  I don't really want to destroy it I would like to find
  someone that might use it.  Other than the ink, which has dried out, I think everything
  necessary is there. Spacers, etc.  I remember her settig pages.  However finding
  someone that wants it and shipping is an issue.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    ATF type in very good condition. I live in SW Wisconsin. We'd have to discuss
    what typefaces you have and shipping, etc.\r\n\r\nwork # = 888-444-MILK x3338
    (Mike)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n(Last time I took a bunch of lead type to the scrap
    yard I got nineteen cents per pound for it...I heard the price is down since then.)\r\n\r\n"

    local Craigslist. Contacting your local art/design schools will probably turn
    up some letterpress/book arts types who will take it.

    could also try asking these institutions:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mnbookarts.org/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sfcb.org/\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure they would both be interested in acquiring your type."
