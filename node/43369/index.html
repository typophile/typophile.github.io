  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>just a quick question. For a simple book design i am obliged to use times. I think Plantin would be a subtly better option. Is this just my opinion (caused by the over-use of times?) or do i actually get the thing right for once? The book needs a regular, an italic and a bold italic (possibly also smallcaps) in 10pt.</p>
<p>thanks for your response.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree, the distinction is subtle (do you know how the faces are related?), and I think Plantin would be better. I think it has a little more character, and its sturdy serifs and color make it more comfortable for reading. Times is another face that looks spiky in digital format. Get the size and leading right and Plantin will look classic. The advantage you have is that they are similar in proportion, and few laypersons will know the difference.</div>

<p><cite>I often use Aldine 721 (Bitstream’s version of Plantin) instead of Times New Roman, especially when printing stuff in the office environment or on laser printers. The vast majority of people do not notice that it is a different typeface, but Aldine 721 has a slightly darker, more pleasant color.</cite></p>

<p>&ldquo;On 2006-11-20, Times newspaper unveiled Times Modern, as the successor of Times Classic.[9] Designed for improving legibility in smaller font sizes, it uses 45-degree angled bracket serifs. The font was published by Monotype as EF Times Modern. The font was designed by Research Studios, led by Ben Preston, Deputy Editor of The Times, in partnership with Neville Brody, former art director of The Face, and lead designer on Actuel, City Limits and Arena magazines. The design team included Ben Preston, David Driver, Mike Prowse, Chris Davalle, Kathleen Wyatt Research Studios: Neville Brody, Jon Hill, Luke Prowse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Dux = Luke Prowse [[http://www.typophile.com/node/29521|drew Times Modern]] he was evidently indulging in a bit of wry inside humor that I totally didn&rsquo;t get last night.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t agree with that. Times is a fine face for books. It is extremely readable (in the right size, measure, margins and leading). And ugliness of the italics is a designers opinion (with which I fail to agree). Many, many books (generally 20 years or more ago) were set in it, and I have never heard of people having trouble reading it &ldquo;for long stretches of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that said, I will agree that the font is overused, and therefore would not use it unless forced to somehow. But it is not a poor font based on other merits.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with Times for books. Never has been. It is a perfectly good face for books. As with all faces, one has to be careful about how it is used.</p>
<p>In metal Times, oldstyle figs and smalls were available, and even a long-descender version, which was splendid.</p>
<p>Today there are several &ldquo;Times&rdquo; versions to choose from, and when a typographer works out how a book is to look, and looks at all the versions and chooses the right one, a fine looking book can be made.</p>
<p>The thing most people don&rsquo;t &ldquo;want to stare at for long stretches of time&rdquo; is poorly-set type. Do not decide against Times or any other typeface because it is overused. Choose typefaces that are right for the project. That&rsquo;s the only criterion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have seen books printed in Times New Roman some 50 years ago which look really good. And I have seen many more contemporary books and magazines printed in Times New Roman that look disastrous. Is not there a big problem of lacking good digital transcription of Times New Roman ? What I would find absolutely unacceptable is setting book matter in one of those ugly Microsoft Times New Romans from Windows 98 era.. what, I am afraid, is often the case.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you really are obliged to use Times, then I&rsquo;d recommend using <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/times-ten/">Adobe Times Ten,</a> which has been designed, spaced, and otherwise optimized for smaller text sizes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only Times to use for text, in my opinion, except for perhaps <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/times-europa/">Times Europa,</a> although that&rsquo;s also a step or two removed from Times.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m no huge fan of Times New Roman and its variants generally, I have seen the family used beautifully in some instances.</p>

<p>A great pity that this has not been digitalised — for many books this would be the one to use!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with gulliver: Adobe Times Ten in OpenType is the biggest, best proportioned and snappiest Times on the market, and being able to shift globally to oldstyle figures makes it right for books too. It&rsquo;s the only one with OSFs, as far as I know. But that&rsquo;s if you have to use Times at all; it is, after all, the most over-exposed typeface on earth now.</p>
<p>The problem with Plantin is choosing between the light weight, which is too light for reliable use under 11 pt, or the regular weight, which is a little too black and clumps up. But I love the look and proportions for Plantin and always have. Depends on your point size and the paper. Plantin Light works with smooth or coated stock but not below 11pt. The toothier the stock the better the regular weight looks.</p>
<p>Be sure to buy your OpenType Plantin from Monotype&hellip;they have OSFs; Adobe&rsquo;s OT does not.</p>
