  improving letter forms. black and white version shown.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/univers_3663.gif]\r\n\r\nVery
  interested in suggestions on secondary font (used on letters, arch drawings etc).
  Suggested 'Univers light' but are considering 'Univers condensed light'. Any suggestions
  for secondary condensed font? It needs to be sans serif and simple. Univers light
  condensed would work fine but for reasons we probably can't go into we don't want
  to use it. We are looking for something that works well with the logotype; could
  be contemporary, is condensed and has a high x height. \r\n\r\ninfo on logo:_ client
  was interested in monocase letterforms. after conceptual development and research
  we progressed to developing letterforms similar to 'Bauhaus' & 'Universal'. Company
  comprises of three architects combining to create one company. The Bauhaus interested
  us in this idea of many ideas coming together etc. Letterforms for logo created
  based on this research  \r\n\r\nthanks"

    become one and you'll surely lose the small gap you have between the bowl and
    terminal of the stroke on the _e_\r\n\r\nAs far as a condensed light face for
    a secondary face, if you intend to use it at small sizes there could be readabilty
    issues.\r\n\r\nJust some initial thoughts."

  body: The <em>a</em> is stiff and sharp -- perhaps too much so -- don't you think?
    Rounding up its top, like what Peignot did, might be a solution.

  body: "The logo has been approved, the request is for a secondary font.\r\n\r\nThe
    logotype has a definite style direction, I'm not sure Univers is the right secondary
    font. I might use one of the more simple versions of Chalet. You can see that
    Chalet Comprime 60 is too much of a good thing, but 70 or 80 might work very nicely.
    You could then adopt the rest of the chalet family for other part of the kit,
    if you'd like. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/univers_3663-tkw_5291.gif]"

  body: "Some great posts here, thanks for your time and thought.\r\n\r\nYes, the
    logotype is approved, so the letterform comments I'm looking for are more along
    the lines of David's comment on the e, cheers! The letters, including the a, are
    generally based on Bayer's Universal Font, but I've made the letters terminate
    horizontally, which fills out the circular shapes and makes it look more neutral.\r\nThe
    general design scheme of this font is to make the letterforms with the most ecconomical
    use of strokes. Also, I like tight letterspacing and monocase fonts!\r\n\r\nMy
    reasoning behind the choice of secondary font is related to our client's use of
    text. In architecture, a lot of text is necessarily generated in meeting minutes
    etc that form legal documents for each project. Also, architectural drawings are
    usually highly noted. We specified Univers Light Condensed for this client in
    a former life, and it really worked well. With the font I am now seeking, I would
    like something to compliment the logotype rather than mimic it in a condensed
    fashion. Univers Light looks good, but would increase paper use at the clients
    office! Chalet is a great tip, thanks Miss Tiffany. I'll need to test it as longer
    text, though."

  body: "No sorry; there is no tag line with logo (above was Miss Tiffany suggesting
    Chalet as secondary font). Secondary typeface will be selected to compliment the
    logo and used on the text of business card and other stationary items and also
    throughout notes on architectural drawings.\r\n\r\nChalet 80 as shown above by
    Miss Tiffany would suit as would Univers light condensed because they are condensed
    and have a higher x height. They also suit because the letters terminate in horizontals.
    Condensed would help in minimising area of text on architectural drawings and
    of course allow more words. When choosing a font though l would like to ensure
    it works for all situations and that it looks good."

    has to be at a larger point size than uncondensed and the same is true of light

  body: "True.\r\n\r\nl think when making the selection l will definately need to
    take this into consideration.\r\n\r\nbelow are three sans serif condensed fonts
    that l believe may suit the logotype. All three would have different tone of black
    due to stock weight when used is paragraph text etc. Univers light condensed has
    slightly wider characters than the other two; making it seem lighter/cleaner and
    not as black on page when used. hopefully because Univers Light Condensed is not
    as oval/condensed this also would mean that point size would not have to be increased
    to much.\r\n\r\nYou could argue that this is the case for Helvetica Neue Light
    condensed and l do like the 'c' although the 'e' is more oval than Univers. l
    think Helvetica Neue Light Condensed may not suit as well because of the logotypes
    character roundness.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts_5905.gif]"
