  fonts and fonts with a rough appearance to look as the old printed original book
  page. Preferably of the same style as the attached example.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the
  correct classification of these fonts?\r\n\r\nFor refernece: classic writers of
  the period are John Milton, Henry Fielding and Daniel Defoe. Image source: http://adoptabook.vassar.edu"

  body: Thank you so much for those excellent suggestions. I think I will go with
    IM Fell English Roman for my current project. And I was happy to read that Fell
    was the cause of iKern, since iKern has helped my favourite modern type designer
    Jos Buivenga (exljbris).
