  body: "I looked through my Script Font ID Guide, and did not see a match under the
    Everyday (part 9) or Antique (part 10) Handwriting fonts, but those in [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script10Pg1.html|Part
    10]] are most similar, particularly Texas Hero, Emily Austin and Manuscript (which
    has several modern digitizations including those by Canada Type (Diva) and Nick
    Curtis (Bayern Handscript?), to mention two of them).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
