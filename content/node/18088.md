  uploads, so I just uploaded a 4 page pdf, hope that's ok.\r\n\r\nI'm doing an assignment
  for my typo class where I choose to make a book with the poem of Tim Burton called
  \"Vincent\".\r\n\r\nNow I'm just trying out some colours and trying to find ways
  of positioning the type but I'm getting a bit stuck at the moment and could do with
  some feedback just to see if I'm going in the right direction or that perhaps it's
  pretty crappy what I'm working on.\r\n\r\nI decided the book to be A5 landscape
  (small easy to carry around and because it's a very entertaining poem I'd like it
  to be small to have my friends read it).\r\n\r\nAnything is possible really and
  I think that what I made so far is a bit too boring for a typography assignment.\r\n\r\nDon't
  really know what more to say, so here it is."

    that I feel will help.\r\n\r\nUnity is often of the utmost importance for a successful
    composition. \r\n- Consider this with your choice of typeface; presently you have
    used four very different face's which do not correlate well at present.\r\n- Think
    about your grid; it feels slightly loose and un-unified.\r\n\r\nYou would do well
    to introduce some more hierarchy; consider amplification, elaboration and proximity.\r\n\r\nAre
    your pages facing? Has this been considered?"

    body: "Thank you very much for your feedback.\r\n\r\nYes the pages are faching.
      \r\nThat's also one of the things that is not sure yet.\r\nThe reason I chose
      this poem is that it's about 2 people. So I made the grid so that whatever vincent
      malloy says starts all the way at the left and what price says a couple (4)
      tabs more to the right. (I'm still looking how to produce a better communication
      between the 2 whilst still keeping them seperate, ie. cutting the pages).\r\nOne
      other way of keeping them seperate is by using different fonts for malloy and
      price (price being evil and dark, malloy being just a young boy), but like you
      said, perhaps that's not a very wise way of achieving my goal.\r\n\r\nDo you
      think the colourscheme is ok?\r\nDo you think I could get away with using different
      sizes for certain words (or perhaps fading some words in the background or something
      to make it a bit more dynamic)?.\r\n\r\ngrtz, tnx,\r\ndavid.\r\n\r\nNone are

  body: I would really try to push this to more accurately convey the content of the
    poem - which is a kid's obsession with scary things? The colors and type don't
    match the content (with the exception of the type you've ended the right pages
    with). The border detracts from the poem itself. I would also look for some body
    type that isn't so clean and classic, but still legible. I can see this being
    black and white, or black and red. Something very clean, but "scary"

  body: "I would agree with Chris, the colour system and border detail is probably
    too rigid in this circumstance to fairly depict the \"scary\" poetic detail.\r\n\r\nYour
    idea of separating the two voices by use of grid is an option worth exploring
    further - currently as I mentioned I do not feel that it works particularly well.
    Have you explored using one page for one voice and the other for the second? For
    example Price is always on the left page while Malloy the right?\r\n\r\nAnother
    option for separating the two voices may be careful selection of typeface - a
    specific face for a specific voice - though remembering to restrict your palate
    of faces to ones that work well together for a specific reason.\r\n\r\nKeep exploring
    and experimenting. You have a \"fun\" poem to work with so let this show through
    in your exploration of its meaning.\r\n\r\n-nic"

      a scary mood.\r\nI'll try some different typefaces as well...do you think the
      blackletter would work for the evil vincent or is a blackletter too different

    see, you're really looking much better. I'm still not sure about how you're treating
    the border. It looks art deco to me, and not "victorian gothic"

  body: "I disagree with the change of direction, to me the poem does not call for
    a scary feel, you have given it a look which will cause the reader to prejudge
    the poem. I much preferred the innocent look of the first pdf, although the division
    into a dialogue isn't entirely working so I would drop the names from the top,
    the use of tracking doesn't work for me maybe it is just too emphasised and I
    suspect the Garamond, Baskerville contrast isn't enough for the casual reader
    to identify. You could experiment with the blackletter idea, but it would be more
    of a challenge and I suspect ultimately more effective to restrict your typefaces
    and work with alignment and colour.\r\nTim\r\n"

    body: "Again thanks for the feedback guys.\r\n\r\nLike you said TImd, I have taken
      out the names at the top earlier today because of the reason you're saying.
      I also think it made it all a bit too obvious. At the moment I'm experimention
      with a couple of other fonts. The reason I had the garamond and the baskerville
      was because I wanted to use typefaces that had established a name, but at the
      moment I'm also playing around with some freeware fonts to see if they perhaps
      communicate better (one off-topic question, I have a typeface called brokenscript
      (by letterror if I remember correctly, which tells me in FontAgent Pro that
      it's perfectly fine, but won't show up in Indesign, any suggestions?).\r\n\r\nWould
      you think I could throw in a couple of more colours? (ie. a part of the poem
      is about the sunny weather outside, could I make that yellowish or would that
      also be a bit too obvious?\r\nI must say that it's quite hard to format a poem
      because sometimes you have very long lines and sometimes just very short. Would
      you think that I made a good desiscion in the size of the book? (Like I said,
      I've shown this poem to a couple of friends and they all want a copy to have
      their friends read it, so that's why I wanted to make it quite small so people
      can carry it around, but it is a bit more of a challenge I think).\r\n\r\nI'll
      keep all your suggestions in mind while I'm going to play around a bit with
      the grid to see what other options I have to keep the malloy and price seperate
      whilst flowing together for easy reading.\r\n\r\nThanks AGAIN! =)\r\ndavid.\r\n\r\nNone

    FontAgent, try posting in the Build forum or searching there to see if anybody
    has had similar problems.\r\n\r\nYou are right, it is a challenge to format poetry,
    however since you have the lines defined for you (in that you use the lines as
    written) you can print them out, cut them into strips and position them on a blank
    sheet till you come up with something that works (easier than trying to do it
    on computer since hard/software tends to inhibit the quick changes). The size
    and format of the book are all part of the challenge, unless you come up with
    an insurmountable problem it is probably best to work with in your established
    format, since that is what you will have to do in professional life. I think as
    regards colours you should probably avoid anything that makes you think obvious.\r\nBest
    of luck.\r\n\r\nTim"
