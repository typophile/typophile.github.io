body: "The World\u2019s First Time Machine Created\r\n\r\nUCLA scientists just announced
  that they created a time machine that could help them study the earliest galaxies
  in the universe, which could never be studied before. The machine according to the
  scientists,  is the most advanced instrument of its time.\r\n\r\nThe five-ton instrument,
  the most advanced and sophisticated of its kind in the world, goes by the name MOSFIRE
  (Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration) and has been installed in
  the Keck I Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nFor

    watching a sunset is time travelling.\r\nTo give it a typographic twist, reading
    an old book is time travel."
