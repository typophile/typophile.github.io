body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1273505382flint_prepaid_3874.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  would like to find out what the \"FLINT\" font is. Image search apps identify \"Snowslider,\"
  which is almost identical on the L and N, but slightly different on the F I & T.\r\n\r\nI'm
  re-creating this logo for this same company which no longer has their original EPS
  created many years ago, but already has a great deal of marketing material in circulation,
  so an exact match is unfortunately essential.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated,
  thanks!\r\n\r\nKev"

    it's slanted position. You're a gentleman and a scholar sir. Thanks a million!
