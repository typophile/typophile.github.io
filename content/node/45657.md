  body: "That's an odd one. I wonder if it was made by customizing a narrow sans type.
    The A, N and maybe even the V could have been made from the letter U. The 'I'
    could have had serifs added. The T, O & C were used as is. That tells me find
    a font with that C and you can make the rest.\r\n\r\nIf it was me, and admittedly
    I am crude about such things, I would look at a font like [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces4.html|Tantalus]],
    shown here in the Bauhaus guide, and edit and squoosh as necessary to approximate
    your lettering. It's a brute force approach, but it requires little skill (and
    that's all I have).\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
