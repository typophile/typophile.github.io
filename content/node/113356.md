body: "Hi. My main motive in identifying this font is because to me it looks like
  this tombstone states that my 5X-great-grandfather, Samuel Curtis, lived to be 93
  years old, but every genealogical website I've found says he lived to be 95, and
  I'm assuming that's based on his tombstone. If you look closely at his age, the
  2nd digit appears to be a flat-top three (like Typewriter font), with the top part
  being connected to the bottom part at the RIGHT, not the left as a 5 would be. So
  I'd like to know, based on the actual font, is it a 3 or a 5 because that would
  change his year of birth from 1751 to 1753. \r\n\r\nI've tried to search for this
  font all over the internet and used several identification sites to no avail. And
  I searched other graves in that same cemetery to see how 3's & 5's look, but there
  were none like it (http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=59079185&PIpi=33425931).
  Does anyone have any clues? THANKS!! \r\n\r\n- R.J. Heddins (Lindale, TX)"

    in the 1840s. It was also used on European street signs and is shown in Strasse,
    a digital font from H&FJ:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Strasse_5179.jpg]\r\nIn
    this example the top stroke on the 5 tapers upward on the rhs. I have seen the
    same thing in old books from the era.\r\nThe hairlines from the top stroke to
    the curved stroke are far from conclusive, but I am inclinded to see this as a
    3 rather than a 5.\r\nDon"

    close to the one on the tombstone that many have--in my opinion--mis-identified
    as a 5.\r\nR.J.H."
