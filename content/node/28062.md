body: "<strong>Just launched!!</strong>\r\nhttp://www.udhrinunicode.org/\r\n\r\nThe
  goal of the <em>UDHR in Unicode</em> project is to demonstrate the use of Unicode
  for a wide variety of languages, using the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
  (UDHR) as a representative text. The UDHR was selected because it is available in
  a large number of languages from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
  for Human Rights (OHCHR) at <a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/\">http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/</a>.\r\nThe
  deliverables of the project are, for each language:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the text of UDHR
  in a simple XML markup. Particular attention is paid to the use of the proper characters.</li>\r\n<li>alternative
  presentations generated from the XML representation</li>\r\n<li>links to resources
  for each language, such as dictionaries and grammars (as they happen to be identified
  to build the first deliverable)</li>\r\n<li>some comments on the use of Unicode
  (e.g. which characters are appropriate)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nUltimately, all this will
  be provided to the OHCHR, which will have the copyright of all the XML files."
