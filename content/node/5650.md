    a spam/hoax than a genuine request. I don&#39;t believe you  <BR>actually <i>need</i>
    the font but just want to win a game through us. <BR>I would call that cheating...

    you don&#39;t want me to post anymore in here, fine, I won&#39;t do it anymore.
    Thx.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>BTW3 As you can see in Maria Ribera&#39;s thread
    this was succesfully  <BR>identified as being <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/zapfino-extra/"
    target="_blank"> Linotype Zapfino LT Extra One</a>. And no don&#39;t ask  <BR>me
    for the name of the freeware rip-off that was used to produce this  <BR>sample
    as I truly don&#39;t know it.

  body: I think the point is that if the font is a rip off of another font, it would
    be unethical of us to respond with details on how one might find that illegally
    produced and morally unsound font. Wether that be telling you directly or pointing
    you somewhere where that information could be found. <BR> <BR>This is why people
    are not responding, Elithabeth.  This part of the forums is for the identification
    of fonts, and kind members of the forums have done this for you, taking time and
    trouble, without payment. <BR> <BR>It is not for finding illegal fonts.

  body: Frankly Elithabeth we don&#39;t know these rip-offs because we don&#39;t  <BR><i>NEED</i>
    to know them. When people ask for identification they usually  <BR>are after the
    real thing, not some mangled low grade look-alike. <BR> <BR>And that&#39;s not
    at all saying we have anything against freeware or  <BR>shareware fonts, as long
    as they were produced by the people who  <BR>originally designed them, not by
    some crook who steals somebody  <BR>else&#39;s work.
