body: Does anyone know if the logo from Canon is made out of an existing font? Or
  is it especially designed for the logo only. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37940.gif"

  body: They&#39;ve been using different variations of that basic logo for at least
    50 years. It&#39;s not based on any font that I know of and I would be very surprised
    if it was.

    can see more glyphs such a &#34;P&#34; a &#34;l&#34; and an awfull &#34;i&#34;.
    I would say custom, but this &#34;i&#34; dot... Other glyphs are easy to get from

  body: Thanks a lot. I also figured that it was a handlettered logo. Guess I have
    to make my own glyphs if I wish to use the font. <BR> <BR>

  body: Yak, what an ugly font. I&#39;m looking for it because I&#39;m starting a
    special project of mine. It&#39;s still on a need-2-know base, so I&#39;ll fill
    you in later if you&#39;re interested. I&#39;m looking for coorporate partners
    who would like to do the same in their country.  <BR> <BR>What&#39;s with this
    font btw? It&#39;s also used by Canon as an extra. It looks like it&#39;s a real
    font, not? Does anyone perhaps know what it is? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38415.gif"
