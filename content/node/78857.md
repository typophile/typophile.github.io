  not really that confident or competent at graphic design. I just wanted some advice
  from others to where I can improve. Any positive criticism is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe
  design has been left to my discretion. The images I've used are istockphoto comps,
  I'm not going to purchase them or fix them up till I know which one I'll use. There
  is a logo for the cafe but I've removed it from these.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

  body: If you're designing something which will need to be filled in by hand (or
    by other means), you should try it in that sense (I'm especially referring to
    the looong narrow space for $).
