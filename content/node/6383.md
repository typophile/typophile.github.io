body: Hi,  <BR>I have really started liking this font, Bauer Bodoni. Seems to have
  a strange timelessness attached to it.  <BR> <BR>Do you know any web sites, which
  uses this font in its heading, sub-headings, captions etc?  <BR> <BR>Thanks  <BR>S

  body: Tiff, <BR>Maybe my geezer memory is clouded but I sure seem to remember Paul
    Rand singing the praises of Bauer Bodoni.  I kind of thought Massimo was more
    of a Bodoni Antiqua kind of guy. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Suddha, <BR>&#62;Do you know any web sites, which uses this font in its heading,
    sub-headings, captions etc?&#60; <BR> <BR>Bauer Bodoni is gorgeous beyond belief
    but the thin lines which give it elegance may be tough to see on a web site or
    in captions.  I like to let it show off at larger sizes.  For smaller sizes, Bodoni
    Antiqua has a bit more meat to it but still won&#39;t hold up on the web too well.

  body: Chris --&#62; Really? Well gee whiz and a cracker. I&#39;d love to have that
    quote in my archives. Reference? <BR> <BR>Suddha --&#62; A better version of Bodoni,
    IMHO, is ITC&#39;s Bodoni. It offers three different optical sizes making it a
    more utilitarian choice if you need it for the web. You might also swing more
    toward Didot and check out Hoefler &amp; Frere Jones&#39; version. I have licensed
    both of them and cannot think of a reason to license any other Didot&#39;s or
    Bodoni&#39;s. &#40;Although I do have a license for some of Typofonderie&#39;s
    Ambroise cause I&#39;m a sucker for Didot-like typefaces&#41;

  body: People either seem to love or hate Bodoni. I tend to like it &#40;when appropriate&#41;,
    but I especially get all warm and fuzzy when I see a Kit Hinrichs <a href="http://www.pentagram.com/portfolio-identities-10.htm">
    piece</a> that uses Bodoni... &#40;at least it looks like Hinrichs&#41; <BR> <BR>Vignelli
    and Rand certainly use it well, too.

  body: Tif, <BR>It is a fuzzy no-quote from 35 years ago so don&#39;t assume it is
    gospel.  <BR>As a young designer in my 20s &#40;1968-69&#41;, I worked for the
    Westinghouse Corporate Design Center in Pittsburgh.  Paul Rand was on retainer
    by Westinghouse and on a couple of occasions came down from Connecticut to keep
    us on the right track making design standards guides.  We were a small group of
    about 8 people so his talks were at close range.  I can&#39;t say for sure how
    the topic came up but I think it had to do with a discussion of &#34;approved&#34;
    typefaces for Westinghouse identity. Since Rand also did the IBM corporate ID,
    he mentioned the use of Bodoni as an example.  I don&#39;t have an exact quote
    for you, just the failing memory of a now old geezer.  I wish I did.  Rand was
    a real character and had a way of getting right to the heart of a matter instantly.  If
    I were to guess what it might have been it might be something like, &#34;Bauer
    Bodoni is the only one worth looking at.&#34;   I want to be clear HE did NOT
    say that. It is just my take on the way he had of being decisive and convincing.  Of
    course I was just a young pup lowliest-of-the low among the designers there so
    maybe it was being starstruck. <BR>Surprisongly, he remembered me a few years
    later when I saw him give a presentation at an AIGA/ADC meeting.  And I thought
    I was oh-so under the radar. <BR> <BR>ChrisL
