body: Well, I've started on my digitization of "Venetian" from the 1923 ATF catalog/specimen
  book. I'd like comments on what I've doing right (so far) and what I'm doing wrong.
  I'm especially interested in hints as to how I might avoid some of the "wobbles"
  that seem to have creot into the C D and E and on how I should go about keeping
  the serifs a bit more "uniform"

    some good stuff on that site, so thanks for the link!

  body: "Well, looking at the wobbles, I would get some practice with the b\xE9zier
    tools first. I do not mean to offend you of course, but it seems you haven't worked
    with b\xE9ziers very often, hence they look wobbly. It really takes some practice
    to get it right. I could suggest [[http://www.amazon.com/Logo-Font-Lettering-Bible-Comprehensive/dp/1581804369|Leslie
    Cabarga's book 'Logo, Font & Lettering Bible']], which has some very easy to understand
    explanations on how to work with b\xE9ziers. Things like; minimize the amount
    of nodes or keeping b\xE9zier handles straight as much as possible (i.e. horizontal
    and vertical), etc. I think it's about US$20, so that's not too bad.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at your PDF, I think you probably have too many nodes, and also nodes with only
    one b\xE9zier handle. It's impossible to get smooth curves this way.\r\n\r\nBriem's
    site is also a nice source indeed, which also discusses b\xE9ziers a bit I think.
    If you search google on b\xE9zier curves you will probably find more handy tips
    and tutorials."

    b\xE9zier handles, I quickly traced your D:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/D-nodes_6464.png]\r\n\r\nNote
    that I also placed all nodes in extrema, e.g. on the furthest outward/inward points
    on a line. Or well, I made it quickly, so I tried. "

  body: I'll second Quincunx's recommendation for Leslie Cabarga's book. I personally
    don't think it's a well-designed book, but it has a wealth of very good information.
    Another book I'd recommend is Karen Cheng's <em>Designing Type</em>.

  body: "Cabarga's book is, in my opinion, not well-designed at all. ;)\r\nIt actually
    looks kinda stupid. Although I have the paperback version, which has quite a nice
    matte black cover with white type. But indeed, the information is good. Especially
    if you don't know a lot about the subject yet.\r\n\r\nCheng's <em>Designing Type</em>
    is a good book, although it is more a thurough analysation of different typefaces
    and their glyphs. Not really on how to design type. Not that that is really a
    problem, though. :)"
