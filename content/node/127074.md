body: Working with a logo file that was supplied, opens in illustrator looking for
  "Rounded" Regular True Type so it is not a custom job. No such luck for google Searches.

    to the logo if, when you open the file in Illustrator, you see LABS spelled out
    in a default typeface rather than looking like the image you posted. \r\n\r\nAssuming
    that is the case, and assuming that you need to create a version where the type
    is outlined so the file reproduces correctly, I may have a workaround.\r\n\r\nTry
    this technique:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIq632I6_8w\r\n\r\nNote: if
    you are used Adobe Acrobat DC, you add a watermark via Tools > Edit PDF > Watermark
    > Add."
