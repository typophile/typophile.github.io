  trying to recreate them and have no idea who to come to to help ID them, but it
  seems this forum would provide useful help.\r\n\r\nPlease if you could identify
  any of the following it would be greatly appreciated. All 5 of the posters can be
  found here: http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Battlestar-Galactica-Propaganda-Posters/495494\r\n\r\nThanks!"
