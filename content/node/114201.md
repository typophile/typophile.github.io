body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nWould anyone be able to suggest modern typefaces that would look
  similar to the one from this old architectural blueprint (minus the clogging of
  the ink)?\r\n\r\nI thought of Gotham Rounded, but its letters are too wide in comparison.
  \r\n\r\nFor this purpose, I guess they would need to be kind of narrow\u2014but
  not condensed\u2014so they can be easily read in small sizes (CAPS only).\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts are much appreciated.\r\n\r\nC.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_Typeface_Blueprint_4621.jpg]"

  body: "The typestyles favoured on architectural and other technical drawings of
    this type were based on routered  lettering, often condensed and with rounded
    terminals. Take a look at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/planscribe-nf/|Planscribe
    NF]] from Nick's Fonts - one I've used successfully for this purpose myself.\r\n\r\nTry
    searching on the tag \"routered\" for other examples, but I think Planscribe probably
    comes closest of those I saw doing this search."

  body: "Character [Herbert F. Van Brink] made an independent digitization of Leroy
    Lettering as Leroy Lettering Light in 2003. It seems to have been forgotten. At
    least it's not listed in Luc Devroye's pager on Character http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-48632.html\r\nHere
    is a download link for Leroy Lettering Light http://www.fontspace.com/character/leroyletteringlightbeta01\r\nIf
    anyone can demonstrate that it is a rip of an earlier digital font, I will edit
    this post to delete the link.\r\nDon"
