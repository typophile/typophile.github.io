		<div class="commentbody">Hi Fabio, <BR> <BR>Not bad at all. It feels very friendly. I think the bold version will be very nice.  <BR>Still I think you'll have to make a decision. I see that the UC 'Z' and 'W' have rounded corners. Most of the other characters don't have that. Perhaps you have to choose what you want; with of without rounded corners. Perhaps that will make it more homogenious. <BR> <BR>Furthermore I think you will have to tweak the thickness of some of the characters a little. Some feel to heavy / fat in the text. I'm refering to the lc 't', 'l', 'i', 'j'. And the UC 'S' and 'E'. There's propably more, but these stood out when I had a quick overview. <BR> <BR>Keep on going the way you're going. I like it. <BR> <BR>PS  Can it be you used an existing typeface as a basic? Somehow it feels familiar to me but I can't put my finger on it. But maybe that's good. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm also working on a light version of a type therefor I'm now very much into 'weight-watchers'. <BR> <BR>Great that you totally created the type from scratch. For that it looks very professional and balanced. The longer you look for it the more you will find, so keep looking. Weight-control is very important, if you ask me, because then the type will present a very even image in a textblock. Black spots in the text are disturbing when you are reading the text. Especially with a light version. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, besides the fact that I reserve the right to think that no sans can ever be a real text face, this one is too light and too constructed/mannered to &quot;hold&quot; a lot of text. But it's very cute, with great detailing, and there's no reason many people wouldn't love to use it for titling. So I recommend taking it in that direction - I think it has promise there. <BR> <BR>Overall the glyphs seems solid, and some of them have great character, like the &quot;i&quot; and the &quot;Q&quot;. <BR> <BR>As for the text block, I'd say your overall letterspacing a bit tight. <BR> <BR>BTW, did you get the stuff on p4 from&hellip; that Swiss guy's book - what was his name? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Eduardo: it does not seem to be suitable for book textsetting, because of its details form. <BR>I don't know if it's a subjective feeling, but there are some ways in treating terminals which seriously hinder readability (is that readability, right, Hrant? Sorry, but we have just a single word in italian to translate both readability and legibility). I find this problem with Metroline, for example, or with other faces I currently do not recall. <BR>Besides I insist saying calling Futura a text face is wrong. It's just that Futura has been so widely used we have no big problems reading full text in it. But a book set in Futura is really not functional.</div>

I think you've already departed from the traditional form enough.  Having less of a circle just seems to detract from legibility without adding stylistically. <BR> <BR>Also, the Registered sign (a circled R) should contrast with the copyright symbol (a circled c): They are usually only as high as a miniscule (lc x-height), with the copyright sitting on the baseline, and the registered raised so its top is even with cap or ascender height.  I think I read this all in Bringhurst, but my books are mostly in boxes right now, so I'm not sure. <BR> <BR>The florin probably should have at least a bit of an arm on both sides of the body. <BR> <BR>The last 0 on the per mille (0/00) sign seems to be a bit disconnected.  In handwriting, the two 0s on the bottom are usually connected by a line at the top, much like the top 0 of a percent (%) is usually connected to the slash in handwriting.  Your two 0s seem to just be together by accident, and could use some bringing together. <BR> <BR>If anyone is from France, please comment on the guillemettes.  Should they vertically center the middle of caps, miniscules, or some compromise? <BR> <BR>The cent sign (</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice progress! <BR> <BR>In the Roman, the darker it gets the more &quot;wobbly&quot; the outlines. And overall there is some wobble too. <BR> <BR>I think your Light should be a hair darker (and you could add an even lighter weights below it). <BR> <BR>The &quot;M&quot; and &quot;r&quot; need work. <BR> <BR>Try a narrower &quot;4&quot; with a bowing diagonal. <BR> <BR>Spacing: I would tighten it up a hair (but make the blank space very slightly wider). <BR> <BR>Italics: looks fine to me so far. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Hrant for your comments. The M, r and 4 will be adjusted. <BR> <BR>I have finished the lowercase italics. I took as reference the FrutigerNext italics. What do you think? <BR> <BR>I really like the result. The italic curves reinforces the softness of the typeface and its elegant but friendly look. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: FH_Foco_050604-37608.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*23.0*Lowercase+Italics*FH_Foco_050604%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Lowercase Italics<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/FH_Foco_050604-37608.pdf" target="_blank"><b>FH_Foco_050604.pdf</b></a> (23.0 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>
