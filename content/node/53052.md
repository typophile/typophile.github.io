  Someone sent me the logo for a retirement home that makes use off two intersecting
  \"o's\" but I don't think it is a true ligature. I have attached both logos to this
  posting.\r\n\r\nI would like to use the double-O ligature in the title of a publication,

    the overlapping structure from being a ligature? I think what you're getting at
    is the departure from normal or accepted structure for a ligature. Saying it's
    \"not a true ligature\" is an exclusionist and conservative view. If that's true,
    then you should be able to define \"true ligature\".\r\n\r\nAnd you know, the
    moment somebody defines \"true ligature\" I will be along to demolish all such
    notions.\r\n\r\n<em>I would like to use the double-O ligature in the title of

    a supermarket chain in Switzerland that's also called Coop and has <em>almost
    exactly</em> the same (new, very ligatured) logo as yours. I wonder if they're
    connected somehow, or if they aren't, who stole whose logo? ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Coop-70-rgb_6157.gif]\r\n\r\nAs
    per the \"non-true ligature\" attached to the first post, James, I don't think
    it is so much about the unusual placement of the second \"O\" than because it
    is quite visible that the second O was scaled down in size. FWIW, the differring
    weight makes it hard for me to see it as a ligature that was originally designed
    like this, as one glyph."

    symbol though. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/esta/ligatures/\">Esta</a>
    has a double O ligature that I had wanted to use/develop for a logotype, however
    due to other considerations it didn\u2019t work out.\r\n\r\nI would accept your
    description of the Mary\u2019s Woods one as not a <em>true ligature</em>, it doesn\u2019t
    seem that the second O has had enough consideration of differences in weights
    through scaling and the triangle device appears to be included for consistency
    with the A but hanging out off centre (frankly I would doubt it is very user-friendly
    for the inhabitants). In my opinion for a ligature to be a <em>true ligature</em>
    it doesn't have to join or overlap but to be designed with consideration of the
    pair (or more) of characters and with consideration to possible surrounding characters.\r\n\r\nTim"

    about an actual ligature; i.e, one single character, or glyph in the typeface.
    I think St. Mary's logotype was created by using two distinct letter o's. \r\n\r\nThe
    Audi and Olympic symbols are excellent examples of O's that intersect, but these
    are not true ligatures either. They are wonderful examples of how circles were
