  none of the devices I use on a daily basis pay attention to Type 1 hinting. \r\n\r\nSo
  is there a class of modern devices that still care about Type 1 hinting?\r\n\r\nOr
  do we pay attention to Type 1 hinting purely for backward optimization?"

  body: "I assume that when you say \"Type 1 hinting\" you also include OpenType CFF
    hinting. I'll refer to them collectively as \"PostScript hints\" as they are associated
    exclusively with PS style outlines.\r\n\r\nThe devices that NEVER pay attention
    to PostScript hints are those using Apple's rasterizer, namely Macs and iOS devices.
    Depending on the settings used with FreeType, FreeType MAY ignore the PostScript
    hints.\r\n\r\nThat leaves all versions of Windows, most Adobe applications, and
    many things using FreeType as all being things that DO use the PostScript hints.
    Also many printing devices, but given today's print resolutions hinting isn't
    usually a very big deal.\r\n\r\nThe list is pretty much the same for using TrueType
    hints, as far as I know. Also, the PS hints may be used as the source for TT hints
    in conversion.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    believe, most Type1 hinting is performed in an attempt to get TT hints from them
    automatically. "

    have 1000 upm. Probably 99%. It's still the assumed standard, unless one has specific

  body: And there are still some PDF creation tools that presuppose a 1000 unit em
    for PS fonts, including CFF OpenType, and cause errors when embedding fonts with
    different UPMs.

  body: limiting to 1000 does limit the drawing flexibility, though.  I much prefer
    2048 and the math is quite easy for it as well.  Those of us from the now ancient
    8 bit era are quite familiar with factors of 16 even if through digital images.  Also,
    I like to assume even numbers for all dimensions unless I am really stuck. [Actually,
    I work hard to make everything a factor of eight because that gives more rotational
    possibilities to the handles that control curvature.] This makes it easy to spot
    errors because any odd numbered measure is a red flag.  After the fun work is
    done and you are down to the nitty-gritty last tinkers, I am glad I have the option
    to do a tweener ;-)  When I first started designing type, one unit of a 1000 upm
    seemed so tiny. Now it feels massive.  Several years ago, Akira Kobayashi told
    a wonderful story about his visit with Zapf. While he was showing Herman some
    drawings, Herman took a look and said "This stem is a bit wider than that one."
    It turned out that even through advanced years and failing eyesight, Mr Zapf could
    still spot a one unit difference with assurance.  It took me a few years at this
    kind of work but now I find that distinction quite normal even to me--but I am
    20 years younger than Herman, too bad I have not yet achieved his skill ;-)

  body: "<em>limiting to 1000 does limit the drawing flexibility</em>\r\n\r\nVery
    much so, especially for designs with fine details and lighter weights in which
    the optical variations in stroke weight need to be precise. In the past few years,
    we've made two display types with 4096 UPM values."

  body: I might be imagining it, but having worked with both 1000 and 2048, I find
    that for at least what I mostly work on, 2048 works out better.
