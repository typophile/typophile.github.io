  body: The image is kinda small but I'd say [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond-premier/|
    Garamond Premier Pro Italic]] for the first line with swash variants for E and
    S and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/goudy-old-style-mt/|Goudy Old Style]]
    in the middle. Couldn't figure out the script though...
