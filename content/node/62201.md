  My only reference source is my Typography iPhone app, so I feel it necessary to
  consult the sages on Typophile. What do the reference sources advize?\r\n\r\nOn
  another note: Does anyone know what the rules are for capitalization following colons?
  There does not seem to be an either-or rule; it is more complex than that. Does
  anyone know the rules or some good style guidelines to get a grip on colons? I would
  rather not have to avoid using colons altogether because the guidelines are so murky."

    will be regional differences when it comes to these sorts of things.\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    Chicago Manual of Style,</cite> which is a widely accepted guide in the US, addresses
    your first question in two sections: 6.127 and 6.129. Basically, if the list is
    introduced by a complete sentence and a colon and the list items are short, then
    the list is not punctuated and does not end with a period. If the introduction
    to the list is not a grammatically complete sentence and the list elements consist
    of phrases or sentences themselves, then usually the list is punctuated with a
    semicolon between items and concluded with a period. \r\n\r\nBut there's room
    in there for plenty of nuance and exception.\r\n\r\nYour second question is addressed
    by the CMS in \xA76.64. Again summarizing: When the colon is used within a sentence,
    then it is followed by lowercase (unless a proper name). When the colon introduces
    several separate sentences, then the following word is capitalized.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know if these guidelines would apply equally in Danish. "

  body: "The problem with Denmark and the typographic guidelines is that there do
    not seem to be any. Of course, as far as the colon is concerned, that is something
    else entirely in Danish.\r\n\r\nUsually, be it English or Danish, I refer to Oxford's
    style guides, as I use British English, but I just haven't had the time to peruse
    their guidelines. Actually, and the reason I wrote here, is that I thought that
    the guidelines on lists were somewhat universal which is what had me bewildered.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the pointers."

  body: "Here's what I recall from the Sister Agnes Virginia Manual of Style:\r\n\r\nThe
    initial cap and closing period are attributes of a sentence. If a list entry is
    a complete sentence, it should begin with a capital and end with a period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Here
    are the things I have to do today:</strong>\r\n<strong>* Wash the car.</strong>\r\n<strong>*
    Feed the dog.</strong>\r\n<strong>* Pick up the dry cleaning.</strong>\r\n\r\nList
    entries that aren't sentences don't need an initial cap or a period. If the list
    completes a sentence that was begun in the paragraph above, put a period after
    the <em>last</em> entry in the list.\r\n\r\n<strong>National Bohemian Beer is:</strong>\r\n<strong>*
    wet</strong>\r\n<strong>* cold</strong>\r\n<strong>* delicious.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
    same principle applies with a colon: If you can remove the words <em>before</em>
    the colon and still have a complete sentence, then use an initial cap after the
    colon. \r\n\r\nIf the words that follow the colon don't form a complete sentence,
    then treat them as what they are: a sentence fragment. "
