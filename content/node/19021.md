  body: That free version has really nasty curves. It looks like it was scanned in
    from a book an auto-traced. It also lacks a even-close-to-complete character set.

  body: "> That free version has really nasty curves.\r\n\r\nCould you tell that from
    looking at my magazine cover or opening the font in some program? Some of y'all
    seem to notice things that I am oblivious to. I stopped being picky about character
    sets when they are free.\r\n\r\nAlso, I should mention I have seen this font in
    several programs I've bought through the years. (goofy programs like Print Artist
    that I bought just for the fonts and photos which are included)"

    picky about character sets when they are free.</em>\r\n\r\nWell, when you use
    something that is free, you often get what you paid for ;-)\r\nSeriously though,
    I wanted to check the font out since you offered it as a direct alternative to
    University, which is not free, and whose designer is alive and working. \r\n\r\nIf
    someone only needs to set a few words (and those words are going to be printed/posted
    rather small) then no one will notice the deficiencies of that free font. But
    for anything else, you're better off heading straight for the original."

    I wish could be a standard of the industry.\r\n(I know, if wishes were horses
    we could all take a nice ride)\r\nI wish companies would start putting the name
    of the designer in the info line. Like \"Designed for Letraset by so and so\").
    Many times I've wanted to know who made a font I like, and couldn't find anything
    about it."

  body: "Well, we've been doing that at Linotype, at least for new OpenType-format
    fonts.\r\n\r\nFor all of the older fonts, there is our website. We try to put
    a lot of information on the font pages. Designer and year of release are almost
    always there. And more and more often, we  put descriptions (of varying length)
    up, too, so that customers can learn more about the fonts, and hopefully make
    better purchases and know where best to use them, etc."
