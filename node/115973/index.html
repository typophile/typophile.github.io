		<div class="commentbody"><p>It would depend to some extent on how you treat any other text-breaking elements. Does the document have subheads? chapter titles? How does the text start after them? There is nothing special about an asterism, it simply one more way to signify a break in the text. In fact, with or without any particular  typographic devise, we always term such &ldquo;spacebreaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You need to give some thought to what to do when one falls at the foot or head of a page, BTW. That&rsquo;s where too much extra space above and below can create a headache, if you&rsquo;re balancing spreads. And whether or not to start the new paragraph not only without indent, but a few words in, say, small caps. You don&rsquo;t need a club, just to avoid confusion. Work spacebreaks out for the worst case, everything else will fall into place as an acceptable compromise.</p>

<p><strong>riccardO:</strong> First comment noted, then inverted as per second one.

<strong>charles:</strong> That makes sense. The book has only chapters, no subheads, and the first paragraph after the chapter head is <i>not</i> indented, but all others are.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m leaning towards not indenting after an Asterism because it <i>is</i>, after all, a text break, and I&rsquo;d like to be consistent with the other text breaking elements (chapter heads).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What a designer &ndash; interior designer &ndash; usually does is to set up a form, not a mechanical repetition. What do I mean? Well, suppose you indent the chapter title 4 picas left. You could then indent the first text line four picas left, without implying all paragraph indents are 4 picas. You have sorta kinda suggested that paragraphs following a textual break indent, but not &ldquo;suggested strongly,&rdquo; as chapter openers also suggest &ldquo;this is display,&rdquo; even to the first text paragraph.</p>
<p>All kinds of variations: For example: you could indent the chapter <cite>title</cite> 4-5 picas left, with the chapter <cite>number</cite> flush left, and pick up on any consistent edge for the first paragraph. Or if chapters have an epigraph, dedication, whatever below the title &amp; before the first text line, remember vertical alignment. Or a subhead. None of this has any particular implication for subsequent paragraphs, esp. if the treatment is obviously different. If it is similar though, then you&rsquo;ve set up a weak promise.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re really doing with a choice is suggesting how you&rsquo;ll lead the reader in awkward situations. What if a spacebreak is just that (no ornamentation)? And what if it falls at the foot of a page or the head of a page? Essentially, without an ornament, you kill the blank line(s) How do you let the reader even know that a new paragraph has started?</p>
<p>What if a subhead starts a page, and all pages have running heads? Can they be told apart, without thought by the reader, as they stack at the top of a page?</p>
<p>There are all kinds of ways to handle these situations, but using a common approach throughout a text &ndash; regardless of exact numbers &ndash; helps a reader, without them knowing it.</p>
<p>Other questions: What&rsquo;s the stronger signal for signalling a hierarchy? Beats me. For a very short time, I used to specify A-level subheads &amp; the following text flush left, with B-level heads &amp; following paragraph indented. Then I took a look and saw just how strong the white space from that double indent actually was, visually.</p>
<p>Or&hellip; is italic stronger than roman? Ask 20 designers and you&rsquo;ll get about an even divide as to which is stronger.</p>
<p>In the end, the good designers spend more time helping a reader through a text than with obsessing over what they, as designers, like. Since your text in this example is pretty straightforward, you have a certain luxury. The mistake would be to think whatever answer you choose here will apply to all texts, without further thought.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true. But if you&rsquo;re going to use an asterism, you should find out what an asterism <strong>means</strong>. What sort of break is it, <em>why</em> did people still indent after it, and so on.</p>
<p>Using a few asterisks in a row, as is done in current books, tends to indicate the passage of time, but it doesn&rsquo;t indicate a break between subdivisions of a chapter. So indenting after that might mislead the reader into thinking a hierarchical structure is present - which explains the older practice, even though it is correct that not indenting would seem to be superior in appearance.</p>
<p>Using an asterism instead implies one is consciously attempting to be &ldquo;retro&rdquo; in the design of the book. If you&rsquo;re doing that, don&rsquo;t you want to be consistent?</p>
<p>Maybe indenting after the asterism does look bad, and though should be avoided, but it now seems to me that there is a strong case for doing so, and therefore careful thought is needed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, and I agree. The asterism kind-of concludes a story piece and introduces a break. That new story piece begins on the next page which feels natural and in place. An asterism at the top of a new page comes as an unprepared surprise to the reader and the flow stumbles.</p>
<p>From an aesthetic viewpoint, it looks much better at the bottom of a page than breaking the text line at the top of a page spread.</p>
<p>I had to wiggle and shake the text a little but managed to move the asterism to the bottom of the verso :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now this is a bit interesting. Jan Tschichold, in his essay <em>“The Importance of Tradition”</em> says, “Therefore, at a minimum the first line of the new division should begin flush left and the first word be set with capital and small caps. Better still to insert a centered asterisk.”</p>
<p>Agreed so far. However, and that&rsquo;s where this becomes relevant for this thread, in its German original the last sentence reads “Noch besser ist die Einfügung etwa eines Sternes in der Mitte über diesem Anfang.” The English translation is somewhat incomplete, and should read “Better still is the insertion of an asterisk centered above this beginning.”</p>
<p>So, if I interpret this correctly then Jan Tschichold proposes to set the asterism (or asterisk, the “Stern”) <em>above</em> the new division which would mean to set it at the top of the new page. Uhm? :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, maybe he&rsquo;s right — especially if the asterism is viewed as signaling the beginning of a new section instead of being the end of one. It&rsquo;s probably even more true if the asterism and the drop cap and small caps he mentioned are viewed as a compositional unit, of sorts, that lead off the new section.</p>
<p>More important, I think, is just making it look right and being consistent throughout the publication.</p>
