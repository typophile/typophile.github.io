    Bold using some swash alternates (maily /s). Best Bookman interpretation on the
    market is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania|Bookmania]] by
    fellow Typophile Mark Simonson.

  body: "Seems to me that the Dempster's wordmark, U.S. trademarked in 1992, is very
    close to Goudy Heavyface Condensed:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GoudyHeavyFaceCondensed_Dempsters_5276.jpg]\r\nI
    used the Berthold version for the comparison but was unable to find a current
    seller. So here is a link to the <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/font/bitstream/goudy-heavyface/condensed\">Bitsteam
    version</a>.\r\nIf  Goudy Heavyface Condensed was used as the basis for the wordmark,
    some further horizontal squeeze was done and some relatively minor modifications
    were made to the letters, except for s, which grew a long tail, and p which now
    has an old-style bottom terminal. The comma is clipped into a stubby tear shape.\r\nDon"

  body: Far better track with Goudy Heavyface Condensed suggested by Don. Even matching
    to me.

  body: "Only modification obvious to me, other than those I mentioned in my previous
    post, is that the lower part of the bowl of p is pushed in to accommodate the
    bottom terminal on the s.\r\nDon"
