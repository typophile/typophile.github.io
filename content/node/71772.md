  body: "That looks like Ehmcke, an old typeface that has been revived as <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/carlton/carlton/characters.html\">Carlton</a>
    by Letraset. The A and low Y are alternate glyphs. \"Kioko\" from Intecsas/David
    Rakowski, is the same typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
