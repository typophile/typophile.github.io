body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n\u0141ukasz Dziedzic's \"Lato\" is just right for my web
  design, except it doesn't offer inline numerals or, more importantly, true small
  caps. Can anybody recommend something similar? To get a feel for what I'm looking
  for, observe Lato in action on my site: http://www.utcolmus.org/auditions.html .\r\n\r\nI'm
  using Lato Light as my regular weight, and its Regular weight as my bold, so I need
  a typeface that's fairly light (not hairline, though), or offers a few different
  weights.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    facility at all, so far."

  body: Thanks for the feedback. After trying upwards of ten similarly shaped, differently
    weighted typefaces, I'm pretty happy with the overall weight of the page when
    the typeface is on the light side.

  body: "Mostly, I think that with webfonts the problem is: they should have been
    designer for screen.\r\nThe first and foremost think which hinders legibility
    is having not enough overall space. Lato is spaced tightly, and the lighter weights,
    they just give an headache to anyone which has even minor unease with reading
    onscreen. This, of course, goes for smaller point sizes."

  body: "The Light sans webfont look is very interesting. Cutting edge, even.\r\nBut
    it is out of place in this layout.\r\nIf you are going to use sans for this kind
    of subject matter, you have to go totally modernist, as if performing classical
    music in a brand new concert hall.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I'm willing to take another look at heavier
    weights\u2014I just felt the whole page got to looking too heavy, but I'm not
    an expert and would like to broaden my experience.\r\n\r\nNick, one of the things
    I'm most interested in is the way classical music is portrayed, and that includes
    typography. I want the subject matter of the site to appear ordinary and normal,
    so I don't want to go the New Music route of highly noticeable sans serif typefaces.
    (I'm a graduate student in composition, and I get enough of that in my conservatory.)\r\n\r\nI
    have no budget, so I'll look at the Myriad lookalike CartoGothic. Any other suggestions
    are highly welcome! Thanks! :-)"

  body: You need to add some space between the lines. By then, a regular weight won't
    look so horrible. Be sure to double check Win XP rendering! Most web fonts break
    under those conditions.
