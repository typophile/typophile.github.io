  didn't like. (I choose Animal Planet becuase they recently changed the entire identity
  of Animal Planet, and the new logo is horrid.) I've been working on this for weeks,
  but I still don't feel completely satisfied with it. I almost feel like there is
  something missing... Any suggestions would be grand. \r\nIll post all three logo
  so you can see the evolution..hah\r\n\r\nP.s, my illustrator skills are limited

    have simply squooshed the letters like that - the \"N\" especially looks like

    N and A, I don't understand what the lone rotated M is trying to communicate.
    I can see their attempt for wildness, but the execution is poor.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the project improvement, it's not executed very well either. The lines are not
    smooth and appear jagged, especially on the elephant's trunk. You should read
    up on bezier curves and optimal node placements, to get the understanding of how
    bezier curves (with Illustrator's pen tool) work. Also, try adding a secondary
    colour to add some dimensionality.\r\n\r\nWhat typeface are you going to use for
    the Animal Planet logotype?"

    with the pen tool, I was having some trouble with it...\r\nI haven't really decided
    to do the logotype. At this point I think I'm going to stick with a logo, and
    make a separate wordmark later. \r\n\r\nFunny thing about the new logo and new
    design for animal planet, is that in the press release, the stated that they wanted
    to reach a more \"Adult Audience.\" \r\n...They have a bunch of new shows like
    the Puppy Bowl. It is frightening. \r\nSo the idea I had here was to add the three
    elements...Air Land and Sea, surround them with a globe shaped object, and make
    them part of the \"world.\" My logo doesn't have quite so much \"personality\"
    as the new logo... Maybe i can try to demonstrate this with color..\r\n\r\nYou
    mentioned my horrible illustrator skills, but what about the design? Color? Any
    ideas are greatly appreciated."

    animals would be much better than one; and two animals at some sort of polar opposites.
    So I'd suggest one very large, one very small. So an elephant... and something
    famous for being small.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Yeah - I thought the elephant silhouette was pretty identifiable. Putting
    it in the "globe" would echo the past logo while updating it. I mean the shapes
    from my approach are simply "Animal + Planet". Obviously there can be other ways
    to resolve the design problem at hand - we'll let Wording come up with something
    they can call their own.

  body: "Here goes...\r\n\r\nYour lines are too sharp, they don't look like land masses.
    The birds are obviously copied and flipped, need some variation. The huge open
    space between the trunk(?) and the seal(?) is too obvious. The gradients are too
    subtle to make an impact, either tweak them or lose them altogether. The green
    stroke around the whole planet takes away from that \"planet\" look and meeting
    a the 2 points on the left looks weird. The green and blue you've chosen are too
    similar values, needs more contrast. The text and graphic aren't centered with
    each other. The font looks like some woodland-fairytale serif. I think the programming
    on Animal Planet is a lot more varied than that."

  body: "Well, for some constructive advice...\r\n\r\nThe value of the green and blue
    is almost identical. When that happens, it becomes difficult to discern the forms.
    I'd consider trying a much lighter blue.\r\n\r\nSome of the details in the mark
    seem a bit too subtle and maybe a bit random. The highlight seems to neither indicate
    the mark is 3-D nor does it seem to refer to anything specific. Perhaps that is
    superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe lower left of the globe outline, where its pinched, seems
    random as well (maybe it's not, but that's my gut reaction).\r\n\r\nThe type is
    OK, but you really need to keep in mind where this logo will be used most of the
    time: in the lower right of the TV channel on a TV.\r\n\r\nAs such, I find the
    details of the typeface and the gradient are going to be totally lost in that
    particular medium.\r\n\r\nFinally, look at the relationship between the size of
    the letterforms and the mark. Seems that the type could much larger.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I think there's definitely a lot that can be improved with the Planet Green logo,
    I think that's something to look at. Note how it's a very simple form and works
    quite well on TV.\r\n\r\nI do really like the concept of the 'earth, air, water'
    thing. I'd maybe think about that conceptually a bit more as well and see if you
    can build some other illustrations off of that idea. \r\n\r\nHTH!\r\n\r\n"
