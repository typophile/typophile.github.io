  the wrong search terms.\r\n\r\nWe're in a start-up for an global company in the
  food industry. So a lot of packaging and small size ingredient tables involved.\r\n\r\nWe're
  looking for a serif and a sans serif that work well together in as much as possible
  variations. E.G. Gotham from H&F is a fine one, but it does not seem to have Greek
  or Cyrillic. I've contacted FontShop about the issue as well.\r\n\r\nI understand
  possibilities get diminished a lot with these restrictions.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be nice!\r\n\r\nThx."

    from P22 has an extensive set of styles, as well as Greek and Cyrillic sets. \r\nMoreover,
    it's truly a great typeface.\r\n\r\nBrieck"

  body: A number of Adobe's typefaces have Greek and Cyrillic, especially (though
    not only) the more recent ones. Arno, Garamond Premier, Myriad, Minion, Hypatia
    Sans, etc.
