body: G&#39;day, <BR> <BR>I have just been employed as a  <BR>graphic designer/signwriter
  at <BR>a place called &#34;Signz &#39;n Graphix&#34;. <BR>It seems that I have some
  at a  <BR>fortunate time, as we have decided  <BR>to totally redesign, starting
  from  <BR>our internal processes to applied <BR>identity. At the moment we design,
  <BR>print &#40;digital xerox and riso&#41;, vinyl <BR>and photographic signage,
  large <BR>format quality art reproductions. <BR>We want to keep it simple and  <BR>apply
  the branding to business <BR>cards to outdoor signage. I have <BR>chosen Thesis
  Sans as the main <BR>typeface as it appears to work very <BR>well from large to
  small. I am thinking <BR>of a pallette of yellow&#43;black, a homage <BR>to nz&#39;s
  road signs and blatant visiblity. <BR>At the moment the building is a purple <BR>colour
  and promoted as &#34;the purple <BR>place&#34;. I think it is quite tired &#40;15
  years&#41; <BR>and dated, as the road signage is pretty <BR>much invisible from
  a distance and  <BR>a new building next door blocks the view <BR>of our premises
  from the road. <BR> <BR>The bottom image shows our current <BR>street sign from
  50m down the road. <BR>I am trying to get the name spelt  <BR>&#39;correctly&#39;
  - signs &amp; graphics instead <BR>of signz n&#39; graphix, which is a pain <BR>to
  spell and looks amateurish. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42915.gif"

  body: Kris -- <BR> <BR>What you&#39;ve done already is a huge improvement on what
    can only be described as ghastly. I like the yellow / black combo, and as much
    as that purple makes me heave, it would sit as well as anything with it. I love
    the elegance of logo one, and the second version tickles me. I would also agree
    that it simply HAS to be spelt right. I&#39;m curious as to what kind of client
    you receive. The few suggestions you&#39;ve already mocked up suggest a marked
    jump in &#39;quality&#39; of client.

  body: Kris, your intensions might be right but if the business is registered as
    siznz and graphix it might cost your company some nz bucks to get it changed even
    if you can. Someone else might have the name signs and graphics and thats why
    they used that name in the first place.  <BR> As for your graphics The colors
    are good and I like the pencil with wings, but could you investigate another yellow?
    Why be exactly like a road sign. Also doesn&#39;t yellow fade when exposed to
    sunlight over time?

    logo v.2, even with the wings / crest related trendy, stylish items.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    considering their current identity?

    <BR>IANAL, but I believe you could simply state in your legalese &#39;signz and
    graphix, doing business as signs &amp; graphics&#39; <BR> <BR>I like the pencil
    icon alot. <BR> <BR>Alas, perhaps that&#39;s TOO nice for your target market? '

  body: 'Looks like a real challenge you have ahead of you Kris. Currently, I would
    be embarrassed to drive into this parking lot. I might even where sunglasses and
    a trenchcoat before getting out of my car and walking in. But it seems like you
    could really transform this companies identity into something spectacular. Looks
    like fun! You could approach it in many ways. There is something strangley interesting
    and friendly about the shape of the building. It could be really cool to incoorporate
    an icon of the building with Logo #1 Almost like rest stop signage. It&#39;s a
    not so special building that could be made to feel really important and sophisticated.
    Anyway, just a thought, GOOD LUCK!'

  body: Would it be possible to dig up some of the shrubbery in front of the building?
    It&#39;s not helping the visibility issue. Maybe some lower flowering plants/shrubs
    would work better. This is a forum for landscape design, right? <BR> <BR>Aloha!

    Best marketing for the firm I suppose. What about setting your Logotype just beneath
    this? You might get in conflict with the authority but the first few months it
    would be a killer. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik'

  body: I think what you&#39;ve done is a huge improvement. I feel your pain as far
    as the existing stuff goes, and am glad they are ready for a redesign. Good luck
    convincing them on the name change, too. They need it. <BR> <BR>I worked at a
    similar place and the owner wanted lots of those little sideways triangles on
    everything because they were all over an Elvis Presly calendar he had and thought
    they were the coolest deign element ever. Ugh.
