  I\u2019m also new to Indesign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m just curious about the drop
  caps in Indesign, is it possible to do like the first example in my attachment without
  manually setting first line -10 indent and the rest of the paragraph +10 indent,
  and then forcing a hard linebreak to reset the indent for the rest of the text ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  old typographer in me cringes when I see the default result Indesign gives me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenning.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/initial_6276.jpg]"

  body: Not that I know of, as I spent a good deal of time trying to find a solution
    to a drop cap "A" a few weeks ago. I'd be eager to find out about a "real" solution
    if there is one, too.

    question properly. Could the solution be in Scripting?"

  body: "Haven't found a way either. Other than adding half a dozen anchor points
    to the text box, and redrawing it. Which is what I usually spend my time doing.\r\n\r\nA
    friend of mine and I are working on a couple plug-ins right now -- one of which
    will hopefully fix this. If/when we ever get it finished, I'll post something
    here."

  body: "I've always (since Quark 2) used negative manual kerning, paragraph return
    (\"justify all lines\") for the first line, and tabs for the next (two) lines.
    The reason I like tabs is that you can drag the setting and position it \"by eye\".\r\n\r\nI
    don't think there can ever be a fully-automated way to do this, as the side-bearings
    of characters vary considerably within fonts. And between fonts, some have negative
    sidebearings for A, others positive -- and there is built in kerning in some fonts
    as well."

  body: There's a section in Nigel French's book, InDesignType, that explains how
    to do this using text wrap without resorting to -spacing. I think you convert
    the initial cap to outline and then adjust the wrap to taste.

  body: "OK, this is an old thread, but one way to do this is inserting two hair spaces
    after the Drop Cap, then mark/select the second hair space, and give it a negative
    kerning of -700/-800 (depending on what letter).\r\nIn Quark you can do this the
    same way by inserting two ordinary spaces (but that can\xB4t be done in InDesign.)"
