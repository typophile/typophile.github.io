body: "I have been on the television news this weekend, on several Belgian channels.
  I was in photos in almost every Belgian newspaper, mostly in the Arts or Culture
  sections. One of these newspapers even published an online photo special, and you
  can send friggin' e-cards with me on it!<!--break-->\r\n\r\nWell, that is me and
  the 1949 other participants of <a href=\"http://www.spencertunick.com/\" target=\"new\">Spencer
  Tunick</a>'s installations for the <a href=\"http://www.corpusbrugge05.be/\" target=\"new\">Corpus
  Brugge 05</a> art festival last Saturday morning. It was freezing cold, barely 5\xB0C.
  It was raining. The ones that couldn't get in at the first installation (limited
  capacity) had to wait from 03:15 till 06:45, outside, with no shelter, waiting for
  sufficient light for the outdoor shoot. During the shoot we were standing with our
  bare feet in puddles of icy water on wet cobblestones. And just because I was at
  the outskirts of the installation, I was smack dab in front of the television cameras
  and newspaper photographers who were positioned a mere 10 meters away.\r\n\r\nI
  have been on the <a href=\"http://www.vrtnieuws.net/nieuwsnet_master/default/magazine/overzicht/050507_CorpusBrugge/index.html\"
  target=\"new\">television news</a> this weekend, I was in photos in <a href=\"http://www.standaard.be/extra/fotospecials/index.asp\"
  target=\"new\">almost every Belgian newspaper</a>, you can even send friggin' e-cards
  with me on it... naked.\r\n\r\nWould I do it again? In a heartbeat. This experience,
  nobody can take that away from me. My wife thinks it's funny like hell and wishes
  it had been summer so she could've joined me, my kids think I'm way cool (luckily
  they're not teenagers yet), and my colleagues and friends all had a good laugh.\r\n\r\nI
  am become art, and it was friggin' awesome."

    seen the pictures identified me correctly. I am bald, slim, rather tall, have
    a trimmed goatee, a fair complexion and a small gecko tattooed in my loin."
