  body: "Does NID have established, official exchange programs with any schools in
    English-speaking countries (they must have some already, right?)?\r\n\r\nFor all
    practical purposes, students are usually limited to exchange programs with official
    exchange partners. Otherwise, you have to convince a school in a foreign country
    to take you on for a semester or year on your own merits, and you may have to
    pay their full tuition fees as well, which (in the UK and especially in the US)
    can quickly become extraordinary expensive.\r\n\r\nPresuming that NID already
    has established partners, why don't you post the names of those partners here?
    Mostly, someone on Typophile will have direct (or at least second-hand) experience
    with the school(s), and can offer you specific feedback."

  body: Even though I had never seen or heard anything about it prior to this past
    school year, SVA always has third year exchange students. I don't know that they're
    actually exchanged, but we certainly take a lot of foreigners for a semester at
    a time. In the past year I've seen Israelis, Norwegians and French exchange students,
    for whatever it's worth I don't see why India would be excluded, although dan_reynolds
    is right. It may require a little investigation...

  body: "Julia, I don't mean to imply that SVA (or any other school) would exclude
    students from India (or any other country\u2026). What I mean that, especially
    in the US, most design schools have an \"official list\" of schools that they
    partner with. If you aren't in one of those schools, you can petition both schools
    to start a new exchange program, or you can try to go as not part of any program
    at all. Both options are hard.\r\n\r\nTo date, I've studied at three design schools
    in two countries\u2026 one of those experiences was as a \"semester abroad.\"
    All three schools only really took students from official partner schools. At
    least, unless you wanted to pay full price\u2026"

  body: I'm located in Finland and all schools here have these lists as well. If the
    school you're applying to don't have an agreement with your school you'll most
    likely have to pay tuition fees (and they can be VERY high, specially in the UK).

  body: dan, I wasn't disagreeing with you, I was just saying that SVA seems to be
    on multiple lists, and possibly one of NID's...

  body: "yeah.....\r\ncolleges like ENSAD(paris) have these exchange programs with
    our college but since that would secure 2 odd students, the rest go about looking
    for other colleges.....\r\nofficial exchange programs have an MOU signed with
    NID so only the cream of the lot is sent.....(which does not include me)\r\n\r\ni
    had a senior spend a semester at MICA, Baltimore....from what she told me, if
    you request them, your tuition fee is waived...\r\n\r\nso right now i wanted to
    figure what colleges would be willing to do such a thing....\r\n\r\nand thanks
    a lot everyone for these inputs.....keep them coming!"

  body: I'm from Baltimore originally. The graphic design program at MICA seems to
    be coming along, from what I hear. When I started studying, I did not go to MICA
    because they didn't have a graphic design major there yet. MICA is a real art
    school, i.e., most of the students stidy various fine art disciplines, not things
    like graphic design. This has its ups and downs. But if you can get to MICA easily,
    I say go for it.

  body: "Have you looked at SCAD lately?\r\nSavannah College of Art & Design\r\n\r\nThey
    have in the past worked with exchange students. The college is excellent, the
    teachers enthusiastic, the student body - great. They live what they teach, and
    that is to recycle and grow. They own more buildings than any other art college
    in the U.S.A. It is an \"urban\" school - but what an adorable community...\r\nhttp://www.scad.edu/\r\n\r\n*******\r\n\r\nBut
    first choice for me would have been RISD (if I were still young and could take
    the winter months) http://www.risd.edu/\r\n\r\n*******\r\n\r\nWhy not buy a book
    on the different Universities and see which one is up to your standards and can
    meet your goals. Then report back and see what the folks who attended them say.
    They may offer new insight to you.\r\n\r\nWas there any one in particular you
    were interested in?"

    in Germany, a friend of mine from Germany wanted to study abraod at RISD for a
    year. But they turned him down, because our German school was not one of RISD's
    official partner schools. They said he could come as a guest student, and pay
    full tuition. \r\n\r\nInstead, he went to MassArt, which was a partner school
    of the German school in question, and even he got a full Fullbright Scholarship
    to pay for all living expenses! He had a great year, of course."

    of quality art/design schools/programs (along with a whole heap of really bad
    ones).\r\n\r\nIf you're aiming for a specific area, let us know and we can help
    narrow it down for you."
