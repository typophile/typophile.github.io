body: Anybody know of anything that works in InDesign CS like the Kerning Table editor
  in Quark? <BR> <BR>I know I can custom kern the typeface with TypeTool, but sometimes
  that&#39;s a hassle, because everybody along the line has to be using the same edited
  font suitcase. Is there a way to custom tweak a pair in InDesign and have it apply
  globally to the document?

    else, please let me know!"
