    <BR>Design and lettering by Alex Steinweiss, 1948 <BR>From &#34;For the record&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>The incomparable Steinweiss used many pens, did plenty of embellishments in
    many genres, but never classical-style flourished ligatures. &#40;So far as I
    can tell from my record collection and the examples in the book.&#41; Here, he
    could have done the &#34;st&#34; lig in Kostelanetz. <BR> <BR>The style of lettering
    identified with him, now available as a font named &#34;Hairspray&#34; for some

    is the notion that changes in typeface design can significantly improve on what

    some elusive readability is, as I&#39;ve said before, to willfully ignore the
    daily reading experience of many hundreds of miliions of people reading a great
    diversity of writing systems under incredibly diverse and often adverse conditions.
    Human beings are better at reading than any improvement at the type design level
    can significantly affect. If you really cared about readability, you wouldn&#39;t
    be talking about type design at all: you&#39;d be talking about page layout, printing
    and screen technologies, and other things that do have a significant impact on

    in text make it less comprehensible, but not necessarily less readable in the
    sense that &#39;readble&#39; is commonly used on Typophile. The line between the
    cognitive acts of text recognition and of understanding is a porous one, and &#39;reading&#39;
    understood in toto involves both, but the impact of random words on reading speed
    has to do with our ability to make sense of the text, not our ability to recognise
    words. In most of the discussions of readability among typographers and type designers,
    the comprehensive aspect is ignored, since the professional obsession is with
    the cognitive act of text recognition. Introducing the comprehensive aspect of
    reading further diminishes the relative impact of type design, since it is obvious
    that good writing is more important than a good typeface.

  body: '&#62; significantly improve <BR> <BR>And yet again I have to point out the
    obvious issue: <BR>What is &#34;significant&#34; in type design? Almost nothing.
    So it&#39;s a matter of context, and a good craftsman needs to be very concerned
    with the smallest of gains - they are &#34;significant&#34; to him, as a person
    creating quality objects, if for no other reason than because that justifies his
    existence, because it makes him happy. It is in the context of our individuality
    that any of this is &#34;significant&#34; - otherwise there are <i>extremely</i>
    few really &#34;significant&#34; reasons to make new fonts. Plus that effort is
    usually better spent elsewhere anyway! <BR> <BR>Was it &#34;significant&#34; to
    use an esoteric pen to make SBL Hebrew&#42;? Who the hell would have noticed any
    difference? And then you claim &#34;enhanced dissimilation between similar Hebrew
    letters&#34;, but when needed you say it doesn&#39;t matter? And then you put
    the top-right spur on the final-kaf anyway, even though that&#39;s exactly opposite
    of the claim! Only the most conservative fonts -the ones that don&#39;t worry
    about dissimilation- do that. I honestly don&#39;t know what to think about the
    aggregate of your opinions on functionality. It really seems that you&#39;re just
    giving people what they <i>expect</i>, depending on context. Sure, expectation
    is part of functionality too, but there has to be an overall rhyme and reason,
    at least on the personal level - otherwise it&#39;s just reactionary. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Although when it seems necessary you tend to claim that the pen didn&#39;t influence
    the result... <BR> <BR>And then I have to repeat this yet again, apprently: There
    is a difference between what people think they can read comfortably versus what
    they can read comfortably for extended periods, without even realizing. It is
    in the latter arena that a good craftsman is most concerned. It is in the <i>promotion</i>
    of efficiency, not the assumption of its irrelevance, that good design is best
    expressed. People don&#39;t read &#34;fast enough&#34; [partly] because of bad
    typography &#40;and type&#41;, not because they can&#39;t read any faster. That&#39;s
    why using a serif font for a book matters for example. They can read sans just
    fine, so why not use sans for books? Because the more you push the limits of performace,
    the more the supposedly &#34;insignificant&#34; things matter. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    you&#39;d be talking about page layout <BR> <BR>But I don&#39;t like page layout.
    Get it? <BR> <BR>That&#39;s like me telling you: If you&#39;re really concerned
    about conveying information to people &#40;the main point of typography&#41;,
    then dedicate your life to the publishing and distribution of books - and websites!
    Or maybe you should be <i>writing</i> book? And since conveying information to
    people is intended to help them, I might propose that you forget typography entirely,
    and concentrate on what the bulk of the human population is severly lacking and
    truly needs: not books, but food and decency!! Who was more significant, Claude
    Garamont or Rachel Corrie? Or Mother Teresa?! Who gives a crap about Garamont.
    <BR> <BR>But in order to propose such things I would need to ignore what <i>you</i>
    need out of life - what is in <i>your nature</i>. And I will not do that - because
    it doesn&#39;t make sense. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    a miniscule significance that is improved readability at the type design level,
    go ahead. But it is far from clear from your typical pronouncements on this subject
    that this is all about &#39;individuality&#39;, especially when you are insulting

    to confuse the final kaf with the resh rather than with the dalet? The distinguishing
    feature of the final kaf is its descender, which is perfectly sufficient for differentiation,
    especially since the letter only occurs in at the end of a word. Some typefaces
    model the transition from the horizontal to the vertical on the dalet &#40;spurred&#41;
    others on the resh &#40;rounded&#41;, a few use a hybrid approach. Zvi Narkiss
    developed a neo-Sepharidic style that tends to favour the rounded form, and I
    admire his types very much, but in SBL Hebrew I decided to follow a more traditionally
    typographic, less cursive form. User expectation is one consideration, yes, because
    the users are Biblical scholars most of whom are familiar with only one or two
    other Hebrew typefaces &#40;shifting from an 19th century Ashkenazic style to
    a Sephardic one was enough of a shock for some of them when they first saw SBL
    Hebrew&#41;. However, the other functional consideration -- and this is something
    that should be right up your street -- is that more words in the Biblical text
    end in resh than in dalet, therefore it seems  more important to distinguish the
    final kaf from resh than from dalet.'

    &#40;relatively&#41; focused meaning, concerning the decipherability of individual
    glyphs; but readability is over-loaded&#42;, with at least three different meanings:
    to most poeple it refers to the textual content, as in text that&#39;s written
    so as to be easily understood; to most typographers it refers to the page layout,
    paragraph attributes like good leading, linebreaks, etc.; and the third -most
    esoteric and controversial, but I feel most impotant to the context of type design-
    meaning concerns the font itself: the way in which a font promotes decipherment
    of boumas - different than the decipherment of individual letters. So for example
    a sans is more legible but less readable than a serif font; and tight letterspacing
    helps readability but reduces legibility. <BR> <BR>&#42; Such over-loading is
    certainly inconvenient, but it&#39;s common, and generally context -which is always
    there- focuses the meaning quite well. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; if you want
    to justify your existence by obsessing about .... <BR> <BR>OK, but I don&#39;t
    see how it&#39;s any less &#34;significant&#34; than what you choose to focus
    on. In the context of the world, they&#39;re really about the same. Does my preoccupation
    with reintroducing readability &#40;in tandem with authenticity, in this case&#41;
    into Armenian less significant that the way you choose to worry about what kind
    of pen to use for SBL Hebrew? <BR> <BR>&#62; it is far from clear from your typical
    pronouncements <BR> <BR>Yes, you have a point, and I&#39;m slowly learning to
    tame my insistence that every other type designer worry [as much] about readability
    - it doesn&#39;t make sense. On the other hand, I think I will always get annoyed
    when a type designer claims that readability simply doesn&#39;t matter outright,
    and &#40;to a lesser extent&#41; when a user doesn&#39;t appreciate the difference
    between a designer who cares about fine-tuning readability and one who doesn&#39;t.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &#34;obsessive&#34;, because I know that
    it&#39;s just one factor - which is the reason for example that some glyphs in
    Patria &#40;like the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;e&#34;&#41; have intentionally sub-optimal
    readability, to promote the &#34;robust&#34; character of the face. And like I&#39;ve

    do, and so many other people want it not to matter. <BR> <BR>&#62; you would prefer

    Hebrew designers &#40;who have an innate linguistic sensitivity that we don&#39;t&#41;
    are doing: it&#39;s not just one Narkiss font - the font in the Unicode table,
    Friedlaender&#39;s popular Hadassah of the late 50s, and every single Hebrew font
    in Bukvaraz&#42;, with the highly notable exception of the hyper-conservative
    Nathan, uses the &#34;soft-corner&#34; form. <BR> <BR>&#42; Even the super-blocky
    Atzmaut. <BR> <BR>And considering you&#39;re such a good researcher, I have to
    think that you knew about this general trend, but you either thought it&#39;s
    wrong, or you thought that in this case the spurred form makes more sense. Both
    could be valid, but the second one simply doesn&#39;t jibe with dissimilitude
    &#40;as far as I can tell&#41;, which in turn doesn&#39;t jibe with what you&#39;ve
    said in this thread! <BR> <BR>&#62; The distinguishing feature of the final kaf
    is its descender <BR> <BR>But the descender space is so weak in Hebrew - it doesn&#39;t
    seem safe to rely on it. But it depends -again- on the difference between legibility
    and readability. Sure, when you give a person many seconds to decide what a glyph
    is, there&#39;s no problem - there almost never is. But there are much more severe
    requirements of decipherability during high-speed immersive reading. Just like
    how an &#34;rn&#34; can be read as an &#34;m&#34; in English text - but only during
    immersion. And this is also why typos go unnoticed so frequently. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    I decided to follow a more traditionally typographic, less cursive form. <BR>
    <BR>Right. And my point is that to me it seems to have been at the expense of
    the &#34;dissimilitude&#34; that you claim. My impression is that this conservatism
    was the deciding factor, irrespective of dissimilitude, linguistics, etc. <BR>
    <BR>But really, what I mind most isn&#39;t that you&#39;re conservative, it isn&#39;t
    that you claim &#34;dissimilitide&#34;, and it isn&#39;t that you&#39;re saying
    it doesn&#39;t matter anyway - it&#39;s the confluence of all three!  :-/ <BR>
    <BR>BTW, I&#39;m really not trying to discredit you in toto, I just want to point
    out what I see as the flaw in the aggregate opinion/action. <BR> <BR>&#62; more
    words in the Biblical text end in resh than in dalet <BR> <BR>Yes, this would
    be significant - and it would be quite a nice refinement - as well as an endorsement
    for linguistic analysis! Is the data available? <BR> <BR>And a question: So is
    it the opposite in general Hebrew text? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>I can probably get a count of word terminal letters. Give me a couple
    of days. <BR> <BR><i>And a question: So is it the opposite in general Hebrew text?
    </i> <BR> <BR>Probably. However, modern Hebrew distinguishes tense in a regular
    way, and I don&#39;t how this is done or what impact it might have on word endings.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t rely on writing instruments to make any font. In the
    case of SBL Hebrew, <i>unusually</i>, I began the design process by making letters
    with a broadnib. This wasn&#39;t designing per se, this was research on how the
    steep ductus of Middle Eastern scripts affects the contrast pattern of individual
    letters in specific writing styles. As I explained during my ATypI presentation
    on the subject, I think it is important to understand a script within a cultural
    and historical context, and the best way to understand a script is to write it
    as it has been written. It happened, at the time, that I didn&#39;t have a broadnib
    pen with the properly angled nib, so I just used a typical broadbnib calligraphy
    pen. For the next time I want to write Hebrew or Arabic, I now have a set of properly
    cut reed pens. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m troubled that you seem to have conflated this
    initial research and sketching with designing the typeface, and in some determinative
    way. As I&#39;ve explained several times in the past, I design my types entirely
    onscreen. If I sketch on paper, with outlines, shading, a nib, or any other method,
    it is only to explore ideas about form. I suppose there might be someone out there
    who could actually produce the forms of SBL Hebrew, with their various non-chirographic
    adjustments of weight and terminal, with a broadnib pen. I couldn&#39;t. <BR>
    <BR><i>Anyway, my point is that relying on a particular writing instrument to
    make a font is no less esoteric than worrying about readability. </i> <BR> <BR>Indeed,
    and there is nothing wrong with esoterica, especially not in this business. But
    there would be something wrong with demanding that all other type designers should
    use this particular tool, and insulting them if they don&#39;t.'

    minor&#42; - certainly &#34;fatal flaw&#34; is way off. The only really bad design
    you&#39;ve made &#40;in fact it wasn&#39;t even you who made it!&#41; is the Georgian
    component of Sylfaen: its cartoonish proportions make it indeed fatally flawed
