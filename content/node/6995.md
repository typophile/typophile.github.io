body: trying to figure out how to use grays in pixel fonts here. these two families
  are designed to use black and three grays. i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s too many
  grays or not. <BR> <BR>one thing i&#39;ve noticed in working with the grays is that
  it is much easier to develop extended familes of fonts than when working without
  the grays. perhaps because the grays make nuance much more attainable within each
  character set. <BR> <BR>the following are works in progress. any feedback is welcome.

  body: 'Hey Tyler. Nice to see you get into grayscape. <BR> <BR>Number of grays:
    three is a good number. It&#39;s sort of the minimum, although the gain from using
    more isn&#39;t huge, and using more does create more brain strain. One very interesting
    thing about choosing the number of grays is how strongly it can actually affect
    the forms! When I made the first version of Mana-16 two grays is all I wanted
    to use, since I wanted to limit the bit depth per pixel to 2 &#40;to save memory
    in a &#34;true&#34; bitmap format&#41;. Coupled to ideal spacing requirements
    &#40;involving a strategy I call grayspacing&#41; it resulted in diagonal lc letters
    &#40;like the &#34;v&#34;&#41; becoming bowed. When the pixelfont aspect of grayscale
    design kicked in however, the depth issue disappeared, so I went to three grays...
    which actually resulted in being able to straighten the diagonals! It made Mana
    more conventional &#40;or maybe less unconventional&#41;. <BR> <BR>But the grays
    you&#39;re using are slightly dark I think. Are you on Mac? That causes one to
    err on the side of blurriness, whereas working on Windows causes one to err on
    the side of aliasing &#40;which isn&#39;t as bad&#41;. Before you go to far, test
    on the platform 90% of people use. <BR> <BR>Or maybe it&#39;s the way you&#39;re
    using the grays; Commerce is much tighter than Khaki. The latter also exhibits
    some bad strategy, like having solid lines of gray in the &#34;E&#34;. Black should
    be your main color, otherwise blur becomes too strong. I certainly know it&#39;s
    tempting to rely on grays as much as possible, but the practical limits dictate
    a more conservative approach; you simply have to settle for <i>some</i> aliasing.
    Also: it seems you&#39;re not using your darkest shade to full effect; don&#39;t
    underestimate its bending power! <BR> <BR>One more thing: I&#39;d make the ascenders
    &#40;in both designs&#41; one pixel taller. <BR> <BR>&#62; it is much easier to
    develop extended families of fonts <BR> <BR>Well, it&#39;s much easier to <i>arrive</i>
    at such, but it&#39;s also a lot more work! <BR>The possibilities are enriching,
    but also challenging. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hrant, as always, you give careful, valuable feedback. <BR> <BR>i&#39;d like
    to learn more about your method of grayspacing. it sounds interesting, regardless
    of how grays have impacted it. <BR> <BR>mana 16 was in fact, the one pixel font
    that opened my eyes to the extended family possibilities in pixel fonts. granted,
    craig kroeger &#40;i&#39;m a fan of his&#41; has been systematically adding to
    his main families by point sizes--something i intend to do with these familes
    as well as others. however, mana 16 really impressed me with how well the bold
    version married the regular version. i&#39;d never liked the way bold pixel fonts
    fit together with their regular weighted counterparts, and had been following
    a policy of developing single member families &#40;aside from point size variations&#41;,
    and trying to make them as unique as possible by taking advantage of the physical
    differences between them. <BR> <BR>the grays, as mana illustrates, make this problem
    obselete, in my opinion. <BR> <BR>i am indeed on a mac, and will take your advice
    and view the files on a pc, although i&#39;m not sure how to design them to look
    better on the pc. i simply picked my grays from the web safe palatte. <BR> <BR>i
    will also make the ascenders taller. i was wrestling with wheter or not to do
    that, actually. i think i err on the short side, as many of my designs feature
    stubby ascenders and decenders. <BR> <BR>thanks for your feedback on the unicase
    too, david. i like it too. it&#39;s the one with the most fun. i&#39;ll have to
    take hrant&#39;s tip and try to rework the khaki family with the darkest gray
    to remove some of the soft stuff, and tighten everything up. <BR> <BR>it is a
    lot of work, but it&#39;s fun!

  body: 'hrant, one more thing: regarding the khaki family, i was experimenting with
    using grays in situations like the &#34;E&#34; to open up the whitespace within
    the characters--or at least give that illusion. also, or perhaps alternatively,
    i was trying to control/manage the weight of the character limbs, as some of the
    glyps simply looked too heavy in comparison to the others. <BR> <BR>you mentioned
    that some aliasing was simply necessary. but what about glyph consistency?'

  body: 'Thanks for the compliments. <BR> <BR>&#62; grayspacing <BR> <BR>Basically
    it&#39;s how you use grays to push the lateral profiles slightly to the left or
    right to get more even color, and how you can allow two glyphs to touch without
    creating a distracting blotch. <BR> <BR>&#62; how well the bold version married
    the regular version. <BR> <BR>One interesting thing in Mana is how the gray strategy
    is different between the Regular and Bold, but this actually makes them harmonize
    on a deeper level. There&#39;s more than one reason for the different strategy,
    but basically it&#39;s due to the two weights requiring a different balance between
    fidelity, even color and crispness &#40;see below&#41;. It&#39;s very interesting
    how the weight of the font affects the way in which grays are optimally used.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; i&#39;m not sure how to design them to look better on the pc. <BR>&#62;
    i simply picked my grays from the web safe palatte. <BR> <BR>If you have no easy
    access to Windows what you could do is take a small group of letters that represent
    different structures &#40;like &#34;h&#34;, &#34;v&#34;, &#34;e&#34;, etc.&#41;
    and test those once on a PC&#42; to see how they should be balanced, then work
    from there on your Mac. <BR> <BR>&#42; An easy way is to put up some web images
    and check them from a public internet terminal. I do that at the local Mac store
    every time I [have to] go to the mall.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Another way to work might
    be to &#40;temporarily&#41; change the gamma on your Mac, assuming there&#39;s
    a utility &#40;or something in the OS?&#41; that can do that. FYI, the difference
    in nominal gamma is 2.2 for Windows versus 1.8 for Mac. <BR> <BR>&#62; what about
    glyph consistency? <BR> <BR>I remember what abruptly hit me about halfway into
    making Mana-16 was that there are three things that have to be balanced: fidelity
    &#40;to the &#34;intended&#34; overall design&#41;, avoiding fuzziness &#40;which
    limits the grays&#41; and even color among the glyphs. The third factor is particularly
    hard to get an unwavering grip on, especially when you use fewer grays. <BR> <BR>And
    this unique 3-way balance is actually how grayscale font design is so different
    than either outline or b&amp;w bitmapfont design. It brings in the subtlety of
    outline design directly to the screen, where it can -and has to- be evaluated
    dynamically, not after printing samples on a lino. This makes it a much less iterative,
    a much more immersive, activity. The level of concentration required &#40;a level
    that even outline type design doesn&#39;t attain&#41; to produce results that
    really use the medium &#40;as opposed to slapping on grays at the corners of an
    existing b&amp;w bitmapfont&#41; is exhausting. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    is the flipped P-shape <BR>for the uc Q. i don&#39;t know if this works - i would
    chose the  <BR>more conventional O-based-shape... <BR> <BR>&#62; mana 16 was in
    fact, the one pixel font that opened my <BR>&#62; eyes to the extended family
    possibilities in pixel fonts <BR> <BR>mana is indeed a great font... but i think
    the width- <BR>variation principle you are using has a lot more in common  <BR>with

  body: 'gustavo, <BR> <BR>elementar is indeed a fine pixel font family, and i&#39;m
    glad to have your feedback. <BR> <BR>i hadn&#39;t realized that elementar was
    such an expansive family. reason: i&#39;d never clicked on the drop down menu
    for elementar at uf.com before. i see what you mean about the width variation.
    <BR> <BR>one thing about elementar that illustrates a point i&#39;ve long held
    in my mind, while i doggedly persued traditional pixel font designs rather than
    jumping on the grays right away like many others, is the issue of uniqueness.
    <BR> <BR>before any misunderstanding may flare up, i do not mean to imply that
    elemntar lacks a unique design. i do have a family of fonts, of which one is available
    commercially right now, called &#34;nerve&#34;. nerve and elementar &#40;and others
    available around the web&#41; share the same basic geometries. their individual
    styles, in my opinion, at least in the old pixel design world, were held largely
    in the use of individual character nuance, and methods of showing curvature. <BR>
    <BR>now, with the opportunity to fill those angular nuances, once blank pixels,
    with grays, it becomes much more difficult to upgrade one&#39;s own unique character
    sets without becoming derivative of other &#40;previously published&#41; gray
    offerings. <BR> <BR>i have a few strategies in mind, but the point is, for a lot
    of old-style one-pixel-wide designs, it seems the name of the game is to be the
    first one to upgrade his/her designs. <BR> <BR>has this development crossed your
    mind, and if so, what are your thoughts?'

    by the Ultrafonts converter, can be sold on Ultrafonts, or elsewhere. No licensing
