I definitely like that revised one better. I'm thinking perhaps the typeface isn't quite the right fit. You've got a lovely vintage feel with the graphic and I'd love to see a typeface with even a slight retro/vintage feel to it.

When I think of guitar I think of script-like typefaces but either modified or custom-made logotype.

I believe you need to find a way to get the graphic to fit with the type, at the moment it they feel separate—and they definitely are, looking at your original concepts. </div>

I designed our current Script font logo a couple of years ago and I am starting to dislike it, first because it is very reminiscent of one of our main competitors, but most importantly because it covers a large amount of vertical room, making it hard to fit on some of our newer products, like 7mm diamater cabling and stratocaster pickups (check out www.tonerider.com if you have no idea what they are).  Here's the script logo we currently use on packaging but not on products.

Also some of the letter forms are just plain ugly, like the "e's.  </div>

I like the current logo, but you are right about all the guitar brands who also have a script logo. It’s good to seperate from them.

The shear reminds of the Eras family, which is a good thing for me, although they were hopelessly overused a few years ago.  

As for the sound, we do everything from vintage "clean" products to some fairly high output stuff - for example a new British-style distortion box is in the works that can really scream.  Describing tone in words is hard, but in a font.  I suppose that's why I am posting here!  </div>

Can't you adjust the existing logo rather than create a new. Don't know if the type is appropriate (i would have to know more about the product) but it is so much nicer than your new options. The T could be reduced (it is slightly thicker which will make it fit better if you reduce it (some space saved already) then you could decrease the angle slightly and get rid of pickup (some more space saved). Definetly get rid of the shear. Applying stuff like forced italics and shears is just a big no-no.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Guys,

Well, a new logo it was...and Fontin Sans saved the day.  I love this Font, a great mix of the suprising and the familar.

I mixed it with Gill Sans (can't remember which weight of the top of my head) to create one of our new products - a compressor effects pedal.  The prototypes are all done and we are working on the production tooling.  Here's a view - what do you think, font friends?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CP-1small_3956.jpg]

BTW this is a real photo of a real screenprinted prototype, not a rendering, before you ask.   I can't render 3D knobs that look this good.</div>

Are you going to have an analog delay? I prefer that to digital because the decay is a nice ethereal effect for flute. Right now I am using an old pink Boss that I'm told is a collector's item now (I think I bought it in '80). Someday it will probably die.</div>
