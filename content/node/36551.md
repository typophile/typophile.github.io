  body: "From the Microsoft Character Design standards:\r\n\r\n\"There are two basic
    styles of design for the ordinals. Some designs have a bar beneath the ordinal.
    Others do not. The ordinal version with <em>the bar is the preferred version</em>.
    ... Traditionally in <em>Portuguese</em> the ordinal characters should contain
    the underline. The underline helps avoid confusion between the masculine ordinal
    and the degree character. This is important at low resolution, such as the screen,
    when both characters are very similar in size and shape.\" (my emphasis)."
