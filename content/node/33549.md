  button to activate it, it looks as if it\u2019s activated but nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know how to fix this, or perhaps get rid of the preferences for FontLab so it wil
  behave as new, without having to install it from start?\r\n\r\nFontLab 5.02, I am
  on OSX."

  body: "Hi There,\r\n\r\nI had a similar problem with the class panel. I was changing
    it size and by mistake I ended up with a weird bar that can not be modified at
    all:\r\n\r\nSee image: http://www.re-type.com/notaweblog/images/class-panel.gif\r\n\r\nI
    have tried everything (re instaling the program, etc) and nothing changes. Finally
    I had to install FL under a different user in my computer. Now I have to log in
    as a different user which is really bothering. \r\n\r\nAny idea of how to solve
    this problem IN MY ORIGINAL USER PROFILE?\r\n\r\nI work with OSX...\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nR."

    will suggest the name \"UserWorkspace.rc\". If you're already using this name,
    you might want to use a different name.\r\n\r\nQuit FontLab.\r\n\r\nIn the Finder,
    navigate to [your home folder]/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Workspaces/
    and find the file you just created. Open the file in a plain text editor such
    as TextEdit.\r\n\r\nSearch for \"33296_Left\" and \"33296_Top\". The numbers to
    the right of these entries are the left and top coordinates of the Preview panel
    (relative to the top left corner of the menu bar). Change both of these coordinates
    to 100. Save the file.\r\n\r\nOpen FontLab. Select the file you saved from the
    list of workspaces in Window>Workspace>. If it isn't already open, open the Preview
    panel. It should now be positioned near the top of your screen."

  body: "It's not really program code. FontLab's workspace files are just lists of
    things in FontLab's interface, sometimes with numbers for coordinates or dimensions.
    It's \"human readable\" xml, so a lot of it is self-explanatory. The panels, however,
    were not so simple. They are listed with meaningless number codes in a section
    called \"@DOCKING_PANELS\". I was able to figure out what a few of them were by
    saving the current workspace, moving a panel, saving another workspace, and then
    comparing the two in a text editor.\r\n\r\nThere's normally no reason to edit
    these files directly--most of it can be changed from within FontLab--but it's
    nice to know you can."

    screen's boundaries, which is good, but the preview panel has been collapsed in
    dimension (unknowingly) with only half of the panels top bar in view, where ever
    located on screen.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Preveiw-Panel_4149.gif]\r\n\r\nCan
    the dimensions of these panels be changed within the \u201CUserWorkspace.rc\u201D
    file? as I have run through all of the 'deleting prefs'/'program re-installation'/'rebooting'
    ...etc. to no avail.\r\n\r\nThx for any suggestions.\r\n"

    also <code>33296_State 0</code> which probably controls if the window is visible
    (1) or hidden (0).\r\n\r\nYou can also try to reset the workspace by doing this:\r\n1.
    Launch FontLab and press the 'ctrl' key.\r\n2. Keep holding until the \"Reset
    Workspace\" window appears.\r\n3. Select \"Reset UI to default state\" and press
    the \"Reset UI\" button.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ResetWorkspace_4460.png]"
