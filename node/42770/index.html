<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be cruel &ndash; well, maybe I do &ndash; but if Perpetua looks good to you, you must be using it around a 14-point setting. And if it reminds you of robots &amp; science fiction, I guess we inhabit different planets.</p>
<p>PostScript Perpetua never did work very well, and even in metal it only worked at larger sizes. Don&rsquo;t look at the type as it comes off your laser printer; that will in no way look the same as when printed on an offset press.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And the tone of the book is very unique. It is hard to describe it, but I guess I can give a quick plot description.</p>
<p>PLOT: Twelve year old Cahal Anakoni Marcon suffers the loss of his father due to leukemia in 1958. He makes a vow to carry on his father&rsquo;s work at the University of Pennsylvania, where his father helped develop the ENIAC supercomputer. After graduating from college he works as professor there for many years, until he finds out about the invention of the microprocessor in 1971. After getting his hands on the chip, he experiments with it to try to create a small, powerful computer, which ends up becoming a fully-fledged robot. He keeps updating the robot and it eventually is able to talk with a 2,000 word vocabulary and even mop his kitchen. He gives the robot the name Erica, and brings it to a local science fair, where he wins first prize. The prize of $3,000 dollars helps him create some new  components and it eventually is able to do most things an average 6-year old can do. In 1985, after years developing the robot, he brings it to Armonk, New York and shows it to IBM. They turn out to be interested in his robot, and ask him if they can reverse engineer the robot to help develop some of their products. After learning that he will not get paid, he turns the offer down. He soon develops a program to help the robot learn, and soon it knows enough that they are having genuine conversations and the robot becomes a companion to Cahal. After suffering a bike accident, he does not see the robot for a few weeks. When he comes home, it turns out the robot was sitting at the counter with a cake frosted with the letters &lsquo;Get Well Soon&rsquo;. &ldquo;I just made it for you.&rdquo; the robot replied. After this happened, he learned that the robot is smart enough to help people, and soon arranges with the nearest nursing home to introduce the robot with the residents and possibly have him work there for a few weeks. After it helps many of the residents and even cooked dinner for them, the nursing home allowed him to stay for 2 weeks, after which they would pay
Cahal for every hour the robot worked. As it turned out, he worked nonstop for the whole 2 weeks. They ended up paying him $1,428. In 1992, Cahal is proven HIV-positive and leukemia diagnosed. The robot takes care of him until 1999, when Cahal dies. The robot calls the funeral home, all of Cahal&rsquo;s surviving family members and the university. After the funeral, the university asks the robot if they can research him. After agreeing this is what Cahal would have wanted, he allows them to research him. In 2014, the university announces that they have created the most intelligent robot in the world, from both their own software and software reversed engineered of the robot.</p>
<p>Pretty crazy, I know.</p>
