  town) they looks like very bad designed signage.\r\nDoes someone know examples of
  'good' design for something similar? "

    Please resist. There's a typeface called Generation that might work great - see
    if you can track it down.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Hrant, the languages include arabic and russian! I think that Fedra
    has cyrillic and arabic sets.\r\n\r\nI've made a search for 'generation typeface'
    on google and found this abstract: http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~zwang/files/papers/spie98.html
    \"Chinese Typeface Generation and Composition Using B-Spline Wavelet Transform\",
    totally unrelated but maybe a very interesting subject!\r\n"

  body: "The poster could use a dominant visual element that communicates its message
    non-verbally. It would be better than words in six different languages competing
    for attention.\r\n\r\nAnd does it have to be a single poster, or can you split
    it up into two trilingual posters, three bilingual posters, or six monolingual
    posters?"

  body: "I just remembered that Seria has a recently-made Arabic companion:\r\nhttp://www.behance.net/Gallery/FF-Seria-Arabic-First-Arabic-Speaking-FontFont/242682\r\nAlthough
    it's not what I consider ideal, it's still quite good.\r\n\r\nAnd Seria itself
    has serif and sans styles, each with two weights*,\r\neach of those with an upright
    cursive! So you could set 8 Latin-script\r\nlanguages with it. :-)  The only missing
    piece would be the Cyrillic.\r\n\r\n* You could set the Regular large and the\r\nBold
    small to end up with a visual balance.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions. Using a visual element was my first idea, because
    six languages are really too much. Below is the image I've made.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambi_3454.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    other one is to use only text in 'interesting' way. Maybe it can be done with
    only one font (using different styles, like Hrant suggests, for the different
    'voices'), or can be done with totally different fonts, one for each language.\r\n\r\nAnd
    to add another problem the arabic text can't be set in indesign. For that reason
    I think is better a font with the cyrillic than a font with the arabic language.
    What do you think of Gentium? (money is another problem)\r\n\r\nI don't think
    my client want to split it in more than one poster."

  body: "This might actually be a dream project for Fedra: Don't forget it has 2 different
    serif variants, and the Sans has an Alt and a regular version \u2013 plus Condensed
    and Display variants; and all of those come in a ton of weights, so that should
    provide quite enough room for contrasts and \xABdifferences\xBB. You've got Arabic
    and Cyrillic covered (and Hindi)\u2026 and if all else fails, you can get a Phonetic
    alphabet too. :-)"

    that after buying it I'd need a personal bailout.)
