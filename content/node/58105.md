    way? Or not? As long as it is consistent I think it's a well designed typeface
    :) \r\nAs James are saying, the s and the e should harmonize more, now they come
    from two different kind of 'pens'. Sorry about the pen-talk, but it gets easier
    to think as if it came from a pen, even if it doesnt, in our digital age."

    or not. The o looks almost monoline compared to the s. Right now, it all looks
    a bit too constructed without being a geometric face. You might want to decide
    which way to push it--looser and more fluid or tighter and more constructed and

    always get back to them in the end. And, for instance, sometimes it can be that
    the 's' doesnt work (or any other letter) but you feel it is consistent. Then
    perhaps the best is to redesign the o instead, and then adjust the glyphs after
    that.\r\n\r\nThen of course, it is always nice with a little human touch, so we

    more closely. Look too at the top of the g. It is a much heavier stroke overall
    than the bottom half.heavier even than the o. Try making it slightly lighter than
    the o.\r\n\r\nAnother thing. If you have a nice curve you can copy it & then stretch
    and skew and interpolate (option command P  on mac) it. Even though you have a
    new curve it will share some dna with the old one. It isn't always what you need,

  body: "The classic standard of beauty says that you need unity, variety, and balance.
    I think the same is true in type design. Unity can become boring, as James said,
    but variety can become visual noise that doesn't make visual sense as a design.
    The excellent critiques you got above address the problem of the design not looking
    coherent. The challenge I think is to have unity of vision that includes lively
    variety in the execution. \r\n\r\nYou need a design idea that is rich enough to
    get both unity and variety, pulled off with balance. This is difficult to bring
    off, which is why type designs that are really new and great are not so many.
    \r\n\r\nTwo interesting recent examples of those who have brought it off are:
    Christian Schwartz's [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude|Amplitude]], where
    he has 'traps' all over the place, but changes them significantly with the position
    and character; and Matthew Carter's [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Rocky|Rocky]],
    where, as I note [[http://new.typographica.org/2009/typeface-reviews/rocky/|here]],
    the 'spikes' on different letters are all different, but fit together harmoniously.
    \r\n\r\nAdded: I also find it helpful in checking for consistency to look not
    at curves, but at weights, or widths of strokes. Look at the weights of joints,
    branches, verticals, horizontals, shoulders, terminals, etc. The goal here is
    not uniformity, though there is a certain amount of that, but coherence of the
    design, even 'color' and a nice 'dance' of characters across the line. To me,
    getting the curves pretty comes after getting the weights to work, and the widths
    of counters and spacing. But that may just be my thing.   \r\n"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gaeons_5845.gif]\r\n\r\nThis has been
    covered some, and in some cases is hard to see in a gif of this size:\r\n\r\ng:
    feels a little boxy in the tail for the roundness in the other letters. Perhaps
    less weight in the tail join to eye (as in the a). Tail needs more weight on the
    right. Looks like the top pt could slide right a touch. Could be a hair narrow.\r\n\r\na:
    a little weighty in the terminal. Bowl, inner and outer curves are too disparate.
    Outer is boxy, inner is round. Angle on the tail is maybe a little much, and too
    weighty.\r\n\r\ne: crossbar is too thick. Compare to a. Also, a has very even
    counter spaces. Consider equalizing the e also. For example taking the weight
    out of the crossbar only from the top. Might be a hair narrow.\r\n\r\no: could
    be a hair wide. \r\n\r\nn: wide. Not sure about the taper on the stem. Feels week
    to me. Might need to be more deliberate - eg. a curve, or perhaps flaring the
    outside too. Then again, could be fine.\r\n\r\ns: seems a bit narrow.\r\n\r\nin
    general, i'd consider shaving the horizontals a bit. o looks ok, but g.eye a.top
    s.top look a little hair heavy. \r\n\r\nThis looks like one of the funky grotesques
    en vogue now: eg Maple and National. So don't regularize too much. I think especially
    the forms and proportions/widths should stay unique. Color aberations should be
    fixed IMO. \r\n\r\nNice going!"

    n. About the n: I wouldn't change it until you do some spacing tests. Figure out
    how big the optimal use size is going to be sort out some spacing and see how
    it relates to the o at that size. If it is meant to be used quite large with smaller
    spaces between the letters then Randy is right. If you want it to work at small
    sizes then I think you may want to keep it as is. I would leave the g out of the
    development until you have the rest of it more definite. The g is fun but it distracting.
    Designing it doesn't contribute dna to the rest of the face. I suggest things
    like d v and an h instead. Then j & y.\r\n\r\nBTW why such closed bowls on the
    e a s?\r\n\r\nI do want to be clear that the joins don't need to be identical.
