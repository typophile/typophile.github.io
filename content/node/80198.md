  of a mid-century modern feel.\r\nUsing Neutra for some of the heads and subheads,
  and I'm looking for a good font to pair with that for the body text - preferably
  a serif.\r\n\r\nThere are many large blocks of copy throughout the piece, so I was
  looking for something with a decent x-height for readability.\r\nI'm not liking
  the feel of several traditional faces: Schoolbook, Clarendon, Garamond, etc.  \r\n\r\nWondered
  if anyone might have some suggestions for a fresh serif with a lovely italic...I'd
  be most appreciative!"

  body: "While there are many ways to build a type palette, one approach is to look
    into other typefaces designed by the same foundry. Sometimes this will give you
    clues toward a possible solution. Eames Century Modern (created by House as well)
    could be a good match for Neutra, evoking some of the attitude and personality
    associated with mid-century design stalwarts Charles and Ray Eames. It has an
    x-height that lends itself to small text sizes and the italics are very attractive
    in use.\r\n\r\nI should mention that Eames has a very distinct personality. This
    may not suit your purposes if you are looking for a more subdued serif.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames\r\n\r\nNeutra
    also has a complimentary slab version as well, which would not work as effectively
    as Eames in large blocks of small copy, but may work in a supporting role if you
    want to give your publication a bit more texture without being busy. Be forewarned
    that adding a third typeface and making it work is never an easy task to accomplish.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrafaceslab\r\n\r\nAlso
    look at historical references of work done during that time. That can also help
    refine your choices in styles since you are looking to reflect that era.\r\n\r\n.
    . . . . . \r\n\r\nBuilding a typographic palette requires a lot of research, experimentation,
    and looking at the finer details, but I look at it as one of the more enjoyable
    aspects of typography.\r\n\r\n~ A"

  body: Appreciation to both Nick and Alvin - I was not familiar with FF Celeste,
    and when Alvin reminded me of Eames, I thought "of course!" Great idea!  Off to
    do some test paragraphs....
