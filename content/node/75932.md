  to be used in the HUD (score and other interface elements) and the the main menu.
  It should have a cartoony look.\r\n\r\nBooks and articles about typography usually
  don't mention nothing about cartoon typography. What is considered good taste in
  this kind of style?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to identify what current games are using
  because the fonts usually have a type treatment. For example, what is the font used
  in these examples?\r\n\r\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/042/Purple/fa/26/e9/mzl.izylhzow.320x480-75.jpg\r\nhttp://www.gigathoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/play_farmville_logo_facebook.png\r\nhttp://electronicfarmyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/logo_101-in-1_games.png\r\nhttp://www.multitap.com.br/wp-content/upLoads/pvz1.jpg\r\n"

    even so they usually are based on a font, and have only some parts modified."
