  love these posters, and I must share them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/conWeb_4965.jpg]\r\n
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/proWeb_5253.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor Graphic Design 3,
  we had to choose a political/social issue and design a poster for both the pro/con
  sides. Though the posters clearly communicate what I chose, I will tell that sex
  education was my topic. \r\n\r\nThe two sides are abstinence only education and
  comprehensive education. Both posters are directed at the middle school-high school
  kids, the age groups that are most effect by decisions made on sex education.  I
  created the type for my abstinence only poster by setting it first in Illustrator,
  printing it, and - using my handy dandy light box and pencil - drew out the type
  to give it the hand-drawn effect. The looseleaf is real, as well. For the safe sex
  poster, I wanted to really appeal to what those ages groups think is 'cool.' So
  I drew from the faux-silkscreening, tattoo imagery style that's so prevalent in
  current fashion, as well at the purse icon styling in the background. The type was
  also created using the aforementioned technique, but I used a darker color to allude
  more to graffiti styling. 18 x 24 dimensions each."
