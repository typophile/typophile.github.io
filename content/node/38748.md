  typography. Part of the brief is to explore the links between then and now. \r\n\r\nI
  was reading a post about Tschichold's 'The New Typography' from August (http://www.typophile.com/node/36098)
  which gave me a few ideas, as (from my understanding anyway) people seemed to be
  suggesting that whereas a lot of what Tschichold wrote about isn't all that radical
  now and a lot of it is just common practice, when you consider it in its historical
  context it was revolutionary. So this would seem to me to be a link - that is that
  Tschichold's ideas in the 1920s have now become common in contemporary typography.
  I should point out that I haven't read The New Typography yet, but I have a basic
  idea of what it's about from researching. I'll be getting it in the library tomorrow!\r\n\r\nI
  was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this or any other links?\r\n\r\nThanks
  :)\r\n\r\nPS I'm new here, great site, happened to come across it when researching."

    but my general impression (which would be much the same as the average joe's),
    is that the philosophy laid down by Tschichold in The New Typography is not so
    much in practice in the 21st century. Lots of design magazines I see celebrate
    a whole lot of chaos and overphotoshopped schlock. It was my understanding from
    Tschichold that good graphic design begins with good typograhy, as I'm sure many
    typophiles would concur. However, what I see today makes me think that Adobe's
    got everyone bamboozled, believing that good design begins in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nBeing
    in Dublin, you may or may not want to explore American Typography, but if you're
    talking 1920-1930, I think there's some consensus that ATF's 1923 type specimen
    book is something of a masterpiece from that era. Both that book and The New Typography
    embrace elements of simplicity and order...something only the best designers of
    the 21st century understand (which includes a lot of designers, but most definitely
    not the majority of designers).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"New Typography\" has never been popular, not then, not now, not once.\r\n\r\nIt
    is an obscure part of design culture practised by few.\r\nSubsequently, and to
    this day, the common practice continues to be either symmetry or sloppy, unstructured
    typographic layout which people think looks up to date, but lacks the pure principle.
    Just filling up space, not dynamically organizing it.\r\nThere's more to it than
    rag right setting.\r\nSure, there is an elaborate design history which records
    modernist typography, and it has a small niche in design publications -- our own
    little metaculture -- but it is rare in the mainstream of graphic design: magazines,
    newspapers, advertisements, posters, catalogs, flyers, etc.\r\n"

  body: "I feel that a lot of what Iwan wrote and practiced in The New Typography
    is still valid AND still adhered to in a lot of contemporary design. The reason
    is that one has to take \u2018New\u2019 with a few grains of salt \u2014 there
    are a lot of underlying fundamentals in the dynamic and asymmetric design he proposed
    that have foundations in history. \r\nPeople always act kind of perplexed about
    Tschicholds \u2018turnaround\u2019 after WW2, when he \u2018went back to traditional
    symmetric design\u2019, but I think that he didn\u2019t change that much, he just
    choose to be less dogmatic.\r\n(OK, that\u2019s simplified \u2014\_I am not really
    in the mood to write extensively about this\u2026)\r\n \r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

    design.</cite>\r\n\r\nMaybe where you come from, Mr. Vanderveen...yes. And maybe
    you, too, Ms. Lizmay...in my limited European experiences I've always been impressed
    with the much higher regard for art than what we have here in the United States
    of Wal-Mart. The worst part about coming back to the states is the overall cultural
    ignorance and lack of respect for art in general. But then, I don't live in a
    very culturally advanced part of the country.\r\n\r\nNevermind that... Tschichold
    = well ordered information and less ornamentation. I very rarely see that practiced.
    I can think of one corporation off the top of my head...Apple. That's about it.
    Okay, maybe a few magazines...The Economist, sort of...though I think they could
    push it a little further...hey, that's a Euro-based pub! Imagine that. Surely
    there are more. As stated, I'm a little out of touch. My neighbors are Amish farmers
    (and I love 'em).\r\n\r\nIf there is a good link to Tschichold in the 21st century,
    it must be [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte|Tufte]]."

  body: OK Liz, my comment is a bit provocative, and I would add to it that your statement
    "a lot of it is just common practice" is just as vague as the design which passes
    for "modern". Why not survey your local design culture and do a statistical analysis
    (eg in a newsagents) of just how much of it is bona fide "asymmetric typography"?

  body: On this subject I am reminded of automobiles. Back in the day automobiles
    had character, style, and presence (remember that chrome bumper of the '57 Chevy
    or that classic tail fin on the 'ol Caddy ... drool). Today automobiles are like
    everything else; they all look alike.

  body: "lizmay\r\n\r\nYou are asking about links from the 1920s and 1930s to now
    but then you introduce Tschichold as enfant terrible. Are you just interested
    in European Modernism and not the Anglo-American Typographic Revival? Tschichold
    is linked with both.\r\n\r\nIn some very realistic terms, economic and political
    upturn/turmoil have far more to do with type production from this period than
    with any specific individual or movement. This can be verified by foundry output.\r\n\r\nIf
    we have inherited anything from this period, and we have, it is the basic compositional
    standards reiterated by any and every typography primer. This is Tschichold's
    contribution, and his alone. And it is a significant one.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\nThe
