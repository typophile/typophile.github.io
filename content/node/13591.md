  at any point to 'video tape' ( outmoded i know ) / Digitally record ( w/sound) )
  \ at least the speakers and make a dvd/s available for us to buy? I'd be a customer.
  An official record, and money could be made for SOTA or whoever. \r\n\r\nAny takers?\r\n\r\n"

    year's conference in San Francisco, although it never materialized on the Typecon
    website. They were feverishly editing it throughout the event, and from what I
    saw it looked pretty neat. I wonder what happened to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt

    as a couple of edited pieces. We do plan to publish some of the material, but
    it takes time and seed money to do it right. But we will get there! We will be
    shooting footage in New York as well.\r\n\r\nJust FYI, some speakers do not give
    permission for their talks or workshops to be documented, but a great many let
    us \"capture the moment.\""

    specimen of a -skittish- saluki in Sheremetyevo 5 years ago, being put in a truly
    huge cage (she, not me) for shipping to who knows where. My only more memorable
    canine encounter was a really massive, snarling, and quite loose Great Pyrennees
    in Banagu\xE1s (a hamlet of a dozen or so houses in the periphery of Jaca). Although
    the homeless terrier mix in Plaka who refused the souvlaki I bought especially
    for him because apparently he didn't eat chicken was unforgettable too. I love
    dogs. Especially hounds; they're the newspaper fonts of the dog world.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
