body: "\r\nHi. I am looking for suggestions on a good combination of typefaces for:\r\n\r\nA.
  Headlines/titles, and\r\nB. Report/article bodies\r\n\r\nArial and Times New Roman
  are the Word defaults. If I'm not mistaken, Times was initially designed to be a
  headline typeface, not a article body typeface, which is what it has become widely
  used for. Arial just flat out sucks (fake Helvetica, grrrr).\r\n\r\nIn my own report
  writing/design, I've tended to go with Helvetica for headlines/titles, and Adobe
  Garamond for report bodies. However, my choice in those typefaces is rather unsophisticated.
  I'm wondering what others would recommend.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, Trade Gothic is
  a decent sans-serif typeface. And, Meta (see Aveda products) is a great, but I have
  not found a good serif style to match it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nSY\r\n"
