  I have been at it for weeks now, and been through about 60 faces. If you are interested
  it would be greatly appreciated. A brief synopsis of the project follows:\r\n<br>\r\nGoing
  to be used as my personal identity, long story short, i bought the domain recently,
  for it was strangely available. Current typeface is Perpetua, as it seems to lend
  itself best to letter-spacing of the faces that I have tried thus far. Also it contrasts
  nicely with the ampersand. The problems are obvious, and I have tried many things
  to fix them. The top example is an unaltered example of the font, without any alterations
  to the characters themselves. The bottom example has been altered so that all letters
  have the same width, minus the \"E\" and \"N\", for they are either too small or
  too large to be altered without destroying them.\r\n<br>\r\nI can only hope that
  some of you will be interested in sharing your advice, and I will also post a link
  to a file that has been outlined, which you may alter and then repost if you like,
  this would be awesome.\r\n<br>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/help.gif]\r\n<br>\r\nlink

    able to register the domain name. \r\n\r\nThe primary issue that strikes me is
    one of balance. The longer word \"TRACK\" on the left shifts all of the weight
    left. So, I would suggest playing with scale and positioning of the words to prevent
    one side from appearing heavier than the other. \r\n\r\nThe second issue is also
    one of balance, in a way. The ampersand is a very nice ampersand, however it is
    somewhat heavy and overbearing, especially considering that the words \"TRACK\"
    and \"KERN\" carry more meaning. I would suggest adjusting the opacity of your
    ampersand to enable the other words to increase in heiarchy. \r\n\r\nAttached
    is a JPG of one way you might aproach it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/help.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for the suggestion. My original goal was to achieve a solution that
    would take advantage of the beauty in proper letter-spacing. This might seem really
    classical, but to me, it you be a very elegant treatment. The size difference
    in the original post was done so to create drama between the characters. The balance
    of each side, respectively, was a problem that was noticed initially. Personally,
    I never really thought that it was a problem, and opted to accept the asymmetrical
    balance that it created. However, i do certainly agree that the weight is most
    certainly shifter entirely to the left.

  body: I think you might drive yourself crazy trying to create a perfect balance
    -- left and right -- from what you have shown.  The ampersand seems too large
    and overpowering, but the general idea is very traditional and nice.  Did you
    try the old trick of turning the composition upside down?

  body: many times, i have been working on this for about four weeks now. I was not
    so concerned with the thought of balance, as I knew this would likely be impossible
    right off the bat, so I just focused on creating a composition with good optical
    spacing between the letters. Now that someone has mentioned it though, I have
    begun to notice just how off kilter it is. Not that this is really a bad thing,
    but perhaps it could stand an addition of sorts underneath the word kern, something
    of a tagline, or the word "studio" or something. God only knows how much I would
    hate doing that though.

  body: perhaps i will try and make the ampersand smaller though. Again, the size
    difference was all done to try and create more of the "drama" lol, not to be silly
    or anything.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/track_kern_2.png]\r\n\r\n* reduced size
    of \"K E R N\" very slightly\r\n* reduced weight of \"T R A C K\" by colorizing
    instead of changing the size. Color has weight. Black is the heaviest \"color\",
    green and cyan-blue are about medium weight, and yellow is the lightest. The huge
    trend for a long time now has been to be a gray whore. Gray is nice but I think
    a lot of designers get carried away and make gray elements too light. Red seems
    the right weight to balance \"T R A C K\".\r\n\r\n* grayed the ampersand and colorized
    it subtly with hue 28 to make it warm\r\n\r\n* grayed and colorized \"K E R N\"
    to suit.\r\n\r\nAll these warm colors give the logo a shade more humanism. Not
    sure if that's in line with what you're aiming for.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
