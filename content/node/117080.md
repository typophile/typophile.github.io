  body: "I looked at various fonts, and can not find one font with all letterforms.
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/magistral/?refby=bowfin|Magistral Condensed]]
    gets close on all but the A and P. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-clan-ot/?refby=bowfin|FF
    Clan]] was pretty good for those two letters, but not the C and L.\r\n\r\nMost
    likely custom, I think. Does anyone know if the \xAE signifies the design of the
    logo (lettering), or just the name? I guess I have assumed it meant the design
    (implying custom lettering).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
