  be the most accurate typeface that will look like the latin family Helvetica. \r\n\r\nMost
  of the arabic fonts I see have a calligraphic gesture\u2026 I wonder if the forms
  of the arab glyphs are drawn with the same rules than the one for the latin glyphs.\r\n\r\nTo
  summarize  is an arabic font with calligraphic gesture more a serif font ? and is
  a linear arabic font more a sans serif font ?\r\n\r\nand what about chinese glyphs
  ?\r\n\r\n(My project has to include arab, chinese and latin languages, that is why
  I have all these questions :)"

    simplified Arabic, such as the Arabic included in a font like Tahoma might be
    the closest in visual appearance to Helvetica, but this style is generally disliked
    for continuous text. \r\n\r\nPerhaps you could explain a bit more about the project?
    Why the requirement to impose a Eurocentric style on Arabic and Chinese readers?\r\n"

  body: "Resist the urge to blindly impose formal attributes from one script to another,\r\nespecially
    when they're as different as Latin and Arabic. It's what we're taught,\r\nand
    it feels \"normal\", but it doesn't work. For a full elaboration please see my\r\narticle
    in Spatium issue #4, or the hot-off-the-presses issue of Hyphen.\r\n\r\nAn Arabic
    font that looks like Helvetica has <cite>no chance</cite> of conveying the\r\nsame
    atmosphere as Helvetica; at least not to people outside the insular\r\nworld of
    graphic design, not to laymen, not to the <cite>user</cite>. Furthermore, it's\r\nalmost
    guaranteed to impede readability (even more than Helvetica :-).\r\n\r\nFor a good
    instance of this... disease, look at this:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Abbar.gif

    react in an open-\r\nminded way to my -public- criticism back then.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that is what I was talking\u2026 When I talk about the arab \"brother\" of helvetica
    I think of the eye perception from a reader view and not from a designer view
    :).\r\n\r\nAnyway thank you for all your answers\u2026 That is what I tought.
    A sans serif style is always view as a sans serif style whatever the language

  body: "I'm not an expert in Arabic or Chinese but there are other complications.
    \r\n\r\nOne issue to keep in mind is that different regions/countries have different
    preferences and sometimes different rendering rules. For example Persian readers
    prefer a different style from Saudi readers, who prefer a different style from
    Urdu readers, who have slightly different rendering rules to Uighur readers etc.,
    \r\n\r\nSame is basically true for Chinese, where a particular character may take
    a different shape in simplified Chinese (CHS), traditional Chinese (CHT) and Japanese.
    An over simplification, but at the very least you should ask the customer if they
    need to support CHS, CHT or both.  \r\n"

    not totally) matches Helvetica, for display\r\nand logo usage; and another that's
    compatible with Helv\r\non the most abstract level, for text.\r\n\r\nKevin, I
    think Latinized fonts most certainly have\r\nsuch an \"accent\"; except maybe
    to those who have\r\nno exposure to the west - in which case I suspect\r\nthey
    just look like they're from another planet.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I am living in an Arab country right now, and when an arabic font is used
    in relation to a corporate identity, the logo type tries to duplicate the feel
    of the latin in every way. Arabic letters are even stretched to match the length
    of the latin letters.\r\n\r\nThe university I work for has a sans serif logo,
    and the Arabic type has been custom drawn to match the latin type. It is the same
    for most companies like Nokia, Toyota and Subway even has the little arrows at
    the end of the characters.\r\n\r\nMy university uses a more traditional, calligraphic
    type for correspondence and printed collateral. When done this way, it makes it
    easier to adjust for the regional preferences that were mentioned by Simon in
    the longer texts, and allows for easy recognition of the logo. Because the logo
    will never be seen in just it's Arabic form, it is always seen with the english/latin
    type, at least in the UAE."
