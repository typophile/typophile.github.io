		<div class="commentbody">Hi Paul <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;well this is the best thing to communicate with designers all around the world. I could never meet i greek who designs a logo for a ranch. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway my view is that you need to make less lines and more tight composition. I would propose to keep dark the width of the letters (as in your last proposal) and if possible to avoid the inner light of the fire so the flames can just be black and describe the shape of the letters. If you sure need to keep the inner parts of the fire you could maybe use them dark and the outer shape with a fat and calligraphic outline. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I realy had a hard time to explain in english what i mean and hope you understood. If not is reasonable why. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->christos</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This last post is a huge improvement. There is definitely a difference between &quot;3-D&quot; and &quot;cheesy 3-D&quot;, and this last post is not &quot;cheesy&quot;. You have a much better use of your positive/negative space. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Before seeing your last post, my main comment was going to be that I usually see brands on a more vertical plane (on the side of cattle). I didn't immediately think brand when seeing your graphic. I realize that the branding iron would probably be seen this way, but there is no handle/pole coming from the brand to identify it as the iron. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aloha! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i was waiting for you to comment. ;^) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe i should clarify a bit better. My whole concept with this logo plays off the word &quot;brand.&quot; Yes, this HX mark is my family's brand as in branding iron, but i acutally want to take the mark from the meaning it had in 1864 to the present meaning: &quot;a trademark or distinctive name identifying a product or manufacturer&quot;&ndash; Websters (not necessarily a big hunk of metal) That said i want to keep some of the symbolism of the branding iron - thus the flames and the rust-colored HX in the first post. So no one really needs to &quot;see&quot; a brand as in a hunk of metal on a post, but i want it to be &quot;felt.&quot; does that make any sense? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->oh and thank you for the &quot;not cheesy&quot; comment. i feel much better now.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like how your mark has developed. Your latest posting although simpler in design from the originals is much more dramatic. A terrific improvement. A couple of minor comments, the \ stroke of the X looks a little thin and something about the 3-d effect is slightly off because X doesn't seem to be lying on the same plane as the H. One last thought, personally I'd like to see the mark and the type relate more. Have you tried using the slab serif HX in the flame mark instead of the sans?</div>
