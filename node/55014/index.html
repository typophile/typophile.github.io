Kris Sowersby is quickly becoming one of my favorite type designers.

I'd like to see more of Cassius--I found a type sample on the web, but I was confused about its status at the time. I saw Greek characters somewhere in the specimen, but they weren't listed as supported elsewhere.


It's great to see so much wonderful work.</div>

Cassius was designed to support Arabic as well. You can find a specimen here: http://www.typefacedesign.org/2008/ Glad to see it recognized. 

I knew Klimax was something special when I first saw it on the crit boards. That type sample is so much fun to look at.</div>

On the other hand, I do see practical value in many of the winners — especially Alda, Novel, and Malabar. And as further evidence against the theory, Sowersby's two winners were both commissioned designs, so there was a obviously a group of graphic designers who demanded each of those typefaces.</div>

?
Script fonts are always best-sellers.

The hardest thing to sell (at least retail) is a serious serif.

You think it's people who buy the font, install it and just look at pangrams?
(Wow, I <em>wish</em> people bought fonts for that!)

		<div class="commentbody">It seems as if there are three things people are talking about, combining two if they want to bolster their argument. Specifically, 1) design recognition, 2) use by graphic designers, and 3) commercial success. Farquart complains that 1 and 2 don't correlate, and Stewf chimes in that plenty of 3s that were not 1s. 

I wonder how much graphic designers go for something "timeless" in their designs, which might involve using (as farquart notes) something with a more neutral personality. Witness the continuing usage of Helvetica. 

On the other hand, commercial success for a font publisher often involves convincing graphic designers that last year's typeface is now passe and needs to be replaced with the hottest, latest typeface. "You don't want to use Fnorkle Script for Shazbat, Inc., because Blah Industries used it in their ad campaign last year." Nevermind that both the Shazbat and Blah logos are Helvetica. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not how sure how commercial success should be brought into type design competitions (this one, or others). The TDC2, for example, does not require that submitted designs already have been released. I guess that some winners might never get released… that is at least a theoretical possibility. 

Moreover, since the contest is supposed to be blind, should judges really consider how successful a typeface may have already been? When you submit your PDFs to the contest, you don't include the designer's name, typeface name, or foundry name in the layout. So you couldn't well write "Dear judge, this typeface has already sold xxx copies! Love, foundry y."

Now, I guess that individual judges could look at a design, and try to guess how successful a design might be. But that is a slightly different question. Also, I suspect that "success" is defined differently at each foundry. I also think that each foundry has—to an extent—its own unique customer base. The customers that really like a certain kind of typeface may always drift to foundry A, while foundry B gets customers who like their popular typefaces a bit better.

Like Stephen Coles, I've been involved with submitting designs from a foundry to this competition for five years now. I also can think of several designs I think were submitted to the contest this year that did not win, and of course I wish that they would have. But I am sure that this year's judges had good reasoning for their choices. I am honored to be on the list of those designers whose typefaces were selected for recognition. When we all read the published TDC annual that comes out later in the year, we can read what the judges had to think about this year's entries and this year's competition.</div>

No, but I do think it's no longer a big force.

Something, yes (and you can see this among the Morisawa winners too, with the co-sponsor Adobe taking up only Fusaka, and not even Mirarae). That something is probably the age old discrepancy between culture and money.

As far as I remember, the entry sheets over the past few years have stated that a typeface must have been "designed" or "released" in the past year. I think that I can remember seeing instances of both! Many of the winners that you see each year weren't released by the time the contest entry deadline or judging came around. Sometimes a design might sit around for several years before its release.</div>

Player?

I created the TDC Type Design Competition with Paul Shaw many years ago. I have been involved with its management since the beginning. I have served as the competition chair three times. The first two years as co-chair with Paul Shaw, and once on my own when the judges I selected were Dave Farey, Fiona Ross, Ilene Strizver and Jim Parkinson. I have never entered anything in the competition since I felt it would be viewed as inappropriate. I am consulted on a continuing basis by the current board when questions arise. In the past few years I have not been as involved as I was previously. This year was one of the few times I was not present at the judging. Over the last several years (if not more) Maxim Zhukov has been deeply involved in coordinating non-latin experts to advise the panel of judges.

		<div class="commentbody">It's just that in 11 years I've never heard a whiff of a hint of an innuendo of criticism about the TDC from you. The closest I've ever seen you come is grudgingly agreeing to forward one of my many historic criticisms to the board for discussion, and only after what can only be called public haranguing by me. Suddenly hearing you say -with minimal pressure- that the results of the competition seem disconnected with commercial reality is frankly a bit shocking (if also refreshing). Now hearing that there hasn't been some sort of falling-out makes me say: kudos, and thank you.

		<div class="commentbody">I have been talking about this for several years. 

I don't think it is a criticism of the competition or the TDC at all. 

I do think there is a different point of view between type designers and graphic designers, and when Farquart posted his/her comments I thought they were valid.

As posted here, the competition is not one about commercial viability, it is about what a group of judges pick to be the best on a given day. On another day the results may be different. What that means for the commercial success of any given design is meaningless.

I do think that most graphic designers play follow-the-leader when it comes to type selection. What fonts are "The Handful of Influential Designers" using, and there you go, everyone else follows suit.

I would also say that this small universe of Typophile readers is an insignificant sample of the tens of thousands of designers working today. What goes for conventional wisdom here, hasn't even been thought of "out there", and from my Type Designer's point of view, "out there' is more important than "in here". At least it is a potentially bigger market.

		<div class="commentbody">On the TDC Facebook page--before this arose here--James M. raised this question about TDC type winners vs commercial success. I asked whether maybe there was a bias for novelty. James posted a reply that he had often heard judges say "I've seen that before" as a reason not to choose a face.

The example Stephen gave above of FF Netto I think tends to support this. Soft sans generally are popular and familiar now. For example, my local Giant Food store has just redone its identity in Cronos. (It has gone from Benguiat to Meta to Cronos over the years.) One corporate logo after another seems to be coming out in a soft sans. FF Netto is a soft sans, and it also uses the 'stemless' look of Dax and others. So you could say, "I've seen that before." But it seems to me that Netto is one of the best of this class, having softness and charm without being weak or cute. Should it have been rewarded for its excellence of execution, even if its look is not that original?

I'm not saying that there should be any rule, but it might be that graphic designers are more concerned about the best in a class, rather than what is most original in look, whereas type designer judges tend to go a bit the other way. 

I know there is something like this difference in popular vs academic writing. In academic writing the main thing is originality. It's an explicit requirement for PhD dissertations, for example. But in popular writing having an enjoyable read is the main thing. And originality is only important in so far as it interests the reader--it doesn't need to be actually original, just new to the reader. For example, Malcolm Gladwell's books are reports on others' academic research. They would not be accepted by academic journals or get a PhD, but they wildly outsell almost everything academic.

		<div class="commentbody">Re. 'commercial success': it happens that the graphic design business, on account of the kind of material that it produces and the way it produces it, accounts for a sizeable portion of the retail licensing font market. I don't think anyone really knows just how large a portion, or how large the retail licensing font market is relative to the overall market for fonts including OEM bundling, custom font commissions, etc., either in terms of number of units moved or in terms of income.

As a full-time type designer who had not had anything to do with retail font licensing for almost a decade, that market -- and the graphic design business in particular -- is practically irrelevant to me. So I'm pretty glad that the TDC competition does not seek to honour 'commercially successful' types; indeed, I'm not sure how such a criterion could be fairly judged it it were based on retail licensing figures, since the 'success' of OEM bundled fonts in terms of units moved is so much higher.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm, I'm not sure "units moved" is relevant John. When I say "commercial success", I mean relative popularity as evidenced by the number of individuals who license a font. An OEM is chosen only by the bundling corporation. As important as that corporation may be in terms of cold hard cash, it still only represents the judgment of a single group.

Whatever the case, I'm glad there are various barometers for a type design's success. Sales dollars and number of licenses is one measure, recognition by the TDC and blogs/press is another. Which reminds me: Typographica's annual list will be up very soon.</div>

ChrisL</em>"

I agree completely. Fonts that are sold alot aren't necessarily the <em>best</em> designed fonts either (think of aspects like originality, craftmanship, etc.) 
I think it's good that the TDC competition focuses completely on the design of the type itself, and not if it is used by certain or huge numbers of designers.</div>

Combine it with an ultra thin sans, matched to the "counter" weight.
Or do different parts in different colours.
Or run a script across it.
&c., &c.
