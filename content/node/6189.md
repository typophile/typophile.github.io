  body: Proper? I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d use this word. What is the use? Book?
    Lead-in paragraph? Call Out? Pull quote? <BR> <BR>For a book, I&#39;d say no,
    but then again, it depends upon the face you are using.

  body: 'Because of the crispness of this face, perhaps it would be less appropriate
    &#40;readable&#41; at small sizes. But, for an annual report... one must pause.
    :-} Maybe you could use century book for the text at 11 or 12 pt. &#40;too big???&#41;
    and lead in paragraphs bigger in the book condensed. Only suggestions. I do like
    this face. '

  body: Century Book Condensed&#39;s darkish color and generous x-height make it good
    for small text, but its narrowness doesn&#39;t... I think it&#39;s better for
    titling, where horizontal savings matter a lot. So consider something wider &#40;unless
    you happen to have narrow columns&#41;. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, narrowness
    &#40;which implies tallness&#41; does convey a certain aura of class, which is
    probably good for your annual report. <BR> <BR>So assuming you don&#39;t have
    too much text to put in there, maybe try a lighter weight of Century Condensed,
    at a somewhat large size. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Thank you Tiffany for helping me. Is there a book resource you would recommend
    for a newbie typesetter that specifically explains the type rules and layout &#40;besides
    Bringhurst&#39;s books&#41;. My friend from Germany has told me of a great German
    book on typesetting and layout. But I do not read German.

    <i>Der Typographische Raster/The Typographic Grid</i> by Hans Rudolph Bosshard,
    the text is in both German and English. I do not have this one yet, but it&#39;s
    on my list. It&#39;s available from <a href="http://nijhoflee.nl">Nijhof &amp;
