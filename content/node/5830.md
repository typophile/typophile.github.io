  body: It looks like Franklin Gothic but I can&#39;t find an exact match - best I
    can suggest is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/condensed/testdrive.html?s=RONALDINHO&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Futura Condensed.</a>

  body: Yeah I looked at Franklin, but there is too much modulation in the stroke
    widths for it to match. And the leg from the bowl in Futura&#39;s cap R meets
    closer to the stem than does the image.  <BR> <BR>:^/

  body: Actually it&#39;s just plain Condensed, not Light. <BR>But it also looks like
    it&#39;s been further compressed.
