  into detail, but I basically will need to define how my client is going to market
  their HD DVD's.  Part of this exercise will include advice on cutting edge printing
  techniques.  Think liquid foils, spot UV's, clear foil spot varnishes...the sky
  is the limit and so is their budget.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any ideas/applications
  you've come across lately.  They could be types of inks, printing processes, maybe
  even amazing papers you've seen or used.  If I can get a sample somehow please pass
  that info along as well (i.e. paper mill, magazine, or printer info).\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.  \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nPeter."

    for bright colors, satin finish instead of gloss or matte, metallic touch-plates,
    higher than normal line screen, transparent spot colors, split fountains...\r\n\r\nA
    few of these things I have no experience with. I have seen transparent spot colors,
    the ink chemists that I work with at the shop I am usually at make us these, I'm
    not sure how. We had one job in which we had to smoothly blend a series of 8 transparent
    spot colors into one another. It may have not looked nice the way they had designed
    it, but it could be something really cool if done in an elegant way. Blind embossing
    is snazzy, I think, and it isn't something done very often. Consider maybe a intricate
    pattern to give the paper a unique texture. Split fountains are neat, you always
    get amazing color combinations with this technique. You probably already know
    about adding a fluorescent booster to achieve spectacularly bright colors. I once
    worked with a project printed at a 600 line screen, that could be interesting."

    got some samples, i had it under the shower for two minutes, waited half an hour
    and it was in a pretty good state already again. you can also take with you in
    the sauna and put it in the oven or the microwave afterwards to dry.\r\n\r\nsadly
    enough, there arent too many weights for this paper, 90 and 180 only i think :(\r\n\r\nif
    you wanna research, i had the idea of using temperate-dependeable ink where one
    would have to rub over the printed parts (= make them a bit hotter than normal
    room temperature or something) to see everything.\r\n\r\none great thing, already
    used before once for a flyer (a friend told me about it): they made the flyer,
    shot photos of it, developed the photos but didnt expose it to light, put them
    in black-printed zip-bags that didnt let through any light, and if you opened
    the bag and pulled out the flyer/photo it started to develop fully. im sure THATS
    a great effect."

  body: Someone mentioned Agfa Crystal Raster screening. Adobe almost had a product
    based on the same stochastic, frequency-modulated screening technique years ago.
    I happened on a local print shop here in SF (Clubcard) that uses the stochastic
    screening for 4- and 6-color work that really gives stellar results in layouts
    with mixed photos/type/art. Type at any size, reversed, or odd colors, comes out
    crisp and fine, and photos look like you're looking at the object in the photo.
    Veer has been printing some of their catalogs using the new screening, but I think
    it looks less impressive (less sharp) on the soft papers they specify. None of
    this gives a particularly snazzy impression, but it does significantly improve
    the overall quality of offset impressions, especially using 6 colors. Add some
    iridescent foil and blind embossing and that will "make it pop", as they say.

  body: "Yes, Clubcard has an extensive sample pack to look at; one of their samples
    is also a price list, with tiny white type reversed perfectly on top of silver
    and wine-red.... I imagine they'd send samples on request. \r\n\r\nI think they
    do their printing in Vancouver, and I'm sure the presses and screening technology
    is available elsewhere too. They once told me the name of the screening product.
    \r\n\r\nOnline you wouldn't be able to see the quality; it's so fine most people
    wouldn't notice the difference between high-linescreen conventional halftones
    and this other stuff, even if they held it in their hand. "

  body: "I got some samples of some inks here a while back that actually change color
    due to environmental conditions, typically heat. One of the samples has a image
    printed on it, and then it was covered with a black ink, obscuring everything.
    When you touched it, the image would slowly be revealed as the black would go
    from opaque to completely transparent. Another one of the examples was a coffee
    cup that was printed with a similar ink, red perhaps, and it would indicate the
    level of the liquid in the container through another heat reaction. So, as you
    drank the coffee, obviously the reaction on the outside of the beverage would
    slowly move down the side of the cup, until it was empty. \r\n\r\nThis will take
    a bit of research on the internet, but I am sure you can find it.\r\n\r\nThe thermographic
    suggestion is a good one. I have seen so many magazine covers lately that have
    started to use this technique. Interesting how it's the new fad. Basically, they
    just take an intricate pattern, and use a clear gloss (laminate type overlay)
    and print over the entire cover. Think of those cheap business cards that you
    get at Office Max, that have the raised type, that doesn't really feel like ink;
    this is the same process."

  body: "Hi Peter\r\n\r\nWhat an insanely great project! Many terrific suggestions
    here, including the unusual substrate-and-ink combos, and the Crystal Raster/FM
    screening plus Hexachrome high-end stuff.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to use
    holographic foils as the substrate for some or all of the design; you could use
    an opaque white ink (possibly silkscreened) in combination with the transparent
    spot/cmyk inks to produce some fairly nice eye-candy...\r\n\r\n\"The thermographic
    suggestion is a good one. I have seen so many magazine covers lately that have
    started to use this technique.\" \r\n\r\nI think you'll find that is just a double-hit
    spot varnish going on the magazine covers... and the whole cover is processed
    on a single 6 colour press. Sometimes for a really thick one we might silkscreen
    an ultraviolet-curing varnish.\r\n\r\nReal thermography is a little-used labour-intensive
    process whereby enamel crystals are sprinkled by hand over the still-wet ink and
    then passed under a heat source to melt them and raise the surface/volume of the
    ink with a super gloss. The difference is that real thermography will crack when
    flexed, whereas a spot varnish won't, which makes it more suitable for the magazine
    covers.\r\n\r\nThermography used to be <em>de rigeur</em> for society cards and
    stationery, but like deckle edges, chromo-lithography and gravure printing, it's
    increasingly rare. I last saw it done commercially in the early 90s.\r\n\r\nLove
    the idea of sending the whole lot to the monastery, Bert."
