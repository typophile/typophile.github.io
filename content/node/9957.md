  body: I hate to say it, but I think the popularity we have been seeing for &#39;Eclat&#39;
    has a lot to do with Nick Curtis&#39;s freeware version. Evidently this typeface
    is older than Doyald Young&#39;s version, because Nick gets a lot of his lettering
    from old font books from the 30&#39;s and earlier. <BR> <BR>I think we talked
    about this with at least indirect participation from Doyald, but I admit I don&#39;t
    recall the &#39;punchline&#39; about the origin of the font.

    phine phont phorwarded by Phil --- Letraset Eclat --- provided the inspiration
    for this addition to the collection. A mover, a shaker and a money-maker, ideal
    for when when you want to make a strong but elegant statement. The name? Eclat '

  body: Thanks Sander. I know he provides notes, so I am remiss in not reading that
    one. For a long time Eclat was not available except in the Image Club Letterpress.
    Letraset had apparently never digitized it. The Image Club version even had an
    alternate version, which I don&#39;t see anywhere now. The f, g, k, r, y, z, W
    and Y were different. See sample below, which will be added to the Script Font
    ID Guide ASAP. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68248.gif"

  body: BTW, looking back at the original sample in the link posted by &#39;efthomas&#39;,
    you can see that letters from the Alternate face were used, as well as the Regular
    &#40;both &#39;r&#39; forms were used&#41;.
