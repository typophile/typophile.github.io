body: So here is the situation. <BR> <BR>I am 26 years old and I live in Baltimore,
  MD. I am a graphic designer for an Engineering Firm and I absolutely HATE my job!!
  The trouble is that in the 4 years that I have worked here I have produced no interesting
  work for my portfolio. I would like to become a better designer, but I don&#39;t
  know how. I read books and magazines on design all the time to try and improve myself,
  but without any clients or direction I seem to just be treading water. I barely
  have any work to do at my current job so I have plenty of free time to do stuff,
  but I Just don&#39;t know where to go for inspiration. <BR> <BR>This place has pretty
  much sucked every ounce of creative drive out of me and if I don&#39;t get out soon,
  then I might as well just choose a differnt career because I will be so far behind
  the curve compared to other designers. <BR> <BR>I know that this is a type website,
  but it seems like there are quite a few truly amazing designers on these boards
  who might be able to shell out some advice. <BR> <BR>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    worse before they get better. If you&#39;re sure you&#39;re that desparate, try
    this: cut your costs; work part-time at your current workplace &#40;if they accept
    - otherwise find another dead-end design job that&#39;s part time&#41;; spend
    your new free time creating things that satisfy you; travel; figure out what you

  body: One good exercise is to look around you and try to  <BR>find interesting stuff
    that&#39;s been poorly designed. <BR>Then consider it as a job to make something
    better  <BR>out of it. It will help you focus and find a sense of  <BR>purpouse.
    Plus read a lot and study design annuals, <BR>not to copy what you see but analyse
    how it was done  <BR>and most importantly why it was done a certain way. <BR>This
    is a minor step forward, but it might be a  <BR>decisive one that&#39;ll help
    you towards Hrant&#39;s more  <BR>radical solution.

  body: Honestly Eric you have three options . . . <BR> <BR>1. &#40;safest&#41; Find
    opportunities within your company to grow into a new position because after 4
    years you should have some goal where you&#39;d like to be in the organization
    instead of grunt boy. <BR> <BR>2. &#40;safe&#41; Continue to work there full time
    and look for a new full time job, then jump . . . <BR> <BR>3. &#40;unsafe&#41;
    Quit! - There is nothing more self-inspirational than not knowing where  your
    next meal is coming from. I have long held a personal philosophy that if the present
    isn&#39;t as good as the uncertain future, it&#39;s time to move on. I&#39;ve
    taken my own advice many times and never had a regret once. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    your own decision so listen to your gut and make sure you&#39;re not being influenced
    by outside forces you may resent later, discussion forums included . . . <BR>

    work someplace else!</b> <BR> <BR>You are young, but no amount of personal or
    spec work can compare to being exposed to a creative environment, working on real-world
    projects with other people. <BR> <BR>If you can save some money go back to school,
    a good school. Wether it is night classes or a graduate program, it&#39;s a great
    way to reconnect and also make contacts and develop collaboration. It may also
    open the door to a short internship at a good firm. <BR> <BR>And, as Stuart said,
    make sure it&#39;s your own decision. Take our opinions only as encouragement.

    do: <BR> <BR>1. talk to your boss. tell him what you&#39;re thinking - but be

    use the big words: you want more responsibility etc etc. <BR>what is the worst
    thing that he can do? tell you to go home? anyway you want to do that. <BR> <BR>2.
    that is to say - don&#39;t burn your bridge. maybe the new place is going to call
    your boss and ask about you.  <BR> <BR>3. never ever say - if you&#39;re looking
    for a new job - that you hate your place etc etc. People don&#39;t like to hear
    that. <BR>and your new boss can ask you: if your place is too bad - what you&#39;re
    doing there for 4 years!!! <BR>and every job there is a &#34;gray&#34; area. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>4. jump and swim - use creativehotlist.  <BR>talk to your friends. tell
    them that you&#39;re looking for a job. if you don&#39;t talk - people can&#39;t

    voluntarily ending my stint here at my current place of work next friday. i don&#39;t
    have a job lined up yet.  for some reason i&#39;m not worried about it &#40;maybe
    cuz i&#39;ve got supportive family members who&#39;ll let me crash at their place
    for a few weeks. maybe cuz i feel that things can&#39;t be much worse than they
    already are&#41; i&#39;m actually looking forward to the next chapter... whatever
    it is. <BR>if yer not doing anything interesting at work, make projects for yourself.
    design yourself a logo for your personal studio, design yourself a website, a
    business card, some stationery, etc. <BR>look on craigslist.org for freelance
    offerings - check out all the different cities for jobs that let you work from
    home.  there are bound to be some jobs you find interesting that&#39;ll stretch
    yer creativity, sharpen yer skills and build yer portfolio. <BR>above all else,

    myself.  <BR> <BR>I was working for a financial analysis company a few months
    ago, and I was feeling the same way about it. I took a little inspiration from
    Stephen King who worked 4 hours everyday after he got off of his day job. I made
    sure to set aside a certain amount of time every week where I could do my own
    thing, and catch up on what I was neglecting. <BR> <BR>I did couple pro bono pieces
    for a community radio station and a local magazine, and I used those to headline
    my portfolio and find something a little more satisfying. Or at least less soul
    crushing. <BR> <BR>Still, I have to say that work is work. Didn&#39;t Hunter S.
    Thompson say something like, &#34;As soon as it becomes work, it&#39;s no longer
    fun. That&#39;s why hookers don&#39;t giggle when you pinch their a$$.&#34; You
    are more than your job.

  body: I do a bunch of awful work for the money right now. My wife is the one making
    big strides. Pro-bono work has landed me a spot in a design annual, which helps
    while I&#39;m putting financial pieces in place. <BR> <BR>If you have a long-term
    plan, goofy money work can be more tolerable. And, what is less than satisfying
    work for me is making my clients very successful and competitive in their worlds.
    <BR> <BR>Start in on a self-promotion piece, and save the money to make it happen.
    Send your pro-bono work in to competitions, and if you get in, and they send you
    an interview questionnaire, write something nice and send it back in promptly.
    You might get some free press.

    <BR>However, the most realistic way &#40;I&#39;m relating it to my experience
    here&#41; is freelance/pro-bono. I&#39;ve got one of each, and it keeps me in
    a position where I A&#41; make a bit more money &#40;not much more, but whatever&#41;
    and B&#41; have some creative autonomy and grateful clients, along with variety
    in my portfolio. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;ve got a blog to vent a little creative
    steam. Eventually, I&#39;ll turn it into something more design-oriented. It&#39;s
    nice to have the option there for something more. That&#39;s what a lot of those
    feelings are about. I&#39;m 25, and I had a <i>similar</i> epiphany about 6 months
    back. It lead to some fun and interesting design work. I&#39;ve had to adjust
    to a different way of living &#40;a somewhat unpredictable flow of work&#41; but
    it&#39;s been worth it.

    of this thought &#40;and others like it&#41;: <BR> <BR><i>if yer not doing anything
    interesting at work, make projects for yourself. design yourself a logo for your
    personal studio, design yourself a website, a business card, some stationery,
    etc.</i> <BR> <BR>To make such self-assigned work as useful as possible, I would
    try to base that work on subject matter with which you are already familiar. Reasons:
    <BR>1&#41; Familiarity with the subject might make more research unnecessary...
    less research, more time to design. <BR>2&#41; For those subjects about which
    you have pre-existing knowledge, you <i>might</i> be able to generate more genuine
    enthusiasm... more enthusiasm, better quality product. <BR>3&#41; To those who
    have knowledge about a particular subject, factual mistakes might be more noticable
    &#40;and, therefor, more likely to be corrected&#41;, than to one who is new to
    the subject. <BR> <BR>Some examples: cd packaging for a musician or group that
    appeals to you; advertisement or poster for a sport or activity that you enjoy;
    promotional material for a charity that you support. <BR> <BR>I hope that this
