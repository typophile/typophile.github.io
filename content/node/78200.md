body: I was wondering if anyone can ID this font for me.  I see it hidden all over
  Berlin, always painted by hand, and almost always in pre-war industrial settings.  The
  letter forms change from sign to sign but the proportions are generally all the
  same. There is no digital version to my knowledge. Maybe someone can point me to
  an old industrial sign painting manual?

  body: Thanks lindenhayn, I agree it has a lot of similarities to the early grotesks
    but riccard0 is correct.  I have been on this for a while... Unless I totally
    missed something I am quite sure it is sitting in the back of some technical manual
    or sign painting book that I do not own.  Also has some similarities to early
    versions of DIN Engschrift if that helps anyone.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Engschrift_5992.jpg]
