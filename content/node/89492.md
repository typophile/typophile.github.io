    his study which you can read here:\r\nhttp://omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/boston99.pdf\r\n\r\nSo
    it's totally digital (it's selectable in pdf), but i dont get it - why aren't

    my favorite (as an admitted non-expert\r\nhowever) is Apollonia (although I'd
    much rather the\r\nlc eta descend - thanks to John Hudson for waking\r\nme up
    to that).\r\n\r\n> why aren't they distributing it?!\r\n\r\nTo make their publications
    special. Stamperia Valdonega\r\nuses that strategy, producing highly sensitive
    revivals of\r\nclassic faces, with optical scaling taking pride of place.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that Fluxus Virus is still using a system in the spirit of this 10 year old paper:\r\n\r\nhttp://omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/thessaloniki.pdf\r\n\r\nOn
    Haralambous' site, you can find a recent paper in Greek, \"to be published\",
    that was typeset using the omega system. His font formats may just be his own.\r\n"

    don\u2019t think this is a question of mere taste you posted initially.\r\nBeauty,

  body: "Unfortunately, while I think that Monotype Greek 90 is a beautiful typeface,
    I have to agree that calling it the most beautiful one of all time is hyperbole.
    It reminds me of some generic Scotch Roman face.\r\n\r\nHowever, at least it doesn't
    impose the upright capitals, italic lowercase convention of Porson Greek...\r\n\r\nBut
    I would hold Times, Palatino, and Artemisia to be superior, for example."

  body: "<cite>It reminds me of some generic Scotch Roman face.</cite>\r\n\r\nConsidering
    what Haralambous says about it, and what I find on the site of the <a href=\"http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/\">Greek
    Font Society</a>, I have to induce that the font is based on a 1805 design by
    Firmin Didot which thus predates Scotch Roman. That design was  revived in 2006
    by George D. Matthiopoulos  for a project of the Department of Literature in the
    School of Philosophy at the University of Thessaloniki and is available as <a
    href=\"http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces19th.html\">GFS Didot
    \ Classic</a> (with surprisingly heavy capitals). The Greek Font Society also
    distributes a more modern design by Takis Katsoulidis, digitised by George Matthiopoulos,
    <a href=\"http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces20th.html\">GFS Didot</a>
    (that comes with <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/texlive/\">TeX Live</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/\">MacTeX</a>)."

  body: "Could it be that the \u201Cleft handed\u201D stress of this type is derived
    from its conception for use in texts which were predominantly Latin, employing
    the typical right-handed stress of the time, and this effect consequently provided
    substantial contrast for a few words of Greek, vis-\xE0-vis both Roman and Italic?"

    John Hudson can point to something on this."

  body: 'Monotype series 90 was the best seller of all Monotype Greeks. The 11-point
    size sold 950 sets of matrices. That figure testifies to its popularity in Greece;
    but in academic use in England it is rarely seen in comparison to series 106 Porson
    and series 192 New Hellenic. Neither Cambridge University Press nor Oxford showed
    it in their  specimens, although Cambridge substituted the upright caps of this
    series for the inclined ones of Porson.  Some further details about Monotype Greeks,
    especially New Hellenic, and a specimen of some other Greek types not often seen,
    may be found in my book <em>The Greek types of the Jericho Press</em> (2014; just
    published). More information is at [[http://www.jericho-press.com]]. '
