  here!\r\nAs I see there's really good and expert people in typography field, so
  can anyone help me find the name of this font?\r\nI found it in a cemetery; the
  sentence means \"a luta\" in Portuguese (\"the fight\"), the \"a\" looks like a
  triangle. It's a pretty old typeface.\r\nPlease, I need it for a college work!\r\n
  (I already tried WhaThefont - myfont)\r\n\r\n"

  body: The age and the idiosyncrasies lead me to believe that it's probably patterned
    after an alphabet found in a lettering chapbook, probably from the 1920s or 1930s,
    and not after a typeface.

  body: For me that typeface seems to emulate ancient cuneiform writings, like on
    the Rosetta stone. Something like <a href="http://www.dafont.com/cuneate.font?nb_ppp=50">Cuneate</a>.
