body: "I'm designing a dual-column book that will have quite a few tables, charts,
  maps, and informational graphics of all sorts. The subject matter is the U.S. disaster
  relief efforts for foreign disasters; serious, academic, and rather dense (in the
  sense of detail and information).\r\n\r\nFor the body text I'm going with Kepler
  semi-condensed. One especially nice feature for this job is the caption optical
  size as this document is heavily footnoted (sidenoted actually). Could I be talked
  out of Kepler? Sure, but you better hurry.\r\n\r\nFor the tables, charts, maps etc.,...
  I want to choose an appropriate sans. It would have to work well at small sizes,
  have lining figures, and be somewhat narrow  (some tables will have a lot of info).
  What would work well with Kepler? I want to maintain the serious and academic tone,
  but this should be a little snappier (whatever that means...sexier? More lively?)
  than your average text book.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

  body: "While I like Trade Gothic for many uses, I think it might reinforce the schoolbook
    feeling I was trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nNational is an interesting idea (Flama from
    Village would also be interesting). The price is tolerable, as well. \r\n\r\nBrown
    Gothic is a VERY interesting thought. Looks like it would work well at smaller
    sizes, adds some life without making a spectacle of itself."

  body: Walburn could work for Kepler as well, as it is a bit condensed. It doesn't
    have that crazy lc g.

  body: Serious & academic? For the text, you might take a look at Stone Print. I'm
    not so good with sans, but Magma condensed should pair with Stone Print.
