  version of an english logo, now I am not sure if the R mark goes on both word marks
  or is it enough to have it on the more prominent one?\r\n\r\nThank you :)"

  body: "This isn't something that the designer should decide; your client or their
    lawyer should tell you which mark(s) to use. \r\n\r\nI'm not a lawyer but my guess
    is that you can't use the registration mark on the new version because it can
    only be used after the government registers a mark, not while the application
    is pending. You'd probably have to use TM or SM instead. (I'm assuming that the
    new version will require going through the registration process again.)\r\n\r\nThe
    government FAQ page below might be helpful:\r\nhttp://www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp#_Toc275426682\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    yes we won't use the mark now, but we're printing labels for internal communication.
    Later on, we'll have to place the R mark :)"

    may have to use TM or SM at first. The circle R cannot be used until the new mark
    is registered and approved with the trademark office."

  body: "In the second word, you have a kashida (elongation) in an invalid position
    according to traditional script grammar. You can't insert a kashida before a final
    jim. The only legitimate place in that word for a kashida is between the medial
    khah and lam:  \u0627\u0644\u062E\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0644\u064A\u062C\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I would avoid kashidas altogether in this word mark: they're unnecessary and make
    the Arabic less harmonious with the Latin. If I were to use one at all, it would
    be only in the first word, as you have it, after the initial mim."

  body: "I'm not as knowledgeable as John concerning the traditional rules of kasheeda
    placement, but even if I were I might actually shoot for -what must be- a superset
    of those rules: if it looks good, it is good. However, in this case at least it
    doesn't. :-/  You could make the kasheeda in the first word longer to end up with
    a nice symmetry, but I would actually agree with John that -at least in this case-
    no kasheedas at all might be best, especially considering the Latin is so dense.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of the Latin, there's something funny about it - it's like a distorted Futura.
    It's pudgy, and the spacing is very uneven. Also, the Latin is rather conventional
    while the Arabic is somewhat progressive (especially that 'ayn).\r\n\r\nThen there's
    the problem of apparent size/importance (marginally related to kasheeda inclusions).
    By being both smaller and lighter the Arabic seems far less important. On the
    other hand this logo might need that feature - it's hard to know from the outside.\r\n\r\nConcerning
    your original question, I'd suggest trying something that many designers would
    consider gimmicky: try making the dot of the jeem coincide with the dot of the
    \"i\", and make that the (R) sign! You might have to make the Arabic longer/bigger,
    but for one thing that would address the apparent importance issue above.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    the dots of the yaa' aren't sitting happy in relation to the \"el\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
