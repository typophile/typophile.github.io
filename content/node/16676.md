  am studying how to design my own typeface based off of my handwriting, and would
  love to get some feedback from experienced designers.\r\n\r\nThe attached sample
  is a work in progress and I have noted that I need to delete the leaders on each
  letter for better spacing and open up some of my counters to increase legibility.
  \ What else does anyone see? What features should I be looking at and modifying
  to make it more legible.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance-\r\nGiovanna Ghio\r\nCCSF -
  Grph 152"

  body: "giovanna, welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\ncan you show us some sample words
    set in this? and maybe you could post this as an inline image so it's more accessible
    for people to critique.\r\n\r\nthe e, f, k, l, and y, among others, need to be
    opened up, imo. I'm not sure if you want some of the characters to be darker than
    others ... if not, the p and q and g feel too dark ... the J and the i and the
    j feel too light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
