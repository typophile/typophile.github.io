  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone. I have will keep my introduction short because some late breaking news is prompting me to cut to the chase&hellip; I have spent months reading everything I could here, learned more than I could imagine and also became more intimidated, by type, than I could have imagined. I love typophile and am looking forward to becoming a vocal member of the community now.  <BR> <BR>Very briefly, I graduated from the University of Illinois Graphic Design program a year and a half ago. Since then I have been working doing design and testing my hand at type design on the side. I have recently decided to go back to school to delve into type design more full time and explore some different directions for life. <BR> <BR>Here is, what I see as, the interesting part&hellip; I am going back to school to work in ceramics. I am hoping to work on connections between type design and ceramic sculpture. While I was in school the &quot;design&quot; people and &quot;studio&quot;  people were polar opposites; I always walked the line between the two groups.  <BR> <BR>Until tonight I was convinced this was a unique idea. Then about an hour ago I received an e-mail from Emigre where Zuzana explores correlations of type and ceramics. Here is a short essay Zuzana has about this topic: <BR> <BR><a href="http://emigre.com/CType.php" target="_blank"><a href="http://emigre.com/CType.php">http://emigre.com/CType.php</a></a> <BR> <BR>So I don't know where I am going with this, other than I was taken off guard by that e-mail. Completely original ideas can be hard to come by I guess.  <BR> <BR>clay and letters&hellip; still exciting definitely</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That is a great article, thanks for posting Rob! <BR> <BR>I know nothing of ceramics, and I'm not a type designer, but I believe an integration of various disciplines and explorations of mediums outside of what you may be used to, is extremely beneficial in any field. I recall my first sculpture class, I had been trained to utilize tools for [and think] on a flat surface for so long and then suddenly being confronted with three dimensional objects, this was slightly daunting. I soon gained great comfort in it and only then began to understand, more thoroughly, forms modelled on a flat surface. <BR> <BR>May I ask, what made you decide to investigate ceramics? <BR> <BR><i>While I was in school the &quot;design&quot; people and &quot;studio&quot; people were polar opposites</i> <BR> <BR>I know exactly what you mean. I am in a design school currently, and the majority of the school is based on visual arts. The designers are in a kept seperate building from the artists, and neither one seems to understand the other. The designers are constantly critiquing things like their use of type, and the artists see us as corporate sell-outs (at least this is what I hear).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">ah yes, real artists and the sell outs&hellip;  <BR> <BR>I had a professor that could create interesting relationships out of any combination of elements. Her masters thesis dealt with Graphic Design and Japanese Tea Ceremony. <BR> <BR>Ceramics is my other love, along with design; seemingly completely opposite though. 3D vs 2D, hands on vs computerized, messy and emotional vs precise and rational&hellip; I see those as broad differences, yet generalizations, between the two disciplines. However, if you take one area out of context and replicate it in another environment there can be interesting results. This is nothing new, there have been nearly every kind of typeface designed: refined, proportional perfect faces, gritty, spontaneous ones, trompe l'oeil&hellip; obviously not everything though. <BR> <BR>Basically what I am trying to get at is this: I am hoping to discover new things about letterforms by working three dimensionally with them, and with my hands. I see this also as the perfect opportunity to help bring together artists and designers with this body of work. There should be something for everyone, both groups of audiences at least. Hopefully, ideally, it will be somewhat educational as well. <BR> <BR>A major difference between what I hope to do and what Zuzana is working on is that she is going somewhat farther with her comparison of pots and letters. She is finding similarities with her thrown pieces that relate to characteristics of individual letters. My focus is more literal, actual letterforms, in various incarnation, produced in clay. <BR> <BR>In regards to ceramics though, I had not yet thought about one of her points. She states: <BR> &quot;not be worked and reworked for very long, as the clay becomes water logged and stressed. A piece of ceramics ultimately exists as a static entity, whereas each letter in a typeface is designed to work in conjunction with the other letters, in virtually any combination, and so, the appearance of the typeface in use will differ, depending on the particular letter combinations and typographic setting.&quot; <BR> <BR>I will have to figure out how my work of individual letters fits in with this very important concept of type design- it IS about the sum of the whole. However, in my case, I think it the individual letter ARE more important because they are what goes unnoticed so often. If I was to start stringing together letter people would look at it more for what it says than for what it is. This is about the appreciation of a well designed letter, and the subtle differences between different faces. How many peopler can identify Times, Baskerville, Caslon, Garamond, or Hoefler if you typed it out for them? Many see a serif face and call it Times New Roman.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The essay from Zuzana Licko makes a connection I have long been aware of, thanks to a late relative who was a master potter.  <BR> <BR>I once had the great pleasure of visiting a museum's ceramics collection with her, and the commentary was amazing. Not only could she discuss just from the pot the personality and working conditions of the potterer-sometimes hundreds of years gone-but also would comment on the curves of the sillouette, and on how it was 'weak' or proud, or whatever. And when she said it, you could see it.  <BR> <BR>In pottery the material and glaze is of course very important, but to a great extent pottery is, like type 'about the curves'.  <BR> <BR>They are so close that, as Licko says, the differences are also fascinating. On of the differences is that in type the relationships between shapes is paramount, whereas in the pot, its single shape is the thing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, thanks for pointing me towards Takenobu Igarashi. I have been looking around for whatever I can scrounge up on him, hopefully I can get my hands on a book or two&hellip;  <BR> <BR>In the process of all this I came across a couple interesting old posts. It seems like art and design seem to come together once a year. <BR> <BR>2002 - <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;topic=29&amp;page=1331" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;amp;topic=29&amp;amp;page=1331">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;amp;topic=29&amp;amp;page=1331</a></a> <BR> <BR>2003 - <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/21442.html?1070556629" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/21442.html?1070556629">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/21442.html?1070556629</a></a> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>So here is the next question&hellip; How important are individual letters? What is the significance of a letterform outside the context of writing? When designing typefaces you have to create one letter at a time, and when doing so (I assume) you attempt to give it a beautiful or unique form. However, when using these beautiful or unique letters it is more important that they work together than how look alone (this is all aside from pure decoration). I have read about several typefaces that have been created solely for their legibility characteristics; I would not expect those individual letters to be the most elegant. <BR> <BR>this is great&hellip; <BR>r.k</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I studied both ceramics and graphic design in college and I always thought there was a very deep connection between them. I still recommend design students take a ceramics class. Throwing pots is entirely about negative space since the potter ultimately shapes the interior of the pot, not the exterior. All the force used to shape the pot is applied from the inside out. The outer form arrives only as a result of the interior form. <BR> <BR>As for Licko's &quot;static&quot;  refernce she's absolutely right. You can put stuff in pots and put pots in a room, but that's meaningless to the pots. They don't need the room or the stuff, they exist on their own. Letters, ultimately need each other in order to function. Alone they're just as &quot;static&quot; as the pot.  <BR> <BR>Alone a letter is only an aesthetic object. It may be readable as a letter, but it doesn't need to be. It's just a shape. A typeface requires that a group of letters exist as a functional unit so their shapes are determined as much by the other letters as anything else.  <BR> <BR>george</div>
