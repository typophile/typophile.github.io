body: i&#39;m about to begin work on a tshirt design for a friend, and am looking
  for a swashy 70s sort of face that will have huge swooshes and be rather bold. i
  realize hand drawing it may be necessary once i have the font - but can anyone recommend
  a good starting point?

  body: yo paul d to the hunt. <BR> <BR>thanks for that free face. here&#39;s the
    rough version of the tshirt im working on - ill rpbably be printing it out and
    redrawing some of it by hand, and i&#39;ll be drawing a flexing piece of wood
    as well &#40;the beauty of wood is that it flexes under pressure - not just break..

  body: glad ya liked the font Ben, it&#39;s pretty rough &#40;that&#39;s why it&#39;s
    free!&#41;, but I think with some manipulation you can really make it yours and
    make it look good. G&#39;luck with yer project! <BR>

    a T-Shirt. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d dig that
