  life at some mall. Around here they've been advertising a lot and noticed their
  new logo and thought, while nothing spectacular, is definitely a lot cleaner than
  a lot of the generican shopping mall eateries. \r\n\r\nHowever, I noticed that their
  web site features imagery of both the logo and the front of their restaurants. Notice
  any inconsistencies? ;o)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, as with any corporation that has various locations, it can be difficult
    and expensive to update exterior signage all at once. Sometimes they do it by
    region, or by A, B, and C level locations based on sales.\r\n\r\nAlso, some stores
    may have the updated logo, but marketing has not scheduled or budgeted for a photographer
    to shoot the store.\r\n\r\nThat said, it still looks generic albeit in a more
    aesthetically pleasing way.\r\n\r\nDavid"

    they''re going to so prominently feature it on their web site. ;0) '
