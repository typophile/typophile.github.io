  forgot about it.\r\nbut now i'm here.\r\n\r\nso i'm looking for a special font.\r\nit
  seems to be popular in contemporary swiss graphic design, though i haven't seen
  it that often.\r\nthe remingtons \u2013 swiss designer-duo \u2013 seem to use it
  often.\r\n\r\non one homepage one of their posters was shown and below it said \"angela-black\",
  but i checked and it can't be right, as angela is a serif font.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28468/0/page/23\r\n\r\nhere
  are the images (hope it works out)\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\noh and btw, just to be sure,
  the small typeface is gravur condensed, isn't it?\r\n\r\ndan"

  body: yeah, it has this lineto-flow, and because of this i think it could even be
    some classic but unknown swiss typeface...

    set:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/catalog/numbers/more12.html\r\n\r\nThe other
    samples look very similar to Lineto's \"alpha headline\" which is no longer available:\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Custom+Typefaces/Alpha+Headline"

  body: "similar, but not the one.\r\n\r\ni'm pretty sure it's gravur, as it's being
    used very often here. \r\n\r\nand alpha is nice too, but what i liek about the
    one i'm looking for are the \"6\" and \"9\" and \"0\" and the umlauts are nice
    too.\r\n\r\nhmmm, pretty hard...\r\n\r\nthanks anyway"
