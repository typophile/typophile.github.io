body: "Hi guys!\r\n\r\nThe past week I've been working on my very first font made
  from scratch. What started off as 10 custom letters for an illustration I was working
  on quickly became a 3-piece fontset (so far) including all possible accents I could
  find & a complete DIY-construction dingbat. I'm still working on everything, but
  since I won't be having any time the next few days, I thought It'd be a good time
  to post it here for some professional comments & advice. Please be gentle though
  seeing as this is my first time & I don't have any typographic background. I'm just
  a simple admirer whose real roots lie in illustration.\r\nI've tried to make a handwritten
  font with a monotype attitude. It's not a real monotype, but all characters are
  based on the same lines & I've made sure that the \"baseline curves\" are always
  vertically aligned so you won't get a messy \"scale effect\". Having put aesthetics
  before comfort, this adds a little to its legibility, but it's still not the kind
  of font you'd want to use for more than a paragraph. The dingbat follows the same
  thread as to be beeing semi-monotype & interacts perfectly with the typeface. I'm
  still working on some more plants, hills & critters to enable the user to create
  his very own \"candyland\" of sweet flavoured things.\r\nA full character map might
  follow some day, but in the meantime requests & suggestions will be kindly appreciated
  ;-)\r\nHope you all like it!"

  body: Some letters really might induce confusion -I know, especially the lowercase
    w followed by u might require a second look, but those are actually the letters
    I based on my own handwriting (m, n, v & w). I tried to use as little stems as
    possible to add to the fluent & elementary handwriting feel of the font.

    suggestion: do consider a slanted version.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I like it! Cute, I would say.\r\n\r\nBut, I would definately take away (or
    at least think twice about it) one of the upgoing bowls (is it called that?) on
    both n and m - so that the n only has one upgoing, and the m two. It looks like
    the n is the m now, and the m is some non-existing letter consisting of two n's.\r\nLike...
    \u201CCamdylamd\u201D ;-)\r\n\r\nVery cute dingbats aswell."

  body: "Actually, the m was the first letter I made ;-)\r\nI've kind of grown fond
    of its handwritten look & although I h\xE0ve considered taking a bowl off of the
    m & n for legibility, I just didn't have the heart to change them.\r\nI have also
    considered an italic version, but that would screw up the entire \"baseline wave\"
    & is probably way too advanced for me.\r\nI might do a bolder outline version
    (with the current strokes in white centered in thicker black strokes to obtain
    3 equally thick optical strokes).\r\nI have no intentions of putting this up for
    sale, but it's nice to have options ;-)\r\nBesides, I also included a simplified
    version of Tim Biskup's (http://www.timbiskup.com/) \"helper\" & San Rio's \"hello
    kitty\" (which -with a slight alteration in the second word- makes a fun combination
    with the turd in the 3rd row ;-p ) for personnal use. I'll try to contact them
    both to make sure they don't object to this (I'll leave out the turd part though)."

  body: "Have you also tried making the first upgoing stroke (which is not part of
    the letter really but more a movement of the \"pen\") a little bit closer to the
    following stroke than rest of the letter?\r\n\r\nThis will probably make it more
    legible, but still keep the concept.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No, I hadn't even thought about that, but I wanted to make the letterjoints
    the same curve as the letters themselves so if you type a shorter letter on a
    different line at the same height, the curves will still be vertically aligned.
    If I'd make the joints shorter, I would either have to make a real monotype font
    \xF2r settle for a scale-like effect.\r\nMight be nice for a more legible alternative
    though (one in which I could make a regularly stemmed m & n as well ;-) ).\r\nI
    haven't had much time to work on it the past few days (just a few extra dingbats),
    but I have been thinking about adding less decorative caps as well that I could
    also use in a segment (which doesn't look good & not at all legible now).\r\nDon't
    know how far I really want to take this since I originally only wanted to make
    10 custom letters, but there's still lots of things I can experiment with."

    using it for their logotype.
