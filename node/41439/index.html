<p>That said, doing this prevents you from putting several dashes in a row, and having them join (without kerning). Three ems is used in bibliographies to indicate the same author as the item above, for instance.</p>

<p>Most fonts I know of are produced with a &ldquo;3/4 em dash&rdquo;, not an Em dash, and, this may be confusing. There was no type designer present at the formation of the glyph sets to tell the techies that most users and uses were not going to want a &lsquo;real&rsquo; Em dash, so we  who need to solve problems, not argue about technicalities, said dash&rsquo;em, and made the right character, which is a full em space, with 1/8 em sidebearing on either side of a 3/4 em wide dash.</p>
<p>If you are working on a face that is considerably less wide than &lsquo;regular&rsquo;, then you may also need to consider the widths of &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;N&rdquo; as guides for your dashes, and then make the EM vs. 3/4 EM descision. The same is true in the wider direction, if you are working on a face considerably wider than &lsquo;regular&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the visual appearance of dashes for a moment, not numbers. You don&rsquo;t have to go back too far in typographic history to find the time before the em-system.</p>
<p>Visually, the &ldquo;em-dash&rdquo; was about as wide as the widest capital letter &ndash; sometimes an &ldquo;M&rdquo;, more often a &ldquo;W&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;en-dash&rdquo; was about as wide as a figure.</p>
<p>The hyphen was about as wide as a lower-case &ldquo;i&rdquo; (which was about as wide as a word space, in the days when you always added space to justify a line).</p>
<p>If you talk to an old Linotype operator (some are still living, and the linecaster didn&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;em&rdquo; system), he&rsquo;s apt to tell you that an em-space is about the size of a capital M.</p>
<p>Moving to the current em-system, the technial &ldquo;width&rdquo; (setwidth) of the dashes is more or less fixed, 1000 units for an em-dash (on the 1,000 unit UPM), 500 units for an en. How much of that inside space (ink + sidebearings) is filled with ink is your business.</p>
<p>As Dan said, you will need two- and three-em dashes.  Unless you write a kerning or ligaturing routine, that prohibits sidebearings. But, there are not many fonts I can think of where the capital M (or W) is 1,000 units. So my solution is to make a dash with ink about the size of M or W, set the width to 1,000, and make two ligatures for a two- and three-em dash, with no sidebearings, so if you need a 4- or 5- or whatever em dash, you can set it.</p>
<p>I usually make the ink of an en-dash look right with a figure, and set the sidebearings the same as a hyphen, as an en-dash is also used between alpha charactes on occasion. It&rsquo;s width will usually be around 500 units, but if that works out to 550 or 450, I don&rsquo;t sweat it.</p>
<p>FWIW</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have long been of the understanding historically, if you go back to foundry metal type (before hot metal), the em dash wasn&rsquo;t part of the typeface, but was a separate &ldquo;sort&rdquo; and was the same width as the point size. In fact, that&rsquo;s why its width was independent of the typeface.</p>
<p>I certainly agree that typeface-dependent sizes probably look better in many cases. At Adobe we still largely adhere to the standard that an em dash should have an advance width equal to the UPM, however.</p>

<p>Good point. This is also true into the age of mechanical metal type. Most fonts of that era, and up until the 1980&rsquo;s were made of 80-90 characters and all the rest were sorted in from a limited variety of options, usually 8, (sets of accents, reference, secondary punctuation and etc., though not &amp;). The upside of this was a consistent user experience with the downside that design suffered ever so slightly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, I&rsquo;m retrofitting several typefaces for OT, that have &ldquo;three-quarter&rdquo; height default lining figures.
I&rsquo;ve added a class of <em>cap figures</em> as an alternate that kicks in with the <em>case</em> feature, and am including a figure dash as part of the plan, complete with kerning.</div>

<p>I usually make a <em>endash.lp</em> &amp; switch it on with lining numbers. Also, when doing a good job, plus, minus, equal, divide, and copyright. And sometimes less &amp; greater &amp; a few other operators. Sometimes too the dollar sign, pounds-sterling, etc. etc. (I usually use the oldstyle numbers as default, so the lining sets are .lp and .lt).</p>
<p>The only real problem is where an endash is used in the text, as with (Chicago&rsquo;s example) &ldquo;quasi-public&ndash;quasi-judicial body.&rdquo; (I think an em dash shows here, but s/b an endash.) If you are using lining numbers &amp; a higher en-dash, it would stick out. If you also switched on a raised-up hyphen, it would be too high for lower case letters.</p>
<p><em>case</em> is usually no problem, just have a higher hyphen &amp; all dashes along with whatever else you want &ndash; quotes, parens, brackets, etc.</p>
<p>FWIW</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Charles, Nick &ndash; Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>There are &ldquo;case&rdquo; versions of monetaries and arithmetic signs for Whitman; they&rsquo;ve been there from the beginning. And they&rsquo;ll be switched out with appropriate onum/lnum features.</p>
<p>Substituting raised dashes with {case} is pretty much a no-brainer. The trick with the endash.uc, as Charles mentions, is that if you use a straight substitution for it with the {lnum} feature, then it will also appear in running text. Although the occurrence of an endash outside the context of a number range is not common, it still occurs.</p>
<p>So, the solution currently in mind is to contextualize the substitution with a statement something along the lines of &ldquo;sub @lnum endash' @lnum by endash.uc&rdquo;.</p>
