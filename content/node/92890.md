  someone passing by to \r\nnotice the card and know its for graphic design right
  away.\r\n2.) something i can give to someone to remember me by and \r\nreferr to
  when they need to contact me.\r\n\r\nhow have I tried to do this? I made the words
  \"graphic design\" the biggest element\r\nrather than my name. And i've made the
  card a bright color to stand out.\r\n\r\nWhy the type bleeding off the page? It
  was to give a sense of \"graphic design\". \r\nI first tried just putting it big
  in the center, but it came off as too normal looking.\r\nThe jpg i've attached is
  the front and back of the card.\r\nWhat do you guys think? Any suggestions on a
  better way to achieve this?\r\nThank you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/over_3779.jpg]"

    fast, and i can just pass out everywhere\r\ni'm probably gonna get clients that
    don't know anything about design\r\ni plan on leaving them at coffee shops\r\ngiving
    them to restaurant owners\r\njust really regular design, like cheap logos and

  body: 'To me it''s clear, you''re in design. On thing however, I would play with
    type in this kind of concept. Try to mix serif and sans, condensed or not. Good
    idea for the color. Make some other try with reverse color type on back color.  I
    prefer the last concept. Keep going. '

  body: "To call your work \"really regular design\" makes it sound like a commodity,
    indistinguishable from any other designer's work. Why not show what makes you
    unique, why a client should choose you instead of some other designer (or instead
    of making their own logo with MS Word).\r\n\r\nFor example, the logo you did for
    Cinder cigarettes was distinctive. Something in that style would be more likely
    to get my attention than the Bodoni treatment in this post. (Keep the bright color,
    though. I think that works.)"

  body: "etahchen, I am not a designer, graphic or otherwise.  I think you need to
    see this from your customer's viewpoint.  \"i'm probably gonna get clients that
    don't know anything about design i plan on leaving them at coffee shops...\"  Many
    (perhaps most) of your potential customers do not know what a graphic designer
    is or does. Your card needs to indicate very fast to someone that YOU can resolve
    their problem, give them a logo or flyer or whatever.  This card may not do that.
    Talk to a few potential customers about your card. Show them the card, and then
    ask them what services you (the graphic designer) provide and what customer problems
    you fix. Find out if the customers are understanding your card.\r\n\r\nI like
    very much the left (right side up) part of the green card. But I think you should
    delete the right side of the card (the upside down part) and provide a more prosaic
    listing of your services: flyers, reasonably priced logos etc. I don't know if
    the right side of the card should be slanted or level.\r\n\r\nI did not understand,
    from the card, that you are a person named Etah Chen. I thought etahchen was a
    company name or something. Maybe an additional line indicating you are \"Etah
    Chen, Graphic Designer\" should be added, to make 4, instead of 3, lines of smaller
    type."

    or both. It just looks like it's taking over!\r\nMaybe the space between DESIGN
    and the smaller type should be the same as the space between GRAPHIC and DESIGN. "

  body: "One more suggestion from a non-designer. I think the slanted listing on the
    right looks too haphazard. I would suggest a level listing of your services, in
    some type of easy-to-read script. I think your last card above this post looks
    good on the left side, although I would list your name on an additional, first
    line: \"Etah Chen, Graphic Designer\"\r\n\r\nAnd I would put additional info about
    your services:\r\n--logo design\r\n--printed material: \r\n   flyer, menu, book,\r\n
    \  pamphlet, brochure,\r\n   and more\r\n--website design and \r\n   consultation\r\n\r\n"
