body: It's odd that when you set the word 'Warnock' in Warnock Pro, it just fails
  because of the kerning. Any insights? Quite a charming typeface, it's just that
  I can't use it when I don't want to hassle myself with kerning every WVY etc pair.

  body: "Hello Florian,\r\nI have used a rather harsh word with 'fail', I didn't intend
    for it to sound grave. Anyway, I think Wa could use -1 , just a small thing, based
    on your sample. But when I load up mine, somehow the distance is greater than
    what you have. I loaded up Photoshop and compared what we both have, and mine's
    off by a pixel. Strange. (And that WA is a bit wide, I think)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Warnock_5841.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
    overshoots got cut off due to bad copy-paste. Haha :)"

  body: Josef, if you want to criticize the kerning, show us how you think it should
    be done -- and as David notes, do so in a size-specific manner.

  body: "The figures Florian shows indicate that this series seems thoughtfully kerned.
    \r\n\r\nAnd going beyond what Nick said I said. I think the word \"WARNOCK\" sets
    perfectly at 72 pt. with one kern. All spacing and all pair kerning is based on
    the theory of making <em>all</em> combinations not absolutely fail. Failure in
    a Sans is maybe .5 to 1, and in Serif 2-3, manual kerns per 7-8 letters?  Near
    this example, e.g. the word \"WARLACK\" might not have a \"WA\" to kern at all?
    Or that's what we hope.\r\n\r\n\"...My overshoots got cut off due to bad copy-paste.
    Haha :)\"\r\n...and your 'ar' is tighter than his while your 'no' is looser than
    his, haha :y\r\nMaybe try setting \"WARLOCK\", lighting 13 candles and zapping
    your computer's pram ;#\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    word, and I'm sorry for that. The thing is, the example I gave is Warnock Regular,
    and I did not apply any kerning changes to it. What I wanted was a comparison,
    but have asked the wrong question."
