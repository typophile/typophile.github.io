body: I'm hoping that this is not one of those "free" fonts. The price is nice, but
  they are hard to locate, since there are so many. Hoping someone here has seen this
  before.

  body: "I'm afraid you may be out of luck on the free font issue. I searched all
    300 of the ClickArt Handwritten fonts that have been bouncing around with various
    names for the past 10 years, and this isn't one of them, as far as my eyes can
    tell. I don't think it's any of the commercial handwritten fonts I have seen and
    collected. It has some stylistic similarities with Bran Willson's <a href=\"http://www.typequarry.com/type.html?sku=010\"'
    target=\"new\">'Pumpkinseed'</a>, and he has some other hand-printing fonts that
    are nicely done.\r\n\r\nAnother  option is to scroll a while through <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html\"
    target=\"new\">Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> and see if something with
    enough of the same feel catches your eye. These are all samples of fonts that
    can be found on the web, commercial, or otherwise -- just use the Reference List
    to see where they are from.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
