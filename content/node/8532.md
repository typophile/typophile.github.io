  body: If you want to quickly have a lot of specimens, your best bet is to buy the
    Font Book. One step down from that would be something like the Linotype specimen
    book, which is free. Another angle is the Indie Fonts books, which are not cheap,
    but they&#39;re nice. <BR> <BR>But even those don&#39;t cover everything, since
    a lot of smaller foundries only sell their fonts themselves, and hence you have
    to contact them directly for specimens, which are often provided as PDFs. Then
    there are one-off things &#40;like the Lexicon specimen book&#41; but those tend
    to be font true-blue font freaks. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve collected a ton of specimens,
    but it&#39;s taken me a while, and I&#39;m not sure I could outline a method to
    have collected them all in an efficient systematic way. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'i&#123;Indie Fonts books, which are not cheap} <BR> <BR>I think they&#39;re
    worth every penny! And sometimes you can get them at a discount through one of
    the participating foundries. I bought #2 through Nick&#39;s Fonts for something
    like $25 and I thought it was well worth it.'

  body: check your local used book stores too. I&#39;ve come across a few there...and
    at a good price! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'My approach: emailing them and requesting one. Like paper companies, foundries
    are eager to get their samples in front of you. Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/57409.html?1105452398">this
    thread</a> has some linked lists you could peruse for foundries.'

  body: Another good source is font conferences -  if you&#39;re in the vicinity of
    NYC in July or Helsinki in September drop by the conference venues and see what
    you can blag - better yet if you pay to attend you&#39;ll get a free bag to store
    all the goodies and get to enjoy the auctions where these things often come up
    for bid.
