  body: "Analog or digital originated, I still like Industria. It may be dated now
    for its overuse during the early 1990s. Still an interesting typeface nonetheless.\r\n\r\nBeing
    a movie tech-head nut, a number of us movie going techie fans are debating the
    whole 35mm film versus HDTV quality 2000 pixel wide \"digital\" projection subject.
    The mention of Industria and its rather ironic analog beginnings make me think
    of that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nSome analog methods are still far superior to their
    digital counterparts. When it comes to movies, IMAX and its 15-perf 70mm analog
    film format is still the high water mark for anything related to motion. Digital
    video is crap next to it. Digital does not always equal perfect. I think the term
    \"digital\" is a pretty useless term for marketing anymore anyway.\r\n\r\nTo this
    day many people designing type and type-oriented graphics often start with \"analog\"
    tools. A brush dipped in India ink. A pencil. A ballpoint pen. Mashing your paint
    stained fingers on some paper. Scan the results and then digitize them with the
    pen tool in Photoshop or do some other stuff in Illustrator, Freehand or CorelDRAW.
    Either way, it is quite a bit easier to draw for real in analog than it is to
    draw \"digitally\" using a brick and string (mouse) or something slightly easier
    (like a Wacom tablet).\r\n"

    is his web home you should write him there with a set of questions and maybe he'll
    be able to answer. There are three or four books he's published, and probably
    more by others. I don't think you'll see any rare artwork here though. and telling
    you whatever I know about him would be a mistake ;)\r\n\r\nAll the best."

  body: "<em>and telling you whatever I know about him would be a mistake ;)</em>\r\n\r\nI
    should point out that I don't know Neville Brody personally, and my take on the
    circumstances of Industria's design are, shall we say, critical insight along
    the lines of \"yes I was there too, and you know what they say, and some of it
    was true\", as Joe Strummer put it.\r\n\r\nLike Paul Rand, or for that matter
    anyone who gets the opportunity, Brody has controlled his own myth by the books
    he's published about his work. And why not, rather then have someone else get
    it all wrong? But of course, all rationalization of creative work is after the
    fact, so if you're studying someone's work, it's probably best to take what they
    say about themselves with a grain of salt, and form your opinions from a variety
    of sources. Best is to study the original artefacts themselves. Send me your address
    and I'll mail you a Face."
