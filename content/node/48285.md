  CS3. Most of the fonts show up correctly, but the one I want to use is not in the
  list. It is a Postscript Type 1 file and I am working on a Mac (OSX).\r\n\r\nAnybody
  have any idea why it's not there? I googled, but couldn't find a solution.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help.\r\n"

  body: Does it show up in other CS3 apps? What about other Mac OS X apps like TextEdit?

  body: Yes, the font shows up in all of the other CS3 apps and text edit. I am guessing
    it has something to do with it being a postscript type 1. Is there any way to
    convert that?

  body: im having this problem right now, in every other program i can see this font,
    but flash refers to just one of the fonts in the font suitcase and puts a t in
    front of the name... very strange - would love to hear if any one has a solution
    for this?
