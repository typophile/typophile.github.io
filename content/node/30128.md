body: The reason why the Renaissance went back to the Roman geometric type was because
  the Gothic style of Germany (Guttenburg's moveable type) conflicted with the printing
  methods in Italy because they believed in classical, elegant lettering. Or was it
  because of something else?

    but with cultural roots

    century Italy, in the midst of the Renaissance, because Renaissance humanists
    believed it was a barbaric style of handwriting\_(\u201Cgothic\u201D ads a synonym
    for \u201Cbarbaric\u201D). Flavio Biondo, in \u201CItalia Illustrata\u201D (1531)
    thought it was invented by the Lombards after their invasion of Italy in the 6th
    century.\r\nThe name (term) was also affected by geographic locations and other
    scripts were labelled \u201CGothic\u201D, in contrast to <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30104\">Carolingian
    minuscule</a>.\r\nAlso check out the calligraphic tradition in Aldus Manutius
    (Francesco Griffo)."

    body: well, thats what i found in my research. see, tahts why i have to have it
      approved by you wonderful people out here because i've found this theory and
      another which claims that the Renaissance refused to accept the Gothic style
      because it clashed with their humanist ideology at the time and the other texts
      i have just read say that the printing methods in Italy clashed with those of
      the German printing methods. Oh my...i feel ill seeing all these different theories.

  body: 'I think it is a bit misleading to call Roman style ''geometric''; the main
    feature is its round arches, replaced with broken lines in the Fraktur styles.
    The preference for the Roman capitals and the carolingian miniscule, which was
    closer in look to Roman caps, has to do with the Humanist movement and the fact
    that they were publishing in Latin language. Harry Carter''s ''A View of Early
    Typography'' is one of the best works on this.  Your university library should
    have it.   '

    methods\r\n\r\nWho says this? Do they say specifically how printing methods were
    different, and how this caused problems?\r\n\r\nI am puzzled by it because I don't
    see how it would be mechanically any different to cut punches, manufacture type
    and print the roman style as opposed to the Fraktur. Was there an issue of kerning? "

    body: No William, it doesn;t go into detail and i think it was Britannica Online
      library that gave me this information unfortunately. I thought they were suppose
      to be reliable :(
