body: Is there a special name for a Manuscript containing a collection of Calligraphic
  styles? I thought I had maybe heard of one before but I may be mistaken. Are you
  aware of any examples in Libraries? If you were going to try to find such a book
  what search models would you use keeping in mind a card catalog rather than an online
  keyword model? The best I can think of right now is to look under 'Calligraphy'.
  If you have a more precise idea please let me know. Thanks!

    (and related subcategories, like "Calligraphy -- Specimens").

  body: '''Specimens'' was probably the word I was searching for. As in ''Specimen
    Book''. Thanks!'

    while variations like "Calligraphy--Samples" or "Calligraphy--Specimen book" or
    "Calligraphy--Examples" have fewer hits.'

  body: Specimen is applicable for a display of styles, especially scribes showing
    their work, but I think that manual is the correct term when the collection is
    intended to be, well, a manual.
