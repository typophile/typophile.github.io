  local dialect of New Orleans, it sounds similar to a deep Long Island or Bronx accent
  with a light, sweet southern lift.  It was just blogged on Design Observer by William
  Drenttel, http://www.designobserver.com/.\r\n\r\nFLOOD BOOK is a biting, ironic
  send-up to the follies brought on New Orleans after Katrina in 2005, it is lavishly
  illustrated by  two Louisiana State University graphic design students, it is written
  by Max Cafard, a lifelong inhabitant of the Island of New Orleans.  He is a surre(gion)alist
  writer and pre-ancientist philosopher. He is the author of The Surre(gion)alist
  Manifesto and Other Writings (Exquisite Corpse, 2004) and many other works. His
  writings have appeared in Exquisite Corpse, Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed,
  The Fifth Estate, and other questionable publications.\r\n\r\n(Flood book includes
  a glossary for anyone unfamiliar with the local Yat dialect.) \r\n\r\nFLOOD BOOK
  was designed by Nancy Sharon Collins, special projects director, AIGA New Orleans
  who has an ongoing curiosity about legible type.  The following information was
  written by Emily Delorge, one of the illustrators and it pertains to readable type:\r\n\r\n\"There
  was a teachers workshop last week in Baton Rouge focused on literacy for students
  with disabilities. My mom brought the Flood Book to give to one of her long time
  friends. Dr. Caroline Musselwhite who is the consultant to the Louisiana Department
  of Education and the main speaker at the workshop saw our book and loved it. She
  said it has all the qualities needed for teaching, rhyme, repetition of lines, etc.
  Dr. Caroline requested a couple copies of the book. I went the second day. She read
  the entire book during her presentation with a volunteer to demonstrate a specific
  teaching method. She especially recomended our book to teachers in Louisiana being
  that it is an appropriate subject matter for junior high and high school students
  and also Louisiana specific.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aiganeworleans.org/shop\r\n"
