  Corey Holmes]] about the new Watchmen collateral, Mr. Holmes mentions this concerning
  Futura Extra Bold:\r\n\r\n\"We learned that the copy of Futura we own was not the
  correct cut that the comic book used. Doh!\r\n\r\nI was unable to source the original
  cut, but am taking a guess that it was a display cut that was only available as
  phototype. There was a variance in how the letters were drawn, probably adjusted
  optically for a larger point size\u2014and the main difference was the lack of ink
  traps. That ended up being the key to making the type look authentic. Whenever we
  used Futura in collateral, we redrew it so that it lacked the ink traps.\"\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone here know if there is a digital version of the display cut of Futura that
  doesn't have the inktraps?\r\n"
