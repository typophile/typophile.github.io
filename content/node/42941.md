body: "\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI'm having problems linking data from various worksheets to
  one master worksheet, all in the same workbook. The workbook contains swimmers PB's
  (personal best times)for each stroke and after each gala the swimmers new time is
  entered onto the worksheet. The worksheet data is then sorted so that the fastest
  swimmer is at the top.\r\nThe master worksheet contains all swimmers by name (alphabetically)
  and their best times for each stroke, what I am trying to do is have the master
  worksheet update automatically when I enter the swimmers new PB's in the individual
  stroke worksheets, this works when I use 'Paste Special', but when I go to sort
  the data with the fastest swimmer at the top, the data in the master worksheet does
  not reflect the correct times.\r\nDoes anyone have a possible solution please."
