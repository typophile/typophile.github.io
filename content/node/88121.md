  body: FontShop's [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/futura_alternatives/|Futura
    alternatives]] list might have something you'd like--Proxima Nova maybe?--though
    I don't know that it's been kept up to date and there are probably plenty of newer
    possibilities too.

  body: "<em>\u2026fashion oriented, friendly looking/humanized\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    an oxymoron.\r\nFashion is the opposite of humanized (at least, with regards to
    type).\r\nThe iconic fashion types, Bodoni and Futura, are the equivalent of neckties,
    corsets and high-heeled shoes.\r\n\r\nYour best bet may be Kabel, or something
    along the same lines.\r\nIn the Light weight (not available in the ITC version,
    strangely), the angular cut of its terminals introduces a complexity that takes
    some of the edge off the ruthlessness of Futura\u2019s minimalism.\r\n\r\nMy somewhat-humanized,
    Futurish style: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sense/\">Sense</a>."
