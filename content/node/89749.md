  body: I came across this Font ID request that had no response. Well, it's only a
    little over one year. Anyway, the font in question is a proprietary font created
    for the IAAF named, appropriately IAAF Sans. It exists in at least  bold and black
    variants. I was unable to identify the font creator(s).  - Herb
