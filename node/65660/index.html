  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all! As we all know, type design can be a very lonely venture. Typophile is an awesome cure for that. I&rsquo;ve been posting to the much-appreciated Critique forum every now and then and got a good amount of help. But, I think I&rsquo;ve reached a point of self-learning
saturation, and where message board help isn&rsquo;t enough. I feel like I&rsquo;d benefit from personal guidance. And still, I&rsquo;d like to use the internet to my advantage.</p>
<p>So, with the holiday spirit in the air, I&rsquo;d like to ask if any wise vets out there would be willing to coach a motivated novice. All I&rsquo;m asking for is to be able to send a few e-mails back and forth each month to discuss detailed improvements to my type design. I&rsquo;m particulary interested in developing a better eye for the nuances that crate good text faces. I&rsquo;ve been doing display fonts for a while and would like to eventually transition into making text type.</p>
<p>If I had the resources to pursue a professional degree in type design, I would. But it&rsquo;s not possible for me right now. If anyone is interested in helping me out, please send a private message. Hopefully, I&rsquo;m not overstepping any bounds by asking. Thanks!</p>

<p>On the &ldquo;a&rdquo; I&rsquo;m thinking the curves in the bowl of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; don&rsquo;t work well with the very short straight sections. I&rsquo;d either eliminate the straight elements or increase their length.</p>

<p>Koleslaw, asking someone to be your personal type critic is an awful lot to ask. There is a lot of work involved in critiquing a typeface design. If it is possible to take my SVA class on Tuesday nights I would recommend it. Not only would you have me picking apart everything you did, but the other students in the class add a lot to the critique as well.</p>

<p>That kind of thing doesn’t happen much anymore. I looked into this and it’s really hard to get any kind of type apprenticeship/internship unless you’ve got a Reading/KaBK degree, already released a few type families, or took a type design class at one of the American schools where its taught by a type designer.</p>

<p>I cannot agree here. Not a very good book IMO.</p>
<p>I also think that apprenticeships are few and far between. I teach at SVA and I&rsquo;ll be teaching undergraduate type design at Parsons this Spring, but I personally would never take on an intern or apprentice. Other type designers may do this, but I cannot afford to take the time. I have to work very fast, and I work alone.</p>

FWIW, I&rsquo;ve had a bit of formal education in type design (a part-time postgrad class) but during that same time I actually learned more here +  through books + at a couple of type conferences maybe. There&rsquo;s so much material out there, so much to learn; so much type to study. Libraries to dig through. Even just reading through the archives here reveals a ton of concepts to explore, and things to learn about. Sink the teeth of your curiosity into every bit you can get! It&rsquo;s hard, and requires more initiative, but it sure can work.</div>

Many provide workshops, which can give a shot in the arm.

<p>In the U.S., [[http://www.typecon.com|TypeCon]] may be the easiest to get to (in Los Angeles next August). But there&rsquo;s also [[http://www.typoberlin.de/2010/index.php/1/2|TypoBerlin]] (in Berlin next May) and [[http://www.atypi.org/|ATypI]] (in Dublin next September).</p>

<p>This is a very good point. And usually it&rsquo;s done quite consciously! I remember when I showed an early version of Harrier to a Famous Type Designer, he wanted to wipe out everything that I had tried to make special in it. So it&rsquo;s important to judiciously filter out certain things and keep what you really need (a tricky business for sure). Also, the best critic tries to get inside the subject&rsquo;s head and help <em>him</em> get to where he wants to go.</p>
<p>The conference idea is solid. For one thing
you can get quick crits from experts there.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the one hand, I agree with James, Nina, and Jos. In my own Hypatia Sans there are a number of elements that reflect the distinctive influence of Robert Slimbach, most notably the lowercase &ldquo;y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That being said, it was hard for me in the early days of being a journeyman type designer to figure out  when an input from Rob reflected that there was something truly &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; with a letterform, or if it just meant that he would do it differently. Most often there would definitely be something wrong, but of course Rob&rsquo;s suggestion would reflect how <em>he</em> would tackle it.</p>
<p>Mind you, in my case, the main thing I was learning was more harmonious curves and other optical subtleties, which really do have something of the absolute about them. IMO, anyway.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think someone could make a killing offering an <em>affordable</em> , but fairly intensive type design course. All the options I know of involve a lengthy time commitment and/or are very expensive. Going to Reading would require most people to leave their job and take out a loan. Typecamp seems to range from $2000 to $2400, plus travel costs. Typecon offers affordable instructional sessions, but the longest ones are just day long. I&rsquo;m not doubting the value of these things, but for a lot of people, they&rsquo;re just not an option.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of people (like me) who wold love to go to Reading, but don&rsquo;t want to quit their jobs, and would love to spend a week learning some of the finer points of designing type without having to take out a loan.</p>

<p>I doubt anyone is going to make a killing offering any kind of type design course.</p>
<p>The one I teach at SVA Continuing Ed is 12 weeks at 3 hours per session for $470. I don&rsquo;t think anyone could teach a course for much less than that. Last semester I had 6 students, the bare minimum for keeping the course open. So far there is one person signed up for next semester.</p>
<p>The Typophile bubble may be at play here. Learning how to design type may be of great interest to the small group of folks who regularly read Typophile, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much of a draw to the general design population. They&rsquo;re more interested in acquiring type then they are learning to create it.</p>

What it would cost I cannot say, but it would probably be under $600.

<p>Pretty much all I&rsquo;ve learned about type design has come from the forums here, plus a very few books and some online research. Still, I would like to learn more and have thought about the Reading course from time to time, both for its technical and social aspects. However, as Jonathan rightly points out above, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in a position to stop working for a year. I guess it boils down to how serious you are about studying — I&rsquo;m only a hobbyist and learning at my own pace suits me for now. I&rsquo;m very grateful for the crit board here.</p>

<p>There must be integrated software that can put you in one window and the shared screen in another, but I haven&rsquo;t looked further.</p>
<p>Christian Schwartz often designs type with collaborators abroad, so I suspect he can tell you good solutions for doing this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve got a bit of experience in this area &hellip; I create online courses for a living as an instructional designer at an Ontario community college.</p>
<p>There are three software tools we use (all have competitors). One is Elluminate, which allows real-time conferencing. The beauty of this is that it allows up to 24 students and a teacher (more with a higher licence) to meet and discuss things. As mentioned, the instructor can share software on his computer, or allow a student to share his software. This means the student can <em>do</em> the thing that s/he is having trouble with, and the instructor can see what the problem is, usually instantly if it is a rookie mistake.</p>
<p>Theoretically all classes could be done with this software, but in fact I only recommend it for an initial meeting, and for remedial help. The reason is that the biggest benefit of online instruction is the ability to work to your own schedule, and having a fixed meeting time elliminates this. (The software does allow a session to be recorded, which means those who can&rsquo;t make the session can watch the replay, and also this means that if a student is having trouble with a point that last year&rsquo;s class also had trouble with, the teacher has them watch the tape of last years remedial, and  only has another one if they still have trouble.)</p>
<p>The second key piece of software we use is something called Captivate. This allows you to build tutorials where your computer screen is recorded, along with your voice (and any annotations you want to add to the screen later). This software, or something similar, is what they use to do the Lynda.com tutorials, if you are familiar with those.</p>
<p>Finally, you need a learning management system. We use Angel, although WebCT, Blackboard, and Desire2Learn are commercial competitors, and Moodle and Sakai are the open source alternatives. These are course management tools and handle internal email, testing and marks, and holding the files. If you are working with a college or university, they should have one of these and will give you a course shell. If not, and you have strong software skills (can set up a server, for instance) then Moodle will work for you.</p>
<p>(Thanks to hrant for pointing this thread out to me &hellip; I&rsquo;ve been off this week &hellip; it is rough working in education &hellip; and not following the threads).</p>

<p>Are any of these suitable for recording conference presentations also&ndash;with simultaneous windows for the presenter and slides?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, Elluminate does have a function so that a video of the presenter can be seen, generally a face shot. But the software does not seem to be designed for recording conference type presentations.</p>
<p>Camtasia could easily record a presentation screen, though, and another camera could record a presenter. Then it would be fairly trivial to marry the two together in Premiere or something.</p>
