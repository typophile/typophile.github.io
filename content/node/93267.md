  body: "The legality is likely to be an issue if the name has been trademarked but
    others here would be able to give you more feedback on that. A bigger concern
    should probably be confusion as you would immediately find yourself potentially
    losing focus on your typeface in favour of the other one available.\r\n\r\nI remember
    a comment made elsewhere on this site about the possibility of naming typefaces
    after Autechre track names and I think 65daysofstatic and Godspeed You! Black
    Emperor would be fertile territory for similar inspiration, just in the field
    of music; literature, art or a copy of the OED (or perhaps rather ADL) would prove
    just as inspirational. I am not suggesting that you should abandon your considered
    name but there are so many unexplored possibilities and something unique is likely
    to be beneficial in drawing attention to your font."

  body: "In the case of nouvelle vague the fonts are named after a film style. I think
    there is generally a difference between copying original names and copying names
    that borrow from something else, especially if your inspiration doesn't come from
    the other font. Similarly, one could call a font Flutter or Tilapia (which are
    tracks by Autechre) without any problems, but I'd be more cautious with calling
    it Maphive 6.1.\r\nKarl Stange, I'm curious to know what track name's this person
    was thinking of. Nothing particularly fitting comes to mind. (Except maybe The
    Egg as an alt. name for Hobo.)"

  body: "Thijs, I think it was posited as a general idea, to try and escape the typical
    conventions of font naming. I do not know if they had specific tracks in mind.\r\n\r\nFrom
    a casual glance at a track listing, \"Tankakern\", \"Ipacial\" (partial) and \"Augmatic
    Disport\" jump out as good candidates. I liked the idea of \"East Hastings\" or
    \"Moya\" from Godspeed and \"Tiger Girl\" and \"Retreat, Retreat\" from 65daysofstatic,
    but more from an arbitrary impressionistic point of view, rather than relating
    to aspects of typography or fonts."

  body: I don't think that would be a problem at all. Maybe, for uniqueness, you could
    add something to the name.

    EU authorship legislation grants the author\u2019s rights even without registering
    anything (in the US it isn't the case), if precedence can be proven. \r\nAdding
    something to your name would save you from any possible issue. "

  body: "Trademark doesn't need to be registered and can be based solely on established
    usage in the marketplace, and note that marketplace in this instance doesn't imply
    commercial: a free font name can still be considered a trademark, since the purpose
    of trademarks is to avoid confusion of products and providers in the marketplace.
    So if you introduce a product with the same name into the marketplace, that may
    be considered trademark violation, regardless of whether the other product is
    commercial or free. Whether the maker of the free font would take the time and
    expense to defend the trademark by bringing a lawsuit against you is another matter.
    Perhaps more to the point though is that you might have trouble claiming the trademark
    for yourself, since there is established prior use in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nAs
    a general rule: when in doubt about such a question ask a lawyer, not a bunch
    of typographers on the interwebs.\r\n\r\n[Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, and the
    above is not offered as legal advice.]"

  body: "Karl\u2019s advice is sound. Forget about legality: why muddy the water and
    create confusion for potential buyers? I know from personal experience\u2014I
    recycled one of my own freeware font names and used it for a commercial release\u2014that
    the process can produce a few unhappy campers.\r\n\r\nA quick Google search suggests
    that the name \u201CMegawatt\u201D isn\u2019t being currently used for a typeface;
    use it\u2014or something like it\u2014instead. Same basic idea, lots more punch\u2026"
