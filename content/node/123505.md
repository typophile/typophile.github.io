  experts,\r\n \r\nThe Japanese Ninokuni for Nintendo DS use some NDS fonts.\r\nIn
  one of these japanese fonts, the 12 pixels one, i have found some latin chars, that
  the game doesn't use.\r\n\r\nThe 'b', 'd', 'f' or 'l' look like a serif curved font,
  but the capital ones don't.\r\nDoes Nintendo buy/convert a well known ttf font for
  the game ?\r\nI want to find closest fonts for a website.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n"
