  body: I'm not a logo designer but the eggs don't look egg shaped. Grab an egg out
    of the fridge and really look. The gg would be easier to see if the waistline
    were lower too. I would draw a line around an egg with a Sharpie. Then I'd photograph
    it from a slightly downward angle and trace it . . . or get someone else to do
    it.

  body: "Really? Do all that to get the shape of an egg?\r\n\r\nI think trying to
    create a perfect egg shape is irrelevant and a waste of time. Capturing the general
    idea of the shape, which you have done, is enough."

  body: "I think the \"a bakery\" throws it off a lot. Makes it sound too generic.\r\n\r\nAlso
    considering rounding the corner of the crossbar of the /e/ or making the terminal
    on the tail of the /e/ as pointy as the crossbar joint."

    \ \r\n\r\nFirst of all, it's not readable. It just doesn't say \"egg\" no matter
    how much you want it to. It says eee. \r\n\r\nIf you are stuck on the concept
    of backwards ees to create the gees, you'll have to lower the backward ees so
    they're on the baseline like a regular gee. Otherwise, just use normal gees; which,
    by the way, if by far the most elegant and adored letter in the alphabet so I
    can't fathom why you'd avoid using them. \r\n\r\nBut, before you work further
    on the backwards e concept, what is the point of all the ees? Is the ee somehow
    related to the bakery? If not, why the gimmick? IMO, it doesn't add anything other
    than confusion. \r\n\r\nThe gradients are, well, just absolutely awful and frankly,
    the mark of an amateur designer trying too hard. Gradients don't make something
    look better arbitrarily. They have to have a purpose, and here, they just don't.
    Same goes for the box frame. Why is it there? \r\n\r\nThe very first thing I was
    taught in my first logo development class was to work in black and white ONLY
    and then add color later --- but for the love of Pete, don't fill in the letters
    with a color that just abruptly ends at the openings. It looks very, very odd
    and pulls the eye to it like an ink stain on a white shirt. The yellow stops inexplicably,
    like it should fall out of the ee but it somehow defies gravity. \r\n\r\nScale
    is a big problem. If you scale it down to fit on a business card, the tag line
    becomes way too small to read. This is much more important than you might think,
    because logos need to be versatile enough to work on everything from signage and
    menus to receipts and business checks. This wouldn't be readable on checks, especially.
    It would just say \"eee\" and probably confuse people without a magnifying glass.
    \r\n\r\nOh, and just for the record, I think typodermic's suggestion is a good
    one. There is no better way to get organic shapes than to start with a photo of
    the actual organic shape!"

    agree with everything he said above. Try cutting it down so we can see the basic
    black & white logo without all the other stuff. And try replicating the shape
    of a /g/ (just a single-story) instead of just flipping the /e/. Good luck."
