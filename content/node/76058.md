body: "Ever since a friend showed me what he called a \"pic\xF3metro\" in Spanish,
  I have been fond of the typescale as a tool particular to the craft of typography,
  and sure enough over the years I have found it pretty handy for page design and
  adjustments, even if mostly to compare against the measures in the computer file.
  \r\n\r\nSomeone must keep buying typescales, since they seem to be persistently
  in stock (in art shops in the UK, and I came across one in Dubai not long ago),
  but I wonder, how useful are they considered by the typophiles? What use are they
  generally given in these digital times? \r\n\r\nAnd is there a particular typescale
  that can be recommended or deprecated? So far I am acquainted with:\r\n\r\n--Caxton
  typescale\r\n--Linex DTP 30\r\n--ruler.tex (as found in http://tug.ctan.org/)\r\n--Depth
  Scale (Technical Sales, London)\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this last one (I just got)
  appears to be seriously wrong in its measures. Anyone who can comment on this?\r\n\r\nServus!\r\nJuan"

  body: "It is true that type scales are used less these days, because so much of
    typesetting is done digitally.\r\n\r\nAlso, laser photocopiers might enlarge by
    4% or so as a precaution against counterfeiting. Even if laser printers don't
    do that, I wouldn't be surprised if computer systems would tend to start with
    a point size of exactly 1/72 inches, and then round it to the nearest multiple
    of 1/300 inch for most laser printers, and then the laser printer would actually
    print in units of 2.5 centimeters divided by 300, not one inch divided by 300.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you don't live in an English-speaking country, any type scale you are likely
    to encounter would be in Didot points.\r\n\r\nSo I can think of all sorts of things
    that could go wrong."
