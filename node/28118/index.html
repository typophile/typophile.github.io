  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Based on an idea by master printer Gerald Lange, The MicroFoundry
has designed and arranged for the manufacture of a unique piece of
special-interest furniture: the TypeTable.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1s_4623.jpg]

Essentially a glass-top coffee table that gracefully accommodates a drawer
of letterpress type, the TypeTable nicely exhibits an instance of high craft
for discernment by the typographic aficionado, and is itself crafted to high
standards: sturdy but elegant construction, to a tolerance of 1/32 of an inch;
1/2-inch beveled glass; and easy movement of the type drawer into and out
of the framework, ensuring that the font is not converted into a "museum
piece" but instead remains a dignified, usable resource. <cite>Note that the purchase
of the TypeTable does not include a drawer of type; this must be provided by
the customer, although The MicroFoundry would gladly help in procuring a drawer.</cite>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2s_5146.jpg]

With the drawer of type removed, the table reveals its attractive lattice
midboard, which can be used to exhibit other items (up to 1-1/2 inches in
height) making this piece of "typographic furniture" highly versatile.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7s_4870.jpg]

The TypeTable has dimensions of 36×18×18 inches, and is offered for sale at
US$555 (plus delivery costs). It is manufactured on a first-come, first-served
basis. Please direct all inquiries (including interest in tables that accommodate
more than one drawer) to Hrant Papazian: hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com

for what it's worth, you could probably get a whole rack of empty 'drawers' for the price, and be able to lay new type in for use. i know, it's big commitment. 

in any case..., if you need to get into some drawers, i have a number of grotty trays available at $20 +shipping. i'll add nifty looking vintage print letters for $10... pi is chefs choice.

So Michael, still sore about the Palatino broadside debacle?  ;-)

Actually at my parents' house there's a typecase on a wall full of Dungeons & Dragons miniatures that I painted over my teen years. In fact now that I think about it (not to mention that I actually know what a California job case is and looks like) it must have been a typecase for Arabic type - it has a lot of smaller compartments instead of many really small and really large ones.

		<div class="commentbody">hi Hrant,

i don't recall the debacle. so, no, i suppose i'm not. . . (i'm thinking hard about it. i know i had done a broadside in 54pt a lonnng time ago. rebacle it for me?)

your folk's case could have been any number of arrangements. all-cap cases have equal sized compartments. of course i suppose it depends on where it came from.

anyway, it IS a handsome table, however, you see what happens when you remove cases from their native environment/raison d'etre. the price becomes obscene. i'm still astounded. the most i had ever heard was $35, and i actually thought that was a phase that had been passed through. apparently not.

Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. Plus I was actually on your side.

My parents' case, originally a gift to me from my brother's mother-in-law-to-be, is from/in Lebanon, and did have variance in compartment size, but it seems to me not as much as the letter frequencies of Latinate scripts would require. I'm guessing it was for Arabic type because Arabic has four cases per letter (for most of its letters) and that "flattens" the required sort frequencies - but it's just a guess.

Yes, and more than the valuation issue of the case I mind that the <cite>font</cite> could be affected negatively: it might become sort of a circus act, losing its dignified standing as a useful thing. BUT that really depends on the customer/user - sort of like how a kitchen knife could be used to cook or kill.

The fact that I agree with you on this to some extent is why:
1) It was very important to me to make the case as easy to pull out as it would be from a typecase stand/cabinet. Ideally I see this table being placed inside a printing studio/shop, although for people -like me- who own a metal (or wood!) font but not a press, or maybe own a font so valuable (to them) that they actually avoid using it for fear of wear, I think it can still house the font in a way that maintains dignity. Again, it depends on the customer: he can choose to see/show the font as a freak, or as a living tool.
2) I decided not to include a case or type with the table (although like I've said I can help the customer locate either or both).

Do you use real old material for your designs sometimes?
A guy from the Netherlands bought one of my collages with the name "A 'p' is not a 'q'". He built a table out of it:

It was built with a little more space between the glass and the type drawer because of the style of type drawer I have (it has a 1/4" lip along the front edge). I don't really have enough metal or wood type to fill it yet. That'll be my next project. Maybe I'll fill it with Legos or USB flash drives in the mean time. :-)
