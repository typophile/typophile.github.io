body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI want to do something to give back to my hometown, so i've come
  up with an idea for a pasty cook off. This would be an interface to strengthen and
  further bond Marquette, Michigan. Through pasties I hope to strengthen, facilitate
  and connect the community, as well as stimulate the local businesses.\r\n\r\nThe
  National Pasty Cookoff\r\n2010 Marquette, Michigan\r\n  \r\nI want to make a website
  and a poster series to begin the promotional process.\r\n\r\nI am breaking a few
  \"type rules\" using too many typefaces, but I want this to have a retro/vintage
  feel.\r\nAny feedback about typography or ideation for the event itself would be
  greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDerrick\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

  body: "UP Pasties! Haven't those in years. \r\n\r\nI like where these are going.
    I agree with both etahchen and riccard0...the 'cook off' seems subdued compared
    to the rest of the poster. I think it needs to be emphasized more. "

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nI've tried what you guys are saying..\r\nI
    could even go into Cinema 4D for the rosette.. If you think it would be necessary.
    \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nI couldn't get them to upload to this post,
    so I've just added the images to the original post.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: With "more 3D" I meant mainly in order to link it more with the 3D effect
    of the PASTY shadowed text.

  body: Sweet! Love the UP! Maybe use numerals for the year as opposed to writing
    it out. That is if the year is supposed to be somewhat useful to know/read. Other
    then that (and yes, make Pasty Cook-off more pronounced) I like the feel of these.
