  a few minutes ago, and had to give up because one the the frequent poster has an
  animated icon under his/her name. Interestingly it was a thread about art vs. design.
  The Art side may say he is entitled to use animation, but the design side says doing
  such a thing makes it impossible to read threads where he has posted. The animation
  is continually pulling my eyes away from the thread, ten times a second (or so).\r\n\r\nWhat
  do others think?"

      banned around here; when used with restraint, as in Nick Shinn's avatar, animation

    Chris. I've considered making all the 60x60px Typophile user icons into a giant
    mosaic/quilt style graphic. Wouldn't that be nice? It could make a rather pleasing,
    if somewhat noisy, desktop wallpaper.\r\n\r\nThe non-conformist regulars would
