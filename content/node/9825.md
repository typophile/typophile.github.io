  high-quality custom work. And even then, you can never catch the Concorde. So, in

  body: 'Hrant! <BR>I must admit, I did my research on font publisher&#39;s payments
    a few years ago when I was submitting designs. &#40;I was only successfull once
    - selling Eastwood to ITC: <A HREF="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=1X7VX1BE6C8S9KPC544DAL9CEE500439&amp;sku=ITC2126"

    &#40;If anyone wants to know the story of the font, how long it took to make and
    how much money it has made so far then by all means email me.&#41; <BR>Perhaps
    I had, by then, learnt to attune my design submissions to ITC&#39;s sensibilities.
    But also, by that time I was tired of my work falling on deaf ears - so to speak
    - and I gave up.  <BR>If I could come out with a new font once a month then $2500
    or $2000 might be attractive. We all know though that this work rate is unrealistic.  <BR>Also,
    like every other type designer who ever lived I was self-taught and had to learn
    everything the hard way, including the commercial side of the profession. Unfortunately
    I found that all too often, other type designers were simply coy about the commercial
    aspect of their work and would never get into conversations on the nitty gritty
    details about how much they were paid for particular fonts and how long the work
    took. This secrecy seems to continue today, and it remains a mystery to me how
    online font publishers such as Chank, Larabie et al make enough money to justify
    the work. I&#39;m quite certain that font design is subsidized by the other professional
    work such graphic designers do, and is not really a viable economic concern in
    and of itself. <BR>Sorry that the discussion has gone off topic. I&#39;m new to
    this forum and just took the opportunity to bring up this subject.'

    sources which subsidizes the labor of love that is type design.  <BR>The number
    of type designers in the world that make enough money to call it their sole profession
    &#40;that&#39;s not the best definition, but hopefully you understand what I mean&#41;
    is probably less than twenty. &#40;And if we put our heads together we could probably
    come up with a list of exactly who those people are.&#41;  <BR>I would be willing
    to bet that they can only say that because they are the sort of elite graphic
    designer who gets commisioned for a new font for a magazine or newspaper - NOT
    because they make so much money on retail sales of their fonts. <BR>&#40;By the

    in assuming that: <BR> <BR>1. The List contains those who make &#42;most&#42;
    of their living from their own type designs &#40;not lettering, not anything else&#41;,
    be it custom or retail. &#40;I think we can all agree that virtually nobody can

    so, Black and Spiekermann I don&#39;t think are on there. Zapf is hard to tell
    these days. Licko is probably that side of the border &#40;she was commissioned
    -using the term somewhat loosely- for Journal, I think&#41;. Shinn is unlikely
    &#40;as much as I like his stuff&#41;. Unger is a strong contender &#40;but note
    that he teaches&#41;. Tankard definitely. Quay I don&#39;t think. Also, Miles
    Newlyn might be a possibility, but I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s up to lately.
    And Tobias Frere-Jones is probably in there. David Berlow might be, if he doesn&#39;t
    make too much money outside his own type designs. And don&#39;t forget the Dutch
    Twins &#40;even though they bend the definition of &#34;type&#34; - good for them&#41;.

    too. So there&#39;s a tentative yes. <BR>Zapf at, what is it, 85 could still walk
    into most any big corporation and they&#39;d hire him as a  consultant. But I
    think I agree that perhaps he isn&#39;t that active compared to the younger professionals

    Tankard should be on the list. I think his case needs to be made.  <BR>The Dutch
    twins I think shouldn&#39;t be there as they most probably make a fortune as the
    hottest graphic designers over there, doing stuff for tv etc. I&#39;m sure their
    font design work doesn&#39;t earn that much. <BR>Unger and Carter are automatically
    on the list.  <BR>Porchez is probably the Jonathan Hoefler of France. <BR>Roger

    As for the &#34;corporation&#34; aspect you bring up, that&#39;s definitely something
    to consider, but only case-by-case. I have to agree with Martin, and restate that
    -to me at least- the most useful question to &#91;try to&#93; answer here is:
    who makes most of their living from sales of their own designs? In the case of
    FB, it&#39;s difficult to say who gets how much of what &#40;I&#39;m sure some
    of you know, though&#41;; in the case of Emigre, it&#39;s clearer &#40;see below&#41;;
    and in the case of HTF, although it&#39;s getting less clear, it&#39;s still relatively
    very clear: Hoefler&#39;s library is mostly his - he&#39;s the one who worked
    on  the bulk of the designs, and he&#39;s the one who gets most of the cash. TFJ
    is his partner now &#40;but an equal partner?&#41;, so that makes it trickier,
    but I don&#39;t think HTF is really a &#34;font house&#34;, so I suspect TFJ gets
    most of the money from his own designs. Insiders please correct me if I&#39;m
    wrong. <BR> <BR>Joe: <BR>In the case of Emigre, I have to ask: fonts designed
    by &#42;whom&#42;? In the past three years Licko has designed one new font family.
    And surely RvL doesn&#39;t live off of Suburban... Like most font houses, Emigre
    gives between 10-20% royalties to its designers, and the rest could be enough
    to make a living &#40;although less and less with each passing day&#41;, but to
    me that&#39;s really beside the point: we&#39;re talking about investing time
    designing type, not leveraging a powerful brand to profit from the design work
    of others, as smart as that is &#40;or at least used to be&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '
