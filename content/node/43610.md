  for one for a long time. I will put you on my next Christmas list.

    4 threads about this in the last while.

  body: Try <a href="http://weheartit.com/">We heart it</a>. Just launched. Same concept
    as Ffffound but arguably a more functional design, plus tags and comments. Here's
    <a href="http://weheartit.com/user/stewf">my page</a>.

    of ffffound is that there is only images. No tagclouds, pages of comments and
    other things that distract from the content.\r\n\r\nBut I'll take a loot at We
    heart it. :)"

    it typohile comes up as a top hit so people figure it''s a good place to go. But
    if people actually read the threads they''d realize we don''t have them.'

  body: Sorry! You can delete my thread if you want. I found an invite :) I basically
    had to ask everyone on the internet so good luck to you sir. Every member only
    gets one invite thats why they're so hard to find.

  body: "And ffffound is awesome because it doesn't have all those tags and comments
    and adding friends and listing your interests. It's anti social networking and
    that's totally fine with me.\r\n\r\nNothing ruins a good piece of design like
    some moron talking about how much he hates President Bush or PrincessGal69 inviting
    me to play online poker. "

    except the comments and tags, and they are not intrusive.

  body: "I find the mouseovers annoying. I want large previews where I don't have
    to click to see the whole image. \r\nDon't get me wrong, I love tags. Pretty much
    the best things ever.\r\nBut ffffound kinda does that automatically by sourcing
    words from the website the picture was saved from to give you suggestions of similar
    images. We heart it relies on user input and I notice a lot of the images don't
    have tags anyway. And I never ever thought I'd be saying this. But there's too
    much pink.\r\n\r\nFfffounds not perfect but I think i prefer it."

    of the word? If it doesn't I won't join.

    to end up with a lot of invites to buy generic diet pills instead. Convenient!\r\n\r\nAndi\r\n\r\n[<a
