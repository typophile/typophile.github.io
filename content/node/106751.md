    by [[http://www.benjamincritton.com|Benjamin Critton]] for Sight Unseen Paper
    View (designed by [[http://studiolin.org/clients/sight_unseen|(Studio) Andrew

    App]]. Some more could be found [[http://bullettmedia.com/valentines-day-gift-guide-2013|here]]
    as well. After a closer inspection, that looks very close to [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/raisonne/demibold|Colophon
    Raisonn\xE9]]. So may be a custom version of it, exclusive for Bullett Media.\r\nMore

  body: "Agree. My first thought was \"Ten Dollar Fonts\" but finally, none was matching.
    I ended up with Colophon. Raisonn\xE9 is definitely matching the basic alphabet.
    Some letters would have been customized..."
