  know it have been manipulated, especially the two A.\r\nBut if you know the font
  you can still see what it is.\r\nIt\xB4s common in the artworld. \r\nIt has that
  special R, which unfortunetly also is manipulated in the logo,it use to be a gap
  at the left side of the sharp edge of the R, if you know what I meen.  \r\nI appreciate
  your help.."
