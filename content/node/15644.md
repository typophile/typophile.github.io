  body: "I would rather classify that as a Textura/Gothic, not a Fraktur (quadratic
    'serifs', form of sc 'o', '\xF6', 'r'). I think I have seen this logo in an ad
    in a telephone book of Vienna 1924, so it is probably hard to find their 'font'
    (if it is not custom, which I could imagine, sure based on letterforms). Their
    <a href=http://www.boesendorfer.com>website</a> does not give any hints on the
    logo or since when it is in use. Perhaps they can help you if you ask politely?"
