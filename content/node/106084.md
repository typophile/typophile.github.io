  body: Create a line the desired thickness for the shadow effect > rotate the line
    to the desired angle  for the shadow > create a pattern from/with that line >
    duplicate the text layer move the layer under the original text layer and create
    outline of the text > fill the outlined text with the line pattern > off set the
    pattern from the text > and as in your above example stroke the original text.

  body: 5star, it's a little more complicated than that because the line pattern is
    part of a 3d extrusion of the text, not a drop shadow of the text. To make that
    shape you'd need to make two copies of the letter and manually connect the points
    on one to the equivalent points on the other to create the diagonal extrusion.

    the example as a flat shadow with a line pattern.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/TYPOHILE_T_lineshadow.jpg\">\r\n\r\nMust

    Josh. I'm not say it can't be done as you say but take a closer look at the diagonal
    lines in the Op's sample. There are several different sections each having the
    diagonal lines on different angles. Can that be accomplished by 3d extrusion of
    the text, perhaps I'll try it later. But, I think it was hand rendered via guides
    and all ...and not extruded.\r\n\r\nIn my below sample I overlayed text and traced
    the areas I wanted to fill as I mentioned earlier. All the diagonal lines are
    evenly spaced and of the same angle because it is a pattern, but the shadow effect
    seems to get lost especially on the crossbar of the G...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/typophile_crosshatch.jpg\">\r\n\r\n...one
    way or another I'll have mastered this crosshatching technique by the end of this
    weekend ...GRRR!!!"
