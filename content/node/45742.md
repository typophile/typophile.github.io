body: A long time ago somebody did an interesting experiment with a website where
  any number of people could go in and draw pixels in a bitmap, and the resultant
  collaborative rendering (not to mention the journey) was very interesting. I did
  some searching on Typophile but couldn't find it. Help? Thanks.

    I forget where it lives.

    and [[http://typographica.org/000317.php|this]]. Unfortunately most links lead
    nowhere. From what I understand it was a project done by [[http://kevan.org/|Kevan

    there was even a dead link to it until until fairly recently on the Typophile
    Projects page. Hopefully there's a backup somewhere.

  body: I agree that it's deeply interesting for the reason you say. But "valuable"
    goes beyond that ( as I am thinking about it anyway ) and suggests that there
    is information useful to the designer of type. That I am less sure about. I have
    several reasons for that. The most important of which is that what people think
    is right and what they in fact will respond to best when it comes down to it are
    not quite the same thing. They might be related, but you would have to show me
    that in some kind of testing before I would accept it. Also, people are typographically
    naive as a group when it comes to creating visual stuff and maybe especially type.
    ( I have no beef with them as consumers of type ). You could say that it is elitist
    and undemocratic to toss out the ideas of a group of people but I don't think
    that stands scrutiny as a practical matter. What I do think is interesting is
    where people spent the most time in disagreement like about the crossbar on the
    top of the J. It shows that a part of the population is uneasy with the bar. But
    in general I think to make very much hay from this you might have to do it again
    at a larger size. There is also the question of the UI. I found it cumbersome.
    That had to have an impact as well. Do you disagree?

  body: "Good point Si. \r\n\r\nI think when people are asked to draw letters they
    often draw sans serifed ones. I can't recal where I read that though.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the shape the letter is seemingly \"meant\" to occupy is identical in each of
    the letter & number examples. That seems to have made a big impact too. Would
    everybody have made an M with the name width as N given other prompts? "
