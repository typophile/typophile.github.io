  \r\n\r\nHere is the problem:\r\n\r\nI'm doing a website for a client (photographer).\r\n\r\nLogo
  for client is in Engravers gothic (similar to the Marc Jacobs logo) - it has a fairly
  strong presence on the page. The overall look for the site is clean and elegant.
  Lots of white space with some image-heavy sections.\r\n\r\nSo I need to lay out
  the navigation and text for the site - but I'm having a hard time figuring out what
  typeface will work on the page with the strong presence of Engravers Gothic. This
  is an impossible typefact to work around!\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a suggestion for
  navigation and body copy text that won't clash with the somewhat extended look of
  the Engravers font - without actually setting the nav items and copy in an extended
  typeface? (I think a whole paragraph in an extended face - or all set in Engravers
  (which is all caps) would look awful.)\r\n\r\nI'm not adverse to using serif - just
  think a san serif look on the web is cleaner and more readable.\r\n\r\nI mean, can
  I use Helvetica? Will something like Helvetica completely wreck the elegance of
  Engravers Gothic?\r\n\r\nI'm confounded.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    can do no harm

  body: I would avoid the serif. They just don't work well on the web. Helvetica is
    also better in print than on the web, IMO. You could test with both Verdana and
    Trebuchet to see which of these designed for the web fonts work best. Manlio is
    correct in that you are limited in options ... many people will not have Helvetica
    on their system, and might get Times as a default on an HTML page. The two fonts
    I mention are options not for their beauty, but because they are on pretty much
    everyone's system.

  body: "sorry I should have mentioned - it's a Flash site. \r\n\r\nWhen I go to sites
    that use Engravers Gothic type fonts in their logos (ie: Aqua di Parma, Marc Jacobs)
    I notice they use the same font (EG) in their nav items as well. I'm hoping to
    avoid that all-caps look.\r\n\r\nSince it's a Flash I can use anything. Eventually
    I'll probably do new letterhead, business cards, etc. for the client so I'm hoping
    to find something that works well with Engravers in print as well. But finding
    a san serif that works well with this logo on the web is a first priority.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    I'd be interested to know if it helps assess fonts for the purposes mentioned.
    (And I have a face that may work for you.)

  body: I WOULD USE ANY CONTRASTING SHAPED SERIF FONT THAT READS WELL. Engravers Gothic
    is a thing of the past when steel die engraving was a matter of elegance and later
    tried to be imitated in the letterrpress printing process. Also reversing type
    out of a dark background is the anthesis of legibility. Most offensive is blue
    reversing out of a black background.

    with a very classy and old-fashioned look (like the invitation cards you see in
    the middle of the 1943 Powell & Pressburger film \u201CThe life and death of Colonel
    Blimp\u201D). This might not be what your client is after, though.  \r\n"

    have to say, although I think they did it well, I'm not loving the Engravers at
    all. I think it somehow looks 'forced' on screen. The all caps I find hard to
    read - or at least not easy on the eyes. It's definitely a look. Thanks sihep
    for pointing that site out. It's great to see it in use. And it confirmed all
    my suspicions - I'll probably go back to the drawing board. "
