  body: Evidently, you don't work in Windows (or didn't bother to look in your own
    font folder, if you do)...the typeface is <strong>Jokerman</strong>, which comes
    with Word, if not with the OS itself.

  body: "From the Emigre site:\r\n\r\n<cite>In 1988 the London-based Thunderjockeys,
    consisting of Graham Elliott and John England, designed an album cover for the
    New York metal band Living Colour. The logo they drew for this cover was either
    the inspiration for a number of such curlicue typefaces surfacing in those days,
    or was simply a harbinger of these creations destined to come out due to that
    period's interest in 60's and 70's styles.</cite>\r\n\r\nRemedy was designed in
    1991; Jokerman, in 1995. I think the sample is Jokerman due to the holes in the
    'a' (a-holes?).\r\n\r\n - Lex"
