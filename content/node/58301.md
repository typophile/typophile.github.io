  to be available on standard windows (vista) computers.\r\n\r\nThe conference logo
  uses Interstate Light. Any suggestions for a windows sans serif (or even serif)
  that would pair well with Interstate Light? I currently selected Franklin Gothic
  bc it just looks better than Arial or Verdana...thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    It's not.\r\n\r\n>Calibri is nice.\r\n\r\nI second that, but in a combo with Interstate?
    Perhaps Cambria would work better, also being nice but something entirely different."
