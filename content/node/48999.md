  and was wondering if anyone knows of a free font that has the same wooden block
  effect but is all black. Thats my problem. It has white lined through it as is is
  called 'woodgrain'.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\n\r\n"

  body: or, if it's the wood grain that you actually like, couldn't you create outlines
    of the type so that the 'grain' doesn't show as white lines?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodgrain_4270.jpg]
