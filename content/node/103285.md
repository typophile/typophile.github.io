    Tiponautas themselves if this is an old or a new version of Tramuntana."

  body: "Hello guys,\r\nWe just caught your post by coincidence. That's a new (and
    unreleased) version of Tramuntana. Ricardo Santos is the designer of Tramuntana
    and he decided to use this new version for that specific poster and some other
    design elements related to the event. \r\nWe are going to release this new version
    shortly so stay tuned. You guys really have eagle eyes!"
