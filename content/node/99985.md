body: "My new typeface, \"Columbia Titling\", is now on sale at MyFonts and for a
  limited time is just $8 for four weights!\r\n\r\nColumbia Titling is an titling-caps
  display family based on wide Clarendon-style wood type and industrial signage design
  from the late-19th and early-20th Century. It includes a small set of OpenType features,
  including both tabular and proportional figures, special superscript ordinal suffixes,
  underlined superscript alternate letters, and OpenType fractions. The typeface takes
  its name from the historic S.S. Columbia, a steamboat launched in 1903. Though not
  a true reproduction, the wide, slab serif letterforms on the front of the Columbia's
  wheelhouse provided some inspiration for to develop this typeface. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/columbia-titling/"

      very specific purposes (ordinal suffixes, surname prefixes \u2014 e.g. Mc-,
      Mac-, Di- \u2014 etc.). In making them lowercase I thought I might be unintentionally
      inviting their use as a full lowercase, which I didn't intend."

  body: "Yes.\r\nI\u2019m not sure I did the right thing in Parity, a unicase typeface,
    by making the lower case an optically scaled version of the upper case. Certainly,
    it provides value for money, but when the face shows at distributor sites in their
    default U&lc setting as \u201CUnicase with Small Unicase\u201D it looks like a
    silly novelty, and not at all the way it\u2019s intended to be used."

  body: "Right \u2014 that was my thinking. I occasionally wonder if I did the right
    thing since not all programs can access those OpenType superior features, but
    since they're to be used sparingly anyway I think I'm okay with it.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way Parity is a gorgeous typeface!"

    in the ones that can, they are buried beneath several clicks, drags and/or popup
    menus.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in InDesign, for instance, when the user goes digging,
    the \uFB01rst \u201CSupescript\u201D is faux, and the OpenType real deal is a
    level deeper. Aaaagh!\r\n\r\nAlternates are actually more easily accessible as
    separate fonts, because the font \uFB01eld is clearly on view in the top level
    of all layout applications.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve been making

  body: Don't stop now, Nick. Eventually, users will become more savvy, and applications
    will get better. If all type designers go back to making separate fonts for small
    caps and all the rest of it, the people who make the layout applications won't
    bother making them work better. It's annoying that not all end users use fonts
    to their full potential, but doesn't it make it that bit nicer when you see that
    somebody has done?

    have been asking myself for years: the user popping down the typeface menu, the
    user popping down the OT menu, what makes the difference?? But for me as the designer/producer,
    it makes a great difference wether I put an alternative set in a seperate font
    \u2013 or to labour additionally upon OT implementation. (which is not an equally
    appropriate concern for all of the alternatives possible, of course). Does this
    extra-work ever pay-off?\r\n\r\nSorry for going off-topic.\r\nCongratulations
    to the typeface, very nice!"

  body: "Thanks for the comments, everyone!\r\n\r\nIn regards to pricing, Nick is
    correct \u2014 bargain sale prices are essentially a form of advertising. Plus,
    if there's the possibility of selling more typefaces at a lower price, the revenue
    stream stays the same \u2014 i.e. selling 20 licenses for $8 versus selling 4
    licenses for $40. In a field growing as quickly as type design, it's good for
    a young foundry that might otherwise struggle to get noticed.\r\n\r\nAnd this
    idea is nothing new \u2014 several foundries post their fonts for 50, 75, even
    90% off on first release for this reason."

  body: "<em>Does this extra-work ever pay-off?</em>\r\n\r\nAs a designer/foundry,
    one does develop a clientele of repeat customers attuned to one\u2019s work.\r\nHopefully
    they study the PDF (and occasional printed) specimens we provide, and become familiar
    with the sophistication of the OpenType features at their disposal, and why we
    put them in the fonts.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly relevant for \uFB01gures.\r\nYou
    can\u2019t do \uFB01ne typography without discriminating between the many different
    styles of \uFB01gure available in an OpenType font, and it would be absurd to
    put these all in different fonts.\r\n\r\nThe question is, are those discriminating
    typographers my potential customers?\r\nI\u2019d like to think so!\r\n"
