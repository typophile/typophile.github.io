  a (very) quick search and didn\u2019t find anything relevant.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve long
  been a big fan of fonts and typography. But lately I\u2019m interested in learning
  more about it. And more specifically type design. So I\u2019ve been reading and
  looking all over the internet for more info. But I\u2019m getting a bit lost in
  here. So. To have a better understanding of what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m
  now interested in buying a good book on the basics of type design. Oh and it would
  also be good if it doesn\u2019t only contains the basics, and goes even further
  on the more advanced stuff.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nLeo\r\n\r\nPS: Any must-read
  internet links on the subject (for beginners) are always appreciated."

    those links look very useful too. I didn\u2019t even found the 'How To\u2019-section
    on this yet, this will come in handy, I think.\r\nThank you very much both of
    you. :)"

    Karen Cheng: designing type. I found it really helpfull :)\r\nLet me know if you
    find some other good stuff out there!\r\n"

    find James Puckett's list pretty interesting too, not that I've read everything

    and <em>Letters of Credit</em>, both on said list, are definitely helpful for
    beginning typeface designers. Also, I understand that Hyphen Press is working
    on <a href=\"http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-42-8\">an updated
    edition of <em>Counterpunch</em></a>."
