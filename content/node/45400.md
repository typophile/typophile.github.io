    of a superfamily that\u2019s of next to no use on its own. But Veer definitely
    does promos better."

    USES the font, I'm saying OWNS the font. It comes on every package of fonts ever
    created. \r\n\r\nAnd it has approximately 3 uses."

  body: I'm not sure what all three uses of University Roman are. I know one is definitely
    Ice Cream Shoppe signage (it's gotta have the "pe" on the end), but what are the
    other two? Community Theatre Winter Concert program? Tim machine operator's manual?
    What else?

  body: University Roman was used for all the bronze monument signs at the gateways
    of the gated communities in Roseville, CA, until some were stolen for scrap value
    and the rest were removed to preclude their being stolen for scrap value.

    found the alphabet in a speedball lettering book and made a light and bold version
    for photolettering.

    the Flash Dance leg warmers.... only the original ones  ;)"

    yet sadly, after a quick check of spotlight, it's on my hard drive (not installed
