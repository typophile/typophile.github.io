  body: It looks like something between the "lowercases" of Engravers Roman (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-roman/)

  body: "Closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers|Sackers Roman]]
    Heavy but that's not it... Searching...\r\n\r\nEDIT: better sample [[http://shopcoatbridge.com/library/img/home_wordmark.png|here]].

    tend to see the former top shape of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers/std-heavy-roman/glyphs.html#glyphs/542657/51|Sackers
    Roman's one]]..."
