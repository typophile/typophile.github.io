body: "I've been working on some code and developed a liga feature that creates [fb
  fh fi figrave fj fk fl] ligatures by replacing the base form of f with a shortened-hood
  variant. I gather that for Mac compatibility I also need to include fi and fl ligatures
  as single glyphs.\r\n\r\nThere's also very narrow f alternates for next to the idieresis
  and icircumflex.\r\n\r\nI have also developed some code that applies to [ff ffb
  ffh ffi ffigrave ffj ffk and ffl] or any number of fs preceding these letters. It
  replaces the initial f with a slightly lower-hooded variant (and any following ones
  that are followed by another f) and the final f by the shorter version. That way
  I don't need to create new glyphs for all these combinations and for the [fff] variants.\r\n\r\nHere's
  the code:\r\n\r\n<code>feature liga {\r\n<code>\u2003\u2003sub f'f by f.low;   \r\n<code>\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003#lowers
  the hood of any fs except last in chain\r\n<code>\u2003\u2003sub f' [b h i igrave
  j k l] by f.medium;   \r\n<code>\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003#shortens the hood of normal
  height f \r\n<code>\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003#which is last in chain\r\n<code>\u2003\u2003sub
  f' icircumflex by f.short;\r\n<code>\u2003\u2003sub f' idieresis by f.shortest;\r\n<code>\u2003\u2003sub
  T' h' by Th;\r\n<code>} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nQuestion is can anyone see any problems
  with doing things this way? And is there any way to neaten up the code further?
  I'm not a programmer but it works."

    it's not a ligature, more of a contextual alternate, but so what.\r\nSome foundries
    make these extra ligatures discretionary (dlig), but IMO liga is best, on by dfault.\r\nYou
    can neaten up the code by putting glyphs in brackets into a class -- this may
    help you manage kerning situations with capitals such as T.\r\n\r\n<em>sub T'
    h' by Th;</em>\r\n\r\nThat's an Adobe trope."

  body: "In Mac applications that use the native system font rendering (through ATSUI
    or CoreText) on Mac OS X 10.4, contextual alternate features don't work. In 10.5
    and 10.6, they \"sort of\" work but more complex contextual substitutions perform
    incorrectly. But a simple one like yours should work. \r\n\r\nI propose a better
    solution: \r\n\r\n<code>feature liga {\r\n  lookup liga_contextual { \r\n\u2003\u2003sub
    f' f by f.low;\r\n\u2003\u2003sub f' [b h i igrave j k l] by f.medium;\r\n\u2003\u2003sub
    f' icircumflex by f.short;\r\n\u2003\u2003sub f' idieresis by f.shortest;\r\n
    \ } liga_contextual; \r\n  lookup liga_Th { \r\n\u2003\u2003sub T h by T_h;\r\n
    \ } liga_Th;\r\n  lookup liga_fifl { \r\n  sub f i by f_i;\r\n  sub f l by f_l;\r\n
    \ } liga_fifl;\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nThe first lookup will work whenever contextual
    substitutions are supported (so it won't work in Mac OS X 10.4 or some other environments
    where contextual OTL rules are not processed). \r\nThe second lookup will always
    work because it's a simple substitution. \r\nThe third lookup will only be activated
    if the first lookup did not get processed, so it'll work in Mac OS X 10.4, or
    in situations when contextual substitutions don't work for some reason. If the
    first lookup worked, the third will be omitted (because the \"f\" glyph has been
    replaced by \"f.medium\" by the time the third lookup gets processed, so the third
    lookup won't have any input to process). \r\n\r\n"

    yes?\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out the T kerning situation. I think the glyphs
    in the brackets are ok but the idieresis/icircumflex and itilde will need some
    attention.\r\n\r\nAdam, thanks for the info about Mac systems, I don't know any
    of that kind of stuff so it's very helpful."
