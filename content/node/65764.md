body: "I've been working on a personal New Years card, but seem to be stuck.\r\nI
  started with a simple grid (which explains the bad kerning ;-)) & did some custom
  type & patterns. I'm quite happy with all the seperate elements, but have no idea
  what to do with them.\r\nI like the custom type I did for 'the new year' but I obviously
  can't use it as it is 'cause it wouldn't make much sense on its own. I tried to
  spell 'Best wishes for the new year' but couldn't make it all look good together.\r\nSince
  I liked the flipped 'Best wishes' I figured I could translate an ambigram I did
  of my name once to the same grid as a signature (so everything could be read upside
  down as well) but it seems unbalanced.\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated
  since I can feel the deadline breathing down my neck ;-)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NY_6561.gif]"

  body: "I'm finding it hard to read, especially with the way you have the shape laid
    out behind \"Best Wishes.\" I find because there's some whitespace in the middle
    of the W that I want to break the word there, and then again where the other breaks
    in the background are. I think you could use the background fill shape to help
    make the words more legible, by adding space in the background between the letters
    and keeping the background solid beneath the words. This could also work vertically
    on \"the New Year.\" I think giving a bit more leading to the words there would
    help increase legibility.\r\n\r\nI understand the desire to make an ambigram work,
    but in this case, with the already tough to read lettering, I think an ambigram
    just adds a whole lot more confusion to the mix.\r\n\r\nI do like the type you've
    created, and I really like the backgrounds you've got going as well. I just think
    overall it's becoming a bit busy and confusing and working on stuff to help organize
    things, like the solid background shape, would help.\r\n\r\nHuh. Looking at the
    date on this, I'm thinking there's a chance you've already completed the project,
    but I thought I'd post my replay anyways."

    a white background with the upper pattern on the back of the card. Nothing more,
    nothing less."

  body: "I always recall something a photography teacher used to say, paraphrased:\r\n\r\n\"Composition
    is largely a value problem\"\r\n\r\nAnd by value he meant the range of darks to
    lights. Your main issue here is that your background is so distracting, it's a
    heavily contrasted background that uses the same shapes, space, and value as the
    type; sure eliminating the background completely will also work but there's other
    approaches:\r\n\r\n- Redo the background color palette to use colors of closer
    value\r\n- Enlarge the type\r\n- Reduce the size of the background so that it
    appears as a tighter pattern\r\n- Increase the stroke on the type and/or decrease
    the stroke on the background"
