  web tools I found similarities to handwritten felt-tip fonts, though I can't find
  the exact font.\r\n\r\nFont was originally used in Gimp image editor, probably in
  a Ubuntu Linux machine, so I think it might be a free font provided with old versions
  of ubuntu (it does not appear in the latest versions).\r\n\r\nI attach the sample
  I have.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "Well, I made a determined effort to locate this: I searched all Handwritten
    fonts at MyFonts, I searched two categories from my Script Font ID Guide, and
    I searched Dafonts Handwritten fonts. I could not find an identical match. \r\n\r\nClose-but-no-cigars
    were: MVB Calliope, Sweet Pea, Caliban, About Face and With Ink (all at MyFonts.
    You'll have to pardon my failure to add links for them.)\r\n\r\nI think your sample
    shows some professionalism in the way the letters are formed and kerned, so I
    believe it is a font, but I cannot find it (yet), and I don't know if further
    searching is justified. Hand printed lettering is just too common.\r\n\r\n- Mike
