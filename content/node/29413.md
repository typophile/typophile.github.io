body: "Hi Typophiles, \r\nI\u2019m designing a logo for a flooring company. This is
  a starting business, very small for now. He has a license with the name \u201CImperial
  Flooring Solutions.\u201D I notice there were other companies named similar so we
  came up with the \u201Csolutions\u201D before he got the license. He was really
  sticking to the name because of a family tradition on a different kind of business.\r\nIn
  doing my research I notice almost every flooring company uses either floor tiles
  or carpets on their logo so that was one thing we wanted to stay away from. Another
  thing I noticed is that companies named \u201CImperial\u201D in other fields always
  use either shields with lions or crowns (for obvious reasons) so that was something
  we wanted to stay away from.\r\n\r\nServices: Laminated Floor, Vinyl, Carpet and
  installation of all these. No hardwood at all. Commercial meaning no small houses
  but big buildings. Big projects.\r\n\r\nAfter this brief background research I came
  up with some adjectives with my client.\r\n\u2022 Direct (client focus in direct
  contract)\r\n\u2022 Friendly (Client focus on consulting, advising client for best
  solution)\r\n\u2022 Empowering (to give a sense of confidence to the client)\r\n\u2022
  Growth (self explanatory)\r\n\u2022 Dominating (Imperial, Empire, dominion over
  areas)\r\n\r\nI came up with a set of concepts of which I selected four to explore.
  I\u2019ve been sketching forever and vectorized another whole bunch but still feel
  some of them need help. As far as the type, its just my first draft combining icon
  with type so I haven\u2019t locked up on any solution yet my only strong suggestion
  would be a slab serif for its rigidness compared to floors and buildings. He tends
  to like sans serif but serif seems to fit more for a trustable company especially
  in flooring business but again not locked up into it. \r\n\r\nAny type suggestions
  are more than welcome as I\u2019ve been having a hard time matching a typeface with
  each logo\u2019s look, e.g. hard edges w/slab pointy edges w/serif etc.\r\n\r\n1)
  Concept one takes on the consulting part as well as relating a pyramid with empire.
  The horizontal divisions represent floors in a building. The pyramid is formed by
  a number of arrows coming to an end point, meaning different solutions guided to
  the best.\r\n\r\n2) Concept two takes on the guidance part so like dancing lessons
  where they show foot steps to follow this idea leads to a center point. This on
  has been really hard to convey, it was selected only because I wanted at least three
  different directions. I thought the idea was clever but looks related to a shoe
  company.\r\n\r\n3) Concept three takes on the word Empire or Imperial, overtaking
  territory. It\u2019s a globe getting covered by floor titles and it highlights an
  \u201Ci\u201D. Legibility on this icon has been difficult.\r\n\r\n4) Concept four
  relates to the first one. This one combines Growth (as in a tree shape/arrow pointing
  up), Different directions (branches of the tree/arrows), and again the imperial
  pyramid/triangle shape. I started wit a geometric shape but then decided to try
  a hand made one to give it some human touch (friendly).\r\n\r\nI want to present
  all four or at least three so let me know what you think/suggest specially type
  suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/IFS_variations_v1_5735.0.jpg]"

  body: "Just my two cents:\r\n\r\n#1 is your best option to explore further. I agree
    that the im ligature is very awkward. I would suggest a slab serif font for \"imperial\"
    and maybe a clean sans (frutiger, gotham, or helvetica) for the Flooring Solutions.
    I would say that the pyramid needs some refining. Right now I would think it would
    be a brick building industry, not flooring. \r\n\r\nWith the other three options,
    I just think your imagery is not clear. The abstract icon is not doing anything
    for the mark. \r\n\r\nHope this helps some."

    about Imperial taking over the world as a metaphor, not that they would but \u201CImperial\u201D

    The word Imperial has many connotations. It could be the British Empire, Roman

    to and work off of that.\r\n\r\nI did my research and showed that to the client,
    there\u2019s also some history in the Mexican flag and symbol that has to do with
    the Mexican Imperial (Imperio Mexicano) and the Mayan Imperium etc since he\u2019s
    Mexican, but again he doesn\u2019t want any kind of political connotations. It\u2019s
    a tricky one but I think a pyramid could be related to an empire in general, so
    does territory.\r\n\r\n> the im ligature is very awkward.\r\n\r\nAgree with it
    when I was doing it, I had to try it and will work on it or just erase it.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "I like your 2c concept although maybe not such an extreme perspective, I
    also wonder whether a pair (or more) of footprints might be better and going in
    more than one direction, I know I'm being literal, and it might prove difficult
    to realise at logo scale. \r\nQuick reactions to the others\r\nIt might just be
    me but I see option 3 as a bit British, hints of Union Jack. I like the idea of
    4 multi directions but the handrawn one looks like a falling tree wheras the others
    look like Christmas trees. 1b laughing sinister robot? 1c is better for me although
    I'm not sure your concept is clear in the icon.\r\nFor the type treatment 1 is
    my preference, with the same reservations about the im, the secondary line looks
    a bit small for some sizes though.\r\nTim"

  body: "Some thoughts on my ideas. Apparently haven't been successful at my attempts.
    \r\n\r\nThe client rejected any kind of clich\xE9 like using a carpet, a floor
    tile, a shield or a crown. So then I thought of the many logos I see every day
    and not many of them tell me right away what it is, its the icon or the color
    or the type treatment that lets me identify it as a brand. Then you may learn
    what the logo is trying to say. I never knew there was an arrow on the Fedex logo
    until I studied the brand.\r\nSome examples:\r\napple, bp, chase, cingular, city
    bank and one case study i just read on a logo created by Christopher Simmons for
    a company called \"Paradox Media\" were he took a very conceptual metaphor:\r\nhttp://www.gdusa.com/feature/4_03/paradox.jpg\r\n\r\n\"The
    classic Paradox. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This solution takes
    a multi layer approach, representing the world and conveying a sense of ongoing
    success. The enigmatic egg--the nascent talent--both confounds and compels the
    nurturing hen\" (words from his book \"Logo:Lab\")\r\n\r\nNot that this is the
    best logo in the world, but my point is that there's no techy graphics saying
    is a media company. I see a pyramid in a couple of my logos that represent an
    empire in a way and force. I see a world getting covered showing power again empire
    etc...\r\n\r\nDoes someone agree? \r\nby the way please I replaced the image and
    removed the first draft type treatments as they were done quickly just to get
    the idea.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nKco"

  body: ">not many of them tell me right away what it is\r\n\r\nI think that is why
    I liked the footprint option, especially the tilted version, after you have read
    the text it becomes clear that these are the tracks left by walking on the solutions*
    \u2013 the product is illustrated by its absence. The pyramid concept doesn't
    give me that revelation, it is a pyramid but I cannot link that with flooring
    so I am left wondering if the mark has a deeper meaning or no meaning, as Lex
    says the handrawn version appears to be a tree but the company doesn't do hardwood
    flooring so that also leaves me wondering. I think the world domination might
    be too ambitious a concept to represent in an icon while still remaining usable
    as a logo.\r\nYou are trying a literal approach to the logo which for my taste
    is better than ending up with a meaningless swoosh or pattern, on the other hand
    the nature of the product does lend itself to a pattern. I think the problem you
    are facing is that you are trying to include Imperial as well as flooring solution,
    as you say, you don't want to emphasise the Imperial part of the name maybe you
    should concentrate on what flooring solution means and leave the type to announce
    the Imperial part. I can't offer an answer but I do like the idea of showing something
    that isn't there.\r\nTim\r\n\r\n*a term btw which has become so hugely overused
    in the UK that its use parodied in a satirical magazine Private Eye"

    think it would be a brick building industry, not flooring.\r\n\r\nI tried removing
    some of the line interruptions to make it less brick looking, it still shows arrows,

    be a stack of tiles. \r\n\r\n#4 Is a direction that got discarded in the sketching
    process. It was a wordmark that replaced the \"A\" with two arrows pointing at

    no time to try new ideas.\r\n\r\nHope one of this works better. I still want to

  body: "I'm voting for the arrow tree. Nice an abstract, but still retains a bit
    of a literal vibe to it (the houseware industry, for better or worse, tends to
    use literal identities). (d'oh! Just read that the company doesn't do hardwood...as
    such, this mark doesn't work.)\r\n\r\nI like the footprint concept a lot, but
    I agree, it's going to be hard to pull off without it feeling like a dance studio
    or, perhaps worse, dirty floors. Perhaps a 'shoeless' foot print might work? Pitch
    the idea of 'floors so nice people go barefoot'? (and to echo my d'oh comment
    above, I think the footprints are actually more applicable to industrial/commercial
    flooring...so I think this mark has the most potential...perhaps play off the
    'commercial' aspect and really go overboard with the footprints...use a dozen
    or more of them to emphasis 'long wearing' or 'heavy traffic' or the like)\r\n\r\nThe
    pyramid is likely a 'safe' route to go. Doesn't carry much baggage. Nice and abstract.\r\n\r\nThe
    'mound', to me, looks like a warped floor. Probably a bad connotation.\r\n\r\nI
    like your last mark, but I see a TeePee more so than a Pyramid."
