Shouldn't the curve of "rounded" capital letters like "O" or "U" go pass the baseline just a little? I know that this is necessary in order for the rounded letter not to appear visually smaller than the others...it is a little hard to explain...I'm attaching a file...thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, overshoot is important to maintaining equal apparent size. <br> <br>But you could say that the main contemporary appeal of wood type is in fact in its "naive" nature, so... <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>i partly agree with you, but i think it is more of a matter of quality then...i guess that type in the olden days was produced by competent and incompetent people...just like today. I'm not talking about imperfections...</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you have several pieces of the actual wood type in your hands you will see that (at least in all the many fonts that I have had experience with) that there is no overshoot built into the font. If you are looking at 20 line type, you will see that letters like Z and H fill the body, with only about two point of beard for the angle created by the pantograph's cutter.; not nealry enough room to make an ideal overshoot of about 5 points for C, O, Q, etc. <br> <br>I think the woodtype makers considered it an unneccessary frill, or perhaps were just not that aware of typographical niceties. <br> <br>I think that as Hrant says, its naivety is its charm. <br> <br>If you take a close look at any Hamilton Woodtype book, it's almost a scandal, the rusticness of the letters' finish; but that is it charm. <br> <br>Jim Rimmer</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's worth pointing out here that the larger the type -and notably wood type's existence is tied to size- the less the [relative] overshoot needs to be. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>i honestly thought that it was more of a quality issue...because i have seen some wood type blocks that are really well constructed, and the overshoot seems to have been taken into consideration. <br> <br>for example, look at the "H" on the hamilton museum website home page <a href=http://www.woodtype.org target=_blank>http://www.woodtype.org</a> , you can tell that there is plenty of space on the bottom to accomodate an "O" or an "S" on the same size block... <br> <br>any suggetion on a book that may talk about this issue in detail? <br> <br>thanks <br> <br>so my original question was: if i want to reconstruct let's say a Akzidenz Grotesk, should i follow the overshoot principle or ignore it?</div>

<div class=commentbody>FYI, call the Hamilton Wood Museum. They still have wood type craftsmen that you can probably get a hold of to ask them this directly.</div>
