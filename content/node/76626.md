  body: "Right font, wrong cut. This is Berthold's \"Standard\" version vs. your sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/banodep_4136.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    \"difference\" in the a--as well as the overall weight and sharpness--can be attributed
    to ink gain, either on the press or from linecast repros. Unless your purpose
    is out-and-out forgery, I doubt that you'll get any closer with digital type."
