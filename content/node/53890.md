  assist in fixing our ecological problems? Any product that fills you with the hope
  that you are helping in some way with our environmental concerns. \r\n\r\nAnd as
  an aside, do you guys feel a responsibility as a designer to be fairly well educated
  in these smarter approaches to living?"

    and Cachet. Very nice.\r\n\r\nYes. A designer should be well educated in any job
    they take on, assuming that's why you're asking. If that's not why you're asking,
    I still say yes, but I'm not gonna grandstand about non-type issues here (although
    I believe most here would agree)."

  body: "I felt no pressure. For me, knowing about the stuff has to do with my lifestyle.
    I prefer a [insert clich\xE9 buzzword for environmentally-conscious living] lifestyle,
    so being knowledgeable about it is based more on my ethical stance than my trade.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, designers (can) have an influential voice and can use it to encourage 'smarter
    living,' as you say. If you have a practical way to use this graphic voice about
    any subject in which you are knowledgeable, design away!\r\n\r\nBy the way, <em>really</em>
    nice portfolio, Shari."

  body: "aw very kind of you, microspective. i'm continually working on the folio.
    \r\n\r\nBasically, I am looking for inspiration for a day-to-day, simple to use
    eco-product. I've been hired to name as well as brand it and thought if I had
    at least one really great name it would be easier to work on (instead of mockups
    of 3-5 ideas with 2 looks each \u2013 yikes! Feeling a little overwhelmed so I
    thought starting a side discussion would help diffuse the tension and stir some
    ideas. \r\n\r\n"
