  have advantage over the lefties. The orientation of hand and tool combined with
  the shape of letters and direction left-to-right is constitutive for the typical
  ductus of, e.g., Roman Capitals.\r\n\r\nThis is more of a teacher\u2019s consideration.
  I give courses on lettering and this means to encounter with left-handed students,
  naturally. I refrain from forcing them into something which is rather uncomfortable,
  so for quite some time I let them write all letters mirrored, from right to left,
  with the left hand. If they use a broad-nib edding the ink bleeds through the paper
  and at the end we just flip the sheet and see a normel left-to-right lettering;
  the results are as good as those from the righties, sometimes even better.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone of you similar considerations or experiences with lefthand formal lettering
  exercise? "

    with, when one just takes a short calligraphy workshop. \r\nIt has it's limits
    though. It only works for simple and more static letters. You can't do an end

    the methods seen on the right side remove all limitations for lefties. I saw some
    great examples of this technique on youtube some years ago, but unfortunately
    they were deleted. If I remember correctly, that guy, who created really stunning
    work, combined both methods. He used that special pen holder AND had the sheet
    turned 90 degrees. As a result, the position of the hand is actually pretty similar
    to regular left-handed writing. "

    of vertical east Asian scripts demonstrates is that there is sufficient vertical
    acuity for reading in that direction. Hrant may argue that it cannot be optimal,

  body: "Arbitrary rules? The typical modulation patterns of the signs of any script
    are not arbitrary: they're the evolved product of competence over time with particular
    tools. The fact that the majority of practitioners in any culture have been right
    handed is significant to the results, to be sure, but the very variety of modulation
    patterns in the world's writing systems indicates that it is not determinative
    of a singular pattern. But that doesn't mean that the evolved patterns of individual
    scripts are not important in terms of <em>reading</em>. Remember, what we're talking
    about is a combination of shapes and modulation, and different combinations of
    shape and modulation produce different spatial frequencies. Writing systems, as
    some of Pelli's studies have shown, have distinctive spatial frequencies and,
    within a system, spatial frequency within a particular tuning range, which result
    from particular combinations of shapes and modulation patterns. If you change
    the modulation pattern applied to the same set of shapes, or change the set of
    shapes to which you apply the same modulation pattern, you end up with different
    spatial frequency. This is what I demonstrated in that older thread, in which
    I illustrated Latin letters written with a Devanagari modulation pattern: you
    end up with a spatial frequency that a) is atypical of the Latin script and b)
    -- more critically, I think -- varies more than the typical spatial frequency,
    which may be problematic for reading. Why should this be so? Because writing systems
    have evidently evolved as mechanisms for achieving particular spatial frequencies,
    so that reading is not disrupted by re-tuning. That is to say, the combinations
    of shapes and modulation patterns have been well chosen.\r\n\r\nErgo, the solution
    to comfortable writing for lefties cannot simply be to mirror the position of
    right-handed writers with the same tools -- hence flipping the modulation pattern
    -- without also considering the shapes that are being formed. In effect, what
    you would need is a separate script for lefties that enabled them to produce new
    combinations of shape and modulation pattern. "

    better if you could explain.</em>\r\n\r\nI mean spatial frequency that, within
    an individual writing system, falls within one of the perceptual tuning bands.
    Another thing to note about this phenomenon is that it is scalable, such that
    even when different weights are applied to a script style, naturally resulting
    in differences of spatial frequency between the weights, within each weight the
    same tuning applies. This is no small feat, especially when one considers is is
    arrived at by generations of writers and readers who have no scientific understanding
    of spatial frequency and its r\xF4le in reading, i.e. it is arrived at by something
    like natural selection.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nWhile, as you say, Legato -- and type
    design in general -- is outside the scope of a thread about lefty handwriting,
    I think it is worth pausing to consider what Legato represents in terms of combinations
    of shape and modulation pattern. What Evert managed so well is to create strong
    typical shapes of Latin letters with a new, tool-independent modulation pattern
    that maintains consistent spatial frequency. The modulation pattern is the innovation,
    and the strong typicality of the shapes and the consistent spatial frequency are
    what makes it successful. If, in order to accommodate the novel modulation, the
    letter shapes had needed to diverge significantly from typical models, the resulting
    typeface would have joined various idiosyncratic experiments that are practically
    useless as fonts for setting text that anyone wants to read. If the novel modulation
    had resulted in inconsistent spatial frequency, such that different letters required
    different perceptual tuning, this would predictably result in slower reading speeds.\r\n\r\nSo,
    how does this relate to lefty handwriting? Obviously, in handwriting, the modulation
    pattern is not tool-independent; therefore, the kind of control that Evert had
    that enabled him to introduce a new modulation pattern <em>while not disrupting
    either typical shapes or spatial frequency consistency</em> is not available.
    It seems to me, in that case, that the only way you can achieve those goals in
    left-handed writing -- if one rejects repositioning of the arm or rotation of
    the page -- is to use a tool that produces little or no stroke modulation, because
    any tool that results in strong modulation is going to produce either inconsistent
    spatial frequency or divergence from normal letter shapes.\r\n\r\nIt is not that
    'righties are obsessing about proper [modulation]'*, but that readers are expecting
    typical <em>shapes,</em> and the shapes of letters have been arrived at evolutionarily
    in ways that favour particular modulation patterns in order to produce consistent
    spatial frequency. In type design, as Evert showed, these modulation patterns
    can be mutated through tool-independent manipulation, but in writing there is
    always a tool that, however manipulated, has an impact on the modulation pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n*
    I'm trying to avoid using the word ductus to mean modulation pattern, as the term
    has a more proper use in discussing writing, i.e. the stroke construction pattern
    of an individual letter, literally the 'path'."
