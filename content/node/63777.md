body: "Hello fine critics! \r\n\r\nI'm working on a wordmark for a boutique book-bindery,
  called Wings for Willkie - a nod to Wendell Willkie's 1940 presidential race. After
  thorough discussion with their brave founder we've settled on an 'inky war-journal'
  look for the wordmark: a handwritten script, marked by the formal ease of the habitual
  correspondent. \r\n\r\nI've attached my initial attempt - but I'm afraid I'm deeply
  unaccustomed to designing script. Especially a loose, handwritten script. Advice
  narrow or broad would be delightful! Deep thanks, \r\n\r\n\r\nReed\r\n\r\n(a few
  notes: I know the double-story 'g' and the roman 's' are most irregular. But for
  legibility and my love of ornate 'g's I submit their plea - am I wrong?)"

  body: "\"wi\" and \"for\" (<em>especially</em> \"for\") are great. Whatever you
    do, don't alter \"for.\" It's absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I can't
    be too helpful about scripts. (Just don't touch the \"for.\" Did I mention that?)"

    journal.\"\r\n\r\nIf it were me, I'd check out the P22 Foundry scripts for inspiration.
    [[http://www.p22.com/products/gauguinpro.html|Gauguin Pro]] comes to mind. "

  body: "Ah yes - I do love some of P22's scripts. I've sourced from Declaration Pro
    and Michaelangelo. You're right about the femininity of the mark - perhaps a subconscious
    response to designing for a female-run company. I'll talk to Marisa and see if
    I should macho it up a bit. \r\n\r\nSo with fresh eyes, I'm starting to wonder
    if the 'g' is a bit rococo - should I tone it down?"

  body: "Yes, the two story 'g' is not working. Takes all the attention away from
    the other characters. Go with something more like the 'g' in 'regular' in the
    specimen on the gauguin pro link posted by alaskan above. The 's' also looks lonely
    out there on his own.\r\n\r\npenn"
