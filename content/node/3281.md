    <BR> <BR>It never ceases to amaze me how uninspired the typography of TEX tends
    to be. There must be some sort of inverse relationship between design aptitude
    and ability to grasp TEX.  <BR> <BR>I thought the extra-inclusive pangram near
    the bottom of the page was pretty cool, though.'

  body: 'Indeed. But maybe the following explains why the TeX type is generally function
    over form: <BR> <BR><i>quite a few TeX installations are routinely using commercial
    Type 1 fonts, especially if they&#39;re not producing heavily technical material;
    only Computer Modern &#40;the font Knuth developed&#41;, Lucida Bright, and Times
    have anywhere near a comprehensive symbol complement, and none of the symbol sets
    are from &#34;major&#34; font suppliers &#40;too much work, not enough money;

    &#40;although it&#39;s actually slanted by [an average of] 1/2 a degree&#41; is
    FF Seria. Of course that one doesn&#39;t work either. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
