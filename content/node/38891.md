  body: Ouch! I've been told not to get the first version of any new software, siims
    like a solid piece of advice.

  body: "While this does seem to be a real issue, please note that the data-loss problem
    is only happening in a very particular situation: when you have mounted a volume
    on a network server, and that server happens to disconnect at the same time a
    directory (folder) is being moved to the server.\r\n\r\nThe bug doesn't seem to
    occur if you're using your Mac on its own, or even with an external (Firewire)
    hard drive.\r\n\r\nHowever, you may be affected by this even <em>without</em>
    upgrading: some claim the data-loss problem is <em>not</em> unique to Leopard,
    but has existed for some time -- perhaps even back to Panther.\r\n\r\nThe workaround,
    if you're looking for one, is to <em>copy</em> the files instead of <em>moving</em>
    them, then delete the original when you know the copy succeeded.\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: Thanks, John. I should've posted a little more information. I've been contemplating
    upgrading and it is articles like this one that have me holding off. I will still
    wait for a second version.

  body: "I don't think most Mac users even know that \"move\" exists. I kind of remember
    hearing about it, but have never used it. It didn't exist in pre-OS X Mac systems,
    as far as I know.\r\n\r\nNormally, in the Finder, when you drag an item from one
    volume to another, it copies the item to the second volume, leaving a copy on
    the original volume. If you don't want the item on the original volume, you delete
    it. This is the way I've always moved stuff between volumes, and I believe this
    is what most other Mac users do.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a short cut method,
    introduced in OS X. If you hold the command key down when you drag something from
    one volume to another, the original item is deleted after it is copied to the
    second volume. This is the \"move\" operation that is affected by this bug. \r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't call the first method a workaround, since that's the way (as far as I
    know) that most users work. It's a workaround only if you have a habit of using
    the short cut method."

  body: I never knew about "move". I have always copied things the old way. In part
    because I try to keep my files in at least two places at any given time in case
    of hard drive crashes (something I've encountered more than once). This is good
    to know, altho like Tiff I never buy the first version of anything Mac.

  body: "My Leopard-upgrade has been relatively painless (I have had worst transitions).
    Although I  intended to wait until Adobe would update the CS3 suite (announced
    for late november), I took the plunge on Monday last week and even risked an \"Update\"
    instead of an \"Archive and Install\". Felt I could do that, because I don't have
    to make a living on my Mac now.\r\n\r\nAfter the quick procedure (took less than
    an hour) I took a few progras for a short testride. Since I have about 340 programs
    on my HD that was by no means an exhaustive test. But anyway: all of the essential
    ones functioned, eg all of the CS3 Design Premium Suite, Quark 7.3, the MS Office
    Suite, FontAgentPro, EyeTV, even InDesign CS2 and PhotoShop CS2. Some of the programs
    had small issues, that were mostly solved because Leopard-compatible versions/upgrades
    appeared the last two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe problems I anticipated with the Epson
    R2400 printer I use for my girlfriend's portfolioprints were resolved by the timely
    (but unannounced) posting by Epson of new drivers.\r\n\r\nThere are some changes
    in the way Leopard handles printing and the setup of printers, that take getting
    used to \u2014 but that may be my age telling\u2026\r\n\r\nI don't have TimeMachine
    running, because I am waiting for delivery of two new HD's for my Mac.\r\n\r\nTen
    days into this 'trial' I have not experienced serious issues with Leopard. \r\n\r\n.
