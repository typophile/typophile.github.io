body: Ok, I hate fake italics as much as the next person, but I need some help...  <BR>
  <BR>How come some typefaces &#40;that don&#39;t come with an italic&#41; can be
  obliqued in Quark and they print fine, while others strip out the obliquing and  print
  as roman?  <BR> <BR>Is there a quick fix that can be done to a font to get it to
  accept Quark&#39;s fake italicizing?

  body: The method I use to be certain it is going to print is to create it in Illustrator
    &#40;or a similar vector graphic program&#41;, outline and import it in Quark.
    Even if a printer can print out the Quark formatting there is no guarantee that
    it will remain formatted when it goes to film/plate. As a general rule I steer
    clear of all the formatting options for type for Quark.

  body: As a general rule, I do as well. In this instance we&#39;ve created an obliqued
    version of the face in Fontographer, which isn&#39;t beautiful but will do the
    trick. <BR> <BR>For future reference, can anyone explain what it is <i>technically</i>
    that allows only some fonts to be &#34;italicized&#34;?
