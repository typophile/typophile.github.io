body: This is my second attempt at type design and I would find it beneficial to get
  it critiqued in it&#39;s early stages. I hope the sketch is tight enough to show
  the direction in which i would like to go. Two things I want to find out; the first
  is wether this project is even worth pursuing and second, do the letters have a
  certain harmony to them &#40; please try to ignore the letter &#39;s&#39; in your
  examination as i have not spent much time developing it  and consider it &#39;unfinished&#39;&#41;.  <BR>

  body: Uau Giovanni.  Very nice, I like it. <BR>Thanks for posting the sketch.  Take
    care of the &#39;s&#39;! <BR>Ain&#39;t interesting that Egyptians were using the
    symbol <BR>of a sword to represent the &#39;s&#39; sound? <BR>I think it worth
    pursuing, try to fill those letters <BR>to have a better understanding of the
    white around. <BR>Then you can take a trip to San Serriffe islands <BR>and work
    on yo&#39; tan upon Gill Sands beaches. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>AS <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54563.jpg"

  body: Some very interesting glyphs you have for a starting point. I may be wrong,
    but I am guessing that you have been looking at a lot of fonts you really like
    &#40;including Lux typographics/ Esquire magazines Crank8 font for the second
    &#34;k&#34;. and perhaps work from UK&#39;s The Foundry as well. I am NOT suggesting
    that you should not use these as starting points, nor that the work is &#34;copied&#34;
    but I do think it it influenced and there is nothing wrong with that. Did you
    &#40; like I have done myself in the past&#41; decided if only I could fit all
    these unusual tweaks into a single font it would be the &#34;ultimate&#34;. Seems
    like a <BR>great idea. Well be careful, for it become a very difficult task. Hrant
    gave me very good advice once, which was &#34;be careful of glyph love&#34;. And
    by the way I really like the glyphs you have here regardless of where the ideas
    came from .   <BR>Is it worth persuing? Yes. Next step is unification. &#34;o&#34;
    is very cool but will not fit with rest. The more tweaks the less userbility.

    like&#60; <BR> <BR>Well I haven&#39;t been looking at other fonts to be honest
    with you. I thought I could &#39;start from scratch&#39; &#40;if there is such
    a thing&#41;. But I must admit that at a subconscious level I was influenced.
    I had no idea of the similarities! But I do admit the second &#39;k&#39; was seen
    in the Esquire magazine i subcribe too. I just love it. You&#39;re right about
    &#39;o&#39; it does not fit, sometimes i get carried away. I will take your advice
    to heart about the tweaks on each glyph. Too much does hinder userbility. what
    do u think about the &#39;g&#39; , &#39;b&#39; and &#39;d&#39; do they fit? I
    think they might be off. Thanks fror the critique you guys. <BR> <BR>Any more
    suggestions, anyone? <BR> <BR>IM'

  body: Well, this is a bit discouraging. <BR>It&#39;s seems that the type i hoped
    would be somewhat original reminds people of other fonts. I honestly thought that
    not looking at other sources for inpiration might  help in avoiding this kind
    of &#39;confusion&#39; in terms giving my design it&#39;s own identity.  <BR>
    <BR>Well &#39;A&#39; , to answer your question I guess they are some similarities
    to the fon&#39;t Solex, but i feel my design might be just different enough to
    &#39;stand out&#39;. <BR> <BR>To be honest with you I feel like I have this all
    wrong now.  How does one design great typefaces that stand out and not look like
    everything else? Can such thing be accomplished? I hope there is someone out there
    with advice that can help me. I really feel like I have the potential for good
    type design &#40; I know this because of the love i have for the printed word
    and typography&#41; and i don&#39;t want to give up on this! <BR> <BR>Any advice

  body: 'I don&#39;t think it looks like Solex at all, but the reason I for one hadn&#39;t
    commented is because it does in fact seem to be a &#34;me too&#34; design &#40;even
    though I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t do that intentionally&#41;. This style is in
    the air, I guess. But what you have so far can still serve as a great starting
    point I think. Here&#39;s an idea: try adding stroke contrast - most such designs
    are monoline. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    What exactly do you mean by adding more stroke contrast? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Ivan

    I did not continue the work, because i wanted to make something new and the new
    designs reminded me too much of Yellow. But, go ahead. And, please, try that &#42;o&#42;
    with the contrasting diagonals. If you go from there and apply this principle
