  body: Nice funny script! I love the reflection you have on some letter created by
    the loop  (T,l,g). Though, I wonder if the s in lower case and caps, could be
    mistaken for an 8.

  body: Indeed a very cute font and specially cute with the colors you have shown
    in the preview. As one of the cute quotes by William S. Burroughs states -  cuteness
    is delineated by what it is not. Perhaps this would make a good font for my quotations
    website http://cutequotesandsayings.com . However I am concerned about the readability
    and load time. This is definitely a cute font to write couple of important head
    lines or quotes on a flyer.
