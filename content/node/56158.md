    you know, \"Satyagraha\" was a campaign ran by Mahatma Gandhi while struggling
    for the Indian independence."

    ideal for man, I strongly believe. And I dream of another Satya Yuga.

  body: "Looks like I missed out an interesting talk. Satya, I need to clarify that
    I actually meant Satyagraha when I was saying Satya, I take Satya for short. Sorry
    about confusion. \r\n\r\n@ Satyagraha\r\n\r\nThanks for your info bit. I didn't
    know \"Satyagraha\" IS a single word as campaign for Mahatma Gandi. So I split
    it into \"two\" words following my linguistic intuition. You can call me JZ, acronym
    of my English name. Metaspace is just a fake id. :-)\r\n\r\nJZ"
