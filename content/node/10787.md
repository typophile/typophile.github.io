    does not seem to go all that well with the small caps. <BR> <BR>Someone also said
    that when they are not slightly taller than the lowercase characters, they suck.

    It can often be the case,  <BR>but depends of course on the original proportions
    of UC/lc  <BR>to begin with. In faces with a large x-height they&#39;ll  <BR>probably
    look better if they&#39;re the same height as the lc. <BR> <BR>&#40;&#42;&#41;
    This is not the only difference between a small-cap  <BR>and a scaled-down full

    <BR> <BR>... &#40;if you don&#39;t have small caps for a certain typeface&#41;
    using the small caps function is akin to using faux bolds and italics? A computer-generated

  body: '1&#41; A face that doesn&#39;t have enough room for smallcaps between the

    There&#39;s virtually zero harm in confusing smallcaps with fullcaps &#40;I mean
    in their usual usage of acronyms in running text, as opposed to fancy titling&#41;,
    while there is in confusing them with lc. <BR> <BR>So you could conclude that
    a font with a huge x-height doesn&#39;t need smallcaps that much. <BR> <BR>And
    I personally would go further: a good text face has very short caps &#40;much
    shorter than current -or past- convention&#41; - it doesn&#39;t need smallcaps,
    at least not that much - there are [generally] more important things to worry
    about. Not least because virtually nobody uses smallcaps, even if the font has
    it right under their noses... <BR> <BR>&#62; &#43;0.2pt <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know
    how much larger they need to be - it simply has to be a visible difference, in
    fact some distance into the parafovea. BTW, it&#39;s interesting that the smaller
    the point size the larger the absolute difference necessary. The problem here
    is that at very smaller point sizes the x-height needs to be larger too - I guess
    one could conclude that smallcaps have little place in tiny typography. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Good catch. I was sloppy. <BR> <BR>The first part assumes conventional proportions
    - caps slightly smaller than ascenders. Which is why when x-height/cap-height
    is too large, so is x-height/ascenders &#40;a key factor in readability&#41;.
    In fact my proposal &#40;making caps notably smaller than ascenders&#41; goes
    hand-in-hand with reducing the necessity of smallcaps. Is that clearer? <BR> <BR>BTW,
    I think necessity is simply relative. An ideal face will have smallcaps &#40;even
    if the x-height is large&#41;, but to me it&#39;s much more important to have
    sized masters, for example - which very few people do. Too many people are making
    smallcaps &#40;not to mention the dreaded Unicase&#41; instead of spending the
    time on more important things. And it seems to be a peer-pressure situation. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>If this old image can help?! <BR>the yellow R is the capital, the small
    R outline is the small caps version, and the bolder outline is the same R small
    caps enlarged at the size of R capital. <BR> <BR>On this example, the lc is missing
    to achieve a perfect demo. <BR> <BR>When I design SC, I start generally with a
    close to perfect balance between lc and cap weight, then, interpolation between
    the regular and bold original caps, then, redesign of all serifs. I make most
    of them wider, more open with generally lower contrast between the letter widths.
    The eyes still the best judge at the end. Note that the OsF figures match the
    SC in weight and size.
