    might check dafont for Stencil fonts: it appears there are intentional breaks
    in the letters...'

  body: There's also the possibility that's it isn't a font, as there are no like
    characters in your sample that are identical.

  body: Assuming that the lines are supposed to be crisp and the characters of similar
    heights, I'm with you, David. In fact, all but the S could be easily cobbled together
    this way.

  body: "I think we can probably solve this as being hand lettered... the customer
    wanted the word silver sewn in the same font as prestancia. I worked with it for
    a bit and just pulled what I could of the letters. the only thing I really had
    to work through is the kerning and the L would you guys see the L as not being
    at a 45 degree angle as I saw? below is the result I came up with I am just awaiting
    the customers approval now.  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/silver_5222.jpg]"
