  of mine brought in a logo of which itc-american-typewriter was used. \r\nHowever
  the ampersand from my version? of itc-american-typewriter differs from the one used
  in the logo.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me figure out why they differ?\r\n\r\nThis is
  what the customers version looks like:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amp_3709.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
  is what my ampersand looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amp2_5078.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"
