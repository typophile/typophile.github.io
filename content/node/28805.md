body: "I have narrowed down from 4 concepts to this layout for my Book Design class.
  The book in a nutshell is about a man and woman who have an affair in the 60's,
  which ends up producing a \"flower child\" daughter. The girl grows up without any
  contact with her father until she randomly runs into him on the train while going
  to work, he's in pretty bad shape and the first thing she notices is the plaid raggedy
  jacket he's wearing. The father is always thinking about his past and the mother
  is always looking into the future, they're both ignoring the consequence of their
  encounter and as such the daughter is spinning out of control.\r\n\r\nThis isn't
  due for another 10 days, but since I have the layout pretty much nailed, it's all
  about the details. My choice of typeface: Egyptian 505 is to make another connection
  besides the flower to the 60s where this whole story began. The one question I have
  is about how to space the letters in the title on the cover as each line is a different
  point size to accomodate the justification. Right now I think MAN is too loose and
  I'll need to upsize it a few points and tighten the spacing. I've run PDF optimizer
  on it as to facilitate a less bulky download.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this layout?"

  body: "While I like the concept & design I'm not getting much of a 60s feel, the
    shoes look pretty contemporary to me. Maybe something groovier? Or a brighter
    background color?\r\n\r\nA few brief comments - the type on the spine doesn't
    look centered.\r\n\r\nCan you eliminate the shoelace? I'm not loving where it
    hits the N.\r\n\r\nThe woman's leg on the back is a little too subtle - I'd taper
    it a bit more so it doesn't look like a mistake - it's a nice idea. Maybe you
    don't need a full line break between the paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe word spacing inside
    the leg is a bit dodgy - 2nd para 2nd line is way tight. I'd try to avoid hyphenation
    if you can (mod-ern in the 3rd para)\r\n\r\nI think the author's name should get
    more emphasis than \"A Novel by\" also by shouldn't be capitalized.\r\n\r\nFinally
    - I like the rose but will it read when the cover is folded around an entire book?
    Have  you looked at that? I'm not sure a rose reads 60s either, maybe a daisy?"

  body: The cleaver womans leg shape on the back cover doesn't work. It looks like
    a mistake and the third paragagraph of type has horrible rivers running through
    it. Try for once thinking like an average person buying a book. They are not designers
    and the visual pun will sail over their heads. You are trying to sell the book,
    don't play with the copy like that. I agree loose the rose and go daisy. Also
    if the author is important I'd make his name prominate, the author can sell books.
    Steven Kings name would never be small. Did you look at stroking the type on the
    title. It seems weak. If it were in a display stand could you read it at 5 or
    10 feet, I doubt it. You have a nice design, for design sake but it falls short
    of what a book seller would want - Sales! Think marketing, think about your target
    audience

  body: "Patty: I always appreciate your ideas, and you do work with books for a career
    if I remember right so your point of view is important! I forgot to mention, the
    origin of the story is in the 60s but it takes place in present day, so I wanted
    to reference the 60s a bit but not go totally 1960 in the look.\r\n\r\nI had actually
    removed the tongue of the boot and then put it back in, couldn't make up my mind.
    I've also been going back and forth about the woman's leg, I didn't mention it
    in the first post, hoping to get straight up opinions about if it was too subtle.
    I'm thinking of just ditching the idea, but keeping the copy there with the same
    general column width and just left justifying it. Still tweaking colors etc and
    was thinking the same about the background color.\r\n\r\nAgaink, thank you for
    your insight.\r\n\r\nDan: The author isn't really all that prominent, but good
    point. I went to a few book stores and checked out displays and book design to
    get an idea about how this aspect of the industry works. If it was a prominent
    author I would definitely agree!"

  body: "I have to admit I didn't see the woman's leg at all, I was more struck by
    an out of balance shape on the back cover, to avoid the need for a hyphenated
    blurb you could perhaps use the lefthand margin of the text to outline the edge
    of the leg, although that might be even more subtle. However, the Patty Hearst
    line is really too cramped, you might need to massage the measure a bit. On the
    cover type I find the plaid distracting where the highlight stops just below BACK,
    bumping it up to include the start of the highlight in the first line might help,
    moving it might also give the opportunity to put a little bit of contrast in the
    lefthand serif of the A in WARD. As you have ligated the ARD I think the MAN could
    also be that tight. The inter-line spaces on the title need to appear equal. The
    alignment on the front cover type, I can see you have aligned the verticals of
    the lettering, however, because of the fairly heavy serifs and the tightness to
    the spine a ragged gap will be obvious. A little bit of kerning on the spine would
    be good. On the front the author's name is floating a bit.\r\n\r\nTim"
