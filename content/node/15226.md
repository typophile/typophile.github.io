  would love to hear about exhibits/lectures/events/locations of a typographic, calligraphic,
  and inscriptional nature. My main focus is art museums, but I'd like to see letters
  cut in stone, and type/book arts/manuscript shows, etc.\r\nMy hotels are in city
  centers and I won't be renting a car.\r\nI'll be deeply grateful for any tips!\r\nI'll
  be going through:\r\nLondon ( I know about St. Brides, British Library, etc.)\r\nAntwerp
  (Plantin-Moretus museum)\r\nBruges (I'm visiting Brody Neuenschwander)\r\nAmsterdam\r\nParis\r\nFlorence\r\nVenice
  (am I right that there's little of printing history there now?)\r\nRome (Epigraphical
  museum)\r\nAssisi\r\nI return to the US on 11 November, in tatters!\r\nThanks very
  much for any info.\r\nBrian\r\nbdallen@mac.com\r\nmy photo album and travel blog

    ride & tour to the Armenian monastery on San Lazzaro. The Mekhitarist order housed
    on that island did the first Armenian printing from movable type (they also did
    printing in a couple of dozen other languages too) and as surreal as Venice is,
    that place is doubly so... It's like stepping back centuries.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
