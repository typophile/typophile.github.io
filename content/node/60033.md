  or [[http:/www.iloveny.com]]. Its like a slab serif, Rockwell or so, but with more
  distinguished characteristics. For instance, the lowercase l, t and h are long in
  height. \r\n\r\nI tried whatthefont and identifont, but no success here. \r\n\r\nI
  am sure you guys can help me with this. Or maybe somebody can show me a perfect
  match free alternative, would be amazing..\r\n\r\nI am bloody rookie in typography,
  but well there is always a start. \r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nThis is an example.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/user_resources_faq_header_5688.gif]"
