body: Having tried Suitcase, Font Reserve, and Font Agent Pro, for Mac X  and disliking
  all of them for some reason or another, I recently installed Master Juggler 3. After
  two days of using it I have to say it is wonderful. No Auto Activation yet, but
  it supports Unicode and it does not need to keep running in the background. No copying
  fonts either. Works very much like the old MJ use to work, straight forward and
  very reliable. <BR> <BR>The best part is Alsoft&#39;s customer service. I ordered
  directly from them, they looked up my old registered copy from about 10 years ago,
  and gave me the upgrade price, even after I told them there was no way I would know
  my old serial number. <BR> <BR>Very nice stuff.

    still puzzled at why they haven&#39;t offered a demo.  <BR>I need to try before
    I&#39;ll buy.
