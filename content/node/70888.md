body: "Hi all - I've got a mystery font that was used on a military plaque that was
  made between 1945 and 1976 (circumstantial evidence suggests the plaque was most
  likely made between 1945 and 1947).  It has a serif style that is similar to the
  fonts listed below:\r\n\r\nAmplitude BRK\r\nCombustion BRK\r\nCombustion Plain BRK\r\nCombustion
  II BRK\r\nCombustion Wide BRK\r\n\r\n...but the shapes of most of the letters and
  numbers don't match any of these.\r\n\r\nI apologize in advance for the poor quality
  of the image - it's the best I could do.  \r\n\r\nI've been trying to identify this
  font for the longest time - everyone who's had a look so far has been stumped.  Thanks
  in advance."

  body: Since you found this type on a plaque, my guess is that it's something peculiar
    to an engraving machine manufacturer, such as Hermes. The closest precursor I
    could find was a face called <strong>Curved Egyptian</strong>, from the 1888 James
    Connor's Sons specimen book.

  body: "The \"HAMBURGEFONS\" sample suggests that this is a foundry sample, rather
    than anything from a military plaque. Are you sure you posted the image you intended?\r\n\r\nAlso
    what is the source of these BRK fonts? Are these from some font CD you have?\r\n\r\n(BTW,
    the font design of \"Bryant Font Chopped\" looks rather crude, and not much like
    I would expect to see on a military plaque.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi - thanks for the responses.  The image I posted was something I pasted
    together in photoshop.  I figured those letters would be the ones that people
    might find most useful for identification.  The image I have of the mystery font
    portion of the plaque exceeds the width limit for posted images on this board,
    but I'll post the original from the plaque here, cut in two pieces.\r\n\r\nThe
    image itself is crude.  I once had a higher-resolution image of it, but lost that
    years ago.  I agree - the font itself doesn't look like what you'd expect on a
    military plaque.  This plaque was made to commemorate sailors killed by a kamikaze
    attack, and my guess is that it was probably commissioned and paid for by the
    crew itself rather than the navy, hence the slightly informal appearance of it.\r\n\r\nThe
    plaque was lost when the ship was scrapped in the 70s, and the crewmembers have
    been trying to track it down in the years since.  I'm trying to get a replica
    made for them, but can't just yet because I haven't been able to identify this
    font.\r\n\r\nFunny, but I realized this request is kind of timely, with today
    being Memorial Day!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bryant_left_4791.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bryant_right_6077.jpg]"

  body: "This looks like a late 19th century squared Tuscan style, if there was such
    a thing. I tried to look for squared fonts with, or without, serifs, that might
    be a starting point to re-create this look. A sans that seems to have approximately
    the right shapes is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/stratum2/\">Stratum
    2</a>. By adding flattened V-shaped serifs to this you might get close.\r\n\r\nOther
    fonts that had sort of this look were Kwersity, Railway Point, Valgal and Wyoming
    Pastad (all at MyFonts). They all had straight serifs, but those could be replaced.\r\n\r\nAnother
    sans that had the right 'skeleton' was <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/serpentine-sans/\">Serpentine
    Sans</a>, although it's not a monotone font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
