  to (local) history, and have come across a source (original text is in German, published
  in Switzerland in 1798) that lists a few statements. Interestingly, the ordinal
  numbers don't use periods as they would in German today (\xAB1.\xBB, etc.), but
  some sort of ordinal-o-type character. In my direct text source that cites this
  text, degree signs were used, but I doubt those are correct. \r\n\r\nI don't have
  access to the original source. Does anyone happen to know what sort of symbol would
  historically have been used for this? Maybe I should use/make some sort of superscript
  lowercase \"oh\"?\r\n\r\nHere's how it looks currently, with degree signs:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aufzaehlungsboelleli_6135.gif]\r\nThanks
  for any input!"

    On my German keybord I get it via alt-J\r\nThe use of the \xB0 sign for this is
    a frequent poor-mens workaround, to be avoided whenever possible.\r\n\r\nGr\xFC\xDFe

  body: "You'll find that a lot of fonts have these two ordinals underlined, which
    maybe why /degree/ was resorted to. A typeface worth its salt will include at
    the very least a limited range of ordinals abdehilmnorst (or similar) which are
    not underlined. Some fonts will give you all 26 latin superiors, some will even
    give you them in upper case also.\r\n\r\nN"

  body: "Here in Italy, where ordinal indicators are used somewhat often (surely more
    often than degree signs), either you have access to a character palette or the
    only way to type something vaguely similar is using \xB0. Not that the layman
    could even know (or care) it isn't a ordinal indicator. After all, it's right
    there on the keyboard.\r\nThe worst case happens when it's used in place of the
    feminine ordinal indicator too."
