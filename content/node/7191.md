  logo, but the only information seemed to be that it was a custom.  &#40;If anyone
  knows, I would still love to know the font.&#41; <BR> <BR>This time around, I am
  wondering if anyone knows the font used for their main type that can be found on
  this page: <BR><a href="http://www.emirates.com/usa/index.asp" target="_blank">http://www.emirates.com/usa/index.asp</a>

  most distinct letters are A, E, and Y. <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR>-Will'

  body: I believe this is a customed designed family of fonts simply called EK &#40;the
    E likely stand for Emirates&#41; as EK-Bold, etc. The lettering you&#39;re asking
    about is the same custom typeface but a lighter weight. Below is a larger version
    of the typeface. It was designed in house by their corporate communications design
    team. See <a href="http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/Spanish/news/newsdetails.asp?NType=S&amp;NewsID=117"
