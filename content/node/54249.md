  Nouveau\r\nHere is a poster by Emmanuel Orazi for La Maison Moderne in 1905. This
  later art nouveau piece moves the texture away from the flowery embellished borders
  and backgrounds, instead creating texture with the typography.\r\n\r\nThis is an
  interesting composition because although there is great detail in the imagery, the
  detailed images are set in the background. The foreground image of the woman is
  relatively flat which creates this spatial quality of a two dimensional woman in
  a three dimensional world. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04-11_el_lissitzky_cover_4120.jpg]\r\nConstructivism\r\nHere
  is a classic example of constructivism. This cover was designed by El Lissitzky
  for Wendingen in 1941. I enjoy breaking down this cover and I feel there is a certain
  conformity to this seemingly fractured design. I categorize the shapes by those
  which are rotated, and those which are not rotated. In each of these categories,
  the shapes stay at 90 degrees of each other. So it appears as if there were two
  designs based on two grids, then Lissitzky simply rotated one of the grids by about
  30 degrees. But ask yourself this: Are the circles (including the partial circle
  at the bottom) on the rotated grid or the natural grid? Why?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/studioDumbar_5_4649.jpg]\r\nDutch
  Design\r\nIt doesn't feel right to exclude Dutch design in a post about 20th century
  design. So alas, here we have a poster by Gert Dumbar for a Piet Zwart exhibition,
  date unknown. This poster contains all the fun stuff we've come to love from dutch
  design: incorporated photographs, 45 degree angles, and much activated space. This
  poster leaves me wondering how much was an actual photograph and how much was composed
  into this final composition. Notice the illusionary dimension added by painting
  a wall that appears to extend the room, but no attempt is made to cover the seam
  where the real wall meets the floor. This illusion is common in Baroque art, where
  artists would extend the ceiling in a room to show the saints and the heavens."

    even call their collective selves one \"movement\" with only nationalist separation.
    There was enough difference inside each of these among various members to encompass
    the the other countries as well. From Moholy-Nagy to, Van Doesburg to Schwitters
    to Piet Zwart to Rodchenko, Malevich, El Lissitzky, there was more a singleness
    than a differentiation.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
