  company for public entities. The requirements they gave me was to use kelly green
  and navy blue, include the state of california, and use a script font for \"Cal\"
  and serif font for \"HOPE\". I have attached what I came up with... any feedback,
  please?\r\n\r\n"

- body: "\r\nOnce again, I agree with Ratbaggy. There is a lot more to designing a
    logo than following literal directions of a client. \r\n\r\nHonesty?  Ok, but
    it's brutal.\r\n\r\nThe client could do what you've done by themselves. Where's
    the polish? Where's the relationship between the typefaces? Where's any considerations
    of shape or style? Why would you draw a map of California <em>so literally</em>
    it looks like grade school clip art?\r\n\r\nWarned you. \r\nSorry...but sometimes
    honesty is needed."

  body: when I get such restricted direction from a client, I usually create one exactly
    as they discribed (even if it looks dreadful) and couple more versions of my own.
    Remeber, sudden clients already have a visual sets in stone and they just need
    someone to bring it to life.

  body: "OK, thank you for the brutal  honesty! (that's why I came here instead of
    asking friends or family) I am a beginner with logos and I will take any advice
    you have. \r\n\r\nI did try a set that had different typefaces- mostly sans serifs,
    and some color variations. However, the client didn't like those. I do agree that
    if I do something really great that stands out the client may just get rid of
    all the restrictions and choose that idea. Which would be ideal. Somehow I'm just
    not getting there. I sometimes get a mental block and find it hard to work on
    projects that are for things I don't know much about/have much interest in- such
    as insurance companies. "
