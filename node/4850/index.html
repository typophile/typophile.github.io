  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Am I getting old or what? Yeah, It's rhetorical. <BR> <BR>I seem to be finding a lot of examples of bad color choices with type. The latest example that drove me nuts was from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design catalog for continuing education classes. Dark yellow type on lilac. You can download the equally irritating pdf by clicking on the &quot;Summer Course Catalog&quot; link from this page: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.mcad.edu/continue/fs-continue.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.mcad.edu/continue/fs-continue.htm">http://www.mcad.edu/continue/fs-continue.htm</a></a> <BR> <BR>It reminds me of a local eatery called  The French Meadow Bakery &ndash; their coffee menu is written in brick red chalk on a black chalkboard. I told a friend, &quot;If I hadn't had any, I sure as heck wouldn't be able to order it from that!&quot; <BR></div>

Most of the entries, as usual, were pretty, but lacked in all sorts of other design criteria (usability, accessibility, functionality, etc.). It's that kind of thing that bums me out.</div>

I think it's OK to go overboard, but it's not OK to make something unreadable in the process. Maybe I've turned into a hack, but I always ask myself, &quot;Is this doing anything to enhance communication?&quot; If it's not helping, it gets cut. If it's actively hindering communication, it gets cut, thrown on the floor and stomped.  <BR> <BR>The orange on purple text in the pdf is almost impossible to read. The printout on my color printer is difficult to read. Without the actual printed piece, I don't know how difficult it was to read, but judging from Krisin's original reaction, it wasn't good. <BR> <BR>If a client is paying for a design, I think the designer has an obligation to make it usable/readable. An unreadable piece might not be vanilla, but it's probably not a success. <BR> <BR>Nick: are you talking about the cover, or the insides?</div>
