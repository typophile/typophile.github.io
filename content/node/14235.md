  body: "Thanks guys,\r\n\r\nnicolai, I think you might be right. I had a look at
    both links and Cachet give the impression of rounded corners (or is that just
    my poor eyesight?) where Zamestro does not. Zamestro is very close but, as you
    said Stephen, it is hard to tell.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBrennan\r\n"
