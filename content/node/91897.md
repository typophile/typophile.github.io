body: "<!--break-->\r\nHello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm aiming for something quirky and
  light hearted. My approach was to design a rounded face which has some humanist
  character and a little bit of contrast between sharp and soft. There's influences
  from Gill, DIN and Futura in there.  \r\n\r\nUnothodoxly, soft edges have been used
  around the perimeter and straight lines on the horizontal terminals (e.g the tips
  of the r, l, t and s). My thinking was this would give a nice soft shape to the
  outline of the word, whilst allowing letters to sit tightly together harmoniously
  without awkward negative space. I.e. this: || not this: )|\r\n\r\nThis is my first
  font so I'd appreciate your comments! \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPete\r\n\r\n...FYI this
  is the second revision. PDF is attached.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/V2_5958.png]"

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to

    broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd\u2019s usually are not all
    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get

  body: "There doesn't appear to be any rationale for the mixture of flat and rounded
    termini. Some bottoms are flat, some rounded, as are other random stroke ends.\r\n\r\nMany
    of the glyphs were put together with pieces (was this done with fontstruct?) that
    don't always fit together properly. The PDF example shows gaps at some magnifications.
    This also causes mis-alignment at some magnifications (the 'a' shows its vertical
    parts at different widths, for example, with a pixel or two difference on-screen)\r\n\r\nThe
    connections between curved and straight strokes are inconsistant - the 'h' is
    markedly different from the 'n' for example. Most of the glyphs have a constant
    stroke width, so those that are markedly different tend to stand out like sore
    thumbs.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what characteristics make a character 'male' or 'female'
    or 'neuter'; or even humourous, comical, or serious! I don't tend to either laught
    at or fantasize about glyphs. \r\n\r\n  - Herb"

    \u2013 my aim isn't to produce a generic rounded font. The type was drawn from
    scratch in illustrator with a few bits borrowed across letters (hence the slightly
    sketchy stitching). The new version I've uploaded is more refined.\r\n\r\nThere
    is some thinking behind the round/straight edges, I've edited my original post
    to explain things.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?"

    thing I would suggest is to look at letter adjacency frequencies*. What I mean

    on what is most likely to end up next to what.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/5106\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Your Version 2 still has stylistic inconsistencies. You say that the horizontal
    termini are square, but they're still rounded on the y,  the crossbar of the t
    and both ends of the z.  The bottom of the 'j' is ambiguous - maybe that's your
    intention, but it has no equivalent elsewhere in the font.  The corner in the
    'a' makes it look like a ball ending - again, the only one with that particular
    appendage.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to attach an image of the 'a' at a fairly small size,
    with the image enlarged to display the break in rendering the separate segments.
