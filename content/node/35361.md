  description: Atcan is [i]the[/i] distribution company for new-brunswick Canada and
  a leader in the maritime provinces-they have one competitor at their level. They
  also do high end routing, demographics reports and sales and marketing consultation.
  They are presently undergoing a shift. Their main client Aliant has transfered the
  task of directory distribution to yellow pages. Atcan wishes to use this opportunity
  to revamp their corporate identity to better reflect who they truly are.\r\n\r\nAtcan,
  a company name which stands for Atlantic Canada, has many decades experience in
  the field. They use the most current software to accomplish their task and their
  methods are cutting edge. The also use these tools and skills to offer demographics
  reports to retailers in the area and they sell their experience through consulting
  services. They are not a typical service but for the clients they do cater to they
  are absolutely essential. A meeting with them quickly revealed the culture of professionalism
  that reigns at the Atcan office. \r\n\r\nAtcan's priority with the design is to
  shed the fly-by-night look of their existing ID while making it clear what they
  offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see the full creative process you can view the thread on HOW.

    to make an illustration into a logo.

    I'll try a heavier version and see what happens. \r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: Complex gradients are a pain in the butt to stick on the side of a truck with
    cut vinyl (and consequently much more expensive when other means are used). It
    seems this would be an important consideration.

    lesson from the concept here. If not the side of a truck then some other low-end
    repro method is going to come along. The mark should be simple enough for about
    any application. Flexo and many offset printers can't work with a dot lighter
    than 5%. A gradient that cuts off in a hard line is not attractive. The shape
    of the letters and the fit will make your point best."
