body: "Hello all, this question is in regards to body copy for print. My AD uses hyphens
  with flush left text but I was taught only to hyphenate with justified text. I agree
  it does create better rags but it just seems wrong to me. What are your thoughts?\r\n"

    I only read text \u2013 I do not write any."

    being added to shorter lines for a nicer rag."

  body: "Depending on the usecase, do it wisely, sparsely and/or to create visually
    appealing rags that also contribute to a proper outline leading to better readability.
    Try to use hyphens only in places that do not disturb the text's legibility (i.e.
    where two significant parts of a compound word meet, before/after pre-/suffixes,
    don't hyphenate proper names or in problematic cases like \"anal-phabetic\").
    If you cannot spend time and effort to do it properly, avoid it completely. This
    question also relates to different languages and national/regional conventions
    or norms with regard to typesetting, which are in part defined by language structure
    \u2013 e.g. agglutinating languages will likely have to use hyphenation in order
    to avoid underfull lines."
