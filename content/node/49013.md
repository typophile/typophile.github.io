  body: Definitely Eurostile, I think. Possibly scaled horizontally to make it more
    condensed. The spacing also seems tighter than normal.

    will bo the one!\r\n\r\nI would never have guessed it was as common as Eurostile
    - WhatTheFont gave me a list of about 10 fonts that I've never heard of. Maybe
    the scaling and spacing confused it slightly. Thanks anyway."
