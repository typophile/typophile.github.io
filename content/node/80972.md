  body: "According to the Michael Freimuth, who did the design work and identity for
    Glass Shop, it is a (unintended) customized version of 'Empire'. It is unreleased.\r\n\r\nMichael
    noted, \"I'd had a box of vintage pamphlets floating around my office a while
    back, and one in particular contained a face I thought would be a fit for Glass
    Shop \u2013 I scanned it and thought I'd found a beautifully random old face to
    re-build and work with \u2013 I redrew it from hand, and made some alternate weights
    and an italic version. It was quickly pointed out to me by an associate that I'd
    basically just made Morris Fuller Benton's 1937 'Empire' and when I looked more
    closely I believe that's exactly what it was.\r\n\r\nSo I essentially just re-built
    his original and all credit and apologies goes to him, though technically I believe
    some of the characters vary in weight and exact structure. But to be fair, let's
    just call it Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the previous requests for a match
    that Riccard pointed out are something else entirely, or *other* customizations
    of Empire (or Hastile as done for Nebiolo)?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As the source of this font has bugged me for a while, it seems the only two
    sources of type samples have come from (a) NEWWORK magazine, and (b) Glass Shop.
    Both in New York. Pretty sure it's the same custom typeface. A modified version
    of Empire.\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.newworkmag.com/images2/C_1.jpg</img>\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.newworkmag.com/images2/6_1.jpg</img>\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom
    Issue No 2:\r\n\r\n\"NEWWORK magazine is a large-format arts publication for Connoisseur
    of fresh ideas. Designed and published biannually by studio NEWWORK, each issue
    features new work from a wide range of artists and creators in the worlds of fine
    art, design, high fashion, culture, and politics. From art directors to business
    leaders, design students to curators, NEWWORK's contributors are united in their
    passion to push the boundaries of their disciplines. Among the magazine's special
    features are bold, <strong>custom-designed typefaces</strong> and a twist on the
    traditional newspaper format, offering a stimulating juxtaposition of striking
    design and everyday simplicity. Since pages can be separated, each layout can
    be hung on the wall as an individual art piece.\r\n\r\nWhile the first issue highlighted
    the work of artists and designers from New York's creative scene, issue no. 2
    of NEWWORK explores the role of imagination in creative life: changing styles,
    changing minds, changing worlds.\""
