body: "Hi everyone, I have always wanted to study typography but never got the chance
  to do it. I couldn't get into design school because I don't have any design/art
  background. Currently I'm studying a course that has nothing to with typography/design.
  I have studied the course for a year and finally realized that I want to pursue
  a career in typography/design. I will be joining, well actually forced to do national
  service as it is mandatory in Korea. I want to use my time wisely in the service
  and study typography but I don't have a clue where to start. Do you have any suggestions
  on how to study typography? I'm interested anything with typography and eventually
  want to design fonts. \r\n\r\nI will not be able to use a computer for personal
  use so anything with computer is out of picture.\r\n\r\nWould tracing/drawing fonts
  help to develop typography skills? If it does, is tracing better or drawing better?\r\n\r\nAre
  there any specific exercises for typography that can be done with pencil and paper?
  \r\n\r\nAre there any essential typography books that I should get? The only book
  I have is The elements of typography style by Robert Bringhurst which I had trouble
  understanding it.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions or words of wisdom do not hesitate
  to write. Thanks"

    and words, then once I'm back I can take the best bits and convert into ideas
    for fonts.

    pencil and paper?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, \u2013 *writing*. Which can range from sketching
    to drawing, lettering and calligraphic exercise.\r\nOr, you can carefully observe
    the typographic differences between e.g. two newspapers \u2026 will turn out telling
    you a lot.\r\n\r\nSince you are in Korea I recommend you starting with your country\u2019s
    own typographic culture (which is quite impressive), and later on turn to Latin
    or other type cultures."

    I have tried before to see the difference but it all looked the same to me. I
    guess I gotta keep trying! '
