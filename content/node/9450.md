body: 'Hi <BR>Me &#40;Gilles Pegel&#41; and a friend &#40;Sacha Rein&#41; are setting
  up a simple but yet useful <BR>and informative typographie related homepage and
  forum. <BR>The webpage features a linksection, a meltingpot of works, infos etc.
  The site is still under construction as we don&#39;t have much time cause it&#39;s
  our last year at the ERG &#40;Ecole de Recherche Graphique Brussels&#41; and we
  got lots of other work ;&#41; Like kerning fonts hehe ;&#41; <BR>We are students
  and do this in a NON-commercial aim. Every help is welcome! &#40;like linking to
  our URL&#41; <BR>We are both working on fonts and they will be available in a few
  months maybe less. <BR>If you are a typographer, be sure to contact us so we can
  improve our typographers &amp; foundries section. <BR>We would love to get some
  feedback! Any suggestions, help or comments, from either amateurs or professionals
  are very welcome. Thanks a lot <BR> <BR>Please visit us at: <BR><a href="http://www.trypo.com/"

  body: The bottled one, yes. The poster, no cause his username reveals not much.

  body: What is the goal of your forums? Why start a new forum when  <BR>there is
    Typophile? I mean this as constructively as possible.

  body: Great Website! <BR> <BR>Gilles, Stephen has a very good point above. When
    a few other Offenbach students and I started TypeOff, we thought a lot about including
    a forum section. We didn&#39;t. Even if we wanted to reinvent the wheel, we wouldn&#39;t
    have been able to attract a community as good or as vibrant as the one here at
    Typophile! <BR> <BR>Our second idea was to make a German-language only forum,
    but there were enough German-speaking type forums already &#40;two, to be exact

  body: Hi everyone <BR> <BR>Yeah, we both also thought about why creating a forum
    when there is typophile and some others. But hey we don&#39;t want to recreate
    typophile or any other, it&#39;s just like a little plus to a small webpage where
    we show our fonts. I think it&#39;s nice to have a online blog/forum where we
    can change and experiment things, meet people, get feedback on our fonts and the
    webpage. Even if we won&#39;t hit the 1000 userbar &#40;sure that would be nice&#41;,
    that isn&#39;t our goal, we just want trypo to have it&#39;s own forum. It&#39;s
    easy to update news and stuff and users can interact by replying to topics like
    news or jell at me cause my font needs to be re-spaced;&#41; <BR>We both are from
    Luxembourg studying in Brussels and speaking German, French and English and are
    open for everyone. We set this forum up without worrying to much about when, who
    and where. I just look at it as a small place to discuss anything typerelated.
    There are supermarkets, but still small shops, there is the sea, but people still
    build pools, there is the rainforest but sometimes i take a walk in the park <IMG

    I see it like this. <BR> <BR>Well thanks Lauri, Stephen and Dan for the comments.
    <BR>I really appreciate. <BR>Have a great week! <BR> <BR>Gilles

  body: The more the merrier. I think it is a great idea for you to have a forum on
    your site to discuss your type. The only problem, and maybe it isn&#39;t a problem,
    is that the web is so full. Well, that is how I feel anyway. I&#39;m overloaded
    already and cannot keep up.
