body: FF Strada is a beautiful typeface, but what's the deal with that licensing?
  Offering italics and caps separately? I'd love some suggestions for other similar
  designs.

  body: "<cite>Offering italics and caps separately?</cite>\r\n\r\nAs long as you
    choose the OpenType version, the small caps are not separate. For the PostScript
    format: there was/is no other way, as there are not enough slots.\r\n\r\nFor the
    Italic: It looks like you can license all upright weights in one bundle, and all
    italic weights in another. Of course, you can always assort your desired styles
    as single fonts. So, is it a Regular/Italic/Bold/Bold Italic core package that
    you are missing?"

  body: I overlooked those caps in the OT bundle. Thanks Florian. Yeah, I'm missing
    the core package, but I guess it's not all that bad when caps are present.

    looks like its the preference of the designer, Albert Pinggera.\r\n\r\nThe only
    alternative I can think of\u2014if you don\u2019t mind the (long) wait\u2014is
    Kris Sowersby\u2019s Serrano available for licensing in 2013:\r\nhttp://klim.co.nz/custom_serrano.php\r\n\r\nMike

  body: "Packaging is often based on the release date of various styles and weights.
    Perhaps FF Strada's roman fonts were published as a package before the italic
    weights were complete.\r\n\r\nFlorian is right about the caps in the OT version.
    One of the disadvantages of OpenType is that it can be difficult for customers
    to find (and for vendors to show) everything that's included. We've done our best
    at FontShop to list all the features and display all the associated glyphs in
    OT fonts. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_strada_ot_regular_italic/?sample_text=See%20small%20caps%20below.&acs_ss=15\">Here's
    FF Strada Italic</a>."

  body: 'From a customer perspective, separating italics and uprights is frustrating.  Actually,
    not offering a core bundle (reg, it, bold, bold it) at all seems wierd to me.
    Wouldn''t that just generate more sales? '
