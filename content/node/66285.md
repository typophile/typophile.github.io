  target=\"_blank\">backpacker.gr</a> celebrates 4 years on the road with the release
  of BPimperial; a caps-only condensed typeface in two weights (light and bold), each
  one accompanied by extreme 12 degrees italics. With several letters trying to impose
  on the rest, and a set of unexpected design choices in some of its puncuation marks,
  BPimperial is a display font that literally stands out! Give it a try!\r\n\r\nDon't
  forget to download BPimperial's accompanying pdf. It includes works from a few friends
  that kindly responded to my invitation to try the font and design something (anything)
  with it. Thanks a million to all of you (Christos Tsoleridis + Christos Papatheodorou
  from <a href=\"http://www.togetherdesign.gr\" target=\"_blank\">togetherdesign</a>,
  Giannis Kouroudis from <a href=\"http://www.k2design.gr\" target=\"_blank\">K2design</a>
  and Michail Semoglou from <a href=\"http://www.cannotnot.net\" target=\"_blank\">cannotnot
  design</a> together with Emirihanna Litsa)"
