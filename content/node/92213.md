  body: "I think \"Alice in Wonderland\" works, but with \"Disney\", the actual outlines
    are simply copied and that's really a no-no for that style, since the marks made
    with what appears to be a brush or marker are peculiar to the direction and pressure
    the strokes were written. I think \"walkman\" worked well, as did the japanese
    example. Why? because both styles are not really specific to a script, and are
    playful in themselves. Some of the examples aren't as nice.\r\n\r\nI had seen
    something like this earlier. Some worked, some didn't.\r\nhttp://www.designer-daily.com/hebrew-translations-of-popular-logos-6798\r\n\r\nAnd
    this also came up, with the coke logo:\r\nhttp://www.roundpeg.biz/2010/05/great-logos-transcend-language/\r\n\r\nBear
    in mind, although I do know a little Hebrew, I'm not native and I'm not fluent."

  body: "Some, like the Alice in Wonderland, are transliterations; some, like Walkman
    and the beer label, are translations - the label  includes a translation of 'Brewery\"
    into Hebrew.\r\nThe Japanese one looks good, but I have no idea whether it's a
    transliteration or a translation.\r\n\r\nSome appear to be stylistic interpretations
    which I personally find unreadable.\r\n\r\nSo whether they're quality products
    depends on what the goals were!\r\n\r\n -  Herb\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd assume the purpose of any typographic exercise like this is to generate
    readable well-crafted forms/proportions, with the challenge and limitation of
    maintaining the original's stylistic approach.

  body: "But the style of the original can never be fully reconciled with the needs
    of the other script, so it becomes a complex balance of multiple sensitivities.\r\n\r\nFrom
    Hebrew's sister script (plus a couple of others):\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/sets/72157627127732939/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I would argue that some of those styles are unnatural to both scripts and
    therefore not latinization. Or, do occur in both scripts.
