  or Helvetica without too many gimicks for my magazine. My inspiration has been GQ's
  FB Titling Gothic. I settled on Akzidenz which is a nice font with a broad range,
  but it doesn't have the character of David Berlow's font. I know it's available,
  but I would love to use something that brands us uniquely. I bought and tried FF
  Hydra, but found it letters like the 'R' 'i\" 'g' too showy and lacking range without
  a black or thin weight option. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\u2014
  Keith"
