  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I have made a typeface in illustrator where I have hinted every single letter from sizes 7pt up to 12pt. The typeface is drawn at 100% size in illustrator which means the smallest one is actually only 4pixels high, but the problem is when i copy them into fontlab they become very Very tiny and when i scale them up the shape slightly changes. I&rsquo;ve read through the measurment pages on typophile but i dont get the trick with the units in fontlab.
So what do i have to do to get the right size as it is into fontlab without scaling, 
AND how do i get all these &lsquo;different&rsquo; fonts in one .ttf file?
If you know, consider yourself as a master of the universe</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It sounds like you are thinking that the outlines need to be scaled to proportionate scale in FontLab - meaning a glyph meant to be used at 6pt needs to be half as small as a glyph meant to be used at 12pt. Is that right? If so, you should drop that idea. All font scaling is meant to be done in the program the font is used in. So an H meant for 6pt should have the same height in Fontlab as one that is intended to be used at 72pt. The shapes should be different to be sure! But the number of units high should not.</p>
<p>What UPM are you using anyway?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">no no, the thing is i have drawn the typefaces as they should be in all the sizes, and now all i want to do is to put exactly that into fontlab even if i have to make a single .ttf file for each size, but why cant i just copy it from illustrator and get exactly the same in fontlab i have tried it like this, i opened an existing font pastet the first couple of letters into fontlab, generated the .ttf and installed the font. but then there is no size for this testfont where the letters that i pasted inside look the same as my design in illustrator, there is always some sort of automated hinting involved, at least it looks like that. so basically my question is this: how do i have to configure fontlab to make a 7pt typeface for example? or do i have to do it like the fonts from minifonts, wher you have to write in 12pt in order to get the fontsize comparable to 7pt?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You can&rsquo;t make several different outlines into one outline font. Each outline font can only have one set of outlines per glyph. &ldquo;Hinting&rdquo; is an advanced technique that manipulates that one set of outlines to create different bitmap renderings. However, most of the current applications and operating systems do not use TrueType hinting the way they used to, so it is pretty much impossible to do what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Also, you can&rsquo;t make a font that is optimal at 7 pt on PC &amp; expect it to be optimal on a mac. Or vice versa. You have to learn to convert to pixel size for both platforms. Which means 2 fonts per pixel size.</p>
<p>Adam is right you have not been hinting - not using a font makers jargon anyway. You have been stacking squares in Illustrator. There is a big big difference.</p>
<p>I should let you know since I have spent time trying to do what you are are doing that most people don&rsquo;t spend time doing this because the market for that kind of font is pretty small and maybe going to go away soon. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>There are some good threads that talk about the ins &amp; outs of doing this here. I will look for them &amp; post some links soon.</p>
<p>I should maybe note that you can make a regular outline font &amp; hint it to work at a variety of sizes. You maybe knew about that already but just in case&hellip;</p>
<p>But the thrust of Adams comment is right. It mostly doesn&rsquo;t pay to be screen focused in your font development.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve done the wrong thing mate. You&rsquo;ve drawn squared but vector font in Illustrator. Importing into FontLab won&rsquo;t make it a bitmap font. It will still be vectors and it will look like those squares at bigger sizes as well.</p>
<p>Hinting is actually just a special technique/software algorithm of a font rendering engine, to make each font look as good and readable at small sizes as possible. You can somehow &ldquo;help&rdquo; this program that does hinting (to still preserve your style and readability of the glyphs), but it&rsquo;s not in a way how you did it.</p>

<p>Maybe I am speaking too soon but I think higher screen rez is going to erode the need for this stuff. I could be wrong. Maybe people will get nostalgic or something.</p>
<p>The other factor is that thousand of people thought to themselves ( &amp; keep thinking) &lsquo;I will make a pixel font - it looks easy&rsquo;. Only to find themselves in a technical swamp well beyond what they bargained for. Plus there are all those 1000s of abandoned free bad pixel fonts washing around the net. They are a kind of Typographical flotsam. Now there are some really good ones. But like I said : I don&rsquo;t know how much longer they have before they are rendered quite obscure by the shifting sands of tech. 10 more years?</p>
<p>I came to type on that route so I have sympathy - but it&rsquo;s not a route I can recommend. Better to start of making a nice outline font of maybe a sans or serif text face - and making a real mess of it. You will learn more &amp; be more entertained in the process.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Eggs,</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do i have to do to get the right size as it is into fontlab without scaling,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s possible, but &ldquo;normally&rdquo; you need to scale the type up in your case so the OS can scale them down later&hellip;if that makes sense. The real question is how do you scale them to get the same effect as fonts, as the effect they have as illustration.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to scale, go to FL/FontInfo/Metrics and Dimensions/ and set the em units to the number of pixels in your font, copy the contour into the glyph window and you have now set the em to receive the little letters you made at actual size. When you compose the font at that size in Illustrator, it should be identical.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;more standard&rdquo; process, is to set up FontLab to be an accurate representation of the screen. Assuming use of a 1000 unit em, this means that when the total pixels size of your font is 10, e.g. 7 pixel cap ht. one pixel above that and two below the baseline, the FontLab 1000 em needs to be divided by 10 to give you a 100 unit pixel.</p>
<p>So you go to FL/preferences/glyphwindow/dimensions/GRID STEP, and set that to 100 x and 100 y. Now take one of the characters you drew for a 10 pixel em and scale it until it fits the grid exactly. You should be able to figure this out once, and then all the glyphs will be scaled the same.</p>
<p>Now you have a font that will also give you the same fonts in illustrator by scaling them which will give you more &ldquo;room: to design in FL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AND how do i get all these ’different’ fonts in one .ttf file?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t. TTFs are not so visionary as you. You may see my exercise on this topic at <a href="http://rogerblack.com/blog/screen_fonts_history">http://rogerblack.com/blog/screen_fonts_history</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>Cmmd-comma is supposed to bring you the FL preferences, but it won&rsquo;t do so the first time. You must access it from the pull down menu once, then Cmmd-comma works until the next session.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you very much this link is very interesting, it&rsquo;s just what i need right now. 
Although i allready have done the fonts in fontlab now, (copied from illustrator etc) it is still good to know that there are more than just one way of doing it. 
I am doing a research project on the legibility of screen fonts when it comes to smaller display sizes, i have also made some tests where it turned out that people need much (the numbers arent all out yet) more time to read Verdana and Georgia from screen than they need to read my font, which is good, but i have put together the text for the tests letter by letter in illustrator because there are about 30 ligatures at each size which are meant to increase the kerning quality, and that is exactly where i am stuck right now.</p>
<p>@at alll the other comments: thanks for explaining what hinting is. i am not trying to get a highres font out of my squares, thx i guess i have to work on my terminology before i post another comment here :D no my work is based on small fonts on the web, mainly html
It all sounds very good but do you know if letter combinations are supported in html? is it possible to write a text like i am writing this comment now, using ligatures ?</p>
<p>thanks so much for your help, it is hard to find since &lsquo;learn fontlab fast&rsquo; doesnt seem to exist anymore ;)</p>

<p>This means your testing is flawed. Not because your font can&rsquo;t be better
(in fact I suspect it is) but because it&rsquo;s not believable that you can end up
measuring a very large difference.</p>

<p>do you know of similar fonts? with ligatures especially for screen display? i hope i&rsquo;m not copying someone&rsquo;s work without even knowing about it</p>
<p>@Eben Sorkin: im aware that technology will soon erase the problem with pixelfonts, in fact i ve been reading this article somewhere that said that some japanese scientists are working on a screen with pixels of about 1/10th of the size they have right now, but on the other hand, the new multitouch screens which have been introduced by Microsoft or Lemur are somewhat depending on the &lsquo;big&rsquo; pixels, but of course with higher cpus that shouldnt be a problem in the future, however all this will not happen, like u said, in the next 10 years, which means at least 15 years until this technology is widely used on phones and other things with screens.</p>

I think you are on the right track too - not least because I REALLY like David&rsquo;s model of creating outlines in a size/pixel centric way rather than hinting the bejezus out of a basic outline. I am sure we would all like to see the ligs!</div>

<p>not yet, don&rsquo;t want be too hasty. It&rsquo;s an experiment and there&rsquo;s no real solution yet. But on the other hand, my course is over in september so there will be one until then, hopefully&hellip; ;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure on how ligatures are handled on the web. Is it possible to use them (things like -fi- or -fl- in html?</p>
<p>edit: oh wonder, it is, these things above look like ligatures..or is it just bad kerning?</p>

Unicode support in HTML doesn&rsquo;t extent to fi ff &amp; fl as far as I can see. It could but it sounds like you have bigger plans than that. It web use primary to your plans? If so you could enginner the fonts to form ligatures as the are used - let the top of the f extend over or connect to the i dot - that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Actually I would need to check that too.</p>
