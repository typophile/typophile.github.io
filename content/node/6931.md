  body: My first reaction was &#34;oh, another geohumanist sans&#34;, but the more
    I look at it the more I think it&#39;s worthwhile. I like how you&#39;re not afraid
    to break some conventions, especially since it&#39;s done in such a confident,
    controlled manner. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hanno, <BR> <BR>I like this okay. It&#39;s very sturdy. I like especially
    the boxyness of the &#39;S&#39; and the shaping of the P and R. The &#39;a&#39;
    is nice too. <BR> <BR>A couple of things that I noticed. To my eye the &#39;C&#39;
    doesn&#39;t appear to have enough weight. I think the &#39;J&#39; needs to be
    wider or something. Maybe it shouldn&#39;t go beyond the baseline. The &#39;K&#39;
    looks droopy compared to letters B E F H P and R. Upper arm terminates to low
    on the vertical I think. I like the &#39;Q&#39; but I think the slight angle on
    the tail&#39;s terminus doesn&#39;t fly. I&#39;d leave it horizontal. I&#39;d
    think it&#39;s okay on the &#39;p&#39; if it was angled the other way and on the
    &#39;q&#39; it looks alright. <BR> <BR>I like the rounded square dots a lot. Oh
    yeah. <BR> <BR>The lc &#39;y&#39; just doesn&#39;t do it for me. What about a
    hooked stem like the &#39;g&#39;? Maybe terminate the &#39;v&#39; portion of the
    glyph above the baseline? <BR> <BR>This might be nice in a heavy black weight
    too. <BR> <BR>Keep it up. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Hi Hanno, <BR> <BR>nice work so far. <BR> <BR>But the y doesn&#39;t really
    do it for me either. I find it a bit irritating, especially at text sizes. Its
    vertical descender has an optical tendency to the right &#40;which may be partially
    due to the angled terminal&#41;. Maybe design an alternate version for text sizes
    &#40;and leave the vertical descender to Displays sizes&#41;? <BR> <BR>S and s
    show a slight tendency to tip over to the right. &#40;The S/s is almost always
    the character that&#39;s the most difficult to balance perfectly.&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    s and o look a tiny bit too small &#40;next to the m, for instance&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>The O &#40;and Q and o&#41; <i>might</i> need some optical compensation &#40;rotate
    the bowl a tad counterclockwise?&#41;. Expecially next to the e, the o shows a
    slight tendency to the right. <BR> <BR>The same goes for the D, which looks a
    bit top-heavy. <BR> <BR>The t stem looks a bit heavy. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure
    whether I like the J. Maybe include an alternate version? <BR> <BR>The rounded
    square dots are nice, indeed. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>jpg

  body: Thanks for your comments and suggestions. After staring at these letters all
    by myself for a while now, it&#39;s great to get some new input.  <BR>An alternate
    version of the &#39;y&#39; sounds like a good idea, although I think I&#39;ll
    keep the other one too. It just seemed right to me to draw the y like this, since
    the whole font has such a strong vertical emphasis.  <BR>I&#39;ll keep working
    and will post new stuff soon. <BR> <BR>greetings, <BR>Hanno

  body: Hanno, <BR>Nice even color. Overall, it is quite good.  While I like the Greek
    y, I feel it stops you and gives itself too much attention with its symetry.  The
    R and the P seem to be a bit too wide on top.  Perhaps just a sliver less would
    do it. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: New here eh? Welcome to typophile. <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>It
    just seemed right to me to draw the y like this, since the whole font has such
    a strong vertical emphasis.<!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR>It occurs
    to me that too much agreement between characters in their stress makes long stretches
    of body copy tiring to read. If all characters try to be as vertical as possible,
    you might end up with too consistent a pattern to be scanned quickly. Instead,
    angling the right stroke of the y makes it easier to distinguish for instance
    from the j which is predominantly vertical. Another nice thing about angling the
    stroke of the y is that many english words end in the letter y and so the end
    of the word slants and has a more recognizable shape. <BR> <BR>punctuation - I&#39;m
    liking the rounded square in your punctuation. <BR>B - Need to optically lighten
    where the two strokes of the bowls come together. <BR>G - Looks like it&#39;s
    falling over left. Extend the upper arm. <BR>J - Stroke coming off the top there
    is a bit confusing. It&#39;s having trouble spacing with the I and I have a feeling
    it won&#39;t space well with the other capitals either. If you can come up with
    a good reason to keep it, maybe it should be shortened and lightened some. <BR>N
    - Angled stroke might be too light. <BR>M - I like the shape of this glyph on
    its own but it belongs to some other type. The miter on the two sloped strokes
    is the only pointed join in the capitals. <BR>Q - Maybe it&#39;s caused by the
    angled terminus of the stroke but the tail looks closer to the left side of the
    bowl. Needs some optical compensation. <BR>numerals - I like the four numerals
    you have in the sample paragraph, especially the 1 and 7. Wouldn&#39;t mind seeing
    the rest. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have perfect typeface recall like some of the folks
    here, so I can&#39;t give you names, but this looks very similar to many other
    designs I&#39;ve seen around. Is there some guiding principle that you started
    from to arrive at these shapes? Did you plan how you might arrive at something
    different than what&#39;s out there already? I ask because I spend a good amount
    of time trying to imagine designs that haven&#39;t already been built and I&#39;m
    curious if others do the same and how.

  body: 'hello everybody,  <BR>here&#39;s a new pdf showing some more glyphs and the
    three different weights i&#39;m working on. unfortunately i haven&#39;t been able
    to work on most of the suggestions you made, but i will get to that soon.  <BR>to
    answer aaron&#39;s question: of course i thought about how to create something
    unique. the idea behind tramway was to create a font based more on rounded squares
    than on circles, that has a technical feel to it &#40;that is, I think, what jon
    called &#34;sturdy&#34; and &#34;boxy&#34;&#41;, but that is working in small
    text sizes as well. the boxyness of the basic letterform, the lc &#39;o&#39;,
    is also how came up with the rounded punctuation. <BR>In order to keep the font
    legible i try not to break too many conventions. This is why it doesn&#39;t look
    very unusual when you first look at it.  <BR>I think it&#39;s the details that
    make this font unique: it&#39;s &#34;boxyness&#34;, the emphasis on the vertical
    und some unusual letterforms. <BR> <BR>until then...  <BR>hanno <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: It&#39;s very 21st century. I&#39;m liking it even more now. <BR> <BR>The
    &#34;J&#34; could have a shorter top. The &#34;K&#34; is off. I&#39;d make the
    &#34;M&#34; narrower. <BR>I&#39;d make the lc ascenders taller. The &#34;k&#34;
    is slightly dark in the arms. More body to the &#34;t&#34;. Please don&#39;t &#34;fix&#34;
    the &#34;y&#34;! <BR>The &#34;5&#34; is a bit mannered on top. <BR>Your spacing
    is loose. <BR>I&#39;d make one darker weight too. <BR> <BR>hhp

    target="_blank">Apex Sans</a>, but I think I like yours better. I do think some
    of your numerals look awkward, particularly the 2. Apex uses old style figures,
    which may be one direction you could explore.

  body: 'Nice - like a 21st century Interstate. <BR> <BR>I think you need to ramp
    up the stroke contrast towards the dark end - it looks sort of bloated like this,
    especially in the tight joins, like the bottom of the &#34;b&#34;. <BR> <BR>The
    only lc glyphs that are bothering me are the &#34;k&#34; &#40;too narrow, too
    grot&#41;, and the &#34;r&#34; &#40;too shy&#41;. I do have a &#34;macro&#34;
    suggestion though: add some shears, like at the stem-tops of the &#34;i&#34; and
    &#34;j&#34;, and the bottoms of the &#34;v&#34; and &#34;w&#34;. <BR> <BR>In the
    UC, the &#34;J&#34; is imbalanced, and I might try shearing off the point at the
    bottom of the V of the &#34;M&#34; - it feels too sharp. Also, I&#39;d make the
    head of the &#34;P&#34; larger, relieve the blotting in the tail of the &#34;Q&#34;
    &#40;not sure how&#41; and slighly lighten the bottom-right curve of the &#34;S&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Your hybrid nums are quite nice to me. The &#34;2&#34; seems to need
    a more curvy spine, I&#39;m not sure about the &#34;4&#34;, and the top of the
    &#34;7&#34; seems a bit thick.'
