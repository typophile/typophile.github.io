  body: "<strong>Grinder</strong> by SWFTE International [1986-1995] looks like a
    good match to your sample (see the image bellow) but this is probably a clone
    [not the original font] as SWFTE was a well known font-forgery corporation, so
    please use it with care if you need a license for a commercial project.\r\nAnybody
    who can find the original?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gringer_StCharles_5468.jpg]"
