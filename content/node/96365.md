body: Tired of using nothing but the "symbol" font to do designs for frats and sororities.  Anyone
  know of a nice "fashionable" looking font with greek symbols?  Something close to
  <a href="https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/clan/ultra">Clan Ultra</a>? Also, perhaps
  a distressed version?

    you presumably want a font with Greek \"letters\" (i.e., for text). Many of the
    Slimbach/Adobe families have Greek \u2014 Minion, Arno, Warnock, Garamond Premier
    etc. There are plenty of other good Greek fonts out there as well, many of them
    without matching Latin."
