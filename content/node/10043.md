  &#40;vaguely&#41; in a dark corner between neohumanist sans-serif and blackletter
  frakturs combined with a healthy dose of experimentation. <BR> <BR>Hope you like!

  body: I&#39;m diggin&#39; the idea, and it looks cool... the &#34;s&#34; with the
    full line is killer, but I&#39;m not so sure that the tail on the T is working.  It
    adds an interesting element, but in regular type it gets a little distracting.  Maybe
    keep it as an alternate.  Overall, though, it looks cool.
