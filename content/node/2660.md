    bank cards and my Visa is set in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ocr-b/"

    that looks a bit like simplified <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ocr-a/"

  body: Halter is clearly refrenced from bank card type, but it is not the type used.
    <BR> <BR>My British card infact uses one type for the card number and another
    the the expiry date etc. Any ideas? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23869.jpg"
