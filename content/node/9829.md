  body: Of course there are legal issues, unless you&#39;re using only open-source
    software. It depends on the individual licenses of the software you are planning
    on deploying.

  body: If the software is legally installed on your own computer, I don&#39;t see
    any problem taking it to a freelance site. <BR> <BR>The company&#39;s sys-admins
    might have something to say if you want to hook up the computer to the company&#39;s
    network, but that&#39;s not a legal issue.

  body: If it&#39;s on site, they really should be providing the software. <BR> <BR>Some
    companies, like MM, grant you a dual-install license &#40;work/home or desktop/laptop&#41;.
    Some companies are smart enough to license the software to YOU rather than your
    machine, so you could install it on as many machines as you want provided you
    are the one using the SW. It all depends on the EULA and how much the software
    company trusts you as a customer ;o&#41;

  body: HBM for clarity, this is your software on your laptop? Or, is it the software
    of the company for whom you will be freelancing?
