  at <a href=\"http://www.beyeler.com/fondation/e/html_11sonderaus/01_aktuelle/intro.htm\">Fondation
  Beyeler</a> today and was stunned by these anthropomorphic figures from Papua New
  Guinea alternately called <em>yipwon</em> or <em>aripa</em>.\r\nTheir proportions
  are a bit impractical for the web. :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yipwon_3542.jpg]\r\n\r\nThey're
  fairly large, some almost life-size, some even slightly taller; and the ones I saw
  were between 200 and (probably) close to 500 years old. According to this little
  leaflet I got at the exhibition, these figures were supposed to (spiritually) help
  the hunt; they are embodiments of spiritual beings moving back and forth between
  the spheres of the real and the spiritual, and (this is not in the leaflet) their
  formal execution seems to echo this (non-exclusive) duality by making the \"empty
  space\" just as palpable as the \"real material\", giving equal value to the tangible
  and the imagined. They're thereby also implying impressive volume while in fact
  they're usually fairly two-dimensional (this is in the leaflet again).\r\n\r\nI
  tried to find a book on these, but books on Oceanic Art seem to treat these figures
  rather marginally, and the exhibition catalog was prohibitively expensive. :-|  Does
  anyone know about these? There isn't even a Wikipedia page.\r\n\r\nBy the way, being
  in a museum that usually shows modern art, the exhibition combined these figures
  with Matisse paintings hung in the same room. I couldn't help but feel his modern
  treatment of the white (like here in <a href=\"http://www.passion-estampes.com/deco/affiches/matisse/matissealgueblanche.jpg\">\"Algue
  blanche sur fond rouge et vert\"</a>) feels strangely forced in comparison with
  the gracious whitespace in the yipwon.\r\n\r\nMore yipwon pictures:\r\n(Googling
  for those is\u2026 funny.)\r\n<a href=\"http://www.egodesign.ca/fr/article.php?article_id=342&page=3\">Ego
