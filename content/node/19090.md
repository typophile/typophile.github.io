  body: "This is a tough one. It's mostly a sans serif, but it looks like there are
    serif-like flares at the stroke ends. Having it all-caps doesn't help much either.
    I haven't been able to spot it in the Big Yellow (FontBook), so that suggests
    post-1998, or a relatively obscure foundry.\r\n\r\nI'm stumped so far.\r\n\r\n-
