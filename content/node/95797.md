body: Unfortunately it's a photo of a photocopy, but hope someone can help identify
  this splendid Modern italic from Rome, 1911. Found in the <cite>Catalogo dei punzoni
  e delle matrici orientali e latini</cite> from the Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/italic_4135.jpg]

  body: It is very reminiscent of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/madison-antiqua/pro-italic/glyphs.html|Madison
    Antiqua]], which, according to Jaspert, Berry and Johnson's Encyclopedia, was
    originally called Amts-Antiqua, and issued in 1909 by Stempel. It also says the
    typeface was redesigned in 1965, maybe that's when the descender of the lc f was
    cut off at the baseline etc.
