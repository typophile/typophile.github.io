  release section. however, it seems that section has really turned into a self promotion
  psuedo-spam type of place. I looked through several pages there and couldn't find
  many actual questions like this, so I decided to post here)\r\n\r\nSo, is it possible
  to earn a living being a typographer in 2012?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find some information
  about this, and cant seem to find anything via google.\r\n\r\nHow much does a major
  company like Linotype pay for a font?  I realize of course this will vary. Just
  a range of prices would be nice to know. Do they buy them outright, or do the designers
  get royalties?\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'd be better off setting up my own small font co
  and releasing them myself on the web?\r\n\r\nI'm currently working as a graphic
  designer, but am very curious about the process and possibility of going exclusively
  to typography.\r\n\r\nThanks for all insight."

    midst of a gazillion competitors? If your answer is good I'm sure someone will
    sign you on.
