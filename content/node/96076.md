body: This is a logo for a local Atlanta. It looks to be modified a bit from the existing
  font but I'm having troubling identifying where it originally came from. Any help
  IDing the original font would be much appreciated. Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pars-LG_4487.jpg]

    Sorry about that and again, any help is appreciated. Thanks!
