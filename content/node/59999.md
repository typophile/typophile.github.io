body: "Sorry this is my second post in 2 days on InDesign--but I need to learn some
  intricacies that I've always bypassed before.\r\n\r\nIt seems so simple--type on
  a path. I just want to make a 3 word sentence sit on the curve of a circle. I see
  how to make it do so, but then I can't get rid of the circle without the type deleting
  too.\r\n\r\nWhat's the deal?!"

    upright. It's either on the outside, upright, or on the inside, upside down.\r\n\r\nHelp!"

    to NIL and Zero respectively. But yes, after setting the text on path, if you
    convert your text to outlines, the path will automatically disappear.\r\n\r\nFor
    the second issue, try using two semi circles rather than a complete circle."

    with the selection tool you should be able to click on the type and you will see
    a small line at the centre of the text. Click and drag, and you will be able to
    move the text along the path, and you will also be able to drag the path to the
    inside of the circle. (As satya says, you may need to use two circles, and you
    may need to use baseline shift to adjust the baseline to that the top of the text,
    rather than the base, is on a path.)"
