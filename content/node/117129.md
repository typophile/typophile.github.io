  body: After a bunch of looking I think it is Pompei with a custom R. Just an easy
    edit in Illustrator.

    You can see the P is open, but I think Bob's suggestion is the simplest way.\r\n\r\n-

  body: 'Thanks all. I think this must be a custom weight of pompei as the serifs
    are different in Pompei and Pompei New. '

  body: "I think the main point is that we seem to be in agreement that you could
    create this RNE lettering starting with Pompei and editing it. That means chopping
    off parts of serifs and cutting out part of the bowl of the R. Even adding stroke
    thickness, if necessary. The serifs on your E look like Pompei's E, but with some
    parts cut away. The fact that the N also goes below the baseline in your sample
    adds to the choice of Pompei as the starting point.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
