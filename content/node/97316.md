  body: "I don't find the original question ambiguous. Without further clarification,
    it can be taken to mean: what resources are available for supporting the languages
    of indigenous people on the Web.\r\n\r\nIn the case of North American Indians/People
    of the First Nations, there are the Inuktitut, Cree, and Cherokee syllabaries,
    and some additional Latin letters found in many wide-ranging Unicode fonts.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    some African languages use additional African letters; there's also the Vai syllabary.\r\n\r\nOne
    can go further afield, and, for example, note the existence of fonts for the Yi
    syllabary (a language related to Burmese, used in China)."

    it goes, most of the \"indigenous\" people of the Americas (North & South) don't
    have a written form for their languages. When forced to come up with one, they
    tend to use the Latin alphabet.\r\n\r\nI did a tri-lingual, three-voulme series
    (English, Spanish, and \"Indigenous\") a few years back. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/monwo2.html\r\n\r\nThe
    problems were not matters of typeface, they were organizational. (As the designer/typesetter,
    it became apparent that it was too late to work around certain editorial decisions
    that got in the way of clear presentation.)\r\n\r\nBut if you really mean only
    the characters/glyphs, all that's lacking is somebody willing to do the work.
    And perhaps getting Unicode to recognize the language. Print or pixel, not much
    difference."

    on the wrong foot. Except for Gaelic, these aren't indigenous or minority languages
    - these are languages of major national communities, and have hundreds of fonts.\r\n\r\nRecommending
    the best web fonts for Japanese or Greek or Hebrew is <em>not</em> particularly
    simpler than recommending the best web fonts for <em>English</em>!\r\n\r\nBut
    the <em>good</em> news, though, is that this makes the question simple enough
    for you to answer yourself with a bit of Googling. Although, admittedly, a command
    of the languages in question would make it easier."

  body: "I assume he meant \"native\" as in \"a font native to another language\",
    meaning a font designed first and foremost for users of one particular language,
    whatever other languages it might support.  (Given that the vast majority of fonts
    discussed here are \"native\" to Latin-1 languages, I suppose that implies his
    primary interest is in fonts which aren't.)\r\n\r\nA font that's \"native\" to
    Farsi isn't the same as a font that's \"native\" to Arabic (the language), even
    though they're both classifiable as Arabic (the writing system) fonts.  Alternatively,
    a font that's designed by a Russian speaker primarily for use in writing Cyrillic
    (but happens to contain Latin support as well) may be considered a \"native\"
    Russian font, whereas a Latin font designed by an English speaker that happens
    to contain Cyrillic support may not be.\r\n\r\nUm, that make sense?"
