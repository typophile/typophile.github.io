  body: Whoops, I think Apex sans instead. <BR> <BR>Nope, not Din, not Apex Sans,
    my bad. There are so many fonts that look like this now, I leave it to the other
    experts.

  body: September is still exclusive to Details magazine, so it automatically  <BR>rules
    out that possibility. <BR> <BR>The lowercase &#34;g&#34; is indeed very Hubert
    Jocham-esque.
