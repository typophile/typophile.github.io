  body: "Casady & Greene were among the first, possibly THE first to create digitized
    personal computer fonts, with their FLF (Fluent Laser Fonts) collection. It appears
    that when they went out of business they didn't give or sell their rights to any
    successor person or organization.  With one or two exceptions, Richard Ware publicly
    announced that his fonts (those with his name in the copyright field) would henceforth
    be free. Unfortunately, I don't recall, and at the moment can't find, exactly
    which font(s) stayed commercial.  I know that Typoasis at one point had all of
    his fonts freely available, but at his request they removed one. He is since deceased
    (prior to 2008). There is one very un-detailed google-able comment that his estate
    may be or have been involved in a font copyright dispute.\r\n\r\n  HVB"
