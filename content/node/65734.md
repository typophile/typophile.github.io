  a brother in the business). It seems like a really valuable read. I'd like to recommend
  it to beginners because of the original drawings, which I found very revealing,
  but I imagine the price and the more technical aspects might be a bit much. Perhaps
  a good addition to a college library.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    bite on my wallet, I got it used, 1/3 off. \r\n\r\nA tremendous amount of work
    has gone into it, and it was obviously a labor of love for all those involved.
    It combines copious illustration and extensive interviews with Frutiger on each
    typeface, keyed to the illustrations. Though often enough I question Frutiger's
    theories, I am learning a lot and loving it. \r\n\r\nI suspect you have to really
    be serious about type to enjoy this, but if you are it's a joy to read.\r\n\r\nIt
    has to be one of the best books on type design, ever."

  body: "I'm up to the chapter on Frutiger, the typeface. Some gossip the type-crazed
    might be interested in: \r\n\r\nFrutiger was the third version of the same typeface
    idea. \r\n\r\nThe first Concorde, never produced, came from a \"whiskey sketch\".
    When things got too hectic there was a bottle of whiskey that everyone would turn
    to to loosen up. After such a session, Frutiger drew the top terminal of a 'c',
    and explained to Andr\xE9 G\xFCrtler how the idea could be expanded into a typeface,
    and G\xFCrtler writes \"something wonderful happened, an energetic current ran
    through me.\" Frutiger gives G\xFCrtler credit as a co-creator on Concorde. \r\n\r\nThe
    second was Roissy, which Frutiger simplified and adjusted the weight of, as it
    was for airport signage. When Mike Parker saw it, he immediately saw that it would
    make a great face for print. \r\n\r\nFrutiger was so busy that he had Hans-J\xFCrg
    Hunziker draw it. Frutiger says that Hunziker, who had spent four years at Merganthaler
    Linotype in Brooklyn, is \"an unbelievably good draughtsman.\" He gives credit
    to Hunziker for the \"high contrast terminals ...closer to an antiqua.\" These
    really give a shimmering beauty to Frutiger in large sizes, and though Frutiger
    only credits himself on this one, I'm glad that Hunziker's role is acknowledged,
    as I've long admired those special terminals. \r\n\r\nMike Parker named it \"Frutiger\"
    because he thought it would be more difficult to pirate if it had someone's proper
    name. In retrospect, ha ha ha!\r\n\r\nHere's Frutiger on Myriad, which has been
    often discussed here on Typophile. Frutiger thought, \"My typeface has gained
    a little cousin--and it's not badly done either.\" A fellow from Linotype then
    sent Frutiger side by side comparison, and then Frutiger was a bit miffed that
    Adobe had done such a similar typeface, because Adobe had just been digitizing
    Linotype's faces. But later he returned to his initial reaction: \"Why shouldn't
    a good typeface be developed further by a third party? When I see today that someone
    has taken my thoughts and developed them further, I'm even proud of that.\" \r\n\r\nThe
    comments on Frutiger Next are revealing in that Frutiger basically rips it. He
    thinks that it is more appropriate for the face to have a sloped roman, not italic
    characters. And he doesn't think the interpolated weights look as good as the
    original drawn ones. \r\n\r\nNot in this book is the new [[http://www.linotype.com/5940/introduction.html|Neue
    Frutiger]], which I imagine he is very happy with. Here he worked with Akira Kobayashi
    to correct the distortions due to the Linotype phototype restrictions to 18 widths,
    as explained last summer by Kobayashi in a lovely talk at TypeCon. And the sloped
    roman is back, as are the original proportions. I hope the issues of interpolation
    are also addressed, though I don't know. \r\n\r\nAt any rate, I think it's great
    that he had a fourth bite at this apple, as he confesses it's his favorite of
    his typefaces: \"It's probably the typeface that holds the middle ground of the
    type landscape. It's like a nail that's been driven, and on which you can hang
    everything. ...as typeface that really is beautiful, one that sings.\"\r\n\r\nHappy
    New Year Mr. Frutiger! "

    features in other letters. Understanding those implications and either applying

    letter and <em>gestaltning</em> is the same as the German <em>Gestaltung</em>
    which in this context would refer to design I assume. Published in Sweden 1967,
    64 pages and could be (I'm still waiting for it) really interesting, although
    not as all-encompassing as <em>the Complete works</em>, obviously.

    add, since I've been mainly rhapsodizing about Frutiger, that in my eyes a lot
