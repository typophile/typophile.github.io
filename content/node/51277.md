body: Hey guys, I have done several logos throughout the years for various size business
  where people requested the TM mark on the logo. I have also seen the mark on many
  other logos of both small and large companies. I was wondering what is the actual
  legality of this mark? Can you just seemingly throw it on the end of a logo and
  it hold some real meaning? Should I refuse to use it just because of a client request.
  I'm sure some of you guys really know what you are talking about and I would love
  to hear it from you all.

    sure some of you guys really know what you are talking about  \r\n\r\nThe value
    of the advice given here (legal or otherwise) certainly exceeds the price you
    paid for it. "

  body: Thanks sii, I was wondering also if we as designers have a responsibility
    to include such marks mentioned. Anyone have a take or experience on this?

  body: "Jeremiah&#8212;to the best of my knowledge and experience working at branding
    and branding communications&#8212;no legal requirement exists for a logo or any
    form of branding to use the TM mark provided the owner of the brand / logo makes
    use of it to identify their products / services / business / trade. The TM mark
    amounts to an assertion of the branding / logo as the brand used in trade by its
    owner. As noted on a similar recent thread, the only legal stipulation is that
    the owner use the brand on their stuff and engage in trade with that stuff and
    a customer or two.\r\n\r\nBy contrast (R) or \xAE cannot be used unless the brand
    owner has registered their logo(s) and branding with the trademark /patents office.\r\n\r\nDesigners
    may include the TM mark if they want to, as a nod to professionalism, either by
    request of the commissioning client, or voluntarily, but there's no responsibility
    for designers to do so per se. It's optional.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    tab\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between TM and the R within the circle \xAE?\r\n\r\nUse
    of the TM and SM symbols may be governed by local, state, or foreign laws and
    the laws of a pertinent jurisdiction to identify the marks that a party claims
    rights to. The federal registration symbol, the R enclosed within a circle, may
    be used once the mark is actually registered in the USPTO. Even though an application
    is pending, the registration symbol may not be used before the mark has actually
    become registered. \r\n\r\nThe federal registration symbol should only be used
    on goods or services that are the subject of the federal trademark registration.
    \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Several foreign countries use the letter R enclosed within
    a circle to indicate that a mark is registered in that country. Use of the symbol
    by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.\r\n"

  body: "I only include it if I'm asked. The less going on the better in a logo most
    of the time. It also frequently becomes a blob when produced small.\r\n\r\nI have
    also had to attach it to a performers name. That was grotesque since of course
    there was a war about how big it should be.\r\n\r\nI have also attached it to
    the phrase \"One Night Only\" believe it or not. That had me almost rolling on
    the floor. As if something like that should be allowed to be trademarked. You
    can trademark a phrase like this within a certain industry, which now that I think
    of it should become an industry all to itself, sort of like hoarding URL names.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if God\u2122 would be enforceable? Or the\u2122?\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\nAll

  body: "I find such gaudy attempts at showing you own the logo to be disgusting.\r\n\r\nIf
    there is any doubt as to the owner of a mark or brand, then it's the fault of
    the logo itself for not communicating effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me, I think
    these things, especially with the use taglines that are trademarked should be
    so effective that everybody inherently <em>knows</em> who they belong to, and
    it's often smaller or immature business owners that have such a greed for their
    property.\r\n\r\nImagine if these things were spoken in the same voice that the
    text is set in.\r\n\r\nWelcome to First Baptist Church. we own that logo.  Come
    on in t find Spiritual Healing, which is our own trademarked phrase, as well as
    find God, we own rights on him too.\r\n\r\nThat would just be silly.  I would
    ask any client who wants/demands any mark like that this:\r\n\r\nI am the designer,
    and before I allow any design element into the logo I have to have a rationale
    for it being there.  Can you provide me with an adequate rationale on why this
    element needs to be added, and how this will help you achieve the strategy we
    decided on at the beginning of the project?\r\n\r\nOr alternatively:\r\n\r\nWho
    is the undisputed leader in their industry.  What does their branding look like?
    \ Do companies who make it to the top have such displays?  Do they rely on such
    attempts to let people know their branding."
