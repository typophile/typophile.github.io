  font.\r\n\r\nAnyone know?"

    you want Sans-Fonts with this upright italic e, have a look at <a href=\"http://bt.gd/1wK\">this
    list</a> which starts at Anivers. "

    came up with Anivers too, but that's not exactly the e I was looking for.\r\n\r\nI
    know Adidas (I think sometime last year, or two years ago) used it for their temporary
    promo typo, so it wouldn't be as custom-made as we think it is..\r\n\r\nJust another
    argument.. :)"
