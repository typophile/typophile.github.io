  to following on from Kent's Ordinal Numbers in Various Languages post in Feb 2008.
  \ I am presently working on a book, which is essentially about a ancient sheep counting
  score (base 20) used throughout the North of Endland up until around the 1850s.
  \ It is not heard today.\r\n\r\nIt goes something like this\r\n\r\n1  YAN\r\n2  TYAN\r\n3
  \ TETHERA\r\n4  METHERA\r\n5  PIMP\r\n6  SETHERA\r\n7  LETHERA\r\n8  HOVERA\r\n9
  \ DOVERA\r\n10  DICK\r\n11  YAN-A-DICK\r\n12  TYAN-A-DICK\r\n13  TETHERA-DICK\r\n14
  \ METHERA-DICK\r\n15  BUMFITT\r\n16  YAN-A-BUM\r\n17  TYAN-A-BUM\r\n18  TETHERA-BUM\r\n19
  \ METHERA-BUM\r\n20 GIGGIT\r\n\r\nI have already done a lot of research on and off
  the web, but what really interests me is the similarities of these numbers to other
  languages across the world.  It appears obvious to me that there is a mix of both
  cardinal and ordinal numbers here.  Also any other comments would be appreciated.\r\nEnjoy!\r\nregards
  Richard"

    a few years ago, IIRC.\r\n\r\nTypography had its own idiosyncratic math system
    (minikin, brilliant, diamond, &c.) but that didn\u2019t utilize prosody mnemonically
    (e.g. rhyming), unless one considers the bizarre nature of the names and their
    contrast with one another to be an aid to memory."

    \ Did they not know numbers in any other language[s], ('one,' 'deux,' etc.), or
    were they simply using these words only when counting something?\r\n\r\nLove how
    dangerously close some of these word pairings are to cuss words--so pimp."

    in folk music and fairy tales, perhaps?

    Pratchett's Discworld books. From the context I was able to grok its meaning :-)\r\n\r\n(Also
    from context: They seem to be quite foulmouthed in jenneral, I didn't dare to
    look up if anything of it was actually an existing language!)"

  body: "Yes, to Gaelic, but properly one should say to Brythonic, of which Gaelic
    is just one modern subdivision.\r\n\r\nThe point of the system is that it is made
    up of sequences of rhyming and rhythmic words, so it is less easy to lose count
    than if one is trying to keep numbers in one's head."

    thick as peat, one I think the Hogwarts Depute would ken on the spot.
