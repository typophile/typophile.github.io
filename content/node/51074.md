  Do you think this logo started out as Pistilli Roman? The W seems to look like Pistilli
  but in italic. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stw_5832.jpg]"

    film type source, but the outlines in the Cabernet digitization seem to match
    precisely, if not just a tad thinner (easily altered with a stroke).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FirefoxScreenSnapz004_3898.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FirefoxScreenSnapz005_3597.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FirefoxScreenSnapz006_4772.png]"

    access a decent digital version of Pistilli Roman? \r\nShould I launch a letter-writing
    campaign? Push for a voter referendum? Maybe Barack Obama can address this travesty
    when he takes office. "

  body: "Didoni and Sahara are both appealing, but the contrast between thick and
    thin isn't right -- the super-thin strokes is what made Pistilli Roman so cool,
    IMO, and what made it look great at big sizes.\r\nI'll keep hoping that someone
    will digitize it someday -- I know people would buy it."

    Glamour magazine years ago when Henry Connell was the art director. I know Dave
    Farey has done a digitization of it as well. At the San Francisco TypeCon, Dave
    and I compared our versions, and damn if they didn't look like the same face!
    No plans of any release. \r\n\r\nIt is a really difficult design to space properly.
    Unless of course if you want to smash all the letters together like they did in
    the 70s.\r\n\r\nJames"
