  tried contacting design companies who have printed brochures for us but as we supplied
  the logo as a jpeg they are unable to and the person who designed it no longer works
  for the design company we used and they are unab;e to find any of his notes (very
  professional).\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    or being able to recognize specific letters, there's no way to be sure this is
    even a font. Did they use this lettering for anything besides the logo? If not,
    your odds of this being a font go down even further.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
