  body: ">This is about half of a good idea.\r\n\r\nHa. I would have liked the styles
    to be more contiguous; there's quite a difference between the quick and the regular.
    But it's an interesting design concept.\r\n\r\nThe lighter weights strongly remind
    me of Susan Kare's 1984(?) Mac font Los Angeles, though Instant is much cleaner
    and more useable. I wonder if that was an intentional influence."
