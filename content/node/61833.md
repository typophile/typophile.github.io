  body: I would suggest finding a good, local, knowledgeable graphic designer and
    paying them an appropriate sum. If times are hard and your budget is stretched
    invite them along to the wedding.

  body: 'Thank you for your feedback and assistance. I''m happy to pay being local
    or overseas, its just finding some one creative. I have used local designers but
    finding the right one that works with your style is difficult. I have used locals
    before for logo''s but we end up spending so much time in design and I end up
    coming up with it and ave to pay $500. If any one has suggestions that who would
    be good to use that will be great, if they have samples then that would assist
    with styles. thanks again for support. '

  body: Like any other business, hiring someone without references or a good portfolio
    involves a risk. I can recommend <a href="http://www.sudtipos.com/home">this guy</a>!
