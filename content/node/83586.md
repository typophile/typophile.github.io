  read through this description several times and can't quite get a handle on it's
  application and usage. It appears that with each Character Variant, a selection
  of glyphs can be accessed to replace one glyph or group of associated glyphs say
  cap A's. Is anyone using this feature and does any software currently support it.

    Fonts spec]] and there's an example showing it's use in a font designed to support
    glyphs found on Byzantine seals.
