  body: Hmmm... I know there were a few Calgary typophiles that I saw down in Seattle
    this summer. There must be a few Veer people kicking around here. I wouldn't really
    know as I don't really know a lot of people yet here in Calgary.

    of that side of the bar.  ;-)  So long as you pick up your own tab (or, even better,
    pick up mine too!), we'd love to have you.\r\n\r\nWe had 10 last time, Tamye:
    it's my understanding that one of our gang, who teaches at the local art college,
    is going to promote this to his students, so all bets are off as to how many will
    show up on Wednesday."

    been away from Calgary, so I'm late posting the announcement. Thanks, Linda, for
    starting the thread.\r\n\r\nAnybody with an interest in type or typography is
    welcome. Our meetings aren't very structured. Mostly just like-minded folk enjoying
    a beverage, some food, and type-geek conversation (wherever that leads).\r\n\r\nThere
    is a potential to make the meetings more structured and promote the type community
    in Calgary, but I don't think we're at that point yet. We only started these things
    this summer so we've got some growing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers, Ken"

  body: "<strong>A Summary of Events:</strong>\r\n\r\nSteve showed up (hi Steve).
    New guy Jordan showed up as well. Lex rescheduled his movie project and made it
    out. Chuck and his students didn't arrive, but we still had \"all the fun\" even
    though the mini-van wasn't needed. Tamye was there in spirit. Veer was absent.\r\n\r\nAfter
    three months of discussion, we've decided not to give ourselves a name. Rather,
    we'll change names and logos on a rotating basis. We could be \"Calgary Typos\"
    one month, \"Calgary Typostammtisch\" another month, or \"Calgary Typographic
    Society\" some other time. We sort of like the C T S letter combination and we
    don't want to be tied down with details.\r\n\r\nJanine, our \"idea-girl\", has
    proposed our first project. (Janine is a virtual fountain of ideas.) We're all
    to take photos of type found within a city block in Calgary (maybe the block around
    our house or the city block where we work). Then we'll assemble all these and
    post them. It'll be wonderful and might evolve into a gallery show. Then maybe
    we'll come to <em>your</em> city and photograph <em>your</em> type. Just wait.\r\n\r\nThe
    Show & Tell is still very popular. Linda and Derek contributed pieces (which had
    to be hastily removed from the table when the food arrived). (As an aside, the
    Kensington Pub offers a choice of two side dishes with each entree: don't order
    potatoes and fries together, you'll never finish them!!)\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely
    evening of relaxed type-geek conversation."

    (except for Derek, who was double-booked, and me, as I was behind the camera)
    -- if you're one of my Flickr friends, it's now available for viewing on my photostream.
    \r\n\r\nIf you're on Flickr but not a friend, let me know and I'll add you.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you're not on Flickr, you're SOL....  ;-) "
