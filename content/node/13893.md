  body: "i'm slightly perturbed by that; it strikes me as rather odd that 'image consultants'
    are, well, being consulted to identify a more 'contemporary' alternative to the
    dash between numbers. if it's purely down to readability issues then fair enough
    - ie deciding what combination is easiest to read from when dialling a phone -
    but i find numbers separated with dots are not <em>that</em> easy to read quickly.\r\n\r\n01234567890\r\n\r\n012.3456.7890\r\n\r\n012-3456-7890\r\n\r\n020
    3456 7890\r\n\r\ni find the bottom two versions most readable, but the last preferable
    - guess that's what i'm used to in the uk. the others seem unnecessarily...superfluous?"

  body: "I have to agree that numbers separated by a space into groups of three or
    four are easier to read and memorise, the line about dashes connecting numbers
    while dots separate seems self-defeating, especially given the example posted
    above. But as Mbusher says cultural conditioning may have something to do with
    this. But which European countries use dots to separate numbers? As far as I can
    remember France, Spain, Germany use groups of numbers either in pairs or threes
    or fours.\r\nTim"

  body: Quite. I handle MSS from authors all over the place (UK & Europe, US & Canada,
    Asia, Far East, you name it) and I don't think I've seen many come in the authors'
    phone numbers split with dots. They would, indeed, look like an IP address and
    would be very odd. Most just use spaces, quite a few use hyphens, and a few, nothing
    at all. I agree that 'no separators' makes for a hard-to-read number; spaces and
    hyphens both look fine to me.

  body: "Reviving this old thread! I've searched as much as I can to find an answer,
    and this thread is as close as I've come.\r\n\r\nWhat do y'all think about using
    en dashes instead of hyphens in phone numbers?\r\n\r\nI've used them in the publication
    I'm working on, but have been told that it is incorrect, and I ought to use hyphens.
    I'm aware that en-dashed telephone numbers are not the norm in Canada (prolly
    not anywhere), but are they wrong? \r\n\r\nThe font I'm using has slightly slanted
    hyphens which I think look utterly silly in the phone numbers. I'd opt for periods
    or spaces, but that's likely too \"designy\" for their taste (their word, not
    mine).\r\n\r\nSo just wondering if there's some rule that I haven't found which
    states that the use of en dashes in phone numbers will cause the sky to fall.\r\n\r\nThanks!
    \r\nK."

  body: "It depends on how the en dash looks in the font. Generally, the en dash is
    used to indicate a range  of numbers, rather than as a separator. In the US the
    normal format for noting a phone number is \r\n\r\n(412)555-5555\r\n\r\nbut I've
    seen it frequently in recent years printed with dots or spaces replacing both
    the parentheses and hyphen. You could use en dashes if you want to, I guess, for
    display so long as it looks good. You just might raise editorial hackles should
    you try it in text."

  body: "As far as I'm concerned, contextuality is everything.\r\nLay readers don't
    react to the qualities of type on a mico-intrinsic level -- they don't notice
    that stuff -- they read in context of the page, of the document.\r\nEditors and
    design professionals and others with a standards axe to grind will assert their
    personal or professional preferences, but it's quite alright for designers to
    make up their own rules for a document. If the design is forced, well then, it's
    too designy -- but if it works, it's brilliant.\r\nAfter all, how did Ladislav
    Sutnar ever come up with the idea of using parentheses to format area codes? "

  body: "I use spaces instead of dashes unless specified otherwise by the client.
    \r\n\r\nIt's also customary here in the US to put the area code (first 3 digits)
    in parens:\r\n\r\n(012) 345 6789\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n(012) 345-6789\r\n\r\nbut I
    usually do away with the parens too - again unless the client insists."

  body: En dash is probably too wide. If you want to avoid the slanted hyphen, either
    substitute a different font for the hyphen or compress the en dash glyph to make
    it narrower.

  body: "I agree that the en-dash is probably too wide, and will call too much attention
    to itself.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the parens for area codes, I suspect it is going
    away as more and more places require you to dial all 10 numbers, even locally. "

  body: "OK. Thanks for the feedback. We're also in the process of changing how we
    deal with area codes since it is now required when dialling locally. Some want
    a dash there, too: 123-234-5678\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll try the dots, or playing around
    with another hyphen. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
