  body: <i>&#62; And what competition, Yves?</i> <BR> <BR>Well, that&#39;s a three-minuter
    if I ever saw one, Eduardo. ;&#41; <BR>It appears you&#39;re on a roll. I barely
    had the time to blink.

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if I understand correctly what you are saying, but we&#39;ve

  body: You understood perfectly well, Eduardo, and there&#39;s not  <BR><i>that</i>
    many IDs that go under 3 minutes, believe me. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Should we keep stats
    on these, just for fun? Or does that  <BR>make it too competitive?
