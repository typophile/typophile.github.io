  not quite Phosphate/Phosphor, it's not quite Gill Ultra Bold, but it seems so familiar.
  Anyone? Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nAs an aside,if you go to the [[http://www.baramericain.com|website,]]
  his other restaurants all have similar logos but with slightly different typefaces.
  It's throwing me for a loop.\r\n"

    the friend who asked me about it just said he was actually going for [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=court+st+brooklyn&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=55.279921,68.291016&ie=UTF8&ll=40.691898,-73.991289&spn=0.026162,0.033345&z=15&iwloc=addr&layer=c&cbll=40.691989,-73.991259&panoid=qbE5zrXowgQYRIA6WG7okQ&cbp=12,281.17315155309416,,0,5|this
