  body: "Ahum, well, there is a freefont named <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/island-of-misfit-to.font?nb_ppp=50&af=on&text=Black+Silver+Fly\">Island
    of Misfit Toys</a> by Steve Ferrera which is awfully close. I don't know if this
    is a \"revival\" or just made a full typeset out of a handlettered sign. \r\n\r\nThe
    title reminds me of the movie \"Rudolph the rednosed reindeer 2\" which I saw
    recently with my kids :-D\r\n\r\nEDIT: As I discovered now, it IS \"based on Rudolph
    the Red Nosed Reindeer Title\" as Steve Ferrera says.  "
