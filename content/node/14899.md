    but the letters are a little too square???

  body: "Kyle,\r\n\r\nI did some searches and I wasn't able to locate the font or
    a vector logo.  But it seems that if you're a member of NewsCom you can download
    a high-res version of it, but it seems to be a hassle to become a member and you'll
    have to pay for it too.  If it's of any help to you, <a href=\"http://prn.newscom.com/cgi-bin/pub/s?f=PRN/prnpub&p1=20040722/DHILOGO&xtag=PRN-prnphotos-48027&redir=preview&tr=1&row=1\"

  body: "If I need to use a logo that I don't have for a presentation or similar (or
    even for artwork when the client swears that a vector version doesn't exist),
    I do a Google search for pdf on the site, download it and open it either in Illustrator
    or Photoshop. Obviously not ideal (and not always successful) but normally acceptable
    for a presentation.\r\nTim"
