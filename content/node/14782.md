body: "Hello everyone, I'm new here. I am a type teacher turned graphic designer,
  living and working in Atlanta. I am also actively involved in the Cybernetic Broadcasting
  System (if anyone else is there). I have been a type freak since the 20th century,
  and this request is a final attempt to save... um... face. Okay, bad pun, :P though
  some help really is needed here. \r\n\r\nI have come here to seek font identification
  as a last resort. This one really has me stumped. It came from a photographer's
  self-promo piece, is a sans-serif, and it looks European. The squarish O and Q make
  it resemble a FontShop typeface. The Q and the ampersand are the most distinct letters,
  the Q having a long and almost, but not quite, horizontal tail, whereas the ampersand
  is broken and does not quite match -- it looks a bit funny. \r\n\r\nIt appears to
  be all small caps, as you can see by comparing the numbers. So it was probably made
  by someone who knows what they're doing. The Q and the ampersand may be alternate
  characters, this is also a possibility. Other distinctions are the wobbly, pinched
  shape of the C and G and the apex of the M coming close to the baseline, but not
  touching it. The type also has a somewhat extended appearance, seen in the R and
  B.  \r\n\r\nIt has some similarities with these, but is none of them:\r\nURW Grotesk\r\nCharlotte

  Projekt\r\nScene\r\nStone Sans\r\nThurdis Sans\r\nUnit\r\nUnivers\r\nZwo\r\n\r\nOnline
  font identification has been useless, so it must be some sort of gourmet font or
  is perhaps very new. If it can be identified, we will probably buy it, and everyone
  here knows how much fun new type is. So please help. Thanks, and good luck.\r\n"

  body: "Well spotted, Dave.\r\n\r\nMust have been blown up from a very small sample,
    as all of the hard corners became round corners. Which I like. It also makes it
    tough for me to identify, but it does appear to be Medium Small Caps and Book
    Small Caps with the Oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\nHrant, here's a Republican apology:
    I'm sorry if you don't like the ampersand. ;-)\r\nThe Italic has a very different
    ampersand; I'm curious to know what you think of it."
