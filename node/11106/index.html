		<div class="commentbody"> Jared: <BR> <BR>Since the subject of passwords has been brought up, I haven&#39;t been able to use my account since I first signed up for it many months ago. The password that I thought I used when the account was created doesn&#39;t work, and the system won&#39;t let me make a new account with the same name or e-mail address. I sent an e-mail shortly afterward, but any reply never made it to me. <BR> <BR>Can anything be done? I&#39;ve been getting along without trouble by manually entering my name and e-mail address on my posts, but it would be nice to have access to all of the functionality of an account. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>David &#40;lost soul&#41; Thometz ;&#41; </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> In both IE 5.1 and Netscape 4.7x on my Mac the discussion pages are almost always far, far too wide. I have to scroll right to read long lines of text that don&#39;t have any line breaks in them, and the limit on just how wide these pages can get seems to be infinite. In this PARTICULAR thread the page works fine - as if the frame it is in has a set pixel limit, but many other threads here don&#39;t seem to have any page/column width limit. Surely this can be fixed pretty simply by tweaking the templates. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Manual line-breaking is indeed a form of art. <BR>But note this: it reaches true nirvana only <BR>when one adapts the actual content to <BR>create a pleasant block of text. <BR> <BR>Furthermore: a good paragraph is neither a <BR>roller-coaster ride with huge gaps and juts, <BR>nor is it a military tribunal with completely <BR>straight sides; it is a pragmatic, human thing <BR>that is neither frantic nor frigid. The Ancient <BR>Greeks knew this; in comparison, the Romans <BR>were juvenile. <BR> <BR>My maxim for the ASCII age is this: Write for the rag. <BR> <BR>But the reason I refuse to do it on Typophile is simple: the typing window uses the predictable, monospaced Courier, but the end-result uses a proportional font - this makes the creation of nice text blocks much too laborious. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> By the way, I think I owe Jared an apology. <BR> <BR>On re-reading my previous post, it could be construed that I was complaining about a lack of assistance with my account and password. In truth, I sent only one e-mail regarding the problem, several months ago, and it was a secondary mention within a message about another topic. I didn&#39;t bother following up because I was getting along just fine on the boards entering my name and e-mail address manually with each post. <BR> <BR>It was only with the creation of this thread that I thought to ask about it again. As you can see, Jared fixed the problem for me immediately, for which I am grateful. <BR> <BR>My previous post was somewhat careless, and while Jared made no indication of taking offense, I wanted to clear the air anyway. <BR> <BR>Jared and Joe run a great organization, and I for one really appreciate their efforts. <BR> <BR>David &#40;who once was lost, but now is found&#41; Thometz <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> </div>
