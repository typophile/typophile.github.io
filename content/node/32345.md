  frim that specilizes in planning and urban design. I'm interested in a [[humanist]]
  font that's classic, clean, and sturdy enough to be a workmark at different scales
  - what's your favorite?\r\n\r\nMany Thanks"

  body: "Usually, humanist does come up in connection with sans-serifs, but it's not
    so unusual to hear about humanist slab-serifs. Other than PMN Caecilia, the humanist
    slabs off the top of my head are <a href=http://www.lucasfonts.com/index_neu.html>TheSerif</a>,
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/chaparral/>Chaparral</a>, and the
    brand new <a href=http://www.linotype.com/3273/soho.html?PHPSESSID=34e1c19945b7c8e50a9d4660378eb6fc>Soho</a>.
    I also can't resist throwing in <a href=http://pampatype.com/php/English/Tipografias_RR.php?secc=cara&menu=menu_T_C.html&sub1=sub1_T_RR_C.html&sub2=sub2_T_R_C.html&pag=pag_T_RR_C.html>Rayuela</a>,
    which, though not really a slab-serif, does have a distinct humanist quality,
    greater than that of most non-script typefaces.\r\n\r\nHope these non-sans typefaces
    could be useful alternatives; I don't mean to hijack the thread. To atone, here's
    a thread purporting to offer a list of the best humanists sans-serifs: http://typophile.com/node/13281
    . Check the list at the very bottom."

    I have the same thought pattern I think.

  body: "<em>Am I normal?</em>\r\ni doubt it. there's no such thing as \"normal.\"\r\n\r\nmaybe
    i have it all wrong, but to me , the term <em>[[humanist]]</em> refers to letters
    that are influenced by [[ductal logic]], whether they're [[sans serif|sans]] or
    [[serif|serifed type]].\r\nin [[calligraphy]], the [[humanist minuscule]] is a
    descendant of the [[carolingian minuscule]]. The humanist model of calligraphy
    is what influenced the earliest [[Roman]] ([[whiteletter]]) types, particularly
    those of [[Nicholas Jenson]]. The [[Vox-ATypI classification]] system uses the
    term humanist to refer to the [[Venetian]] model of type."

  body: Doesn't sound wrong to me, Paul. But I rarely see "humanist" bandied about
    in regard to serifs (with the exception of typefaces inspired by Italian Renaissance
    type), maybe because many more serifs are "humanist" by your ductal-logic definition
    than are sans- and slab-serifs. I'd guess that this comes from the early slab-serifs
    and sans-serifs not being too concerned with ductus as far as I know until Johnston
    and Gill in the early 20th c. and Frutiger in 1968. So to say "humanist" doesn't
    separate a group out as much for serifs as it does for other type genres.
