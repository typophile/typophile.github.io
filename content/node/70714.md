body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI have been trying to identify this font for the past month
  or so, but I can't remember where I grabbed the original screen-shot from. All I
  remember is that it was from a British site (maybe?), and that the designer had
  other similar typefaces, and logos that he had created using the same fonts.\r\n\r\nAny
  help will be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4702.jpg]"
