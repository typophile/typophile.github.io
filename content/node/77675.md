  body: Very good! It's especially consistent, with Latin, Greek and Cyrillic sharing
    a common design but keeping their nuances.

  body: "I'm interested by the greater length of descenders than ascenders.\r\nWhat
    is your thinking behind this, in all three scripts?\r\n\r\nAlso, I find the ear
    of the Latin \"g\" to be idiosyncratic (nothing wrong with that!) -- what would
    you consider to be correspondingly idiosyncratic glyphs in the other two scripts?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hi Nick,\r\nascenders and descenders have equal lengths except of -t-, -&phi;-
    -&psi;- and -\u0444-. it can be idiosyncratic thing, like straight tail of -\u0431-
    or connections of diagonals and main stem in -\u0438- "
