  have to put an overlay that simulates a LCD pattern (pixels), so I need a font with

    small areas</blockquote>\r\n\r\nActually narrowness doesn't always lead to economy.
    If the text has a lot of linebreaks a wide font can be set smaller, saving <em>vertical</em>
    space without wasting horizontal economy -an average of half a line- every time
    a linebreak happens.\r\n\r\nAlso, it depends on the point size.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    say it, why assume it? Ask him what the budget is - that's a big determinant in
    terms of narrowing a search.\r\n\r\nBTW for somebody who wants to fight the perception
    that fonts should be free it's worth \"training\" a boss by avoiding a free font
    even if it does the job. You're not the one with the budget - it doesn't hurt
    to try your luck! One day you might discover a non-free font you really want to
    use only to find that your boss is committed to never paying for a font... He
    might even ask you to pirate it, and if you refuse he might -perversely- think
    less of you.\r\n\r\nHere's something:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-cond-pro/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Finding a suitable free font seems like it's going to be more expensive. Perhaps
    you should let your boss's boss know. ;-)"

    Pro Bold Condensed one):\"\r\nNo problem...\r\n\r\n\" I have to put long texts
    in small areas\"\r\nNot great for the older and younger reader...\r\n\r\n\"so
    I need a font with strong angles, 0, 45, 90, \"\r\n I'm not sure this is entirely
    possible. 90 and 0 are gained by not using italic, but 45 degrees so as not to
    have uneven steps,  bold and narrow and long reading... \r\n\r\nEven if you are
    just a programmer, designer or milk man familiar with Myriad Pro Bold Condensed,
    and you know that a 45 degree line of any thickness will occupy as much horizontal
    space as it does vertical space, (making an \"N\" with a 45 degree angle similar
    in width to a square), you can see that a narrow or condensed AKMNQRVWXYZ and
    many more, are not going to have 45 degree features without becoming highly unfamiliar
    to readers of all ages and time zones over long text. \r\n\r\nHope that helps,
    try not to hurt your boss, and Good luck!"

  body: "At the end I explained the problems to my boss, and he incredibly understood:
    the winner font is Codename Coder Free 4F, that I already suggested the day before
    (and was dumped).\r\nI found a few nice commercial fonts too, but they all had
    a problem in my environment. CCF4 is perfect at 95%, if we consider that I had
    to abandon the bold and condensed style (for readability problem, as suggested
    here by someone of you).\r\nTo put long text I have to change spacing and horizontal
    scaling a bit, but the texts look nice anyway.\r\n\r\nAnyway I rebuilt the layout
    engine, and now is very fast to switch between fonts by XML, so if want to try
    another font or use different fonts on different apps it while be a matter of
    minutes!\r\n\r\nThank you all :)"
