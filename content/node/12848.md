  body: "Maybe it has something derrogatory to it? \"Gothic\" architecture wasn't
    called gothic in th Middle Ages, rather \"The New Style\" or \"The French Style\"
    or even sometimes \"The International Style.\" During the Renaissance, it because
    known as gothic after it was surpased by the Italian classicist revival\u2026
    the \"goths\" had destroyed the Roman Empire, i.e., all that was true and good
    in architecture for the Renaissance Italians. Therefore, medieval architecture
    was Gothic (barbarian), while their new style was \"true to the roots,\" so to
    speak.\r\n\r\nSans Serifs first appeared in the 1800s. The Gothic style of architecture
    was undergoing an international revival during this time. Maybe type people of
    the day called those sans serifs \"gothics\" because they didn't like them (the
    German term for this style of sans serif is Grotesk, which seems to imply that
    people must have, at one point, found them \"grotesque\").\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "According to the New Oxford American Dictionary, <em>gothic</em> at one time
    meant \"not classical,\" i.e., not Greek or Roman.\r\n\r\nThe term was/is used
    mainly by American type founders. Besides the German \"grotesk\" there is also
    the British \"grotesque\" and the French \"antique\" designations for the style."

  body: For type there are seldom really nice clean answers. Especially when looking
    at type's history. The more you look the messier it is. That's one of the reasons
    why this board is so useful.

  body: "Gothic architecture has circular arches instead of pointed ones. Most of
    the first gothic fonts were constructions of circles and lines. I see a connection
    there.\r\n\r\nI'm just glad there's still someplace in the world where people
    don't say \"gothic\" when they mean blackletter."

    arches are rounded. At least that\xB4s what they always teached me in art history
    classes.\r\n\r\nAnd that\xB4s why it is so confusing that sans serif typefaces
    sometimes are called gothic.\r\n"

    be that the typefaces are responsible for my misremembering.

  body: "Blackletter is related to Gothic architecture in style and date, Gothic is
    more reflective of the Industrial Revolution. However the compact OED gives this
    definition, see point 4, however point 3 could be more reflective of early sans
    serifs, I don't have access to the OED so I can't give the etymology. \r\nGothic\r\n\u2022
    adjective 1 relating to the ancient Goths or their extinct language. 2 of the
    style of architecture prevalent in western Europe in the 12th-16th centuries,
    characterized by pointed arches and elaborate tracery. 3 portentously gloomy or
    horrifying. 4 (of lettering) derived from the angular style of handwriting with
    broad vertical downstrokes used in medieval western Europe. \r\nTim"

    Accident of history. In many cases an ideosycratic personal history.  \r\n\r\nEverything

  body: "Dan is closest to the mark, I think. The OED gives one definition of 'gothic'
    as:\r\n\r\n<em>4. Barbarous, rude, uncouth, unpolished, in bad taste.</em>\r\n\r\nciting
    as the earliest used in English literature:\r\n\r\n<em>1695. Dryden. 'All that
    has nothing of the Ancient gust is call'd a barbarous or Gothique manner.'</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    usage was certainly well established -- and reinforced by the prejudices of neo-classicism
    -- by the time the first sans serif types appeared in the early 19th century.
    Later in that century, of course, there was a Gothic revival in art and architecture
    in Britain, which found its typographic expression in the works of the Kelmscott,
    Vale, etc. presses.\r\n\r\n"

    \u201CThe Nymph and the Grot: The revival of the sanserif letter\u201D (London:
    Friends of the St. Bride Printing Library, 1999). That essay, first published
    in 1965 (<em>Typographica</em>, new series, no. 12, London: Lund Humphries, 1965,
    pp.2\u201319) was reissued in connection with the exhibition <a href=\"http://www.stbride.org/soanepr.htm\"><em>Primitive
    Types</em></a> (29 January \u2013 24 April 1999) organised by The Friends of The
    St. Bride Printing Library in association with Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum. Sir
    John Soane\u2019s revival of sans-serif (1816) most curiously coincides with the
    apparition of the well-known \u201CEgyptian\u201D type in the specimen book of
    William Caslon IV."

    service the advertising industry, in which sans serif and display faces dominate,

    of land tended by little Franks, (not the wee wieners you get at cheap cocktail
    parties), and their ancient rivals, de Goths, with whom they fought almost continuously
    for all the centuries they coexisted in the west\u2014 you might better name a
    font Yankees Red Sox, Bush Bin Laden or Microsoft Europa ;) And, from my reading
    of history, the fact that the Goths never settled down to become good Romans is
    precisely why we know and have so little evidence of them, their name is associated
    with barbarism, compared to, Burgundians, Lombards and especially Franks, who
    did become Romananized, Holy even, and to this day Palatino and Franklin should
    not be used together. "
