  clients are late 20's to early 40's. I have drawn it from a combination of different
  typfaces. I need some help on the tracking and anything you think is not working.\r\n\r\nThanks,

  body: The "salon | spa" text is Avant Garde. If I had to guess, I'd say the "vibe"
    part is custom-drawn - in several details it doesn't look quite like what a real
    font designer would do. [now waits until somebody points out that it is a font,
    and from a famous designer, no less]

      have found the proper typeface and used it. i need some feedback, opinions,

  body: The counter of the b makes the character as a whole appear to narrow. I wonder
    if correcting this will help the e feel more correct.

  body: if they want an !, then shouldn't the i be red as well? i think it would hold
    together if the i were red and the red o were a heavier weight than the rest.
    then it would be seen as more deliberate and not just a mistake.

    the "o" heavier. Is it working better now?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vibe-Salon-Spa-Logo1_4154.jpg]

  body: i think the red o is still too small and far away to be read as the point
    of an exclamation mark. perhaps increasing the size of the salon|spa line and
    moving it a tad closer to the vibe line would do the trick?

  body: I think you should try not spacing the letters and then tightening up the
    linespacing. This will get you closer to an exclamation point. I'd also suggest
    a lighter weight for vibe or a slightly heavier weight for salon|spa. I have a
    feeling that because you are trying to conjoin the lines you will have more luck
    with this.

  body: for the solution you are aiming, this is probably closer, but even still the
    letter-spacing in 'vibe' is far too loose. you've eliminated the ability to letter-space
    with your desire to join the two lines together with one visual glyph.

  body: sorry, new to the boards, so i don't know if its bad form to post image-based
    suggestions...i think you need to cheat bits of the face (make the 'e' a bit larger,
    make the ascenders on the "i" and the "b" taller, trim the divider line between
    'salon' and 'spa') and go for a little contrast in weight between the tyson and
    futura (?)... and i agree with all other posters about tightening up the linespacing
    on 'vibe'...i'm attaching a jpeg to show what i'm thinking... anyways, a great
    idea lisa, hope the project goes well![img:sites/default/files/old-images/maybe_6043.jpg]

  body: It's getting a bit too busy now I think. I like the "i" in red, but I would
    look at keeping it separate from the salon/spa. I think you're close, overall
    it has a good feel to it, just needs to be finessed.

    Also look at making Salon a cap S and Spa a cap S you already have an l, it might
    work better

    don't mind the inclusion of the exclamation mark, but not totally convinced that
    it's not taking the identity too far.\r\n\r\nLooking good though.\r\n\r\n\r\n<label><a

    they red in the logo will look a bit odd with just the i in red when not used
    with the subtitle. Might just make all the type the same colour. \r\n\r\nAnd the
    ampersand isn't terribly interesting. maybe find a better one to use...with a
    different font altogethar :P"
