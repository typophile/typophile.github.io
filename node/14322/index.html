  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My organisation uses [[Baskerville]] in its identity. There are ten distinct branches; the attachments show the central office and (in better clarity) one of the regional offices. You can find out more here:

http://www.gos.gov.uk

All are part of the UK government.

I've recently been asked, in my capacity as a designer at one of the offices, to help with branding guidelines. The current branding was issued in 1994, and is in use at 11 offices across England, each employing about 300 people (so maybe 3500 total). It appears on business cards, signage, stationery, PowerPoint presentations and everything else you'd associate with a large corporation.

Given the installed base, I can't recommend substantial alteration to the identity. But I am considering resetting the text. You'll have noticed it uses artificial small caps: in my opinion, this is a poor choice, particularly as the ITC New Baskerville used has a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/itc-new-baskerville/">small caps version</a>. Thus, I'm considering the following options:

1. Leave everything as it is. This is cheapest, and no hassle.

2. Switch to ITC New Baskerville (small caps), and recommend upgrading all signage, stationery and so on immediately at considerable expense.

3. Switch to ITC New Baskerville (small caps), and recommend that it's implemented when possible (eg. change website immediately, b/c on next order, signage can remain).

4. Recommend switching to one of the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/john-baskerville/john-baskerville/">other</a> <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/baskerville-mt/">baskervilles</a> <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EFoIMrsOT.php">available</a>, and either update all immediately (as 2) or when necessary (as 3).


Let me know your thoughts, and arguments for or against change. I need to make a presentation on this a week today; after that, I'd need to get buy-in at director level. Change is possible, but I need to project a very cogent case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, IMHO *any* Baskerville is better than ITC's... I think Adobe's Berthold Baskerville has a lot more character and is probably more usable in an office environment (due to less contrast). Addin g the Book variant to the mix gives you even more options.
BTW: These are available as OpenType.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's what I've got so far:

http://gtmail.150m.com/baskervilles.gif

I found some Baskervilles not previously mentioned (look near the top of <a href="http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/choice.html">this page</a>), including Timberwolf's Baskerville 1757. My graphic compares this with ITC New Baskerville, Storm's John Baskerville, and Mrs Eaves.

Two Baskervilles I couldn't find samples of, and would have considered, are the <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90131.html">Berthold</a> and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=243211">Monotype</a> versions. Are these worth pursuing? 

So far, I'm favouring ITC New Baskerville, since it's nearest to what we're already using. The Storm design has a low small caps height, which I'm not keen on. I do really like Mrs Eaves, although it's a bit of a departure. Viewed with the arms, they look like this:

http://gtmail.150m.com/Arms-version.gif

I think what I might do, rather than giving the decision makers the choice between artificial small caps (as we have now) and genuine small caps, is to give them the choice between ITC small caps and Mrs Eaves. I'd be happy with either.</div>

Sounds like a plan. There is such a thing as freedom <strong>from</strong> choice too!

To me, Mrs Eaves looks more attractive, but the ITC is more British.

BTW, those links need a "www" to work.

Your first link is not working.
The ITC version of the Arms is looking better than Mrs Eaves which looks a bit lacking in contrast, however the ITC version needs some attention paid to the kerning.

As much as I want to vote for Mrs. Eaves, and it could very well be that I'm biased, it just is too precious for use in a government situation. I vote for Storm, but scale the small caps up a hair more. And when I say hair, I mean 1 or 2 percent ... maybe 3.</div>

Aside from aesthetic considerations (I would go for ITC New Baskerville (small caps), anyway) there is no real argument for any other kind of change...'I’d like to change the identity to XXX typeface because it looks better'.. This is neither relevant, useful nor valuable.
Fixing the error (artificial small caps) is useful, since 'auto small caps' can be application dependent, i.e. default small caps values vary. I fail to see the point of specifying percentages for caps when there's a well design small caps font in the family
