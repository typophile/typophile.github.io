body: "Hi there,\r\nI\u2019m redesigning a well known album at the moment. I was wondering
  how you would go about kerning a quotation intended to be placed at the centre of
  a page. As the attatchment shows I am using Gill Sans MT throughout the booklet
  and therefore using it for the quotation. I am considering using a typeface with
  pre-set ligatures, but for the moment I wondered if anyone could suggest how best
  to kern this piece of type. I would be very greatful for any feedback and continue
  posting the remainder of the booklet at a later date after feedback.\r\n\r\nThe
  second image is just one of the images =I am using for the final booklet made from
  over 400 lit tealight candles.\r\n\r\nCheers again."
