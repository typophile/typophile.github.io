<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone know the name of the company who designed the "GO" logo (in green leaf) as shown on the site below.
http://www.whyboq.com/Identity_Building-Vancouver.jpg
I am pretty sure that Whyboq did not design this logo and are passing it off as their own.
Additionally they have appropriated the "Sauce" identity (scroll down on their site). It was stolen directly from my site
(http://www.miaandjem.com/work.php?subcatid=2) and the company name changed from Marmalade to Sauce. Unbelivable how desperate some people can be, pathetic!
I would love to let the REAL designer of GO know.
Thanks.</div>

Just kidding. That <em>is</em> incredibly pathetic. What's more, I saw this kind of thing in design school, and the instructors would just let it slide, knowing full well what was up. Is that commonplace?</div>

I think it is apparent that some of these plagiarised logos at whyboq have never been printed. Just take a look at those chopsticks here: http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B00008XV3P.03.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
And the napkin ring is here: http://www.conran-restaurants.co.uk/media/images/products/large/grey-napkin-ring.jpg

Thanks Ragnar, really nice work on your site too.
I definitely intend to ask them to remove our work from their site. I guess this is one of the down sides to an on-line portfolio.
I wonder how much of the work shown is actually theirs, there are too many different visual styles for my liking.
(and yes we did not stick the Marmalade logo on chopsticks or Conran napkin rings, god forbid!!!!)

I've had some of my students cheat in this manner, but no so blatantly. Plagiarism is not always immediately apparent. If I didn't notice it at first, I'm hesitant to bring it up, because I feel stupid for not having called them on it immediately. I wouldn't want to make them redo an entire project because I had failed to point out a mistake earlier, that would be my fault, wouldn't it? Because I had failed to draw the distinction between homage and plagiarism. So, if I notice plagiarism, I check with other staff, and give the student the benefit of the doubt that they didn't know what they did was wrong, explain why it was, don't make them redo the project, and apologize for having to give them a lower mark for the work.
Usually, plagiarization is not so blatant as the 3 grey blobs.
But just suppose it was a slightly different color, slightly different arrangement of 3 blobs...
***
But hey, this is a typography forum.
Plagiarism is no big deal in type design -- large software companies have appropriated others' type designs with impunity. Looks like it's infectious.
***
File sharing:
With the present consensus on the acceptability of file "sharing", this kind of plagiaristic design behavior may well now only be considered wrong for not giving accreditation: recycling a design, even copying files, is the way of the future. You know what they say -- embrace the technology, the law is out of date...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Jem,
I'm apalled by the guy!
Send a formally written email. Then persist - let him know you're fully prepared to seek legal advice to take the matter further.
Once he's aware you're on his case, I'm sure your work will *mysteriously* disappear from his site. I find it frustrating even if & when (I really hope it's 'when' and not 'if') the work is removed, to know that he might well have used yours and others' work to attract clients.
I really like your work, by the way!

<div class=commentbody>Get used to it, folks: the latest issue of <em>Wired</em> magazine has an entire section devoted to the Remix Revolution, otherwise known as cut-and-paste with the stars. As you doubtless know, this particular pastime freely appropriates other people's work, and claims its merit by the "artistic" rearrangement or juxtaposition of elements. In almost all of the cases where practitioners were interviewed, they clearly viewed the finished product as their own work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Looking at that site's home page, it appears to not be a 'guy' or 'design firm' as much as it is a temp agency...sourcing designers from all over the place.
Perhaps the logos shown are so varied in style simply because of the varied designers they may have hired...and perhaps one (some) are into the plagiarizing thing.
But that's just a theory...maybe it is one guy and he's just an ass.

True, but the ethos of remix/filesharing culture is "Whatever you can get away with is OK", which makes that subtle distinction irrelevant.
Actually, that seems to be the general principle of Western society today.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's certainly all put togther by that one person. Looks to me like a reused portfolio of student work for fictional or arbitarily chosen existing companies.
"Wat Serwat" turns up no search results at all in Google and "viburnumtrilorum.com" is not a registered domain.
And yes the that "GO" logo looks very familiar.
Looks to me he wanted a client portfolio for his new venture (2005 according to resume) and realised with no clients he'd have to shortcut.</div>

Sounds like a Thai temple. Try a variant spelling of "Serwat" - Thai transliteration can be quite free-wheeling.

<div class=commentbody>Nice. Or even better: Tell them you're going to contact the client -and maybe alert all their other clients while you're at it- about the plagiarism, but you'd like to give them a chance to "suggest an alternative"... You might use the telephone to do that, instead of putting it in writing. And remember to stay cool - it'll make your hold on their balls that much more firm.

<div class=commentbody>As of this morning he has removed our work and Form's work from his site.
Good.
Anyone seen the "Wat Serwatt" identity before?
No such company exists on the web, hmmm.

<div class=commentbody>Having witnessed the life of this thread, what an interesting read it has been. If someone captured the original website page before it was edited (it was a single jpg image) it would be useful to post it again so that others can see what this discussion has been about. I must say one thing... the guy had good taste in what he stole!
