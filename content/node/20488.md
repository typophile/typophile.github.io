  body: if your search is concerned primarily with function, take a look at the Freight
    family. the Text series is closer in color, but Micro might serve the purpose
    with greater efficiency. though not quite as extreme in the x-hieght, it serves
    much the same purpose. there is also the benefit of an expansive selection and
    more contemporary feel.
