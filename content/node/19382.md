  body: Is there more? This is looking like quick and dirty illustrator to me, but
    I've been wrong about this before.

    body: this is all i've seen as far as these letters go. it's not zeppelin either,
      if you notice the curves of the "S" are significantly different, as well as
      the axial, not radial cuts.
