  also seen it used for promotional materials for the band Blonde Redhead. Therefore,
  I'm led to believe that it may be available as a font... Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brakhage_3504.jpg]"

    is different - is this the one you mean (tour dates)?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blonde-redhead.com/tour.html\r\n\r\nThat
    font is called Ambrosia, and it's a freebie\r\n\r\nhttp://www.getfreefonts.info/free_font.ambrosia.html"

  body: "No, I'm not thinking of Ambrosia. Here's one piece using that same text style...
    I suppose they both may be handlettered, or maybe they just appropriated the letterforms
    from the Brakhage film.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blonde_redhead_6342.jpg]"
