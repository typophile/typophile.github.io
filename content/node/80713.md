  anybody using small cups with swashes? In what situations can it be useful?  I'm
  asking 'cos I made them in my font but then began to doubt if it was reasonable.
  Could you remember some examples of fonts with swashed small caps and maybe show
  pictures with washed small caps in use? Thank you!"

  body: "I don't recall any types with swashed small caps.\r\nYou could experiment
    with a typeface that has Swash caps, making a faux small cap, and seeing what
    it looks like (use the Stroke feature in InDesign/Illustrator).\r\nOr maybe you
    could work with a type that has Swash caps, and make the swash small caps different,
    so that a setting of Swash Caps with Swash Small Caps would have a unique look."

  body: "The thing about swash capitals is that they\u2019re usually only useful with
    in combination with lowercase, rarely in an all-caps setting (in fact, such practice
    is usually frowned upon).\r\n\r\nSo, since small caps are generally intended for
    use together \u2014 a smaller rendition of all-caps\_\u2014 the idea of swash
    small caps is a bit counterintuitive.\r\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that one couldn\u2019t
    conceive of a few small caps in more decorative variants, like the kind of <em>J
    N T Y</em> that were typical in, say, a Baskerville-style italic. But beyond that,
    I don\u2019t think such a thing would be very useful.\r\n\r\n"

    tool for establishing hierarchy (handy for setting roman numerals too ;-)\r\n\r\nExcept
    for the roman numerals, in this context only middle and final forms would be required."

  body: Thanks a lot for your comments! Now I see that doing swashed small caps was
    unreasonable, but they are done... So maybe they will be useful for formal invitations
    at least. And what about title pages? Can they be used there?

  body: "The most worrying thing is that my swashed small caps are equal to swashed
    capitals (first I made swashed capitals and then decided to do small caps for
    them). Most of them are initial forms with upper-left swashes, but there are several
    that can be used also as the middle or final forms (A, R, K, Z, \u042F). So here
    is the picture of swashed capitals and small caps:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swashed_small_caps_5695.png]"

  body: I can see using the swash small caps as the first and/or last letter of a
    word or line, but I think it'd look terrible to have an entire word or line of
    all swash. You might want to have some examples in your type specimen showing
    the user how to set them tastefully (as opposed to just turning OT All Small Caps
    and OT Swash on).

  body: 'Thanks for advice! Yes, I suppose that swashed small caps could be used at
    the beginning or end of the word with other small caps (r and k in the middle
    also) and in the combination with the first capital letter and other small caps
    (one of them may be the swashed middle or end form). I don''t think somebody would
    like a word in all swashed small caps. For that case I wrote exclusions in the
    OT features for some swashes to be used only in the beginning of the word. Maybe
    it could look like this: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Swashed_smcp2_6215.png]'

  body: "Very nice, tasteful demonstration of the swashes in use. Of course, most
    good typographers will choose letter by letter when to use the swash characters,
    regardless of what rules you program into the font. But the swash characters look
    really nice.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: Yeah, great examples! Is the TT in LETTER a ligature? At the size you posted
    it it looks a bit odd, almost like two Ts touching but not quite integrated.

  body: "Yes, TT is a ligature, I made it to improve letter spacing between two Ts
    (both in capital and small caps variants). First I tried to make it with common
    horizontal bar (without a center vertical serif), but it seemed to me reminding
    a cyrillic letter \u041F and I decided to add this vertical serif to avoid confusion
    with \u041F, since I do cyrillic too. "

  body: Some of Slimbach's faces (e.g., Brioso) have a TT ligature with no center
    serif, and it looks all right for decorative settings; I think, though I would
    rather use a ligature with a single bar or two separate Ts; the ligature above
    looks a little bit like a kerning mistake.
