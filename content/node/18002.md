body: I assume it's good practice to make sure all points line up on the grid. But
  what if the intersection of two combined paths, let's say, a crossbar plus a stem,
  do not fall on the grid? If I don't add these paths into one, a paste in FontLab
  reveals some funky path inversions... Should I just ignore the misplacement of intersected
  points?

    you do have the option of writing your own illustrator to UFO conversion script
    because the UFO file format allows floating point coordinates. '
