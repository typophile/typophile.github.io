  making fonts for use on the Millennium Embroidery machine.  We do embroidery where
  I work and a lot of times I will make the design first in Coreldraw for print or
  screenprint, then it will get sent over to embroidery to be digitized again if the
  clients want it sewn. \r\n\r\nThe guy who runs embroidery always complains he has
  to draw out all the letters except when I use when of maybe five fonts, like Arial,
  Lubalin, and a couple others.  It would be great if I could make some fonts for
  the machine.  I've looked around on the web and there seems to be very little information
  on this.  Moreover, I gather there are 2 types of embroidery fonts, one, called
  a keyboard font which works they way one would expect fonts to work, and another
  which I don't understand at all but seems to not be usable to type out text with
  ( I know, that's not a really a font then is it? Maybe it's like individual monograms?)\r\n\r\nCould
  anybody shed some light?  Is there by any chance a way to make embroidery fonts
  with Fontlab?"

    of for example <A href="http://quality.e-patches.ca/asg-paintball-patches/">paintball
    patches</a>, and i think your post will be an inspiration for me. In my embroidered
    patches I often use another method but Your is good. Great work!

    machines are made by an Asian company named Happy, which I always thought was
    pretty hilarious considering the average mood of the people running the machines.

  body: "The following comments refer to what's commonly referred to has home embroidery
    software, as opposed to commercial software. The line between them isn't clear.
    I've heard of Millenium professional software, but am not familiar with  Millenium
    \ sewing/embroidery machine.\r\n\r\nActually, there are  at least five different
    ways to embroider text.\r\n\r\n1)  Some embroidery software programs, such as
    Brothers PE Design and Bernina's Artista can create text directly using installed
    Truetype fonts (Note that ONLY Truetype fonts can be used; such programs effectively
    do their own rendering and can only process truetype fonts).\r\n\r\n2) Some embroidery
    programs include a number of built-in typstyles.\r\n\r\n3) Some embroider programs
    use stand-alone (usually overpriced) proprietary fonts. These include Embird and
    Viking/Pfaff software.\r\n\r\n4) You can always use pre-built designs; these are
    designs in the shapes of letters or words.\r\n\r\n5) Just about all embroidery
    sewing machines themselves have a number of built-in typefaces\r\n\r\nIn addition,
    there is software available, such as the Husqvarna Viking suite, that can convert
    PC Truetype fonts to a set of separate designs (item 4 above) or to its own proprietary
    format (item 3 above)  \r\n\r\nMy own terminology choice in embroidery is to use
    \r\n\r\n\"embroidery alphabet\" for a set of letter-shaped designs, \r\n\"embroidery
    font\" for a proprietary font usable with specific embroidery software\r\n \r\nHowever,
    this is far from the norm; just as graphical alphabets, such as those found on
    scrapbooking sites, are often referred to as \"fonts\".\r\n\r\n  - Herb\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here's  Millenium's page on using TrueType fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.embroidery-machine-software.com/lettering_true_type.html\r\n\r\nAs
    I read it, the program (or at least Millenium III) can use truetype fonts. It
    creates its own internal format and saves it for future use.  It can use any font
    that's available on the host system.  If you want your service provider to use
    fonts that they don't have installed, you would only have to provide him with
    the fonts, paying due attention to the licensing rights and probably purchasing
    the font(s) for them. For many reasons, they may be averse to installing anything
    beyond what they already have.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    font, but I did once design a fashion label logo that leveraged the medium:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Karey_Label_6627.png]\r\nThe
    execution wandered from the concept slightly, but I was nonetheless quite pleased
    with the effect.\r\n"
