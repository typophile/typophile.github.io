  body: Matthew, in the first version the J &#40;in John&#39;s&#41;looks so strange,
    its visually out of sinc with the other characters. I&#39;m also not loving th
    Of combination. I do like making connectors like &#40;the and of&#41; less important
    than the group title. Overall the first version feels forced. The second version
    gives me no emotional feeling at all. Think about using a symbol with the title.
    Are they a part of a religious order? How many gentlemen are they? If its a few
    maybe show their faces? So far I think you could use the same type and say John
    Deere Tractors, I&#39;m not getting music or singing.

  body: 'Mathew: <BR> <BR>I like the general concept of the first design, but the
    execution needs a lot of work. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s an off-the-shelf
    unicase font or not, but most of those letters just aren&#39;t working together.
    Also, I agree with Daniel in regard to downplaying the &#34;the/of&#34; connectors.
    <BR> <BR>My initial thought with this type was to loosen it up and juxtaposition
    each of the letters so they look like dancing letters, but that doesn&#39;t really
    go to well with &#34;sacred music&#34;. <BR> <BR>The strong, tight verticals in
    this type actually remind me of a line of chior singers. Maybe use musical notes
    to make the letters sing, or actually morph the letters &#40;or some of them if
    it&#39;s a small group...i.e. John&#41; into the chior singers. <BR> <BR>Keep
    working. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll come up with something that works.'

  body: 'Bj, I&#39;m not sure whether we would be modern or not -  we are 14 singers
    who spend most of our time singing in the choir at St John&#39;s College, Cambridge.
    So there&#39;s a limit to how modern you can be. The previous logo &#40;which
    uses ITC Tiffany&#41; can be found <a href="http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/gents/images/logo_trans.gif">here</a>.
    <BR>I was trying to get away from the staid image slightly, as it&#39;s not ideal
    for promotional material. <BR> <BR>The latter logo was an attempt at a more professional
    look, but it is not engaging. Anyone have any ideas for typefaces that would suit?
    <BR> <BR>Colour scheme: mostly red with 90% red, 10% white, black stripe through
    white. <BR>In practice the logo would want to be either red or black. <BR> <BR>Matthew'
