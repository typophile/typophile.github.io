  body: Frank could you repost using a gif or jpg format. I hate pdfs

- body: Dan, you&#39;re funny. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Frank.. with the PDF, the line work
    looks pixelated, like it was drawn with the pencil tool in photoshop rather than
    being vector. Is it just the preview? The lines seem a little shaky, and ya may
    end up having to make them thicker, unless the printer says they can keep it from
    bleeding. With the letterhead, the red is very very strong, and I bet you could
    get away with having the top about half as tall as it is now. Have you tried faxing
    and copying these?

  body: I actually like the big red block, but making it  smaller won&#39;t hurt it
    too much and will give you a little more room. As long as your stroke is 1 to
    1.5 point your printer should be able to hold it &#40;although you may have to
    request metal plates&#41; If they can&#39;t find a new  printer.

  body: '&#40;they are screenshots right? not actual printable PDFs&#41; <BR> <BR>all
    i gotta say is i don&#39;t trust you! no but really, the name itself is hard to
    trust, and the red color with whispering doesn&#39;t enhance the trustability.  <BR>
    <BR>beside that, it&#39;s plain and okay, just nothing that stands out among other
    designs.'

  body: I concur that GIF file is always preferable to a PDF. <BR> <BR>As for the
    letterhead, what&#39;s the context? I guess it looks OK.

  body: Frank, I like the design &#40;the drawing could use some polish&#41;, but
    it doesn&#39;t say &#34;trust me&#34; to me. No faces, whispering secrets. I get
    the concept, but I&#39;m not sure it reads in the design. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    some intense letterhead. I&#39;m not sure that something that bold needs to be
    that big as well. <BR> <BR>Also, I agree that PDFs are annoying if not supplemented
    by JPEGs or GIFs for quick viewing.

  body: i think the &#39;big red block&#39; and the whispering looks a bit boring.
    It does look playful though and ummm not so pro. Ya i must agree with loren i
    cant trust it either.

  body: I guess it depends on what you consider &#34;pro.&#34; A pro law firm? No.
    Design? Why not? Certain professions have more leeway. Whether or not it looks
    like pro design is rather subjective. I like the big red area, one of the reasons
    being that it reduces the amount of usable space on the page, making correspondence
    shorter &#40;hopefully&#41; and more efficient &#40;hopefully&#41; as well as
    making the copy look less deserted on the page. I also prefer business cards to
    be one sided, but that may be due to me being a simpleton.

      and had a kid.\r\n\r\nSorry about the bad previews. I had no idea they were
      of such poor quality. I promise to do better next time.\r\n\r\nNever trust anyone
      who says Trust Me. That's the joke. The original logo was cooling towers."
