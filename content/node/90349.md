body: "Prored is an avantgarde sans serif typeface that contains 5 weights \u2013
  Light, Regular, Bold, ExtraBold and Black.\r\n\r\nIt is small and compact font family
  with own characteristic expression, constructed to be safe choice for all kinds
  of typographic tasks.\r\n\r\nWith specific curved endings that are adhered on baseline,
  Prored includes tiny note of singularity \u2013 just enough to make it\u2019s own
  identity recognizable and catchy. \r\n\r\nTaller x-height gives an afterimage of
  a bit narrowed look, but with rational proportions and well balanced weights, 5
  of them are really sufficient and capable to handle extreme typographic issues.
  Especially charming is Black which can be used also as display typeface in situations
  where elegant solutions are required in combination with stronger visibility.\r\n\r\nBeside
  Central Europe, Prored also contains glyphs for Turkish and Baltic languages.\r\n\r\nHighly
  neutral impression recommends Prored as an excellent choice for branding campaigns
  or new identities.\r\n\r\nDesigned by Slobodan Jelesijevic, 2012.\r\n\r\nRecommended
  for use in: \r\nbranding campaigns, identities, editorial publications, packages,
  web design, as web font and many more.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Prored_Typophile_6236.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.tourdefonts.com/new-release-prored/|Read
