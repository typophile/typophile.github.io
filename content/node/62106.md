  proud Fountain production: \r\n\r\nHeroine Pro - a blast from the past\r\n\r\nAmazingly
  designed by G\xF6ran S\xF6derstr\xF6m.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heroine_4048.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nLast
  week we released a movie trailer for the Heroine. \r\nWe are very happy that to
  this day there's been over 12000 unique views at YouTube.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n_jfSk\r\n\r\nHeroine
  is inspired by the typeface Windsor, designed by Eleisha Pechey in 1905. Windsor
  is the typeface used in the titles of many Woody Allen films. A modern interpretation
  of this rusty pearl is something that is something that has always been missing
  in the major type libraries. But Heroine is not only an interpretation, it goes
  beyond that. With the addition of swashes and alternate letters in several styles
  it becomes very addictive.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s like a breeze of Art Noveau with modern
  bezier skills, old and new celebrated in a typeface family with 9 styles. The weights
  are handpicked with small steps between them to bring out the best of Heroine. True
  to history, condensed versions are also included in the family.\r\n\r\nSwashes,
  small caps*, extended language support, ligatures and OpenType features are included.\r\n[*
  Small Caps not incl. in Heroine Pro - Black]\r\n\r\n******************************************************************\r\n\r\nHeroine
