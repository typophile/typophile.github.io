  body: "The _a_ is very distinctive and an edited version of Priori Serif is perhaps
    the source of your image. The other letters resemble Times Roman. Possibly TR
    was edited to include an _a_ in the style of Priori Serif. \r\nHave you checked
    the other fonts by the designers of Priori Serif,  Jonathan Barnbrook and Marcus
    Leis Allion to see if they have produced another retail font with the _a_.\r\nAt
    least some of their fonts are listed at at Identifont  http://www.identifont.com/show?1HU
    and http://www.identifont.com/show?30W\r\nI note that Jonathan Barnbrook does
    corporate identities. This might be worth checking as a possible source of the
    lettering in your image.\r\nDon"

  body: "The 'a' only resembles the one from Priori Serif, and the other letters are
    quite different. The E is not like Times NR, nor is the 'i'. Are there any other
    places where this font is used, so we could see more letters? I agree with Don
    that there could be some customizing happening, maybe just for a logo.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I just searched through my [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]], which has nearly 2,200 serif font families keyed for various
    letter attributes. There were 439 serif families with E's with no serif on the
    middle arm of the E, but not one that I found matching this sample.  That either
    means it is custom, or a font I have missed in my collecting. (Or possibly, I
    overlooked it in my review, but I think I was thorough.)\r\n\r\nI know that may
    not be a definitive answer, but it is a data point.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Good find Akira.\r\nAt the larger scale we can now see that resemblance to
    Times Roman is mainly in the stroke weight. The serif treatment is a stark Latinate
    triangle.\r\nDon"
