body: "I'm trying to track down and license a font called Chelmsford. It's influenced
  by/derived/ripped-off from Optima, but comes in a very light weight and has a few
  added touches -- an Optima Titling Light, if you will. Check out the A, for example.\r\n\r\nMy
  guess is that this dates back to the early days of DTP, and is a digitization of
  someone's film/CRT version of Optima. MyFonts, Fontshop and Fonts.com (along with
  a general Google search) didn't turn up anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chelmsford_3728.jpg]"

  body: "This goes way back... before DTP. But the A is not something Zapf did, or
    I think would do.\r\n\r\nCheck ot Optima Nova. There you will get the weight you
    want and the author's true forms.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "And the A is actually very ugly and ill fitting with the rest of the font.
    Too heavy, stilted to the right and has few weight consistencies with the other
    letters.\r\n\r\nProbably Compugraphic or VGC.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: This was an old AM (Addressograph-Multigraph) font from the seventies. Seems
    like I saw a digital version of it years ago, but I don't recall when or where.
    The "Q" is arbitrarily different, too, and can still be seen on Minnesota-based
    QUAST Trucking vehicles. I still wince a little when I see it.

    dealing with a font specified by a 3rd party.\r\n\r\nI've proposed Optima Nova
    Light as a substitute."

  body: "Marcox,\r\n\r\n   Did you ever find Chelmsford in a digitized format? I try
    downloading a font called OKLAHOMA, and I believe I'm getting Chelmsford, possibly,
    instead. Or there is some conflict with this OKLAHOMA font and some font which
    is or is similar to Chelmsford (it could even be Optima). I remember Chelmsford,
    and how much it looked like Optima, when I owned & lease some AM Varityper equipment
    (I got screwed out of a lot of money by that company) back in the eighties - may
    they NOT rest in peace).\r\n"

    be a routine cost of business. Optima Nova was for a magazine which redesigned
    in 2009, so we've gotten 3 years out of it.
