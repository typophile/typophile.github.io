body: This is my first dabble at doing a font. <BR>Far from finished, and I&#39;m
  sure it&#39;s been done a hundred times before. But I thought I&#39;d post it, as
  I&#39;m a long time lurker here. <BR>Personally I like the A, D, T and S.. not sure
  about the rest though.. What do you think? <BR>&#40;the name is from A Clockwork
  Orange, I love that book.&#41; <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7442.gif"

  body: the outline kind of looks like a bike chain too. <BR> <BR>I think some of

  body: Wild. Reminds me a bit of the Outwest series. Same genre? Maybe? Definitely
    a font in need of a niche, but still very interesting. Perhaps the outlined version
    the stroke is too heavy?
