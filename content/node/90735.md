  in the attached logo. \r\n\r\nI have run this through several online tests, but
  so far none of the fonts seems to match. What is particularly striking is that the
  letters seem to have both round and square ends. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has an idea,
  that would be most helpful!\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nI."
