    has designed is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot/|Peignot]] but
    I really doubt it could be considered as a substitute. Do you know some more \"contrasted
    sans\" by AMC, hhp?\r\nIf I have to start with some (also well-known) contrasted
    sans, I would probably choose [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima|Optima]],
    using alternately regular and italic. "
