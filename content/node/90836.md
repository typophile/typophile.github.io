  of the thread is simple. Post your font o' the day. Whether it be something new
  you discovered and like, a classic you admire, or just an excuse to post a pretty
  specimen. Whatever you wish. \r\n\r\nFor me it will be Brandon Grotesque Bold, by
  HVD fonts.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://cdn.myfonts.net/s/aw/720x360/114/0/58494.png\"

  soft corners. "

    discovered it on the first day of my first typography class. I was enamored instantly.
    I ended up using it on my first project too. "

    doing a rush-job when producing his Italic...\r\nFor one thing, wassup with that
    \"N\" vs \"M\"?!\r\n\r\nFont of the day for me? Hmmm, maybe:\r\nhttp://www.stereotypes.de/archives/528\r\n\r\nBTW,
    may I suggest a refinement? The font of the day\r\nmust be a new discovery (to
    the person mentioning it).\r\nBut take it or leave it - no hard feelings.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm not even close to having a thorough understanding of typography, so I'm
    completely okay with it! It will help further my knowledge and help in college*.
    And I'd be okay with that, but I feared putting too much of a constraint on what's
    posted. I figured if I made it a free for all, more people would respond, and
    it could then end up being the longest thread in forum history. \r\n\r\n*That
    rhymes. "

    in an excerpt from a letterpress (photopolymer) project I'm doing below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alana_example_6628.png]\r\n\r\nLots
    of fun to play with, but while it has a ton of final alternates (for end of lines),
    it's a shame there are no initial alternates."

    (FT Weekend and How To Spend It) for ages, happened across this (http://www.fttoolkit.co.uk/2011mediakit/pdfs/FT_Weekend_Guidelines_2011.pdf)
    and all was revealed. Probably old news to everyone on here but it made my day!\r\n\r\nJust
    had a look at how expensive the fonts are... staggeringly so :( But that's a moan
    for a different thread I expect."
