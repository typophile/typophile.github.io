  body: "I think this is handwritten. See the word 'the' in the top two images. When
    you start looking there are other variations as well. Too bad, because it has
    a nice simple feel. Similar: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/wendy-lp/\">Wendy</a>
    and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-emmascript/\">Emmascript</a>.\r\n\r\n-

    in the other two (other than \u201Cthe\u201D, as Mike already noted, the \u201Co\u201D
    especially stands out)."

  body: "Thanks Fvila... it's definitely arsenale.  and check this out...  It appears
    all of the fonts are Arsenale.  Typing 'upper' or 'lower' case actually create
    different variations of the lower case.  pretty clever.  :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yep_6545.jpg]"
