  and at one point he talks about the missuse of <em>Times</em>. He goes into comparing
  the length of different lines of type made up of 26 letters \u2014from A to Z\u2014
  to show that <em>Times</em> is a very condensed type. What I don't understand is
  that he says that the average length of a line of type should be around 13 em(s).
  I though em(s) was (were) a relative mesure. "

  body: "Yes, an em is relative to the point-body, so when a typeface is set at 10
    points the em is 10 pts. wide.\r\n\r\n<em>Times</em> is (was) essentially a newspaper
    face, therefore the reference of a suggested average of 13 ems to the line actually
    refers to newspaper columns and not book setting.\r\n\r\nConsider when <em>Times</em>
    is set at 12 pts. the width of the line is 13 picas wide (12 points = 1 pica)
    or approximately 2 3/16 inches wide.\r\n\r\nA more common reference used for optimal
    reading widths is character count and not ems.\r\n"

  body: "Does that mean that the characters of <em>Times</em> are relatively narrow
    (condensed) compared to the width of it's em? \u2014the width of 26 characters
    in <em>Palatino</em> seem to correspond better with 13 em than when set in <em>Times</em>\u2014
    I hope this is not giberish to you."

  body: Though I'm not exactly sure what you are trying to determine about how well
    26 characters of a typeface fit to 13 ems, but <a href="http://www.acmedigital.net/JianSabu/13-em-column.gif"
    target="new">this GIF</a> will show Times New Roman setting narrower than Palatino.

  body: "Sebastien, I think you have misread Felici. On p. 130 he says \"the lower
    case of a *standard* text face is 13 ems long.\" He doesn't say it \"should be\",
    and doesn't say that narrower or wider faces are \"wrong\". He cites Times as
    an example of a narrower face.\r\n\r\nHe explains, \"Once the alphabet length
    of a typeface diverges more than 5 percent from the 13-em standard, you will probably
    have to adjust your point size and measure.\" (Meaning, adjust from his rule of
    thumb that the maximum measure in picas is three times the point size.)  He says
    that \"27 characters is the minimum line length, 40 the optimum, and 70 the maximum.\"
    \r\n\r\nBringhust has a somewhat different view, explaining that 45 to 75 characters
    is satisfactory for a single column of a seriffed face in a text size, with 66
    ideal. If you have discontinuous text with extra leading, you can go longer. \r\n\r\nFor
    multiple column Bringhurst recommends 40 to 50 characters. (Bringhurst has a convenient
    table showing the relationships between alphabet width and measure.)\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, Felici makes clear that there is an interaction between the width of
    the typeface, a good measure and the leading. These have to be considered together,
    and a good match found for the page size you are setting on. What is best will
    be influenced by the width of the typeface, the x-height, whether there are serifs
    or not, and other factors. So in practice you need to experiment with a particular
    typeface and page size until you find a good solution. And finding a good solution
    on size, measure, and leading is, I think, the most important aid to achieving
    a readable text, in addition to having a decently readable typeface. "

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am not that far in the book yet. I was referencing the page
    69. The captions for the <a href=http://www.lunchdesign.be/site/felici.html>figure
    5.2</a> clearly reads \u2014<em>The \u201Cstandard\u201D width for the lowercase
    alphabet of a text is 13 ems.</em>\u2014 What I don't get, and I am probably slow,
    is why the ems are used as a fixed and universal value in this case when Felici
    writes on page 24 \u2014<em>The fundamental relative unit in typography is the
    em</em>.\u2014 and just before that\u2014 <em>Relative units have no fixed value
    in terms of absolute units such as picas, inches, or millimeters.</em>\u2014 I'd
    like to understand before I continue with the book."

  body: Ok, now I've got it. It took me a while. It finaly clicked into place when
    I was writing the previous post. I hope I didn't loose my right to asked more
    stupid questions.
