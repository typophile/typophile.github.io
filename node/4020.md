body: This is a recent identity project I am doing for a client.  Rather than leaving
  it at default, I adjusted the kerning until it looked to my satisfaction.  I just
  wanted to get some feedback from this forum, since most design forums focus more
  on layout and the macro-aesthetics and I am trying to fine tune the micro. <BR>
  <BR>btw, this identity is for a mortgage company <BR>-Frank <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32285.gif"

  body: How would this work at 24 points? <BR>I think your first issue to tackle is
    balance. <BR>You have really big, and really small. <BR>Scale the whole thing
    down to 24 points, print it on a laser printer, and then re-acess the balance
    issue.

  body: Never use quotes in a tagline. There&#39;s no reason to do so and, if anything,
    hints at it being not literal. &#40;BTW, that is a poor tagline...it&#39;s way
    too generic to really have any weight.&#41; <BR> <BR>I agree with Kyle. It&#39;s
    hard to look at the micro until the macro issue of scale and balance is addressed.
    I&#39;d suggest leaving the type as-is and shrink the logo down to 10/20% of its
    current size. <BR>

  body: Since you asked about kerning, I think h-e and a-c are a bit too loose. <BR>
    <BR>As for the position, well, gosh, I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t see any kind
    of intent behind it. Align something with something.

  body: 'This is a bit off, but am I the only one who feels that the m with the dots
    looks kinda like a weird old 80s videogame character or like a simplified face
    of a comic book character... with the doors/knobs as eyes? Is that intended? Especially
    from a distance that is the effect I get from the m. Not bad per se, but I wonder
    if that is what you wanted.  <BR> <BR>The relationship between typo and visual
    mark has improved, specially as the wrong quotationmarks are gone... but there
    seems to be no specific kind of logic behind the positioning of the mplace text,
    or is there? It just doesn&#39;t feel very... constructed. '

    too. <BR> <BR>Maybe shorten the length of the &#34;m&#34; legs? Those dots are
    too small, but I think they&#39;ll look even worse bigger. Eliminate them?

    interpretations aren&#39;t neccesarily a bad thing, at least it draws in some
    level of participation...tonight I am going to post another variation and also
    explain some design methodology which might clarify.. <BR> <BR>-Frank

  body: Silos... The blue shapes have to be something. <BR> <BR>IF you make a house
    out of negative space, I am going to want to make the positive shape into something
    too. I made it a silo. <BR> <BR>I came into this discussion late, so excuse me
    if I am repeating. <BR> <BR>The houses are very elongated. Are you trying too
    hard to force the houses into an M? <BR> <BR>If you put a rectangle on the house,
    I would instantly know its a door. If you put a dot, it could be an eye, as many
    have said. If you put a dot on a door, it would be a doorknob. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: With regard to the logo, I&#39;d make the whole darn thing shorter. Normal
    houses aren&#39;t that tall relative to their width, and excepting a ski chalet,
    you won&#39;t see that acute pitch on a real roof. <BR> <BR>What if you used a
    &#39;real&#39; lc M from the same face as the caption line, and suggested houses
    in the negative space with a door, knob, and window? You&#39;ll have more unity
    in the design and it might be more obvious that the spaces are houses. <BR> <BR>As
    for the logo text itself, using all-lc in black and ocean blue is reminiscent
    of AT&amp;T&#39;s mmode/mlife thing. What about normal capitalization

  body: Hey I almost forgot about this post...I just wanted to thank everybody for
    commenting and giving their two cents. <BR> <BR>Well the client liked one of my
    latest incarnations and thus the project is finished... <BR> <BR>&#40;In hindsight
    I think I should have posted the logo at a smaller size so one could gage the
    macro-aesthetic character...it seemed like everybody was looking at it realll
    close and only then would different interpretations come up...at work when I had
    printed out the piece in regular/smaller size, there seemed to be no confusion....&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Again, thanks for all the help and feedback <BR> <BR>-Frank
