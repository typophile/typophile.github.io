  However, I did find one via Google, called \"Switch\" from www.typecuts.com. \r\n\r\nAnyone
  else out there in Typophileland found any new unicase typefaces lately?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDylan\r\n\r\n"

    I'm hunting for something that doesn't exist. I might just go with \"Switch\"
    for now. It's very close to what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of new
    unicase typefaces that we've all missed, please post your links here!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nD\r\n\r\n_________________\r\nBuild
