  would like me to use. I know Futura is a close option, but I would love to know
  this specific face, for my client and to scratch my curiosity itch. Any ideas? \r\n\r\nThank
  you!  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/vivre-sa-vie-cover_5130.jpg]"

  body: "Lots of very similar typefaces, but I couldn\u2019t find a spot-on match.
    Best recommendation to recreate the look is Neutra Face No. 2 Text Bold (blunt
    the top of the |A| and the bottoms of the |V|s, and alter the angle of the stroke
    ends on the arms of the |s|):\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2\r\n\r\nAlso
    very close: Verlag Black by Hoefler and Co., Transat Black by Typetanic, Radikal
    by Nootype, and OL Eagle by Dennis Ortiz Lopez."

  body: Funny because was about to conclude "bespoke as almost everything coming from
    Criterion" but this /S rang me a bell. This is a commercial typeface and it's
    called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/resident/monod|Monod]] by Resident.

  body: "I so rarely run things through WhattheFont, because it almost never gives
    me a match.\r\n\r\nDamned if it didn\u2019t kick out Monod at the top of the list
    this time. Well done, Ryuk."
