  of tons of typography-related books from past centuries, check out <a href=\"http://books.google.com/\">Google
  Books</a>, if you haven't already. Most 20th century stuff remains under copyright
  protection, and thus a \"full view\" isn't available. But even as someone who spends
  a lot of time in online databases, I was pretty astonished at what's available in
  a full-text version. I wonder if links to a number of books could be assembled into
  a kind of virtual library for this Typophile.com?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/books_4279.jpg]"

    the covers WAY crooked - see this one for example. I mean, really! Not to mention
    some of the pages are grey and the contents page is on there three times. Must
    have had the night shift doing this one.\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0811833763&id=V2quaAc1DLEC&pg=RA%20"

    body: Yeah, and I noticed the contrast is lousy on a lot of the pages. Not to
      mention that these are (all, I think) PDFs with each page scanned as an image.
      So there's no searching once you've downloaded the PDF (Google seems to allow
      searching the text before its rendered as a PDF on the "client" side), and copying
      little excerpts isn't really possible. I.e., the scans are rough and "crude."
      But still a tremendous resource, and you can always print stuff out. My guess
      is that people either volunteer or are paid very little to do the scanning--
      it's got to be a labor of love. I don't think I'd enjoy standing by a scanner
      with thousands of old pages to scan. At least I assume it's done by hand, unless
      they have some kind of robots doing it.

  body: "I started searching through the old typography books a few months ago, but
    quickly realized that since I'm essentially ignorant about letterpress, much of
    this old stuff wasn't much help. Hopefully people who know will be able to sift
    out the good stuff for those of us who can't tell the difference. It hadn't occurred
    to me to look for lettering stuff, though, so I'll have to look through those.\r\n\r\nAccess
    to contemporary European works is great. I've actually cited Google's online edition
    of <em>Dutch Type</em> in school work, hopefully we'll see more.\r\n\r\nDon't
    forget to try Microsoft's <a href=\"http://books.live.com\">books.live.com. It
    has books Google doesn't (and vice-versa) and the interface is a little better."

  body: "It is by hand I think because on the last page for one book I was reading
    I saw a finger. A pink little pinky. \r\n\r\nI must say being able to search the
    texts of available books is mighty fine - it takes you right to the page the terms
    are located on.\r\n\r\nThe main downside for me has been that many many books
    are only partly scanned ( or partly available )  - at least for the terms I have
    searched for anyway."

    they didn't mention the utopian projects prior to WWII to do the same kind of

    the \"Mundaneum.\""
