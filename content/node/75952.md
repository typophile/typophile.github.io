  work with Chronicle & Whitney. I've been searching and searching, but haven't found
  anything that's suitable. The typeface in question would be used mainly for headlines
  and special features. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    might click with Chronicle in some ways eventually, but not with Whitney. So i
    ask you why did you suggest the three, what is you concept behind. Tell me. "

  body: "It all depends on the context in which @sulin intends to use it, so for all
    I know, my choices may not be \"English Script\" enough. Is this for a publication
    about business or weddings?  \r\n\r\nOne could argue that as a modern sans-serif,
    Whitney is philosophically opposed to any decorative font, but I felt it had enough
    historical 'soul' (as opposed to Helvetica neutrality) to live with any of my
    choices. \r\n\r\nWhat are your choices? "

    i'm always struggeling with scripts, particulary if they should contrast in a
    harmonious way \"in between\" different \"parameters\" like a serif and a sans
    situation."
