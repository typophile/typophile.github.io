body: I want to create a typeface (OTF) based upon the handwriting of my Grandmother.
  She has beautiful handwriting. What I am wondering is if there is some resource
  out there outlining a list of particular words or a paragraph, that I should have
  her write in order to understand the relationship between specific letters (i.e.
  ss, th, tt, ing, etc.). My thought is that there may be a paragraph (or more) of
  text that she can write down and that I can study in order to learn and create the
  typeface. Any insight on how I might go about starting this would be great! Thanks!
