  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><cite>A series of seventeen Didot fonts sized between 4.5 point and 21 points were founded using matrices supplied to Joh. Enschedé en Zonen (Netherlands)... </cite>

Above is an example from something I am working on.
Though both sizes are more than one, and hence plural, it would seem grammatically correct to say <strong>points</strong>.
I prefer <strong>point</strong> as it seems more modern and can exist with out the superfluous s on the end.

<strong>but</strong> why does it feel natural to use both in the same sentence. I could have just gone with one of the two options above but I thought I would see if anyone had an opinion on this.

So, I am proposing a style where in the <strong>first instance the singular</strong> is used and for the <strong>last instance in a sentence plural</strong>
BTW when I refer to points as a size of a type the number is a figure.

here is another example:

<cite>A ‘9 on 12 point body’ describes a type usual to a 9 point body which is cast onto a body three points larger.</cite>

Points to the inch has no bearing to my enquiry.

In my text, I am referring to real physical size (in the pre digital sense) therefore point or points...

This is not about how to describe a measurement but how to <strong>define</strong> points.

I'd think this distinction would also apply to type sizes.

The first size in your example, "4.5 point", is a specific size. The next, "21 points" is more of a general description than an exact dimension.

In the digital age call 'em what ever you like, they're just units.

		<div class="commentbody">I'd say it's a matter of nominal vs. adjectival forms. In adjectival forms with units of measure, you use the singular (e.g., "20-dollar bill"). When used as a noun, the unit of measure takes the plural with numbers other than one (e.g., "it costs 20 dollars"). So <em>A series of seventeen Didot fonts sized between 4.5 point and 21 points </em> is not correct, because both instances are functioning as nouns rather than adjectives, whereas <em>A ‘9 on 12 point body’ describes a type usual to a 9 point body which is cast onto a body three points larger</em> is correct, because it uses singular where the number plus unit function as an adjective modifying a noun, and plural where the unit is used as a noun.

It might be different sometimes in a language that has plural adjectives, assuming it allowed such constructions.

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Almost there. The shift to singular happens when the measure is part of a compound adjective that modifies a noun. Compound adjectives should also be hyphenated: a 3-inch nail, an 80-year-old man, 12-point type.

The measure stays plural if it's in a phrase on the other side of a verb. Then it's modifying an adjective. The actual adjective of the phrase is sometimes missing but implied: "The race is ten miles" really means "The race is ten miles <em>long.</em>"

Now, some fudging occurs when people start to think of a compound adjective as one that can be used where any other adjective can. Arguably, you can say "The type is 12-point" as easily as the "The type is black." But it's an unusual way to say things in most situations; we don't say "The race is ten-mile."

So let's look at your example.

"A series of fonts sized between 4.5 points and 21 points was founded."
("was", not "were", because the subject is "A series".) I would argue that the word "sized" demands this form. "This font is sized to 21 points" is like "This building was built 21 floors tall."

I think that use of "sized" is awkward anyway. I would say:
"A series of fonts between 4.5 points and 21 points in size was founded."

You could also say:
"A series of fonts from 4.5-point to 21-point was founded."
This treatment of adjectives is similar to that in such phrases as "all creatures great and small".

Above all, measurements listed together as the same part of speech should be in a consistent form, no matter how much more "specific" you think one number is than the other!

		<div class="commentbody">If developing a 'house-style' for usage do you think it would be good to differentiate between size (as dimension) and physical state?

[Updated from top] So far when referring to points as a 'physical state' of a (metal) type the number is a figure. [i.e. 7-point type]. (Is referred to in singular, and is hyphenated)

So with the convention of writing out numbers as words in running text helps identify a size (as dimension) [i.e. three points larger] clearly differentiating from the 'physical state' which uses a figure [i.e. 7-point type].

<cite>A ‘9 on 12-point body’ describes a type usual to a 9-point body which is cast onto a body three points larger.</cite>

Concerning sizes (as a dimension of scale)
<cite>...investigating features considered extraordinary or specific to the design of a typeface concerned with reproduction and legibility at sizes less than 7 points.</cite>
<strong>becomes</strong>
<cite>... and legibility at sizes less than seven points.</cite>

So taking two quotes (that I won't change in the text (as they are are quotes) but will apply the 'house-style' rules here for clarity are as follows:


<strong>Quote</strong>
<cite>The process was reversed for the large sizes, 18 points and larger, where legibility was not a problem and an aesthetic motive could apply.</cite>  [Walter Tracy]
<strong>would become</strong>
<cite>... for the large sizes, 18-point and larger, where legibility was not a problem and an aesthetic motive could apply. </cite>

<strong>Quote</strong>
<cite>Shorted descending and ascending strokes are unforgivable on bodies over 18 points. It is quite legitimate to shorten the tails of the small fonts [lowercase] to increase legibility and to lengthen them in the display size of the same face for the sake of elegance.</cite>  [Harry Carter] 
<strong>would become</strong>
<cite>...on bodies over 18-point.</cite> (as is descriptive of the physical body of type)

So far so good?</div>
