body: "I'm going to develop a new logo.\r\nDont know exactlly the name yet but its
  a pack product. Medical stuff packed in special packs.\r\nI did not develop nothing
  yet and decide to post for help not in develop something but to find pictures, photos,
  logos that have incorporated some \"pack\" style in the logo.\r\nDid not found many
  in my google search...but to get you an ideia  [[http://calpack.calpoly.edu/labequipement.html|here]]
  is a sample (not a good but what I found.)\r\nI also searched in brands of the world
  and didn\xB4t get many good results...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca"
