  \ (a great video and worthy of watching) and took note of how you described your
  Williams Caslon Text.  If I can paraphrase, how you believe the weight of individual
  glyphs need to dance around, how you don't want it too look even, but not predictably
  uneven either. You talk about this at about the 20 minute mark in the video.\r\n\r\nI
  wonder if the is any text out there describing this that you know of, I am very
  interested in this and would like to learn more."

    on my name?  :)  I did write a similar essay [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/11/02/reviving-caslon-part-2-readability-affability-authority/|Reviving
    Caslon, Part 2]] over at ilovetypography.com .\r\n\r\nYou'll see in the ilovetypography
    essay some of the visuals that illustrate my point about the need for both even
    rhythm and for variation or 'dance' (as Hrant has put it) that both gives a 'signal'
    to the eye of what letter it is, and keeps the face lively. I re-used some of
    those visuals in my slides in the talk. \r\n\r\nBut I'd be happy to go further
    into it, if you have further questions. "

  body: 'You can get the even rhythm with sans, but the ''dance'' part of it seems
    me to be more difficult. With seriffed fonts you have both the serifs and the
    thick-thin contrast to play with. This gives you a lot of scope to ''cheat'' this
    way and that to give more variety to the characters, so they have even color,
    but are quite varied. That seems to me more difficult with a sans. My feeling
    is that sans in general do not do so well in extended text, and this may be why.
    There are other issues, but that''s a start. But not having done a sans yet, I''m
    not the best one to say. '

  body: "Thing is though, because sans are often so geometrical and have such straight
    lines and less polymorphism between glyphs, sans fonts could use this effect a
    lot more than serif fonts do.  In fact I'm working on a face right now that is
    made up of all straight lines, and not straight lines so short that a sequence
    of them may be mistaken for curves, but straight lines that are meant to be seen
    as straight.  I find making the bottom of the O for example, slightly thicker
    than the top seems to take on this effect.\r\n\r\nI was hoping perhaps you came
    across this idea not from studying other typefaces, but perhaps read about it
    in some book somewhere."

  body: "I've learned about type first from reading my Uncle Ben Lieberman's old book,
    Types of Typefaces, which sparked my interest in it. Then from Tracy's Letters
    of Credit. Most of all by opening and comparing typefaces in FontLab, and then
    by drawing, drawing and comparing the effects of different variations of Caslon.
    And then from the folks at Font Bureau, especially David Berlow and Jill Pichotta.
    \r\n\r\nI think there's no way to really learn type design other than by drawing,
    looking and comparing over and over and over again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Well, I don''t think Serapion is a good text face, because it''s color is
    too uneven. You can get variety by doing uneven color, easily. To get variety
    while also getting even color to me is the challenge. Storm is a good designer,
    but to me this one is not a success. Large it''s ugly as well, if you ask me.
    To me it''s visually incoherent. '

  body: Well I'm really a display face maker, so I suppose we automatically look at
    faces differently from eachother to begin with.  However, have you ever actually
    read anything printed at text size in Serapion?  I haven't printed anything out
    with a laser printer or anything but when looking at it at 10 pt in Coreldraw,
    it's eccentricities seem to fade away a lot, and it actually seems quite comfortable
    to read, IMO, anyway.  I don't know how in the world Storm made that way off center
    counter in the g work, but to me, somehow, it seems to.

    should have a healthier attitude toward yourself, but because usually nobody listens
    to me, I don't want to push my luck!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to display type, subjective
    taste plays an even bigger role than text type, which is more constrained by readability
    demands. For example, I recognize the Victorian stuff, which tends to extremes,
    can be good, but I tend to like more classical taste. But I do like art deco.
    Whatever the style, though, I think visual coherence of the design is important.
    Any style is better than no style.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ryan, checking out Storm's site, your design looks a lot like Storm's Lexon.
    Biblion, which is his earlier and similar design was innovative in the way it
    succeeded in remaining legible at very small sizes, as I remember. Lexon is a
    bit less weird but still intended for reading at small sizes. Anselm is a design
    of his that is dialed back still further, and more traditional. \r\n\r\nI don't
    see any of these as good display faces, which you say is your goal, but this is
    a matter of personal taste. To me their quirkiness doesn't have the charm of a
    Cooper Black or much of Goudy's stuff. \r\n\r\nIn the case of your design, I don't
    think it's as well executed as in Storm, as, for example, the terminal on your
    r is too light in comparison with the a s c  and the design of your m and n are
    not as harmonious with the rest of the design as in Storm's Lexon. \r\n\r\nI think
    your design here is too close to Lexon for comfort. I think you should take what
    you've learned on this and try to get a new design idea that is less close to
    Lexon. Also I'm sure there are others who like these Storm designs for their aesthetic,
    and those who like them can probably give you better guidance on executing it
    well. Generally speaking, if you are going for quirky in a display\u2014and that
    can be very successful\u2014it should have cuteness or scariness or some other
    mood going for it. "

    the Storm site, and forgot about your earlier post. And I wrote the above before
    looking at the print out, because you said you wanted to do a display type, and
    I thought this was yours. I did look at the print-out later and was going to write
    that it is readable small, but looks kind of clunky and clotted also. I do still
    think it''s worse than the other designs I mentioned. I''m impressed at how Biblion
    works very, very small, but aside from that I don''t see the use of it. But I
    don''t like any of these related designs aesthetically. Yes, I think the whole
    lot of them are ugly. '
