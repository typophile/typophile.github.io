  body: It&#39;s an HP LaserJet 1200 &#40;w/ HCL 6 driver&#41;.  I found that the
    problem is directly based in the HCL 6 driver &#40;a problem that could be easily
    repaired if only I were allowed to install the fix, but alas it&#39;s a work printer,
    so only the official IT guys are allowed to go foolin&#39; around with such things&#41;--the
    whole thing gave me quite a scare, thinking I had done something stupid.
