body: "I'm a young designer/illustrator, and in this economy I know I can't afford
  to be too picky or ask for too much. I've been offered a job by a large stationery/gift
  packaging company that will be buying out the small company I currently work for.
  I'm lucky to even be offered a job as the majority of my coworkers have already
  been laid off at this point.\r\n\r\nI was offered a full-time salaried position
  nearly identical to the one I hold now, but at this point I think I would rather
  work as an independent contractor, negotiate a higher hourly rate and purse other
  freelance and personal projects at the same time. I currently feel like I am underpaid
  and would like to ask for more. However, I don't want to alienate the new management
  so I am worried about asking for too much.\r\n\r\nI know you don't know my exact
  situation but what would you do if you were in my shoes, my savvy fellow designers?\r\n\r\n"

  body: My advice is - take the full-time position while building up your freelance
    client base on the side. Then, when you have enough clients and leads make the
    jump. This is what I did back in 2000. Unless you're incredibly good at selling
    yourself, marketing and networking - which most designers aren't that great at,
    myself included - it will be tough getting new business right now in this economy.
    Good luck.

    may not be as much as you think your design is worth. Hopefully you could keep
    a few solid paying clients on the side if you can handle that and the full-time
    position. '

  body: "I have one ongoing freelance project currently and another strong lead for
    some freelance work that would require travel (although I'm not sure how consistent
    it would be). I am also trying to open my own design studio and build up a collection
    of illustration and design available for licensing. To really pursue my leads,
    I need more flexibility. On top of that, I already work from home and the offer
    with this stationery company is only guaranteed through September as the companies
    merge and transition. After September they could cut me loose or keep me. \r\n\r\nTo
    me it makes sense to contract and have my hand in other pursuits, but I guess
    I could be wrong. And again, I'm not sure what kind of hourly compensation to
    ask for if I do. "

  body: "Best advice I can give you is NEVER fear you're asking too much. More often
    than not, if you're at the point where you're discussing salaries, they want you,
    and will do their best to come to an agreeable salary.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a graphic
    designer, throughout your career you will likely work for a company, miss freelancing,
    so then eventually quit and freelance, then miss the paycheck and benefits, so
    will then go back to work for a company, and then repeat that for 40 years or
    so."

  body: "Julia, I think that Chris K. and aluminum have both given you some good advice...\r\n\r\nI
    understand that as a freelance graphic designer, you can charge between 80 and
    100 an hour, but I have no idea what an illustrator would charge.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if this is of any help, AIGA and Aquent conduct a yearly salary survey among designers...
    The latest one is <a href=\"http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/salary-survey\">here</a>."

  body: I think Chris Keegan's advice sounds good. Stay with the full-time job. You
    can always go freelance later. If you quit now, go freelance and it doesn't work
    out, it might be more difficult to get a full-time position again.

  body: "Given the economy, I would stick with the stationery job as long as possible
    while writing up a business plan, designing promotional materials, and networking.
    I would also spend a lot of time researching what kind of rates other local designers
    charge and find out if those rates are profitable, and consider whether you can
    survive on lower rates in a year when there are more freelancers competing and
    businesses have less to spend.\r\n\r\nAs for asking for more money, be very careful
    unless research shows that you are VERY underpaid. They can probably just drop
    you and hire a desperate laid-off designer/illustrator to work for even less,
    so you\u2019d better have a lot to bring to the table when you start that negotiation."

  body: Not too keen on offering advice, but having a reliable safety net in place
    seems wisest. Chris Keegan nails it re freelance-on-the-side and, typically, Ricardo's
    advice on salary summary is spot on. Banking on a swift economic turnaround would
    be foolhardy to say the least.

  body: 'Never make your employer believe that you would be prepared to work for less
    money or that you would think your work would not be worth more than the company
    is paying for it. Asking for a lot more money and then simply staying at the company
    with your present salary is not a credible option either. So maybe proposing to
    discuss your salary based on your qualifications,  your actual work and responsibilities,
    and the economic situation of the company is the way to go, and leaves you several
    options how to proceed based on their response. -- cs '
