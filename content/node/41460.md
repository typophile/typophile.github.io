body: "Hi there!\r\nHere i am again... \r\nWell i started to do my own font, now i'm
  with a problem. When i save it shows some strange lines on the glyph.\r\nI'm most
  certain that is because i have two paths on the same glyph. I've done two or more
  paths so it could be easier to bezier. Can anyone tell me how to join both paths
  into one? or do i have to take the paths to mask and bezier on top?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJoel
  Santos"

  body: "You might not want to Merge Contours if you want to be able to easily tweak
    characters along the way. I usually only merge right before I'm generating a otf/ttf
    (and not save it afterwards).\r\n\r\nUsually setting PS Direction on paths solves
    the overlap. If not, you can manually choose 'Reverse Contours' from the right
    click menu on any shape."

  body: "I'm with Q on this one - I have seen some real benefits to leaving contour
    merging (a.k.a. overlap removal) to the end as a near-final step in generating
    the output font. This is especially true if you're working in MM space, and/or
    going to be doing italics that will start out with modifying the roman.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
