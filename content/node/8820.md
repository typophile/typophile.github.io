body: i am by no means a type designer. i don&#39;t pretend that this is good or useful.
  <BR>i was messing around trying to force glyphs into an 8x10 grid, just an excersize
  <BR>in solving problems created by strict guidelines. i sort of cheated when i created
  <BR>some diagonal shapes, but hey, they were my rules to begin with. so i was wondering
  <BR>whether anyone had some different solutions to some of the more <BR>obvious
  &#40;or boring&#41; problems. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6367.gif"

  body: why thank you, i think ;&#41;  <BR>some of the glyphs in the sample text got
    squashed somehow,  <BR>so ignore those. the second Q is a cheater with the tail
    poking  <BR>out of the grid. the glyphs with diagonals are the ones that are  <BR>giving
    me the most problems. <BR>very cool grid system, by the way bj.

    sizes?

  body: i don&#39;t think it does too well any smaller than &#43;/- 30 pts. <BR>i
    started breaking the grid when i had to make a poster <BR>that emulated an historic
    type/design style. i was doing <BR>constructivism, but i didn&#39;t have a lot
    of time to do more <BR>than slap together some glyphs. <BR> <BR>does anyone have
    an opinion on m or n? i&#39;m also dithering <BR>quite a bit on b. my wife actually
    art directed b#5 and q#1. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6370.gif"

  body: 'Isaac: &#40;1&#41; Of the Xs, I&#39;d say I prefer the first. The other 3
    look like they&#39;re wrapped around an orb. Which could be cool - but in my mind
    it doesn&#39;t make sense with rest of the letters. &#40;2&#41; The first 2 Bs
    I think are less successful than the others because of the extreme&#40;?&#41;
    variation in their strokes. &#40;3&#41; Are the Zs on the same grid? They look
    wider. &#40;4&#41; You might think of adding square/slab-type serifs in the &#39;I.&#39;
    <BR> <BR>Overall I think it&#39;s a great start. Why is it that you&#39;re bothered
    by the diagonals exactly? And I&#39;m with bj: The W is rockin&#39; like Dokken.
    <BR> <BR>Cheers, mate.'
