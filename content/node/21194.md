  on western beers in Russia mentions Heineken's Champions League advertising campaign
  that used a made up brand \"ChapionsPlanet\" to circumvent French laws on liquor
  advertising. The fictional brand uses the distinctive Heine font and colour scheme.
  \r\n\r\nThis kind of thing has been going on for years in Formula 1 (<A HREF=\"http://www.sporteconomy.it/files/image/foto2005/midlandf1(1).jpg\">example</A>)
  to avoid tobacco advertising bans. I've always thought this practice shows the power
  of typography, and would make for a great magazine article, coffee table book or
  undergraduate dissertation subject. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any interesting examples
  of this genre they\u2019d care to share?     \r\n"

    a bland beer like Bud when they can get a fine beer from Munich?\r\nBud is wiser
    for opening up the American Hispanic market though.  There are many very serious
    World Cup fans here amomng Spanish speakers in the U.S., Central, and South America.\r\nI
    really like the Slovak Pilsner. Try it if you get the chance.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
