  he supposedly gave in Paris shortly after Rotis was released.\r\n\r\nHe seems to
  have claimed that Rotis bridges the difference between catholic and protestant,
  or something like that. Anyone heard of it? Anyone knows of printed sources?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTim"

    and protestants who hate Rotis."

    Otl Aicher show at the Herb Lubalin Study Centre which took place in Nov/Dec 2000,
    which you are welcome to. Email me your address at ben [underscore] archer [at]
    me [dot] com and I'll mail it to you \u2013 it's only A3. It mentions Rotis of
    course, as aiming to reconcile the serif and sans serif traditions, but no other
    bridge-crossings or boundary-blurrings are hinted at."
