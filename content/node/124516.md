  creative.\r\n\r\nSans serif looks  similar to Oswald, but the 'R' is distinctly
  different. http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oswald\r\n\r\nSerif fairly close to
  Egyptienne MN Condensed Bold. http://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/Egyptienne+MN+Condensed+Bold/\r\n\r\nCan't
  quite nail it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\n"
