  like a lot of the folks around here.\r\n\r\nSo I've recently been considering taking
  on the task of designing and setting an internal marketing handbook for Chick-fil-a.
  It's still in the bidding and discussion process, so I'm not positive I'll get the
  job, but it got me thinking.\r\n\r\nChick-fil-a uses Weiss for the majority of their
  printed materials. It looks all right, but it seems like a little bit of a strange
  choice. Do you think it's intended to look more upscale than other fast-food restaurants?
  Give a nod to their history? What would drive the choice of a fast food chain to
  select such an elegant typeface? Do you feel it works well?\r\n\r\nAnd further,
  should I stick to Weiss for their materials design? I'll have flexibility in this,
  and I don't know that Weiss seems the best choice. I imagine it has the flexibility
  for both headlines and body text, but as something that will be used in a manual
  day-in and day-out, is it a little too inaccessible?\r\n\r\nAnd if so, how far should
  I allow myself to deviate from their standard typographic choice?\r\n\r\n(This could
  all be for naught as it could end up that there are guidelines I'll need to stick
  to that the person who pitched the product is unaware of.)\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  help you could give me."

    their ID with KFC, for instance, Chick-Fil-A feels more akin to Marie Calendar
    than KFC. A little less fast food.\r\n\r\nI, personally, would stick with Weiss. "

  body: "I too would stick with Weiss as much as possible. Especially for headlines,
    titles, etc. A manual can be very text heavy so I would use a sans-serif for any
    body copy. Something that compliments Weiss but will be easier to read in large
    chunks at a small size.\r\n\r\nSince this sounds like a freelance or contract
    type of job, & it's for an internal piece, they're not really asking for a complete
    re-design of their materials. But making it look a little cleaner while using
    some of their existing brand standards would be a good goal."

    a little to the possible motivations they could have had for choosing Weiss.\r\n\r\nI'll
    take these into heart with the project for sure!"
