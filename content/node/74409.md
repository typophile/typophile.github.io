    -- I mean, yes, the client application has to know what's what. InDesign, for
    example, got updated to the most recent Unicode tables somewhere between CS and
    CS4. In the older version, using a trick like \"All Caps\" (as text attribute)
    or \"Change case to Uppercase\" didn't work for all characters one would expect.
    In CS4, at least, it does.\r\n\r\n<cite>A side question: if the relationship between
    upper and lowercase is informed by Unicode, how to handle pairs of glyphs with
    no codepoint? Say, Gtilde and gtilde or Eacutedotbelow and eacutedotbelow. As
    they are out of Unicode specification, will the client program or OS understand
    their upper/lowercase relation?</cite>\r\n\r\nNope. If you go over a glyph list
    in Unicode order, you will see there is no apparent relation between the Unicodes
    for lowercase and uppercase. As an aside, since these values are defined in the
    Unicode table, un-encoded (private) characters can not have such a relation with
    each other, per definition.\r\n\r\nI <em>think</em> \"All Caps\" (the text attribute)
    may be using a 'case' Opentype table when present, because it also converts regular
    accents to 'uppercase' accents, which are definitely *not* in the Unicode list.
    \r\n\r\n.. Okay, just tested it with Minion Pro: the acute accent gets translated
    to an uppercase variant when using \"All Caps\" (the 'case' case), but not when
    using a manual \"Change to Uppercase\"."

  body: Thanks Theunis. But how I can associate through OT code two uncoded glyphs?
    As you pointed, "All caps" commands will work due to OT classes and features.
    But simple convertions to/from UC/lc will not.

  body: OpenType features do not depend on Unicode. In FontLab (and the AFDKO), feature
    code is based on glyph names. (I'm sure this is true in VOLT, too, but I've never
    used it.) Ultimately, in the actual font, after it's been compiled, it's based
    on the glyph index. If we couldn't reference unencoded glyphs in OT code, we'd
    be in big trouble.

  body: Thanks, Mark. But how to handle plain upper and lower case using OT features?
    This does not fits smcp, c2sp or pcap. Am I missing something about the case feature?

  body: Well, the <code>case</code> feature is intended for something called "case-sensitive
    forms". The most common use is for punctuation (such as hyphens and bullets),
    which is normally centered on the x-height. When the <code>case</code> feature
    is enabled, such as when "change case to all caps" is invoked, then the punctuation
    is centered on the caps instead (usually using glyph substitution). It certainly
    seems possible to use this to cause unencoded lowercase glyphs to be substituted
    with unencoded uppercase glyphs, but you may need to educate users to select "change
    case to all caps" for the proper result. Some common contexts (such as the caps-lock
    key and the shift key) will not, unfortunately, invoke the <code>case</code> feature.
