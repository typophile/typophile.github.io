  body: "It looks like a hand-drawn version of a Tuscan typeface. With no duplicate
    letters it's hard to say if it's a font, but judging from the uneven nature of
    the lettering I guess this is just drawn letters. Of course if you have more samples,
    I may have to reconsider.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
