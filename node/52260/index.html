  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone, 
I&rsquo;m in awe of the the accumulated typography skill, knowledge and taste assembled on this board, so I&rsquo;m asking sorta nervously for you to critique a design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m entering a competition to desgn a logo for a nearby neighborhood&rsquo;s summer festival. Here is the challenge, as it appeared in my email:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&quot;White Center's &quot;Jubilee Days&quot; is looking to update its identity for 2009 to more reflect its community. White Center is the most diverse community in the greater Seattle area, having 80 cultures, speaking 50 different languages. I would like to see that spoken to in the logo.

What is needed on the logo-
 Name: White Center Jubilee Days
 Theme: Living the dream
 Date: July 19th &amp; 20th 2009

The logo will be used on T-shirts, banners, buttons, and all related printed material.

I am accepting black and white roughs to start with. I will then select 3 finalists and ask for full color versions.

As an artist myself I realize the amount for work that goes into creating an identity....&quot;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

White Center is anything but White, as the man says. The present community leadership is looking to turn the gritty and tough identity into friendly international pride.

The theme &quot;Living the dream&quot; refers to Martin Luther King's &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech. It sure is not the &quot;American Dream,&quot; as this hood has probably the lowest per capita income in the area.

Below are some previous Jubilee logos - to give you an idea how truly bad were the graphics before someone realized this kind of thing wouldn't improve their image.   
![](/images/old-images/JD-buttons-s_6206.jpg)
Looks like generic Balloon and Brush Script, doesn't it?

Here is my black and white design:
![](/images/old-images/jubilee-logo-solo_4626.gif)
Here is how it might look on a tee shirt:
![](/images/old-images/jubilee-logo-bw-tee_5752.gif)

I wanted to represent typographically the many cultures in this area, especially Thai, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Latino, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Arabic as well as African-American.

I felt the type needed to be &quot;foreign-looking&quot; and eccentric, yet still quite legible at a distance and to someone who has learned English as a second language. 

Critique away...

1.The image in the center represents a Native American &quot;sky basket&quot; bronze sculpture on a tall pole at the gateway to this hood, just dedicated last year. 

2. The words &quot;White Center&quot; and the date are in a font identified only as &quot;Dingaling Bold&quot; in my folder. I have no idea where it came from or its true identity - please help me out here. Obviously I tweaked the font to make the &quot;Thai&quot; circles, but the W is the original W, although it resembles a Russian &quot;sha&quot;. Because the phrase has no descenders, I thought an arch would be attractive.

3. The Words &quot;Jubilee Days&quot; are in Nick's font &quot;Yo Quiero Taquitos,&quot; but I reversed the descender on the Y to resemble a Cambodian character. 

4. The words &quot;Living the Dream&quot; are in a font called &quot;Jive Talk&quot;.

THANKS in advance!! </code></pre></div>

Hmm. Usually Typophiles are so opinionated. I can only surmise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The design sucks so bad you don&rsquo;t know where to start, and don&rsquo;t wanna hurt my feelings by telling me to delete it and start from scratch</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The design is so brilliant no one can add a single suggestion for improvement, and y&rsquo;all are jealous</li>

<li>My choice of fonts offends your professional sensibilities</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Or we&rsquo;re digesting what we&rsquo;re seeing before we start critiquing&hellip; :-)</p>
<p>First thought: Not enough unity. Community, although we often celebrate our differences and diversity, is ultimately about being united. The design right now just isn&rsquo;t communicating that, it&rsquo;s too disparate and not unified enough. And the flower and sun graphics look too clip-arty. If they&rsquo;re going to be integral to the design, integrate them. The text should be more unified and they shouldn&rsquo;t be 3 different typefaces. Anyway that&rsquo;s my first thoughts. I&rsquo;ll have more suggestions later as time permits.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I would suggest taking one or maybe two font families and use it throughout the design (using different weights to create rhythm and differentiation). But feel free to add little tweaks to the letter shapes that suggest the diverse cultural influences of the community. Also the tagline &ldquo;Living the dream&rdquo; needs to be integrated with the rest of the design. Right now its it&rsquo;s own separate design and competes for attention in a distracting manner. Perhaps the words &ldquo;White Center&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jubilee Days&rdquo; should form a circle around the tagline which would help incorporate the tagline into the design.</div>

<p>The hibiscus flowers and sun are repositioned to flow into the design better. The sun is a Native American sun, and the flowers symbolize the native Hawaiian and Samoan communities, a big part of the festival. They would recognize that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>eliason: thanks for the feedback. &ldquo;Living the Dream&rdquo; looks like an irregular arc, I suppose, because of the &ldquo;g&rdquo; descender and the original font&rsquo;s uneven baseline. I will try to smooth it out, using a curve as a guide.</p>
<p>Jupiterboy: I have not dismissed the advice. I did eliminate one typeface. Now I have &ldquo;Yo Quiero Taquitos&rdquo; as the base for the first three phrases, though I added the international details.</p>
<p>I did use a different font for the numbers because the numbers in YQT were extremely square and didn&rsquo;t seem to go with the letters. I wanted the zeros to be perfectly circular, to &ldquo;thai&rdquo; in with the circles in the lettering.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>You asked, where are the international references? They are listed below. I see these forms on signage every time I walk around White Center. 

1.The circles in the type are from Thai lettering. 

2. The reversed curl and sharp angle on the y's descender in &quot;Days&quot; resembles Cambodian lettering. 

3. A (Spanish) tilde instead of a dash in &quot;19-20&quot;. 

4. The stripes and zigzags as well as the decorative ends on &quot;Jubilee Days&quot; are Mexican or Guatemalan.  

5. The dots over &quot;i&quot; are turned into lozenge shapes reminiscent of the diamonds in Arabic lettering. Anyway they are &quot;foreign,&quot; not English.

6. The hibiscus flower which some of you disliked is a symbol of the Samoan and Hawaiian cultures. That is iconic for them.

7. The sun is a Native American shape - this is the way it's stylized by tribes in the Pacific northwest.
</code></pre><p>If I have to explain all that, maybe it isn&rsquo;t working. But I think the people in this hood will recognize those things.</p>
<p>The challenge for me is to incorporate these details into English type so they say &ldquo;charmingly foreign and eccentric&rdquo; - but still very legible. That is why it helps so much to have fresh pairs of eyes critiqueing the lettering.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback, it&rsquo;s helping.</p>
