  body: "There are actually quite a few similar styles that you can find by searching
    at MyFonts.com using \"narrow hand-drawn\" as the search keywords. I did not see
    this exact font, but this style could easily also be amateur work on one of the
    free download sites.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
