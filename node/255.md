  monday and <BR>tuesday fonts! oops! A dangerous game I&#39;m playing.  <BR> <BR>I
  moved in a different direction from Neweue Helpetica. I was feeling like it was
  too close <BR>to helvetica and others. Simply adding a few alternate letterforms
  would not do. I haven&#39;t <BR>totally scrapped what I was up to. If there&#39;s
  a  <BR>major outcry, I will keep working on it. <BR> <BR>So now I have a complete
  upper and lower case for a new font. But, I think the caps are a  <BR>hair too dark
  for the text! Overall though I like the flair of this one. A few things are still
  there:  <BR>notably the k. Stay tuned for a glyph chart. <BR> <BR>Randy '

    are the caps too dark for the lower case? Right now the caps are 112% heavier

    need a nice laser printer if i&#39;m going to get serious about this. I&#39;ve

  body: I whole-heartedly agree with earlier posts that this effort warrants further
    work... congratulations! Based upon my first and immediate reaction, I prefer
    the second of the three lower case &#34;a&#39;s&#34;. And one other observation
    &#40;that may be due to my failure to renew a prescription more than keen typographic
    analysis&#41; is that the vertical strokes of some upper case characters seem
    to bow out more than the normal optical illusion. They bring to mind jfp&#39;s
    brilliant suggestion for the &#34;y&#34; diagonal strokes in the recently posted
    yesyes logo. Again, congratulations.

    a bit too straight at the bottom, when the g horizontal is more curvy. <BR> <BR>The

    make asymmetrical traps using the Flower by revolving the new corner point along
    its circle, to the desired spot. Also, you can compensate for greater bleed in

    love them. To me the only reason not to have it descending is for display work,

    though&#41;. Some people say that a descending &#34;J&#34; doesn&#39;t really
    help spacing, since it rarely occurs except as the first letter of a word/name
    - but of course that&#39;s a highly Anglo view - type designers from LJUBLJANA
