    from now&#41; we&#39;re gathering for an impromptu meet and  <BR>greet at a &#42;yet-to-be
    named cafe in Emeryville, California.  <BR>Just across the Bay bridge from SF.
    <BR> <BR>Come. Buy yourself lunch. Hang out and chat with other  <BR>typophiles.
    Get your tee you&#39;ve waited ages for. If we coerce  <BR>Graham Hicks to come
    you can make him sign your shirt  <BR>that he designed. &#42;&#42;BYOS. <BR> <BR>So
    far the tentative guest list is: <BR> <BR>Jared Benson <BR>Joe Pemberton <BR>Stephen
    Coles <BR>Cheshire Dave <BR>Christopher Simmons <BR>... <BR> <BR>How about you
    other Bay Area kids? <BR>Rob  <BR>Graham <BR>Dan <BR>Aaron <BR>Dana  <BR> <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Cheshire, any recommendations for a good place <BR>to eat? I only live
    there, I never dine there. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Bring your own Sharpie.'

  body: OK - Decisions decisons.  <BR> <BR>Do I cut my Java programming class to attend
    this once in a lifetime event, or do I stay and try and get caught up on a class
    I&#39;m already behind in? <BR> <BR>As to meeting actual font people in person,
    will this quell my burgeoning fontaholism or enrage an already expanding desire
    to unparalleled proportions furthter alienating me from my family and friends?
    <BR> <BR>Questions, questions. <BR> <BR>~ Roballoo!

    of my Saturday Java class to join you folks ~ a rare &#40;live&#41; chance to
    fontificate over typographical matters of the heart. <BR> <BR>I will see YOU there.

    wear both, even though they don&#39;t make good pants.

    Hope this wasn&#39;t the last bay area typo-gathering. I&#39;ll be sure to set
    two alarm clocks for the next one!

    his site</a>. <BR> <BR>Left to right it&#39;s Jesse &#40;is he picking my pocket?&#41;,
    me, then  <BR>Graham Hicks, Jared Benson, Jim Parkinson, Roballoo and  <BR>Cheshire
    Dave. Oh, and can&#39;t forget Chesh&#39;s girlfriend,  <BR>behind the camera.
    <BR> <BR>Not pictured is Stephen who showed up two hours late, at  <BR>Jared&#39;s.
    He had enough time to watch a classic Twilight  <BR>Zone episode starring a mysterious
    Linotype. <BR> <BR>The funnest part was sitting in the cafe, watching <BR>strangers
    come in and speculating whether they were  <BR>typophiles or regular customers.
    The biggest surprise <BR>was Oakland resident, Jim Parkinson who dropped in.

    the rollover alt tags.   <BR> <BR>Although the alt-tags ain&#39;t showing up on
    my Mac ~ they are on the PC side of things and I&#39;d hate to confuse our PC
