<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I spent the last few days over in the Netherlands at a design event the town of Groninger. Not only was it an excellent event and a chance to meet up with Donald Beekman and Max Kisman, but on the way back I got the chance to stop off in Amsterdam. <br> <br>Unusually for an Englishman in Amsterdam I didn't head straight for the red light district of the Hash bars, but straight for the cities excellent design book stores. WOW! <br> <br>House Industries, have you got your hands on a copy of this book yet, full of Humour fonts and there story, and Dutch Type which is going to keep me reading for weeks (and features both Beekman and Kisman). <br> <br>Has anyone got either of these books, what did you think? <br> <br>Jim <br>=== <br> <br>You can read a few words about the Groninger design event I wrote for a English design magazine here : <a href=http://www.hellofonts.com/dutch.html target=_blank>http://www.hellofonts.com/dutch.html</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have Dutch Type. <br> <br>While I don't care for Kisman and Beekman, the focus of the <br>book is thankfully all inclusive. I'm sure a few were missed, <br>but the collection of Dutch type designers is exhausting. <br>I could go on, but the major players all have great features <br>that often include original sketches, specimens and excerpts <br>from exlcusive interviews with the author. Nice, because <br>many times the work of these designers is only shown with <br>repeat FF specimens or well worn publicity promos. <br> <br>The focus on the complete spectrum of dutch type designers is <br>especially commendable, even the really young and unpublished <br>Arnhem students. <br> <br>Additionally, cultural and educational influences are discussed <br>in small 1 to 3 page sections between many of the chapters. <br>For instance, the Gerrit Noordzij influence, the Arnhem students etc. <br> <br>Also, I'd be interested to hear reactions from readers of the book <br>after reading 320 pages of Peter Verheul's new Versa. <br>I found myself really liking it.</div>
