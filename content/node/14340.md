  body: "Actually, this it looks like the URW version which incorporated the alternate
    N and M into their italic. This stationary was set before the P22 Lanston revivals
    were released. Now it's more of a question of which to choose for resetting it...
    \r\n\r\nWhich is the \"better\" Deepdene when set somewhere around 9 pt? I haven't
    looked at the P22 Lanstons closely and am just downloading the pdf catalog now."

  body: URW's version seems to be a bit more italicized and it has a little less contrast.
    I would choose Lanston's for both the more upright italic as well as the fact
    that they are probably a little more faithful to the original. But that's just
    me.
