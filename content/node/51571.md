  body: I think it's not your eyes that are old but this object might be. If it's
    pre-1990, odds are it was created with film fonts, not digital fonts, or hand
    drawn. But the differences from <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/futura_std_bold/?sample_text=ZERO&sample_size=96">Futura
    Bold</a> are minor.
