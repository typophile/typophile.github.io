“Based on” is very relative. If you’re thinking about modifying some letters, I’d talk to the foundry or type designer in question. On the other hand, creating something brand new <em>in the same vein</em> as a previous design is what type designers do all day. I wouldn’t worry about that.</p>

<p>When screenplays were written with typewriters (roughly similar to 12pt Courier font) in &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; format, each page of play was roughly equivalent to 1 minute of action, which is why Courier (or Courier Final Draft) is still the default font for writing screenplays in this format. I think FreeMono would be a pretty good free alternative, but at some point we might want to commission a font called Courier X for product X that competes with Final Draft to match the competition. I&rsquo;m just wandering how much that would cost?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">To get estimates, you’ll probably need to contact foundries directly. You’ll also need some more details: technical level, timeframe, character set, weights, styles, level of exclusivity etc. OEM licensens are often priced as a percentage of the end product retail price. An exclusive design might mean a higher one time fee upfront, but on the other hand no running expenses. You could also deviate in style within the same widths and metrics as Courier, giving your product X a unique voice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Pat2, I&rsquo;ve been told that if your screenplay is not in Courier, those in the movie and TV business won&rsquo;t even look at it. So I think you are stuck with something that doesn&rsquo;t look much different. One thing one could do—or I could do—is make it more a robust weight than Courier New, without artificial roughness. You might ask Nick Shinn whether he could whip you up a monospace version of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/bodoni-egyptian-pro/regular/|Bodoni Egyptian,]] which might look fresh and still pass.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, I know he can&rsquo;t change Courier noticeably. But being more robust can be done without changing how it sets or page count. Since it&rsquo;s monospaced, it&rsquo;s not exactly rocket science to get it to space <em>exactly</em> the same: just set all the characters to the same number as Courier. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s a feat of creativity, but it might look a little nicer and still be Courier.</p>
<p>Just checking: I see that with my copy of Movie Magic&rsquo;s Screenwriter program there came a special &ldquo;screenwriter&rdquo; version of Courier, which is substantially heavier than New Courier, and with higher x-height, and almost the same monospace width—1233 instead of 1227 (they are both true type fonts.)</p>
<p>So it seems that my original suggestion was exactly on target. Movie Magic&rsquo;s Screenwriter and Final Draft, which are the two most widely used programs for screen play writing I would guess have done similar things in producing their own versions of Courier. I could do the same for Pat2, who started this thread.</p>
<p>And yes, I&rsquo;ve written a screen play. Just ask me about it :)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be too scientific :) People don&rsquo;t care about the x-height,  why the monospace width is 1233 instead of 1227. No one  is going to  talk about that.  No one is going to think that  this font &ldquo;&hellip;might look a little nicer&rdquo;&hellip;. This is not important.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, height of the caps are not that different, between Courier New and Courier Screenwriter, but if you do the same exercise for the lower case, it is a lot different, as well as noticeably darker. I think the difference anyone will notice when they are side by side.</p>
<p>Your example of Courier Final Draft looks darker in the screen capture in FontLab, but for some reason not in your sample. I don&rsquo;t have your &ldquo;Courier&rdquo; with no other identity on my machine, so I can&rsquo;t check the lower case of that or the Final Draft one.</p>
<p>The point of my giving the numbers is that the set width is almost identical, but the lower case looks a lot bigger and darker. So it is OK as far as the 1 page per minute rule. But it looks a lot different on the page, and I think the darker and bigger look of Courier Screenwriter is better for use in a screenplay.</p>
<p>My understanding is that Pat2 has a new screenwriting program and wants to have his own proprietary version of Courier for it, rather than buying one from a competitor. So it can&rsquo;t be too different and meet the needs, but it can be a little different, and better in small ways, and certainly as good as the versions in Final Draft or Movie Magic Screenwriter.</p>
