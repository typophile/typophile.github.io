    seen anything of theirs that would mimic the &#34;We the People&#34;?  I could
    definitely be mistaken, though.&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65106.jpg"

  body: Liana, You&#39;re right. Marc&#39;s answer was more about the other script,
    so actually was not responsive to the original post request, if that&#39;s what
    Chris really wanted. <BR> <BR>Yves, I don&#39;t think this one should be closed
    yet. I think something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/duc-de-berry/duc-de-berry/testdrive.html?s=We+the+People&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Duc De Berry</a> comes closer to &#39;We the People&#39;
