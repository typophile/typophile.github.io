  have 21 years and come from Serbia.Ok my question in subject refers that there are
  only 3 fonts for serious mathematical work:Computer Modern,Euler,and that new Microsoft
  font.Why is that,is it because most of the people don''t care about math so there
  isn''t demand on market or what.   '

    (my dad's a math prof) but I'm sure there are special metrics outside of the kerning
    and substitution tables that I really don't have a clue how to set up.  If anyone
    has information on how to do it I'd love to know!\r\n\r\nBut, as you note, there
    just really isn't a demand for it.  The original one was intended as a be-all
    end-all font of sorts, and its served its function so well there just hasn't been
    demand to change it.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas

    the new Office math engine please drop me a line. We held a Math font workshop
    at TypeCon last year and have shared specs with interested parties.

  body: "Well the original one was designed to be a be-all-end-all font, and it's
    hard to find any fault in its designed from a math user's perspective.  All characters
    are easily recognizable without context from other letters, all the necessary
    variations, sizing concerns etc.  But it was also done after lots of research
    into previous font designs.  Donald Knuth, the author of the font, has an excellent
    write up on his design process in (<em>Computers and Typsetting</em>, vol. E).
    \ I read it years ago and so have forgotten most of the details, but needless
    to say, he created a more or less definitive standard for design.\r\n\r\nAnd along
    those lines, because it is so well made and, let's be honest, a niche market,
    people aren't looking for variety.  When scientists can't be bothered to hire
    illustrators and designers to do their figures and instead leave it to Excel,
    do we really think they're going to go the distance and buy new fonts?  Because
    of that, and the large amount of work involved in creating and testing a font,
    it's just not something most people want to put the work into.  It falls much
    into the lines of what Thomas Phinney has been talking about with the new Adobe
    Latin charset.\r\n\r\nRemember, a math font needs to have regular, italic, bold,
    struck, and fraktur and combinations therewithin.  Also it needs some Hebrew and
    very carefully designed combining diacritics and a full set of sub/superscript
    variants and even better to have double-script variants.  And there is now the
    OpenType method of defining metrics as used by Word (which honestly seems like
    the more logical approach, I know, surprising that Word would take a logical approach
    to something) and the method I sitll need to look into for **TeX.  \r\n\r\nAll
    in all it's a lot of work for a small market.  The only reason I'm doing it is
    because of my dad and I figure I can convince his department to use it (mathematicians
    can be surprisingly well convinced on things like this).\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro

    perspective\r\n\r\nYes, but from a type design point of view, many of the glyphs
    are a bit faulty (most lack any sort of optical correction). This is where you
    see the main difference between a font done by a mathematician and a font done
    by a real type designer (compare Computer Modern and Cambria for example).\r\n\r\n<cite>people
    aren\u2019t looking for variety</cite>\r\n\r\nWhile most mathematicians don't
    care which font they use, in the last few years quite a few math fonts have been
    developed (see the [[http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/Free_Math_Font_Survey/survey.html|Free
    Math Font Survey]] for an overview of the free ones) so those who do want to use
    other fonts can, although the choice is still rather limited.\r\n\r\n<cite>the
    method I still need to look into for **TeX.</cite>\r\n\r\nMath specific metrics
    are stored into TeX's own format, TFM (TeX File Metric). Making TFM files for
    math fonts is a bit technical. The first problem is that there are very few ways
    of generating them (the only ways I know of are metafont, fontinst, [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/PfaEdit-TeX.html|fontforge]]
    and by hand). The second is that you need to test the fonts, so you must have
    a TeX distribution installed and have enough knowledge to install your new fonts
    (not so easy: there's more involved than putting the files into a directory; but
    once you know how to do it, it's not difficult).\r\n\r\nYou can find a technical
    description of the TFM font format in Yannis Haralambous' book [[http://books.google.com/books?id=qrElYgVLDwYC|Fonts
    and Encodings]] from O'Reilly.\r\n\r\nIf you're really up to it and don't mind
    all the technical hassle of the process, I should probably be able to answer most
    of your questions on the subject."

    but come to think of it, a handwritten style math font, maybe one mimicking Erd\u0151s's
    handwriting, would be kind of neat.  Now that'd be a huge font file with 7 or
    so variations on every single math character. \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una
