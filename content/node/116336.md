body: "I have created c2sc, smcp and swsh features which all work as they should.
  However, when applying the smcp together with the swsh, the two ligatures for n_g.swsh
  and h_y.swsh appear instead of N, G, H and Y small caps. How can I have the two
  features together and somehow override the ligatures?\r\n\r\nHere's the code: \r\nfeature
  swsh {  \r\n    sub @swsh1 by @swsh2;    \r\n    sub N i by N_i.swsh;\r\n    sub
  h y by h_y.swsh;\r\n    sub n g by n_g.swsh;\r\n    sub n y by n_y.swsh;        \r\n
  \   sub r h by r_h.swsh;\r\n    sub r i by r_i.swsh;\r\n    sub r j by r_j.swsh;\r\n
  \   sub r k by r_k.swsh;        \r\n    sub r t by r_t.swsh;   \r\n    sub r.swsh'
  @fligs by r;\r\n    sub @swsh3 by @swsh4;\r\n} swsh;\r\n\r\nI've been messing about
  with it for so long I can't think straight.\r\n\r\nAny help gratefully received.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/featuresgrab_4746.png]"

  body: Thanks Gluk, but I've no idea what this means. I copied and pasted it into
    smcp and that didn't work, so I tried it in swsh and that didn't either. I'm more
    of a designer than a programmer, so my coding is at a very rudimentary level and
    I don't know what goes where.

  body: "Hi Nick\r\n\r\nHaving a guess at what is happen here, it could be that the
    'swsh' feature may be happening before 'smcp' and/or 'c2sc'. You probably want
    all the standard replacements to happen first - then have the swash ligatures
    lookups act on what's there after.\r\nAlso if changing text with swash ligs into
    small caps, you may need to decompose the swash ligs back to standard glyphs in
    a separate lookup before applying smcp lookups."
