  font in white (for the honorees' names/\"Save the date!\"/etc.) Identifont and Whatthefont
  aren't really helping. \r\n\r\nAny guesses?\r\n\r\nPS - Not in a rush to find the
  \"A Vision for the Future\" font (although it's pretty snazzy) and I'm guessing
  the little sans serif font is Myriad or something similar. But bonus points to anyone
  who knows what they are!\r\n\r\nPPS - Just edited to change title from \"sans serif\"
  to \"serif.\" It IS a serif font I'm looking for!\r\n\r\nPPPS - Found the font (it's
  [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiepolo/|Tiepolo]])! And the script font is
  [[http://www.dafont.com/hemmet.font|Hemmet]]! Unfortunately I can't find the sans
  serif! More explanation in the comments."

  body: "So I did get a higher def version of the file, and I found that the font
    I was looking for [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiepolo/|ITC Tiepolo Bold
    Italic]]. So there you go!\r\n\r\nThanks also to Ryuk for finding that script
    font!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the font I assumed would be the easiest to find turned
    out to be the hardest. I knew it was a humanist sans serif, but unfortunately
    most of the usual suspects - Myriad Pro, Frutiger, Open Sans, Source Sans - lack
    that slab serif on the capital I's, and the ones I'm aware of that do - Tahoma,
    Verdana - just kinda...don't look right.\r\n\r\nAny help?"
