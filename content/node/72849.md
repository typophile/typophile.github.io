body: I was asked to substitute Cyrillic text into  Illustrator CS4 pages that now
  have text in Japanese.  The Cyrillic text (set in Times New Roman) is longer than
  would fit nicely in the given spaces.  This is for a church booklet so it would
  be nice to have a sober Old-World serif which is also narrower than the Times and
  more beautiful.  Any recommendations? Any free fonts out there that would suit?  Spasiba.

    \u2013 and even a bit narrower than Times."

  body: Thank you Florian and Jongseong I was amazed by the promptness and aptness
    of your responses.  Both fonts you recommended are as narrow as Times, but much
    nicer on the eye. I will make a choice after some more study.
