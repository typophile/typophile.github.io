  a family, ideally for body text, but in the end it could end up only being worthwhile
  as a display font &#40;if it&#39;s worthwhile at all, that is!&#41; <BR> <BR>unfortunately
  the lowercase in this style looks terrible - and I don&#39;t see any way of making
  it look right - so I&#39;m thinking of making it into a small caps face, which would
  make it a less impossible matter of combining the right heights for UC / lc.   <BR>
  <BR>so, I have a question: <BR>has this been done already?  :D <BR> <BR>it just
  seems like such an obvious idea, someone must have done it already &#40;as a bitmap,
  like this&#41;? <BR> <BR>any thoughts or criticism of the face itself are also greatly
  appreciated. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: ' I do like the thick-and-thin stems - it has a nice Art Deco feel, and I
    can&#39;t remember a font like this offhand. <BR> <BR>The main problem is that
    without an lc this can&#39;t be a text face... Why would the lc look terrible?
    Maybe it gains too much width because of the 2-pixel stems? I&#39;d like to see
    what you have. Also, maybe try a version of 16-pixel height. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    ALT="lc"> <BR> <BR>the first 2 rows are trying to follow the same stem-width &#34;rule&#34;
    set by the UC - the 1st row is just more strict about it than the second. <BR>
    <BR>the other option, the 3rd row, would be to leave out any thickness to the
    lc, which might work - but... I think that would also defeat the whole purpose
    of this font.'

  body: ' &#62; has this been done already?  <BR> <BR>well, i remember once i made
    a sketch of something that looks alot like this. and counting how creative the
    pool of type designers are, i guess some people have allready thought of this.
    but - this is a very nice font. ahnd i have never seen a family built on this
    idea. ive never seen any font like this. so i advice you to continue to work on
    it. the X&#39;s and W&#39;s look alittle broken in all wieght. and i think hrant
    is totaly right, a wider middle stem for the &#39;m&#39; will make it look better.
    maybe a wider middle stem for the &#39;w&#39; too... '
