  body: "Once you\u2019ve desquooshed the letters, you will be able to see that this
    is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/helvetica_pro_condensed_bold/\">Helvetica
    Condensed Bold</a>, also sold as Europa Grotesk. The ink traps on the \u2018W\u2019
    are indeed a dead giveaway that it\u2019s a) Helvetica and b) not Neue Helvetica."
