  body: ' Stephen is right. This is a frienlier version of DIN. Both &#39;D&#39; and
    &#39;d&#39; are nice. In fact, your entire notching system is nice. The only characters
    that seems odd, are the &#39;f&#39; and the &#39;e&#39;. The cross-stroke on the
    &#39;f&#39; seems a bit high and the bold/heavy &#39;e&#39; is starting to fill
    in from the interpolation.  <BR> <BR>Very nice. '

  body: Hi rodrigo, <BR>I like it very much. It doesnt only give me a friendly DIN
    &#40;to quote stephen&#41;, but it gives a little Johnston type as well.  <BR>
    <BR>Love your D, what about the B? <BR> <BR>But there are still some small optical
    problem. <BR> <BR>Keep on DIGNAing... <BR> <BR>jacques

  body: 'Hi all, <BR> <BR>Here there are some improvements and items to correct, look
    at the pdf. <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot for your comments, but I have to say this in
    not a DIN font, it&#39;s a readable &#40;maybe friendly&#41; sans. <BR>I mean,
    readable is a function, and Digna works on it. Friendship is a virtue, an adjective.
    <BR> <BR>Please, could you help me with the optical topics that you mention? If
    you want, write privately to my email. <BR> <BR>Thanks again.  <BR> <BR><!-Attachment:

  body: 'Hi Rodrigo, I really like where Digna is going, it is open and friendy. Clean
    and legible in the Light and Regular weights. <BR>Favorite glyphs : 6, 9, e, g,
    p, m.  <BR>I think the Heavy weight needs larger counters, and S is  <BR>a bit  too
    loose for my taste. <BR>good luck. <BR>'

  body: Hi Rodrigo,  <BR>Nice font. Nice clean, open and friendly. I personally like
    the &#39;S&#39;. My concern is with the &#40;light&#41; &#39;3&#39;. It &#39;falls&#39;
    to the left if you ask me. <BR>The light &#39;c&#39; in your PDF looks like it
    is in the top and bottom a little thin compared to the other characters. <BR>
    <BR>Good luck, <BR>Ren
