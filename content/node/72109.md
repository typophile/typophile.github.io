  one to set Indic unicode fonts, and grateful to Thomas Phinney for revealing how
  to activate it. \r\n\r\nHas any additional functionality been added in CS5\u2014like,
  for instance, page numbers in whatever script one wants?\r\n\r\n(Previous thread
  on CS4 and Indic scripts [[Does Indesign CS4 support Indic scripts?|here]].)\r\n\r\n\u2014D"

    interface to control the world-ready composer (along with additional features
    that improve the work with Indic scripts): \r\nhttp://www.winsoft-international.com/en/products/scribedoor-for-creative-suite.html\r\n\r\nIt's
    quite affordable (\u20AC69 for the InDesign version, \u20AC99 for the InDesign
    + Illustrator bundle). \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    page numbering in scripts other than roman...\r\n\u2014D"
