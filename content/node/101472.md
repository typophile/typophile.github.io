  of my Graphirus font and I have a question in this regard: besides the letters and
  numbers, what other characters are often italicised? Diacritics, punctuation marks,
  mathematical symbols/operators? There are many takes on what to italicise and what
  not, so I'd like to hear opinions from you, the people who has been doing this longer
  than me )\r\n\r\nThanks"

    2) reader (\"can I imagine someone needs to present/recieve this element in a
    cursive manner?\").\r\nI would say that pictorial elements like arrows aren't
    worth of slanting or italicising in a font, but in the other hand, one can foresee
    a need of having italicised arrows, for certain purposes..."

    just about everything.\r\nExcept \xA9,  \xAE and \u2022.\r\nAlso, I don\u2019t
    usually italicize small marks: tittles/dots/periods, and the degree symbol and
    ring accent."

    notable omission: the estimated symbol.\r\n\r\nI made a rather small .enc file

  body: "What is optimal?\r\nAs Marcin says, consider usage.\r\nIMO, it looks like
    a mistake if text is in italics, with mathematical symbols upright.\r\nUnless
    you\u2019re making a math font, there is absolutely no reason* to put any upright
    glyphs in an italic font \u2014 except for \xA9, \xAE, \u2022, \u02DA,\xB0 and
    Estimate (if you are doing WGL4 encoding).\r\n\r\n*Except laziness."

    to be legal? I don't think so, since even \"(c)\" is acceptable AFAIK. I also
    don't grasp why any of the others should be upright. You want the upright one?
    Use the Roman. You want the slanted one? There it is.\r\n\r\n* Related: http://typophile.com/node/98229\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Slanted \xA9 or \xAE look strange (being rather pictorial elements), but
    I can imagine a dense, technical or business material, full of quotations, where
    they could be an advantage.  \r\nLeaving upright periods makes utility sense,
    because people often don't make exact selections...\r\nAnyway, I have problems
    in saying what sould and what shouldn't be italicised, because there are such
    texts and such conditions, where I find those upright elements as details of incredible
    beauty, and I would even accept the geometric zeros there."
