  body: "It's pretty easy to spot a type design like this one:\r\n\r\nFirst -- determine
    what \"classification\" the design falls under.\r\n\"Is it serif or sans?\"\r\nIt
    doesn't matter since either way its MONOSPACED.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mono-space.png]\r\n\r\nSecond
    -- Myfonts.com is one of several font search sites that you can browse by classification.\r\n\r\nThird
    -- Determine if there are any particularly unique characters or characteristics
    about the typeface, then start browsing.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/myfont_mono.png]\r\n\r\nTotal
    search time: 2 minutes, if even that.\r\nGive it a shot next time. Eventually
    it becomes easier to do. :-)"

  body: "It actually looks as if they did, Chris.\r\nI noticed a few minor differences,
    but wrote it off to poor repro... lower case \"m\" in Citibank version is more
    open, very slightly shorter upper serifs on lowercase \"i\" and \"l\", plus it
    looks like they at least changed the wordspace to be tighter than the monospaced
    font."
