  body: 'OK, had to stop looking for a while while I watched Leeds get robbed by Sunderland
    &amp; a crap ref. <BR> <BR>Well, both the answers so far are less than seven,
    so neither are the route I was looking for. <BR> <BR>Now, to complicate things,
    I just noticed you can get there in 6 by this route too, but its not the way David
    went. <BR>As I&#39;m expected to declare the winner, do they have to find the
    same route I found, or do I just have to ensure that they found a valid route?
    <BR>If its the latter, as I found that it can be done via my original route in
    6, then David wins. <BR> <BR>If the exact route has to be discovered then its
    still open, in which case: <BR>Clue #1. <BR>You&#39;ll need to go via one of Apple&#39;s
    national home pages &#40;ie <a href="http://www.apple.com/COUNTRYCODE/" target="_blank">www.apple.com/COUNTRYCODE/</a>&#41;'
