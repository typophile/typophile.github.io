  body: "I thought his writing would have been smoother, with more flow to it. Or
    maybe being a left hander forces one to write like that?\r\n\r\nHe does seem to
    curl his hand around in a peculiar way to write 'from above' so that he can see
    what he's writing perhaps. Whatever, that particular way of writing doesn't seem
    conducive to smoothness.\r\n\r\n(I'm probably going to be crucified by lefties
    now, but don't take it personally, some may have the most beautiful hand writing)."

  body: To me, it looks clearly like the work of a signature machine. Every politician
    gets there sig retraced by a machine that mimics there real signature.  These
    guys have so many things to sign that they never would have time for it all otherwise.

  body: many of us lefties 'hook' or 'arch' our hand while writing. this is caused
    by the need to avoid smearing what we write as we write, since english is written
    left to right. probably in some asian language it would be beneficial. personally,
    i turn the page and seemingly write top to bottom which again just helps avoid
    having the hand smear what has been written. no doubt this has been a source of
    great stress for lefties over the ages since lefties are usually more right-brain
    and therefore more artistic/creative. ok, let me hear it from the righties now.
