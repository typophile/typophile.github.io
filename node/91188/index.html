  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It has been said several times on other threads on this forum, but good quality fonts seem to be very expensive to the newcomer / rank amateur (a category to which I firmly belong). I am looking to purchase at least three, possibly four decent fonts to use to produce my documents with (technical reports for UK planning matters, ranging from 10 -1,000 pages).</p>
<p>Thus far I am liking the look of <strong>Brioni text</strong> from <cite>Typotheque</cite> which (after much googling) I learned was one of the primary fonts for the Financial Times Weekend magazine; in keeping with the FT theme I am also considering <strong>Fedra Sans</strong> from the same company.</p>
<p>From <cite>Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones</cite> I am torn between the <strong>Hoefler Text</strong> and the seemingly more recent <strong>Mercury Text</strong>. Both appear to offer all sorts of &lsquo;weights&rsquo; - something I first encountered when reading &lsquo;Typography Lawyers&rsquo;. That said, the <strong>Equity</strong> font by Mr Butterick also seems really good, except it doesn&rsquo;t do &lsquo;old-style&rsquo; numbers (yet), but at only $120 you do get a lot of font for your money.</p>
<p>Rather than trawl the web looking for lots of free fonts I would like something with a lot of characters (&lsquo;glyphs&rsquo;?) that has been well designed and I can use for documents that have a technical / professional content.</p>
<p>Are these choices wide of the mark? How did others get started when it came to selecting their first font-for-cash?</p>

If you choose a typeface based on the fact that a prestigious magazine uses it, you surrender your valuation for someone else&rsquo;s. And, finally, your choice of a typeface isn&rsquo;t going to make your prose any more credible or erudite; it can only render it more—or less—readable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What an enviable dilemma! You&rsquo;ll get a number of
good pointers from professional users of fonts I&rsquo;m
sure; here are some opinions from a maker:</p>
<p>Brioni:
<a href="http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/brioni/">http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/brioni/</a>
It&rsquo;s nicely contemporary without being mannered.
Be aware that its generous x-height makes it more
suitable for small point sizes.</p>
<p>Fedra is idiosyncratic, but I believe highly readable.
It also has the wonderful feature of multiple extender
lengths, which allows the accommodation of various
point sizes of text.</p>
<p>Hoefler Text comes with Macs. Because it&rsquo;s very nice.
But that also means it might be too common to pay
good money for. Mercury is a Fleischmann revival,
which means it&rsquo;s naturally highly readable, and a
solid choice in many other ways.</p>
<p>Equity is a nice if conservative design, and its low
price might make it worthwhile, although it can&rsquo;t
be too versatile; you could still use it to add some
divergence from the other workhorses you&rsquo;ll buy.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose, it does sounds like you will
need a wide choice of numeral styles: proportional
&amp; fixed-width combined with lining &amp; &ldquo;old-style&rdquo; at
the very least.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An enviable predicament indeed. Brioni text, Fedra and Fedra sans would all make great choices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add a couple more to your list: you might like some of the faces that Hoftype produce, particularly Cala: <a href="http://www.hoftype.com/node/37">http://www.hoftype.com/node/37</a> (serif) &amp; Impara: <a href="http://www.hoftype.com/impara">http://www.hoftype.com/impara</a> (sans-serif), both of which would work well together I think. As a little added bonus, they offer the light weights of both for free at myfonts so you can try them out to see how they look.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Much appreciated <strong>hrant</strong>. Guidance from someone who has &lsquo;been there, done that&rsquo; is always welcome. I am also looking at those fonts that <strong>penn</strong> mentioned too, but it took a fair bit of research to narrow down my choices to the four that I mentioned in my original post.

<p>I do not work with typography or graphic design, so I do not have professional experience in that area.</p>
<p>Maybe something to think about: As TimesNR is everywhere the “transitional” serif model (the genre of Times) might be seen as the most neutral serif model, therefore it might be a good idea to go with Mercury. Other than that, I did read here that slabs stand for a certain conservative reliability, so Brioni would be a good choice too. In my opinion Hoefler Text as an “old style” serif model is too literary.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Celeste, a contemporary reinterpretation of the Transitional heritage, by Christopher Burke, seems an appropriate choice for your needs - text settings for reports instead of, say, novels or more &ldquo;literary&rdquo; oriented publications. I have read a book set in it (an essay on Tschichold, by Burke himself), set in a large format, in two columns, and it worked nicely.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>oldnick is quite right. From your posts it seems like you are looking for a transitional face, or at least something quite neutral and “academic”. I tend to consider Fleischmans (Mercury is a contemporary reintepretation, but perhaps a bit too polished?) a category of it’s own. Although they were made for book printing (I have a beautiful book from 1805 typeset in Fleischman), there’s more “sparkle” on the page then with a typical old style face, so it might work for your use. I’d like to suggest Kent Lew’s <a href="http://fontsinuse.com/norwegian-bible-2011-editions/">Whitman</a> as another option.</p>
<p>If you manage to make a shortlist (consider personal taste, technical requirements &amp;c), I strongly suggest you get hold of printed samples—ideally produced with the same printer as your technical reports—to compare them IRL.</p>
<p>Another thing: Don’t get sucked in to the gazillion weights hysteria! Consider what you <em>really</em> need.</p>

Since price is a consideration, if you can&rsquo;t afford four decent fonts, then settle for two. Two decent fonts are way better than four less satisfactory fonts, and you&rsquo;ll never regret your purchase.</p>
