  available to all people around the world, even those with limited access and minimal
  choices, most likely with PCs. \r\n\r\nCan you recommend a \u2018universal\u2019
  typeface that can translate into many languages but is still 'considered' and slightly
  sexy?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any/all suggestions!"
