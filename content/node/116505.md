body: I'm setting a devotional book (selections from the BCP) and am trying Centaur
  for it. Adobe Centaur is what I have. I know it's often, though not always, been
  used in larger text sizes (e.g., Bruce Rogers used a custom version for the Bible
  with 22 point text if memory serves). Anyway, I'm trying 13/16 with a fairly narrow
  line length. I welcome any criticism, but want to particularly ask for thoughts
  on (1) whether the type size is too small to make effective use of Centaur, (2)
  whether the leading is sufficient, and (3) whether the italic is too tight and needs
  some letterspacing (not that I want to steal sheep or anything). But all criticisms
  are welcome. Thanks.

    do love the feel of your layout and I have always been a fan of Centaur - "

  body: "I think everything is OK, except the optical scaling of the font.\r\nThe
    body text is too wispy\u2014that is a shortcoming of this rendition of Centaur;
    but you can heavy it up with the Stroke feature in InDesign.\r\nAnd the Drop cap
    is too clunky\u2014try thinning it down with Stroke, or use a display face.\r\nHoe\uFB02er\u2019s
    Requiem would be an alternative."

  body: Satyr is a nice face but I feel a bit too heavy for this use - Centaur is
    tricky to use but worth the effort.

  body: "I will agree that the main problem is with the typeface. Centaur is beautiful
    but the digitized version does not really serve as a text typeface. \r\nMaybe
    you can save it by using a larger size but it seems you can't change the type
    size much before your lines become too sort.\r\nA very interesting alternative
    to Centaur is [[http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=130|Vendetta]]. I just received a
    test copy of a book I made with Vendetta (medium weight) and I am very happy with
    the result. Or else you can use Arno or a Jenson revival."

  body: Both Hrant and Dimitris have come up with good alternative faces to consider.
    I am a fan of Iowan Oldstyle by John Downer and was not aware of Vendetta - another
    sucess for him. As to Centaur, Nick makes a good point about Centaur being wispy
    - when Bruce Rogers used it he had ink spread to give it more body - when I have
    used it I always track it close and that seems to give it more "bulk". I would
    say you should look at Vendetta and Faunus but also try Nick's idea with Centaur.

  body: Thank you all for the excellent suggestions. I liked Vendetta and Faunus (especially
    the latter--amazing) but had some concern that they might call attention to themselves
    for this particular project. I've set it in Requiem, as suggested by Nick (using
    12/15). It looks great to my eyes. I would post a new set of sample pages here
    in Requiem, but I can't add an attachment to a comment. If anyone is interested
    in seeing the Requiem version, I'll start a new thread for it. Again, thanks to
    all for the suggestions.

  body: Requiem seems a very good substitute for Centaur. Anyway, I would also have
    a look at Bembo Book.
