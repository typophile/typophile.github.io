    to find free alternatives to a font is to use [[http://www.whatfontis.com|WhatFontiS]],
    starting with the commercial font sample of your choice and limit results to \"display
    only free fonts or free alternative fonts\"."

  body: "Ryuk, you might simply want to be helpful, and quite often you indeed are,
    but I'm sorry to say that by suggesting such free alternatives you're damaging
    the craft of type design as well as Typophile.\r\n\r\nTo me these types of requests
    should go ignored, preferably discouraged here.\r\n\r\nAlso, if WhatFontiS is
    in fact too easy to co-opt into bypassing quality commercial fonts I might suggest
    that it be censored here (or at very least direct links should be removed).\r\n\r\nI'm
    no policeman - I'm simply defending things I value.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
