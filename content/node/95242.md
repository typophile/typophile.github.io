  set in the Disco era. Soon I ll will start editing and I would like to use font
  that are reminiscent of this particular time.\r\n\r\nI have no clue whatsoever about
  fonts create then si I want to ask which ones are your favorites?\r\n\r\nIt is worth
  mentioning that on top of being a Disco-era movie it is also a slasher, so there
  is a bit of horror mixed in as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input."

    didn\u2019t read the horror bit, so Avant Garde may not qualify."
