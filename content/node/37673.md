  a assignment on types. \r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is draw a typeface build from element
  as you see in the img. The idea is based on different elements like corners which
  I can copy/paiste and hereby quickly create a new type-expression. The basic idea
  is inspired by things created in the Bauhaus periods and other who work systematic
  and so on...\r\n\r\nI'm curious to hear what other typedesigners have of comments
  and if there is anything I should look into - while doing this type, that could
  help me in skipping steps (due to I'm new in typedesigning).\r\n\r\nHope to from
  all of you designere.\r\n\r\nHave great day.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/O_5043.jpg]"

    out of this image just by cutting and pasting various elements. And while designing
    this typeface(specific) you don't even need to keep the rules in your mind.\r\nI
    made a similar typeface in a day while attending a conference in Mumbai last year.
    I took rail ticket window as an inspiration and built a complete face out of that.
    I posted it on the Typophile also. Though I didn't get much time to work on the
    design further, Its incomplete.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/31629\">Here

  body: "Klaxon by Ryan Hughes (Device) is interesting.\r\nWith the exception of a
    couple of letters, the units don't change position, they just \"toggle\" on/off.\r\nI
    always thought it would be interesting to animate something like that, and have
    started a few designs with that in mind, but never finished them.\r\nAlso: Delay,
    Airport, LCD, and the legendary Fregio Mecano (CG Section)"
