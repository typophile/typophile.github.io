this is my first font (see attachment). I've just begun to start some of the characters in Ilustrator. I only have 7 characters to show you at this time. I'd like to know if anyone thinks its too similar to an existing font?

Thanks guys!

@nhood: Very nice, although /a/ will need a spur/terminal/tail to distinguish it from /o/. But otherwise these letters are very promising. Keep on drawing. But don't draw them too geometrically (look at /b/ for instance) but rather visually. /c/ for instance is pointing upwards even thou the top of it is probably geometrically level.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@nhood : for fonts, licencing means defining area of uses for your typeface ; unless you target branding market, your licence should be as permissive as possible, because then your typeface is meant to convoy information and as you know information is everywhere, in print, in website, withing e-books, and people need typeface which allow embedding and great freedom of use (except of use, claiming the design as their own, and sell the typeface at your expense).
most typefaces are under restrictive licences for paranoid and/or outdated conception of what a typeface is supposed to be. 
But with open source, Google Fonts & allii shouting around, type industry is shifting around. As a challenger, your advantage is be proactive relative to this aspect.

		<div class="commentbody">hi nhood, it's quite simple in fact. 

1. is it for branding or for text ? both is making things trickier

2. if for branding, control-freak copyright and at best, sell it as an exclusive corporate typeface

3. if for text, prepaid copyleft ; set a souscription and then release it under OFL licence ; do not run after piracy, it's a waste of time and money ; be sure to determine how much you want to earn, be paid and then release the tiger!

More information on the OFL licence here:

Wouldn't it make sense to actually finish designing the typeface before selling it? On the other hand, if there's a company called "cedfgab" or something like that ... ;)</div>

i appreciate your input very much. What exactly is an exclusive corporate typeface?

Yes, it would make sense to finish the font before selling it. I suppose i shouldn't concern myself with licensing until i'm finished.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Exclusivity can be one of the conditions of a special End User License Agreement. A client (in this case, usually a corporation that commissioned a custom typeface for their own branding use) may wish to acquire the exclusive right to use your font, thus denying your right to sell it to anyone else, either in perpetuity, or for a specified limited time, or conditional on other circumstances; in exchange for a substantial additional fee. Exclusivity can multiply the sale price of a font license many times above your usual retail price, since it would have to compensate you for all projected sales if you were able to sell it normally.

But that's more a question for the Release forum.</div>
