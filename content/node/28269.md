    those were a 2 and a 7.\r\nI just now realised that the two are a mirror flip
    of each other. I am not sure what that square is for. I would like to see something
    joining the 2 and 7 together more, like a square wrapping around them together
    rather than inside them.\r\nThe 2006 is okay.\r\n\r\nOverall it just feels too
    busy. It's like you got three great ideas and combined them into one logo. Try
    to pick the best one and maximise it, whether that be the s-7 symmetry, the cut
    off letters, or the color, or the square thing, whatever that is.\r\n\r\n-sam"

  body: "I would imagine this is about close examination, reflection, developing outside
    the frame/thinking outside the box. I rather like the composition but do feel
    that the colour of 7 is rather dominating, together with Convocation which you
    might try partial obscuring to improve. I think for a final version I would work
    up the 27 combination as a monoline.\r\nTim"

    etc. and would have never seen the 27.

  body: I like the direction you are going in.. I got it at first glance.. A couple
    things I would do, get rid of the square in the back and make the 2 and the 7
    the same color.. Maybe a nice 60% gray or something close.

  body: "well in the spirit of lateness...\r\n\r\nI like the direction as well. however,
    it does look like a gun, and i absolutely did not see the 2. maybe try building
    the 27 out of the counterforms of the number... or doing something to make the
    2 slighty nuanced from the 7. that they are mirrors I think is what's making me
    not take it to be a different character. i just assume it's a stylization. and
    the square doesn't really make sense. is that to represent the 'th'? for the 27th?
    anyway, i think it could look real nice. biggest problem is the 2."
