    target=\"_blank\">Eaglefeather Bold</a> (stretched, obviously). The font for the
    menu on the website is Ethan Dunham's <a href=\"http://fonthead.com/fonts-vol4.php\"
    target=\"_blank\">Greyhound</a> You didn't show that in your original post, so
    perhaps you already know that or don't care. Thought I'd mention it, though.\r\n\r\nI
    don't recall ever seeing a font like the main Dixons logo."
