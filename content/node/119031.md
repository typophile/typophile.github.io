body: "Hi,\r\nI am new to this forum and would like to ask your opinion/critiques
  on my new logo for a small design agency. The older one was created some time ago
  and now I'm not fully satisfied with it. It doesn't work very well on small sizes
  and looks a little bit old-fashioned to me. I've created several new versions with
  a modern look but can't decide which will work better. \r\n\r\nTo keep continuity
  with the old logo I used same red and gray. The font is also the same.\r\n\r\nWhat
  logo do you think suits best for a small design studio? Do you have any negative
  associations with any of these logos? Any thoughts and opinions would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-0-old_4548.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-1_6547.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-2_4884.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-3_5135.jpg]"

    six sided hexagon jarrs a bit."

  body: I like the old one better too. If you're concerned about small sizes, maybe
    make the characters larger within the boxes. I'd delete "media" under the logo,
    it seems redundant since it's repeated to the right. (If I had to pick one of
    the new ones, it would be the star.)

  body: "Hi and thanks a lot for the feedback! You guys are really very helpful!\r\n\r\nIt's
    good to know that somebody likes the old logo :-). What if to make slight modifications
    of it and remove letters in order to solve problem with small sizes and add a
    star to the red square for the sake of a visual accent. I see star as a symbol
    of an achievement reachable through hard work, dedication and talent (hope it's
    not much trite and commonplace). And then it is probably better to move a red
    square to the right to the end of the usual direction of eye movement.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think of this? Is this version any better? Does the old logo looks old-fashioned
    to you? I feel the need for a more modern look buy maybe I'm plain wrong.\r\n\r\nI
    also made a version of the old logo without media at the bottom as JamesM  suggested.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-rev_4842.jpg]"

  body: "Personally, I still prefer the version with letters (the star <em>is</em>
    overused and in this instance gives me a Texas/military vibe). However, the letters
    look misaligned.\r\nFor the text part, I think you should try to move \u201Cmedia\u201D
    under \u201CYULA\u201D."

  body: "I'd keep the letters too. I've seen plenty of logo concepts aren't legible
    in a small size, but I don't think yours is that much of a problem. Does the overall
    width (symbol + name) create a problem in narrow layouts? Maybe you could make
    an alternate version with the name stacked below the symbol.\r\n\r\nAgree with
    Riccardo that the letters look misaligned. And I like it without \"media\" below
    it."

    part of the logo works best with just Y-U-L-A, while for the <em>text</em> part
    I would try to stack the two words vertically.'
