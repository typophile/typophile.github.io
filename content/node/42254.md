  can offer a few suggestions. I\u2019m looking to match this bold condensed serif
  for a customer. Berthold Sorbonne has some of the characteristics, as does Cooper
  Oldstyle Bold, but neither is a direct hit.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indianajones2_6586.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom_ver3_5557.jpg]\r\n"

  body: It definitely looks like a variant of Cooper Oldstyle, but not one I've ever
    seen before. Maybe something from the later years of Headliners or Photo-Lettering
    Inc.?

  body: "Thanks Mark. I couldn\u2019t locate anything in my collection of PLINC or
    Headliners reference, so I\u2019ve suggested Cooper Oldstyle as the closest match."
