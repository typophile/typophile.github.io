  body: I have the same difficulty, Mark. My brain wants to impose perspective on
    the parallelogram. I also find that my success with the angle bisection depends
    very much on the orientation of the angle.

  body: I think my skill at finding the center of the circle comes from FontLab's
    lack of crosshairs on the scale tool. When I want to interactively scale a circle
    from the center, it's usually too much trouble to set up guides to locate the
    center. I just eyeball it.
