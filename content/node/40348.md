  circle-shaped device used to terminate a [[Stroke|stroke]], for example on the end
  of the arm on <strong>r</strong>, or the [[Tail|tail]] tip of <strong>y</strong>.
  Ball terminals are a prominent feature of so-called \"modern roman\" types which
  came into existence in the second half of the 18th century with the appearance of
  [[Didone|Didones]] and types used by the [[Fournier|Fourniers]] as well as [[Giambattista
  Bodoni]]. Ball terminals are typically drawn in a strict geometric form of a pure
  circle. Some types however, principally [[John Baskerville|Baskerville's]] [[roman
  type]], feature organically-shaped ball terminals.\r\n\r\nBall Terminals join the
  stroke at an angle, as opposed to [[Lachrymal Terminal]]s which taper into the stroke.\r\n\r\n<strong>Additional
