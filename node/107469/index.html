  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>greetings fine ladies and gentlemen of typophile!
it seems quite a lot adults have a cherished steckenpferd.
yours-a-many is typophilia - mine is the embellishment of my digital music library with original release covers.
restoration via photoshop is the means by which i try to bring faded lp-covers back to a more mint life.
deutsche grammophon recording seems to be the stylistically consistent-most amongst the recording companies when it comes to the design of their lp-era-covers. a fact which not least relates to their specific use of fonts in cover-art.
i am hereby trying to verify which fonts exactly dgg used in their covers 1950s-60s</p>
<p>specimen 1 shows a detail of lpm 18 010 a 1951 recording with a 1st post-war style cover
i&rsquo;ve come to think that bauer bodoni roman osf fits best to the letters whereas the numbers are bauer bodoni lt.</p>
<p>specimen 2 shows slpm 138 072 - a 1959 recording in the 2nd post-war style (and 1st stereo style)
both letters and numbers seem to be in weiss std. &ldquo;amadeus-quartett&rdquo; however appears set in weiss sb italic sw. main problem here is that i couldn&rsquo;t find a font that provides me with the alternative style swashes (e.g. at top-right of a; extra wide bottomstroke of q)
throughout all cover styles the record-id seems be set in a futura font.</p>
<p>specimen 3 finally is a detail of slpm 138 114. it is from a 4th style cover and stands at the transition in font-use and design at the time between 1959/60.
identifying its fonts provides me with the most difficulties.
if i set &ldquo;johannes brahms&rdquo; to garamond premier pro italic the differences to the actually used font don&rsquo;t meet the eye in a way to brutish. here &ldquo;amadeus-quartett&rdquo; is set in regular italic as well although other covers show an inconsistent use of alternative swash letters for initials and finitials (is that a word?…)
HOWEVER: i&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time looking for the matching roman style font. to me it looks well like garamond. yet: neither garamond out there which i tried fits quite right. 
at this point i don&rsquo;t want to go into further details but rather ask bluntly:
any ideas?</p>

URW Garamond is also close, <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?622">http://www.identifont.com/show?622</a>, but again there is a date issue.
Possibly a photo lettering era version of Garamond that has not been digitized?

please, everybody: feel encouraged to speak your minds on specimen 1 &amp; 2 fonts as well!</p>
<p>on nr.3 :  i take it that don too believes the roman text to be a garamond yet not one of the many (at least to my eyes: closely) garamondesque fonts.
there are a few points i want to point out which might help coming closer to a solution for YOU the typophile experts. forgive my poor idiom - i hope you get what i mean to say</p>
<ol>
<li>the small letter a seems very distinctive - top leftward curve is rather fat, sitting on a slim downwards stroke,; the belly is not exactly drawing a curve but a little square top-left.</li>
<li>the i&rsquo;s corpus - i may be mistaken - gives the impression to narrow down a bit towards the bottom AND its dot is further up than any other garamond i</li>
<li>the e&rsquo;s horizontal stroke is way in the upper half of the corpus and looks more like a serif that goes &ldquo;all the way&rdquo; (consider the strange dark spot in the right corner)</li>
<li>the t&rsquo;s cross-beam is positioned further up than in any other garamond known to me; if one draws a triangle from both ends ot the cross-beam to the top of the vertical stroke - the top angle is much more obtuse than in all the other garamond small letter ts.</li>
<li>the capital s might be leaning a bit further to the right than otherwhere and it might well be &ldquo;kneeling&rdquo; a bit more in the bottom curve.</li>
<li>small letter p &amp; q have an obviously shorter shorter vertical stroke than found elsewhere.</li>
<li>capital q &ldquo;tail&rdquo; is much longer</li>
<li>perhaps very interestingly number 7 does NOT have a serif!</li>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for the input janek!
i suppose, you are referring to the actual font that was used in the production of those covers?
because i am sure i did try out some stempel garamond @ myfonts and it didn&rsquo;t seem to fit &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo;.
do you have a certain stempel garamond in mind?</div>
