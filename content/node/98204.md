  (historical) source for the so-called \"Potsdam Initials\" as appearing in one of
  Dan X. Solo's books for Dover Publications (\"Celtic and Medieval Alphabets\", 1998).
  I am finishing an OpenType adaptation of such initials and would like to credit
  them appropriately (or ask for the corresponding permissions in case they are somehow
  copyrighted). \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_potsdam_5044.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help."

    ornaments for some initials (D, E, G, I and N).\r\n\r\n2. There exists one \"Potsdam\"
    typeface family designed in 1934 by R. Golpon for J.D. Trennert und Sohn. However,
    they do not seem to have designed/released the \"Potsdam Initials\".\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

    some blackletter experts are attending there. \r\n\r\nOr try to contact <a href=\"http://www.typosition.de/kontakt\">Peter
    Reichardt</a>. He is one of the best in having knowledge of extinct (german) typefaces.
    \r\n\r\nAnother one could be <a href=\"http://www.druckerey.de/index.php/kontakt.html\">Martin
    Z. Schr\xF6der</a> from druckerey.de. He works, publishes and writes about old
    typefaces. \r\n\r\nI had a look at the site of <a href=\"http://www.romana-hamburg.de/Fraktur.htm\">Dipl.-Ing.
    Gerhard Helzel</a>, but have only found some lookalikes. \r\n\r\nThat's what I
    can recommend. \r\n\r\n "

  body: "Thanks again for your replies. I haven't dared to try the first three suggestions
    from your first post because I can hardly read/write German. I also checked G.
    Helzel's and the Klingspor Museum's sites to no effect. However, from the first
    hint in my second post and from information digged from Luc Devroy's site and
    from F. Bauer's \"Chronik der Schriftgie\xDFereien in Deutschland und den deutschsprachigen
    Nachbarl\xE4ndern\" (set into PDF by H. Reichardt in 2011), I discovered that
    one Friedrich Schoch (FS) designed around 1840 a typeface (\"Schochisch\") on
    which the 1900's \"Neudeutschen Schriften\" seem to have been based. Solo's \"Potsam
    Initials\" fit perfectly with those typefaces, so joining everything together
    it is my (possibly wild) guess that those initials were originally designed by
    the \"Schriftschneiderei  und  -gie\xDFerei  Friedrich Schoch\" ca. 1840. I'm
    afraid I can't go further, so any evidence or oppinion supporting/rejecting this
    guess will be mostly appreciated.\r\n"
