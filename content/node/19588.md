  Only got a graphic of it so have attached it. \r\n\r\nI have been trying to identify
  it with no luck but hopefully some of you might recognise it. If not then maybe
  you have suggestions as to a font that is similar / close to it?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\nDN"

  body: "Ouch, a hand written script... See <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forums/typeid/faq/#Q_15\">section
    14</a> of the FAQ.\r\n\r\nThose are the hardest. Because they are so easy and
    cheap to produce there are literally thousands of them floating around on the
    web.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen this script in another context, with different
    characters, especially repeating ones? It could even be a custom lettered logo
    for all we know, and only these 6 characters exist."
