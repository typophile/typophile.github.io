body: "The attached sampler is not for Latin, or any other language, except that of
  Nature. \r\nI designed it to illustrate my physics theory. Recently it was used
  it to good advantage to illustrate my essay \"Is Reality Digital Or Analog? Physics
  Is Undecided - A Beautiful Universe Theory Answers\" for a contest. Please feel
  free to download the pdf, rate and give your opinions about it on the contest website
  [[http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/836|here]].\r\nBelow is a typical illustration
  from the paper.\r\nThe full original 2005 paper \"Beautiful Universe\" can be downloaded
  from\r\n[[http://vixra.org/abs/1012.0017|here]]; the first sections of both papers
  are not too technical and can be understood by the layperson. The rest I myself
  just barely understand!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FIG-5_6286.jpg]"

  body: "A few years after using this font and illustrating my physics papers, I realized
    that the arrows showing rotation inside the spheres where pointing in the wrong
    direction!! If the + sign is regarded as 'up' the nodes should be rotating anti-clockwise,
    following the so-called right hand rule: if the thumb points in the direction
    of the current the magnetic field turns in the direction the other four finger
    are pointing to.  I had to revise all the glyphs of the font as in the attached
    image, and used it to redo the [[www.ne.jp/asahi/tamari/vladimir/beautiful_univ_rev_oct_2011.pdf|
    Beautiful Universe Theory]] paper with new illustrations.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bu_font_corrected_3581.jpg].

  body: "Best to avoid ambiguous language like \u201Chere\u201D and \u201Chere\u201D
    in hyperlinks. They provide no information as to where they will take the user,
    and create barriers for visually impaired readers using text to speech software.
    When creating a link that initiates the download of a PDF, it is best to state
    so in the language of the link and indicate the file size so users know what to
    expect."
