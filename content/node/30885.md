    Craig''s List, is that you never hear back from anybody ever--a waste of time.
    Face to face networking is what works. '

  body: I use LinkedIn for my resume and to generally keep my address book up to date.
    Facebook I use to keep in touch with people and find out which famous designer
    is using a bunny on a magazine cover (which absolutely made me smile!). Both are
    useful. I've started using Plaxo, but wonder if I'm going a bit OTT.

  body: LinkedIn has been useful for me -- I would echo what aluminum said, that it's
    more about staying in touch with your work-related network, and I could directly
    relate using it to a couple projects I've had. I could see using this site if
    you were looking for a job, but it seems too overwhelming for any meaningful networking
    -- "media" is an enormous pool to swim in, something like Typophile would probably
    be more useful if you were looking to make type design contacts, for example.

    book people, editors publishers, agents.\r\n\r\nI think you have to pass a clever
    test in order to post there. And if you post too many boring posts you are banned.\r\n\r\nNot
    a bad idea actually."
