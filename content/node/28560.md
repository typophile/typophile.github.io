  opinions from any type people. So let me know what you think! It's for my freelance
  company studio513.net better known as Studio513. My tag line is \"Embracing the
  butterfly effect.\" The 513 was my late grandmother's birthday so I named it after
  her.\r\n\r\nSo the little icon representing me is what I'm talking about....\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    which may not be the best image to represent your design studio.  \r\nBut 513
    reads well, and I do see the butterfly if that's what you're going for."

  body: "Kim, \r\n\r\ni really like the butterfly mark. Not 100% sure about the spacing
    between the right 'feeler' and the 3, it seems slightly too tight. Also, have
    you tried replacing the upwards stroke on the 5 and implementing a ball terminal
    here as well? Might look more balanced. I'd love to see some subtle refinements
    to really bring it home. \r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\nPS. I have a few pointers about your
    website (even though you didn't ask for that) IM/email me if you are interested."

  body: "Oh! The butterfly. Umm...it's cute. I think you could go a step further and
    use some hand drawn calligraphy to give it a more organic feel. It's a bit rigid
    for a butterfly right now.\r\n\r\nAs for your site...it's an 5mb flash file. You're
    going to loose a chunk of your audience right there.\r\n\r\n"

    best in moderation, IMHO...so I'm probably not the person to ask.

    you are doing/showing can eassily be achieved in HTML/CSS. Why don't you look
    into a free blogging software such as Wordpress to show your work (have a look,
    this is what i use) - You don't have to be a technical whizzkid to implement it
    and it can be easily customised to meet your needs.\r\n\r\nAnd this might just
    be a personal opinion, but it might be a good idea to remove that counter at the
    bottom of the page. "

    how many people actually visit. It's only going to be there for a little while.
    Eventually, I'll take it off.

  body: "\"Ohhhh me likes flash.\"\r\n\r\nOK. We're just saying many people don't...especially
    when it is used for somethingthat could have been done without it.\r\n\r\n\"The
    counter is for other reasons, I\u2019m trying to see how many people actually
    visit.\"\r\n\r\nThe counter won't tell you that. You need a web stats analysis
    tool...this is usually provided free by most competant web hosting companies.
    If not, there are 3rd party apps that can do it for you (like Google Analytics).\r\n"

  body: "Hi Datura\r\n\r\nDoes the butterfly (and your tagline) describe what you
    do? If so, stick with the butterfly, but I think you could try to make it fly
    (it's a bit rigid for a butterfly).\r\n\r\nAre you totally happy about '513'?
    Is it well-known among your customers? I mean, choosing a firm name because it
    is your grandmother's birthday is not the normal way of making an excellent firm
    name. I knew a person who set up a design firm called 'Magnolia' because she liked
    the movie. I would say that this is not the best approach.\r\n\r\n--\r\nsoren

  body: "Maybe I should explain a little more. I am no where near a \"design firm.\"
    My full time job is for another company. This is more of a place for me to display
    my freelance work. I'm prob considered and amateur to the people on this site!\r\n\r\nMy
    tagline is \"Embracing the butterfly effect.\" Which to me is a metaphor for the
    design process--how one thing effects another in the design itself. \r\n\r\nAbout
    the 513--my grandmother was more of my mother and I lost her when I was 18, it
    changed my whole life. I feel like she is still watching over me which is why
    I named the studio after her. My goal is for her to be proud of me and my art."

    body: "My point is that you must not choose a firm name (no matter how small a
      firm) that becomes an obstacle. If your grandmother meant a lot to you, then
      fine. But if everyone that sees the mark misinterpret it, then you should not
      use it, but change to something else.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in fact only talking
      about principles. And choosing a name for personal reasons that are not obvious
      to the spectator _must_ be the wrong way of thinking.\r\n\r\nThat said, your
      mark probably works just fine. '513' has really no irrelavant connotations.
      I was more worried about the Magnolia case.\r\n\r\nBut one weakness about your
      mark is this: when people see, they go: \"It reads 53\" or \"It reads 53 or
      513\" (the middle digit has a different style than the other two).\r\n\r\nI
      like the way you have flipped the 5.\r\n\r\n--\r\nsoren_olsen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
