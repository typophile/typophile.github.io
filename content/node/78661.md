  body: Except that JUnicode is like 1MB, so it takes a good 10&mdash;15 seconds for
    the font to show up ...

  body: I wouldn't have used JUnicode except that its license allowed me to make the
    modifications required and it had all but one of the ligatures I needed. The font
    used is irrelevant to the process. The font could be considerably optimized but
    that has not been done as it's the effect that's important right now.

  body: Though I greatly appreciate the forward moving effort here, the bottom line
    is that the resulting typography, it's effect if you wish, is not looking so good
    for the reader.

  body: Well, I would hope you're not presuming to speak for all readers. To be able
    to take a regular text document and without losing the ability to spell-check
    and without having to type with special characters such as the long-s and ligatures
    directly, allows for great flexibility. The intention was to reproduce documents
    exactly as they were produced in the 18th century. I feel very confident I have
    achieved this goal. Almost all of the MUFI fonts have the required ligatures;
    which one is used is entirely irrelevant to me.

  body: What? You're telling me they didn't have browsers in the 18th century? That
    was just a little show in the title. I think some of us are missing the point.
    The point is that there is a significant percentage of mankind's printed works
    (from the beginning of the printing press to early 19th century) which was produced
    in this manner. 33 million pages from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online
    (ECCO parts I and II) and another million pages in the Burney Collection of newspapers
    to quote two sources only. To be able to see this exactly as it was printed and
    then switch to a format that is easier for the modern reader (dberlow excepted)
    to enjoy is, for me, a huge bonus.
