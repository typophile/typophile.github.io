body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/passedtest.jpg]\r\nIt took this woman 33
  years to pass a UK car driving test. \r\n\r\nI passed the written car test with
  2 wrong out of 35 questions, and passed the practical driving test with only 4 marks,
  (mostly for not looking in the mirrors in the correct order or something) which
  is considered very good since if you get 17 marks you fail.\r\n\r\nPassed my motorcycle
  with only 1 incorrect answer out of the 35. Let's see how the practical goes very
  soon....\r\n \r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/4422356.stm"
