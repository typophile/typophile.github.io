  one or two spot colors) at high quality?\r\n\r\nCan anyone here post some estimated
  rates you guys have gotten from these printers?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    print broker, that offers quick turn-around, cheap prices, and very high quality
    (he only deals with top quality printers).\r\n\r\nAs a print broker, he can beat
    any printer's direct pricing, because of his large volume all year round.\r\n\r\nAaron
    offers delivery too. So, you can send him PDF files and payment, and get the printed
    stuff back very soon. 1, 2, 3, 4 color CYMK, with optional Gold or Silver too."

  body: "Aaron's email address is: mp770@aol.com\r\n\r\nHe has many references and
    lots of satisfied customers, as he has been doing this for over 10 years. He works
    with many many printers in all the boroughs, but mainly in Queens and Brooklyn\r\n\r\nAaron
    needs to know if the job is: \r\n\r\none-sided or two-sided,\r\nknown in printer-talk
    as 4 over 1, or 4 over zero, \r\nif the job is 4 colors on one side,\r\nand either
    1 color (usually black) or no color on the other side;\r\n\r\nthe size if the
    print run, like a thousand copies or ten thousand copies;\r\n\r\nthe cut size
    of the paper, like 6 inches by 9 inches (standard for books),\r\nor 8.5 inches
    by 11 inches (like many magazines),\r\nor 11 inches by 17 inches (like many newspapers);\r\n\r\nthe
    quality of the paper, such as thickness and finish (glossy, flat, or matted);\r\n\r\ntrims
    and folds.\r\n\r\nAll these factors effect the quote.\r\n\r\nIf it seems over-whelming,
    talk to him about your needs. Better than a printer, he will brainstorm with you,
    and recommend what is best for you. Unfortunately, most printers want to make
    a quick buck, and don't really care if that's what you want. Aaron wants you most
    to become a happy customer. And a happy customer will become a repeat customer."
