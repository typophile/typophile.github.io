body: "first question:\r\nis there a technique for rounding glyph corners without
  distorting the rest of the glyph using FontLab or Illustrator?\r\n\r\nwhat i mean
  by this is how to make round corners on a P, D, B and other glyphs that have both
  straight lines and curves, but without changing the curves -- just the corners.\r\n\r\nsecond
  question:\r\nhow to create a rounded corner from a corner that consists of a straight
  line and a curve?\r\n"

  body: that's beautiful but still more complicated then it should be. i found i way
    to round  corners with a simple FontLab action, but regretably, the action changes
    the glyph curves, as well. in Illustrator it's even more complicated -- you have
    to use the Outline  Path function crawling menus and dialogs in multiple steps.

  body: "I found a really cool [[http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html|Illustrator
    script for rounding corners]]. It rounds selected corners, and leaves anything
    else untouched. In the short time I've been using it, I haven't seen it distort
    anything.\r\n\r\n"

  body: <a href="http://www.cvalley.com/products/xtreampath/">Xtream Path</a> is an
    Illustrator plug-in that lets you do practically any kind of round corner thing
    you want, plus a lot of other neat stuff. It's not free, but its flexible and
    easy to use. It'd be great if somebody did something like it for FontLab. I'd
    buy it.
