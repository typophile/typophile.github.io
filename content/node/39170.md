  based in Germany. \"Oving\" is the guy's name and \"Lichttechnik\" means \"Light
  engineering\". For the type I used Myriad and then customised all letters except
  \"v\". Please let me know how you like it and what could be improved. Cheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5377.png]"

    logos, and  rarely work well.\r\n\r\nBut, the worst problem I see is that it reads
    \"Qving.\""

  body: I read it as Qving too. Your pic really does look like Tintin. I am glad someone
    does. :-) But back to the logo. I would keep trying more ideas. If you a jam for
    timeI suggest that you loose the connection to the O and let the Letters be their
    regular shapes and heavily  letterspace the caps out under Oving. But if you have
    some time I would keep brainstorming & see what you think of.

  body: "  Yeah, but what about Q_ and that ugly cut_?\r\n\r\n\\ now correct spacing
    between \"Oving\" and the \"LICHTTECHNIK\".\r\n\\ The dot on the letter \"i\"
    is too low.\r\n\\ Myriad is a one of its kind, please don't mess with it. \r\n
    \ Use em properly and it will look awesome by default.\r\n\r\n  Right now, it
    looks like you have used a total 4 \r\n  typefaces in one logo. The visual language
    of Q, vi, ng and \r\n  the LICHTTECHNIK is completely different from each other.\r\n
    \ Try to do something so that it looks a part of a family even \r\n  if you edit
    them.\r\n\\ Also at the bottom its looking a bit weired cause one side(O) is very
    \r\n  edgy yet the another side(g) is too roundish. And on the top its vice-versa.\r\n\\
    You will get some valuable feedback from other Typophiles too.\r\n\r\n  All the
    best.\r\n  Satya_"

    here. First of all it has to communicate a clear idea. I'm not sure it does with
    this concept.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd do would be to explore as many diverse ideas as
    possible, without spending too much time on finetuning forms. The formal details
    can be resolved once you feel confident about any of those routes."

  body: "I disagree with a lot of what\u2019s been said, except for the Qving problem.
    I think that the chunky letters with the connection below have a strong mechanical
    feel that\u2019s entirely appropriate to a lighting technician. The same goes
    for the idea of using a gradient\u2014I think that have a lit version of the logo
    for the internet and color printing and a plain version for single-color use is
    a great idea, albeit one that needs to be carried out very carefully with some
    overlaid shapes in illustrator."

    the details'"

    it can be. It's about what you get rid of, not what you keep. The more convoluted
    the concept becomes, the less successful the logo will be.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oving_ideas_5567.gif]\r\n\r\nSatya:
    <cite>Myriad is a one of its kind, please don\u2019t mess with it.\r\nUse em properly
    and it will look awesome by default.</cite>\r\n\r\nDon't use any typeface in a
    default way when in a logo! As a bare minimum the spacing needs to be adjusted.
    There is no harm in modification of the forms as long as they end up looking like
    they belong together.\r\n\r\nGood luck"

  body: Maybe you could work the tail of the g into an electric cord underlining the
    rest of the font to add to the "light/lighting/electrical" feel.  I'm trying to
    think of how to make my idea not look cheesy and I'm a bit stuck. :\
