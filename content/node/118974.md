  body: 'Me too but Garamond is not as wide if you look at the Os and the right vertical
    on the M is not thick enough. If you try semibold or bold, it gets too thick.
    Wasn''t able to get it with tweaking the horizontal scale either. Thoughts? Thanks. '

  body: "Bobby, if you go to Myfonts.com and type in Garamond in the search field
    (or just follow the link above), you'll see more than 170 typefaces whose name
    contains Garamond or are based on/influenced by Garamond.\r\n\r\nThere are dozens
    of variations of the typeface itself, from Adobe Garamond to Simoncini Garamond,
    and knock-off faces under alternate names. Given that your sample is only 14 pixels
    tall (about one tenth the height needed to do a search via a visual font database),
    matching it exactly will be difficult.\r\n\r\nThe ampersand, however, is pretty
    distinctive (small upper counter, smaller right tail), and may be the best place
    to focus.\r\n\r\nGaramond No. 2 and Berthold Garamond look promising."

  body: Thanks Kevin. Couldn't have said it better :) That's why I said 'a' Garamond
    ;) And to me there's no need to search longer when [[http://myfonts.us/td-wBXFkD|Adobe
    Garamond]] looks to match almost perfectly (at this size at least ;).
