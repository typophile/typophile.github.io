body: I thought you should all be aware of Nate&#39;s excellent comic lettering, so
  i suggested that he post his monthly newsletter here in the News &amp; Events section.
  I love his stuff! Makes me wish i were a comic book artist so I could have an excuse
  to use some of his fonts. Anyhow I was excited to see Blambot on here and couldn&#39;t
  hold it in, so that&#39;s that... <BR>Are you still using Comic Sans? There&#39;s
  no need! You can get the real deal from Blambot!
