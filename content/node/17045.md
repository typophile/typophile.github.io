  body: "We like to call the \"bastard title\" the half-title. It's more polite.\r\n\r\nThe
    copyright traditionally is supposed to go on the back side of the title page (that
    is, page iv) but it can also be the very last page of the book. It can't go anywhere
    else as far as I know.\r\n\r\nThe rules about contents pages and openers always
    beginning on the recto (right hand page) are pretty loose these days, especially
    in illustrated book publishing. You can certainly design the table of contents
    to run across a spread."

    body: "Thanks, \r\n\r\nI've designed a book within a book, which is to say that
      I have a larger book that surrounds a smaller book. I've been making a puzzle
      book using  words that end with another word so for example 'Smoking' or 'carriage'.\r\n\r\nThe
      second part of the word is set in the inner book with the outer book representing
      the first part of the word. I've printed the words onto various types of paper
      to work with layering and seeing other words appear through layers of tracing
      paper and accetate, thicker card and paper with texture, each paper or print
      being relevant to the word and it's meaning. It's been a nightmare pagenating
      (sp?) it all and then I realised I'd forgotten the prelims and so now I'm putting
      them in. \r\n\r\nI only knew the half title page as a bastard title page as
      that is what I've been taught, half title is much more polite I agree :) "

    me of Morison's insistence that one of the reasons JvK's Cancellaresca Bastarda
    failed in the market was that people were mistakenly pronouncing the \"s\" in
    the second word, while it should be silent. As if it were an Argentinian font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
