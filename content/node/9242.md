body: From London- I am guessing. The text dates it at 1592. I think it is in stone.
  It might be wood. It is a gold rubbing that I have in my house. This image has been
  enhanced to help the possible identification. Good luck. I think there are some
  intersting issues with this specimen.  <BR>   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6531.gif"

  body: The &#34;W&#34; is not of a Caslon I have seen. The &#34;g&#34; is way different
    and the&#34;Y&#34; is not the same.  &#34;d&#34; does not match.  <BR>    <BR>The
    x-height is much lower than Caslon. <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: Hmm... I was only giving you a suggestion. This is obviously hand drawn letterforms.
    Do you just want something close? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/historicals/index.html"

    target="_blank"> Caslon Antique?</a> <BR> <BR>The &#39;W&#39; isn&#39;t correct,
    but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/telegdi/" target="_blank"> this</a>
    is still interesting. <BR> <BR>What are you trying for?? Exact match or mood?

  body: Well, to be honest, if I can&#39;t find a match I was thinking of digitizing
    it. So I am just researching I guess.  <BR> <BR>Do you think this would be worthy
    or a waste? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help so far Tiffany. <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: 'I think it has some curious and affecting characteristics. I also think if
    you could find more scrap, so to speak, from the same time period, it could become
    a provocative vernacular-like revival. For instance, studying all of the tombstones
    around and in Boston, and then developing a face. <BR> <BR>IMHO '
