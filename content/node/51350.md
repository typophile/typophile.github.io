  body: "JazzyB and barthak,\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick answer. You both are right,
    it is a manually slanted roman!! I ruled out Myriad, one of my candidates after
    looking at the Roman, because the Myriad Italic is totally different. Also, I
    ruled out Frutiger for the obvious difference in the i point, but I forgot about
    Segoe.\r\n\r\nI will check both of them. Thanks a lot."
