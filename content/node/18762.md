    a deal with the prolific digitizer <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/">Dieter

    they did. the book includes the most common blackletter fonts (fontshop, linotype
    etc.) and has 2 sections about more modern blackletter interpretations. When I'm
    back home I'll search after the list of the fonts on the cd.\r\n\r\nj\xFCrgen
    siebert from http://www.fontblog.de has more pic of the book and a small making
    of for all german readers."

    contributed fonts, but none are licensed elsewhere for a fee (at least not from
    FontShop). So it's not a CD of commercial fonts.\r\n\r\nHe has just <a href=\"http://www.fontblog.de/index.html#unique-entry-id-154\">made
    a PDF available</a> showing all the fonts on the CD."

  body: "Thanks Stephen. You are so fast ... even in the middle of the night. No chance
    for me to announce my PDF myself ;-)\r\nBut I like to translate some of my German
    notes. All fonts are for Mac OS X and Windows, except Tannenberg (Windows Type
    1 only). More than 95 % of the fonts carry the famous long s. The fonts seem to
    work well. I had a crash (Mac, InDesign CS 2, FontExpolrer X) when loading all
    150 fonts and my PDF was nearly finished, but who the hell is working with 150
    blackletter fonts simultaneously? Some of the fonts (10 - 15 %) are not embeddable.
    That makes my file huge, because I converted most of the showings to path. The
    PDF is 3.9 MB. Have fun ..."
