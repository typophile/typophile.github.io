  body: "Twer it me typedog, I would standardize the spacing between the letters (give
    them some air), and then I would futz with the \"counters,\" or interior spaces
    (open them up!!!), to reflect the spacing. That may counter the unfortunate double
    r's and z which unfortunately bring quite a bit of space to the equation. What
    I am saying is that there needs to be some daylight! You could probably heavy
    up the horizontals of the z's a tad also.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Typerror and Bert both make good points...and I would suggest you definitely
    check your kerning on GUERRIZMO. I would also maybe bump up the weight of the
    rest of the text, because it looks mighty thin compared to your heavy type logo.
    For the G on the back, have you thought about using the same type as you have
    on GUERRIZMO? Throwing in a third typeface, like you have done, really separates
    the card into a Front and Back, instead of seeing this card as one complete unit.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

    to make the card as simple as possible because I not only work with younger people
