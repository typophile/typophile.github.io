  about what graphic design conference I shouldn't miss. I can't make it to typecon
  this year and are also looking for something wider that (do I dare) \"just\" type.
  Now I love type - I do - but It's a long way from copenhagen and I wan't my moneys
  worth... if you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nSo should I just wait for next years typecon
  or is there something out there that is really cool attending? The obvious as well
  because I really have no idea about this...\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nMark,\r\nCopenhagen"

    design conference I shouldn't miss.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's not graphic design per se,
    but it IS related. Have you considered the <strong>International Calligraphy Conference?</strong>
    If you have any interest at all regarding letterforms, then I would say don't
    miss this. I think anyone who loves to design type should go to at least one of
    these conferences in their life time.\r\n\r\nThis year it's in Boston in late
    July. It's not your typical conference. It's very hands on, focusing on learning
    as much as possible in the Lettering Arts. Workshops all week by the top designers
    in the world. Back in 1997 Jovica Veljovic taught Font Design. This year I plan
    to take Stephen Rapp's Font Lab workshop (since I'm just now learning how to use
    it).\r\n\r\nSome of the benefits:\r\n<li> It's not expensive... $1300.00 (US)
    covers food, lodging and workshops.\r\n<li> It's a week long with plenty of extra
    activities in the evenings (ie. lectures, parties, etc)\r\n<li>Meet top professionals
    and see them work.\r\n<li> The gallery of participants' work is amazing.</li>\r\n---\r\nThe
    last conference I went to was in 2004 (I taught a couple of workshops, but had
    plenty of time to soak in all the things happening around me). When I got back,
    I was inspired for weeks.\r\n\r\nYou can get more info at the Odyssey website:\r\nhttp://www.2010calligraphyconference.com/"
