body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI've been working on this logo for APCTP the past few days, its
  for an association that is responsible for the development and management of 4 Science
  and Technology parks in the northern Portugal. Its an half public half private association.
  The parks offer space and special facilities to the companies that decide to join
  them, they have joint resources, shared equipment conference rooms, spa, restaurants,
  etc.\r\n\r\nThe kite was selected because of some historical background, like Benjamin
  Franklin s kite, and although it is a very simple object and shape, it has several
  utilities from fun to science.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to avoid a too technological
  approach in term of visual language,trying to bypass the grid like typography from
  computer screens and mobile phones, or the analogical/digital retro, although I've
  been testing it with some of these fonts, as an assurance.\r\n\r\nThe version presented
  here is a sketch, and if possible I would like to hear some opinions\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRui

  body: "Is the logo the entire thing, including the sky-blue rectangular background?\r\n\r\nIf
    so, I think there's too much whitespace (or should I say bluespace?). The tagline
    at the bottom is cramped, and the text is too small. If you shrink the logo down,
    the tagline becomes unreadable."

    body: "You're totally right about the type, I mistreated it by compromising the
      readability of the lower text. One of the problems is that the logo APCTP is
      not self explanatory because its not a well known association so its mandatory
      to include always the bellow text, but I'll work on a different set and proportion.\r\n\r\nAbout
      the blue space the idea was to simulate the idea of a landscape an horizon,
      but it needs to be improved.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway"

  body: "I think that's a definite improvement. The text is very long, so breaking
    it into two lines seems to be a necessity. I'm not sure about the second line
    having the dashes on either side, though.\r\n\r\nAlthough the type is bigger,
    it is now too light; it will still become unreadable if the logo is rendered small.
    I wonder if you could get away with eliminating the text as part of the logo per
    se, and instead supplying it as a separate element (optional, depending on the
    context).\r\n\r\nThe new <cite>APCTP</cite> has more character. I agree with you
    that the <cite>C</cite> still needs work; in particular, it seems too squarish
    compared to the <cite>P</cite>. Also, the crossbar on the <cite>T</cite> looks
    too thin."

    the quarters of the kite, I think moving it up and curving it would add to the
    fun element. You might need to consider three lines for the full title if it is
    required at small sizes, it might actually break better (sense-wise) ASSOCIA\xC7\xC3O
    DO PARQUE/DE CI\xCANCIA E TECNOLOGIA/DO PORTO or moving two lines to the right
    and enlarging it.\r\nTim"

  body: The string needs to connect in the center of the four panels for it to look
    like a kite. Also, the typical iconic kite also has a tail. Not sure if you can
    work that in without things getting too busy, though.

    has helped (it could be presented alongside the logo on three lines, if necessary).\r\n\r\nHave
    you tried grounding the letters to the green. Overlapping the letters over a part
    of the kite. Flopping the direction of the kite.\r\n\r\nJust some things that
    might look nice."

  body: 'Rui, the version posted on the 27th of August has more potential, IMHO, than
    does the latest. I second Dan''s suggestion for a tail on the kite. I think that
    if you got rid of the box and allowed the kite to float freely the whole thing
    would be more organic and less rigid. You could, for instance, do the acronym,
    string and tail in the light green ... or the acronym in the blue. But I think
    you''d find getting rid of the box helps loosen it all up. '
