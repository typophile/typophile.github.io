		<div class="commentbody"><p>Arno is what you might call a modernized Venetian oldstyle. I think of it as having the same relationship to Adobe Jenson that Minion has to Garamond Premier. It&rsquo;s an upcoming design from Robert Slimbach with the level of language support and typographic features you might expect from a new Adobe Original typeface these days.</p>
<p>Note: I don&rsquo;t think the version bundled with the Photoshop CS3 public beta was final. For now, consider it beta, like the application itself.</p>

<p>I personally love the small caps and italics, and the caps for &ldquo;P&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q,&rdquo; but find that the serif is rather intrusive on almost everything else, unlike Adobe Jenson.  Anyone else find it uncomfortable?</p>
<p>(The cap &ldquo;P&rdquo; in particular reminds me of the current ad on our local transit for the DVD release of &ldquo;The Devil Wears Prada&rdquo; although I&rsquo;m not enamoured of the rest of the ad&hellip;. )</p>

<p>Note that Arno Pro is not being bundled &ldquo;instead of&rdquo; Adobe Jenson Pro. Photoshop CS2 had no bundled fonts.</p>

<li>
<p>Linda, are you commenting on the upright capitals or the italics? The italic sample Dan posted has the swash alternates on, not the default italics. The roman sample was an enlarged version of the 12 point version of the font; the display version has much less obtrusive serifs, of course.</p>

<p>But the fonts bundled with the beta seem to be the regular core Adobe fonts, sans any version of Adobe Jenson Pro. I would rather have that in lieu of having two different Garamonds.</p>

<p>The upright capitals, for the comment about the serif.  I figured the italic was the alternates &ndash; that Z gave it away.  :-)  I must admit that the Light version is quite elegant.</p>

<p>AFAIK, Slimbach only looks at other typefaces when he wants to make sure he&rsquo;s not doing something that someone else already did. That seems to be the only way other people&rsquo;s work influence his (unless he&rsquo;s doing a revival).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that is true of any artist or designer, ever. I am a big admirer of Slimbach&rsquo;s work, but everyone is influenced by what they see.  For example, above Thomas Phinney sees some relation of Garamond and Minion. I do too. I may be wrong about Trinité being an influence&ndash;it might be something else&ndash;but everybody is influenced.</p>
<p>This is not to deny that Arno is a new design. It&rsquo;s just that everyone is influenced by past ideas.</p>

<p>i think it&rsquo;s inevitable to rework your own stuff. i often find that i want to do at least 2 versions of of typeface and often more. sometimes the changes you want to make are enough to make the typeface into something entirely new. sometimes you want to go back to a typeface you&rsquo;ve worked on in the past and apply accumulated experience to redoing a new version, and it turns out to be something significantly different, ala Proxima Nova, Maple or Apex New.</p>

<p>Thomas, surely you are not saying that Slimbach spent zero time and effort studying Garamond and Jenson. And if I read you rightly you acknowledge an influence of Garamond on Minion and Jenson on Arno. So you seem to be contradicting what Miguel said when he wrote that Slimbach is only influenced by other&rsquo;s work when &ldquo;he&rsquo;s doing a revival&rdquo;. 
Yet you say &ldquo;what Miguel said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am puzzled.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that Stephen Coles was implying any influence of Hoefler on Slimbach, just that they were striving for the same kind of aesthetic quality&ndash;a highly elegant look, with a touch of calligraphic influence, or some such. And indeed I find it far-fetched that Hoefler has had any influence on Slimbach.</p>
<p>I do think Slimbach has had more recent influences than Garamond and Jenson, though. I find it hard to imagine that Myriad could have be created as it is without Frutiger&rsquo;s prior and ground-breaking creation of his self-named typeface. Though Myriad is a significantly different design, I think almost all type designers&ndash;probably including Slimbach and Frutiger&ndash;would agree that Frutiger&rsquo;s design had a significant influence on Myriad, and not just by reaction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that acknowledging such influences takes away anything at all from Slimbach&rsquo;s greatness as a type designer. For me he is one of the handful of greatest at work today.</p>

<p>I think that acknowledging influences is a fine thing, and I don&rsquo;t think that being influenced is bad. I&rsquo;m just saying that more of what Robert does (in non-revival faces) is coming from his own head.

<p>from the last quarter-century</p>

<p>So far as I have learned, in general creative work is strongly informed by the work of the previous generation in the field, both by direct influence and reaction. Once creative thinkers and workers are beyond their formative stages&ndash;in which they are indeed decisively influenced&ndash;they often are driven more by their own creative program for themselves, and the  needs of the broader culture, rather than their peers. Hence Thomas&rsquo;s observation about Slimbach is plausible to me.</p>
<p>Still, people usually have an awareness of their peers and sometimes a competitiveness, though this varies with the person. And I think it is quite difficult even for a person himself or herself to be fully aware of influences, past or peers. As David noted, such influences may be unconscious, but none the less real.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It was something we were experimenting with in pre-release versions, but it did not make it into the final fonts.</p>
<p>Although the new naming convention worked well for most typographers among our testers, to whom its usage was obvious, overall it caused increased confusion. Less typographically savvy users were particularly uncertain about how to deal with it.</p>
<p>For Adobe, it also introduced a legacy issue: what would we do with the existing fonts with the older optical-size naming convention? Either we change their style names - a major break in compatibility - or we live with two different standards.</p>
<p>In the end, we decided that simply keeping with the existing scheme was the best of the alternatives. For Arno, we minted a new size name of &ldquo;small text&rdquo; in between &ldquo;caption&rdquo; and &ldquo;regular,&rdquo; for the 10 pt optical size. Although we might come up with new names, simply prefixing &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;large&rdquo; in front of the existing labels would give us enough optical sizes to play with for pretty much any purpose.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What a beautiful font! You guys know too much; x-heights and the Venetian influence are a distraction to identifying this font. In the dimension that is pure Slimbach, without historical precedent, I see &ldquo;Arno&rdquo; as a contraction of &ldquo;Warnock&rdquo;, interpolating between that font and Minion.</p>
<p>I must confess to having downloaded the CS3 beta just to get a first look at Arno Pro. I use TeX and LaTeX for mathematical typesetting, so the digital equivalent of struggling to get the cellophane off the next Beatles LP is a half hour of shell scripting and writing font description files. My conclusion: I need to wait for the remaining light opticals, if they&rsquo;re coming. ArnoPro-Light36pt can&rsquo;t be intended for 11pt body text.</p>
<p>To my naive eye, light fonts seem to be in identity crisis now. Are they supposed to &ldquo;look&rdquo; light on the page, or offer a reasonable alternative to regular? One sees good examples of each view. I&rsquo;m writing a textbook to either be viewed on screen or laser printed. After many experiments I&rsquo;ve concluded that most regular fonts are too heavy, reflecting a historical traditon that predates high resolution screens and printing. The only font that I can stay with for more than an hour of writing is Warnock Pro Light.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m dying of curiousity to see the rest of the ArnoPro light series. The regular has such an authority on the page, with its weight perfectly balancing the glyph shapes, that I fear the light series will opt to &ldquo;look&rdquo; light, and not vie for the same authority on the page.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath. Arno Pro&rsquo;s Light weight is only intended for Display (above 22pt) sizes.</p>
<p>Tiffany is right. It&rsquo;d be nonsense to have a &ldquo;Light Caption&rdquo; weight, for example.</p>

<p>I worked on the production of Arno Pro, and there was never a plan for a &ldquo;Light series&rdquo;. Perhaps Robert thinks the design, design space or style doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to it. I can ask him, if you want.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Garamond Premier Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Robert&rsquo;s work prior to Arno Pro, only has Light Display as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks all! While I think Arno Pro is an amazing font, I&rsquo;ll stay with Warnock Pro light for math typesetting, which harmonizes well with Hermann Zapf&rsquo;s Euler math fonts.</p>
<p>Even Warnock Pro light falls apart a bit on a 600 dpi laser printer. It looks great at 1200 dpi. Maybe in another decade fonts will be generally be a bit lighter, to match future displays and printers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi&hellip; 
it&rsquo;s my debut in typophile, and I&rsquo;m happy that I start it speaking about Robert Slimbach.
As a graphic designer I must say Robert still surprises me after all those great typefaces he had done. 
Arno is wonderful. Congratulations to him and to the ones who worked with him in Arno Pro.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Welcome to Typophile! An interesting thing about Arno Pro, as attested by Thomas Phinney, is that the version we see is only a beta version.</p>
<p>When I showed him a piece of work that I did with it, it took him a second to figure it out because the current version&rsquo;s lower case e is now totally different! Who would have thought that there could be more to work on that would totally change the appearance of a typeface, especially on a typeface that for anyone other than Slimbach would&rsquo;ve been complete a long time ago&hellip;</p>

<p>I really look forward to the actual release of the typeface. It will ship in the boxes with the next Creative Suite and the CS applications, so the March 27th launch should reveal the availability date.</p>
