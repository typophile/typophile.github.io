body: I can feel vibes of displeasure from some people regarding <BR>the Critique
  threads, and it&#39;s coming out in <BR>little barbs and jabs. <BR> <BR>Consider
  me jabbed. <BR> <BR>So I thought I&#39;d clarify. <BR> <BR>1. I am not the one who
  proffered the <BR>notion of it not being &#39;okay&#39; to post your own logo versions
  in <BR>another person&#39;s thread. <BR> <BR>If I remember correctly, Joe &#40;Joseph
  Pemberton&#41; was the first to say something <BR>to the effect of, &#34;Let people
  do their own work!&#34; <BR> <BR>It made sense, and I took that as an edict. <BR>
  <BR>In another thread, Stephen lamented about the practice, calling it selfish,
  if i remember correctly. <BR> <BR>So... <BR> <BR>1. The posting of Joe and Stephen
  curtails. <BR>2. New typophiles join who don&#39;t know of the edict. <BR>3. Posting
  work in someone else&#39;s thread becomes the norm. <BR> <BR>I thought it was the
  right thing to do to speak up ...  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25795.html?1076278621"

  <BR> <BR>So if anyone would like to discuss, please feel free. <BR> <BR>My opinion
  is that the practice is okay if you ask offline. Very simple. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d appreciate
  it if you&#39;d use this thread as a forum to <BR>voice your opinions ... <BR> <BR>thanks,
  <BR> <BR>bj

  body: I don&#39;t feel no vibes. <BR> <BR>That said, I do agree that it&#39;s better
    to ask the individual &#40;but not some Grand Typophile Council&#41; if it&#39;s
    OK before doing it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: What about an icon or a word that indicates whether it is ok to post your
    own versions? Or a note in the &#34;start new thread&#34; window? I don&#39;t
    have a problem with it myself.  <BR> <BR>kris.

  body: Being that we are all visual, it is often easier &#40;I&#39;m guilty&#41;
    to take what someone has posted and manipulate it until it is what we think it
    should be. However, from a teacher&#39;s point of view, I can also see how this
    is not the most direct path to learning on the part of the student. That said,
    I agree with Kris&#39; idea of an icon. That way no one has to ask offline &#40;although
    this is good&#41; ... and we can all play with one another nicely. <BR> <BR>

  body: I think that would be perfectly legit and welcome &#40;at least for me&#41;
    for other people to remix my samples to show what they&#39;d do. How is that any
    different than making a suggestion?

  body: personaly i don&#39;t see how a visual/graphic critique is any different from
    a written/verbal one. in any case a critique is just a suggestion which one is
    free to accept or reject. everyone has opinions and insight to offer, not all
    you will agree with. making final decisions allows the person whose work is being
    critiqued to &#34;own&#34; their design &#40;at least that would work for me emotionaly&#41;
    for example, if someone recommends a certain typeface for a project and someone
    else says the same face would be a bad idea, i have to come to the final conclusion
    of whether to use it or not. the final decision is mine, my own. i always appreciate
    any comments, critique that anyone on here has to offer and take them all with
    a grain of salt... from what i&#39;ve experienced here we&#39;re all capbable
    of playing nice and if the person whose work is being critiqued doesn&#39;t want
    certain types of suggestions, they can always request that they not be made, but
    then what&#39;s the purpose of the critique?

  body: One complication is crediting. If you use a logo that&#39;s due in large part
    to the contributions of certain individuals &#40;or Typophile in general&#41;
    where/how do you give proper credit? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I think there&#39;s more value in manipulating the curve of a letter to match
    a verbal suggestion, tweaking it until you think it&#39;s right, than simply changing
    your work to match the sample of someone who suggested an improvement. <BR> <BR>Randy
    Jones does a great job on his critiques. He uses sketching to point out areas
    that could be improved, and offers general direction on how to do it. But he doesn&#39;t
    redraw characters &#40;or logos or...&#41; for anyone.

  body: I&#39;ve offered visuals as examples, so I&#39;m &#39;guilty&#39; in this
    case. Offering professional help means opening yourself up to giving away what
    you normally get paid for. It may be &#39;bad form&#39; to do it here, but how
    often do you sketch something for a colleague at your office rather than verbally
    articulate it because it&#39;s just easier? It&#39;s the difference between a
    quick sketch &#40;digital or otherwise&#41; and a fully refined &#39;suggestion&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>We&#39;re visual, so it makes sense that this happens. <BR> <BR>But,
    I see how it gets out of control sometimes. I agree that an icon/ standard invitation
    to sketch will probably diffuse the issue.
