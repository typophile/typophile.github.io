body: "Hello everyone, \r\nI'm working on a wayfinding project, within the constraints
  of a signage design standard that was developed by someone else. I'm given to wonder
  how I would do it differently typographically, given the opportunity, so I'd like
  to refer to some good signage standards, and see the choices other people have made.
  Does anyone know of any which are available publicly, or any good books about it?
  Standards tend to be private documents, kept in-house, so it's difficult to get
  hold of them, and there are also intellectual property issues.  \r\nI've seen some
  good examples in Signage Systems and Information Graphics by Andreas Uebele, and
  Wayshowing by Per Mollerup. Also, London Underground lets people download its design
  standards as pdfs, and I\u2019ve seen the BAA signage standard (Heathrow etc). There
  is an interesting book from the late 60s called A Sign Systems Manual by Fletcher/Forbes/Crosby,
  which features a custom typeface designed by Matthew Carter. \r\nI\u2019m particularly
  interested in how things such as line- and letterspacing are decided and specified,
  choices of typefaces, light/dark relationships, type sizes for reading distances,
  etc. In terms of airports, I\u2019m very curious about the Zuerich and Munich systems,
  designed by Ruedi Ruegg and Otl Aicher respectively, and more recent systems such
  as Madrid (I don\u2019t know who did this, but they had to juggle three languages).
  If anyone can shed any light on anything I\u2019ve mentioned, I\u2019d be very grateful.
  \r\n"

    As for your particulars, I\u2019ve found some of that in articles related to designing
    typefaces for signs than articles about sign design. There\u2019s some good tidbits
    in the <a href=\"http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/index.php\">ClearviewHWY
    research area</a>. Spiekermann\u2019s essay <em>Infography</em> has some nice
    nuggets; I know that it\u2019s in <em>Made With FontFont</em>, I don\u2019t see
    it online.\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if you could work this stuff\u2014even
    just a list of sources\u2014into the Typowiki when you have a chance!"

    my memory.  \r\nJames: Thanks, I'll go and find the Infography article you mention.
    I would like to compile a wiki, if people are interested, but I don't know how
    to. How does one start something like that? "

    easy, just look at existing articles.

    they had to juggle three languages)\"\r\n\r\nThe last few times I've been to Madrid-Barajas
    the signage has been in English and Spanish only (as well as Metro line 8).  Spanish
    in larger colored text with the English in smaller white text (metro uses a lighter
    face with a smaller size for the English).  The Barcelona airport is trilingual
    last time I was there (though it's been a while and I don't foresee going there
    again thanks to the AVE) in Catalonian, Castilian Spanish and English but I don't
    remember the style set up.\r\n\r\nIn the Metro, Madrid has suffered from someone
    accidentally switched from Helvetica to Arial.  Needless to say when signs next
    to each other or even with a sign it's mixed, it doesn't look good (see Line 10's
    upcoming stops board).  But I think it was a temporary problem as the most recent
    signs (the new vitrex signs for Line 5) are in Helvetica Bold, the last ones to
    be all in Arial were the Line 6 boards indicating which platform goes where.\r\n\r\nColor
    wise is the main point of contention on the Madrid system.  Green is information,
    Blue is neutral background.  Grey is miscellaneous information and Red is pertinent/important/advisory
    information.  Yellow is construction/renovation work.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro
