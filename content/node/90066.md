  original font is - I can't even begin to tell you how many fonts I've viewed, looking
  for something close (oh, yes I can - I have looked at 5856 fonts, PLUS several on-line
  resources!)\r\n\r\nNow I'm compelled, to preserve my own sanity, to ask (make that
  BEG) for some guidance, assistance, help or even a \"you're in deep doo-doo\" message...\r\n\r\nAnyone
  ever seen this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
