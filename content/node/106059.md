  body: Looks like some sort of DIN, yes but some details (/6 and /9 counters connection
    to vertical stems; /C and /G terminals...) make me thinking it's a mix of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/parachute+din|Parachute
    DIN]] Text and Display. There're at least 2 different sets of digits. One could
    come from [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/pf+din+text|DIN Text PF]] (for this
    [[http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles19/2500597/projects/9101801/9bbfca177358112b22212ff779130203.jpg|sample]])
    and one from [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/pf+din+display|DIN Display PF]] (for
    this [[http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles19/2500597/projects/9101801/0e429aa7e6eb6b544a46b47bb40970b8.png|sample]],
    digits and text in various weights). Note the difference on these samples between
    the two /2.
