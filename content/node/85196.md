  writing system) orthography (3 glyphs right on the picture).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/top_6196.ht2.jpg]\r\n\r\n
  From what I understand, left on the picture are 3 modern hangul sans serifs meaning
  'kuk sul do', and on the right is some sort of a traditional hangul writing system
  which is totally unfamiliar to me. I was told it means 'kuk sul do', too. So, basically
  I would need precise information how is this orthography called.\r\n\r\nSo if there
  is a korean ninja somewhere around, help would be much appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: "Both of them do say 'Kuk Sul Do'. On the left it is in Hangul (Korean letters)
    and on the right, Chinese characters. It means 'The Way of the National Art'.
    Wikipedia claims that it means 'National Korean Martial Art' but that would be
    \uAD6D\uB9BD \uD55C\uAD6D\uC5B4 \uBB34\uC220 (Kuk Lip Han Kuk Uh Mu Sul). (Mu
    Sul means martial art. Han Kuk is Korea.)\r\n\r\n(And no, I'm not a Korean ninja.
    There's no such thing, although I do practise taekwondo\u2014\uD0DC\uAD8C\uB3C4
