body: "hi all,\r\n\r\nanyone can identify the font used in the logo and subline/copy?\r\n\r\ni'm
  not sure but the logo might be hand drawn? for the rest of the text, i know i've
  seen that \"r\" before, but i can't remember. the one in those black circles also
  looks different from the one used in the subline. any ideas?\r\n\r\nthanks: lars"
