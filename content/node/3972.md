  body: Hi Hildebrant, check out <a href="http://xplane.com/xplanations/executive/"
    target="_blank"> these guys</a> at xplane.com. They ran a full-page ad in the
    2003 Fortune 500 issue of Fortune Magazine, so it&#39;s possible they might be
    more  &#40;expensive&#41; than you want or need. IMHO still worth a look, though.
