  on that note... what do you think of it? I happen to really like it. It's clean,
  sophisticated and finally ditches the stodgy serif letters which I find to be severely
  dated. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newCBS_5968.jpg]"

    various of their shows. Maybe I'm mixing them up with NBC, which I think has been
    using something that seems similar.\r\n\r\nI took Stephen's remark as a humorous
    compliment about how good you usually are at making these ID's, Jan. I know he
    would never make fun of one of the 'stars' here.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    and me seem to have a little dispute about where to link. I took it as He-doesn\u2019t-know-the-good-quality-type-because-he-only-lurks-around-MyFonts.\r\nMisinterpretation
    probably.\r\nI don\u2019t consider myself to be one of the <em>stars</em> here,
    though. There are a lot of people around here that know a lot more, and that includes
    Stephen and you."
