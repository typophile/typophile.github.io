body: Has anyone ever experienced a vertical shift in the alignement of fonts when
  documents are ported from Mac to Win, or vice versa? I am referring to Quark 4.1
  and 5. This of course only happens if the top is aligned with the box. It does not
  happen with fonts that are set to baseline grid. What I am seeing is that on Win
  the fonts are aligned at cap height, whilst on Mac they are set on ascender. <BR>It
  has nothing to do with the alignement info since that only affects fonts that are
  actually part of the Quark font database. <BR> <BR>Bruno Maag <BR>Dalton Maag Ltd
