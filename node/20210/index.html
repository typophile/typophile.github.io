  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to the site (my first post) but after looking around I love the wealth of knowledge spread throughout these forums.</p>
<p>I actually have rather an unusual question, as I have recently recieved a job designing a teachers handbook for teaching a Grade 12 biology unit focused on Epilepsy. This teachers coursebook is to be approximately 100pages in length and we are hoping either the Canadian Ministy of Education or Health will publish it. At this point in time im just comming up with a concept design and would really like it if you could all pick it apart and give me suggestions on both the type and design. Im in a bit of a dilemma as we&rsquo;re not quite sure if it will all be printed in color or only certain pages (depending on funding) so I&rsquo;m trying to find a good design that organizes the info and looks good. Unfortunately with this type of project there isnt so much room for wild creativity as there is so much info to get across, but im hoping a few of you will have some ideas to add more of a spark or something eye catching to the design. I&rsquo;m hoping to make the design look good in both B&amp;W and full color (depending again on the funding). Im using Helvetica Neve as the title and subtitle fonts and Baskerville as the body text (perhaps theres a much better combination and yes i know its not good to mix serifs and sans serifs but I kinda of wanted to give it a try ;-)  If anyone knows some good examples that could help me please pass on a link</p>
<p>Being a first year design student at York University I&rsquo;d love to get some real world input from some of the design guru&rsquo;s on the boards. Heres a pdf version of a mock up design I put together today, please tear it apart and tell me what needs work ;-)</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>
<p>Paul</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I personally would prefer it justified. Your column width is nice, not too big, not too small.</p>
<p>And I find that reading gray text gets boring and annoying after a bit. I am all for highlighting the important parts, but is there a way to get back to reading black on white?</p>
<p>I like the sans/serif combo, works fine for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like, however, the jump from one to two columns. I would prefer one single column. My eye had a tough time following the pattern of text because the chart was there and there was no clear line of thought to continue the text. If that was single column, with the list centered between the paragraphs I would like it better.</p>
<p>Note: I have no idea what I am talking about.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I, too, have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about. Like seriously&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree with samadam&hellip;the sans/serif combo is good, but I&rsquo;m not loving the gray text. If you do end up going for color, why don&rsquo;t you make everything that&rsquo;s bold blue and then make the body copy black. Save gray, if anything, for the &ldquo;did you knows&rdquo;. The way it is now, the stuff on the margins stands out more than the text&hellip;it almost seems like you&rsquo;re encouraging the teachers to skim it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really get the shadow on that top shape. Curves are neat, and maybe the curve interacts with another page in the spread&hellip;even neater. Why don&rsquo;t you just make it flat color so it matches the &ldquo;navigation&rdquo; you have on the right (also it&rsquo;d look better in b&amp;w). If you do keep the shadow, I&rsquo;d move the text up a bit so that it doesn&rsquo;t come so close to it.</p>
<p>By the way, I like the nav thing&hellip;I think it&rsquo;s good for documents like these&hellip;keeps people thinking about the big picture. However, does it have to stand out so much? It&rsquo;s the first thing I look at. Could it be incorporated more subtly somewhere into the top margin?</p>
<p>Justifying the copy and removing that second column would help simplify the layout, but I feel like you can also do something creative with the left alignment. You have a hierarchy started here (the title out to the left, the text in the middle, the definitions of phisiologic/psychologic further in), but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s pushed all the way (the headers are on the same level as the text, the list doesn&rsquo;t conform). Besides, you&rsquo;ve already imposed hierarchy by using bold and sans-serif, so is the whole title outdent thing really necessary? Aligning the title with the text would give you a strong lefthand alignment and would make the indent of the definitions even more powerful. Plus, without that outdent you could probably afford to move the text over a little to the left, giving the right column more room to breathe. But on the other hand, if you want to do the indent/oudent thing, push it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m mentioning this but &ldquo;non-epileptic seizures are classified in two major categories&rdquo; should probably not have an elipsis after it.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you hate it when you have to cram a URL into a tight box like that. Why is learn more boxed but did you know not? I prefer unboxed, makes things a little less cramped and you could use the space to fit URLS. However, it does stand out in the box&hellip;so if you really want them to rush to their computers and type in that URL, go for it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps, at least a little bit. It&rsquo;s more a stream of consciousness (maybe he should do this, maybe he should do that) than an actual constructive critique, but maybe you&rsquo;ll get something out of it. I think that it is a very attractive and clean design as it stands (I wouldn&rsquo;t care if half of the things I mentioned didn&rsquo;t get changed); the fact that it is clean makes it beg to be just a tiny bit cleaner.</p>
<p>Best of luck,
David</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Alright, here I go again; I promise to not KILL this thread. A few remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are not already doing so, you NEED to be working on a typographic grid. From what I saw, you may well already be doing so, but, looking at only one page, I would have no idea. I hope that you are familiar with this concept, and if you are not, then you need to hurry out and purchase a copy of &ldquo;Grid Systems in Graphic Design&rdquo; by Joseph Müller Brockman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I typically prefer justified copy, but again, but this will mean that you are going to have to spend a lot of time with each page individually. Ensuring that you get decent spacing, and well proportioned text is going to be somewhat difficult, as this style is not something that just &ldquo;falls into place&rdquo;. As it stands now, your rag is horrible, and if you do go with a rag right, then you will yet again be forced to deal with balancing this out, so that your rag does not jump all over the place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree that HN is a poor choice. It has great legibility, but, it has become a less attractive choice due to its current overuse by too many designers. I would definitely suggest looking for alternatives, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to use something that you may have not heard of. As long as its legible, then there really isn&rsquo;t a problem with using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your body copy has rather poor contrast at the moment. I am not sure if this is due to the typeface, the color of the text, or a combination of the above. You might also try using a different face here. Depending on what kind of feel you are going for, I have a few favorites for body copy:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Utopia, Olympian, Sabon, Caslon, Bembo, Electra, Weiss, Garamond, Kepler, and the list goes on. Really, I try and make some sort of connection between the typeface I choose, and the subject of the content, but this is not always possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am<a href="http://trackandkern.com/yh/production33.pdf"> uploading</a> a piece I am about to finish, as an example for you. Its a publication that is completely built around a typographic grid, and for this reason I have included all of the guides and, including the baseline grid. This obscures the aesthetic feel, but I felt it more important that you understand the structure of the piece, rather than anything else. Perhaps it may give you some ideas or inspiration. This is a piece that will print on a cream, antique white stock, just in case you think I&rsquo;m crazy for using blue text with orange headlines. It does look rather crisp and contemporary imho.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I recommend avoiding justified text (and where possible hyphenation) for this kind of subject, my reasons are that many of the longer medical terms (the ones likely to need hyphenation) might not be familiar for the reader and will be easier to read in one word blocks and that a justified text, even with hyphenation, containing longer words is likely to produce rivers in the block. Ranged left, ragged right also needs careful attention to avoid widows, orphans and a loose rag but will serve the reader better.
On another note I would run spellcheck over your copy and do a find and replace for double word spaces.
If your learn more boxes are going to contain urls I would look at making them one line, maybe moving the box to the bottom of the page and taking it to the measure.
Unless binding prevents it, the centre gutter seems huge, try mocking up a spread.
The text printed as a tint is probably worth avoiding as well you could, if you feel it necessary, make the headings tinted but the text as it stands is too light.
Hope some of this is helpful.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First, you will not get the Canadian Ministry of Education to fund this, as there isn&rsquo;t one. Education is provincial. (Health is federal, however).</p>
<p>Secondly, you won&rsquo;t get anyone to fund it with the spelling errors that are currently in it. There are two on the first line alone.</p>
<p>For design, you are wise to be considering black and white only, as the majority of teacher guides are one color. But do design in color &hellip; ever now and then the government will splurge on things, for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>I also agree that the three column format is too tight for a 8.5 x 11 page. Keep in mind that this might get published in loose leaf format, with room needed for three ring binder holes. I would go to one major column and the side bar column, which is a bit better than two text columns, imho.</p>
<p>I would keep ragged right. I think the objections to it are due to the narrow columns. I would also look at reducing the amount of space between paragraphs to 1/3 or 1/2 line, rather than a full line space.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all the help, I&rsquo;ve taken all of what you&rsquo;ve said into account and feel that my design looks 10 times better now! Thanks once again! Sorry about the spelling errors as this was just a rough proof and the text is sort of dummy text, typed very quickly to get the feeling across. The document probably has many, many typos ;-) I&rsquo;ll have to remember to proof read before uploading.</p>
<p>@ Don sorry your absolutely right about education being provincial and healthcare federal I just lumped them together under federal which was innacurate. Your also very right about funding and color but we&rsquo;re hoping to get private funding to make up the difference in printing costs.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly I redid some of the design this morning following some of the ideas posted earlier, so I didnt get the messages about perhaps not justifying it. I do though quite like the look now and I feel things are starting to fall into place. As mentioned earlier there is quite a large margin as this will most likely end up in a binder so there needs to be room for hole punches and rings, but I can see that it does look weird alone.</p>
<p>I also changed the font from grey to black with blue subtitles and also decided to switch from Helvetica to Univers and Baskerville. I used the grid systems and I feel it really pulled together the design.</p>
<p>If there are any other suggestions anyone has please dont hesitate to tell me and once again thanks so much for all you time I feel ive learned alot so far. Wish i could post up the changed document but it wont let me post a pdf in a comment (am I missing something?)</p>
