body: Apologies if this has been covered before; I couldn&#39;t seem to get the forum
  search to work. <BR> <BR>In many of my Pro families - Warnock, Jenson, etc - there
  are, in addition to all the various weights, faces for Caption, Subhead, Display,
  and other programmatic descriptions. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the deal with these? How
  do they differ from the Regular face &#40;I see differences in kerning, but I don&#39;t
  know the rhyme or reason to them&#41;, and if they only do differ in terms of spacing,
  what&#39;s the reasoning that makes, say, the &#39;Caption&#39; face more tightly
  spaced than the Display, and so on?

    Typography&#34;. <BR> <BR>One citation from there: &#34;Historically, some of
    the highest quality typefaces have included different designs for different print
    sizes. Several of Adobe&#39;s OpenType fonts include four optical size variations:
    caption, regular, subhead and display. Called &#34;Opticals,&#34; these variations
    have been optimized for use at specific point sizes. Although the exact intended
    sizes vary by family, the general size ranges include: caption &#40;6-8 point&#41;,
    regular &#40;9-13 point&#41;, subhead &#40;14-24 point&#41; and display &#40;25-72
    point&#41;.&#34; <BR> <BR>There has been a more detailed info about the &#34;Pro&#34;
    features some weeks ago, but since the adobe-website was redesigned meanwhile
    I couldn&#39;t find that yet. <BR> <BR>Michael'
