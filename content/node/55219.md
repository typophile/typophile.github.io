  you are a part of. Example: AIGA. I'm thinking about joining one, and want to know
  what you think about the one you are in."

  body: "I belong to AIGA. It's a good resource and usually the local events are interesting
    and fun. It can be a good way to connect with other designers or interesting art/design
    figures. However, if you're more then 20 miles outside the \"city\" where the
    chapter is located, your event attendance will probably drop as not all events
    are worth the trip (I'm not driving an hour and a half for basically a visit to
    a bar/pub!) But in general the membership fees have been worth the membership
    benefits (professional discounts, access to job boards, etc.) One issue AIGA is
    currently facing is how to better include web design and web developers into the
    organization. Also they sometimes focus too much on international design collaborations
    to the seeming expense of local design communities. But they do a good job of
    promoting design as a profession worthy of respect. \r\n\r\nI would also look
    at Meetup.com if you're aiming for something a little more ad-hoc and \"local\"."
