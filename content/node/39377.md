body: "I have noticed that in many installed fonts, there is a HUGE selection of diacritical
  alternates for all sorts of letters that don't appear to be covered by the usual
  codepages. I would like to support at least some of these in my own typeface, but
  it doesn't appear that I can easily create these glyphs the way I can with the diacritics
  recognized by the codepages, wherein you can simply double click the glyph and a
  copy of both the letter and the diacritic is created. This allows changes made to
  either the diacritic or the letter to be automatically updated, and it makes large
  groups of these alterates very easy to create, delete and recreate as necessary.\r\n\r\nFor
  these unrecognized diacritical glyphs, do I have to lose this functionality? I want
  to support a wide range of diacritics, but I might not have the time to create and
  manage them if they can't be handled as easily as the recognized ones."

  body: "Diacritic characters, i.e. letters with diacritic marks, can be entered in
    text using two ways: static and dynamic. \r\n\r\nThe static method is using precomposed
    forms, i.e. each character is represented by one glyph in the font. Most of these
    glyphs are made using components, so they are composite, or precomposed, glyphs.
    But for a repertoire of these precomposed glyphs, , codepages is an antique mechanism
    to look at. Please look at Unicode Ranges (also called Unicode blocks), this is
    a far more up-to-date mechanism to address  the repertoire of encoded precomposed
    diacritics. For example, look at the Latin Extended B block -- you will find a
    number of characters that are not in any codepages but are present in the Unicode
    standard. In the Unicode Ranges mode of FontLab Studio, you can create those glyphs
    by double-clicking, usually. \r\n\r\nLetters with diacritic marks that are not
    encoded in the Unicode standard in their precomposed form can be entered in text
    as a sequence of base letter followed by a combining diacritic mark. Their rendering
    can be performed using two dynamic methods: substitution or positioning. \r\n\r\nThe
    substitution method works in many applications that support OpenType. It typically
    employs the \"ccmp\" OpenType Layout feature, while sometimes it can also be duplicated
    in the \"liga\" feature for backwards compatibility. I have detailed the process
    of their creation in FontLab Studio on the <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/FontLab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=3403\">FontLab
    forum</a>. \r\n\r\nThe other dynamic method is positioning. This is done using
    the \"mark\" and \"mkmk\" OpenType Layout features. You need Microsoft VOLT to
    add those features. There is a VOLT tutorial on the <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/VOLT_Tutorial\">SIL
    site</a>. \r\n\r\nKarsten L\xFCcke's <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otresources.htm\">OpenType
    resources collection</a> is also a good starting point. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam

  body: "Adam, I think you missed the point of Elliot's question. He wants to know
    if there is a way to have automatically precomposed glyphs appear in FontLab when
    he double-clicks on an appropriately named glyph cell.\r\n\r\nThis used to be
    possible via the alias.dat file, yes? What is the mechanism now?"
