    vague...

  body: "You are welcome, Mark. AFAIK Gridnik is only available via the foundrytypes
    site. If you need a similar font (via immediate download at fontshop) you could
    have a look at <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?J3V\">Blender</a> by Nik
    Thoenen. \r\n\r\nA question: Which font did you use at your own website (besides
    DIN)?\r\n\r\nAs the image upload is defect again, I mean the typeface for \xBBYour
    identity is a valuable system \u2026\xAB\r\n\r\nhttp://www.verlanderdesign.com/approach.html\r\n"
