  thesis, so here i am.\r\n\r\nbasically, i think it's impossible to remove the linguistic
  implications from a letterform and see it as a random shape.  granted, there are
  certain criteria you'd have to follow such as not counting dingbats etc.  im talking
  straight up, looking at a letter \"A\" and thinking \"i dont get it.\"  of course,
  this is can be influenced by context, scale, etc. also what happens when you enhance
  the basic form a letter with dimension, time, etc, where youre arent changing the
  basic structure, just adding to it. but i guess what im wondering is if you have
  any initial thoughts or resources you think i should check out.  anything would
  be appreciated.  if youd like some more in depth info on what im working on, you
  can contact me directly if you want or if everyones ok with some lengthy posts i
  can respond on here.\r\n\r\nthanks a lot."

    you need to explain what direction you are taking as Eben suggested. And yes,
    you can remove liguistic implications (by this do you actually mean phonetic associations?)
    from letterforms, but it takes training both eye and mind.\r\n\r\nBTW -- your
    \"fixing up BRB\" on your web site is refreshing.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'll be right back!"

    so when you look at a letter A, you will only see it as a letter A, whether it's
    being used in text or as a design elements.  you'll still understand that what
    you're looking at is a letterform.  the only kink in that is adding dimension,
    texture, etc. to the shape.  like for example, looking at a 3-dimensional A from
    the top.\r\n\r\nalso, i guess i should add the relevance ie. why i'm even asking.\r\n\r\nour
    capacity to read letterforms has flourished through the inundation of messages
    we receive and the proliferation of typefaces that challenge traditional letterform
    shapes.  im not saying they all look good or anything, but our understanding of
    these shapes has been enriched.  even with things like \"wheel of fortune\" we
    seek out letterforms.  seeing a bunch of sticks on the ground and thinking \"that
    looks like a K.\"  we're just raised to search for messages.\r\n\r\nthis all leads
    to a broader range within which we can deliver meaning and distress type and still
    create clear messages.\r\n\r\nat what point do these letterforms cease to retain
    their linguistic value?  i believe this only occurs when elements are added to
    the basic shape of what defines letterforms. "

  body: "> i believe this only occurs when elements are added to the basic shape of

    have written & see if I get you here. You are saying that - there is a degree
    to which all 'a's are 'a's and that may be more or less (& maybe more or less
    depending on the reader?) You are also saying that in general we are expanding
    our willingness to see an 'a' over time due to exposure to increasingly less 'a'-like
    'a' shapes. You are also saying that there is a point at which the 'a' stops being
    recognized as such. It ceases to be a recognized as a letter.\r\n\r\n> i believe
    this only occurs when elements are added to the basic shape of what defines letterforms.\r\n\r\nYou
    are saying this happens when too many features of 'a' ness are lost. This might
    be degenration, fading, etc - or it might be an extreme design which has failed.\r\n\r\nThis
    is your example of 'looking at a letter \u201CA\u201D and thinking \u201Ci dont
    get it.\u201D '. As in 'I don't see a letter there'.\r\n\r\nIf this is what you
    are talking about it is a sort opposite end of what has been a topic around here
    recently - readability. You are talking about the moment when type becomes unreadable."

    body: "eben - \r\n\r\nyes, the degree of A-ness changes, but stays within the
      \"threshold of semiosis\" which i'm citing from an article in zed issue 4.  on
      one end there is no doubt at what is presented and the other shows extreme doubt.
      \ our abilities to read letterforms that may lean toward the extreme end are
      improving with the way we presented messages, or even in some cases our need
      to seek out messages where they appear to be leacking.\r\n\r\ni'm working on
      being more articulate with my thoughts (thankfully i have an editor and topic
      consultant to help with much of that) but youve got it.  any references or other
      thoughts would great.  i've been reading alot on semiotics and other theory-related
      texts, and also looking for designers whose typefaces fit within the realm of
      this thesis.  ji lee and his \"univers revolved\" and faces by fere-jones are
      getting alot of talk in my paper.  even some of the work over at typeworkshops.com
      is worth mentioning, anton beeke, dainippon, some of the stuff fuse did, are
      all references on current examples running along that threshold.\r\n\r\noh and
      also, i'm basing the notion of what makes a letterform on frutiger's \"skeleton\"
      of a letter, but expanding it to reference the white space around a letter as
      also defining it's shape.  so i'm calling it a \"soul.\"\r\n\r\nadditionally,
      a letter is defined semiotically not just by its shape or the spoken letter
      it represents, but the other letters it is NOT.  so an A is an A because it
      is not a B or a Z etc.  even further, the A may not exist if there is no B or
      Z etc.  the latter notion is really taken into consideration when looking at
      typefaces that are pretty hard to discern, but when you see them in context,
      the forms make more sense."

    of my <a href=\"http://www.typetalkfonts.com\" target=\"_blank\">thesis project</a>,
    yet they are very much connected...\r\n\r\nAre you focusing only on perceptions
    of the Latin alphabet (i suppose anything more would be a huge undertaking) ?
    Are you also looking at perceptions of the symbols/ characters of unfamiliar languages?
    \ There are some type designers who will not design type for a language they do
    not read/write. Perhaps this is because of that relationship which you are exploring,
    connecting even further the relationship between the form/content of type and
    written language...\r\n\r\nI think you'll enjoy David Sacks' \"Language Visible:
    Unraveling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z\". it's not very academic,
    but it gives an interesting historical perspective on the alphabet.\r\n\r\nI'd

    this topic came about from a discussion with a faculty member here at SCAD.  i
    dont recall the whole conversation, but at one point we argued over seeing a letterform
    as a shape and not as a letter.  i'm not arguing against type being used as design
    elements, but even then, a reader will see it as a letterform being used as a
    design element.  i just dont see it as possible to look at a letterform and not
    recognize it as such.  yes, i plan to only deal with the latin alphabet, as much
    of this defined culturally.  i wouldnt recognize japanese characters if i saw
    them.  i may recognize it as some form of language, but i could be fooled pretty
    easily on that.\r\n\r\ni realize this has been discussed in varying degrees, but
    discussing type semiotically is so interesting to me.  but its also the hard part
    since so much has been said already.  please let me know if you have suggestions
    in thinking i should take the thesis in another direction, based on that conversation
    i had.\r\n\r\ni would love to keep you all up to date on the progress including

      defining the shape of letterforms.  but youre not really keeping the letterform
      intact by scaling so large as to hide portions.  did that make sense?  the whole
      point is to keep the letterform intact.  now if youre saying the letter is painted
      on a wall or something that could be something different all together.  i guess
