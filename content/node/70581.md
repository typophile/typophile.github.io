  or other fonts like Gotham Black or that? I need something that will work well at
  smaller font sizes and has a clean, modern--if not retro-modern look...\r\n\r\nIs
  this too vague?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\na"

  body: "Are you looking for headings, body, etc? Serif? Sans?\r\n\r\nI like the way
    Trajan works with Futura, since the skeletons of the letters are similar but it
    doesn't have a lower case, and I wouldn't really call it retro-modern.\r\n\r\nBodoni,
    Didot, or Walbaum also contrast nicely with Futura due to their, well, contrast.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps!\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. I changed my icon after 6 years, but it's
    still me."

  body: I guess I'm looking for something like the text in the image below - or something
    similar. I'm familiar with Bodoni and Didot and I'm thinking of something sans
    serif, tall and narrow. Clean and easy to read...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TDWN_Detail2_4516.jpg]
