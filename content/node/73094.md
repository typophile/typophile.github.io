  body: "I fear that Frode may be right. Nearest I came was DIN Display Pro by Parachute
    (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-display-pro/), which is more brutal
    than this and has many character differences, some more subtle than others, and
    T26's Coupe, again with many differences, not least the two-storey g.\r\n\r\nIf
    it turns out to be commercially available, perhaps those will point someone in
    a better direction.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    e and s suggest to me that it might not be a commercial font. I couldn\u2019t
    find it at dafont\u2019s sans serif section either."
