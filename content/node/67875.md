  have tried Identifont, WhatTheFont, etc. to no avail. I think I pulled this screenshot
  from graphic-exchange.com, and the design firm is MadeThought. I can't find the
  original when I go back to those sites.\r\n\r\nI've been looking through didones
  and bodonis, but can't find anything that feels quite right. Thanks sincerely for
  the help!"
