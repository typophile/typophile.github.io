  Hey, if you buy a font online, do you get it straight away? And can you only use
  it on one computer, or could you email it to yourself and use it on your new computer
  that you haven't got yet, when you get it?\r\n\r\nso i briefly explained about EULA's,
  but in looking for some info about them in the wiki i couldn't see anything. is
  there already info in there, or can some of you please answer the above questions?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: This is pretty open-ended. Sadly the answer to most of these questions is
    that it depends upon the EULA. Which foundry is your friend curious about?

    sent her a link to their license.

    to read it wouldn''t be very useful. ;) Village has a very user-friendly license. '

  body: Unless the computer bought it, it belongs to the person, who should be able
    to use it on the computer they own at the time. But yea, check the EULA if you
    care.

  body: 'Perhaps Chester will chime in, but from reading the <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Ogilve/Licensing/">license</a>
    which accompanies Ogilve, if you buy a single license, you may use it on 4 computers. '

    are and why they are important. '

    When you purchase something with an EULA, you are agreeing to it. It''s a legal
    document. '

    we have going then maybe you'll have something more solid to share. ;)
