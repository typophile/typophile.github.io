    not in the business of hunting down free look-alikes maybe someone else can help
    him there.

  body: A word from both moderators <BR> <BR>In keeping with Typophile&#39;s mission
    to further and protect  <BR>type design, we strongly discourage references to
    free-  <BR>or shareware rip-offs of available digital typefaces. <BR> <BR>Recognizing
    that there are gray areas in regards to what  <BR>constitutes a rip-off, this
    policy doesn&#39;t apply to fonts  <BR>which are interpretations of existing typefaces
    which are  <BR>not yet made digital by their copyright holders, and maybe  <BR>other
    special cases. The matter will be open to discussion  <BR>at its dedicated thread
    in the &#40;very&#41; near future.

  body: I don&#39;t know if anybody saw it but the New York Times ran an article on
    new typefaces a few weeks back in Arts &amp; Leisure. They highlighted &#40;of
    course&#41; Emigre, House, Hoefler, etc. but it was still nice to see some recognition
    of the &#34;new classics&#34;. They also confirmed what&#39;s been the subject
    of much debate here, which is that it&#39;s rare to find a free font with the
    character quality, full character set, kerning pairs, etc. that make a font beautiful
    and truly usable. <BR> <BR>Not that all licensed fonts are great either...

  body: ITC Machine is overpriced at $39.95 for a single weight. That&#39;s their
    privilege, of course.

  body: There are actually 2 weights at $21 each, according to MyFonts. <BR> <BR>And
    whether something is overpriced depends on how badly you need it ;-&#41;

  body: Overpriced at $39.95 for a single weight? Not sure about that. <BR> <BR>Take
    a look at lineto.com. Some great type, but each face is at least $100 USD. Ugh.
    That&#39;s definitely overpriced in my book.
