  online 3D interactive courseware. They want to show the 3D aspect of what we do.
  I have come up with some ideas but i am not sure if anyting is working at all, opinions
  and advise would be great.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/versions1_5596.jpg]"

    idea of a grayscale P is kinda interesting, but it doesn't make me think 3D.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Since when did \"cute\" become a standard of logo success? \r\n\r\nThe only
    versions that suggest 3D are #4 and #8.  Being that #4 just shows a box, I don't
    think that's really going anywhere.  Version 8 is a little hard to see, and it
    kinda looks like you've used the ol' 3D button filter on it.  I like the \"pixel
    in the yard\" idea, but the execution could use some work."

  body: "Seems to me like you have a lot of good sugestions. \r\nIt might be hard
    to execute, but maybe the 3-dimensional boxes in #4 and #8 would conote pixels
    better if there were more of them, like in examples #1,#2 and #3. It's hard to
    identify a square as a pixel when you see only one."

  body: "I like 8 on the design, but the illustration has me thinking box in yard,
    not necessarily pixel. Pixels are flat 2D. As far as the pixels building up the
    logo, it's not a bad direction, but it seems like something that has been used
    pretty often. think Xerox, or something similar. We had a motion graphics studio
    near my college back in the day, and their logo was a similar execution. \r\n\r\nAnd,
    the blue would be better suited emphasizing \"Pixel\" rather than \"Yard,\" (like
    v.4) since pixel is more relative to what you all actually do.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Do you only do 3d work? If not then i would actually say that you should
    think about your more extensive branding and marketing to carry that point across
    and keep your logo clean and simple. Also don't focus too heavily on the tool
    - focus on the idea. In the same way you don't need to show a wrench for a plumber
    you don't need to overemphasize 3D which is a tool to creating immersive and intuitive
    learning experiences. Go for the result. Leave your methodology to your materials.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that I like 1,2,6 and 8"

    a 2d projected 3d logo.. that would let you keep pixels, have it 3d, have it say
    video possibly.\r\n\r\ni know this looks crappy, but maybe itll give you an idea[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pyard_6677.jpg]"
