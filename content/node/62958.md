body: First of all, I apologize in advance if I put this in the wrong forum. I am
  searching for a font in the same style as the font Papyrus, that is not distressed.
  Can anyone give me words of wise guidance on where something like this might live?
  Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Papyrus_4494.gif]

    at TypOasis may be undistressed, and Scriptorium has a Papyrus-like font called
    Ereshkigal (may be distressed) and 3 Islands Press has Fidelma, a similar, undistressed
    style.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    a somewhat modified take on Papyrus (the A is different at least), complete with
    similar erosions to look like it was written on its original's namesake writing
    material.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
