  in (cursor flashes) but won't accept any keystrokes? i'd like to do some searching,
  but can't!!\r\n\r\ni'm on a G4 mac tower, running 10.4.7, using safari 2.0.4 and

    The Typohile search is still buggy, and wont work half the time, so, if you want
    to search through Typophile, use the above link and exchange 'Whateveryousearchfor'
    with the actual 'Keywords' you want to search for. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"
