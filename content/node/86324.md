  and inserts of his Merz journal? I'm interested not only in the font he used for
  the title (which has been a previous topic on this forum in 2008, though unsolved)
  but also the fonts used for the 5 and the 7 (below) and the ARP MAPPE subheading.\r\n\r\nI
  am fairly certain he printed from wood type. And I know that he, and that he printed
  this Merz portfolio at the A. Molling print shop in Hannover, also affiliated with
  the typesetter Paul Vogt in these years (of PEUVAG Druckerei).  \r\n\r\nEven if
  the fonts can't be identified exactly -- any insight into what typefaces Molling's
  shop might have had on hand? And where were they likely cut? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is a really interesting question, which I hadn't thought about up to
    now. Later Schwitters used Paul Renner's Futura, but the Arpaden date from 1923,
    I think, so far too early for that. You could try mailing the Schwitters archive
    at the Sprengel Museum in Hannover (Dr Isabel Schulz is the contact) and asking
    there. Please keep me updated on this and I'll seee if I can't do a bit of research
    myself. \r\nRegards,\r\nGwendolen Webster\r\n"

  body: "Thanks to you both. I agree that it's a font in the Block Berthold family
    too. \r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm my questions about the type itself - whether or
    not these titles and subheadings would have been printed from wood (and not metal)
    type? And if so, does anyone know if those type bodies would have been end-cut,
    die-cut, or manufactured by some other method? "

  body: "Is it any help at all that Molling used flatbed printing? Probably not. \r\nBy
    the way, there is a Merz picture entitled Merz Mosaic of Quartered Ornaments (now
    at the Sprengel), dating from 1924, a grid-based composition made up of letterpress
    blanks. Isabel Schulz suggest KS made this while working on Merz 7, and a variation
    of the picture is to be found in Merz 7 itself:   \r\nhttp://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/merz/7/pages/70.htm\r\n-
    it's difficult to imagine the blanks came from anywhere else than Molling.\r\nIt
    has also been suggested that Schwitters used lithographic stones from Molling
    to produce the Merz Mappe, or Merz Portfolio, of 1923. Sorry this doesn't answer
    your question, but its easy to get diverted with Schwitters...  \r\n"

    body: Yes, I do know this fantastic work. It is somewhat possible it was made
      at Vogt, though, since that is where they typset Die Scheuche. But Molling is
      very likely too given the date. Edel Sheridan-Quantz has done a great deal more
      research on Molling in the mean time. Do you know her work? She published an
      article in the KSUK newsletter about Schwitters and Molling.

    and to this thread, after a few years away from it and appreciate the responses.
    \ \r\n\r\nA follow-up question: to those with an eye for these things who have
    suggested Block Berthold Regular -- do you think the Molling book Kling Klang
    (specifically the headings \"4 T\xD6NENDE BILDERB\xDCCHER\" and \"KLING KLANG\")
    is the same font? \r\n\r\nhttp://blog.paperboxx.com/archives/2374\r\n"

    Don't expect much more answers on this thread, because it belongs to the old,
    abandoned type-id section.\r\nIt's better to post a fresh question on the new
