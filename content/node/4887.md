body: So I&#39;ve got about $500 to start a font collection with. I can&#39;t make
  up my mind between linotype essentials one or two. The main thing that leans me
  to essentials one is helvetica. Call me soulless but I really love that family.
  Anyone have thoughts on which set would be better?  <BR> <BR>are there any font
  collections that are similar?

  body: I know, I know...and browsing these forums I&#39;ve found some great ones,
    but I have to start someplace and this way I get typefaces for about $3 a piece
    as opposed to $30.

  body: Get Bitstream&#39;s Type Odyessy instead. <BR> <BR>Their &#34;Swiss&#34; is
    a very good Helvetica, and you get a lot more stuff than on the Linotype CDs &#40;and
    in a larger range of weights&#41;, plus a nice range of more recent stuff. <BR>
    <BR>Off the top of my head, versions of Futura and Franklin Gothic aren&#39;t
    included with Bitstream. If you need these, you may like to consider Linotype.
    I got both sets &#40;LT and bitstream&#41;.

    the CD-ROM at the beginning of my career for <BR>all those plain-vanilla faces
    I might need because clients  <BR>specifically request them, and I haven&#39;t
    regretted the  <BR>purchase ever since.

  body: If you&#39;re a student, you should consider our &#40;Adobe&#39;s&#41; Type
    Classics for Learning. With 400 fonts for $99, including many Adobe Originals,
    it&#39;s a great deal, and still leaves you money to pick up other stuff. <BR>

  body: Hehe, Thomas to the rescue. I really should give that collection  <BR>a look,
    though I can&#39;t take advantage of it anymore. Link?

  body: Yves <BR> <BR>I&#39;d agree with you but I really don&#39;t know what &#34;really
    stand out&#34; entails for you. Stand out to whom?  <BR> <BR>Personally, and I
    know this goes against the grain of current practice, but I&#39;d rather have
    less rather than more fonts, or at least, a trusted few well thought out, technically
    proficient fonts, whose look I also happen to like, and whose text setting capability
    saves me a lot of time and money &#40;by forgoing adjustments to letterform combinations,
    etc.&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So my recommendation would not be to go the CD route, as
    you also suggest, but for perhaps different reasons. In writing about the selection
    of metal types, Lewis Allen, in his book Printing with the Handpress, suggested
    selection after careful study, as &#34;inferior tools corrode the spirit.&#34;
    Always kind of favored that remark.
