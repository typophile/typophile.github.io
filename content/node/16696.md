    the typography of the site.\r\n\r\nFor starters, fake small caps???"

  body: Heh, I noticed that, too. Unfortunately, real small caps are impossible in
    web typography (so far). I would have used a slightly larger size. On my browser
    (Safari), his small caps are smaller than the lowercase x-height. Feh.

  body: "There are at least a couple orphans lying around -adding a non breaking space
    usually will sort that out online, but is this really a fair use of the book?
    \r\n\r\nDoes simply adding 'applied to the web' really allow you to lift a whole
    book and republish the structure and contents online? It seems to push boundaries
    of inspiration...\r\n\r\nWhat else can we expect next? Ways of Seeing - Online?\r\n"

  body: ">It seems to push boundaries of inspiration\u2026\r\n\r\nGood point.\r\nI
    suspect that legally (for written work, if not for visual) it depends on the ratio
    of quoted material to new material. And here there seems to be a lot more commenting
    than swiping. However, it does seem to trade heavily on the status of the original.
    But if it is not a commercial work? I wonder what academic commentaries (on non-public
    domain work) do?"

  body: "Yeesh, no small task, and quite likely an impossible situation. Huge potential
    to end up looking bad unless the person setting the site up has iron-clad CSS
    experience. For example, here are screenshots of the TOC in FF1.5 and IE6 (both
    PC). First off, why Flash for the graphic text at top left? Something wrong with
    a good old GIF or JPG? Then there's the serious mess up in formatting the TOC
    entries in IE. Yikes. Perhaps the site is still in very early beta, but, well,
    hmm...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ets4web.gif]"

  body: "I thought the piece on justification and hyphenation might have mentioned
    the shy as an option. Its odd that despite saying outright 'don\u2019t justify
    text on the web', his own clearleft site does just that...\r\n\r\n>But if it is
    not a commercial work?\r\n\r\nWith prior knowledge of clearleft, i was already
    imagining this republished as book, ala DOM Scripting, with the complimentary
    conference ala d.Construct, as per recent form.\r\n\r\nIt is odd that typography
    is not even listed as an interest in his bio... Talent borrow, genius steals?"

  body: Thanks for that Lauren, good to learn of new things in this area. That said,
    it still seems like overkill to me; graphics on that site are page headings, not
    on-the-fly content, and as page headings they could use a bit more attention than
    trusting any text-to-graphic translator to account for tracking/kerning/etc.

  body: "I guess em2 solutions, the vendor of GlyphGate, is better at software development
    than it is at marketing. It's a beautiful technology. It comes with an optional
    browser plugin. When the user installs it, he can get arbitrary designed-specified
    fonts (as \"embedded fonts\") on any browser: Opera, Firefox, Safari, IE. Without
    the plugin, IE/Win users get embedded fonts while users of other browsers get
    either plain text set in a standard fonts or text rendered into bitmaps -- all
    depending on how the designer sets up his own GlyphGate configuration. \r\n\r\nIt
    even supports hyphenation on the web if the browser principally supports it. E.g.
    you can set it up the way that IE/Win users get hyphenated full-justified text
    while users of other browsers get left-aligned unhyphenated text. \r\n\r\nIt's
    just so much better than anything that the script kiddies with their funny Flash
    applets have ever come up. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n "
