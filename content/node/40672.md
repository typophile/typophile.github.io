    I think.

    this, but his site seems to require a password at the moment(?), so I can't check.\r\n\r\nOr
    did he do something superficially similar (duo/mono-line) that was actually nothing
    like this, for somebody else?"

  body: Wow, that link said the release by Grafik Magazine was in November 2005. I
    cannot believe how time flies. I've gotta get some fonts finished before it's
    too late.

    It's lowercase only.

    Not sure if I'm missing a page or what but I couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nD."

  body: It may not be that Grafik but it's certainly in a Grafik because I remember
    reading it with my own eyes. Unfortunately I don't have the Grafik in question
    either. Someone out there must subscribe to Grafik and be able to lay their paws
    on it. It was towards the end of the magazine - the nice bit where they look at
    a font classic.
