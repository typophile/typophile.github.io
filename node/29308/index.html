<div class=commentbody>Just my view but:
_ isn't “Helvetica light overly tighly kerned” dated ang generic?
Maybe a bit more research in fonts would lead to something more surprising.
On page 6 you use a set of ornaments to separate the sections Publisher / Other titles... I'm just not sure that this oldish stuff expresses anything in relation to the contemporary music (modern minimalism) that Glass creates.</div>

<div class=commentbody>cover: classical arangement. nice.. the negativ (white) text-line would nice with a little more space between the characters?
the scrathes in the background are??
The Initial on page 3 not in helvetciaa light??
the ornaments are nice.. perhaps it can be used for seperates more content stuff on the text-sites (3-5)?
there are (at all) a mixed of two fonts. would it be a kindly cover with the light helvetica over all??</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think in genereal you need to pay a lot more attention to your body copy. If you are choosing to justify the text then you need to pay speacial attention to where you hyphanate words.
In the introduction 'collaboration' and 'process' are hyphanated quite badly. When hyphanating words try to use the syllables within the word. 'collabor-ation' and 'pro-cess'.
Something else when justifying text is making sure that the tracking between each word is consistent. If you look at the third paragraph in the introduction, and compare the first sentence' tracking, compared to the last sentence' tracking, ending in 'Laurie' you will see that the word spacing is much tighter in the first and looser in the last. TO remedy this you need to play with taking words over, and taking words back from each line, and this is where the use of hyphans becomes important as they help to create an evenly coloured page.
Due to the short line length you may find yourself adding many hyphans, here I suggest, that due to it being the introduction, there may be an opportunity to replace certain words with others that are of the same meaning but different lengths.
I have just set a 200 page book and that was justified, it took at least a full few weeks to go through it and tweak every line.
Justifyling lines requires a lot of patience, as does all typesetting, but it is worth it in the end, gives you something to be proud about.
Good luck
Matt</div>
