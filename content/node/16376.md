  the double space after a period is a helpful marker to a reader of the tightly leaded
  text (look at the attachment to see the whole page). Modern book designers would
  never use 2 spaces after a period, but in a set of books that even densely set expands
  to 30 volumes, I can see why they would want to economize."

  body: Fortunately we now have the benefit of much more economical type, so we can
    avoid such tight leading. That typeface there is pretty wide.
