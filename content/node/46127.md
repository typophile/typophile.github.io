    will regret it. In other words, it's OK for OS 9 but never for OS 10.\r\n\r\nGet
    Disk Warrior instead; it's OK for OS 10."

    had thrown away their 8.0 since they had long since transitioned to 10.\r\n\r\nI
    figured some pack rat still had it. That's why I was asking for it. I need it
    specifically for the 9.2 laptop.\r\n\r\nThanks though\r\nMichael"

  body: "Michael --\r\n\r\nI still have a pristine disk of Norton Utilities 4.0 (ca.
    1998). Don't ask me why. I don't know if this would do any good with OS 9.2. If
    you can't find a more current version and get desperate enough to want to try
    this, let me know.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    I had to buy NU8. Thank you so much though.\r\n\r\nMichael"
