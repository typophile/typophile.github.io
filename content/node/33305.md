  body: "I love the edit comment feature! I wish it was on all forums I use.\r\n\r\nFor
    the record everyone... I used <strong>Alluding not Eluding</strong> originally.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I do wish was included in the HTML, is Strikeout, so when I do edit, I can just
    strikeout the original and add the updated."
