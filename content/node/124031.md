  itguyjosh.com - but I forgot to note down the font that I used in creating it. I
  would like to use the font in more logos/banners, but I have no idea what it could
  be. I've tried WTF, but none of the suggestions look right to me. I've attached
  the favicon as a png and appreciate any advice.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJosh"
