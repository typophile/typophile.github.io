  for weight. Now I realize how dependant I have become to choose different weights
  depending on compositions and not having choices is really annoying. Does anyone
  know if they are planning on releasing different weights ever?\r\n\r\nOr if the
  fonts were going to be used for a logo, how hard do you think it would be to give
  them more weight by hand?"

  body: 'It''s easy to get swept away by a typeface and forget what tools you need
    to get the job done. Our wiki should include a collective checklist for choosing
    type. It would include: make sure the family has sufficient weights, widths, small
    caps, and/or italics for your purposes.'

  body: "If you're using the fonts for a logo you can try stroking them in illustrator
    but that approach tends to work better with sans than serif fonts. \r\n\r\nHouse
    seems to let you modify their fonts (nice of them!) but no embedding! "
