body: Hey all.  Its me again Mr. Newb Layout. <BR> <BR>I work for a small town newspaper
  and my bosses and editor want to change our printing press to one closer in town.   The
  problem is now we have to resize or paper. <BR> <BR>So instead of running 11 inches
  tall and 14 inches high.  We are not supposedly running 10 inches high and 11.5
  inches wide.  This is per page mind you. Also its a 4 column paper. <BR> <BR>I have
  been asked to find out how much smaller our ads are going to be and come up with
  the new dimensions.  I thought this was going to be easy but now I am finding that
  its not, well at least not me. <BR> <BR>I will create an action to re-size all the
  ad sizes once I find out all the new dimensions for our ads.  <BR> <BR>But does
  anyone have any suggestions on how to do this quickly?  It probably obvisous but
  just not seeing it. <BR> <BR>Thanks all for reading and making me look good <IMG

  body: If I understand you properly, these pages are not proportionate, so a full
    page ad would reduce approximately 91% horizontally and 82% vertically, obviously
    not an ideal situation. However, you don&#39;t mention the grid which is more
    critical than actual paper size, if you adjust margins and gutters you might be
    able to make a proportionate reduction. <BR>Tim

  body: The question is how you bill out your advertising.  Per column inch or is
    it modular? <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s modular, I&#39;d just figure out the new sizes
    by doing the whole &#34;1/2 page is this on the old stuff, now it&#39;s this.&#34;
    by just figuring out what a half page is. <BR> <BR>OR, if your paper wants to
    keep the same number of column inches is per ad, then I guess it means redesigning
    all the ad sizes and just phasing out the old stuff. <BR> <BR>Example... <BR>The
    newspaper I ran we had our first issue as a tabloid, but every subsequent issue
    was a broadsheet &#40;50 inch web I believe&#41;.  I kept everything as &#34;3
    col x 10 in&#34; or so, that way, when the ads that transferred to the next issue,
    all I had to do was go by my columns by inches. <BR> <BR>Maybe that helps, it
    might just sound confusing... It is 9 am for me, and I don&#39;t think the brain
    is functioning yet.

  body: I don&#39;t think you can do any sort of formulaic resizing when the aspect
    ratio also changes. It sounds like you&#39;ll be creating a new grid layout for
    the new page size, right? As such, the ad sizes will change in relation to that.

  body: Hey all I am feeling better now.  I am spending this day try to figure out
    the re-sizing issue. <BR> <BR>Tim, you said mess with the grid and gutters and
    maybe I can figure out a porportionate reduction in all my ad sizes?  How would
    chaning the grid really effect anything?

  body: Hey I think I did it.  I kept it 4 columns and made the gutter .125 brought
    in the left and right margins a few smidges and now the ad sizes proportionally
    scale down to the their correct size &#40;i.e. a quarter page is now a &#34;quarter
    page&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>I think.  Now I only got to figure out an easy way of
    figuring out the new add dimenions sizes somehow.

  body: Bah I spoke to soon.  Quarter pages fit fine by now 1/2 columns dont.  WTF?  Should
    I tell my superiors its not worth my time?  I guess I could go back and re-design
    every ad but I dont think they really want me to do that. <BR> <BR>This blows.

  body: Luis, <BR>Try reducing your original grid by 87% &#40;split between the two
    percentage reductions of the page size&#41;. This will change your margins and
    gutters in both directions. See how this affects the look of the page the side
    margins will be larger and the footer and header will be smaller &#40;proportionately&#41;.
