body: As most of you are likely aware, the tools and  <BR>technology surrounding type
  design have changed at <BR>an impressive clip in the last few years. The days of
  <BR>Fontographer and Quark 4 are long gone. As a result, <BR>the types we license
  have changed as well. OpenType <BR>fonts with rich features are becoming common,
  though <BR>they&#39;re still far from mainstream. With this change we&#39;ve <BR>become
  friendly with new programs &#40;FontLab &amp; InDesign&#41;  <BR>but only slightly
  familiar with how to speak of these new fonts. <BR> <BR>Is a single file with Small
  Caps, CE accents, Cyrillic, Greek and  <BR>6 styles of numerals really a single
  font? 4 years ago that might  <BR>have been 12 fonts. How about &#34;Pro&#34; or
  &#34;Basic&#34;? Do we need  <BR>language we can all agree on before we slide into
  the confusions <BR>of SC, LF, OSF, Expert etc? <BR> <BR>Just my thoughts on this

    <BR>I think the model is that individual fooundries or designers are likely to
    specify minimum glyph sets that users can expect, and may market these under particular
    names. There will typically be two considerations: character or language support,
    and feature or typographic support. The interaction of these considerations may
    produce modular nomeclature. For example, a character set might be defined that
    supports particular languages, and some fonts supporting this set might also support
    a set of typographic features, while other fonts with the same language support
    may not have any typographic features, or a different set of features. This suggests
    to me that a clear, if potentially complicated naming system would include one
    part identifying the language support and another the typographic feature set,
    and these two parts could be mixed and matched to identify the combined language
    and feature support of a given font.'

  body: And... after reading through my post I realize why <BR>I don&#39;t post often.
    What an idiot! <BR> <BR>You&#39;re probably right John. It seems the &#34;potentially
    complicated&#34; <BR>solution you&#39;re referring to may become somewhat of a
    norm. <BR>I think it&#39;s still foggy though. <BR> <BR>I suppose what I was trying
    to say with the original post is <BR>that &#40;unfortunately&#41; many people
    view OT with a mix of skepticism <BR>and conspiracy theory. Fortunately we&#39;re
    at such an early stage <BR> that it&#39;s possible to reverse this. Addressing
    the often confusing <BR>language surrounding it could clear a few things up and
    help <BR>type buyers make informed choices.

  body: Hmmm. I agree that many folks are skeptical. As long as they&#39;re still
    on QuarkXPress and Quark doesn&#39;t support the extra goodies or Unicode, they&#39;re
    not seeing a whole ton of benefits. Cross-platform fonts are all very well, but
    only compelling for a few customers. <BR> <BR>For those folks, I agree that they
    have no reason to replace any fonts they already have. However, that is different
    from whether or not they should buy new fonts in OpenType. <BR> <BR>With regards
    to conspiracy theorists do you mean people who think it&#39;s just a scheme to
    get them to spend more money to replace their existing fonts? There are a few
    people who have more elaborate conspiracy theories, but they seem like a pretty
    lunatic fringe. <BR> <BR>Sadly, if terms like SC, LF and Expert were confusing
    to certain people before, then most likely they&#39;ll still be confused. But
    at least they&#39;ll have everything in one font, so they just get what&#39;s
    available, and there are fewer decisions for them to make. No more having a customer
    buy an expert font and then complain that it doesn&#39;t have lower case, at least.
    <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: With PostScript flavored OpenType fonts, for most non-Adobe apps that are
    not specifically OpenType aware, the Win/Mac OS &#40;or ATM for older OSes&#41;
    presents to them the boiled-down class kerning. Basically, it&#39;s the class
    kerning expanded into pairs, and then reduced to just those pairs that for which
    both characters are in MacRoman/WinANSI. <BR> <BR>However, such apps get no kerning
    at all for these fonts with pairs where either member is outside the basic WinANSI/MacRoman
    range. <BR> <BR>With regards to TrueType flavored OpenType, they can contain both
    kern table pairs and GPOS kern feature class kerning. However, AFAIK today non-Adobe
    apps only see the pairs and not the class kerning. <BR> <BR>Finally, AFAIK Apple
    does not yet support any kerning of any sort in Cocoa for either PostScript Type
    1 or PostScript flavored OpenType fonts. So the above only applies to Carbon applications.  <IMG

  body: Thomas, yes the conspiracy theories in question are related <BR>to those that
    feal Adobe is peddling OT as another money <BR>making scheme. Hilarious really,
    because I&#39;m guessing the <BR>type department isn&#39;t a major player when
    it comes to profits <BR>for Adobe &#40;compared to say Photoshop&#41;.

  body: You&#39;re right. <BR> <BR>Sure, Adobe would love to make more money off of
    fonts, which are a tiny fraction of Adobe&#39;s business. But the strategy for
    doing that is to offer better technology so that people will want to use the new
    stuff. Users will only make the move if they see value in OpenType, and we&#39;re
    trying to give them that value. Mostly, we expect average users to buy their new
    fonts in OpenType format, not to replace their existing fonts any time soon. <BR>
