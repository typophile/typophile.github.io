body: I tried for last four hours to find out what font it is. Tried different websites,
  uploading the image, reaching nowhere in the end. Sometimes I feel like it's a bit
  photoshopped but again the width of letters suggests it's a typefont. I'm not an
  expert on these matter so please excuse my explanation. Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6683.jpg]
