  my face here too. <BR> <BR>Its hypothetical intention is to determine the truth
  or false nature of spoken word through vocal recognition software. It will be used
  as an option of captioning on a television and other digital applications, mainly
  cell phones. <BR> <BR>The alternate face is used to show vocal pattern inconsistencies
  during display. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33835.jpg"

  body: Well I blew them up so you could see them a little better.  It is optimized
    for 20pt. That is the smallest text on the page, which is the optimal size.  Any
    other bluriness could just be exporting it to jpeg.   <BR> <BR>it works the best
    at 100% at 20, 40, 60pt etc, though its not meant to be seen at those sizes.
