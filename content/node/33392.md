  a user here in Typohile (don\u2019t  remember who\u2026.)\r\n But I don\u2019t think
  it is perfect, but I can\u2019t figure out what to change\u2026\r\nHope anyone got
  a good idea\r\n\r\nMarty\r\n"

  body: "I don't think Arial should ever be used in a logo. Even Helvetica would work
    better than Arial.\r\n\r\nI like Jon's suggestion of Kontrapunkt, but I like your
    original tree rings better than his - they're more subtle with just the edge of
    bark around them.\r\n\r\nSo, my advice: Keep the rings, but change the font.\r\n\r\n

    \r\nI dont know anything about design, but I just thought it could be cool to
    design my own logo for my company...\r\n\r\ncheers all of you\r\n\r\nMarty"

  body: "Along those lines, <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000210#specimen\"
    target=\"_blank\">Fakir</a> might be nice too. It's a shame there isn't a weight
    between regular and black though.\r\n\r\nMartin - another hint for designing this
    logo: take a look at how Jon set the text. \"S\xD8LUND\" is not quite as wide
    as \"T\xD8MRERFIRMAET\" because of the way the space under the 'T' looks. You'll
    probably need to do that regardless of what font you use.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S.
    to Hrant - I'm not a fan of Arial's 'R' or Helvetica's, but if I had to choose
    one, I'd go with Smellvetica."
