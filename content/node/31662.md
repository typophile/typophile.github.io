  body: "Hello Marcio,\r\n\r\nThis strikes me as something more along the lines of
    custom lettering than something I would create a typeface out of. The idea of
    growth from the letter is fun, but the letters themselves seem very stiff. Is
    that Akzidenz Grotesk? I can't quite tell. You might consider having the skeleton
    be more humanist and letter geometric.\r\n\r\nI've also taken the liberty to re-attach
    the image here. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helena_4869.gif]"

  body: "Interesting concept, although I think that the base letters could have a
    more 'organic' look themselves. (Of course, I'm rather new here, so this is my
    first time doing a type critique...)\r\n\r\n- Richard"

  body: I really like it. (Thanks, Miss Tiffany for re-attaching the image, as I  got
    an error msg when trying to view the original.) Personally, I like the contrast
    between the simple letterforms and the more organic outgrowths; sort of like the
    letters were man-made and left out in the woods for a long time and all these
    things started growing out of them. Wish I could see it more clearly, and would
    really like to see it in color(s). What I like most about this face is that it
    seems you really enjoyed creating it!

  body: "The ornaments are really great, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to agree
    with the others on the used font.\r\nDid you design all the ornaments yourself
    or just took bits & pieces from existing ornamental dingbats? I did a few  \"collages\"
    of dingbats about 2 years ago & I wanted it to look more ornamental, but I haven't
    really found any nice ornamental dingbats. I used a lot of pieces from Ardenwood
    (http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=ardenwood) which has an original
    look to it."

  body: "Thank you for the praises.  \r\nI really had a lot of satisfaction in creating
    the font HELENA.  \r\nI made a collage of several ornaments (dingbats) with a
    more geometric font.  \r\nTo do the download (DEMO) of the font HELENA, access
    the site:  \r\nhttp://www.elifont.com/font.php?font=11606  \r\nHugs and thank

  body: "@mhirosse Just stumbled across your post while searching the forum.\r\n\r\nBeautiful
    ornamentation on the typeface HELENA. I'd love to see you revisit the connection
    points where the Terminals flow out into dingbats. The transition is a little
    abrupt in the image above. \r\n\r\nVery nice work.\r\n\r\n- Rusty"
