  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My freelance identity needs to be updated. For now, I have decided to continue to use my name. But, I've been wondering if I should I create a business name (would it seem more professional/substantial or just gimicky)?  I know it's a very personal decision, but I'm curious as to the process others have used to come up with their names, is it ok to use a private joke? Does it have to be something the client &quot;gets&quot;? Also, many of the other posts have debated over whether or not an individual should have a personal logo. I feel that as a graphic designer the answer is yes. Attached are 2 business card designs, please let me know what you think, if you have a preference, and how you think they can be improved upon. Thanks in advance, I value all of your input.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41082.jpg" alt="kncard a"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41083.jpg" alt="kncard b"></div>

Keawekane is both difficult to say and hard to remember, for most people. <BR> <BR>Your typelogo has good potential. I can see that you are lining up the &quot;N&quot;s (although, optically, the bottom/darker &quot;N&quot; looks larger) at the end of the names, and the leg of the &quot;K&quot; continues down to create the crossbar of the &quot;N&quot;. I'm not sure if I like it, as is; but, I'm not sure why either. The large &quot;N&quot; seems too wide, but I can't put my finger on what else is bothering me. <BR> <BR>You have kind of a cool &quot;K-N&quot; shape coming out of the &quot;K-i&quot;. Have you tried fiddling with anything like this. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41088.jpg" alt="KN monogram"> <BR> <BR>I definitely like the landscape bizcard layout better, but I'm not crazy about either. I've read your critiques in this forum, and I know you are capable of better. It's just hard to design for yourself</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kirsten &ndash; I definitely think that a good personal name is one of the best options when a graphic design is choosing a company name. Your name is great for that purpose, easy to say, easy to remember. <BR> <BR>The way you have executed it, I see an arrangement of 'classical typography with some effects'. <BR> <BR>The effects: <BR> <BR>1 <BR>Very crowded arrangement. <BR>(Too crowded: Ki, AV (in particular) and VI) <BR> <BR>2 <BR>Alignment of whatever can be aligned <BR>(Unless it has Herb Lubalin-like quality I try to avoid alignments like NN and (in particular) the diagonal KN &ndash; they seem a little ackward) <BR> <BR>3 <BR>Mixture of UC and lc (i, s and t being lc) <BR>(It's ok to mix, I guess) <BR> <BR>4 <BR>The st-ligature <BR>To the casual spectator the arrangement is basically UC, so the ligature is a little out of place &ndash; I'm just being the devil's advocate here!) <BR> <BR>It's a well-balanced logo, but I don't think 'classical feeling' together with 1-4 does the job. The biggest drawback is that you show the world what you regard as good typography, or good design &hellip; and those alignments aren't so modern &hellip; <BR> <BR>I think you should consider other ways of writing that name. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR>Soren O</div>

Have you experimented with different ways to incorporate something like this?

		<div class="commentbody">The changes is for the better, but I *still* think that the solution can be characterized as 'classical type, with a lot of effects'. I think it is obvious that there is no Great Idea. <BR> <BR>Look at the identity of the top-50 designers round the world. My guess: either they have a Great Idea. Or they have 'nothing' (&quot;We are too busy doing great jobs for our clients, we don't have time to take our own medicine&quot;). <BR> <BR>My advice is to take a pause, look at what succesful design firms have done, and then redesign. <BR> <BR>If you should go with one of the four, I agree with Sally: the bottom left is the least busy/crowded one. And this has to do with the name mark you have made. There is at least 6-8 focus points, points of interest, built in the name mark. It is very 'complicated'. Consequently, I should have amble free space around &hellip; and the rest of the layout should have few typographic variations.  <BR> <BR>I hope it's o.k. to be the devil's advocate here &hellip; I guess you take the advice you think you need &hellip; and leave the rest &hellip; ;-) <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR>Soren O</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Designing your personal identity is the hardest thing for a designer to do. I try and think of myself(as a designer) identityless. If you have no identity as a designer than you are flexible and organic to your clients. If you present a very classcal identiy to a potential client then you run the risk of being stereotyped as a classic designer. If you present a ultra-modern identity than you will alienate those clients looking for a classic feel. A designer is not a brand, a designer designs brands.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all, and I take your comments in the spirit in which they were given - to help me improve my mark. If I just wanted to hear &quot;it's wonderful&quot; I'd show them to my Mom. Your sensitivity on a very personal project is appreciated. It's definately the hardest kind of work and probably the most vunerable too. You're voicing many of my own concerns that have been nagging at me but I've been squashing. While looking over past projects trying to determine &quot;my style&quot; I was a little discouraged to see no unifying look. Hopefully that is a strength - meeting the client's specific needs rather than imposing an pre-established treatment. I understand the trap David wrote of, having a classically designed mark and putting off cutting edge prospective clients and vice versa. However how does one design an identity that says 'I'm a designer, I can do your project no matter your needs/style'. My identity will be my first impression. I don't want my card to get lost in the shuffle and be mistaken for an accountant's. some more research will help I'm sure. Does anyone have recommendations of good, or even bad (shows you what to avoid) self-identity logos?</div>

I need a font with a single junction on the cap K.  So far I'm using Gill Sans Light (I don't care for the cap R in Univers or Futura). I'm also trying two serif fonts, Perpetua and Trajan. Again I need a single junction K but it needs to be a face with very little contrast. The leg on the Trajan K seems too swash-y. It still needs to be refined and perhaps a different font choice (Suggestions Please!) But overall, I like this direction. What does the forum think?

		<div class="commentbody">I had been playing with other layouts. But what struck me about the centered version was the creation of the triangle out of the stacked KN mark and the type. The new shape even repeats the K from the mark when the card is held on the vertical. Perhaps it's too subtle. My intention was to find the right font and then refine the layout which will also need to be applied to other formats - it may not work on a letterhead design.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not too happy about the recent variantions.  <BR> <BR>As I see it, the arrangement on your business card tells the following story. <BR> <BR>1 <BR>I like Gill Sans. It's a beautiful font with high legibility. <BR> <BR>2 <BR>I feel something is missing, so I will center the lines. <BR> <BR>3 <BR>I still fell it lacks something, so I will write my initials with Uppercase and the rest of the names in small caps <BR> <BR>4 <BR>So &hellip; the design is finished! <BR> <BR>Kirsten, it would be a pity to stop at this point. This four-step procedure is what millions of people do every day. You should show that you can take design further! <BR> <BR>I know you have included a symbol, but it doesn't seem to be so interesting &hellip; maybe it could be developed, I don't know. <BR> <BR>The triangular shape you refer to is not IMHO a thing to try to achieve. With the symbol on top, it makes the arrangement look like a christmas tree. <BR> <BR>You become a writer by reading books. You become a designer by seeing design. I think you should force yourself to look at a lot of top-professional identity &hellip; I mean, you should really do it! &hellip; and then go back to the drawing board. <BR> <BR>I look forward to discuss this further with you and the rest of the forum &hellip; <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR>Soren O</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here are some new identity designs. What I had liked about my last post was using a simple grahic element along with the name, although the stylized K and N weren't working. They did however remind me of signal flags so I looked up what the signal flags would be for my initals and incorporated them into most of the attached designs. Signal flags are a form of visual communication which is what graphic design is all about. The K flag means I want to communicate with you. But the N flag stands for no or negative - not  a great concept to associate with one's id. however, historically it also used to symbolize rendezvous. I don't expect a lot of people to actually decypher the flag symbols. I do hope it will be fairly self evident that they represent K and N, but the flags are simple enough to just be graphic elements. Also, a subtle nautical theme seems appropriate on a personal level. But that goes back to some of my original questions, how reflective/personal should a personal identity be? Any way, your thoughts on this latest round would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41861.jpg" alt="middle"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41862.jpg" alt="box"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41863.jpg" alt="left"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41864.jpg" alt="split"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41865.jpg" alt="noflag"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting concept Kirsten, however as you say yourself most people will not understand what these symbols mean. I know i wouldn't if you hadn't explained it before. Looking at the graphics as they are without knowing the story it would leave me wondering. The symbols itself don't feel like they are a mark since they are not connected graphically. Thus, forgetting about the original meaning, if it was just one of the flags i would agree that it is a symbol that could exist simply as looking nice. <BR> <BR>From the choices you posted i like the first ones most, with the flags in the middle. This arrangement holds the flags together and makes it feel more solid. <BR> <BR>Personally however, i am a little sad you are walking away from your original approach. Your name has a nice sound to it and the slightly classy look seems to fit well. I would have liked to see something like this, with less effects which complicated the type too much.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dude, Tom, I disagree 100%. Why do you have to hit people over the head with gaudy design? It takes a real designer to create an dynamic composition with very few elements that is logical and considerate of the content and the viewing audience. Kirsten, if you have some class, which I'm sure you do, then you won't have to bombard your clients and friends with an overly designed identity that is designed for designs sake. LESS IS MORE. Lure them in with sophistication and class. Concentrate on typesetting and simplicity. Make beautiful words at considerate point sizes in a considerate legible clean typeface. When I see great buisness card it is done with extreme class and a very slight but elegant touch of style. IMPO light on the style heavy on the Class.</div>

David, after viewing past posts it is obvious your style is clean and simple, which is fine. It does not mean things that are more graphic are gaudy. <BR> <BR>Kristen is a graphic designer and her clients want to get a taste of her skills. If she decides that simple &amp; clean type is the way to go then great, but if she goes another direction it doesn't mean it's bombardment.

		<div class="commentbody">Kirsten: <BR> <BR>I think I'm going to have to lean toward Tom's direction here. If I understand David correctly, I think he may have read a little too much into Tom's &quot;billboard&quot; comment. I agree with David, in that a designer's identity shouldn't alienate clients by overdesigning too much of their own unique style into it (unless the designer wants to specialize and their objective is to target a very specific clientelle); but, I also agree with Tom, in that a business card can play a very powerful role in making or breaking a meaningful marketing or communications opportunity between you and a potential client. Afterall, most of us don't have much of a budget for marketing and signage, and until you get a client into your door, there is a good chance they will never see your portfolio. In my personal experience, only about 10% or less of my clients ever see my portfolio. My visual portfolio has yet to make a difference in whether or not I land a job. What I would call my relationship/experience portfolio is what brings in the work, or rather, results in the referrals that keep me working. <BR> <BR>I apologize for taking up so much of your critique space here, Kirsten, but this seems to be a worthwhile discussion. <BR> <BR>Below is my logo on my stationary suite (a product of this forum). I am posting this because it supports the points that both David and Tom have made. The logotype is a derivative of Clarendon, which is a timeless typeface with subtle enough alteration that I believe David would approve of it. The stationary suite, however, is a selling tool. I use the two PMS colors, die cutting/punch cutting (&quot;Q&quot; and radius corners), letterpress, and stock selection as an example of how I can customize a piece that all of my clients use, but few of them have capitalized on for differentiation. Of course there are better pieces to illustrate this, but I can't carry them around wherever I go. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41992.jpg" alt="Creative Squeeze"> <BR> <BR>Kirsten, I prefered your initial direction better than your last postings. I just think you still have some work to do on the type. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott's excellent stationary is an example of not only using type, but also his creativity and strong sense of color to create an attractive presentation. It would not have the same effect if he just used Claredon without customizing it and making it unique.  <BR> <BR>Also, billboards can be made to look appealing and classy. It all depends on who you are marketing to. My experience with clients has been that they care more for graphics than the kerning (not that you can't do both). Our job as GRAPHIC designers is to show that we can use type as well as graphics (usually) to get a point across. Clients I have had want to see creativity. How else are you going to seperate yourself from their local print shop?</div>

Will post again soon. <BR> <BR>Tom, no problem mis-spelling my name. happens all the time. hopefully I will come up with a design so memorable people won't only remember my name but how to spell it as well. that is what I was trying to accomplish in my initial designs by mixing up the font so much. <BR> <BR>Scott, great inspiration thanks for the posting. <BR> <BR>S</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here are some revised designs. I went back to my original concept and simplified the overstyled logotype. I decided to keep the ital &quot;i&quot;, visually I like having one character with a twist and hopefully it's contrast to the roman will be a reminder of the correct spelling and pronuncation. The first posting is the logotype itself followed by possible business card applications. I thought about Daniel's comment about process and so, two cards have a die-cut and fold. I haven't decided upon colors yet, so if some of the shades appear different it's not your monitor nor your eves. Finally, I tried to rework the flag concept into something I like but nothing was successful. I kept hearing David's and Andrew's comments ringing in my ears.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42532.jpg" alt="knlogotype"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42533.jpg" alt="knlogotypecard"> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42534.jpg" alt="knlogotypecard3"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42535.jpg" alt="knlogotypecard2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">You might try and examine some other typefaces. I personally feel that the Roman you have chosen might be a little stiff condsidering the direcition of the cards and color palette. I feel like you could get a little more out of the italic in a typeface known for it's italics.(Old Style Romans: BEMBO GAROMONDS JENSON CASLONS) Right know the i feels a little to up and down. A trick to kerning this baby would be to add a few other letters (Capital &quot;O&quot; and C are good) When you add those letters you might get a better since of the overall letterspacing necessary. Right know the spacing is entirily to tight. Another trick would be to space the letters way out and make them gradually tighter as needed.   <BR> <BR>In summary &quot;Make the &quot;i&quot; feel special&quot;</div>

Right now the negative space is being crammed by the positive spave. I would try Adding one full natural space in between the letters and see how it feels. IMPO an all small caps version is better than an all Caps/Small Caps version. I think you might disagree but when you open up the letterspacing you will see why I feel that in my gut. the K and the N are way too dominant. The italic i should be the subtly dominant feature of your logo. right now the K and N are cramming the i's elegance. Give the i some breathing room!</div>

If miller doesn't have a small caps(although I'm sure it does!) you might have to customize the i to make it larger so that you have a balanced cap height across the board. <BR>Consider using the italics for your address and phone# and other stuff. You might want to think about the italics as representing your personal voice. <BR> <BR>IMPORTANT: Don't use the small caps button in quark. All that button does is shrink the regular caps smaller. The small caps of a specific font are a sepearte typeface all to themselves. Miller should have one available to purchase.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It was sort of a joke, I know s/c and l/c are different. But to be honest not all of the fonts that I used have a small caps version - they may, I just don't own them at the moment. Miller is one such example. I'm not 100% sold on Miller but the more I look at it the more it's growning on me. And if it ends up being my final choice I will see if there's a small caps version. If I haven't mentioned it in my most recent posts, Thanks again, your insight has been a tremendous help. I like the suggestion of using itals for the other info. (was starting to play with which sans would work with my last 4 font choices) But do you think it's ok to use an ital for an e-mail address? I would suppose so, since it's not like using caps where someone possibly would type in caps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Truthfully I think this is on the way to really being something elegant and refined with the slight touch of pesonality that you were pushing for since the beginning. There is just enough personality in that italic i that will potentially cary the your identity to the next level. Good Luck! Less is More!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, <BR> <BR>Westport is the next town over. Do you know it well?  <BR> <BR>From my last posting do you have a favorite font choice? I'm still trying to decide, on the forum there are two votes for Miller, but when I've shown it in print to others they seem to prefer Village Titling. The titling had been my original selection but I'm concerned it will be a little difficult to read at small sizes. So I'm leaning towards Village, in part because I already own it. However, if I'm going to purchase a new font should it be Miller? Does anyone have other suggestions?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Former Connecticut boy I moved into the city 11 yrs ago. Lived in Norwalk, Westport and Weston. I like Village myself don't worry about it in small sizes. I used to have my Idenity in Lublin Graph Ligh. My printer just burned the plate a little longer to make it hold. Just talk to your printer. It seems to me these days the designers are isolated from the printing end of things so they don't include them in the loop. The WYSIWYG thinking. I once saw a catalog where instead of the yellow plate they substituded metalic gold, now that wasn't something you could envision based on a laser print.</div>
