  design related really...\r\n\r\nI need a few typefaces to experiment with that have
  a subtle feeling of prison, confinement, or confidential files and therapy. but
  subtle yes, probably an aged serif will work?\r\n\r\nIt's for a quote that will
  eventually be a tattoo. \r\n\r\nI have no idea where to even start looking for this
  one. If anyone has suggestions on what to use or where to find such a typeface,
  I would love it.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    that relate to confinement or confidential files and therapy. From that list you''ll
    start finding visual clues. For instance you might find the word "bars" if you
    think of a prison. Bars are tall and thin. Word play is a great exercise, but
    don''t start by trying to find the typeface. First give yourself a salad bar of
    words to work from. '

    of prisoners etc & see if a motif or even a typeface jumps out at you."

    retailers</a> and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30824?\">font foundries</a>.\r\n\r\nBut
    Tiff and Eben are correct: flipping through type collections is approaching the
    problem backwards. Start with the idea(s), and mold the specifics to it (them).\r\n\r\nI
    also recommend a copy of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/\">this</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://currentconfig.com/archives/000235.html\">this is why</a>."
