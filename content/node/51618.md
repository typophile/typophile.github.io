body: "Let me try to explain. After i am done tracking and kerning sometimes the space
  in between words looks to large. Is there a setting for this or is it common to
  go into each and every space and reduce the kerning manually to let's say -60. am
  i doing something wrong. please advise. thank you.\r\n\r\njames"

  body: Sometimes its better to go negitive and bump words on a sentence up to the
    last line. I have had the same problem with going possitive. Try it with words
    with dashes

  body: "I'm not sure what you mean exactly. sorry, but thanks for the reply. Here
    is a quick example. I am happy with the tracking and kerning, but want the spaces
    closer. do i do it manually or a setting i'm missing? thanks again. and forget
    any typos. ha.\r\n\r\njames[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Help_5476.jpg]"

  body: "In case you are working with InDesign: Change the wordspacing values in H&J
    if you want tighter word spaces globally.\r\nIf you want to do this on a selection
    (and this is straight from InDesign Help):\r\n\r\nAdjust kerning between words\r\n
    With the Type tool , select a range of text and do one of the following:\r\nTo
    add space between selected words, press Alt+Ctrl+\\ (Windows) or Option+Command+\\
    (Mac OS).\r\nTo remove space between selected words, press Alt+Ctrl+Backspace
    (Windows) or Option+Command+Delete (Mac OS).\r\nTo multiply the kerning adjustment
    by 5, hold down Shift as you press the keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert
