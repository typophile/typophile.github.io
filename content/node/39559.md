  around for some inspiration for my next vintage piece I stumbled across this old
  ad, and I would like to know what the font used for \"Grapette\" might be?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grapette_5077.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks
  :)"

  body: Thanks, Marten. I had already checked with Letterhead; the closest match I
    could find was Royal Script. I thought I would post it here in case this was an
    actual font I was unaware of.

  body: "Your sample looks like something from the 1920's or '30's. If it wasn't metal
    type, it was drawn by hand. We tend to think you can only do lettering like that
    with a computer, but sign and advertising lettering was all some guys did for
    a living in those days, and they were very good at it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
