    is totally insane. \r\n\r\nHere is my font file format, a simple text with a bunch
    of x/y coordinates\r\n<code>\r\n0:0,1|0,4|2,4|2,0|0,0|0,1|2,3\r\n1:1,0|1,4|0,3\r\n2:2,0|0,0|2,2|2,4|0,4\r\n3:0,0|2,0|2,2|0,2|2,2|2,4|0,4\r\n4:2,0|2,4|0,2|2,2\r\n5:0,0|2,2|0,2|0,4|2,4\r\n6:2,4|0,2|0,0|2,0|2,2|0,2\r\n7:2,0|2,4|0,4\r\n8:0,2|0,4|2,4|2,2|0,2|0,0|2,0|2,2\r\n9:0,0|2,2|2,4|0,4|0,2|2,2\r\nT:1,0|1,4|0,4|2,4|\r\nO:0,0|2,0|2,4|0,4|0,0\r\nP:0,0|0,4|2,3|0,2\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIf
    somebody is interested in seeing it running with your own squared font, grab your
    grid sketchbooks!"
