body: A client fell in love with the loopy script font on the cover of Blueprint magazine,
  and the big, bold page numbers. Before I start scouring my font book and using Identifont,
  I thought I'd see if anyone here can ID them since I've never been let down on here.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numbers_5461.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/title_6244.jpg]
