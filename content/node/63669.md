  thin 7pt will have trouble in the printer? I know it's specific but if you guys
  know the font or can compare it to something similar let me know how it will work
  out.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    But I doubt, that it is comfortably legible. And what\u2019s the message? True
    or false modesty?"

    for a photographer and it needs to look clean/modern if that answers your last
    questions. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that a good printer, working with thick stock, will
    be able to make it how I want."

    is the colour of the font and then only if it is an extremely light tint. \r\n"
