  \u2018g\u2019 with a less steep contrast axis than their \u2018o\u2019. Fred Smeijers
  <em>Quadraat</em> is an example. This made me wonder if it is a size-related optical
  adjustment, or something one does to better balance the complex shape of the letter.
  In the case of Quadraat, it might just be a byproduct of compressing the \u2018o\u2019
  vertically, but it would surpise me if a master like Smeijers didn\u2019t do this
  on purpose. Conceptually, a more regularized design for smaller sizes does make
  a lot of sense to me. Are there examples of small-size masters that do this? "

  body: "Hi Frode, \r\nThe  top part of lowercase g of Quadraat has not much in common
    with the lowercase o.\r\nIt is made deliberately like this: the aim was to have
    the enclosed top-counter as big as possible. So, you have to enlarge it to the
    left and to the right. You can not go down because that would influence the balance
    of the lowercase g in a negative way immediately. Back then I had learned this
    from the work of Pierre Haultin. \r\nHope this helps,\r\nFred"

  body: "Thank you so much for writing, Fred. As I wrote, I was not sure of the origins
    of this in Quadraat. I have noticed it in many other types too. In my own feeble
    attempts at drawing a serif typeface, I\u2019ve shaped the head of \u2018g\u2019
    independently because I find the presence of the flag and the connection to the
    loop requires it. But then came this idea, that maybe it also needs to be slightly
    more upright because it is smaller. Like how the diacritical marks are generally
    given a much more symmetrical contrast (actually, I sometimes think they have
    more of a reverse-contrast, but that is another discussion). Have you seen any
    types that employ a less steep axis for smaller sizes?"

      common thing to do, so its axis is less slanted than the matching lc-o. It is
      not a law of course. But my feel is that it must be done quite often in faces
      with contrast. The reason might have to do a lot with balancing the optical
      axis of the whole letter g. \r\nI might have seen faces with a less steep axis,
      but in a haste won't recall any.\r\nBest, \r\nFred"

    (which in some cases might be the contrast axis) would benefit from being toned
    down as the size gets smaller, but I am not concluding \u2013 just asking questions:
    For example, why are diacritical marks often drawn symmetrical, even if the alphabet
    is not? \r\n\r\n"
