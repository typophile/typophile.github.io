  \r\n\r\n1. Are system fonts came with OS installation disc(XP, Mac OS X) free to
  be published/embedded with commercial software developed by a company?\r\n2. What
  about those localized fonts(ie, Chinese Heiti)?\r\n3. What about embed a Mac font
  into a mac/windows compatible commercial software?\r\n\r\nAny advices are appreciated.\r\nKyle"

    they\u2019re already on the end-users computers anyway."

  body: "thanks for the answer.\r\n\r\nIt's a pity though in this case. I am asking
    this question since I'd like to embed some system fronts from Mac OS X and make
    it both available for Mac and XP use, the fonts Mac system provides do not come
    with Microsoft XP. What's even worse is the (chinese) fonts Mac OS X has is not
    for sale from the vendor.\r\n\r\nAm I stuck with looking for 3rd-party fonts only?"

    Mac fonts are licensed, so I'm sure Adobe, Monotype, Linotype, ITC etc., or the
    owners of other Apple supplied fonts would be happy to sell you a redistribution
    license. Things are even easier with Windows XP fonts, many of these can be licensed
    for redistribution from Ascender Corp. \r\n"
