body: These are scans from a book called <i>The Problem of the Media</i>, by Robert
  McChesney, published 2004. I tried Identifont to no avail. It seems very familiar
  but I can&#39;t put my finger on it. I don&#39;t know if it has small caps, but
  they aren&#39;t used in the book. OsFs are, but they are a little darker than the
  rest of the text, which I thought was strange. Anyway, here goes... <BR> <BR><img

  <BR> <BR>It isn&#39;t as noticeable on screen, but in the actual physical book the
  figures appear much darker than everything else, almost as if it&#39;s a bold weight.
  My wife is trying to go to sleep and is not well pleased with my noise-making, so
  good night.

  body: Thanks, and congrats on that third ID. <BR> <BR>I was thinking Dutch, didn&#39;t
    want to assume. Any thought on why the figures are so dark?

  body: I think they used Swift Regular Small Caps for figures, the rest of text being
    Swift Light.  <BR> <BR>Regular Small Caps seems to be the only Swift with OSF.
