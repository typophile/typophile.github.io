body: I have a gig designing DVD covers for a wrestling company. It's a pretty fun
  little project, you get to do some design that wouldn't really fly with other companies.
  They like to have a different style of "logo" for every event. I was wondering if
  anyone had any advice for good, strong typefaces that would suit the intended audience?

    in this case.\r\nAs for strong typefaces in different styles, you could search
    for octagonal (as per Adam\u2019s suggestion), inserat, wood, slab, blackletter,
    stencil, fat, etc."
