  8' banners that will be hung on the exterior of a building staggered from the 2nd
  floor about 20' up to the roof about 60'up. They will be viewed at multiple levels,
  ground floor primarily, but can also be seen from the windows of each floor, and
  looked down at from the roof. The banners will only feature text.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any advice about special considerations to make for typography at such a large
  scale? I am primarily concerned about legibility. What would be an appropriate type
  size for something displayed up to 60' away? and is there any treatment done to
  acommadate the viewing angle? Are you aware of any literature on the subject? \r\n\r\nThank
  you."

    Vision tends to blends things at any real distance. Your text will bleed of into
    infinity if it crowds the edge and bleed together if it is too close. \r\n\r\nGive
    yourself some decent contrast. \r\n\r\nChoose a font with some decent weight to
    all the strokes but not too bold. And, according the the USDOT, a 2 inch sanserif
    character can be read from 50 feet. \r\n\r\nI'm certain there are documents on
    the subject, I just never got the chance to read them.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    find some good info from the ADA aswell.
