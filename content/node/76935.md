body: "hi guys,\r\n\r\nbeen trying to work this out for while now - not after the
  logo's typeface although if someone does know that too that would be useful. what
  I'm trying to find out is what the text the ingredients and other text is in? \r\n\r\nI
  know nairns have used gill sans in the past for leaflets, but its not that as the
  small letter \"g\" is only single tiered.  If anyone can help I'd be really greatful,
  I've attached an image of the pack... thanks..."

  body: ^^that looks like a very close match. it most reminded me of frutiger and
    futura, but Avenir looks more accurate... just checking it agains all the letters...
    the C looks perfectly matched and it has the small x-height...
