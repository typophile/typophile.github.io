  members of European Parliament urged the creation of a new comprehensive road typeface
  system, the development of a \u2018general high recognition and perception font\u2019,
  and recommended adoption of uniform design practices. Now, after five years of extensive
  research, the European Committee for Uniformity of Type Design and Type Safety completed
  the research and presented legible-for-all-purposes-suitable-typeface. The typeface,
  named Euroface, was developed and studied through extensive design exercises, laboratory
  investigation and road tests. The result is convincing: Euroface is 42% more legible
  than Helvetica</em>\"\r\n\r\n42% More legible than Helvetica? Oh my. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to find a sample of it.\r\n\r\nThat may not be so easy though.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.a-g-i.org/magazine/news_detail.php?id=252&cat=\r\n\r\n\"<em>A
  German attempt to create one 'Euroface' for the European road signs scored astonishingly
  high in legibility tests. However, until today the typeface has remained hidden
  in bureaucratic drawers despite its supposedly magical qualities.</em>\"\r\n\r\nRuss\r\n\r\n"

    that gets easier to read the faster you drive! No wonder they had to invent a

  body: I must confess that I am skeptic but I found Euroface as part of Lecture 7
    of this <a href="http://teched.vt.edu/gcc/PDFs/TypoCompMarjorieCrum.pdf"><strong>Typography
    &amp; Composition Course Outline</strong></a>.  Euroface is also mentioned on
    page 132 (page 27 of the pdf file) of <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/Rules/Painting_with_Print.pdf"><strong>this
    issue</strong></a> of the Journal of the Association of Legal Writing Directors
    (whose existence I did not know). I liked footnote 121.

    \r\n\r\nI was kidding about there being a big international union of type designers
    who would of course want to suppress a typeface that would be so good there' it
    would put them out of business - and of course, if there were such a union, it
    would be powerful enough to influence governments. "
