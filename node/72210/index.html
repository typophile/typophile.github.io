  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everybody, this is my first post here, I became a member to get some critique. (and inspiration!)

I'm currently designing a, more or less, thematic font that I started 2 years ago but picked up recently again. My question is: What implication do rounded corners have on a font, I just got the idea to make the corners a little softer but i am not sure if it works or what is better or what fits better.

I included a pdf to show you the differenc, which is only noticable at large corpses now I guess. I do think softer corners do look better on screen


Any advice anyone?


(P.S- this is the light weight of my font)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hm, I'm not sure exactly what the implications are, aside from making it less sharp/angular on the page...

I haven't printed your PDF, but the effect does seem to be extremely subtle... I think that whatever you're more comfortable with is fine.

As far as the face itself, it's hard to comment on; so far it seems very consistent—perhaps even a little too much so (if there is such a thing). That is, all of the terminals and serifs are identical; I think it would be nice to introduce some variation, so that each character would appear to be a unique drawing made by the same "pen." If nothing else, I think some alternates couldn't hurt.

Also, what is the intent of the font? I presume this is for display purposes; will there be a lower case?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hi, thnx for the reply!

The whole font is basically my own font to use on business cards and other expressions of my own 'corporate identity' shall I say... or just for fun, no specific purpose (shame shame, that's not what i learned in school)

There will be: 

-lowercase, capitals, smallcaps, ligatures, oldstyle numerals, numerals, etc.
-3 weights, light, medium & bold 
-roman version & cursive version of every weight.

(then maybe stylistic alternates like swash... maybe a 'black' weight)

Maybe I take consistency too serious? I think it's very important, but the terminals are actually different from the serifs. Look at the left top serif of the M, the terminal of the K, and the terminals of the T (or is that a seriph?) They are all different from the regular serif (look at the bottom of the F)
