  are BBT and Rail Model fonts.\r\nThere is Regular, Bold, Italic with also Upper
  and Lower case together on keycaps.\r\nThe keyboards alter the suicidal k/K shaped
  letter on the keyboard, see http://Kalphabet.googlepages.com.\r\nThere 16 images
  are also attached as files and there is also pdf file with the 16 options. \r\nI
  have attached 2 fonts from where the 16 options originate.  "

    are all very nice ones, none of them particularly closely resemble the typefaces
    most commonly found on computer keyboards.\r\n\r\nI would say that 2. or 4. are
    the most suitable to that application of the choices provided, however."

    want to narrow the choices down first, but at some point you need a good mockup
    to evaluate. Wouldn't be too hard to do in Photoshop. "

  body: "@aluminum:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHowever, I could be too hasty. First, the OP should
    talk about this directly to his fellow members in his little breakaway group of
    former Hare Krishna members, and see what <em>they</em> think of it.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    some of them would be interested. If not, broader appeal to other Hindus would
    be unlikely; and, of course, as I keep noting, anyone not a Hindu (since most
    other religions aren't syncretistic, and so anything allegedly supernatural from
    outside their own tradition is either a fake or done by demons) would obviously
    have no interest whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOur cultural perspective is, of course, so
    shaped by an Abrahamic faith being the paradigm of religion for us, that to us
    it's axiomatic that faith-based reasons have zero validity to anyone outside their
    originating faith."
