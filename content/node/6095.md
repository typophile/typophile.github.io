  body: This has a few very unsual features, especially the &#39;f&#39; that goes
    below the baseline. It also has a single-storey &#39;g&#39;, and a double-storey
    &#39;a&#39; along with the Venetian-style &#39;e&#39;. The only typeface I have
    found with all those attributes so far is M.F. Benton&#39;s &#39;Motto&#39; from
    1915 &#40;see McGrew, p. 224&#41;. Motto is a calligraphic style, so is not a
    match. <BR> <BR>I would say this is not a Fraktur, by the way. <BR> <BR>Judging
    from the name of this sample, is this book from Romania? How old is it? We are
    probably looking at a European metal type, and once again my books have little
    to show of these types. What the world needs is a McGrew-style book for European
    typefaces. <BR> <BR>One existing face that reminds me of this a bit is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/seagull/"
    target="_blank">&#39;Seagull&#39;</a>, although it doesn&#39;t have the long &#39;f&#39;.
    It has a rather monotone stroke , like this sample, giving it a darker look on
    the page, and a large x-height like this.

  body: Well, I had a hunch it wasn&#39;t Fraktur also... <BR>Anyway, if this might
    help, the book is from Romania, and it was printed in 1921. Seagull is much too
    rounded to be a match. Perhaps a zoomed-in picture will help?

  body: Yes, I know Seagull is not a match. I only suggested that it has a similar
    look on a page &#40;if you do not look too closely at the letters themselves&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The lettering style looks similar to some old German types from early
    in 20th century and Art Nouveau era &#40;see the &#39;A&#39; in your sample&#41;,
    but I cannot find an exact match. I think only someone with old books about European
    typefaces will be able to help with this. I would be willing to bet that there
    is no modern font that matches it. <BR> <BR>I am out of information. Sorry.
