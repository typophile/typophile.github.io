body: 'Using mainly PHP-mySQL scripts, with a little Javascript thrown in, I have
  created an online script to render input text into images, using ligatures where
  appropriate. <BR> <BR>Currently only a single typeface is available, named Burgerserve,
  it is created by my brother Christopher Washer. Its narrow form is available, only
  in lowercase. No numbers, uppercase or punctuation are available, the typeface itself
  is still being developed. <BR> <BR>You can find out more about it and the script
  itself here: <a href="http://nefariousf.freeserverhost.com/typerender/index.php">TypeRender
  1.0</a>. I will also add a page describing how it functions for those who have some
  knowledge of php.'

  body: Note that without JavaScript enabled &#40;some recent issue with IE and/or
    SP2 can do this&#41;, the select boxes will not appear correctly, but due to there
    being only a single typeface, this has no effect on the script and isnt a problem.

  body: You mean GIFwrapper. Yes, that probably predates <BR>my stuff, although it
    was more of a heading scheme, <BR>while I was talking about text. <BR> <BR>hhp
