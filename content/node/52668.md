  to generate a .otf font from the same .vfb file i can generate a .ttf file with.
  It doesn\u2019t give me any warning, FL just freezes at 92% while trying to generate
  the .otf font. I tried to save the .vfb file under a new name. It still generates
  .ttf but not .otf. How can i detect what\u2019s wrong?"

  body: i'm guessing that there may be problems with some of your character outlines.
    you might try opening the generated TTF file in FontLab and then trying to generate
    an OTF font from that file, that sometimes works for me. Otherwise, you may want
    to go back through glyph-by-glyph and check for outline errors that you can correct.
    It may be that you have too many points on some glyphs?

  body: "Thanks Paul,\r\n\r\nGenerating .otf from .ttf is still not working. What
    do you consider too many points on some glyphs? This is happening just with this
    particular font. The letters are made of dots (sixteen per cap height), so, of
    course there are many points. Why is .otf having problems with too many points?
    I wouldn\u2019t mind just generating .ttf, BUT: .ttf is turning the circular dots
    into squarish shapes that i don\u2019t like to have. Also in some glyphs it makes
    some dots heavier and others thinner (which is probably a hinting issue)."

  body: "J\xFCrgen, \r\n\r\nif your font is very repetitive (e.g. consists just of
    dots or squares), then the subroutinization can take a really long time, sometimes
    20 minutes, and for a large font even more. The result then is a very small font
    but well, the generation takes time. This is how it works, it's not a \"problem\".
    \r\n\r\nBut if you don't care much about the font size, then you can turn of the
    subroutinization and the generation process will be much faster. \r\n\r\nIn fact,
    Mac OS X 10.4 sometimes has problems with heavily-subroutinized fonts so actually
    it may make sense to turn it off altogether. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Adam,\r\n\r\nOk, thanks for clarifying this. The font size is indeed big.
    When i am more patient, i will try to wait for the subroutinization process.\r\nBut
    lately i have also strange behaviour -- when generating OTF from a normal font
    -- that one or two glyphs (h and i or l) don\u2019t show up in applications. They
    print however. It was easy to solve by just pasting the glyph into the cell window
    anew. But i never had this before. And it didn\u2019t occur when generating TTF.\r\n\r\n@

  body: "Blimey - it worked! :)\r\n\r\nI had two fonts that had all sorts of strange
    behaviour in OpenType format (on MacOSX 10.4), but worked fine in TrueType. Yes,
    both fonts contained repetitive elements, and I suspected that was somehow the
    culprit. I though I had tried turning off \"subroutine compression\" before generating
    too, but I probably had some remnants in some cache or something...\r\nI tried
    unchecking and regenerating now, and both fonts work fine :)\r\n\r\nI have upgraded
    to 10.5 in the meantime, so that may have helped, though...\r\n\r\nYes, the file
    size balooned, but at least the fonts work!\r\nLesson learned: turn off subroutine
    compression before generating OpenType fonts with very repetitive elements.\r\nThanks!

  body: "Yes, actually, the bug in Mac OS X is very annoying. After all, the point
    of the compression through subroutines was to get the smallest possible size,
    and this worked especially good in fonts with repetitive elements -- but such
    fonts actually \"bomb\" in Mac OS X 10.4 if using the compression. \r\n\r\nSo
    basically, whenever you'd theoretically get the best possible results using the
    compression, you actually have to resign from the compression at all. "
