  am creating an open source font for Gregorian chant (http://www.marello.org/projects/caeciliae)
  and I am interested in recommending other free fonts that would work well for the
  accompanying text. Some very basic requirements:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>short hyphen (these
  come up a lot in the chant text, and smaller = less obtrusive)\r\n</li><li>acute
  accented \xE6 and \u0153 if possible (in case those don't come out correctly, they're
  ae and oe ligatures)\r\n</li><li>other standard ligatures would be a great plus\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\nI
  like Cardo, but wow: it has a long hyphen.\r\n\r\nThanks for any thoughts or recommendations.

  body: "Well, regarding the long hyphen in Cardo, you could horizontally compress
    its hyphen to the size you want (if that's possible in whatever program you're
    working in). Since it's just a straight horizontal line in Cardo, there shouldn't
    be any distortion as there normally is when compressing or expanding glyphs.\r\n\r\nA
    free font that I've heard good things about is <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium>Gentium</a>,
    but I don't know whether its hyphen is any shorter."

    ae and oe ligatures are there as well as ae accented."

    (pdf) specimen and proofs at the bottom of  this <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_download\">link</a>.
    \r\n\r\n[edit] I mean there is just one weight (there is no bold roman, no bold
    italics)"
