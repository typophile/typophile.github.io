  won't just put me in touch with the design house that created the title treatment
  attached or seen here: [[http://fox.com/dontforget/]] and I need to ID the font.
  I KNOW I probably have it but after going through my entire FontExplorer X library
  one by one (over 3000+) and using Identifont, I'm no closer to having a match.\r\n\r\nIt's
  not Droid [[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=1065]] and it's not
  SF Eccentric Opus [[http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/8696]] \u2014 but I am fairly
  certain this is a common-ish font, right? Must be.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? I've got my
  fingers crossed that you smarties will come to my rescue again. As usual many, many
  thanks in advance! I'll owe you a Coke\u2122!\r\n\r\np.s. Don't yell at me for knowing
  the cheap-o knock-off fonts right off the bat! I have many thousands of dollars
  worth of legit, licensed and paid-for fonts!!  ; ) "

    Bold and Triline.\r\n\r\nBtw, to get this ID, I just used Gimp to rotate the word
    \"Don't\" back to upright, and uploaded the image to WhatTheFont. It's a very
    good resource, and even better when you give it a little manual help."
