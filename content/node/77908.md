body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've been wondering if there are different names for the way
  an 'a' is shaped?\r\nWhether it's an 'a' with a little roof over its head, or an
  'a' that looks like it has just eaten a beachball.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDriz"

  body: The roofed one is a two-story a, the beach ball a one-story a (like in a building).
    The same terms are sometimes used for the different forms of lowercase g.
