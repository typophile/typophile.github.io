body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Hello. <BR>I have a brief at
  college to design a new idea for a shop and create the brand and graphics &#40;logo,
  packaging, swing tags, look for the interior/shop front.&#41;  I am doing an ice
  cream parlor but I am not sure whether to try to make it look more modern or something
  with a retro twist - such as from this other post I made:  <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?83/70178"
  target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?83/70178</a> <BR> <BR>The
  idea is that the shop would sell ice creams and also non-dairy alternatives.  Working
  title is &#34;Milk Bar&#34;! <BR> <BR>Would love to hear any suggestions.  I live
  in the UK so unfortunately I dont get to see as many great ice cream parlors as
  in the US or Italy.  We get the usual Ben and Jerry&#39;s and Haagen-Dazs etc.&#60;/font&#62;'

    Diner &#40;lots of free fonts&#41;. Modern = carb free, no fat. Retro = fun, no
    guilt

    Ehehe. How sad is that. Bring on the full-fat cream! <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t forget
    that Font Bureau has some great typefaces reminiscent of that era as well.

  body: Yes definitely I think with modern life we want all the taste and none of
    the cals!   <BR> <BR>The links are very helpful thanks!  I like the colours reminiscent
    of that era too. I am developing the logo at the moment, trying not to be too
    obvious ie. other ways of showing ice cream without drawing an ice cream or whirls!

    a mark using an inverted bowler hat conflated with an udder. <BR> <BR>Also, everyone
    should temporarily stop using the word conflate.

  body: Cheryl, the fonts you asked to be ID&#39;d are a lot of fun. I think you could
    do a modern take via those &#34;retro&#34; fonts.  <BR> <BR>James, funny that
    &#34;Milk Bar&#34; takes you straight to &#34;Clockwork Orange&#34;. I get the
    idea though and it could be a lot of fun.

  body: Clockwork Orange!? I&#39;ve not seen the film personally, but I&#39;m not
    sure I&#39;d want to associate my ice cream shop with a murderer! :p  James, I
    have checked out the link and I like how they&#39;ve carried the theme into the
    environment.   <BR>I think I will try to go in a similar style to the fonts I
    asked to be ID&#39;d. I am reading a couple of books about retail graphics, for
    ideas of how to apply the style to the interior/shop front.  This project is fictional
    so I don&#39;t get to work with interior designers &#40;!&#41;, so if anyone has
    any good links for retail graphics especially examples for ice cream I&#39;d be
    very grateful. <BR> <BR>Also what do you think of the name &#34;Milk Bar&#34;
    for a new ice cream parlor? I&#39;ve noticed a lot of them just use a name like
    Ben &amp; Jerrys etc.  How about &#34;Marty&#39;s&#34;? I need something that
    will excite the tastebuds but also not sound lame.

    known character in the film.

  body: Cheryl, it would be nice if it was Marty&#39;s Milk Bar. Put a personality
    behind the business. <BR> <BR>As for retail design, I live in Manhattan and the
    cost of real estate here &#40;even for rent&#41; is prohibitive so a place like
    my local bagel shop is a rediculous layout, super thin but fairly long, you can
    barely get two people to pass one another to get to the end of the counter. So
    their use of graphics is their back wall and a sidewalk sandwich style sign and
    their awning. Thats it! So there aren&#39;t hard fast rules that always work.
    The environment &#40;and money&#41; often will dictate what you can do
