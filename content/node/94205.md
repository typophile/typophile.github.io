  bar in Geneva. The clients absolutely love the solution so now it is a question
  of finalizing. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotype.png ]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/largeview.png|large
  view]]\r\n\r\nRegarding critique we are currently debating about how the space between
  the \"B\" and the \"u\" work; the distance or separation between the \"i\" and the
  \"C\" and also the centralization of the the word Geneve. \r\n\r\nAttached can also
  be found an image to display how the dot of the \"i\" will be used in packaging
  (yet to be finalized) as the sealing sticker.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/context.png

  body: Ci seems begging to be connected. Maybe even a ligature with the dot of the
    /i/. Top left of the B feels awkward. The iC spacing feels too tight, but I am
    seeing it more as a wordspace because of the capital C.

    yes agreed on that.\r\n\r\nLuma Vine, this was done very early on in the process
    it always seemed like a large \"a\" and was not ideal legibility. For the \"B\"
    perhaps more curved..\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/largeview2_3799.png|large

  body: ">Andr\xE9, what did you have in mind?\r\n\r\nSince the client: \u201Cabsolutely
    love the solution so now it is a question of finalizing.\u201D I wonder how far
    are you ready to go to do some changes. To my point of view, the B and C don't
    fit together, the kerning has to be review and I will enlarge the \u201Cx\u201D
    height a bit. So far, I see four parts in this logo (B,C, ui and il). I think
    this logo will deserves to be more homogeneous."

    with the \"B\" and allow the tittles (dots of the \"i\"s) to be more special (like
    you seem to want).\r\n\r\nAlso, without the grave accent GENEVE looks cheap.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Agree with @hrant. I would also do something about /C/ and that would probably
    be changing it to make it more in sync with /B/.\r\n\r\nThere's another thing
    here as well. And that's the last /l/ letter. It terminates with a too much upward
    stroke. Either correct /B/ or correct /l/ (which will likely bring the need to
    change others as well). I'd go with the latter. This will also bring the needed
    change to /C/ that I talked about above.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it looks like an everyday
    fashion hi-brand logo. No revolution here."

  body: "To my eye this looks like it\u2019s really wanting to be classy, but doesn\u2019t
    <em>quite</em> succeed yet. So, great if you can do another round of revisions.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition to what has been said: \r\nWhy is the \u201Cu\u201D so very wide? It
    seems to break the strong rythm of the lowercase; does it contribute anything
    that\u2019s needed?\r\n\r\nAnd the shape of the \u201CB\u201D does not work for
    this eye. Looks more like an odd sort of eszett or something. The curves feel
    a bit contrived, with the connected join but large belly and open bottom\u2026
    I\u2019d also try alternate structures both top-left and bottom-left.\r\n\r\nAlso:
    this might be a rendering issue in the image you posted but the GENEVE might benefit
    from some kerning attention and perhaps a bit of positive tracking. \r\nMore importantly
    though I think the typeface in \u201CGeneve\u201D is not an ideal match. It looks
    a little cheap and generic, plus too open/humanist in conjunction with this script
    (compare curves of \u201CG\u201D and \u201CC\u201D). I\u2019d maybe try something
    more geometric (think Gotham or such) or something in the direction of Sackers/Engravers
    Gothic. Or some classy grotesque (Akzidenz?). \r\nBonus if you can get the stroke
    thickness to match the thin strokes of the script."

    a round terminal everywhere rather than a mixture of round and cut one.

    that 'u' was too wide. and that capital B didn't look properly written.\r\nWith
    the second version, the beak on the C, doesn't look like script writing to me.
    \r\nDid you start with a typeface? or was this hand drawn?"
