<p>Thanks for the input before, <a href="http://typophile.com/node/40047">http://typophile.com/node/40047</a>, i thought I&rsquo;d make a new thread to get it noticed.</p>
<p>I have modified it and I would like to know what you all think. Legibility and the &lsquo;colour&rsquo; are of importance, I don&rsquo;t want some looking too dark.</p>
<p>There will be no lowercase as this typeface is intended for use on the back of football shirts.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Tom</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just took a gander at the previous post, there are definitely some very nice improvements with this set.</p>
<p>Are you planning to keep all the fonts the same weight or do a bolder version also?
I&rsquo;d be interested to see what the LJ combination looks like now with the tighter spacing.</p>
<p>Some nit-picky things to consider:
I think the W needs to be slightly wider (maybe 1.5 times the width of the X) and the M strokes seem thin compared to the N (consider pulling the inside points down to thicken the M a little more). At least from a distance the M needs to be meatier.</p>
<p>You might want to consider closing the bowls of the 6 and 9, or at least one of them. The top tip of the 1 seems slightly over pronounced, could you curl it back like the U? The 8 seems squooshed on the bottom (is it as long as the 0?). Finally, the 4 still seems narrow, it&rsquo;s definitely the curve of the stroke. Have you consider opening the top more, like this: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rehvonwald/361027843/">http://flickr.com/photos/rehvonwald/361027843/</a></p>
<p>There are my opinions, take them for what their worth. Either way, you have a nice looking font on your hands and will look awesome on a jersey. I love that R! This font definitely has character.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Right, thanks for the advice, I have altered it, check out the new file - untitled-5!</p>
<p>The LJ combination doesn&rsquo;t look very good, especially since its got the U following it too! This could cause problems, any ideas?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to leave the K hanging below the cap line, I think it looks more balanced.</p>
<p>How does the 4 and 8 look now?</p>
<p>Also, I thought it best to keep the 6 and 9 as they are, but the 6 is beginning to bug me so I may close it up.</p>
<p>Apart from that I&rsquo;m very happy with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tom: I started a new thread only to attach my suggestions PDF, I&rsquo;m not attempting to hijack your font or anything alike that.</p>
<p>And I mean no disrespect to your lovely letters, I just thought it be easier to illustrate my suggestions by modifying your existing PDF letters. I made adjustments to the L,J,1,4 and 6. Take them with a grain of salt. The spacing isn&rsquo;t adjusted properly to reflect my changes.</p>
<p>While making these changes I realized that the LJ combo might actually be First Initial Last Name. In which there would should be more space between the LJ, which would break up the forming &ldquo;U&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t think of any other times LJ are side by side that you might encounter, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>I hope you find my suggestions helpful. This is really turning into a nice font.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions, the LJ combination is in fact actually the beginning of a last name, it is Swedish.</p>
<p>The L you have drawn is pretty similar to the L I had originally designed, before I decided to alter most of the characters to make it more south Asian. You can see it here&hellip; <a href="http://typophile.com/node/39440">http://typophile.com/node/39440</a>.</p>
<p>That a good suggestion for the 6, I&rsquo;d feel like a cheat if I used that now!</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just going to keep the L and J as they are.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh I didn&rsquo;t see that post. Interesting.</p>
<p>And remember: Good designers borrow, Great designers steal! Feel free to steal any of my suggestions/ideas. Ultimately you&rsquo;ll be the one getting all the credit, I&rsquo;ll be happy to know I&rsquo;ve helped even if in a small capacity.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t try a combination of my J with your L, give that one a gander and see if that might sway you more. Anything to help break up that &ldquo;U&rdquo; that&rsquo;s forming. I actually felt kinda bad straightening your L out, the curves in your letters make the font unique. Straightening the L just made it seem less unique.</p>
<p>What about the 1 and 4? I didn&rsquo;t do much with the 4, just extended it slightly more to the left, so the entire shape was maintained. The 1 however, I mimicked the curve of the U more.</p>
<p>I know you weren&rsquo;t planning to do any lowercase, but how bout punctuation? I&rsquo;d like to see what you do with the @, ?, and &amp; symbols.</p>

<p>I think Andrew&rsquo;s suggestions for 1 and 4 are necessary improvements. I would also suggest lengthening the top of the 7. You should want to avoid 1/7 confusion by all means possible.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think you&rsquo;re done. Good show!</p>
