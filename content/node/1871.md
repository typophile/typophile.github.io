body: I found myself without any sensible work yesterday, so I decided to draw a quick
  sans-serif in Photoshop... <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1950.gif"
  ALT="sans-serif"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure about the relationship ascender and
  cap height... Is it okey, or do I need to increase the cap height &#40;I would like
  to stay away from decreasing the ascenders, tried it already and it looked odd&#41;?
  <BR> <BR>Comments welcome.

  body: ' Hey, pretty nice. <BR>I love the vertical proportions as they are &#40;even
    the longish descenders&#41;. Very clean, and the caps seem to work very well in
    running text. For some reason it reminds me of Koch, or one of Hoefler&#39;s recent
    designs - I think the Gugenheim one. It has this quaint &#40;but nonetheless Euro-rigid&#41;
    air about it. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Thanks. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know about the &#34;y&#34; now that I look
    at it, it looks sort of strange.  <BR> <BR>As for the ascender height, I really
    don&#39;t have a problem with it, it just looks a bit funny when it&#39;s an uppercase
    character followed by an ascending lowercase &#40;&#34;The&#34; for instance&#41;.
    <BR>&#34;Jumped&#34; looks much better for some odd reason...  <BR> <BR>Oh well.  <BR>
    <BR>Hmmm, Looked around for the design mentioned -  couldn&#39;t find anything.  <BR>
    <BR>Care to share a link or something? '

    ALT="sansie"> <BR> <BR>I had some more spare time today, so I gave the international

    regular one&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;m aiming for a slightly more complete

    the left over e &#40;maybe also over a&#41; and the acute one pixel to the right

    over E one pixel to the right. ;&#41; '

  body: Hrant, yeah I know you&#39;re a non-latin guy, but you replied before... <IMG
    SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>As
    for the tildes, yeah, they were too big... I actually noticed that myself. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re any better now though, they feel too small...
    But It&#39;s either this or the previous. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments Hrant

    didn&#39;t seem totally off. I changed the lowercase though. '

  body: Richard -- <BR> <BR>The best resource I know about for the design of the thorns
    is <A HREF="http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.1a/2.1.1.thorn.and.eth.htm" TARGET="_blank">
    Gunnlauger SE Briem&#39;s pages</A>. <BR> <BR>I would suggest making the descender
    and ascender of your lc thorn equal at 3 px. I think the cap Thorn should have
    a larger bowl; try 3x3 or 3x4 for the counter, but keep the 2 px extenders. This
    will push it up into the accent region a little, but I don&#39;t think that will
    be a problem. <BR> <BR>Mind you, I&#39;m not Icelandic. Perhaps someone who is
    can offer better solutions. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: Great resource, thanks for that one. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve updated it... and I&#39;m
    beginning to think I&#39;ve got the &#34;important&#34; characters done... <BR>
    <BR>If I&#39;m missing anything crucial, please tell me. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2084.gif"
    ALT="sans.gif"> <BR> <BR>any comments appreciated of course. <BR> <BR>I was thinkning
    about an italic for this one, but not necessarily a slanted one. I was thinkning
    of a slightly rounded version with connections between the letters, like in a
    script typeface... good or bad idea?

  body: ' I don&#39;t think upright italics work, especially in a coarse medium like
    the screen. On the other hand, slant looks like crap on-screen, which is why I
    recommend using a darker &#40;or lighter&#41; weight - and that goes together
    with my recommendation of using 2-pixel-stem fonts as the text weight. <BR> <BR>hhp '
