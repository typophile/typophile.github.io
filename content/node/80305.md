body: "I'm aware of foundries that have sued customers who are covered by a EULA (for
  instance, the customer who buys a single-user license but then installs it on 100
  machines).\r\n\r\nAre there any known instances of a font foundry suing an <strong>unlicensed</strong>
  infringer, i.e. someone who was never covered by the EULA?"

  body: I don't know about actually suing, but there are a few foundries, including
    Emigre, that have sent invoices and collection agencies to designers who used
    fonts without buying a license.

    send out an invoice for an unlicensed use. '
