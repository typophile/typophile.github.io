  body: I post it here after search it on my fonts directory then myfonts.com & then
    dafont.com also. Its allways easy to find yourself instead of post it on the net.
    This is the my last option i use to find the font.

    to define your type ID request as clearly as possible. For example \xBB1960\u2019s
    newspaper headline face\xAB or \xBBLost in Translation movie logo\xAB or \xBBretro
    script\xAB will do nicely. Whereas \xBBPlease help me identify this font\xAB is
    pretty pointless as that\u2019s the only thing we do on the Type Identification
