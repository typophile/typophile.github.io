  of which I remade the logo. I used Sansa for the name but I don\u2019t want to use
  it for the text font. Which font would match Sansa, serif as sans serif?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/sansa_family/|Sansa]]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: One way to determine appropriate pairs of typefaces is to compare the structure
    of each font. If they share a similar structure than the odds are that they will
    work very effectively together. I have found this to be a great methodology as
    opposed to personal aesthetic.
