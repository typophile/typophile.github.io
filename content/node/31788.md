    is a wonderful exaggeration of egyptian forms."

    amazing! I am not a big fan of Flash these days, but you can tell a lot of thought
    went into the process.\r\n\r\n/OT"

    It has a killer Flash-based Content Management System. It rawks. :^)

    them! \r\nBut, besides the Flash-based Content Management these websites - OurType,
    and FontShop BNLx  (yours, Yves ? :-)) - are the result of a collaboration between
    2 teams: the clients and g94.\r\nIn the case of both websites, there were clear
    demands and expectations regarding site's functions, and a starting point regarding
    the graphics (certainly in the case of OurType)."

  body: "> <em>FontShop BNLx (yours, Yves ? :-))</em>\r\n\r\nWell, smartypants, Rudy
    had it specially designed and built for little ol' me, and I'm the only one writing
    for it, often slaving away till 2-3 am (I have to wake up at 7 am to bring my
    kids to school and go to work). So Corina, please forgive me if I take the liberty
    of calling it \"mine\", even though that obviously is poetic license. I really
    don't think anyone believes I own FontShop. :^P"

  body: "OK T Bones, sorry for this little diversion. Here's some more suggestions:\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FB.106472.0.0\">Dispatch</a> and
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=GF.118888.0.0\">Freight Micro</a>
    are very nice, somewhat more angular alternatives.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=M.230.0.0\">Monotype
    Ionic</a>, when used big, has a similar appearance to Clarendon Light, but with
    slightly more stress (looks more handmade).\r\n\r\nAnd I've always liked the generous
    width of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=UR.110085.0.0\">Volta</a>."
