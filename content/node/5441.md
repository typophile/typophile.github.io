body: I have a picture of a lamp which I wish to cut out and place on a flat coloured
  background. I have cut the lamp out in photoshop and wish import the picture into
  InDesign to place on the coloured background. Clipping paths do not give me the
  result I want because the path is vector based I think and the feathering is lost.
  This also seems to be the case when I create an alpha channel of the lamp. <BR>My
  question really is, is it possible to cut out an image and then place it over another
  background in InDesign or should I just place it over the colour in Photoshop &#40;creating
  a much bigger image&#41; and then import the lamp all ready on the background into
  InDesign.  <BR> <BR>I would just prefer to be able to do it in InDesign. Is there
  a way of importing feathered alpha channels and paths into InDesign or quark for
  that matter? Or when I see examples of such an image is it all created in photoshop?
  <BR> <BR>Thank you for any help. <BR> <BR>

  body: I thought Indy allowed importing of files in native Photoshop format -- transparency,
    spot colors, etc. Wasn&#39;t that one of the original draws over Quark, the seamless
    integration of Adobe apps?

    out&#34; the image: is Photoshop&#39;s checkered background visible in the &#34;cut
    out&#34; areas? If it is, save the file as a Photoshop &#40;.psd&#41; file. When
    you place the .psd file in InDesign, your feathered edges will be visible, and
    you&#39;ll have the soft transition between photo and background that you&#39;re
    looking for.'

  body: What&#39;s the best way to do that in Quark 4? <BR>No rants please, just the
    facts. I am already a convert.

  body: You put a flat background in your Photoshop file, giving it the exact same
    CMYK value as the flat background in Quark.  <BR> <BR>That way, the two instances
    of the same composite color will merge seamlessly in final output -- although
    a difference may be apparent on screen and in some low-res proofs. <BR> <BR>&#40;This
    is a primitive technique from the early days of desktop, before Photoshop had
    layers, even, when minimizing file size was crucial.&#41;
