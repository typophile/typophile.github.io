  I was wondering if any of you out there could help start me off with some ideas
  for typefaces that say 'New York, New York', maybe some fonts designed by New York
  based typographers.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

    Tobais Frere-Jones, a New Yorker, might work well. It is familiar not only to
    those who have been in New York''s Grand Central Station, but also from the Superman
    movie.  '

  body: "The New Yorker font.\r\n\r\nThe real font is called Irvin after Rea Irvin,
    the original New Yorker art director. The main difference between the fonts like
    FF New Yorker, Manhattan, and Upper West Side, which are all Irvin look-alikes,
    is the Q....  Manhattan is from Franklin Type Founders (at Precision Type) and
    Upper West Side from Intecsas (also at Precision Type). \r\n--Mike Yanega, http://typophile.com/node/3728\r\n\r\n
    Foxtrot Medium is another look-alike. The text font used in the New Yorker is
    Adobe Caslon."
