  and had become difficult to follow, so I hope no one minds if I make a new thread
  as continuation of the old one.\r\n\r\nI'm still searching and experimenting, but
  have decided to use Futura as typeface for name and website.\r\n\r\nI'd like opinions
  on this idea. I'm still experimenting with mark - type fitting, but I've included
  one version I like thus far:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/koncept6_4656.gif]"

    it wide, short and oval, it could convey \"eye\".\r\n\r\nBTW, instead of tired
    old Futura you might try Penumbra.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Is the mark a combination of "Z" and "G"? If yes, make it more obvious by
    simply following hrant's advice. Make it wide, short and oval will not only help
    the mark communicating "eye" but also make the "G" easier to grasp.

  body: "I've given up on aspiration that mark should convey photography, because
    bunch of successful photographers logo's don't. If it could, it would be great,
    but I'm not forcing it to, if for nothing else then for the fact I might end up
    doing more than just photography. Instead I'd like some, preferably simple, combination
    (merger) of letters z and g.\r\n\r\nHere are some combos from zg letters. Any
    constructive input appreciated, especially which idea, if any, should be further
    explored:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/koncept-7_3465.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks!"
