body: 'While I was compiling the linguistic kerning pair data, I realized that it
  might also be useful &#40;in fact probably more so, when you think about it&#41;
  to have <i>adjacency</i> data - to see what letters are likely to be on the left
  and right of a given letter. This can help not only in optimizing spacing &#40;and
  kerning&#41;, but also in designing the letterforms themselves, for example by allowing
  fine-tuning of the whitespace relationships between/within the glyph bodies. As
  in the kerning data, this is based on an English corpus, so it&#39;s largely &#40;but
  not entirely&#41; limited to optimizing English setting. <BR> <BR>&#40;109K&#41;

  <BR> <BR>Notes: <BR>1&#41; For each letter &#40;center column&#41;, on each side
  are the letters most likely to occur in decreasing frequency away from the center.
  The spaces separate frequency groups, while beyond the dash it&#39;s pretty slim
  pickings in terms of frequency. The asterisk on a side of a letter indicates that
  that row is 1/10 less frequent than the overall table norm&#42;. As a reference,
  the most two frequent adjacencies are &#34;th&#34; and &#34;he&#34;, both at above
  100K instances&#42;&#42;, then it drops to about 50K &#40;for &#34;an&#34; and &#34;in&#34;&#41;,
  and the rest is mostly bunched up. <BR>2&#41; I used UC letters ro avoid apparent-leading
  issues - obviously lc is the real name of the game. <BR>3&#41; Sorry it&#39;s so
  ugly... <BR> <BR>&#42; So for example you can tell that b, p and v occur mostly
  as initial letters. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; The corpus has about 4.5 million pairs.

  body: "H\xE9ctor: You cut off mid-sentence, what were you trying to say?*\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I've been thinking about this lately, I'm glad the link came up for this old thread.\u2020
    Working on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/91381\">Alpine</a>, I thought it
    would be useful to make some dummy text. <a href=\"http://www.adhesiontext.com/\">Adhesion
    Text</a> works well enough for this,  but 1: I'd like to be able to generate dummy
    text offline, and 2: I was thinking about some other ways of actually generating
    the text.\r\n\r\nA good start is to make pairs of all letters in a list, but it's
    a little unrealistic. Many of the combinations will probably never happen. Linux
    usually comes with dictionary files for spell checking\u2021. I could make a script
    to catch each combination.\r\n\r\nIn line with this thread, with a little modification
    the same script could count the occurrences. The data could be used in the same
    way as the information in your pdf. A count of pairs in a dictionary wouldn't
    really tell you about actually usage\u2014the same script could also count the
    pairs in books from several periods, and work for other languages.\r\n\r\nIs there
    any more information on this? I've tried googling but wasn't <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency\">able</a>
    <a href=\"http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=85\">to</a> <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/31506\">find</a>
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/10879\">much</a>. Most of it relates directly
    to kerning, although it is slightly related. pp 204-205 of the Elements of Typographic
    Style displays part of what appears to be a very excellent test file. I wonder
    if the rest is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Of course, I'm asking 8 years late.\r\n\u2020
    Is it bad to revive an old thread?\r\n\u2021 they are slightly inadequate for
    spelling in that many words are missing, for instance those with prefixes or suffixes

  body: "To me there's nothing better than reviving an old thread. Recently we revived
    one that was about 10 years old!\r\n\r\nThe Brown corpus must be available online.
    It's a bit long-in-tooth, but it's very large, so it still gets respect. That
    said I for one would love to hear of alternatives, especially for non-Latin scripts.\r\n\r\nAbout
    H\xE9ctor's post: during one of Typophile's past system-transitions something
    went wrong, possibly having to do with how upper-ASCII(?) characters are handled,
    and some posts just get truncated. I don't know whether the text data is actually
    gone, or it's there but isn't being rendered.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a thesis on the topic of type design for spanish under the assumption that there
    could be specific language characteristics such as letter pair frequency that
    could be used for practical benefits.\r\n\r\nWell, the topic was too much. It
    ended just in a simple sketch of thesis.\r\n\r\nI remember I concluded that the
    details could be irrelevant for readability improvement but that there were enough
    aesthetic opportunities in the design of diacritics, punctuation marks and ligatures."

  body: Right. Those aesthetic opportunities are what I'm interested in. But I do
    think legibility can be improved slightly by taking a look at letter pairs that
    actually happen. At least, in that one can solve problems of collisions, which
    could be distracting. In a way that too is aesthetic. But readability is at least
    a little bit aesthetic.
