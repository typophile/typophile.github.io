    all the crap on top instead of on the actual \"shelves\"."

    on my experience, that could be said of almost any and every bookshelf in the
    market."

  body: It's obviously not intended as a practical bookcase. It's a novelty / home
    decor item.

  body: "what's up with the weird division of letters too. why do o, p, q, and r,
    s, t, have their own lines.\r\nwould've looked much nicer without that awkward
    block of white (red?) space there."

  body: I suspect that space is for pinning up a poster, perhaps showing a picture
    of the spines of all the books that could've fitted there, had there been regular
    shelves, in a sort of trompe l'oeil stylee?
