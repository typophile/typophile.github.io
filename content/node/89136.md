  body: "As Jan said, the first approach is <strong>ITC Franklin Gothic LT Demi</strong>
    for \"CARERS\" and <strong>ITC Franklin Gothic Book</strong> for \"RIGHTS DAY\"\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/franklin-gothic/\r\nIt's
    an almost perfect match except of the little inclination on capital /C ends.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want a better match for /C you can try <strong>Moby Dick 10 Bold</strong>
    for \"CARERS\" and <strong>Moby Dick 12</strong> for \"RIGHTS DAY\"\r\n(Cambridge
    Fontworks)\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong> I see there is at least one cut of
    Franklin Gothic having the correct /C, so there is no need to look for a different
    font."
