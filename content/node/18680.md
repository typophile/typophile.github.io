  body: "Hi\r\n-\r\nRather than starting a new thread I thought I would outline my
    issue here. I think I have a similar problems to Juergen with distortions. I have
    read this forum and the FL post above and i think my issue is to do with rounding
    intergers as outlined there but am not sure. I am attempting to make a typeface
    made of dots (that shows faces) similar in style to flek/plek. \r\n\r\nExample:
    http://www.bbsaunders.com/ftp/ego1.jpg\r\n\r\nAll the faces are rendered in Illustrator
    then I am importing them into FontLab. This is where the issue starts, the circles
    are distorted in the import. I have tried a copy/paste and import from Illustrator
    and Freehand. Also tried Illustrator 8 file.\r\n\r\nExample: http://www.bbsaunders.com/ftp/ego2.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    can't draw them in fontlab as they are rendered and not hand drawn. Are there
    any solutions to this issue?\r\nI am importing the glyphs at 400pt, if I chose
    another size might this help?\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback or help.\r\n-\r\nJames\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Andreas: Thanks for the quick and detailed response. I was only planning
    26 uppercase charecters so hopefully this may eliviate the crashes. I will also
    try a version with less dots as well. I guess like all things throwing yourself
    in at the deep end is the best way to learn and test the limitations of what you
    can and can't do.\r\n"

  body: "Todays font technology is not suited to handle such a massive amount of paths.
    It will slow down every font rendering engine and will turn into mysterious software
    crashes.\r\n\r\nI would limit the amount of points to 1000 per glyph. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n1000
    points = 250 dots = 15x16 dot matrix (15x16 pixel source bitmap graphic)\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you can shift this value a bit.\r\n\r\nB.\r\n1200 points = 300 dots = 15x20 dot
    matrix (15x20 pixel source bitmap graphic)\r\n\r\nTo get more resolution in FontLab
    you should use an other font UPM size (usualy 1000em). Try 4000,6000 - maximum
    is round about 16000 or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn other trick is to use more glyph cells
    for one illustration. So you can enlarge the grid. On example A, two glyphs give
    you a dot grid of 30x16 (2x(15x16)).\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"

  body: "When Andreas says \"1000 points per glyph\", he means \"1000 point coordinates\".
    Point coordinates in outline fonts must be integer, i.e. you can place a point
    at the coordinate (150,20) or (151,20), but not anywhere in-between. In other
    words, outline points are always placed on an invisible grid. \r\n\r\nThe UPM
    (units per em) size in Font Info controls the \"fineness\" of this grid. By default,
    you get 1000 grid units per glyph, but you can increase it to 2000, 3000, 4000
    or even (max.) 16,000 grid units per glyph. \r\n\r\nHowever, PostScript Type 1
    fonts or OpenType PS fonts cannot have the UPM size larger than 4000 (effectively),
    while TrueType fonts can go up to 16,000. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab

  body: "Gradiate, \r\n\r\ngiven the limitations described above, a suitable solution
    for you, of course, would be to use a rendering algorithm that creates circles
    that snap to those UPM units perfectly. Since 1 UPM unit in the font corresponds
    to 1 PostScript point in Illustrator/EPS, the halftoning algorithm that you're
    using should only render the circles so that they're 2, 4 6, 8, 10 etc. points
    wide (in diameter) and their centers should sit exactly on integer coordinates
    as well. \r\n\r\nA."
