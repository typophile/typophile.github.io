  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Ok, so I got my local ex-letterpress guy  <BR>( he now die-cuts ) to let me poke around  <BR>his warehouse at a date of my choosing. <BR> <BR>In the corner of this rather large space under  <BR>a layer of dust and dust bunnies there is  <BR>a linotype machine, several letterpress machines, <BR> wood and metal fonts and two or three cases  <BR>of block plates of logos, dingbats, flurons,  <BR>boarders, monograms and who knows what else. <BR> <BR>Now, while all of this stuff seems a treasure  <BR>to me, it is the block plates that are  <BR>of particular interest to me now. When I had  <BR>the chance about three months ago to dip  <BR>my fingers into case one, in was obvious  <BR>that many of these were twenty, thirty and  <BR>even forty and fifty years old. When he bought  <BR>the place many of these blocks came with it.  <BR>My estimate is that there are between 300 and  <BR>900 of these total. <BR> <BR>This is my objective. To bring a stamp pad,  <BR>plenty of paper and when I get there, stamp  <BR>away. He has agreed to let me do this. <BR> <BR>So I am wondering if anyone has had any  <BR>experience in archiving this kind of thing and  <BR>if any advice, before I head in, could be  <BR>offered. I don't expect to make my trip for at  <BR>least another week. <BR> <BR>Paper choice is a major concern. And since I <BR>have no blocks to experiment with myself in  <BR>the meanwhile is a simple ink pad going to  <BR>work well enough? <BR> <BR>-smc</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sean: From my limited experience in making block prints without a letterpress, I think that results from a stamp pad are going to disappoint you. You might be better of picking up a pound of <a href="http://www.graphicchemical.net/block.html" target="_blank">black relief ink</a> and a <a href="http://www.graphicchemical.net/brayers.html" target="_blank">brayer</a>. The ink'll be tackier and, I think, give you a better impression.  <BR> <BR>Try placing the block face up, rolling out a thin layer of ink on a peice of plexiglass or lexan, inking up the block, placing the paper on top of it, and burnishing it with the back of a wooden spoon (er, make-shift baren). It's the white trash way of ancient Japanese woodblock printing.  <BR> <BR>You could also try using a &quot;galley&quot; or &quot;proof&quot; press if there's one laying around the shop.  <BR> <BR>Good luck. <BR> <BR>Nathan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant's definitely right that galley proofs aren't worth a heck of a lot. For that matter, my trailer-park-Hokusai method isn't going to be absolutely stellar. If you're planning on archiving these things <a href="http://www.oneart.com/cgi-bin/briarpress/showcuts.cgi?uid=default&amp;home=1" target="_blank">digitally</a> though - i.e., if you just want something to trace a vector image of - I think that either one would be OK. If you really want to archive them on paper though, you might want to fire up a small platen press if there's one available. If you're not that familiar with letterpress, I think it'd be easier to get decent prints off a platen (e.g., C&amp;P) than a flatbed (e.g., Vandercook).  <BR> <BR>Nate</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. Inking up, printing, and cleaning hundreds of blocks would definitely take an inordinate amount of time. The advantage of a proof press is that it's pretty simple. Just a flat bed that your galley (or block in this case) sits on, and 2 rollers that you pull over the paper. Essentially like block printing but with rollers instead of a baren. Faster than a hand baren, but with uglier results.  <BR> <BR>To be honest, if you're not looking for top quality prints, learning how to lock up a few blocks at a time in an old platen press wouldn't be too hard. It's pretty easy to pull a print - pretty darn hard to pull a good one. I'm no Gerald Lange, but if you're interested I could email you some pointers.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, below is a pretty standard proofing press. Simple little beast, innit. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7785.jpg" alt="proofpress"></div>

Proofing presses, traditionally, are used for pulling proofs of &quot;galleys.&quot; A galley is a tray that a typeset page would sit in, after being composed, before being printed. So the proof, like Hrant said, is just for layout/proofreading.  <BR> <BR>Cylinder presses are the real deal. I've got a &quot;platen press&quot; (see pic below) that I think would be easier to get the hang of for a beginner than a cylinder, although rumor has it that they don't produce the same quality.  <BR> <BR>I'll try to throw a simple How To sort of thing together for you. It won't make you a great printer, but hopefully it'll help you lock up and print those blocks.

		<div class="commentbody">smc <BR> <BR>Sounds like a project. I'd say Nathan has guided you well here. The best blocks to reproduce would be any with a copper face. These would be older than zinc or magnesium faced blocks and would repro much better as their detail is much finer. Rubber stamping won't do unless you are just using it for identification purposes. The use of a traditional hand buren is difficult and the spoon technique is probably worse than rubberstamping.  <BR> <BR>The galley proof press could work well if you are somewhat skilled with a brayer. A lot of these galley proofers are Vandercooks (Model O). But they are not the sophisiticated models that come with registration and inking mechanisms.  <BR> <BR>Best would be a Vandercook equipped with these (any of the Universal or SP models are the top of the line), as these were specifically designed for exacting reproduction work. At the end of the commercial letterpress era, these were used by type shops to repro metal type for the photo offset folks. We did a lot of repros for folks intent on digitizing these faces at one time. We even did a couple of repros for Doyald Young's first book. <BR> <BR>Most likely, in that shop you are messing around in there is a platen jobber, as in Nathan's last photo. (Nice looking press by the way.) This would do the job as well, but the reproduction quality would not be near what you could get with a properly adjusted Vandercook repro press. The platen jobbers are quite beatific to work on but I think it a bit easier to learn on a Vandercook as the makeready and inking concerns are less formidable to a beginner. The Vandercook is also better for bookwork, if for no other reason than it has a relatively massive bed size. <BR> <BR>Best to take a workshop on letterpress before you engage in this project. The blocks themselves are becoming quite valuable, especially the copper faced. A search for letterpress items over at eBay would give you an idea of their relative value. <BR> <BR>FYI: I've got a group site on contemporary letterpress practices at <BR> <BR><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress" target="_blank"><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress</a></a> <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange <BR>The Bieler Press  <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sean: you live in New Mexico? I'm actually flying to San Diego in a week and a half to visit a friend of mine. Forgive my ignorance of the southwestern geography, but if it's not too far to travel, perhaps we could meet up somewhere. Nonetheless, I'll start putting my &quot;intro&quot; together this weekend and email it to you as soon as possible. <BR> <BR>Nice website BTW. I like the printers marks. Funny to see them in Internet Explorer.</div>
