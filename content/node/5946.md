body: All Central and Eastern European languages use letters with diacritical marks.
  These characters are not included in standard western fonts. To write texts in those
  languages you need special CE fonts or fonts with expanded character set &#40;as
  Adobe Pro fonts&#41;. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately many western typographers are not experienced
  in designing Czech or Polish characters and many foreign CE fonts are not suitable
  for correct typesetting at all. Bad accents are usually too small or huge, too close
  to the letter, incorrectly shaped etc.  <BR> <BR>For the next issue of <b>TYPO Magazine</b>
  &#40;<a href="http://www.magtypo.cz" target="_blank">http://www.magtypo.cz</a>&#41;
  we plan to publish an extensive overview of Central European diacritics &#40;historical
  background, design hints etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>Dear members of this forum, could you
  please send me <b>samples of correct diacritical marks</b> for your mother tongue?
  Send me either just font and foundry names or samples &#40;PDF preferred&#41; with
  letters and accents. Sample attached. Every participant will be credited in TYPO
  Magazine.  <BR> <BR>The result of this research will be published in TYPO Mag in
  September and then on a special website on CE accents. <BR> <BR>Thank you <BR> <BR>Filip

  body: Filip, <BR>I was going to send you my font but since I am an American, I would
    not be qualified to determine if my diacritics were correct for Eastern European
    languages. May I send you a PDF just to get your opinion and perhaps some advice
    on how to improve it for Eastern European languages?  <BR> <BR>Thank you, <BR>
