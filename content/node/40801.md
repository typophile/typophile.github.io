  real </em> answer, but I am hoping someone can give me some thoughts, good ideas
  about this one. My client asked for a typeface that is \"hollywood 40s\". She also
  used the words \"retro\" and \"streamlined\". Any one have any good thoughts for
  typefaces under this description?\r\n\r\nThanks much in advance..."

    might be about right.

    sharing -- what a beautiful typeface!\r\n\r\nB"

    Solano</a>? Too far in the other direction? What is this to be used for? Text?
    Packaging? Display? '

  body: oooh, thats nice too. this is a website. the logo has been done in a serif
    caps  and she wants a tagline to offset it. i think Solano might be too heavy.
    Sorry, I am so wasting your time and you are being so helpful -- but you are introducing
    a young designer to some beautiful typefaces!

  body: This is how I keep limber. No worries. Can you show us the logo or tell us
    the typeface that was used? Was Solano right if it weren't too heavy?

    cards, credits and sho-cards. What kind of material does this need to go with\u2014does
    it need to evoke epic films, propaganda films, noir? Or just the immaculately
    dressed stars in fitted clothes side of Hollywood?"

  body: Linotype Metro is actually of that period, and was widely used. In 40s movies,
    when they zoom in on a newspaper gossip column, you would see Metro in use right
    on screen. Or, Mostra Bold looks just like hand-lettered block displays on movie
    posters.

  body: Technically Metro was released in 1928. :^P But, yes, by the time all the
    newspapers and advertisers got their hot little hands on it making it ubiquitous
    it might be considered a face of the 40s (more likely the 30s).

    target=new>Meyer Two</a>. However, this is technically '20s Hollywood, not '40s.
    Plus it might clash with your existing serif. Still . . .\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
