<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Now that [[TypeCon]] is over, it's probably a good time to start thinking about the next type conference, <a href=http://www.atypi.org/06_Lisbon>ATypI 2006 in Lisbon</a>. So, I've decided to put together a few links and start a wiki entry about [[Lisbon]], which I hope will serve as a sneak preview and a teaser for the many things one can do while attending the conference. The intention was also to provide some visual insights of the Portuguese culture. Enjoy!
[Edit:]
Here's the frame of mind you should be on ;^)

<div class=commentbody>When ATypI comes to its senses and schedules it's conferece at a time of the year when those of us who teach can get away I will happily attend. Taking a trip at the 2nd or 3rd week of the semester is not an option.

TypeCon must have left everyone flat, judging that the post-conference chat is so quiet. Perhaps it was all that Dwiggins attendees are still trying to digest.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The timing of ATypi conferences is perfect for European educators, whose semesters usually start not long after the beginning of October. Having just been to a type conference always pumps me up for a fresh start. When it takes place in Europe, this time of year would seem to make sense, since I assume more Europeans than Americans, Africans or Asians come. As John Hudson mentions, the majority seems to prefer this time of year. Still, I think it's useful to keep asking, since demographic waves have a habit of changing direction.

<div class=commentbody>James, the question of the timing of the ATypI conference is one that gets raised repeatedly within the organisation, and to date despite the fact that some people lament the late September dates that always turns out to be the time that the majority of people say they prefer. I'm sensitive to the question of the conference dates relative to academic schedules because, as I wrote in the recent member newsletter, educators are an increasinly important constituency within ATypI (as seen in the extension of the Education Forum to a full afternoon in the Lisbon programme). Obviously different countries and different insitutions have different schedules, since we regularly get both teachers and students from e.g. Reading, but I'd like to get a better picture of the kind of schedules people have, and to know what conference dates might work better for them. When would you be most like to be able to attend ATypI, James?
We'll never make everyone happy, of course. I can almost never attend TypeCon because summer is family time (although being in Seattle next year makes it much more likely that I'll be able to attend, to which I'm looking forward very much).</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, I appreciate that different countries have different academic schedules and calenders. I would be most likely to attend an ATypI if it were held in late May or anytime in June, since my spring semester finishes mid-May. Anytime during the month of January would also be possible (Between Fall and Spring semesters), but I would think the weather may be an issue with some folks.
Late October would also be a possibility, as would mid March. These times would fall in the middle of the semester. With classes well under way it would be easier to miss a class without losing too much momentum.

<div class=commentbody>May might be difficult for some Europeans; TYPO-Berlin, which is Europe's largest graphic design conference (I think) is usually the middle weekend in May. It has always seemed to me that a sizable group of designers who attend the ATypI conference also attend TYPO-Berlin.
Personally, I'm not sure that there is any time of year that is good for everone. The ATypI conference seems to be geared toward European schedules, but this year's date cannot be good for European professors or students, can it? Don't the winter semesters in several countries begin just before, or the day after, this year's ATypI?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Regardless of venue, the Americans make up the majority of attendees to all ATypI conferences. Because of this fact, several years ago, ATypI was entertaining the notion of holding the conference in North America, every other year. This has not come to pass.

Some conferences provide answers so well, the only possible post-activity is getting to work. I’m already looking at...you’ll see.
T: "Well, the date change is only a secret wish, not a need on my part."
It is for a lot people, though never will it be realized in ATypI, who's "Dates" were originally perfect for middle-aged and older design, management and marketing types who's children, crops and livestock were tended by devoted servants and services whilst the masters frolicked.

ATypI dates used to work better for me as my school was on a later schedule, but now we're in line with other U.S. schools so it's inconvenient but not impossible. A week or two later would work better. Due to other travel and events, fall is the only time available for me.

<div class=commentbody><em>Regardless of venue, the Americans make up the majority of attendees to all ATypI conferences. Because of this fact, several years ago, ATypI was entertaining the notion of holding the conference in North America, every other year.</em>
The stated policy beginning in the mid-90s was to try to have a North American conference one in four years. But this reflected the North American <em>membership</em> levels, not the North American conference attendance. I'm afraid your comment about Americans being 'the majority of attendees to all ATypI conferences' isn't true, James. As representatives from a single nation, they are often the largest group, but they are not the majority overall. Furthermore, and problematically for ATypI, our conferences in North America are never as well attended as our conferences in Europe. San Francisco in 1994 was a small conference. Vancouver in 2003 had only 260 attendees including speakers (against an average of 350-400 attendees at European conferences in recent years). My memory of Boston in 1999 was that it was larger than San Francisco or Vancouver, but perhaps that was in part due to the relative proximity to Europe. In North America, there is much more competition from other design conferences and recently from Typecon. At the Prague ATypI, some of our board members met with SOTA board members to discuss this, and from our perspective the question is very much 'How best can ATypI continue to mount events in North America?' i.e. it is very much something that we want to do. We're overdue for a North American conferences, and although we have not confirmed the location yet, I'm pretty confident that you can expect one in the near future. I'm very willing to look at the dates for such a conference in the context of what will work best for the majority of our members from the Americas.</div>

Where is everyone going to stay? When are you arriving and leaving?
I'm staying at <a href=http://www.residencialflorescente.com target=_blank>Residencial Florescente</a>, arriving on Sunday, Sep. 24, and leaving on Monday, Oct. 2.
Miguel, what do you suggest for people who, like me, only have a couple of free days before or after the conference? With so many options, one needs to prioritize. Of course it's all a matter of personal taste etc, but it'd be interesting to hear how <em>you</em> would spend two or three days in Lisbon as a tourist.</div>

<div class=commentbody>David: <em>It is for a lot people, though never will it be realized in ATypI...</em>
Once again, the ATypI board frequently raises this question with members, and the response has regularly been that although no one date pleases everyone the majority of people who respond end up saying that September is as good a time as any and better than most. This was the result of the last formal survey, and has also been the result of every informal discussion on the member email list. And here we are revisiting this question again, and here I am as vice-president of ATypI suggesting that I want to review the dates in terms of the increasing importance of the educational constituency within ATypI (but acknowledging, as Jay notes, the difference between North American and European academic schedules). So I think there is a very good chance of a generally preferred date being realised in ATypI, if such a preference actually exists.
When would you like the ATypI conference to be, David?
<em>Someday, Somecon will recognize the plain and simple fact that 90% of the industry resides in the northern hemisphere.</em>
I don't understand the significance of this observation. It's not like the ATypI conference is dependent on the late summer harvest or other seasonal occurence. Can you explain?</div>

<strong>First day</strong>, Lisbon
In addition to the classics, <a href=http://www.ippar.pt/english/patrimonio/mundial/jeronimos.html>Monastery of the Jerónimos and Tower of Belém</a>, I'd walk around <a href=http://typophile.com/wiki/Lisbon#downtown>downtown</a> and the <a href=http://typophile.com/wiki/Lisbon#neighborhoods>old neighborhoods</a>, always trying to avoid the big malls and stores that you can find anywhere in the world.

I'd also visit the new part of the city, <a href=http://typophile.com/wiki/Lisbon#expo>Parque das Nações</a>, which was refurbished from top to bottom to held <a href=http://www.parquedasnacoes.pt/en/expo98/>Expo 98</a>.
<strong>Second day</strong>, Sintra (20Km West of Lisbon)
Take the commute train and get off at the end of the line; if you took <a href="http://www.cp.pt/cp/displayPage.do?vgnextoid=87cbd5abe2a74010VgnVCM1000007b01a8c0RCRD&lang=en">the right train</a>, you'll be in <a href=http://typophile.com/wiki/Lisbon#sintra>Sintra</a>. (You'll also notice the difference in the air's quality, and its humidity :^). This is definitely a <em>must see</em>!! The Cultural Landscape of Sintra was classified as <a href=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/723>World Heritage</a> by Unesco in 1995. There you can visit the <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/50512811>old Villa</a>, the <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/16017832>Palácio da Vila</a> (right downtown), the <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/15798003>Mourish Castle</a>, the <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/53521500>Palácio da Pena</a>, and the <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/29244272>Quinta da Regaleira</a>, which holds many secrets of <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/29243767>Masonic and Templar rituals</a>. Along the way you'll find other places of interest, like the <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/17058170>City Hall</a>, and the <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/image/17058179>Moorish Fountain</a>, for example.
<strong>Third day</strong>
If you feel adventurous enough, hop on a train heading North (start from <a href=http://www.parquedasnacoes.pt/en/comochegar/Default.asp>Oriente Station</a>), and visit <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/tomar>Tomar</a> (another <a href=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/tomar.html>World Heritage site</a>), <a href="http://www.santuario-fatima.pt/portal/index.php?lang=EN">Fátima's Sanctuary</a>, <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/coimbra>Coimbra</a>, or <a href=http://www.pbase.com/diasdosreis/porto_e_o_douro>Oporto</a>. Portugal is a fairly small country, so a train ride to Oporto (the most Northern city I mentioned) would take only about 3 hours.</div>

<div class=commentbody>More on attendance by nationality:
I don't have analysis of past conferences handy, but Ross made a tally of the current registrations for the Lisbon conference. Of course, these numbers are expected to change, but I don't think they will alter so radically as to make Americans the majority. As of today, delegates from the US account for 16.45% of registered attendees. Europeans currently account for a little more than 60% of registered attendees, which is in line with my impression of recent conferences. The Russians are currently in the lead at 17.11%.
On the other hands, the great majority of ATypI's sponsorship comes from US-based companies, albeit mainly from ones with very significant international presence.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John: "...Boston in 1999 was [] larger than San Francisco or Vancouver, but perhaps that was in part due to the relative proximity to Europe"
Sure Boston is closer to Europe, than say Wichita...but it was bigger than S.F. 'n Vanc. because the content was geared to a wider audience, not because it was easy to get to. Only 5% of the content was technical (and that was solid stuff as opposed to "whatever" over and over again ;) ), we loaded up on internationally respected graphic designers and other proven practicers of our art and got graphic designers to come.
John: "We’re overdue for a North American conferences, and although we have not confirmed the location yet..."
How much would it cost to sponsor the whole thing to ensure entirely unsponsored content? Let me know.
>90% of the industry resides in the northern hemisphere
John: "I don’t understand the significance of this observation"
The earth, is round, and it tilts on its axis seasonally. During the summer months, it's warm and pleasant in the N. hemisphere, and cold and often unpleasant in the winter time. Enough?
John: "When would you like the ATypI conference to be, David?"
Jan or Feb., in Cancun.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>How much would it cost to sponsor the whole thing to ensure entirely unsponsored content?</em>
Are we talking about the conference programme or the pre-conference TypeTech Forum content? The former is largely the result of submissions made to an open call for papers, voted on by a programme committee that doesn't involve any sponsors and is largely established before sponsorship commitments are made. So I'm not sure how it would be different if you set out to 'ensure entirely unsponsored content', unless you prohibited the programme committee from selecting presentations submitted by individuals who work for companies that might possibly sponsor the conference.
The TypeTech Forum programme is compiled by a team of volunteers, who at the moment happen to be Tiffandy Wardle, Tom Phinney and Si Daniels because they're the people who offered to do it. Ross and I used to do it, but gave it up in 2003 because we were too busy with the rest of the Vancouver conference. I'd be happy to see the programme be more 'independent' and driven by font developers rather than software developers, but that means someone getting involved at that level. Must be willing to work with others.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Some conferences provide answers so well,
> the only possible post-activity is getting to work.
While other conferences do this by providing <cite>questions</cite>. :-)
Different people get motivated by one or the other to different degrees. After ATypI-Leipzig I started on Nour&Patria, while at TypeCon-SF I found myself spending too much time attending the tea & muffin programming track... :-/ personally I get tired of "Hey look at this cool poster I made" <cite>real</cite> quick-like.
> 90% of the industry resides in the northern hemisphere.
But where is 90% of the future coming from?
> From what I understand, when the conference was held in Lyon, there were suprisingly few French atendees.
> our conferences in North America are never as well attended as our conferences in Europe.
I think these go to show that a big reason many people go to ATypI (and TypeCon, although I suspect to a lesser extent) is the adjunct tourism! Hence the fact that "Jan or Feb., in Cancun." is only <cite>partly</cite> a joke... well, I assume! :-)
> We’re overdue for a North American conference
?
You might be miffing a certain country with this apparent exclusion... :->

<div class=commentbody>The ATypI Lisbon 2006 conference organizers have just published the conference program brochure and the TypeTech Forum program leaflet on the web. The two PDF files are available for download at:
http://www.atypi.org/06_Lisbon/30_program/20_main_program
Of course, all TypeTech forum and all conference participants will receive the printed versions in Lisbon, but you may want to download the files now for reference.
Best,
