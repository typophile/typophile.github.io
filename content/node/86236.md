body: "This is a bit of an odd question. Several years ago I made a font based on
  some sketches made while looking at blueprints at the Canadian Center for Architecture.
  They were early 20th century, but I don't have a year, and do not have any other
  information about those blueprints. Now I'm looking for a way to keyword and describe
  this font and am a bit at a loss as to how to describe it. It seems to have influences
  from Art Deco and the Arts & Crafts movement, but wonder if there is any more exact
  terms/description I can use? \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pixilate.com/images/66.png\"

    if there is a more descriptive term for this type of lettering. '

  body: "I'm sure there is, but I'd say you'd play the game by their rules. If you
    can only choose from two or three so-so decriptions, but your font sells better
    having it listed _their_ way, it is what it is. I don't think 'blueprint' will
    be listen as a category...\r\n\r\nIf you would be able to indicate a time period
    on these sites, 'Jugendstil', 'Art Nouveau', 'Berlage' or 'Amsterdam School' comes
    to mind. But having a closer look -again- at your font (k, n, s, K, N 1, etc)
    I'd say yours is a bit less 'static'."
