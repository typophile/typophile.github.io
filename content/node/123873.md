body: "I am trying to find a new type combination for a well established company...
  A font pairing that is a new style, yet won't go out of style in a few years or
  look too trendy. Even an old trusted font that is making a comeback? Was thinking
  of using Gotham for headlines, Baskerville or Archer Pro for subheads and Gotham
  Narrow for body copy....but then it just seems like Gotham is overused and everywhere
  these days. What's something comparable, has same impact as Gotham but not everywhere
  you look?! And a nice complimentary font to it?\r\n\r\nSoooo...What are your top
  three favorite font pairings that are tried and true, your go to fonts that you're
  using right now??? Go! \r\n"

  body: Yes, I feel Archer Pro is overused as well.... It's amazing when you start
    investigating typefaces for a new identity, you start "seeing" the fonts you like
    everywhere!!! So, please...any new or favorite font combination suggestions....greatly
    appreciated!!!! (This is for a well-known food company....mostly for their internal
    communications.)
