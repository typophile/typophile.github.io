  with the Proofs that exist of it. I was curious if anyone has ever tried finishing
  the face (adjusting the italic and tackling the bold)? I believe Tracy was right
  in saying \"the thought has much to recommend it.\"\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: I did some work with 267D a couple years ago -- gathered sources, did some
    research, laid a little foundation -- but put the project aside before getting
    around to digitizing anything, and I haven't had a chance to pick it back up.
