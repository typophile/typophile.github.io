  body: "For me it was David Carson's \"End of Print\" - which is pretty crazy considering
    it's not that great of a design book, it doesn't teach design principles, and
    it was \"designed\" by a fairly self-centered \"designer\" which shows throughout
    the work. \r\n\r\nBut somehow it triggered my path into the design world..."

  body: I'd probably have to say Alan Fletcher's "The Art of Looking Sideways". Though
    it could be considered a published scrapbook, featuring both his own work and
    others, there are so many things in there that have changed the way I see or think
    about things.

    much more from Richard Eckersley and Rich Hendel.

    on Design\" (the precursor to \u2019A designer\u2019s Art\u2019)--also, Ruder's
    \"Typographie\"and El Lissitzsky's \"About 2\".\r\n\r\nToday, half a century  later,
    I would agree with James Montalbano and say Frutiger's  \"Complete Works\" is

  body: "This is a hard one; there are so many candidates. I'd probably give the nod
    to two: <em>Jan Tschichold: typographer</em> by Ruari McLean, and <em>The Design
    of Books</em> by Adrian Wilson. I never met either Tschichold or Wilson (I never
    met McLean either, but I spoke with him on the phone), but they had an enormous
    influence on my design aesthetic. And, through Adrian Wilson's book, I was also
    strongly influenced by Jack Stauffacher, although I didn't really know where the
    influence came from until I met Jack some years later. All of these typographers
    were concerned with readable text, and with effective design that aided the reader,
    not the ego of the designer. (Jack Stauffacher still is, I'm happy to say.) Trendy
    books are useless. Actually, they're more than useless: they're often pernicious.
    Though as Ben McElroy (<em>bemerx25</em>) points out, even those can serve as
    the spur to get us interested.\r\n\r\n"
