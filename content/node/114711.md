  and am looking for some help. My thesis is about pairing typefaces and helping novice
  design students create successful typeface pairs with guidance from expert designers.
  I would love your input on what your favorite typeface pairs are and why. Any input
  would be greatly appreciated! \r\n\r\nThanks much in advance. "
