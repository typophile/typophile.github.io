  to share on a server so different computers could use it at once. \r\n\r\nI hope
  you guys have some good idea's\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!!\r\n\r\nEddy"

  body: The three primary font server management tools are, [[http://www.fontexplorerx.com/|FontExplorer
    X Pro]] from Linotype/Monotype, [[http://www.extensis.com/en/font-management/universal-type-server-3/|Universal
    Type Server]] from Extensis and [[http://www.insidersoftware.com/FA_pro_server.php|Font
    Agent Pro]] from Insider. All are capable of the functionality you require but
    vary in terms of additional technical and typographic features.

    have also used Extensis Suitcase, but due to some kind of bug it crashes every
    time I try to open it."
