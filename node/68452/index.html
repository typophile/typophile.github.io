  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Given that the moderators of this group are not actually empowered to have people like &ldquo;Mbtshoes&rdquo; drawn and quartered, I&rsquo;d like to suggest that it might be a good idea to make it slightly more difficult to register a typophile account in an effort to cut down on such rudeness. I have virtually no knowledge of designing web sites, so I don&rsquo;t know whether any of these suggestions are actually feasible without dumping a huge amount of work on someone.</p>
<p>A couple of ways to do this might include:</p>
<p>(A) A short time-delay between the creation of an account and gaining posting privileges (say a couple of hours which might be sufficient to encourage spammers to go elsewhere).</p>
<p>(B) Some sort of rather trivial quiz to demonstrate an actual interest in type (I&rsquo;m thinking along the lines of a series of multiple choice questions with answers easily tracked down on the typowiki, e.g. &lsquo;An example of a neoclassical design would be (a) Bembo, (b) Charlotte Sans, (c) Bell, (d) Avant Garde Gothic&rsquo;, (e) Fette Fraktur).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know if others agree whether such a step would be desirable.</p>

no offense taken. I’m with you, spamming should be made as difficult as possible. However, your suggestion A would render the Type ID Board (the most popular Typophile Forum, by far) useless. With B, we would exclude all those students and newbies who come here to learn, and who represent the bigger part of the community. Remember that “<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/66583#comment-391165">Typophile was started as a student project.</a>”

<p>So yes, administrators <em>can</em> be there 24/7. <em>You</em> don’t have to be.</p>
<p>Also, as mathowie explained on the Pipeline podcast, the admin tools they’ve built enable all admins to glance at such tools five minutes out of every hour to keep on top of what’s going on. This site is in denial of several facts (it has problems, it can be improved, it has admins not moderators), but in this context being in denial of the fact that all this has been handled well elsewhere before means that <em>nothing ever changes</em>. “This job is so hard and we can’t work 24/7!” is not an argument when there are proven methods to reduce the workload and provide round-the-clock administration.</p>
<p>Now some asshole’s gonna chime in with a personal insult, if history is any guide. Nobody here likes to be reminded that Typophile has problems that are solvable.</p>

<p>Seems that most Spam these days is coming from newly created blogs. One option would be to moderate all new first-time blog posts. Not sure how doable that&rsquo;d be.</p>
<p>As for the trolls, it&rsquo;s not that bad on Typophile compared to most online forums. At least the trolls we do have have some character.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>With the recent addition of Florian (in Europe) and me (in the U.S. Eastern time zone) as Admins, due to the last round of complaints about lingering spam, I think we’ve been doing a better job of cleaning up around here lately.</p>
<p>Most of the spam bots tend to attack in the overnight hours (relative to the western hemisphere), and I think we usually come along and clean up most within about three hours.</p>
<p>Now, that may not be quick enough to prevent some folks from being annoyed (I can’t blame them), depending upon what hours one keeps. But I think things have improved.</p>
<p>The janitorial service that Florian and I perform is the kind of thankless job that goes unnoticed when it’s under control. Most have no idea what we’re already managing to handle.</p>
<p>So, while the situation can still stand much more improvement, I take some small offense to the <em>“nothing ever changes”</em> over-generalization.</p>
<p>That’s not to say Florian and I wouldn’t love to see more impediments in place to begin with. We’ve been making suggestions to the Punchcut site owners.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggested, though, that the questions should be chosen so the answer would be easily obtainable from the wiki (and the prelude to the questions could state this explicitly). My goal was not to weed out those who didn&rsquo;t know the answers to specific questions, but rather to weed out those who aren&rsquo;t sufficiently interested in the topic to do a couple of minutes of research (something which a bot probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do).</p>

When I do see spam, I just report it using the &ldquo;Feedback&rdquo; link at the bottom of every page. Any spam I have reported gets removed quickly so somebody back there (whatever their title is) is doing the job quickly and quietly.
