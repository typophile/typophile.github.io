		<div class="commentbody">Nathan, I'm not a native but I read and speak a little Thai. <BR> <BR>So far, what you have is pretty neat, and I think it's great to see westerners working on Thai fonts.  I'd like to do a few myself.  Here are a few comments: <BR> <BR>Serifs: Thai, of course, has those little circles (I don't know the correct term) that begin the stroke, and are important in distinguishing letters.  I think your typeface would benefit from indicating these with a more noticeable serif where they should be. <BR> <BR>The Bangkok Bank's logotype (<a href="http://www.bbl.co.th/Bangkok%2BBank/Main.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.bbl.co.th/Bangkok&amp;#43;Bank/Main.htm">http://www.bbl.co.th/Bangkok&amp;#43;Bank/Main.htm</a></a>) has a similar face, but theirs could use a small boost in legibility too, I think. <BR> <BR>? &amp; ? (kho rakhang &amp; kho khuat): I think you're going to have to emphasize the upper-left part of these letters more.  Give them more room, and the less you use the half-width strokes, the better, in my opinion. <BR> <BR>? &amp; ? (do dek &amp; to tao): I think the &quot;inner stems&quot; of these letters actually need to extend inside the letters' counters more, and the left side should &quot;bubble out&quot; more if possible. <BR> <BR>Some of these suggestions may apply to other letters too.  Good work!  I'd like to see more. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the suggestions, Paul. I've been tweaking kho rakhang et al - trying to extend those strokes without creating enough space under them to graze herds of sheep. I'm sure there's a happy median somewhere. And, the more I look at it, I think you're right about the half-width strokes. They get pretty annoying. Once I get some revisions done this weekend, I'll throw up another image. BTW, I really like that no nu in Bangkok Bank. <BR> <BR>Part of the impetus for starting work on Thai fonts is due to a friend of mine from Bangkok who was lamenting the dearth of good Thai language fonts. Both &quot;modernist&quot; display varieties (he's of the opinion that Thailand missed out on modernism almost entirely and went straight to glorious <a href="http://www.thomasriddle.net/high-on-chatuchak/pages/elephant800.htm" target="_blank"> post-modernity</a>) - and also decent bilingual faces. That is, other than Angsana and Cordia and whatever other crap comes bundled in Windows. In fact, what he wants is something along the lines of what you posted Hrant. Something without all the &quot;curlicues.&quot; So I've also been working on another face (which I'll post sometime soon) that's supposed to work with Univers.  <BR> <BR>And if you're interested Paul, there are some good online <a href="http://seasrc.th.net/paper/paper.htm" target="_blank"> papers</a> about Thai characters by a computational linguist working at CRCL Bangkok. <BR> <BR>Thanks again guys. <BR> <BR>Nate <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, when I was in Thailand I saw quite a bit of &quot;Latinization&quot; - ranging anywhere from a scary Thai version of Westminster to some pretty nice modern typography. E.g., the Futura-looking labels on the phone booths in Chiang Mai. I wonder if that's mostly due to the monstrous sweep of the West into Asia, or if it might just be the evolution of their script. After all, English has come a long way from Lombardic script and blackletter.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, somewhere in vast expanse of cyberspace, there's a 14MB .pdf file of a 400 page book (in Thai) that, I believe, is a treatise of some sort on Thai letter design. The last 250 pages are a huge collection of specimens of available Thai faces. For the life of me, I can't find the link to it, but if anyone's interested, I could burn a CD of it and toss it in the mail. <BR> <BR>And I'll post another file soon of the revisions to this face. <BR> <BR>Cheers.</div>

A writing system is an extremely powerful piece of cultural identity, and a homogenous gray world seems deathly boring, no? <BR> <BR>On the other hand, it's a complex issue: there are certainly some good reasons to bring &quot;modernism&quot; to different parts of the world - it's enriching. But it does have to be done sensitively: in the sample I showed (the bottom line), the results are both overly harmful to Thai culture <i>and</i> dysfunctional as well: when a person who reads both Thai and some Latinate language sees that thing, it's just confusing. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Wow, that PDF you describe sound like a dream&hellip; <BR>Why don't you just put it up on some site for us to download?

		<div class="commentbody">i briefly looked at the two versions while i was at work, <BR>and i noticed a couple of things. one was that i have no <BR>idea what any of it was. i think that may have been a <BR>good thing, since i couldn't trick myself into knowing <BR>what a shape  was without actually knowing. the only <BR>specific forms i remember were the two that i posted, <BR>one from the original, one from the revision. i can't <BR>remember which one was which. the shape on the  <BR>left in the images is more legible (i think. remember, <BR>i don't know what it's &quot;supposed&quot; to look like) because <BR>of the more pronounced indent of the leg. there were <BR>a few others that were similar, but i didn't have time <BR>to look at them today. press day and all. so there's my two bits, <BR>and mr. matteson knows how much that's actually worth. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4976.gif" alt="nates1"> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4977.gif" alt="nates2">    <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4978.gif" alt="nates3"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">zoinks. i can barely tell the difference between ru, tho thung, ko kai, kho khai, and kho khuat, at least from the unicode link i was looking at. this bitmap idea of yours is more challenging than i thought. apparently how the glyphs are read depends not so much on the mark but on where the mark is placed inside (or outside) of a certain shape, or even the length of a stem, kind of like we can tell the difference between a lowercase l and a lowercase i without a dot. at least i think this is what's going on. so, the difference between ko kai and tho thung doesn't need to be exaggerated. the question is whether a thai speaker would recognize a crooked leg or a nick out of the leg more easily. on screen at small sizes, the crooked leg jumps out more, but will it be recognized? any way, i'm starting to confuse myself.  <BR>  <BR>as for our conversation the other day, well, anyone reading bitmapped thai text on their pda most likely isn't concerned with the cultural authenticity of the thing. imagine everyone in deutschland reading books that look like they came straight off of gutenberg's press, or romans carrying books made of stone with words chiseled into them. i'm not promoting global homogeneity, but everything has to evolve. the curlycues being replaced by dashes or whatever seems like the equivalent of serif vs. sans. we all know f is f. the evolution of thai faces may be more modernization than latinization. we aren't trapped in world of handwriting, neither should they be, so bravo on your efforts. i hope they like it chiang mai.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">SWFs do not post as easily as GIFs. More, if you translate *.unk into *.swf's, they are not replicated at original size, but at some browser-mazimizing size, destroying pixel lock. an associated HTML file helps, a GIF screen dump helps more. Not to say Flash compatibility is unimportant to prove - it's huge. Only, get Unicode compatible ASAP. <BR>The unk/swf showed me a clear Thai on the grid, making me think of futurist Thai space travel, starring stars I have never seen.**I only know Thai from my local restaurants (in San Francisco, that is a reasonable taste). <BR>Nathan, if you'd like to publish this font or a greyscale adaptation, please let me know. My eye cannot tell if it's been Latinized but I assume the damage is minimal.</div>
