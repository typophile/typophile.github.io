  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m on an AIGA Center For Sustainable Design (CFSD) committee so have become conscious of my consumption and waste.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/BottleBeutyShotCropped_6226.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I drink a lot of water, travel a lot and spend a lot of time in New Orleans where the water is of dubious potability.  We have excellent well water at home so all I needed was something in which to carry it. I researched plastics of all kind and got real scared by most of them.  I found a perfect and beautiful stainless steel canteen bought by the U.S. Army but it retails to civilians for $90.00.  Plus, the washer on the plug was made from one of those plastics I didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I noticed a glass, wine-size beer bottle with a re-usable stopper in our cupboard, someone had give us a holiday gift of fragrant viniger in it the year before.  So, I started to haul it around.  But the exposed glass frightened me and I wanted it protect.</p>
<p>We recycle those those nasty little shopping bags and had collected many.<img src="/images/old-images/Re-purpose_Bottle001B_4065.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It dawned on me that I could make an insulating bottle container of my own:</p>

<p>All you need is the bags, a pair of scissors, a large crochet hook ($0.95) and time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>dear htking,</p>
<p>thank you for the glass water bottle link, i couldn&rsquo;t find anything like this when i looked a year ago, maybe these products, of the site, are new?</p>
<p>hi guerilla,</p>
<p>i made this chunky on purpose so it would insulate the bottle from breaking.  someone had already mentioned that my idea was not original, probably my over active imagination and photographic memory picked-up something like this and just tucked it away.</p>
<p>i work with such extreme refinement in my professional life that it is a pleasure to make something as crude as this bottle cover.  besides, you can more easily see some of the original graphics when the pieces are big.</p>

<p>Also—on this sustainability line of thought—we&rsquo;re working on a new entry level engraved monogram and note card line.  The packaging for it pictured below</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Collegiate_Packaging_4_6246.B.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>is made from cover stock that was donated to AIGA New Orleans (NOLA) after the storms of 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  This cover stock was amongst the supplies that came down in the MBulance, which was just part of the design aid relief efforts nation-wide.  In addition to computers, software, books/magazines and much needed art supplies, we received 4 cartons of Fibermark &ldquo;Jersey Plate&rdquo; in navy, each carton weighs 160 pounds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28614">http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28614</a></p>
<p>One carton went to AIGA NOLA and was used for program covers for the first big fund raiser here after the storms.  One carton was donated to Loyola University New Orleans and part of it was made into hand silk screened posters for the first annual New Orleans Green Salon.</p>

<p>This is now an annual event where we partner with the city, Tulane/LSU AgCenter/UNO and about a dozen non-profits here interested in re-building New Orleans with sustainable practices.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s event was webcast LIVE and was the first such event presented &ldquo;virtually&rdquo; and in real time.  AIGA New Orleans is a pretty small chapter but we get a lot done.  There are between 40 and 60 professional members, only, and between 200 and 300 student members.  Which is why we are so supportive of our student typographic and design communities.</p>
