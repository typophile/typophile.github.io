  body: The ZUMWALT part is almost identical with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/thincompressed/">Interstate
    Thin Compressed</a> but Tobias Frere-Jones wasn't born 1924... ;-)

  body: you're right... the crossbar on the A is a little lower in my sample, but
    it's pretty close! thanks.  any ideas on the second line? i love the "P".

  body: It wouldn't take much manipulation to get <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/hamptons/light/">Hampton
    Light</a> to fit, and it similarly doesn't fit the timeframe....  :-)

    (for years) and i admire it every time.

  body: I would guess this is not any particular typeface. Most architectural lettering
    of that era was created by signmakers, not type designers.

  body: not a particular face -- i agree. especially in case of 20's signmakers. although
    marten did find a VERY close correlation for the main. but now, i'm wondering
    if there's anything pretty close to the secondary line.

  body: meh. "company" loses some of its charm in titling gothic; you should start
    with this and tweak away (especially that P). if that seems to laborious, this
    can't be too difficult to make from scratch in AI.
