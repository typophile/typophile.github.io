    often referred to as an 'infant' or 'ball and stick' a. It is often used in texts
    for children as it falls in line with the requirements of educational institutions
    or bodies, though I am not aware of any specific standards that require it. The
    best argument I have heard for using it (as a straightforward replacement) is
    that it looks more familiar to children who have been learning to write, e.g.,\r\n\r\nhttp://www.handwritingforkids.com/handwrite/manuscript/animation/lowercase.htm\r\n\r\nThat
    said, my son has no problem with the more traditional /a (and /g) which is used
    (with greater frequency) in his favourite story books.\r\n\r\nIf you want to seek
    out other examples, searching for infant and ball and stick might help."

    that's the best argument (such as it is). But as children who have been learning
    to write generally already know how to read, and have been exposed to both forms
    of the \"a\" the argument does not make much sense, except in the limited case
    that the typeface is intended as a model for writing.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty
    of reasons to believe that the two story \"a\" is usually preferable for legibility,
    and what little research has been done says that beginning readers prefer it anyway

    had a significant impact on children's reading performance, but the single- versus
    double-storey /a/ and /g/ didn't make a difference. The children understood from
    an early stage that we use different forms in reading (typefaces) and writing.\r\n\r\n<a

    Immersive reading isn't about taking seconds to consciously decipher individual

    a small letter alpha, anyway. You can do that with all the Roboto fonts from thin
    to black, condensed or not. If you are not too fancy, there is not much else to
    do (but the aogonek will come out quite wrong)."
