This is what I will be using as my main example for experiment on the thread about <a href="http://typophile.com/node/91109">Multiple &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; of one typeface</a>. The initial idea for this came from some vague Xavier Dupré inspiration, although that&rsquo;s not very evident here,  and sketching. In fact, I&rsquo;d like to get a somewhat organic and &ldquo;drawn&rdquo; feeling.</p>
<p>I vaguely had in my head something of &ldquo;classic&rdquo; printing types also, likes ones in books I own printed 1970 and earlier. Like Baskerville, Kis, Dante, Caledonia, Sabon, Fournier, Electra, and Times. Although the digital versions of these just don&rsquo;t look like they do in old books; they are much lighter and crisper. Alpine likely does not very much resemble any of those, as I haven&rsquo;t looked at them much during my process. (Except to read my old books!)</p>

<p>Note:
I&rsquo;ve decided, at least for now, the name will be Hemlock. Hemlock is the state tree of Pennsylvania, where I was born.</p>

<a href="http://21326.info/work/alpine/Alpine-20120401.png">Larger image</a>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another update. I&rsquo;ve tried to fix most of the things you guys have mentioned. I&rsquo;m also experimenting with wedge baseline serifs for the &rsquo;d' and &lsquo;u&rsquo;, is it working? I hope I&rsquo;m not being to radical with some of the uppercase. I&rsquo;m going to have to work on the &lsquo;R&rsquo; for sure.</p>
<p>I decided to remove most inside serifs in an attempt to improve <em>notan</em> aspects. I was originally thinking removing the bottom left serifs would improve it. It <em>does</em> make an interesting interlocking pattern, but it doesn&rsquo;t help the word image at all, in my opinion.</p>
<img src="http://21326.info/work/alpine/bouma.jpg" />
<img src="http://21326.info/work/alpine/notan-counters.png" />
<p>Of course, it really looks unusual. I think it would probably trip me up in running text. Also, the counters don&rsquo;t really <em>look</em> like anything. In a way it&rsquo;s visually messy. I had thought about this, and as I said, I decided that I should remove the inside facing serifs.</p>
<img src="http://21326.info/work/alpine/notan-counters2.png" />
<p>I realized it would be excellent for two reasons: 1) this helps reinforce the relation ship between letters, which is what <em>word image</em> is all about. 2) the counter form actually <em>looks</em> like a simplified &lsquo;n&rsquo;. Other similar letters will do the same. So except in the case where the serif is needed for color or helps make it &ldquo;work&rdquo; better, I&rsquo;ll be removing inner serifs. The serifs also seem to create a fairly even, rhythmic line, except where the counters are opened up. I think this also helps recognition of letterforms.</p>
<p>I had been thinking of this before the thread came up, about emphasizing the most important parts in the recognition of glyphs. <a href="http://typophile.com/node/91645">http://typophile.com/node/91645</a> The research of Frederic Gosselin is fascinating, although I think it&rsquo;s fairly obvious to most of us here. For one thing, from the outset I made a large hood on the &lsquo;f&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m thinking I may try reworking the &lsquo;a&rsquo; based on that research as well.</p>
<p><b>On the Hebrew:</b> Trying and get a handle on the relative proportions for everything as early as possible. If able, I want to make the Hebrew and Latin share any vertical metrics they can, however not much works there. Maybe I can relate the flag of the <em>lamed</em> to the Latin accents. This current Hebrew might be too playful to really work in text, as well, but I&rsquo;m working on it. I&rsquo;ll be doing print tests as soon as I get enough glyphs finished for it to really mean something. Text at medium-to-small sizes is what I&rsquo;m going for.</p>

<blockquote>Not sure if a /v/ like that works...</blockquote>
I'm not either! Actually, that's the first time I've ever made one like that. Sometimes you just get peculiar ideas about how letters can be built when you've spent too much time playing with them. Thanks for the input btw Jasper.
<blockquote>/a/ needs work.</blockquote>
What exactly do you think the problem is? :)
<p>Also, thanks to Martin Silvertant who gave me some much needed input on <a href="http://fav.me/d4uigkw">dA</a>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Brian, thanks for inviting me to comment on this design.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re doing a number of things right. I like the
narrowness, the vertical proportions, the color and most
of all your lack of fear in terms of not clinging to a tired
black-marking method - you&rsquo;re thinking of what this
needs to be doing, as opposed to where it&rsquo;s supposed to
be coming from.</p>
<p>It is however probably a bit too tight.</p>
<p>I love seeing the black pushed around to allow the white
to sing in unison. As you&rsquo;re seeing it&rsquo;s tricky though. But
don&rsquo;t worry too much about breaking any of the cliché
rules - especially in immesive reading they become really
pointless. Also don&rsquo;t be afraid of being a little Po-Mo; it&rsquo;s
entirely human to be unsure, and type is for humans.</p>
<p>BTW, that large &ldquo;n&rdquo; in your most recent post make me
think you should look at FF Avance. Keep in my though
that Evert was a Modernist.</p>
<p>For the Hebrew, I can only offer tentative observations,
but it does seem to me that it can&rsquo;t fully inherit the Latin&rsquo;s
narrowness. Your vertical proportions seem to make good
sense though.</p>

The name has also now been changed to <em>Hemlock</em>. I like that name better, more about that is at the end of the first post.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes:</strong>
z: it is a bit quirky. I haven&rsquo;t printed my test pages yet so I don&rsquo;t really know how well it will work.
n,m,h: Martin had said on dA that it looks a bit like a man standing with his legs far apart and feet to the sides. I&rsquo;ve found that I think the size of the gap is distracting, so I&rsquo;ve condensed these letters a bit.
caps: I&rsquo;m having a bit of trouble with the proportions right now, so bear with me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make this too old-fashioned, but make a contemporary design with the warmth of old metal book faces. So bear that in mind. Hopefully the spacing is better than before, although I&rsquo;m not at a point where I can start kerning yet.</p>
