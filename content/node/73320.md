  body: '"DANNY KAYE" could be Century as well. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-century/|Font
    Bureau''s version]] looks close enough.'

  body: "This is pre-digital, so any suggestions will likely be close but not exact.\r\n\r\n\"BACKED
    WITH\" appears to be Futura Book (or Light) Italic.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/futura/book-oblique/\r\n\r\n\"DANNY
    KAYE\" is Century Schoolbook Bold Condensed. Bitstream's is good, but the strokes
    are a tiny bit heavier than in this image.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-schoolbook/bold-condensed/\r\n\r\n\"MYTI
    KAYSI\" and \"SONG\"...based on the S and M, I like Railroad Gothic or Gothic
    No. 13. However, Railroad's A has a much thinner crossbar.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/railroad-gothic-rr/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/gothic-13/\r\n\r\n\"DODGERS\"
    appears to be Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Condensed, or one of its derivatives.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/bold-condensed/\r\n\r\nAgree
    that \"Oh, Really?\" is Century Schoolbook Italic.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-schoolbook/italic/\r\n\r\nI
    would hazard a guess that \"R-20,105\" is News Gothic Bold. It could also be Franklin
    Gothic, bue News Gothic's 1 seems to me to be a better match.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-gothic/bold/\r\n\r\n-NJ"
