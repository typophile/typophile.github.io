  is a typeface that I created a couple of months ago.  I wanted to transform each
  letter into 'characters'.\r\n\r\nEach letter is doing an individual activity, that
  you would associate with children, i.e. hop-scotch, hula-hoop.\r\n\r\nThe letters,
  at the moment, are black, but I think that adding a bit of colour would bring each
  personality to life even more!"
