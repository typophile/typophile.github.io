  body: "I would have never guessed that to be an actual typeface. It's obviously
    been extremely man-handled and stretched out of whack. \r\n\r\nJust curious Mike,
    what attracted you to this face? What do you have planned for it?"

  body: "Actually, that's the extra bold weight, and it doesn't look like it's been
    distorted at all, other than spacing. The font is by Michael Neugebauer from 1980-87,
    according to the '98 FontBook.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: IDK Mike, take a look at that "ed" looks kinda [[squooshed]] and stretched
    actually. It's just really mangled next to the Fontshop version.

  body: "Yeah, when I look at them side by side I see what you mean, but it's not
    grossly distorted, just a little wider/flatter. I'm not trying to make an argument,
    my point was just that it's not too different than the font has looked for over
    20 years. \"Really mangled\" is a matter of opinion, for sure.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
