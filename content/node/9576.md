body: 'A newbie here. <BR> <BR>I am wondering if anyone knows the font that is used
  on the awards that are put on movie posters when they are selected or win at a film
  festival.  You know, the little olive branches that surround something like &#34;official
  selection toronto film festival&#34; etc.  &#40;see this URL for a sample: <a href="http://www.betterlucktomorrow.com/"
  target="_blank">http://www.betterlucktomorrow.com/</a>&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also
  wondering if anyone knows where I can find the actual branches that surround the
  text either as clipart or EPS or something. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help, google
  hasn&#39;t done much for me. <BR> <BR>-Taylor'
