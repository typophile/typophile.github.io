		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>my first thought: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Butchers">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Butchers</a>
If I had to guess the target group I’d say splatter film freaks.</p>
<p>It doesn’t say traditional to me but it DOES say unique. In a way.
I guess it could work for a small business, willing to take the risk (of grossing out potential cutomers) in order to (possibly) establish a very unique brand.
A GrindHaus truck driving by is definitely something to stick in one’s brain for quite a while.</p>
<p>For the logo:</p>
<ul>
<li>the grinder looks very industrial to me. Doesn’t work for homemade sausages IMHO</li>
<li>I think a logo like this requires a very careful use of colours. Yellow looks purulent, purple reminds of veins and old meat.</li>
<li>i’d avoid any kind of grunge/worn look. Nobody wants to eat food from a dirty/filthy place.</li>
<li>the G in No. 2 could only work if the ‘RIND HAUS’ was in the same colour as the G (the clamp). Then again, it emphasises the clamp, not the grinder.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think the best way this could work was a reworked clean monochrome version, maybe with rounded edges in order to add a little softness/friendliness/wink. If you use colours, look for ‘butcher-friendly’ colours (with a rather bold logo like this I’d avoid red – green could be a good choice)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Ari</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Without reading the description, I thought this was a logo for a nightclub or a bar.</p>
<p>If I were buying sausage, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to think of how it was made. The name reminds me enough without having to look at an image of a gritty, dirty grinder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest reworking this from the start. What kind of image are you trying to convey for your client? Based on nothing but my own opinions, I&rsquo;d go with a clean, retro 50s look, evoking the friendly neighborhood milkman. Maybe in baby blue, white, and red.</p>
<p>If you want to appeal to the &ldquo;foodie&rdquo; crowd (upper age range of your demographic), maybe focus on the handcrafted aspect of the sausages. <a href="http://www.jbfinecheese.com/index2.html" target="_blank">This</a> is a local cheese shop with a nice clean image that is probably closer to what you want.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I realize that the imagery does not go hand in hand with food in general. But this is really the vision of the clients. I am simply working within the given parameters. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, who&rsquo;s to know if this is the wrong imagery for a sausage shop just because a few people (me included) think it is. The people behind the company have worked in the food industry for a long time, their investors trust them, so I guess I&rsquo;m willing to.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s cool and technically well done&hellip;.however, it reminds me of the gruesome scene in that Pink Floyd video when the children blindly march into a meat grinder. Not exactly the place I&rsquo;d want to eat dinner!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re forced to use a meat grinder, there must be a less-ominous, less violent-looking way to portray it? Maybe even if it were a &ldquo;stainless steel&rdquo; grinder instead of black?</p>
<p>Even so, I might try harder to convince my client that a visual of the grinder itself might not be the most appetizing way of selling sausage. I mean, heck, &ldquo;sausage making&rdquo; is <strong><em>actually the phrase used</em></strong> to describe something revolting! Why would you use a VISUAL of &ldquo;sausage making&rdquo; as a logo? It&rsquo;s a bit like using a photo of a bloody, decapitated pig to sell honey baked ham.</p>
<p>Oh, and I have about 20 years experience in the restaurant industry. Before I went back to college for graphic design, when opening a new restaurant, I hired qualified designers to help craft an effective identity package. Sure, I had ideas based on my restaurant expertise&hellip;.but I knew I didn&rsquo;t have the visual design and marketing skills to excel at logo development. In other words; convince your client to trust you. If you believe a meat grinder logo will hurt their business, tell them! Show them what would reach a broader, more targeted audience. That&rsquo;s what logo development is all about!</p>

<p>I second the not noticing the tag line. As far as the typography, the only thing that I notice is in the perspective version&ndash; the S seems to ascend much more than the others while its baseline stays relatively in keeping with the others.</p>
<p>To my eye that S seems slightly wrong in its perspective.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hey dude, there&rsquo;s small problem i find with the 3/4 view of the grinder.
while much better than the other version the fact that theres so much of an angle means that its hard to see both &lsquo;the&rsquo; and &lsquo;grind&rsquo;
might i suggest making it less acute.. and maybe placing &lsquo;the&rsquo; in more centred on the side of the grinder.
i only say this because when your dealing with walk-in/by clientele you need to be able to immediately communicate how cool you are and what your offering (probably in the other way around..) the extra 2 seconds it takes for people to say &lsquo;oh its grind&rsquo; and the other 2 to notice &lsquo;the&rsquo; could hurt business.. just saying..</p>
<p>i think the concept is really cool, brilliant approach to a fairly original idea. i like the two-color logo on the top right. but i think maybe you should explore blue and red (?) whenever i hear butchers stores i think of red white and blue.. i think this juxtaposed with your logo could work well&hellip; now doubt you&rsquo;ve already tried this..
i think maybe your grinder and the black outline on the text should be of the same darkness.. in my opinion it would give the logo more fluidity..
i hope the business goes well</p>

I&rsquo;d definitely like to try some of their sausages, but they&rsquo;d have to work pretty hard to make them as exciting as the logo. I&rsquo;m into offal and sausages etc, so it would be good if they could make a type of sausage that was hard and dry, not too much fat and definitely no stringy bits - that&rsquo;s if they make cured sausages rather than the fresh stuff.</p>
<p>That said, #4 looks best but I think that the perspective is a little wrong. You have a vanishing point to the left but the word &ldquo;The&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t vanish in the same direction as the words &ldquo;Grind Haus&rdquo;. I think that the design would benefit from drawing some temporary grid lines to position the perspective effect (take out later). You might also have to bend the meat grinder a little to get it completely into the right perspective.</p>
<p>Also the words &ldquo;Los Angeles&rdquo; have some problems: 1. Are not in the same perspective (don&rsquo;t get bigger as they approach the viewer.) 2. Different feeling font 3. Bit hard to read when put over the other font, esp if reproduced in B&amp;W. My suggestion: Use smaller point size of same font as &ldquo;Grind Haus&rdquo;, put it under the word &ldquo;Haus&rdquo;, put it in same perspective as &ldquo;Grind Haus&rdquo;. This will help to reinforce the &ldquo;coming at you&rdquo; feel of the logo.</p>
