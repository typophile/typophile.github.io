body: "Lettering at first was drawn for Miroslav Krleza's book Croatian God Mars -
  it's about WW I and tragedy of life in Croatia. At first it was drawn as a high
  contrast stencil serif display lettering. And then it expanded with more letters
  and then started redrawing to create regular serif, just that it will need some
  contrast re-adjusting to become text typeface. \r\n\r\nStarted as a college(Department
  for the Design of Visual Communications at Arts academy in Split) project with guidance
  of Nikola Djurek (www.typonine.com), and now trying to produce whole set of display
  serif typeface.\r\n\r\n Also started to create wide selection of ligatures and swash
  combinations. \r\n\r\nCurrently all caps, and hope to start digitizing lower case
  drawings.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mars-Ligatures-Alternates_5996.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mars-stencil-ww_4967.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mars-stencil-w_6270.jpg]\r\n"

    a proper look?

  body: Spacing needs some work. Posted a pdf. Please note that everything is still
    in Illustrator and all shapes are not merged so has some quirks.

  body: "Now, that's a tasty stencil.\r\n\r\nThe serifs have issues, though. Some
    of the serifs aren't aligned with the bottom of the stems. The serif of the top
    arm of the K has weird artifacts (and the leg is wobbly). The stem of the B has
    strange artifacts as well. The swash-R leg doesn't connect to the bowl.\r\nIn
    other words, quite a few small inconsistencies. But I like the overall look, it's
    not a style you would expect to be stencilled, which is very nice."
