body: I've collected bunches of dingbat fonts over the years as part of various packages
  and apart from playing with them to see what contents they have, I've never really
  used any of them. Simply put, they're a lot harder to place and work with than vector
  clipart. Does anybody use them in day-to-day design work or are they mainly just
  fun little relics of the metal era?

    text and can be styled liked text. The trouble is of course to access the right
    glyph. But the more recent dingbat fonts have Unicode support and the glyphs can
    easily be accessed through glyph palettes or copied from various sourced and then
    pasted. \r\nWingdings, Webdings and these fonts might be outdated, but on the
    flat icon style is currently very popular \u2013 on the web with fonts like <a
    href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/\">Font Awesome</a> or fonts
    from <a href=\"https://symbolset.com\">Symbolset</a>, and in print with fonts
    like <a href=\"http://www.ffdingbatsfont.com\">FF Dingbats</a>. "

    occasionally. But many dingbat fonts consist of symbols you seldom need. \r\n\r\nI
    don't think they're hard to work with, but generally work best when tiny. If I
    need something bigger I'll use something more detailed."

  body: "I originally made separate ornament fonts for Fontesque, but when FontFont
    upgraded it to OpenType, the ornaments were subsumed (i.e. buried) in the alphanumeric
    fonts.\r\n\r\nOriginally (1993), it was the early days of DTP, and vector art
    was having a heyday, as bitmapped images were much harder to process in the workflow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    there is a similar situation today with regards to emojis\u2014they being the
    an emergent form suited to a new medium (the high-res mobile device).\r\n\r\nEven
    quite recently, there was a vogue for ornament fonts, observable in the MyFonts
    best-seller list. But \uFB02ourishes now seem to have migrated to be included
    in the fonts."
