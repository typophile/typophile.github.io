body: Hello.  I am very new to this.  There is a typeface that is very commonly used
  (or used to be commonly used) in advertising French products, movies etc.  The one
  place where I could readily identify this is on the General Foods International
  Coffee "Cafe Francais!"  It's a rather simple font, but rather rounded and very
  distinctive.  I'm sure that all of you have seen it a number of times.  Can anyone
  tell me what it's called?  Thanks!  Merci!

    body: "Thanks, everyone (david hamuel, pattyfab and suntory):  it is, indeed,
      Peignot!  At least, that is what they USED TO use on the International Coffee
      can; looks like they switched to Perpetua Bold (which, to my eyes, looks much
      less distinctively \"French\" than the Peignot).\r\n\r\nI apologize for not
      providing a sample for everyone.  There is still a lot of stuff that I don't
      know how to do on the Internet.  But I appreciate everyone's willingness to
      help me out, because I have wondered literally for YEARS what that font is called!
      \ Does this website have information on the history of fonts/typefaces, who
      developed them and why?\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I am a complete newcomer
      to all of this (note my confusion over correct use of \"typeface\" vs. \"font\").
      \ But all of you are so nice and helpful that perhaps I missed my true calling
      in life!  :-)\r\n\r\nI see that that Peignot is for sale!  Is that something
      that you purchase and add to your printer or what?  I was a French (and Spanish)
      major back in the day, and I still write stuff in French from time to time.
      \ The first time that I clearly remember Peignot was when we showed the 1960s
      French film \"A Man and a Woman\" and we did the title in Peignot in the advertising,
      but we had absolutely no idea what it was called-- it just looked so French
      to us (and even the name of the style is clearly French)!  :-)\r\n\r\nThanks
      again!\r\n\r\nGeorge"

      forgotten that, but right you are!  (I really didn't watch Mary Tyler Moore
      that much, but I do remember the title design, and the theme song).  That may
      be the most famous of all uses of Peignot, at least for Americans.\r\n\r\n     By
      the way, Peignot has its own entry in Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peignot\r\n\r\nThe
      article states that it's a \"French, Bauhaus-influenced Art Deco typeface.\"
      \ At least I was correct about the French part!  :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nGeorge"
