  events and charities over the next year in the city of Chicago. i was wondering
  what a good typeface might be for use in text passages and also one that would be
  used for headlines or as display in conjunction. Maybe a quick explanation as to
  why for each as well would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nthanks-\r\nw|m"

    Oldstyle</a> or another of Goudy''s faces. His formative years were spent in Chicago,
    he comes from the mid-west, and his typefaces have the warmth and unpretentiousness
    that I associate postively with the midwest (I come from there). Goudy Oldstyle
    will have a reassuring familiary with the generous and caring overtone. '

  body: "Important questions, but I thought Will already answered most of them, or
    implied the answers. The readership of a charitable pamphlet is likely to have
    many people over 50 years old, well off contributors or potential contributors.
    A pamphlet is usually 6 x 9. He implied that there will be some extensive text
    passages. A pamphlet is usually not on coated paper. There will likely be extensive
    lists of names of contributors and sponsors...\r\n\r\nAm I right?   "

  body: "William, pretty much right on.\r\n\r\nThe audience is mostly 40 and up crowd.
    people with money looking to donate and to have a good time at particular charity
    events through the next year.\r\n\r\nthere will be a mix of short and long text
    passages as their will be many columnar listings and a few features or call-outs
    of certain events. \r\n\r\nthe size will be somewhere between the 6x9 to 8x10
    range...(yet to be finalized and decided upon)\r\n\r\nthe paper will most likely
    be matte stock, although this will be running and shipping as an insert to our
    larger and main magazine, they may get a deal on the stock we are currently using.\r\n\r\ntext
    color will be black with a splash or two of accent color that i have yet to decide
    upon\r\n\r\ni like the idea of the Goudy types...warm and unpretentious, and his
    Chicago connections are right on. subtle details for those who care. it's important
    to not make this look too inaccessible to the general public. this insert booklet
    needs to span the bridge between the usual reader of our main magazine and the
    common person who picks it up, not knowing what the main magazine is about (fashion
    and expensive everything).\r\n\r\nw|m"

    the new reworking of Lanston Village, but Font Bureau's version is very nice.
    The display cuts are good to have."
