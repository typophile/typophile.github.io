  seems i don't have it available form the panel.\r\nI see in CS2 (4.0.5) that there
  are a lot more languages and dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nPaolo"

    awry with yours. I''m not sure what would be the best way to fix this: reset preferences?
    reinstall? try asking is Adobe''s InDesign forum?'

  body: "Hyphenation and spelling for Russian is not officially supported in InDesign
    CS, only in CS2 and CS3. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you own Adobe Acrobat 6.0 or newer,
    you can copy all files from <code>C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\Linguistics\\Providers\\Proximity</code>
    (Windows) or <code>Library/Application Support/Adobe/Linguistics/Providers/Proximity</code>
    (Mac OS X) into <code>C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\InDesign\\Plug-Ins\\Dictionaries\\Proximity</code>
    (Windows) or <code>Applications/Adobe InDesign CS/Plug-ins/Dictionaries/Proximity</code>
    (Mac OS X). \r\n\r\nThis way, you'll be able to use spelling and hyphenation in
    Russian, Polish and a few other languages in InDesign CS. \r\n\r\nA."
