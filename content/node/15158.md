body: "To all typophiles,\r\n\r\nWorking on a logo for a ballroom dancer who is branching
  out into private lessons specifically aimed at wedding couples. One of the roughs
  uses a capital K (which signifies the instructor's last initial) and imagery of
  a chandalier and couple dancing:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.designsecretsrevealed.com/images/files/K.jpg\">Ballroom
  Dance Logo Rough</a>\r\n\r\nI think it has potential and would like to further the
  execution. Currently, the K used in the logo is Franklin Gothic Heavy. I like its
  strong presence, but an elegant serified K would be preferred.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know of an elegant serified capital K that has a high arm/leg junction? Stempel
  Garamond Bold is option B right now, but I would prefer an American Type Designer,
  or a nice Humanist face.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. - Aron"

  body: Aron your design with the K will have to be large or the details will be lost.
    I suggest you work at simplifing the mark so it can be uses in smaller sizes.
    Good start

  body: "For a serif face, I might suggest Century Expanded. But frankly, the serifs
    are going to interfere with the reversed imagery. I agree with Dan's comment above-
    the concept is good but the details (particularly in the chandelier) are too intricate.
    SUGGEST the chandelier, simplify the figures...\r\nIt's an interesting idea. I'd
    like to see where you end up."

  body: "Yes, I agree with both comments. The logo has been updated with Century Expanded,
    and the chandalier lost its sparkle (but not entirely simplified). More clean
    up will follow:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.designsecretsrevealed.com/images/files/K2.jpg\">Ballroom
    Dance Logo Rough - Serified</a>\r\n\r\nMy main concern is how the serifs are interacting
    with the reversed imagery. One one hand, Design Theory is telling me that serifs
    add 'elegance' to the mark. But on the other, Real World Experience says that
    they will hinder the legibilty of the mark; the serifs just add conjestion.\r\n\r\nWould
    it be all that important to add typographical sigifigance to the mark by adding
    a serified K rooted in American History? Or should the concept of the mark live
    alone in simpler sans-serif terms?\r\n\r\nThanks again for the insight. - Aron"

  body: "The highest American K junction I can think of is Benguiat, although the
    curved leg might work against your image. On your latest rough I think the dancers
    could move to the right slightly. On the other hand your concerns about the requirement
    for a serif are justified, the image presents all the elegance whereas the letter
    is a strong background, if this works in the context of your overall design I
    would be inclined to stick with sans. Let us see how the final logo looks.\r\nTim"
