#5 the 1&0 is clever, but you'd have to watch that it doesn't read as "loinary"
Letters in #2, 6, and 10 have a very retro ('57 Chevy) kind of feel - is that intended or desirable for your brand?
I think #5 is my favorite, if the above concern could be lessened somehow. </div>

5 seems to be the one, which even at this stage, clearly spells out an idea. The '1' and '0' do read  as 'l' and 'o', but that can quite easily be corrected, I feel.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Too bad Master Card's logo is taken because in some ways that's the obvious solution with a name like that. Which brings me to my 2 cents. All of these logos ideas are okay but are a little too fussy & clever. I say that because the name itself sounds classy & simple. So I would go that way. Think of obvious stuff & find a way to make that it simple & low key. If you really want to go the other way & be very special effect/lucas film-y; why not a binary stars? One red one blue? Then just pick a font and write the name simply underneath. Or do something with the two holes in the upper case B maybe, but keep it understated.

Why this name? What's it mean?

Thanks for showing this to us. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for all the feedback everyone.  I feel that maybe I haven't explored the word color as much as I should.  I am having a tough time coming up with concepts of color that aren't old and used or just to busy (test patterns, color blocks, etc.)  

eliason the '57 Chevy isn't what I was looking for.  I was trying to play with a few scripts just to explore some different typeface options but it doesn't sound like I got the effect I was looking for-a techy, yet artsy typeface.

Sharon the dots are supposed to look like the connector circles on circuit diagrams but the more I look at them the more I believe they should be more subtle.

Eben I really think your on point.  I've played with the binary star concept a lot and have missed the mark.  I would really like something modern and understated.  Maybe I will revisit.  I chose the name for two reasons: (1) Playing off the phrase "Primary" Colors and (2) Adding the Binary to mean digital since all my work is 'digital colors' in essence.</div>

I actually like the idea enough that I would be happy to work on it formally with you. That if you would like the help. If so send me an email.

The only thing I can imagine doing differently now is maybe letting some colors wash through the 01010s. Making the i & l read through the 1 is sooo sweet. It shouldn't work logically & yet it does.

Still, it's hard not to keep digging.

As to the middle line not being needed I guess you could try it without but I think it brings a certain grace. A pause that is probably how the i & l trick works!</div>

Thanks Jarrod. As Eben says, dropping the middle row doesn't work too well. Do take a look:

"I like the look of the 1 in binary too...."
Robert: Thanks. Yes, Orator is all caps. It's your call finally, but the concept seemed so interesting that I couldn't resist playing around with it for a few minutes. Just in case you'd like to go along this route, it may be an idea to use the 0s and 1s as a sort of secondary property. For instance you could use it as a background pattern on your website, or along the rear-face of your letterheads.   

.

Eben, reading your post was a nice way to start the day this morning:)  I'd be happy to send across the files if it's useful.    

Do take a look at this option to see if this what you were thinking of on colours running through:

As much as I like it I feel that extra line of numerals makes the logo massive; that's a lot of real estate.  Nonetheless, Arun do you mind if I run in the direction you've taken the design?  I think you really hit on something.</div>

If space is an issue, you could always do this:

"do you mind if I run in the direction you’ve taken the design?"

No problem. If it gets anywhere, 'would appreciate it if you'd post. Good luck :)

I loved watching how this logo evolved. It was succinct and pushed and pulled really well. </div>

I personally think i in Binary and l in Colors should not use the same 1 so I stick with 010 combination and since the original concept is to play with Primary colors, so I use only red, yellow, blue for 0, 1, and 0. And it's Andale Mono for your reference (I added the line in 0's to make it read zero la).

Not really Craig, just slapdash execution. Shouldn't be doing that sort of thing on a type forum :)  See if this is a little more comfortable for you:

"I did one according to Arun’s artwork as displayed below..."

Viroj, that's an equally valid solution.

The way I read it, the little coup in the name was that it replaced 'primary colours'  with 'binary colours' thereby promising a richer visual experience. It is sort of 'beyond primary colours'. Which is why I felt a slightly more exuberant palette made sense.

flat colours are much better. So are UC letters.

So is excess space on the top.

Well done Arun. And to you BinaryC... I know you may feel a bit dissapointed by yourself to use Aruns design, but think of it this way. There's so much more to the corporate identity than just the logo. And that's entirely on you...

Well done all.</div>
