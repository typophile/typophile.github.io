body: "Hi all, I'm looking to identify the 3 lines of fonts of this Newfoundland &
  Labrador Licence Plate.  It is the 1966 Come Home Year plate. I've looked everywhere
  but never an exact match, The corners are square and the C and R are unique. I'm
  not sure if there are 3 different fonts. Sorry about the photo but even that is
  hard to find.Any help would be appreciated. Thanls!\r\nSleveen."

  body: "Your sample is probably an alphabet that was purpose-built for stamping license
    plates. The practice of taking alphabets designed for printing on paper (fonts)
    and adapting them for other reproduction processes (such as embossing letters
    and numbers on metal license plates) didn't become widespread until 15-20 years
    after this license plate was made. In 1966, the word <em>font</em> meant a set
    of letters for printing on paper, so you won't find these letterforms on any list
    of fonts that existed in 1966. \r\nIf you research modern-day fonts using the
    attributes of these letters (monoline, sans serif, square corners) I imagine you'll
    find a good match, or something that will match if you tweak it a bit. "

  body: Ya, I figured it would be hard to find but I thought I could find something
    similar. If I could find the square "O's" I could make the "C".

  body: Thank you very much fvilanakis! I'm pretty sure I can work with those fonts,
    especially The NFL Chargers 2007. And thanks PublishingMojo for your insight.
    I appreciate the help.
