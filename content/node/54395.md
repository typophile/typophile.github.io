  strange things happen in the Word2007 fontmenu. The .notdef glyph appears a couple
  of times after the fontname. Why is this? Do I have to change a setting? The fonts
  are generated using FontLab on a Macintosh computer.\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nPieter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontmenu_word2007_6188.jpg]"

    Hebrew or Thai, and you don't have any characters from that range in the font.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    There are no Greek glyphs in the fonts. \r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPieter"

    recommended that you set the Greek codepage for MS Word.\r\nI think it has to
    do with the PFM default character. \r\nIn Adobe Caslon Pro and Garamond Pro the
    Greek codepage is set, and the PFM default character is \"space\". Font names
    look good in Word. In Tekton Pro the PFM Default character is \"bullet\",and not
    \"space\", and this is what you get\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tektonWord_5074.jpg]"

    that be recommended?"

  body: Please look at fonts from Adobe and Linotype, containing Latin 2, Turkish
    and Baltic, but not Greek and/or Cyrillic. These fonts all have Greek flagged.
    As far as I can remember this had something to do with Word not recognizing the
    extra Latin characters. Couldn't find were the info is, so it might also have
    to do with another program.

  body: Thanks. Indeed I found the Greek codepage bit in some fonts, for example Adobe
    Caslon Pro. Hm. I had never heard of this before.

  body: Is it possible that certain programs will place a font with extended Latin
    at the very bottom of the font menu (despite alphabetical order) and by setting
    the Greek, it will place the font back within the main/top font menu?
