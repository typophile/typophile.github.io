  body: "No, but I would guess 25. I'd also say that as there are thousands of regional,
    local, and student newspapers in print world-wide, and because Swift can be licensed
    by anyone for newspaper use, its a trick question  - no one can know for sure.\r\n\r\n"

      it currently? Are any printed in English or is it a Dutch domination?\r\n\r\n-thanks
      again in advance"

    direct so Gerard would know how many papers are using it.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    as Si just pointed out, is the typeface which is being used in X-many newspapers."

  body: "You're probably right Swift is the house font of the UofR.\r\n\r\nAscender
    didn't report any Swift usage in the USA (this was front page analysis only) -
    http://www.ascendercorp.com/pr/pr2004_11_09.html \r\n\r\nBut that's not too surprising
    - I think you'll find it in use in Europe, maybe C. & S. America too. \r\n\r\n

    that I can come up with now is <a href=\"http://www.trouw.nl\">Trouw</a>.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    \"today, Swift is <a href=\"http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns08.html\">used
    more outside newspapers than in them</a>, especially for corporate identities
    and as a text type for periodicals\", according to Unger himself."
