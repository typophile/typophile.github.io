  body: "Logo lettering with no close match in mini serif fonts. Agenda URW has some
    similarities, but has significant differences, notably that it is a demi-serif,
    i.e. serifs on only one side of the base of the vertical strokes, and none on
    the R leg.\r\nOne possibility is to compress a sans with a moderately thick and
    thin character and a similar S and R, square it somewhat and tack on mini serifs.
    For example FF Page Sans Bold https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/page-sans/bold?aid=4\r\nDon"

    if you want good models for the mini-serifs, you might consider the soft rounded
    style shown in fonts like Canterbury Old Style  RR http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/canterbury-old-style-rr/\r\nDon"
