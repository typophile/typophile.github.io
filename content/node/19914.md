    believe \u2013 and include Icon Composer which is what most icon designers use
    in addition to Photoshop and a 3D application. There's a good overview on icon
    design <a href=\"http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/14607/The_Making_of_an_Icon.html\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nAs
    for assigning icons, <a href=\"https://www.panic.com/candybar/\">Candybar</a>
