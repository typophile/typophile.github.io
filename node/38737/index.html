<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi there.
I just discover this site... great!
just in time, I did a new logo for our company and, even I like it, I have little doubts, mostly abot the first "e".
I would apreciatte any kind of critique and opinions on it.
[[http://www.eragin.com/txo/logo_eragin2.jpg|the logo]]
I actually tried some diferente "e" and finnaly that's the one... here some that I tried with (the first is the one I used finally): [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_versions_3506.jpg]
My idea was to create a especific type for this logo, not two complicated, readable (is this word ok in english?) and kind of contemporary... or something :P
We use the type inside this rounded black square as a base, and them put some draw or imagotype behind, change colour or texture depending on when and where we are using it... it's a very dinamic logo... but that's another story...
how about this type?
thanks to all

<div class=commentbody>You use the word "contemporary", be careful that this does not become dated! I would say...fonts like these tend to date very quickly. I would not use them personally. Also think about what you are telling the reader, do you need to tell them you are a ".com" business or can they find that out themselves easily?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The e is the least of your concerns. I see a big pool of white in the g that is very distracting, and the m is driving me nuts because it looks like it's about 2/3 the size that it should be, especially when compared to the n. Look at it both upside-down and very small to get a better sense of how well the positive and negative spaces are balanced and how the characters relate to each other.

<div class=commentbody>hi
it's true what you say rydere about contemporary and the dated staff... actually I've been thinking quite a lot about that and make my/our decision on that. Actually we have quite clear this staff about "modern" design becoming dated and do so on our designs.
Actually I ask you people because I wanted to do a balance logo cause a well done "contemporary" design use to be less dated.
About the .com staff: we allready spent 6 years with this brand (sometimes with .com sometimes not) and after asking once and again to ourselves this what you are saying (involving all that staff with the dot com companys etc etc) we decided that in the limits that we move, the clients we have and so on... the .com defines quite a lot our company (works we do, way we work) and decide to leave there on the brand.
(right now we're making our new brand site, there is a very old site there at eragin.com, but at the moment we'll start using this logo hardly, there'll be a quite powerfull site, I guess). I really apreciatte what you say, cause I think they are very important staff even this time (wrong or not) they're allready decided.
Koppa: uh.. your right about the g... I'll take a look at this. about the M you're also right, this time it was conscious because if I left the M like it should be it was too big (and I say this related with the .com staff rydere say) and the .com was taking too many space in the logo... uhm... shoddy work? I'll take a look to this also, maybe I'll post some of the previous Ms.
thank you very much folks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi
I did some corrections about the g and the m.
the firs in the image is the original one.
the second is the one I use as "good" for the moment: I did an m with the right size and cut a little bit from the inner part of the tail of the g to make that white mass more light(sorry if I don't explai too clear, but I don't realy know the english right words for typo).
the third one I made the g more straght, maybe more "right"... but I think I still like the other g, what you think? the m has the first hollow (hole?) a little bit bigger..
at the fourth I tried a diferent g cutting white from the outter part of the tail and leaving the inner as it war.. I think I still like the second... and tried a diferent m but I guess the other m works better with the round rhythm of the other letters.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eragin_bidean_3541.jpg]
let me know what you think please.
thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Like Koppa mentioned the area of white in the g where the counter meets the descender is distracting in its weightiness, a little work on the open counter might help. Of the m iterations the second of your latest version is an improvement, although the transition of curve to vertical on the right isn't quite there yet. Overall there is too much overshoot on the characters, exacerbated by there only being three which aren't curved top and bottom, the r especially is jumping. Rework are the heaviness of the junctions in the e, a, g and, to a lesser extent, n.
