  body: It&#39;s the combo of the A and C that is the problem. I thought SPA is Caslon
    and C is Century. But that wouldn&#39;t make sense, I doubt the original designer
    used multiple fonts. I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s press type from the 70&#39;s and
    the font is no longer available

  body: Ha! Adriano, very funny. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The C is more of an engraver&#39;s variation.
    I know this, I just can&#39;t find it.

  body: This is Tiffany squooshed. The serifs are not quite right. I took a Tiffany

    224</a> with a modified C. But not squooshed...
