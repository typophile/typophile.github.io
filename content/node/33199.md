  body: U&lc was always 11 x 14.75 until around 1998 when they switched to a smaller
    8.5 x 11 format. As for margins etc., the design is quite varied over their 25+
    years as a print publication, so you will have to check specific issues for those
    details. try a university library for back issues. Also, check out the great book
    on the history of U&lc edited by John Berry and published by <a href="http://www.markbattypublisher.com/servlet/book_view?number=23">Mark
    Batty</a>.

    using indesign and for the bleed for A4 formats and below, i usually choose a

    for bigger formats i go until 10 mmm bleed and 30 mm margins. It's always depends
    on something, so i don't know the best way to find out it's working in this domain.\r\nwebee

    as Bojev mentioned, was for the first several years. You get the information by
    measuring an issue. There is a book available on the whole history of U&lc.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Would you know the name of the book Chris? And about measuring gutter width,
    how do I measure accurately i.e. some letters poke out at the end of a margin
    than others. How do I know where to measure at? It's easy to identify the beginning
    of a margin if left flush but what about the end of the other margin? Or am I
    being silly now? :D

    body: Do they have small format versions too? because I have the one that is slightly
      larger than an A3 when seen as a double page spread. So does this mean that
      U&lc don't have a specific grid system on each section or article within their
      magazine then? Hmmmm, I wonder. Is it like Baseline where every article is varied
      in structure etc? What issues are these and what yr? I shall check the website
      out too. It's weird how they don't have a website liek Creative Review. Thanks
      anyway.

    \r\n\r\nNo, it isn't wierd! U&lc's last issue was published in 1998 or 1999. It
    is not a printed magazine anymore.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a sort of \"online
    version\" on the ITCfonts.com website. Look here \u2013 http://www.itcfonts.com/Ulc/4012/"
