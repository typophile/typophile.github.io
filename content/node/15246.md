  a certain mood through their mere design but at the same time are not too literal
  (i.e. no tear drop shapes for sadness)? In particular the feelings on the bleaker
  end of the spectrum; sadness, melancholia, depression. \r\n\r\nI am attempting to
  design such a font and the task is proving more difficult than I initially assumed,
  and figured I could use some inspiration.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    fit that bill. Happily, I have no assertions to back this view up.

    prove difficult. Expressing complex emotions like that depends a lot on context
    and personal experiences and memories."

  body: "I agree with Mark. I think the most you might be able to pull off is a vague
    and faint sense of \"sadness\", and only among some people - plus you'll certainly
    get other associations too (like elegance) in fact maybe more strongly.* The general
    traits I would look for are: narrow, small x-height, light, high waist, somewhat
    weathered finish, and old-fashioned terminals (like balls, but small ones). Maybe
    something that has an old French colonial air about it - a bit like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20897.html
    _\r\nBut taller caps, and daintier serifs.\r\n\r\n* It seems like maybe traits
    that have strong tangible representations have a better hope than emotions (which
    are rarely associated with any physical form).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "the cliche way: sloppy handwriting fonts\r\n\r\nmore personal associations:
    i think smashing pumpkins seriously damaged my view of victorian era faces. i
    associate the emotions of their music with the art they used on their albums,
    including victorian faces: Glorietta (Victorian Swash), Art Gothic, &c. so to
    me Victorian Swash = Melencholy (Mellon Collie, heh!)"
