  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Edit: I've added two revisions of the flyer below called 005.pdf 006.png</strong> 
I havent had the chance to rework the body copy yet... but that will get done when i get the chance. Unfortunately we're only allowed to use one side of the flyer (even though I really like some of the suggestions to split the flyer over the two sides). Further comments and suggestions welcomed!

P.S - I've noticed some of the sperm come out looking rather fuzzy, this is only because of the image compression ;-)



Hello all,

I was recently assigned a project in my second year Communication Design course and have come up with a decent concept but am looking for ways to improve either the design or type or both before handing in finals. Below I have included a quick backgrounder on the project and attached the PDF file. Thanks for taking the time to look at this everyone… I really appreciate it!

<strong>Quick Backgrounder</strong>
This project will address the social impact of graphic design and allow you to explore print design as a vehicle of persuasion. You will research a social health or environmental issue and develop a strong point of view about it. Using words and images you will produce a provocative, visually dynamic and persuasive flyer aimed at a specific audience.

The topic I decided on was <strong>Teenage Pregnancy</strong>

<strong>Goal:</strong>
Your objective is to make the best use of the vehicle available to persuade the target audience to accept your point of view.</div>

Your image needs to be absolutely clear how a condom works, any ambiguity could confuse, I know that most teenagers will know how they work but the ones that don't probably represent your chief target audience.
What is the size of your flyer?

		<div class="commentbody">I agree completely with the other two comments. Just multiplying the illustrated sperm would help, really...

But in addition to that, if you have time, I would reconsider the illustration style, especially the default illustrator brush outlines. The technique doesn't feel as serious as the problem you're trying to address. I know you're going for the teen audience and trying to be casual, but I would personally give it another iteration to really nail how menacing the sperm look. 

(Take this with a grain of salt, I'm only one year ahead of you in school!) Good luck!</div>

<strong>Brampitoyo:</strong> 
Yeah you've got the idea, just an overall critique to do with anything... design, type, or communication of the message.

<strong>timd  & KenBessie </strong> 
Sorry my fault about the strong tags, didn't realize I had left one open. Should be fixed now :-) Hmmm I totally agree with your points about the image not working to its potential... perhaps by duplicating the sperm, making them smaller and more aggressive looking I could create that swarm effect I'm looking for. About the condom, I see what you mean it being rather ambiguous with the sword and all, but I was hoping to go for a more comical approach. But I think as you said it could have more of an impact if the condom was over the egg in some fashion protecting it. <strong>timd</strong>, when you talk about changing to the 1/3 concept, do you mean redoing the entire design or just choosing to use that as my main catch header? Oh and the flyers size is 8.5 x 14 an insert into a magazine with no diecuts or folds. 

<strong>mllecait</strong>
Hmm that’s an idea, do you know of any good sources to get more illustrator bushes? Not sure what style I would go with, but it would be interesting to try out a few other looks

<strong>seventy7</strong>
Yeah your totally right about this, my copy will change before the final. The main concepts that I wanted to get across are there in the text, but the copy needs a lot of tweaking and cleaning up.

Thanks once again to all who commented! You all had great suggestions and I think I have few more ideas to take this flyer to the next level.

In that case, you've got two sides to work with. I would suggest the 20 million to one message on the front ('cause its attention-getting), and the three to one message on the back ('cause it offers more information).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Either you need to improve your current image or think it from another angle, my feelings are that you should think about the 3:1 as it speaks to your audience personally and that will require a redesign. However, if you want to stick with the 20 million headline your illustration should in some way represent that, you could represent that in the cartoon style or with an image like <a href="http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/classes/FrameSet.aspx?&UQR=ruiykd&pk=4&source=front&lightboxView=1&txtSearch=sperm&selImageType=7&chkLicensed=on&chkRoyaltyFree=on&chkNLM=on">this</a> or a information graphic. The condom, because it doesn't, shouldn't be represented as protecting the egg, you could represent it as something catching/blocking the sperm. I'm not sure that a cartoon style works to portray a serious subject. As it is a magazine insert and less likely to be read by three people at once you might need to rewrite the body copy a little.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the copy and concept aren't overly strong. It's like you've taken the statistics and tried to make them interesting with a coloured page ... it doesn't work like that. Think OUTSIDE the box - and page, and literal delivery of the concept.

More specifics: the condom 'defending' the egg doesn't really move us forward in terms of social/sexual equality, nor does it in my opinion reflect a strong or accurate message of where/why/how condoms should be used and viewed by teens. I also don't like the idea of swords anywhere near my sperm. Think about your audience.

		<div class="commentbody">Not sure if this has been said, but with the copy: I read "20 million" and then "Sperm, Only one egg... Like the odds?" Breaking it between the two is awkward and confusing -- I don't know how to read the sentence. I think "sperm" needs to be kept with 20 million for the message to get through first read. Also the capitalization indicates that "Sperm" is starting a new sentence or thought, as does Only, except it comes after a comma... and then the reader gets confused. 

Try "20 million sperm. (Only one egg. Like the odds?)"
I think having the word sperm up there nice and big will grab way more attention.

Try this:
20 million sperm.
1 egg.
Like the odds?

On three separate lines. Use a nice condensed sans (that's still friendly enough, of course) and the retrofit each line, so "1 egg" would have a bigger size than "20 million sperms". The nice thing about this method is that it'll really highlight your main point.

Visually, I like number 6 if you would further highlight the condom. I can't see the suggested "tip" very well. It's really clever, though!

Best of luck!</div>
