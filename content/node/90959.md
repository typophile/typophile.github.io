  font with six alternative glyphs for most characters. For now, the alternative glyphs
  are available manually in InDesign, but I wish to run through the glyphs, or add
  an automatic randomizing feature. Unfortunately, I need detailed direction on how
  to make this happen, as it is just over my head. Is there such a resource, or is
  anyone willing to help. Thanks in advance.'
