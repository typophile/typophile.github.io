    and friendly advise and criticism on my typeface project here on Typophile after
    quite recently joining, all very well communicated, and most of them of immense
    value. After all, many of the members here on Typophile are among the absolute
    best type and graphical designers in the world.   \r\n\r\n<em>And what\u2019s

    give you my opinion based on my non-professional taste: I don't like that joining
    of the letters, it packs an extreme mass of horizontal weight on the logo, while
    not communicating anything. That red stripe just emphasises it.\r\n\r\nIn fact,
    I think your best suggestion is the one with stencil letters. A non-grungey mechanistic
    black stencil type could work great. And that cogwheel-thing isn't bad, how about
    simplifying it (fewer and more distinct teeth), making it a full circle and use
    it as a little sun above the letters?  "

  body: "These two examples are  a step forward from what you've presented to us before.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I'm curious as to what kind of a design education you have, because everything
    I've seen come from you seems very amateurish.\r\n\r\nOne thing I see in these
    is a need to work on getting visual balance and fixing your kerning in some spots.\r\nIn
    your first one, the E and R are too tight and the S and T are just a hair too
    open.\r\n\r\nSecond one: the circle is again causing strange spacing of the K
    from the rest of the letters, at least visually. I would avoid outlining type
    in most cases. In this case, the S is very distracting because of how close the
    strokes are together. This makes the letterform look heavier than the rest because
    optically, the lines blend into one at some point. The letterspacing around the
    T is again too open. \"Maschine\u2026\" is too tightly tracked and close to the
    rest of the wordmark. Brought down in size, you won't be able to read it.\r\n\r\nThis
    website is a great reference for education on typography http://www.papress.com/other/thinkingwithtype/index.htm"

    foremost is the question, \"What are you trying to tell us with this mark?\"  What
    I see happening is that you're doing your best to make this look cool and high
    tech, but there isn't a reason that we can see as to \"WHY\" you're doing it.
    \ Start answering that question as literally as you can, with type or graphics
