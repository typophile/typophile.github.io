  this correctly, sufficiently and within the guidelines of the forum :)\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for the typeface used in the 1616 \"The Whole Works of Homer\" translated
  by George Chapman, which (to my knowledge \u2014 and please correct me if you know
  otherwise) is the first substantial English translation of Homer's The Odyssey.\r\n\r\nNow,
  I am guessing that it won't be possible to find an exact match of the typeface used
  in the images referenced further down, but I am looking for a typeface which is
  as close as possible to the looks, time-period and origin, in a (revived) digitized
  font today.\r\n\r\nSo the criteria, I guess, is that it has to be a typeface which
  was used around the beginning of the 1600's in England (where the book is published)
  and is revived in a usable font today, which matches the characteristics of the
  typeface used in the book.\r\n\r\nAlso other probable typefaces of the time can
  be a solution if that is the closest possible match.\r\n\r\nThus far I have been
  able to find some info about the [[http://iginomarini.com/fell/the-revival-fonts/|Fell
  types]], but these I don't think are the ones used in the book.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here
  is the material for reference, and thank you all very much in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chapmanshomer_6513.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lf_5762.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,

  body: "1. Link to Google search broken.\r\n2. The first page is an engraving, not
    type faces.  The printer of the engraving i.e. William Hole Sculp. [i.e. engraver]
    is not necessarily the printer of the book.\r\n3. So it seems that what we are
    searching for is is the text font & italic used by an unknown printer for the
    body of the second image. It would be helpful if we could pin this down to a specific
    printer. also the scale is too small to say anything for certain. \r\n3. Here
    are some images of another Chapman book from 40 years later printed by Humphrey
    Moseley. If you have a larger scale printed image you should be able to determine
    if this is the same, or at least very similar type, to the ones in it uses.\r\n

    it matches we can think about digital substitutes.\r\nIf not we can try something
    else.\r\ndon"

  body: "There is very little that is suitable to reproduce these pages. \r\nGaramond
    and several others based on designs of the 1500s could be a possibility but modern
    digital versions lack the ligatures etc then used by printers.\r\nWe have at least
    one text and Italic based on printing from the mid 1600s, but they also lack ligatures.
    Jeff Lee has created JSL Ancient and JSL Ancient Italic and has made them freely

    problem with the url.\r\n3. As I tried to explain in the post, I am not expecting
    an exact match to the references provided, so in other words: What typeface would
    be a common use by English printers in the beginning of the 1600's in a usable
    revived font today?\r\n\r\n4. Thanks in advance.\r\n5. PS. here's the link that

  body: "You're welcome.\r\nAs for your question \"What typeface would be a common
    use by English printers in the beginning of the 1600's in a usable revived font
    today?\" the answer is that there were a variety of dissimilar typefaces, some
    Garamondesques, others Dutch, some Venetians, etc. In the absence of an image
    from your book approaching the detail of the mid 17th century specimen I posted,
    it is not possible to recommend a specific digitized font. About all I can say
    is that it would be pre-Caslon with low contrast. If you don't have a more detailed
    image you could check the facsimiles of Shakespeare first folio 1623\r\nhttp://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/facsimile/overview/book/F1.html\r\nand
    pick something digital from the references I posted earlier.\r\nThere is a real
    gap in digitized typefaces for anyone wanting to recreate books from this era.
    Perhaps at some future date a publisher might commission a fontmaker to produce
    a font that would be used for a re-issue of the Shakespeare first folio 1623,
    complete with it's ligatures, contractions and other printer's quirks. At least
    that would be something.\r\ndon"

  body: "I checked the Shakespeare 1623 against modern digital typefaces and in my
    opinion it is printed in a Garomondesque type style. I suggest that  would be
    best rendered by using \"Garamond Premier\" designed by Robert Slimbach. After
    he finished Adobe Garamond, Slimbach created a more \"authentic\" Garamond revival
    that was closer to its sources than other digital Garamonds. The Pro versions
    include Italic swash variations and Roman alternates. It is not perfect for all
    of the letter variations, contractions etc.  in Shakespeare 1623, but is as close
    as I can find.\r\nIf your examination of Chapman shows that it seems to resemble
    the Shakespeare facsimiles in the link I posted, then Garamond Premier is as close,
    in my opinion, as you are going to get for a match to Chapman.\r\ndon"
