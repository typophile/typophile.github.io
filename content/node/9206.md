  body: Generally, the person typesetting the book and sending it to press must own
    a license for fonts used. Most font licenses -- including those that come bundled
    with software -- allow any use of the font that does not involve distribution.
    Some may allow embedding of the font, e.g. in a PDF going to pre-press, but may
    not allow embedding in an electronic book that will be distributed. If in doubt,
    read the font software license. If still in doubt, contact the font vendor.
