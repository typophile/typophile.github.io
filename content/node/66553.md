  body: "I think this is hand-drawn, and roughly based on Engravers Old English. The
    L in Club is not right, and even the C's were only approximately like the original
    letter. The A and Z are both simplified. I think someone wanted a Gothic look
    that was more legible than the actual font would have been.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
