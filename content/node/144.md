  In light of recent events, we&#39;ve decided to hire a bouncer. <BR> <BR>Critique,
  News &amp; Events, and Technical Issues will now require an account to post. <BR>
  <BR>General Discussions will still allow users to post under a pseudonym without
  an account. If a forums user would like to post free of anonymous respondents, they
  can post to Technical Issues. <BR> <BR><B>Typophile Forum accounts are still free</B>
  - if you haven&#39;t done so yet, join the hundreds of others who have clicked &#34;Login/Register&#34;
  to sign up for instant registration. It&#39;s quick and hassle-free. <BR> <BR>While
  we encourage healthy debate and meaningful discussion, posts containing inflammatory
  remarks and/or personal attacks will be deleted in their entirety by the board moderator.  <BR>

  body: 'Christian, the issue was that Jared wants to close off a good portion of
    the forums to anonymous posters - I think it&#39;s better if he creates a members-only
    area than close existing access. <BR> <BR>My Mustang gets a mention here, a sad
    day indeed - mines a long way from the site of it&#39;s birth &#40;Nottingham,
    England&#41;, I bought it in Wellington, about five years ago - must be some kind
    of Commonwealth thing, there&#39;s a few Raleighs around here. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.mtbreview.com/passion/messages/235641.html"

    you have to convert a Ford Mustang to right hand drive in the UK Hrant? What kind
