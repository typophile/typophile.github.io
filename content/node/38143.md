  body: "Thanks Patty... I should have searched the topic first! I read the trhead
    and I didn't know it's a design from Crhistian Scwartz, very outstanding. I couldn't
    find the Mil Mascaras font, \xBFwhere did you see it?\r\n\r\nStill anyone knows
    what's the blocky egyptian titling face?\r\n\r\nStephen, of course you can use
    them, let me email you the originals later (they have a bit of noise because I
    took them at ISO 400 but still they are 6 mpx)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
