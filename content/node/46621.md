body: "Hi guys\r\n\r\nI'm designing a logo for a company which produces expensive
  bespoke clothing. I want to find a seriphed font which has a classic feel about
  it - not dissimilar to those used by long-established suit-makers/professional outfitters.\r\n\r\nI
  want something which is (very) slightly heavier than Garamond. I'm also looking
  a font which has a slightly unorthodox ampersand.\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be very
  helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDrew"
