  I'm looking for a highresolution printer ideally A3 size. I know they are pretty

  body: Yes there are a few really good typophile threads on laser printers. Im using
    an [[http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/en/WF06b/18972-18972-3328059-14638-236263-1137934-1137935-1137940.html|HP
    Laserjet 5200]] which is really good, but makes type slightly whispy (thiner than
    offset). Good for proofing designs, probably not so good for proofing type though.

    about a printer sampling service which may be of help.

    text rendering you can\u2019t get better printers, and Postscript just flies out
    of them. Now if only I could afford to replace my Konica Minolta with a Xante
    here at home..."

  body: Xante is definitely the way to go for printing text, the 4G is especially
    good. The only drawback is the quality on grey areas isn't that great or smooth.
    But if you're using it for mostly type, it is well worth it. It does a pretty
    good job handling jobs from multiple computers at once, too.

    to render most shades of gray and that can get pretty gross. But I find the output
    from the B&W Xante printers is great, although it can get pretty weak when the
    toner gets low."

    that chokes the real imagesetter, which actually happens quite a bit since they
    print all of the highschool and college newspapers in Seattle, they print out
    to the Xante and shoot film of the output!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I use an HP 5000. I'd switch to an HP 5200 but this sucker is seven years
    old and just keeps on ticking. Slower than the latest iteration but these days
    speed is relative.\r\n\r\nI had considered an Xante, for a number of reasons,
    including film processing (at 2400dpi), but specimens that were sent by the company
    revealed an awful lot of toner scatter, and since I was mainly interested in camera
    ready reproduction (back in 2000) I opted for the HP. Actually, can't say I regret
    it. At an institution where I teach they have an Xante with film capacity (actually
    on my recommendation) and they have a lot of software connection problems with
    it plus repair maintenance is unbelievably expensive.\r\n\r\nPlus, even with 2400dpi
    and film capacity, the Xante still can't anywhere come near the quality of an
    imagesetter.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    type. For layouts & design, however, it is excellent. I was absolutely furious
    to find that it was rubbish for proofing type, especially buying it new. So I
    am on the lookout for a decent proofing printer. Sigh.\r\n\r\nI have also heard
    from a few other designers that they are having problems with new HP cartridges
    printing 'wispy' type. Be interesting to know if anyone else is having the same
    problems. \r\n\r\n\u2014K"
