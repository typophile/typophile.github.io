  is quite modern (not overtly so), but has some sort of suggestion of traditional,
  almost decorative details in its characters/ligatures. \r\n\r\nI was having a look
  at Leitura by the DS type foundry (http://www.dstype.com/specimens.html), but not
  quite what I'm after... \r\n\r\nI understand it may be a confusing question, but
  any help would be greatly appreciated. Oh, and I don't mind if I have to add in
  the decorative elements myself, but it would be nice if the font somewhat suggested
  them. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nBen"
