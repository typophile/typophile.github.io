  body: "I think \"CREATIVE MEXICAN\" looks like a modification of Cartoon Bold, an
    Oldstyle font that was in the old Image Club collection. I can't find an online
    version right now.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth I suspect the Zocalo lettering is
    an altered serif font, possibly <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/arrus/bitstream-arrus-black/\"
    target=\"new\">Bitstream Arrus Black</a>\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I think the "CREATIVE MEXICAN" is Bitstream's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/mister-earl/"
    target="_blank">Mister Earl</a>, stretched around 200%. And I agree with Mike
    on the ZOCALO.
