  body: Hi Will, This is not a font; it is lettering that was probably done by Dr.
    Seuss himself. You can see that identical letters have slightly different shapes.

  body: However, I should mention that there is a freeware font called &#39;Dr Seuss&#39;
    or &#39;Drseuss&#39; that is based on this style of lettering. You can find it
    by using <a href="http://www.fontseek.com" target="_blank">Fontseek</a>.

  body: Stuart Sandler &#40;<a href="http://www.fontdiner.com/" target="_blank">Font
    Diner</a>&#41; has a Dr. Seuss-inspired font called Jumping Bean &#40;part of
    the &#34;Doggie Bag&#34; collection&#41;. <BR> <BR>There was also a font created
    for the Grinch movie a few years ago, but I don&#39;t think it has ever been made
    available to the public. It had a Seussian feel to it, but was much more restrained.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/Lettering/thegrunch.html" target="_blank">I&#39;ve
    done this style of lettering before</a>, and I think it is very difficult to truly
    capture the irregular quality of Dr. Seuss&#39; lettering style in a font. Type
    just doesn&#39;t work that way.
