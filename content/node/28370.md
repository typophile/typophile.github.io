  while I'm at it, I figure I might as well ask, does anyone know if the attached
  image below is a font, or if it was hand made? I'm assuming it was hand made, but
  it doesn't hurt to ask."

    be very easy to construct the first one using rectangles, especially if it's only
    a logo and not a lot of running text.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    in the attachment so there's never any confusion.\r\n\r\nI prefer their old logo,
    if not just because it actually looks like a logo a video game company would have,
    and the 5 doesn't look like an S.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/level5old_4197.gif]"

  body: Gotcha, I just think it's a crappy logo if you can't read it properly. They
    should at least use a different color for the 5.
