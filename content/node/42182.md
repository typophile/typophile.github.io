  body: "Recently we had a question about a similar set of angled initials that turned
    out to be [[http://www.typotheque.com/fedra_sans_display|Fedra Sans Display]].
    My point is that the enduring popularity of the Avant Garde Gothic alternates
    has apparently inspired some modern designers to offer similar alternate characters.
    The Avant Garde alternate letters are about 38 years old, so if they are 'trendy'
    then it's proof of the cyclical nature of design tastes (and what happens when
    younger designers 'discover' and appreciate the classic typeface designs).\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks, I didn't know about the Fedra angle.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that any
    time I manage to id a font before anyone else, it's Avant Garde 75 % of the time.
    I suppose it tells more about me than current trends."

  body: avant garde is *super* trendy right now among younger designers who are still
    at the age where one feels the need to be a part of the zeitgeist. a lot of these
    folks are the same ones doing a lot of the eighties retro stuff that keeps popping
    up. it'll go away once their kneejerk irony dies down.

  body: 'Re: Avant Garde returning as trendy...in New York it''s the same phenomenon
    as with young architects who think office buildings from 1960 are so cool they
    should be revived, exactly as bland and crappy as ever, in midtown, so now we''re
    stuck with them all over--the new New York Times building, for instance. And I
    was here when those original buildings were new--ugh! Endless cyclical stupidity!'
