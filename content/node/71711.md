body: I watched The Godfather (part I) last night. I'd like to identify the typeface
  used on screen to supply English translations for the dialogue in Sicilian (not
  the familiar title font, as also seen on 'The Godfather' book covers). Unfortunately,
  I don't have a screen grab. The typeface I'm looking for somewhat resembles Baker
  Signet or Albertus, more closely resembles what I suspect is a copycat font called
  'Flanders'. I couldn't turn anything up on Google except the the title font, not
  what I'm looking for. Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

  body: "Mystery solved, Mike, and thanks. 'Flanders' is indeed 'Flange' (or a version
    thereof), and also, I believe, the font used for The Godfather (I) English subtitles.
    One of its notable characteristics is the open, informal, lower-case 'g' - most
    of the similar glyphic fonts have the closed-loop 'g'. Flanders, lower-case open
    'g' and all, was one of the many fonts included on the FontSite CD, which I got
    years ago because it was then the sole source for 'Legende' (their redaction being
    called 'Legend'). I bought the excellent Bitstream Cambridge Collection similarly
    to acquire one typeface, 'Venetian 301', which I consider a better-looking digitalization
    of 'Centaur'  than Monotype's. Anyway, I was curious about 'Flanders', and spent
    several sessions and some time searching for likely fonts with similar-sounding
    names (Fontsite's naming practice being roughly homophonic), but never turned
    up 'Flange', and never saw it in use until I happened to watched ' The Godfather'.\r\n\r\nThe
    Fontsite CD had one great virtue, an introduction to Hans Eduard Meier's splendid
    but strangely obscure 'Barbedor', which I subsequently acquired elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Just noticed that the open 'g' in 'Flange' is only in the Italic, whereas
    the copycat font uses it in the regular face as well.

    font, Marbrook.
