  body: "Thank you all, but on the Artcraft font, there are subtle differences. Tops
    of letters are more curved on artcraft, serifs of S are slightly different, etc.
    I used the font preview at the fontshop site, but increased the size to 288pt
    and 388 pt and could see slight differences. \r\n\r\nCould the logo have used
    a knockoff font or is another close font? God knows there are dozens of variations
    on Garamond, Palatino, Times, Goudy - just to name a few."

  body: "Evan, I believe that the differences you saw may have been in the version
    of Artcraft, or even tweaks by the artist who made the logo. I have no doubt in
    my mind that Artcraft was the basis for the logo. The typeface was designed by
    Robert Wiebking in 1912\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.exuberance.com/type/artcraft.html\" target=\"_blank\">Matt
    Jalbert's version</a> is closer, but not a match.\r\n\r\nPhilippe, from the MyFonts
    forum, has noted in the past that <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Opti</a> had an Artcraft and that there was a Compugraphic version
    digitized by Alan Prescott. Best of luck trying to deal with Castcraft and I have
    no idea if the CG font is available anywhere these days.\r\n\r\nAs to the curvy
    tops of the letters, that is a distinctive feature of the typeface. A font without
    those wouldn't be Artcraft. Surely that feature was removed by the logo maker."
