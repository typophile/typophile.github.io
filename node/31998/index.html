  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Do the pros making fonts these days for the big foundries really use [[FontLab]] (or, I suppose, [[Fontographer]])?</p>
<p>I recently finished work on a font I needed for internal purposes, but for the sake of education, I decided to make the font as &ldquo;complete&rdquo;, as I could; I implemented a full character set, went through the process of class-based metrics and kerning, etc., even though these features really weren&rsquo;t needed.</p>
<p>I designed the glyphs in [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]], and while that went fine, the process of creating an actual font using FontLab was incredibly tedious. I found the program to be unstable and buggy in numerous aspects, not the least of which was the &ldquo;dissapearing metrics classes&rdquo; I posted about last week (which others have apparently encountered as well).</p>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;d love to make more fonts, but the prospect of having to wade through the FontLab jungle again for such a labor-intensive project is a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>So, to restate my question, would someone working on a complete typeface project (as in, multiple weights, styles, &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; character sets, etc.), like say, Myriad, or Caslon, or whatever, actually use FontLab? I can&rsquo;t imagine getting halfway through a project like that without killing myself. :)</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything better out there, I&rsquo;d <em>love</em> to know about it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>They use all sorts: Fontlab, Fontographer, Robofog and various other small task-specific apps. Python as well. Fontlab is easy once you get used to it. Quite powerful for the big jobs. Although I am too young for Fontographer, I am under the impression that a few developers use it predominantly. Whatever gets the job done, but definately not Illo!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I create outlines in CorelDraw v9 (all subsequent versions have problems, ranging from mildly annoying to really dismal), then I export outlines into Fontographer (because its import function is so much better than FontLab&rsquo;s cut-and-paste via AICB method). I do basic outline clean-up and metrics adjustments in Fontographer, then generate a PS Type 1 font. I then open the PS font in either DTL Fontmaster Light (if I require some serious fine-tuning of outlines, since DTL blows the socks off FontLab in terms of zoomability), or directly into FontLab (if I don&rsquo;t need the zoom). In FontLab, I check the integrity of extrema and tweak the curves, set bounding boxes, do kerning, and generate my final fonts for Opentype, Truetype and PC Postscript. Then, I used Type Tool 2 on Mac OS X to generate the Mac Postscript version (although sometimes TT2 bombs in OS X&ndash;for no stated reason&ndash;and I have to generate the font in TT2 in Mac Classic mode).</p>
<p>The DTL Fontmaster Suite has much to recommend it, and I would probably use it exclusively if not for the fact that it&rsquo;s hideously expensive, and the interface is really clunky. I could probably use FotnLab exclusively if (a) they would improve the import function; (b) add more zoom (I can zoom to 400,000% in CorelDraw); and (c) add more default settings (like license info, designer, designer contact info, copyright, etc).</p>

There are some minor bugs, but I dont find them too bad. They don&rsquo;t really bother me that much, and then again, in future releases much of those issues will probably be dealt with. I find the interface pretty well designed, sometimes small things can get a bit annoying, but overall I can work fairly smoothly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you develop drawings in Illustrator, importing them into FontLab via ScanFont is a snap. You can place the entire uppercase, lowercase, numbers and punctuation, properly scaled and in the correct cell with proper glyph names and unicode code points in about 2 or 3 seconds. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like a problem to me.</p>
<p>As to msa&rsquo;s complaint about FontLab: How many hours do you have working with the program? I work in FontLab 12 hours a day, everyday, and have no problems. Font making requires stamina, it sounds like you have just begun your training. Remember to breath.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">At Adobe we use FontLab for designing (drawing the outlines), and for some parts of the production process (making the font files).
Namely, we do basic hinting setup (alignment zones, standard stems), kerning (although we have our own macros to translate that data into the &lsquo;kern&rsquo; feature), and basic naming for generating &lsquo;.pfa&rsquo; fonts. These are then processed with the [[AFDKO]] tools (Autohint and MakeOTF). For quality assurance we use the AFDKO&rsquo;s CheckOutlines and CompareFamily, among other tools and tests.
We use the [[Multiple Master|Multiple Masters]] technology extensively.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I use FontLab Studio 5 on a Mac. It took a little while to get used to it and set it up in a way that I like but now it seems quite usable. I used to start drawing glyphs in Illy but found that to be a waste of time and needed too much cleanup. Now I just start drawing outlines straight away in FL5. I don&rsquo;t scan anything in, I just use my paper sketches as a notebook reminder if I need to and this is rare. 
I think you have to comit to a work process and set of tools and just work it out by giving time to it. Whether your going through a multistep progression of tools like Nick or just keeping it simply one program, it is up to you. Type design is mostly solitary work so you are not bound by what suits others. Large foundries like Adobe might have more a collaborative process with some more common way of working needed perhaps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A specialized font creation app, yes, but (in my opinion) a clunky drawing application. Again, it&rsquo;s partly what I&rsquo;m used to to, but to me Illustrator or FreeHand <em>are</em> the specialized tools that are best suited for drawing and manipulating vector shapes.</p>
<p>There are font-specific sorts of drawing functions in FontLab that are invaluable, but taking it all into consideration, it would take me at least twice as long and would be twice as hard to draw a font if I were limited only to FontLab&rsquo;s limited and awkward tools.</p>
<p>Really, I&rsquo;m not trying to argue; I just find it interesting that some apparently prefer FontLab for the <em>drawing</em> part of designing a font. When I&rsquo;m working on a font, I invariably have both FontLab running and a <em>real</em> drawing application.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just to weigh in on this discussion . . . The timing couldn&rsquo;t be more appropriate for me since I&rsquo;m just now making the transition from my old work process to my new one . . .</p>
<p>I have drawn all my fonts in Illustrator 8.0 and done the import to FOG process for years and I can see moving forward continuing to draw my letters in Illustrator for the primary reason that the tool feels comfortable to me and I can draw very fast and freely. . .</p>
<p>That said, while I&rsquo;m working through the conversion of the Filmotype library, my job is not creation but tracing and while I could blow quickly through this in Illustrator, I know the work benefits from being traced at scale on a 1000em grid so since I&rsquo;m working on that as my primary goal, it makes perfect sense to draw in that manner right from the start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not terribly fast but I&rsquo;m getting faster and will continue to do all my conversion tracings in FLAB Studio 5.</p>
<p>It remains to be see whether my chops with it will get to the point where it becomes my default drawing app as well. It makes sense that it should but my tastes are split at this point . . .</p>
<p>One thing I will point out working wih both systems is that I LOVE the way I can clearly see the outline forms when I&rsquo;m drawing in FLAB, Illustrator has it&rsquo;s own screen rendering engine and sometimes depending on the level of zoom, the forms aren&rsquo;t quite what they should be and even perfectly drawn curves are indeed slighly flat depending on how zoomed in you get and print out differently as well . . .</p>

<p>You may well be right, but here&rsquo;s some evidence: How often are there questions about Illustrator in this &lsquo;build&rsquo; forum? Answer: rare. How often are there questions about FontLab? Answer: Constantly.</p>
<p>How many workshops and discussions, including in the corridors, about drawing in Illustrator are there are font conferences? None that I&rsquo;ve seen or heard. How many about FontLab: lots.</p>

<p>Well, the answer to that is obvious. FontLab&rsquo;s drawing tools require contant non-intuitive workarounds and endless questions from people who have never had the pleasure of working with a real drawing application. Experienced Illustrator users require no such nonsense.</p>
<p>Really, I&rsquo;m just kidding. Couldn&rsquo;t resist. All in fun! Insert smiley face here.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I&rsquo;m am genuinely curious about the attraction to FontLab&rsquo;s drawing tools. With Illustrator (and to a lesser extent FreeHand and CorelDRAW) being the dominant vector drawing program, I assumed that most type designers would have started out using mainstream, dedicated vector drawing applications before they actually took up type design. Which brings up another question: once again, I assumed (and quite possibly mistakenly so) that most type designers started out as graphic designers and, at some point, moved to type design and took their tools with them. I wonder how many mostly full-time type designers first learned a mainstream drawing tool and then gave it up to draw fonts in favor of FontLab&rsquo;s or Fontographer&rsquo;s drawing tools.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve designed a half dozen or so commercial faces over the years, but it&rsquo;s always been completely secondary to an ongoing graphic design and art direction career. Maybe I haven&rsquo;t given FontLab&rsquo;s tools a fair shake (although, I&rsquo;ve honestly tried), but they just don&rsquo;t do what I want them to in the way I want it to happen. Then again, I&rsquo;ve been using Illustrator everyday since 1987 and know it inside and out, so I&rsquo;m obviously looking at it from a skewed and biased perspective.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I prefer to work in one application.
I used to use Fontographer, and switched to FontLab a couple of years ago.
It took me a while to adapt to its drawing tools, as I was really comfortable in Fontographer.
I&rsquo;ve always (almost 20 years!) disliked Illustrator&rsquo;s drawing tools.
BTW, Fontographer was the first vector-drawing application for the &ldquo;personal computer&rdquo;, preceding Illustrator by two years.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine drawing in a program other than Fog or Flab, without the metric guidelines, and without being able to instantly inspect characters in word formation in the metrics panel. Say I&rsquo;m adjusting the ear of the &ldquo;r&rdquo; &ndash; it has to work nicely with several other charatcers, so I type &ldquo;raryrt&rdquo; etc in the metrics panel, and then maybe do the same thing with an alternate version of the r. Then I fiddle with my ears till I get something that works perfectly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a real font professional, but I also do the whole process in FontLab. If I just want to make a drawing, Illustrator&rsquo;s drawing tools are nicer, but if I want to draw font outlines, I find it easier to use FontLab. Why? Because the outline ultimately has to conform to the constraints of font formats, like a 1000 em-unit grid, and I&rsquo;d spend as much time cleaning up an imported Illustrator outline in FontLab as I would just drawing it in FontLab to start with. It&rsquo;s not that I think FL&rsquo;s drawing tools are so great for drawing, it&rsquo;s that they fit the constraints of the final result.</p>
<p>Then again, I&rsquo;ve never been a graphic designer, so I&rsquo;m probably not as good at using Illustrator as I could be.</p>

<p>Oh&hellip; Illustrators vector drawing tool is not half as good as the one in FontLab, believe me. After started using FontLab I do all my &ldquo;illustrator-work&rdquo; in FontLab rather than Illustrator. It makes so much more sense. Further on, you have fantastic tools in FontLab that Illustrator even don‘t come close. In my opinion FontLab is wonderful, I love it :)</p>

But I&rsquo;m not good enough with the FL tools yet, and if I can do certain curves better in Illustrator, I usually do that. Because the result needs to have somekind of curve-quality, of course. ;)
But then again, I have trained myself in placing points in Illustrator in extrema, and such, so most of the times I don&rsquo;t have to tweak too much when getting the vectors into FL.</div>

I started drawing with the very first version of Illustrator. I am quite comfortable with it and still use it for everything except type design. It would take me 3 times longer to do just the glyph drawing in Illustrator as it does in FL5 and I have been using FontLab for only 2 years.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I guess I&rsquo;m a font &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; though only in the use of type, not drawing. When I have to draw up a special character, it is a nervous day. But I spend a lot of time working with metrical data and writing OT features. For this, I find FontLab difficult to use, and do much of the work outside FontLab. The Metrics panel is OK to see kern values, though it&rsquo;s resolution is not the best &ndash; I suppose no screen-based panel could be much better.</p>
<p>I write off the AFM files for pairs, check values for some class-based kerning in the FontLab window, but do all the actual work in a text editor &ndash;  V-Edit which is a reasonably sophisticated one &amp; also supports a columnar mode. There are probably better choices for text editors today.</p>
<p>I write the features in the text editor as well. When done, import into Fontlab &amp; compile.</p>
<p>One plus is I always have a separate file of the features, so when I need to go back and add or modify one, it is pretty straightforward. Like today, when I&rsquo;ll have to add a kern between any number and any numerator for a font that supports unlimited fractions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So, in answer to the original question, the consensus seems to be that individuals work in their comfort zones, and there&rsquo;s no single approach which works best for everyone.</p>
<p>I create my outlines in CorelDraw because I&rsquo;ve been using it since v1, and its tools seem second nature to me now. I like the fact that I can use a <strong>single tool</strong> (the Shape Tool) to&hellip;</p>
<ul><li>add or delete nodes;</li>
<li>make a node sharp, smooth or symmetrical;</li>
<li>change a line segment from straight to curve, and vice-versa;</li>
<li>rotate, scale or align nodes; and</li>
<li>add but not move or delete guidelines (essentially locking them during curve editing; guidelines can be added, moved and deleted with the Pick Tool).</li>
</ul>
FontLab's <strong>merge contours</strong> function is OK, but it's trim and intersect functions suck, and the <strong>smooth curve</strong> slider in CorelDraw v9 is, IMHO, unsurpassed by any other drawing program -- which is important, since its <strong>convert stroke to outline</strong> function tends to be a little promiscuous about adding nodes.
<p>Other tools comes in handy for other tasks, too. When I kern monocase fonts, I only set kerning for the caps. I then export the metrics, open the AFM file in a text editor, copy and save the KPX info to another text file, then open that file in Excel as a space-delimited file (which puts the first and second characters in separate columns), then I copy and paste the kerning info back into the file twice. In the first copy, I run a macro that converts the second character to lowercase, and in the second copy, I convert both the first and second characters to lowercase. I then reverse the process, and end up with an AFM file with identical kerning for caps-caps, caps-lower and lower-lower, then import that into FontLab. This process may not be everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, but it works for me&hellip;</p>

<p>Is this similar to what FontLab does when you shift and click and hold on a node? In FontLab this keeps the handles fixed and slides the nodes along the tangent as you move the mouse. &ndash;An extremely useful function.</p>

<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t really imagine most people would produce calligraphic gestures with a mouse, but even the prospect of creating points and then manipulating bézier curves between them with a mouse to arrive at a more or less faithful outline of a glyph previously seen in the mind&rsquo;s eye (or sketched on paper) seems daunting. My eyes &ndash; and my hands &ndash; certainly need a lot of training.</p>

It just takes time working with it. Playing a musical instument is a similar learning situation. Have you ever heard a child&rsquo;s first violin or trumpet lesson?
The thing you have to do is let go of the notion that it is like drawing on paper. Itis its own thing and can be learned if you allow yourself to accept it for what it is, not for what you long for it to be.</p>

<p>Really! And most of the reasons have already been mentioned above. I&rsquo;ll just add that, as I said, we use MM a lot. So going back and forth between FontLab and Illustrator would not only be nonsense but painful as well.

I use a text editor for feature code because the one built into FontLab is so goofy and unpredictable as to be useless. I guess they are not too careful when they code the Mac version.</p>

Why is that? I mean, I have no problem with Corel draw, but zooming beyond 1:1 with the upm, i.e where each pixel of the source em is more than 1 pixel on the screen, is like using a magnifying glass to see inside the underlying molecules of a steel punch. Why go there? Really, what do you use zooming for beyond 1:1? I&rsquo;m curious&hellip;</div>

<p>This happens when start points are involved, and is a bug in FontLab. You can avoid it by moving the start point, which only takes a couple of clicks. It would be better if they fixed it, but it is not a big problem.</p>
<p>But in any case it sounds like Corel Draw acts more like Fontographer and Fontlab in drawing, and not Illustrator&ndash;which is what the original question is about.</p>
<p>But the other essential feature of FontLab for me is having a preview panel so you can see your glyph next to others in the font as you draw and modify it. In <a href="http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/movies/">the film of Fred Goudy</a> drawing type, you see he draws between two other letters, and I bet that one way or another designers have been doing this since Jenson. I don&rsquo;t see how you can design a font without that.</p>
<p>I suppose you have a way to line up letters and do the same thing in a drawing-only program, but it sounds cumbersome to me.</p>
<p>And as James notes, if you want to use Multiple Master technology, just forget about a drawing-only program.</p>

<p>I am certainly not a pro, but I might as well vent my frustration here about what I have to deal with. Because I am currently serving in the army, there&rsquo;s only one machine I have access to during the week that I can use for font design. It&rsquo;s an ancient laptop from when Windows XP was first introduced, which is pretty much dedicated to Fontlab and music playing. I do most of my work with the touchpad and keyboard built into the laptop, on the 1024x768 resolution screen. It&rsquo;s a huge improvement when I get home on the weekends and can work on my home computer, which comes with a mouse and a slightly bigger screen, but I must confess I can&rsquo;t get myself to do much font design work on the weekends.</p>
<p>That said, I do 100% of my work in Fontlab; I draw directly on screen, although I get ideas from doodling on paper (mostly at work) with pen and pencil. Another caveat: I&rsquo;ve never completed a font, and the half a dozen fonts I have in production have mostly not progressed beyond the drawing stage. So I can only judge Fontlab&rsquo;s drawing capabilities.</p>
<p>I find Fontlab&rsquo;s drawing tools far easier to work with than Illustrator&rsquo;s, and I first used the latter at least 9 years ago. For this reason, I have used Fontlab to create outlines for simple lettering work that I could then import to Illustrator.</p>

<p>Dennis, you appeared to find the claim of 400,000% zoom ludicrous, so I was merely backing up my statement with visual proof. I agree with you that it may be excessive for drawing glyphs. My real gripe is that FontLab&rsquo;s zoom capabilities are a little stingy, e.g.:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/fl_max_3835.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Above is the maximum zoom level available from Fontlab; below is the same glyph in DTL Fontmaster Bezier Master, two levels short of maximum&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/dtl_nearmax_5816.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>With FL, it isn&rsquo;t readily apparent that the lower node in the DTL example isn&rsquo;t smooth, while that fact was apparent with DTL and was corrected. Moral of the story: Fontlab, we&rsquo;d like more zoom, please.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the node in your example seems to be unnecessary. You should keep the number of nodes a low as possible in order to keep the contour smooth.</p>
<p>The fact that FL sometimes does not recognise or even produces unsmooth nodes has nothing to do with zoom levels. Moral of my story: Fontlab, keep smooth nodes smooth at all times, please. Meaning, for instance, that when constraining the angle of the BCP by holding shift this should not be constrained to the previous angle of that BCP but the angle of the opposite BCP/line segment.</p>

<p>There are some good reasons to put a node at the middle of an &ldquo;s&rdquo; curve.
It does give a little bit better control of the shape, and I believe there is also some rendering/hinting/whatever technical-thingy benefit.</p>

<p>Sweet lord, that annoys the sh!t out of me too!</p>
<p>I like Illustrator&rsquo;s Bezier tool WAAAAAAY better than FontLab&rsquo;s— BUT vector editing in Illustrator just plain sucks. I would prefer to use FontLab exclusively, but I think FontLab&rsquo;s Pathfinder-esque features are very counterintuitive and don&rsquo;t work very well. They both have their flaws.</p>

<p>My experience is like Carl&rsquo;s. If you go to View/Zoom the closest zoom seems to be 1 unit = 4 pixels. I  usually just do keyboard +, which gives me the zoom tool, and I seem to get as close as I need to with that.</p>

<p>This happens when you select and delete the first (blue) node. This can be avoided by deleting the node by left-right clicking. No idea if something comparable can be done on the mac.</p>
<p>FL&rsquo;s node deletion is in fact very poor, improving this is on top of my wish list for future versions.</p>

<p>I have one, but I don&rsquo;t use it for drawing fonts much. I know that Jean François Porchez uses one almost exclusively.</p>
<p>I used to do most of my drawing in Illustrator back when I used Fontographer. I was more comfortable with the tools in Illustrator and Fontographer had an easy way to import art using copy and paste.</p>
<p>A couple years ago I switched completely over to using FontLab. I think the drawing tools work great for drawing letters (with a mouse). I don&rsquo;t use the pen tool, though. It&rsquo;s a little wonky. Or maybe I just haven&rsquo;t figured it out. Mainly I place nodes using the corner tool&ndash;connect the dot fashion. After this, I convert the nodes and lines to curves and smooth points as needed. I also use the rectangle and oval tools to lay down basic shapes and then tweak them as needed.</p>
<p>In some cases, I sketch letters on paper first. But I don&rsquo;t do tight sketches. The main purpose of the sketch is to capture the gesture and proportions of the letter. It is much faster to clean up in the computer than on paper.</p>
<p>No matter what software or input device I use, my most reliable tools are my hands and eyes.</p>

<p>I agree. And the second sentence there is why I&rsquo;m not terribly thrilled about using FontLab&rsquo;s drawing tools exclusively. I should be able to define my curves and lines <em>as I&rsquo;m drawing</em>. Sometimes I think the line/curve conversion stuff wastes so much time.</p>
<p>About zooming&hellip;I have zoomed in as far as possible in FontLab, and trust me&hellip;it ain&rsquo;t enough sometimes. In my case, I&rsquo;m not editing vectors drawn directly into FontLab. I&rsquo;m editing handdrawn ink that was converted to vectors, which means— <strong>a lot more points</strong>. Is there a feature in preferences I&rsquo;m missing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scale your Illustrator art so that 1 point corresponds to 1 em unit (i.e., if your target cap height is 700 em units, make your caps in Illustrator 700 points tall). Move the Illustrator ruler zero point to the origin point of the character art you want to copy. Copy from Illustrator, paste in FL. Simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing you want to avoid is scaling your paths <em>after</em> you paste them into FontLab, especially scaling up. Make sure they are the right scale in Illustrator before copying.</p>

A little unnecessary history, I have been sketching fonts since elementary school and only in the recent years have I consciously started to pursue typography as a viable part of my career. So much so, that for birthdays and anniversaries I request books on font/character design and history rather than the assumed flowers and jewelry. So, any suggestions for your favorite references would be great.</p>

<p>I am a production manager and in-house designer for a custom sign company working with large-scale graphics. So, even though magazine and web based design will never require that level of detailed attention to each node and bezier curve I do respect and want to thank the type designers who are aware of it. When you escape the parameters of points and scale to feet/meters that node is no longer invisible.</p>
