  University of Applied Sciences, from Kouvola, Finland. We are making our own student
  magazine as a school project and the subject of the magazine will be about graphic
  design. The magazine will also be published in the internet. (We'll announce it
  later.)\r\n\r\nWe have chosen typography in movies as our subject for the magazine.\r\n\r\nWe
  would like to find some people, who are somehow involved with typography in movies;
  whether you're very enthusiastic about it or even working with typography in movies
  to interview. We'd hope to learn more about this subject through your views and
  opinions. It would also be interesting to hear about your work or projects.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!\r\n\r\nFor further information and questions about the interview;
  you can contact us by sending email to:\r\n\r\njohanna.kuusisto@student.kyamk.fi"

  body: "Yves and Mark are right on. And if you're going to cover subtitling get in
    touch with Joe Clark - although I don't agree with all his opinions, he's pretty
    well-informed on the topic (just don't let his character get in the way).\r\n\r\nBTW
    make sure you talk about the making of the movie Avatar, where they paid US$100,000
    to have a language invented, but then used Papyrus!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    he doesn't reply, do you have some other \"movie typophiles\" in mind (who have
    knowledge in the topic)?\r\n\r\nAnd Avatar is a definite addition to our text,
    since our main text is going to be about \"Good and Bad Typography in Movies\"!"
