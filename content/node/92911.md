  those too young to remember, dry transfer letters were often used by designers in
  the days before desktop publishing, mainly for creating mockups, adding artwork,
  and occasionally on the final artwork itself (for example on a temporary sign).

    Colin Brignall and Dave Farey:\r\nhttp://river-valley.tv/letraset-the-liberated-letter/\r\n\r\nI
    used Letraset type from its earliest days (at my parents\u2019 architectural practice)
    thru art school and then as a professional graphic designer. I stopped using it
    when I became an art director and got all my type from type houses; that would
    be around 1979. But I continued to use their other products, especially markers
    and paper, for comps. Then c.1990 I bought some of their fonts on \uFB02oppies.\r\n\r\nI
    submitted Letraset a lot of proposals for typeface designs in the 1970s and 80s,
    but they rejected them all.\r\nThanks goodness for the Mac and Fontographer!"

  body: "I was a regular \"dry transfer\" type user starting in high school in the
    early seventies pretty much up until PostScript fonts came along. Letraset was
    by far the best, but if I need a typeface they didn't carry, I sometimes used
    Chartpak, Formatt, Mecanorma, Zipatone, Prestype, and Artype (rarely). \r\n\r\nI
    first encountered it when a friend of my dad's, who was the in-house designer
    where he worked, gave me some rub-down type sheets for me to use on model cars
    when I was about 12. I still remember what the typefaces were: Times Bold, Microgramma,
    Old Bowery, and Jim Crow. It was very bad stuff, almost like it was on wax paper.
    No spacing guides. Don't recall the brand.\r\n\r\nThe first kind I actually bought
    was Prestype. Terrible, cheap stuff, bought at a stationery store for use on my
    high school newspaper. Seemed like you could only get Caslon and Futura Bold.
    They also carried some Letraset sheets--Helvetica Medium, mostly in large sizes.
    $2.50 per sheet--expensive! I made the mistake of using a ballpoint pen to rub
    down the Letraset, resulting in a warped carrier sheet and cracked letters.\r\n\r\nSomehow
    I got hold of a Chartpak catalog and discovered Bookman Swash, Windsor Bold and
    \"Made By ITC\" faces like Avant Garde, Serif Gothic, and Busorama. I got my dad
    to drive me 35 miles to the nearest art supply store to buy some \"Velvet Touch\"
    Chartpak sheets.\r\n\r\nI wonder how many other type designers (or graphic designers,
    for that matter) in my generation got their first taste of type with rub down
    lettering. I bet it's a lot."

    think my first use of it was in high school, making some graphics for a science
    project. Then in college a lot of us used it for our design projects as that was
    before desktop publishing and we couldn't afford professional typesetting. Once
    I turned pro I used it less often, but it still came in handy sometimes, especially
    for putting mockup type on colored surfaces or photos. \r\n\r\nI kept my big folder
    full of transfer sheets for many years \u2014 fonts, rules, registration marks,
    etc. Never used it anymore but hated to discard it, but I finally tossed it away
    just a few years ago.  "

  body: My first use was in the early 1960s in design school, soon after it was put
    on the market.  PressType was the first one I used.  It was sneered at back then
    but caught on quickly after better typefaces and quality came about--mostly by
    Letraset.  My design school was Carnegie Mellon University.  We had a very well
    equipped type lab run by Jack Stauffacher so we just hand set most of our work
    in foundry type. While I originally only used transfer type for layouts, after
    a few years, I used it for camera-ready art as well.  It was way cheaper than
    Typositor output.

  body: "In the early 1970s I worked at Charrette, the art supply store based in Cambridge,
    Massachusetts, at that time the largest reseller of Letraset in the world. As
    someone already passionate about type, I took a special interest in this product
    (and in Chartpak and Normatype, which we also sold) and in 1975 had the enormous
    good fortune to be sent on a trip to England to visit Letraset, Chartpak, Winsor
    and Newton (paints, brushes), and Blundell Harling (measurement tools such as
    scale rulers). What astonished me about the Letraset plant was the fanatical cleanliness
    of the place. (And by hilarious contrast, parts of the W & N plant seemed almost
    mediaeval!) The sheets were produced on what was basically a web press, with an
    endless roll of polyethylene being spooled into an area with a very acurate silkscreening
    rig, then sent onward to be waxed overall. \r\n\r\nI began using Letraset in my
    architect dad's office in the 1960s, then later as a graphic designer in the 1970
    used it a lot. One could often get far better spacing in titles and headlines
    doing this oneself with Letraset rather than buying Typositor output from someone
    who was generally working in tight-no-touch spacing mode. Wish I had a nickel
    for every line of Typositor type \u2014 allegedly ready to go \u2014 that I had
    to wax and then cut apart to respace letter by letter . . .\r\n\r\nWhat's amazing
    is that I still have many, many sheets of Letraset, stored in boxes marked Serif,
    Sans, Decorative, and Symbols, and they are still usable, even though the newest
    ones probably date from 1980. The wax doesn't hold as well as it once did, and
    the burnishing tends to make the polyethylene warp and wave a bit more, but I
    think it is a testimony to the extremely high manufacturing standards of Letraset
    that these objects are still viable forty years later. I doubt very much that
    Presstype would still be that way. Certainly Normatype had a tendency to separate
    from the backing sheet even in the days when it was freshly-manufactured.  "
