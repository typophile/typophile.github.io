  body: "Old English and Cloister Black would be generic bases for recreating this
    look:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/cloister-black-ct/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/old-english/\r\n\r\nYour
    sample, though has an additional spur on the left vertical of the M, as well as
    embellishments on both capital letters.\r\n\r\nThe closest digital match I could
    find is a blackletter by Font Mesa, but it only comes in an italic:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/spanish-main/\r\n\r\nIt
    is, however, based on a metal font by MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan Co, Philadelphia,
    and there was a condensed/upright version that is a dead on match to your sample
    (though yours has lost the fine line details). Unfortunately, I haven't found
    a digital version of it (this sample dates from 1892):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimensofprint00mackrich_0323_4502.jpg]"

    anywhere."

  body: "Good finds Kevin, with the MS&J Condensed Black No. 2 and Paul Lloyd's digital
    recreation as Plain Black. My files do not show who was the creator of MS&J Condensed
    Black No. 2. The sample image seems to be from Paul Lloyd's digital font.\r\nDon"
