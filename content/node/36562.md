  body: I read w-t-m (with the t obviously representing a cross), or E-t-E (with the
    Es being rotated on their sides). Besides the imagery of the cross, I'm not really
    sure what's going on...

  body: "Unfortunately, most people will probably read the '\u03C9' as a 'w' so it
    might be wise to use '\u03A9' instead. I also read \"wtm\". I'd start from scratch.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Forgive me for being blunt, but this isn't a logo for a youth group -- instead,
    it's a perfect one for a mortuary. So unless it's a Goth youth group...\r\n\r\nThe
    whole logo -- they static strokes and straight corners, the cross, the color theme
    -- symbolizes the complete opposite of what a \"youth group\" should represent."

  body: well, it's a christian youth group, so the cross at least fits (not that all
    christian things have to have a crosses in their logos)

    ... I forget sometimes that I majored in Classics ...\r\n\r\nit's a rough workup,
    but i'm wondering what folks think if it's a better direction:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpcukiah.org/images/omega_5.png"

  body: "That's somewhat better, but still way too static and serious.\r\n\r\nTry
    the following:\r\n\r\n1. Use livelier colors;\r\n2. Use less straight lines and
    angles, more curves;\r\n3. Use less serious, more dynamic fonts;\r\n4. Use less
    geometrical, more \"out of order\" placement.\r\n"

  body: "Because all of the text is at the same angle, the '\u03A9' is reading as
    a 'C' to me. Try rotating the word \"OMEGA\" so its baseline matches the '\u03A9'.\r\n\r\nWhat's
    the age group of the youth? There's a big difference between designing for kindergarteners
    and high schoolers.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: It's a high school youth group.  I'm going for the "I take myself very seriously
    because I'm a teenager and I skateboard and know everything" kind of feel.

  body: are you seeing that in the text part of it?  because i suppose i can see how
    you would see that, but it's a real stretch ... anyone else seeing this?  because
    i'm not ...

  body: "The last thing this world needs is another Christian/Youth Group \"look my
    \"T\" is actually a cross\" thing. For God's sake, please don't do that. It's
    so overplayed, cheesy, and cliche.\r\n\r\n(sorry, but this is a constant gripe
    for me).\r\n\r\nThat said, your second concept is worlds better.\r\n\r\nI also
    disagree with Henry. This doesn't need to be livelier, curvy, etc.\r\nThis is
    headed in a good direction. You may wish to refine the Omega Symbol. The bar on
    the \"M\" needs a lot of work. It is a little clumsy here. Maybe something a little
    sharper.\r\n\r\nI would also consider a different face for the text. You know
    what might work well with this is Klavika."

  body: "I like the second one too. It appears to be a head and torso (the omega and
    'M' together) which could represent one of these Christian youths.\r\nThe type
    I would definitely change however. Apart from this I like the new direction."
