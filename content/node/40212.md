  is no longer available and we are trying to discover which font was used to create
  the logo on our webpage - http://www.ronpaulblimp.com .\r\n\r\nwe're looking to
  find/purchase the font used in \"Ron Paul\", and i presume ALL CAPS of this font
  are used in the BLIMP logo itself.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nplease email me directly:
  \ bbc@infinitygames.com\r\n\r\nthanks a ton!"
