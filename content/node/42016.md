  body: "I am currently writing, in my spare time, \"CJKV Information Processing\"
    Second Edition. It is due out by year's end. I am using InDesign CS3. First Edition
    was done using FrameMaker, and was very table-heavy, with plenty of table footnotes.
    Anyway, I came up with a way to handle table footnotes in InDesign. To see the
    results, get the following PDF from Second Edition, which is the 13th page from
    Chapter 3 in progress: http://lundestudio.com/CJKV2E/ch3-p13.pdf\r\n\r\nHere is
    how I did it. I set up a new Cell Style called TableNotes. In it is defined a
    rule, that separates the table notes from the table proper. At first, I tried
    to make this a footer row, but when the table broke the page, the table notes
    would be repeated. So, I made this as the last row in the table proper. The line
    above, which is last row of the table proper, is made stick to the row for the
    table footnotes. To handle numbering, I set up two Paragraph styles: CellTableNote_Start
    and CellTableNote. The first table note of a table, of course, is tagged with
    the former. Subsequent ones are tagged with the latter. Even if there is more
    than one table note, it is a single table row, but with multiple lines. Of course,
    if the table has multiple columns, this row spans all of them. The table note
    references in the table proper are handled manually, but because each table is
    self-contained, it's not a big burden. Until InDesign handles references, this
    must be done. Anyway, this technique is working for me.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior
