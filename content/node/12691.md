body: "I have a client -- an egg farm -- that I am developing a display font for.
  Originally I offered them exclusivity for 1 year, with an option to renew.\r\n\r\nBut
  they want to buy the font outright.\r\n\r\nI'm kind of against this. For one thing,
  do they really need it? Secondly, could they afford it? Third, I've never sold a
  font through a foundry or MyFonts or whatever, so I'm kind of looking forward to
  trying it out.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? How much is a ballpark figure for selling a
  display typeface? I've heard the $5K figure but that seems high to me."

    situation selling through Myfonts, for instance, where your font would be marketed
    and put in front of the people's eyes ... and then times that by 10.
