  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Enjoy non-suicidal letter shape on your mobile / cellphone.  Why use a 
suicidal shape k/K on the 11th english language letter, see: 
<a href="http://Kalphabet.googlepages.com">http://Kalphabet.googlepages.com</a>, when you could use a non-suicidal 
letter shape alternative i.e. क/क in lower and upper cases?  [choose 
UTF-8 on your internet browser’s character encoding if you are unable 
to see the new shape]</p>
<p>That is exactly what I did by using Symbian S60 v5 operating system 
mobile / cellphone.  I had been searching for an easy font alteration 
on the mobile / cellphone in Britain.  I had searched Android 
operating system phones and there was either (1) rooting the phone 
which required some technical ability and also involved some risकs or 
(2) contracting or buying the expensive Samsung Galaxy S range or a 
few other Samsung models which has the font alteration capability. 
There was something also technical with option (2) as the Samsung 
mobiles / cellphones used Google Play / Android marकet and this 
involved certain technical abilities because I could not simply upload 
a .ttf font from the PC.</p>
<p>Thus I opted for a much easier solution and this was purchasing a 
cheap Symbian S60 v5 operating system mobile / cellphone when I learnt 
that alternating the font was easy and could be done by a newbie.  The 
mobile / cellphone for font alteration mentioned were:  Noकia 5800, 
5233, 5230 and 5235.  I only had to copy 4 times on the PC my chosen 
font containing the non-suicidal letter, i.e. the BBT font ( download 
it for example from here <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/BbtFont">http://www.archive.org/details/BbtFont</a> - 
choose Regular or Italic )  and then only change each file name to 
(note lower case / upper case file name letters) s60snr.ttf, 
s60ssb.ttf, s60tsb.ttf and S60ZDIGI.ttf.</p>
<p>Then I either had to: 
(1) on a Memory Card create &lsquo;Resource&rsquo; named folder and in it the 
&lsquo;Fonts&rsquo; named folder and put the s60snr.ttf, s60ssb.ttf, s60tsb.ttf 
and S60ZDIGI.ttf files there - restart the phone.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>(2)  connect the mobile / cellphone to the PC in Mass Storage Mode, 
search for the &lsquo;Resource&rsquo; named folder in the internal mobile / 
cellphone file system and in it the &lsquo;Fonts&rsquo; named folder and if there 
was not one there - create the &lsquo;Fonts&rsquo; folder.  Transfer the 
s60snr.ttf, s60ssb.ttf, s60tsb.ttf and S60ZDIGI.ttf to the &lsquo;Fonts&rsquo; 
named folder.  Restart the mobile / cellphone.</p>
<p>I chose this method (1).  I found the process easy and really prefer 
the non-suicidal letter shape on the mobile / cellphone.  The only 
thing that I as a newbie have not been able to do is alter the default 
Noकia image at booting though I have put the non-suicidal letter 
sticकer (see post mentioning sticकerbooक) on the Noकia name which is 
on the phone case front and put blanक sticकers on the Noकia name which 
is on the reverse and on the battery due to larger size sticकer 
unavailability and also it was convenient.</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever modify our alphabet in this way - because the rationale is simply unpersuasive to that great majority of Latin alphabet users who are not of the Hindu faith - I could see how the goal might be achieved through a more subtle approach.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Armenian alphabet has no &ldquo;suicidal&rdquo; shapes of this type in it. And it has room - used in Eastern Armenian - for the extra consonant sounds found in Chinese (particularly in the Shanghai dialect, where English b, d, and g are also present)&hellip; and in Sanskrit. So this alphabet could be recommended on the more apparently rational grounds of promoting global unity and world peace.</p>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t all speak the same language, at least we can share the same typewriters.</p>

As I understand this, the OP broke away from the Hare Krishna movement as an individual because he lacked confidence in its new leadership after the death of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.</p>
<p>The Hare Krishna movement, or ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) is, basically, a denomination of Hinduism or a faith organization within that religion. (I had a binaural test record that referred to them as &ldquo;Buddhists&rdquo;, so apparently some confusion about Eastern religions exists.)</p>
<p>On his web page, he explains that an ancient battle between Gods and demons took place at the junction of several rivers; and that this event was so significant that the shape of that junction of rivers provokes suicidal thoughts in people. This involves an invisible river, called the Saraswati, but apparently the tradition of people in India committing suicide at a place of pilgrimage in Allahabad was real enough.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My favourite part of the whole thing is that one of the rivers creating this suicidal shape is <em>invisible.</em> We could perhaps ease Javascript&rsquo;s concerns by saying that the letter K is actually made up of four strokes, one of which is invisible, so its visible shape is not representative of its true shape, and hence its true (non-suicidal) meaning.</p>
<p>Hrant, did you take money for that job?</p>
<p>BTW, if you enjoy this, don&rsquo;t miss <a href="http://typophile.com/node/99378">this</a>.</p>
<p>I find it alternatively delightfully imaginative and depressingly stupid that all this time after the development of philology, palaeography and systematic linguistics people are still inclined to assign <em>magical</em> significance to the mundane phenomena of of writing. Writing is wonderful, but because it is made by this animal called human, not because it reveals occult knowledge or works as sympathetic magic on the psyche.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">But I&rsquo;ve been insistent that Devanagari is so different from Latin that it maկes no sense to intermix letters from those scripts. Gujarati, as it uses disconnected letters, would be a better choice; and Armenian is better yet, as it is different enough so as to have a letter with different topology for the consonant in question, and yet related enough so that it can be unified in design.</div>
