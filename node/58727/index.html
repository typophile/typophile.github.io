  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So without giving any information about the project this logo is for, I'm looking for some feedback. 
-What would you guess this logo represents?
-How does it make you feel?
-List some adjectives to describe it

The logo is still far from finished but we're struggling with a font choice. Once I get some idea of how other people are viewing it I'll let you know what feeling I'm aiming for and hopefully some of you will have some more font suggestions.

Thanks so much!

EDIT: Before I get comments about the typesetting...I don't own this font yet so these are mockups using screen captures. The type needs a lot of work that will come later.

		<div class="commentbody">I do have some difficulty with the whole and a few elements, but I understand you need feedback on the 'feeling' departement.

I just can't get past the fight that is being fought between the 'T' (the stem) and the rest of the tree (leaves. Why not one color?).
They both are fighting for attention, they both don't get what the deserve. Besides that the stem is very wide and bold, the hands - however - are tiny. I don't like this.
The hands are lost.

The whole is a bit dull, not vivid.
The font doesn't feel right.

In the distant I can see somewhat of a fairytail, but not a nice one.

It is dark, especially the lonely hands crying out for help.
It doesn't give me a good feeling.

But then again ... ten people ... ten opinions.
Hope this helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The colors are harmonious an a have a soft natural feel.

The relationships of the images and text leave me confused. The work is "Take," but the hand is in an asking position, as in, "Please give me something," as opposed to, "Please take something (a burden, I'm guessing) from me." 

The tree and "taking" makes me think of the giving tree which again creates a conflict. As a symbol, the tree is a source not a receiver. With the hands on it, it seems like the tree needs something.

A radial arrangement of the hands suggests a group of people coming together. But I'm not sure why there are three groups of people, or why these groups are on the tree.</div>

Instead of a T you should try to make the stem of the tree an arm + hand instead. 
Therefore removing all the other hands from the leaves.</div>
