    interesting. Good work, I like it!"

  body: Thanks! Due to the little inclination the italic needed to be fundamentally
    different than the roman.

    not) emerging trend* of making the various\r\nstyles obviously different, like
    Yanone and Hasebe have\r\nbeen professing.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/88931\r\n\r\nBut
    what caused you to make the Italic slant so gentle?\r\n(I'm being curious, not
    critical, since I actually like it.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Ha, Hrant!\r\nIt may well be, that this was partly your fault :-) Sometime
    around here you were talking about only slightly slanting italics. That could
    have been one of the reasons to try this approach. But the main reason was that
    i intended to make the overall widths of the four weights the same. With only
    a gentle slant this was the best way to do it. But then other \u203Acursive\u2039
    elements were needed to make the italic work as a companion and to be a convincing
    type for emphasis in running text."

    the thought of making an Armenian alphabet for Mantika Sans, too. But so far i
    haven\u2019t found the time for doing so."
