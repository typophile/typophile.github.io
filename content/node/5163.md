body: We have a contract to prevent unauthorized access to certain fonts, and from
  what I&#39;ve seen on this forum and other sites, it is possible for hackers or
  pirates to extract embedded font metrics from pdf files -- which would mean we couldn&#39;t
  distribute pdf&#39;s.  Assuming we want the folks that receive pdf&#39;s to be able
  to view and print them as designed -- is there a way to prevent such access, without
  locking down the whole pdf?

  body: Unfortunately the only avenue is to buy fonts from vendors who sell embedding
    rights. Some fonts &#40;Adobe for example&#41; are embeddable off-the-shelf. Some
    foundries &#40;such as Emigre&#41; offer embedding licenses for a price. To stay
    legal you just need to choose fonts that allow it. But if a restrictive foundry
    has a font that you Simply Must Use, do try contacting them and making them an
    offer. They will listen, and you might arrive at a deal.
