body: "Hello all - \r\n\r\nMostly for the thrill of the hunt, I'm looking to identify
  the typeface used as display type in the early rulebooks for the Traveller role-playing
  game from the late 1970s and early 1980s. After a few years the display face changed
  to Optima, and the differences were very slight. In fact, there are examples where
  the two are mixed, with an old logo and new Optima type above it.\r\n\r\nOverall,
  the face is extremely similar to Optima in form of almost all letters and punctuation
  I've seen, oblique and roman both. The oblique form is more upright than Optima's
  though, and some letters like F and L may be more condensed. \r\n\r\nThe mystery
  face generally has softer edges and is less delicate, with less cupped terminals.
  Actually, it often tends to look like a badly worn letterpress font of Optima, and
  maybe that's where the maker started from. But there are a few letters that are
  quite distinct in form. The most obvious is A, which has its righthand stroke continued
  above its lefthand one. Its crossbar is also high. It's distinctive, and is one
  of the reasons I want to find this face, which otherwise looks like a fairly mediocre
  knockoff of Optima.\r\n\r\nHere's a bit of the logo in mystery face and in Optima
  for comparison of oblique caps, including the A:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mystery-TRA-sm_6489.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/optima-TRA-sm_5548.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  should note that the A is this same shape in plain roman, too, not just in the oblique
  form.\r\n\r\nThe other differences I've noticed are \r\n\r\n1) the apostrophe (or
  single quote), which is a sharp triangle in the mystery face, unlike the rounded
  pinball-flipper shape in Optima:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mystery-apostrophe_5827.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/optima-apostrophe_4565.jpg]\r\n(Try
  to ignore the fact that the Optima sample is a heavier weight - when they're the
  same weight, most letters are nearly identical.)\r\n\r\n&\r\n2) the y, which has
  a curved tail in the mystery face, unlike the sharp triangular end in Optima:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mystery-ry_5733.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/optima-ry_6581.jpg]\r\n\r\nOther
  than that, differences are subtle to non-existent within the letters I've been able
  to compare. I haven't found a Q or a J to compare anywhere, nor most non-alphanumerics.
  1, 4, question mark and comma do match Optima quite well.\r\n\r\nThe front page
  of two books, with mystery and Optima (from which the TRA samples above were taken),
  can be seen [[http://www.davidmbowman.com/RCB/Traveller/type/TypeComparison1.jpg|here]].
  I can scan other samples if anyone wants other specific letters, but as I said,
  I haven't found any others that aren't virtually identical to Optima. \r\n\r\nDid
  someone take some Optima and add a new A and y, and change, basically, nothing else?
  Anyone know what they called it? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your attention and
  help!"

  body: "No replies yet. I've got a bit more information. I actually contacted the
    game designer, who says that Optima was specified from the beginning. This means
    either the printer said \"oh, this one's close enough,\" or the printer had a
    face that was called Optima, but wasn't real Optima. I expect it's the latter,
    because the text face of these early books is an odd, corrupted form of Univers,
    with the e and a couple of other letters much too condensed for the rest of the
    face. When the display face becomes real Optima in later books and printings,
    the text becomes real Univers.\r\n\r\nI have also found examples of both Q and
    J. J is more or less identical to Optima. Q is quite different from Optima, with
    the tail a straight bar crossing from inside the bowl to well below the line at
    about a 45 degree angle. (I can scan if anyone's interested.)\r\n\r\nIf I'm right
    about the face, though, probably the only hope of finding it would be in the catalogue
    of whatever company sold the font, back in the '70s. I can always hope, though..."

  body: "Sorry I don't have enough time to write up more details and provide source
    files, but Optima had many licensed and unlicensed variants during the 1960s-1980s.\r\n\r\nDuring
    that time many printers and designers used type output from multiple sources;
    hot-metal (often resized by camera), press-type, IBM Selectric, photo-headline,
    phototype, and closer to the eighties - CRT typesetters and the first generation
    digital imagesetters.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that optical adjustments were made
    by type designers and type foundries to visually optimize the font when used for
    text versus headlines, you often saw these variants within typefaces at different
    sizes.\r\n\r\nSo just multiply the variables -- many licensed/un-licensed versions
    of Optima x display/text versions x various technology = design variants.\r\n\r\nI
    know of at least six Optima \"versions\" I used during that time.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Norbert. This is pretty much as I expected. Probably the main logo
    (from which the `TRA' above is taken) was scaled up by camera - it would fit with
    its look. \r\n\r\nThese are not expensively designed or printed books, so the
    designers were not going to great lengths with tailoring the typeface for them,
    I'm certain. Presumably it's a version (licensed or not) of Optima that was floating
    around. \r\n\r\nI was hoping that someone would be able to pinpoint the actual
    variant, based on that distinctive A especially, and tell me where it came from.
    But I know it's a longshot."

    have the shady stuff. Nor have I seen any reference to legitimate, licensed variants
    of Optima. But my resources are few.\r\n"

  body: I helped launch CG Omega when I was at Compugraphic/Agfa. This was preceded
    by the infamous "Oracle" version of Optima made during early days of Compugraphic,
    and before the font library became "legitimate" during Agfa ownership.

  body: "Sorry I didn't catch this thread earlier. I recognized this right away. It's
    Chelmsford, the clone of Optima that AM (Addressograph Multigraph) had for their
    typesetting equipment. I always hated what they did to poor Optima, making seemingly
    random and pointless changes to a few letters, apparently to avoid being accused
    of font piracy. I still cringe every time I see it--which isn't often anymore,
    but happens. There is a trucking company that still uses it, so I see it whizz
    by on the freeway now and then.\r\n\r\nAM had the oddest taste in naming their
    knock-offs: Melior was called Mallard; Helvetica was called Megaron. A duck and
    what sounds like something from a Japanese monster movie. And Chelmsford--a British-sounding
    name for a typeface by a German designer inspired by Italian stone-carved letters.
    Brilliant."

    typesetters had, all with different names for similar (based on the same) typefaces!
    It took a lot of sleuthing then too...

    I was hoping for hereabouts. I'll have to see if I can dig up a full specimen
    sheet of AM Chelmsford. I doubt anyone's digitized it - there wouldn't be much
    point. It is a rather poor copy, and mostly pointless, but that A I do find interestingly
    done, and quite distinctive, and it's solidly stamped into my consciousness as
    part of the logo for the game, and therefore a part of my adolescence... \r\n\r\nThanks,
    Mark (and everyone). Glad I found this place to ask."
