body: One of my clients is wanting to have her handwriting converted to a font but
  this is not something I do. I would just need a basic set. If anyone is interested
  please let me know rates and timeline. You may write to me directly at amanda@wraycodesign.com
  and/or post examples here.

  body: "I was kind of semi-serious. These chaps seem to be best of a 'bad' bunch.
    One thing they've offered for a while is contextual OpenType fonts which does
    put them a cut above the rest. I had them convert a friends handwriting as a wedding
    gift a few years back and the result seemed pretty fair (for $99) - to the extent
    that whenever I get handwritten cards from her I catch myself thinking 'I know
    that font'. \r\n\r\nWe also licensed a few fonts for them for use in localized
    Flash based help tutorials for German and Italian Tablet PC - we needed handwriting
    that looked authentic for these countries. Again fonts were okay and usable in
    these tutorials.\r\n\r\nWe've also been badgering them for a while on fixing validator
    errors in their fonts so quality may have improved. \r\n\r\nAn alternative might
    be the cut-down FontLab product (can't recall the name), or of course a real designer,
    but I can't help but think that life's too short for talented people to be working
    on stuff like this ;-) \r\n\r\nOh one more if you have access to a Tablet PC...
    http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/tabletpc.mspx scroll down
    to \"My Font Tool for Tablet PC\" Results are not exactly good but it's free.\r\n\r\nSi\r\n\r\n

    as the company/person creating the font may retain rights to the font - which

    you get back is covered by a license (so you can't share it with all your mates)

    body: "Vletter, yes, that is the old Signature Software company. They\r\nstarted
      out by placing ads in airline magazines for 100 dollar custom\r\nhandwriting
      jobs. Thousands of business guys fell for it.\r\nSo, I decided to check it out
      and shelled out 100 dollars.\r\nI opened the PostScript font (which is no doubt
      illegal--hence my\r\nimmense pleasure), and saw that each character was represented
      four\r\ntimes. Each time the font was called upon to produce that character,\r\nit
      would take the next one, rotating through the four glyphs.\r\nThat, in my opinion,
      is not \"context sensitive\". It is not in the\r\nspirit of OpenType ligatures,
      for example. The sales hype\r\nthat accompanied this was just incredible--they
      called it \"magic\".\r\nMaybe they could have changed between 1999 and now,
      but the samples\r\non their web page (look at \"subsystems\") seem to indicate
      that\r\nthey are still rotating through their glyphs. Any decent computer\r\nscience
      graduate can do infinitely better than that.\r\nIt is disappointing to see that
      Microsoft is aligning itself\r\nwith such a company. \r\n\r\nCreating real-looking
      handwriting is *very very* difficult. No one\r\nhas done it to date--it is one
      of those enormous challenges ahead\r\nof us--I have dabbled in it myself, but
      had to give up because\r\nI needed to do other things to make a living. Lots
      of things\r\nare important: ductus, stress, style of pen, inertia (and thus,\r\ndifferential
      equations), connectivity, ligatures, and so forth.\r\nThe best attempt I had
      was when I wrote 1600 glyphs with an\r\nelectronic pen, including all the pairs
      and triples of characters\r\nthat were most common in Shakespeare's work. But
      it's not enough--\r\nthere is no program on earth (yet) that can really \"learn\"
      how\r\na writer moves his/her hand. Most experts in this area work in\r\nElectrical
      Engineering departments, by the way--they are familiar\r\nwith signal processing
      and related things. Anyway, it's going\r\nto take another decade at least to
      get something decent.\r\nVletter is just a temporary cure for the cold.\r\n\r\nAll
      the best to everyone,\r\n\r\nLuc"

    \r\n\r\nYes they changed their name - apparently there were four or five other
    companies using the same name - it's kind of snappy.\r\n\r\n> opened the PostScript
    font \r\n\r\nMight be more sensible to open the OpenType font in FL and take a
    gander at their OTL tables. \r\n\r\n>which is no doubt illegal\r\n\r\n...in the
    name of scientific study and research I'm sure no one would object.\r\n\r\n>hence
    my immense pleasure\r\n\r\n...now that's a little bit sad ;-)\r\n\r\n>Any decent
    computer science graduate can do infinitely better than that.\r\n\r\n...and mass
    produce thousands of fonts for less than $100 each? I wonder why they've not bothered?
    I think I pointed out that the font I had made was not top quality, but I didn't
    feel cheated out of my $100. You get what you pay for.\r\n\r\n>It is disappointing
    to see that Microsoft is aligning itself with such a company. \r\n\r\nIf by aligning
    you mean \"licensing a couple of fonts for a Flash demo and nagging them to fix
    their bad fonts\" then you'd be right. \r\n\r\nI'd agree that making 100% convincing
    handwriting is probably impossible. Most of the people on this list can spot fake
    handwriting a mile off. But looking at the wide-spread use of VLetter's fonts
    and other handwriting fonts in direct-mail, advertising etc., seems as if you
    can fool most of the people most of the time.\r\n\r\nI assume the electrical engineers
    are not in the direct-mail biz. Why are they interested in this? What's the application
    of this work?\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n\r\n"
