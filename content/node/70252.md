body: "I need to create a bunch of Word templates that use 'standard' PC fonts (like...Times,
  Cambria, etc. etc. that would be found on most PCs.) My non-profit client runs a
  conference that takes place in different cities every year; the documents are accessed
  by all the staff members, drafted and printed out just days before the conference
  starts, using rental and clients' PC computers set up in a hotel room-turned-office.
  Also, the hired local staff members (who change from year-to-year) sometimes bring
  their own personal laptops--who knows how old--further reducing the number of lowest
  common denominator fonts that can be used.\r\n\r\nThe workshop's logo is attached,
  below. I think the sans serif font is Interstate light, and the 'th' is Caslon 540
  italic.\r\n\r\nUp until now, they've been using Verdana (!) as a default bold header,
  and TImes New Roman as the body copy for documents, because those are the common
  fonts that all the computers are sure to have.\r\n\r\nAre there any other 'lowest
  common denominator' fonts that would pair well (or better) with this logo? I especially
  want to find a more elegant-but-commonly-used sans serif--I just don't know the
  PC font system so well.\r\n\r\nFor background info, the workshop attracts participants
  who are politicians, defense ministers, ambassadors, etc etc (= a pretty conservative
  crowd, so classic fonts, including new classics, are what I'm looking for...)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJean"
