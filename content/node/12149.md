  its own wiki, and now it does! hoorah! i've had some fun updating some entries thus
  far, but i've noticed that the wiki can be hard to get around in if the authors
  of articles forget to leave out a navigation line at the head of the article. I
  propose that we copy the navigation line that can be found at the begining of the
  page for designers so that the top of the page reads something like this for each
  article:\r\n<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Designers]] : Gerald Giampa</strong>\r\nthis
  makes it easier to navigate so that you don't have to back your browser out of an
  article to get back to the indicies and you don't have to go up top to the typowiki
  link and then click on the indices link, anyway... it just makes things easier.
  Help keep our wiki clean!"

    split unto two lines the superscript 'w' stays on the top line and the word will
    have a small space to the right of it where the superscript 'w' should have been.

    that's an IE quirk (gosh, is that even possible?).\r\n\r\nPaul, that's a great
    idea, and if I have time, I'll go back and clean up the entries I've made so far
    to conform to your standard. It's kind of a mystery to me what the categories
    we're entering with our entries are used for.\r\n\r\nAlso, I sure hope we're going
    to have revision histories available for wiki entries at some point. They're extremely
    useful on the <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a>."

    until it does you often have to code for it since so many people use the browser."

    to all users. This is on our list of to-do's so you can rollback any given wiki
    entry to see what revisions have happened to it, and who made them.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the breadcrumb (Wiki > Designers > Gerald Giampa) it's my understanding that
    this is not standard navigation for a wiki, which tends to be a little more free-form.
    Adding a series of Indices is our little twist to allow the wiki to take the place
    of the (former) Open Directory Project. No use keeping both around with all that
    the Wiki is capable of."

    like typowiki will make it much easier to understand when an unfamiliar term comes
    along :)\r\n\r\nThe automation would be a good feature to add, if not it is not
    much effort to do it manually, but yeah I see where that could perhaps not be

    this feeling that the DB queries wouldn't actually be all that slow, because their
    high frequency and relative small size of the DB should ensure they're cached
    and would always get served out of RAM. However, I know almost nothing about your
    particular setup.\r\n\r\nAs I've said before, I expect the typowiki to seriously
    rock. The community we have here has ideal characteristics for maintaining a wiki:
    expertise, mutual respect, and passion. Thanks again for putting it online!"

  body: 'well it''s been what, 6 months? and it seems more and more people are getting
    comfortable with using the [[typowiki]], and i love it. but it can always be improved
    upon. I just wanted to bump this thread so that it gets renewed attention. Just
    to simply restate my original sentiment, let''s try to make the wiki as navigable
    as possible by leaving bread crumbs (see above). At the very least, i think linking
    back to the Indices page at the top of each article is a good idea, with complete
    strings of breadcrumbs being preferable. As moderator with responsiblity for the
    wiki, i try to make sure that these are there, but i can''t go back and check
    all of the almost 1000 articles now. So, if you come across a page that you see
    needs to be enhanced, either change things yourself (c''mon, get yer feet dirty!)
    or bring issues to my attention. thanks for your attention and all your contributions
    to the wiki. i think it''s beginning to become a good resource for research and
    answering questions, but we''re not even close to scratching the surface of its
    potential. let''s keep up the good work and i''m sure it''ll get there in time. '

    look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;!&#45;&#45; 12/22/06 added external
