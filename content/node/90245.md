  but I realize I might need a font thats just a little bit bolder. I don't seem to
  be able to find the same thing but just a  bit bolder. The other variations of chalet
  don't have the curves and raffinement of the paris one. Any suggestions ? Thanks."

    does really depend a lot on the exact letters your logo contains.  In a pinch
    you can add a tiny bit of stroke or offset and then tweak the cuts that fill in.  '

  body: "> I wish there was an in between.\r\n\r\nFontLab can interpolate between
    (and even extrapolate from) two\r\nweights of a typeface with good results. Of
    course producing an\r\nentire font in this way would most probably violate the
    House\r\nIndustries license agreement; but taking two EPSs of a handful\r\nof
    glyphs, interpolating those and producing a new intermediate\r\nEPS is most probably
    OK. If you go this route you know who to\r\nask for help.  :-)  That's assuming
    the House boys themselves\r\ndon't want to do it for you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
