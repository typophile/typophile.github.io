So Neue Helvetica is the operating system font that replaces Lucida Grande. Let’s hope the Apple Helvetica variant has glyph compatibility with Lucida Grande (similarly extended) and is properly hinted. 

Oh and it would be really nice if Apple made some architectural improvements to the OS type engine too.


Discuss amongst yourselves,

In a sense, they do care. Apple seems to want to homogenise type with everything else and treat them like usual (meaningless) visual blocks. I think they have pursued visual conformity a bit too far; the obsessive use of Helvetica Neue Light on iOS 7 is already evident.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">"… that Apple no longer cares about typography …" for sure they don’t care about typography in their iWorks programs. This is the third release of an OS by Apple where you cannot activate small caps and some other features of opentype fonts via the typo panel (cmd+t) in any iWorks program. I reported the bug different times to apple (including in the beta Yosemite version via feedback manager) but they just don’t fix it or care about it.</div>

They tried that in OS8 JM, remember? and until  OS X there was no warning not to replace the system font(s), as there was last I looked. They've gone to great lengths to add optical sizes so lots of styles of UI fonts can appear thin at all sizes. So the "system font" (a family actually), might be called on for font files your replacement family doesn't have, and I wonder if it's as fairly wide open as any normally styled family may appear. 

"Apple seems to want to homogenise type with everything else and treat them like usual (meaningless) visual blocks. "

Not so much meaningless, as attention-less. This is like the curtain and walls and ceiling and stage in the theater, before someone else, like a MS app e.g., takes it over for their own little show. And I still ain't heard a single suggestion in all the tumult, other than some typeface no one has ever seen in it's place. :)

Wonderful. The runway model model of UX design. The closer you get, the more unnatural it looks.

<blockquote>I still ain't heard a single suggestion</blockquote>

You haven't heard all those people pointing out the obvious? That poor cash-strapped Apple should pay for a custom font that is Actually Good. But it doesn't for a very good reason: Helvetica perfectly embodies its fashion-centric*, form-over-function philosophy that has in fact been there since day one. Evidence? The one-button mouse. Looks, not brains, is how Jobs sold it to consumerist peons.

I remember OS 8, but it was released 17 years ago. All I'm saying is that they're working towards unified experience with Macs, iPads, and iPhones, so they behave like a unified system of devices. And having the capability for different system fonts on different devices would be a move in the wrong direction. 

Technically possible, sure, but not desirable to their thinking.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The one-button mouse made sense in 1984, because PCs ran DOS, hardly anyone had used a mouse before, so with two buttons, they would have to be told which button to click to do something.

Of course, making the left button bigger than the other two would have probably worked as well.

Instead, I criticized the first Mac for not having cursor keys.

I did sneer at the multicolored iMac, but hey, when you are trying to revive a company that was moribund and cash-strapped at the time, doing something that's easy and will work makes sense. The Macintosh brought the GUI out into the open, and it was a good idea, since that's how everyone uses computers now. Because Apple brought the Macintosh out before the hardware was ready to provide a GUI without compromising the ability of the computer to do real work... it was first, and controlled key patents. So I can't hold the limitations of 128 K of RAM and a 68000 processor against Steve Jobs.

That you couldn't open it up and upgrade to 512 K of RAM bought from Radio Shack, on the other hand, and scads of similar limitations in Apple products since then, I do hold against him. Monopoly pricing is not in the consumer's interest.</div>

But as Steve said once, "If you don't like it, don't buy it." There were always plenty of less expensive Windows computers available. 

But I remember how depressed I was years ago when Steve was running Pixar and Next, and an Apple employee I knew told me that Apple was probably going to go bankrupt. In spite of all the idiosyncrasies, I really like Macs.

		<div class="commentbody">On mice buttons, really...? Mountains of evidence, point to one finger smart phonic touchscreen bops, as the user input of choice, and a one button mouse is the retroactive compromise to not having a touch screen. I'm not saying' nothin' else works for nobody, and I used 'em all — just that the mounting evidence for the choices to be on the screen and not on the device, is rather overwhelming. That this form-over-function philosophy, has in fact been there since day one, is rather normal for the Mac. 

Now, if touchscreen-pokers want to tickle to some product manager's fondness for a two finger interface, just for input, never mind gesturing, I'd like to see it first, and then decide. Windows, would need such a thing to disrodentize it's OS, right? How's that coming along?

"But as Steve said once, "If you don't like it, don't buy it." "

And privately, I'm sure he and others have known if you don't like it, and won't buy it, who cares why. And even if you don't like it and do buy it, we're no longer talking about even a week's pay.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, anyone who wants a multi-button mouse can use a 3rd party one or Apple's optional multi-button mouse.

Early personal computers were used mainly by people who liked technology (remember those all-text screens and cryptic error messages?). Jobs knew that one day computers would be used by everyone and he worked towards making the interface easier. 

But an easier interface involves tradeoffs, and each user needs to pick the computer they feel best suits their needs.

The tremendous growth of tablets (which has caused a decline in PC sales) is an example of the public's desire for easy interfaces, especially for non-business use (email, websites, games, etc).</div>

You mean a silly example of unthought out and grossly general nonsense with no serious intellectual backup, I agree. 

"They've been slowly piling up since then, and in the last few years the relegation of functionality to the back burner has become quite..." 

Whomever has Whatever piling up Wherever, it's not affecting any user I've ever heard of.

"...not least in our favorite thing right here: typography."

I think that too is a silly example. The Mac OS is the only OS with an OS-wide 'typography" menu. 

"Humans can handle much more than Apple wants to give them."

I was unaware Apple was trying to give anyone anything.

Jobs had returned to Apple — which was in deep financial trouble — and the mouse was designed to coordinate with the first iMac, which Jobs wanted to be a futuristic, head-turning design. 

And the iMac did turn out to be a big success that helped save Apple. 

But it was a crummy mouse.

<blockquote>It’s [Helvetica Neue] been optimized for OS X with metrics similar to Lucida Grande.</blockquote>

[[http://asciiwwdc.com/2014/sessions/102|Session 102: Platforms State of the Union]]
<blockquote>So, we hand-tweaked the metrics of the new system font so that they are very, very close to the metrics of the old Lucida Grande font, with a result that strings have almost the same size and usually fit in the space that you've allocated in your UI so far.</blockquote>

The most informative bit is found on [[http://asciiwwdc.com/2014/sessions/209|Session 209: Adapting Your App to the New UI of OS X Yosemite]]. The segment comparing Lucida Grande and Helvetica Neue starts at 32:45. [[https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?id=209|Download the video here]].</div>

Surely they would have type experts in house who are decent enough to know that Helvetica isn’t a good choice, but they still have gone with it. From my experience with the Retina Macbook Pro, Helvetica on this screen has been incredibly crisp – enough to avoid visual confusion.

And of course I know that other typefaces would be as crisp. I’m just saying that Retina may be the only reason they had the gut to use it.</div>

But considering that they have been seeking for a “senior type designer” (from their recruitment site) and have released a custom typeface for Apple Watch, they might be still caring for typography...?

P.S. I’m wondering who those two experts are, if you are at the liberty to reveal.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding iWorks, it's clear to me that this was because they wanted document parity between the iOS and Mac versions. iOS has a less capable text rendering engine, so some stuff (like small caps) was dropped. When and if iOS gets support for such features, they will return to the Mac version. That's my guess, anyway.

FWIW, default behaviors, like OT kerning, OT ligatures and OT contextual alternates all work perfectly on the latest iOS and Mac versions of iWork. In earlier versions on the Mac, this wasn't always true.</div>

Then it is not so much a question of a bug but it’s rather a deliberate choice … and then I can understand, why they don’t fix it …
@JamesM: true. But I am an amateur and for my purposes Pages was good enough and user friendly …</div>

Another factor might be that Pages was never intended to be a page layout program in the same league as InDesign. Pros aren't doing page layout in Pages, it's a user-friendly program for amateurs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I deinstalled Yosemite. 

Did you realize that fonts with high resolution like "Mister K Informal" from Fontshop cannot be properly generated within PDF files in Apple's iWorks programs? It is a general problem of the new operating system. Adobe Suite programs can still generate proper PDF files of high resolution fonts, but the Apple OS together with its iWorks programs cannot.

Here an example:
[[http://info-buddhism.com/PDF/heine.pdf]]

The question is if Apple is ever going to fix this or not …</div>

I saw this on the OpenType list yesterday. Apparently, Yosemite's built-in PDF generator assumes all OTF fonts have a UPM of 1000. Most do, but a lot don't. I expect they will fix this in the next update.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm more sad that the font list in Yosemite saw no real extra love this year, at least in the Latin alphabet. A couple of display fonts and ITC Bodoni (yuk-it doesn't even have ligature substitution) was about it. Particularly sad since we got such a bonanza last time with DIN, Iowan Old Style and the other iBooks fonts. Oh well, I guess it's a bit much expecting Apple to buy extra fonts for me for a computer I've already paid them for. Not having true small caps support in Pages is a bit sad when TextEdit has it, though.

Frankly, I'm not too bothered by Helvetica: it's less legible but it looks a bit more businesslike than Lucida, which always did look a bit a font designed to be legible above all costs. The [[https://github.com/jenskutilek/FiraSystemFontReplacement|Fira Sans replacement program]] is kinda fun though: it has a lot of character though I'd never dare run the risk of using it.</div>
