  body: This could be a new kind of type ID quiz, based on the proportions which font
    do you think was being substituted?

  body: There was actually something like that done in Publish magazine years ago,
    a kind of back page puzzle thing. They showed a number of samples in the Adobe
    substitute fonts and you had to guess the font. I find that I can do it sometimes.
    There is a surprising amount of "font DNA" even in the proportions.
