<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Dear all,
I want to welcome you warmly from a small amazing country - Moldova, where i currently work and live.
In the last 2 months i've been working on a concept for a fashion, beauty and lifestyle magazine (size: 230mmx290mm) for women and in the last days i came back to the issue of typeface for logo.
Check the attached image and tell me what word do you read? Are there some letters that you hardly understand? Some people say the typeface i used (bodoni poster) is too bold for a magazine for women but i tried to stand out and do smth different from magazines like vogue, elle, l'officiel, bazaar, plus you can see that the magazine name is way long and strange :) that pushes me to search for a good readable typeface.
Any other suggestions of typefaces?
What typefaces you think about when i say women, fashion, beauty, lifestyle?
namy thanks,
Dumitru</div>

<div class=commentbody>I could imagine that this was a packaging from a household supply store in the early 1960s, where grandmum bought some quite expensive tableware. No direct connection to a cliche fashion mag, right now. Is that what you want?
PS
I read "Stiluette" and i understand it as a combination of "Stil" (style) and "Siluette" (silhouette) </div>

<div class=commentbody>This might be pushing the boat out a bit here but [[http://subtype.org/wyld/|Wyld]] by Subtype is a stunning contemporary face, clearly designed with fashion magazines in mind. Definitely worth a look I think even if it's legibility isn't great.
Otherwise you could try a different tack altogether. [[http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/2|Affair]] by Alejandro Paul has a very feminine feel and with it's huge set of ligatures I'm sure you could create something very exiting indeed.

<div class=commentbody>My initial intuition tagged it for the early '70s.
I am fond of the typeface, however.
What really matters is a) who the audience is and b) what you're trying to convey to them. Define that, and you'll narrow your search down for an appropriate typeface.</div>

Agree, but Agilita is good for inside pages, now for a magazine title.
@bobbybobo
What i am doing now it supposed to be a redesign of the magazine. Attached is the previous logo, that is more about silhouette, and less about style. They asked for smth more readable, bold and stylish.
@terminaldesign
Thin down those thin strokes till it hurts! What do you mean?
@poms
:)
I guess you took the whole image I attached as a design. I tried to show there just the type of the logo and how it looks on the shape of the cover, because as you see the margins of the logo are cut by the margins of the cover.
PS. Indeed, it is about style and silhouette :)
@naoiseo
Wyld looks great, and could be a gooood contrast with the bold magazine title.
Sure i will try to use Affair in the concept, i just bought it :)
@Fell
a) Women, 20-40 years interested in fashion, beauty, lifestyle.
b) trying to show them that we have fashion in our country :)

Ok it's not bold, but has a certain power and charme.
What terminaldesign probably meant, put the stroke contrast to an extreme. Make the Thins so "hairline" that it hurts, nearly invisible. Tension-filled.
<em>I guess you took the whole image I attached as a design. I tried to show there just the type of the logo and how it looks on the shape of the cover, because as you see the margins of the logo are cut by the margins of the cover.</em>
Yes, i thought something like that, but couldn't resist to tell my first impression … :)</div>

Not easy, but I'll try make it clearer :-)
Dumitru, James is trying to tell you to increase the contrast in Stiluette. Contrast is about the difference between thin and bold parts of a character, not the weight of the typeface (so Helvetica Ultra Light has naearly no contrast and modern typefaces as Didot, Bodoni has it plenty). See images below. BTW I quite like your cover sample.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Dumitru,
I appreciate the classic look, records Valentino’s work.
In general I find the title very nice, even it is very classic and not that new (doesn’t hurt in my eyes that it is so).
But would be better if you would find another solution for the „first number“ button.
Makes the whole title look cheap somehow in my opinion.
Seocnd I did like the Helvetica in black more. More elegant and classy.
Thinner hairlines in the title: Much better!
Did you try Didot faces instead of Bodoni?
salute
Stefan
Don’t forget to abolish this button!! ;-)</div>

The strokes of the modified letters of your logo become thinner and thinner now, while Urquell sets the point, from which the strokes become thin earlier and then the stroke width does not change anymore. Thin it down, till it hurts, may be a bit overdone, but calligraphically it was better in Urquell’s example. I miss the correct terms, but I hope it is clear enough, what I mean.</div>

<div class=commentbody>With everything so tight, the counters in the "e"s become too open.
I would recommend narrowing both the top counter, and also the width of the right stroke, and possibly opening the i_l_u letterspace by a small amount (or, alternatively, increasing the space inside the "u"), for a better overall colour/tone.
You see, the relative stroke widths and negative space within "u" and "e" are designed for text setting small, with normal tracking. They are designed to be different from one another, so that text matter doesn't become too grey. However, in an ultra-tight display setting, these differences become a liability, nbot an asset.
By the way, is there some other way to deal with the Abreve accent, for settings with negative leading?</div>
