  Institution Press Publication in 2011 titled _Jihad in the Arabian Sea_ by Camille

  interesting suggestions, but I did not spot any that were a match for _Jihad in
  the Arabian Sea_ \r\nThe repeating letters in  _Jihad in the Arabian Sea_  and the
  author's name look identical, but I appreciate that this does not itself guarantee
  that this is not lettering.\r\nI would love to see any suggestions you might have.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Super! Two top sleuths. I would have never thought of Da Vinci as Faux Arabic
    and would never have looked in these handwriting fonts. But it really works here.\r\nMany
    thanks.\r\nDon\r\np.s. Sorry Mike that the Typophile credit system won't let me
    cite you as well."

  body: "It <em>does</em> work surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nActually, Da Vinci was the
    second font I looked at. My first guess was Judith Sutcliff's <a href='http://www.will-harris.com/store-h/tagliente.html'
    target='_blank'>Tagliente</a> - which has some elements in common - and may have
    worked better for readability of the g and (especially) P. I suppose not as well
    with some other letters, though."
