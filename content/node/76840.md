body: "I want to add a t with a cedilla under it to an existing font. Unicode shows
  that character encoded as 0163 but the font already has a t with a comma accent
  encoded with 0163 with a glyph name of tcommaaccent.\r\n\r\nI'm adding it to the
  PUA and THOUGHT that I could name it t_cedilla to make search engines find it when
  the regular t is searched. I've also tried naming conventions of tcedilla, t.cedilla
  and uni007400B8 (0074 is the t and 00B8 is the cedilla) but to no avail. The tcommaaccent
  character that was already in the font is found when a t is searched.\r\n\r\nI'm
  exporting from InD CS3 and searching in Acrobat 9.\r\n\r\nI THOUGHT I'd done this
  before in another font, but of course can't find where.\r\n\r\nIs there something
  that the tcommaaccent glyph has associated with it that allows it to be found or
  should what I've done be working?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen"

  body: "I recommend using the name \"uni0163\" rather than \"tcommaaccent\". The
    \"*commaaccent\" names are not recognized by older versions of Mac OS X (they
    won't even display on screen if the font is OpenType PS .otf). \r\n\r\nFor the
    other glyph, \"t_cedilla\" should actually work, although \"t_uni0327\" or \"uni00740327\"
    would be better, because U+0327 is the Unicode codepoint of combining cedilla,
    which should be used in that case. Have you tried not using the PUA? Such glyphs
    should be accessed through the \"ccmp\" feature: \r\n\r\n<code>feature ccmp {
    \r\n  sub t uni0327 by t_uni0327;\r\n} ccmp;</code>\r\n\r\nAlso, you might try
    the glyphname \"uni0163.salt\" and see what happens. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah, yes, of course. Sorry, my advice was misguided. \r\n\r\nActually, this
    should be done completely differently: \r\n\r\nT with comma should be named uni021A
    and have the Unicode U+021A\r\nT with cedilla should be named uni0163 and have
    the Unicode U+0163\r\n\r\nMore references: \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/3970\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/8214\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/49347\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/55853\r\n\r\n(Note

  body: "I saw that wiki entry and admittedly did the forehead slap with a Homeresque
    \"DOH!\" in frustration. Unfortunately, I can't change what's already in the font
    otherwise I'd make it \"right.\"\r\n\r\nYou're advice wasn't misguided at all
    Adam, you gave me the answer I needed, the ccmp. I knew about that comma vs. cedilla
    thing and really wanted to make sure the glyph names I was adding were as \"safe\"
    as could be and why they weren't being found in my search of the PDF.\r\n\r\nI
    mentioned thinking I'd done this before, and driving home last night dawn broke
    over Marblehead and I remembered that the font I was working on at the time had
    a massive ligature feature to which I had added the accented characters I was
    building.\r\n\r\nI've decided to encode my new glyphs in the PUA and name them
    using \"uni\" method. I also added the ccmp feature as you suggest and all is
    well!!\r\n\r\nI had thought it was the glyph name only that made the search thing
    I mentioned work. But it appears that it's the OT feature that makes it work and
    that the name really doesn't matter?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for all the help,\r\nKen"

  body: "Oy! Next question.\r\n\r\nAs described above I used a ccmp but when I insert
    that glyph from InDesign's glyph panel it sees it 2 seperate characters. It's
    using the glyhph I created but when the text is copied from InD (or a PDF generated
    from InD!) to something else (Word for instace) I get two characters, the t and
    the cedilla next to one another.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do in the font
    to prevent InD from doing that?\r\n\r\nWe normally import InDesign tagged text
    files, and when I use the tagged text code for that character (<0xE2A1>) it imports
    as the single glyph and as well as copies and PDFs from InD as the single glyph.
    Which (I guess?) makes sense, right?\r\n\r\nOy! (again) and thanks again."

  body: "It's two characters because that's the only possible way to encode the text
    in Unicode. If you use PUA, then from the linguistic point of view, InDesign won't
    \"know\" what the letter is. And the letter is t with cedilla. In order to process
    the text (search, hyphenate, change the case when you tell it to change it from
    lowercase to uppercase), it needs to store the text using Unicode. And the only
    way to do this is t followed by a combining cedilla. (That assuming that you don't
    want to use 0163). \r\n\r\nUppercasing is a good example: when encoded as t followed
    by combining cedilla, InDesign can change the text to uppercase correctly (the
    result will be T followed by combining cedilla, which again your \"ccmp\" could
    replace with one glyph). But if you use PUA, InDesign won't be able to change
    case, because \"logically\" this character will be an \"anonymous glyph\". \r\n\r\nA."
