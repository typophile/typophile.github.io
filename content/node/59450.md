  me a logo and the only restriction was to use an \"A\" from his nickname \"Aero\"
  but is a bit difficult\r\nkeep shapes from this \"A\" and apply to the entire logotype.
  here some photos.\r\ni think i need more stylization of the shapes.\r\nwhat do you
  think?\r\n\r\ngreetings.\r\n\r\nthe original \"A\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aero-a_5309.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\npossible

    downwards. But the second try with your stylised letters is better than the first
    one.\r\n\r\nAnd make sure you distort the perfect round bullet inside A.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "I like the last one you posted, especially since the dot in the \"O\" is
    repeated / reflected in the dot of the \"A\". The one right above it doesn't seem
    to be cohesive.\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: "Your sketches are more powerful and expressive than your digital version
    of the logo.\r\nNone of the two convey the idea of wind (\"aero\" in greek, but
    I think you knew that) while the last sketch was quite streamlined.\r\nTry to
    keep the swoosh of the R, but give it square edges.\r\nAlso pay attention to the
    thickness of the lines; in the first version the top line of the E and the last
    one are too different :)\r\n"
