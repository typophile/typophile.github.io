  body: "The \"group character\", called a \"ligature\", requires OpenType programming.\r\nMake
    the ligature glyph, and give it a name that is the names of the two glyphs it
    will replace joined by _ (like \"r_i\"). Do not give it any Unicode value.\r\nOpen
    the OpenType panel and add feature \"liga\" if it is not already there. In it
    put the code:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  sub r i by r_i;\r\n} liga;\r\n</code>\r\nwith
    a sub line for every ligature substitution you want.\r\nCompile it, and test it
    in the Preview panel."
