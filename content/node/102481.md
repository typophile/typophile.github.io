  used on this site: [[http://www.sousstyle.com|Sous Style]]. I've also attached a
  screen shot.\r\n\r\nIt looks like they're using a serif (in the CSS it specifies
  Baskerville, but I've not known Baskerville to look like that) and an unknown \"Geometric
  Light\" embedded typeface - but I'm having no luck identifying either.\r\n\r\nThanks
  much!!\r\nMichelle\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SousStyleSite_5854.jpg]"

  body: i believe it is Baskerville. many variations out there but [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/old-baskerville/|Old
    Baskerville XLight]] seems to match.
