  body: "Lintype's old stand-alone CD application [[FontExplorer]] (<strong>NOT</strong>
    to be confused with the new\u2014and free\u2014font manager FontExplorer X) can
    sort Linotype fonts by subjective criteria, including some emotions. \r\n\r\nPlease
    contact me offline (over my profile) if I can help any more with this.\r\n\r\nThere
    may be some other tools available as well. I think that FontShop San Francisco
    might have something online that can do this, but I'm not so familiar with their
    offerings."

      you still remember Type-Expertise since your last post about it on this forum
      in november 2005 :-)\r\n\r\nI am in the application developement stage, which
      takes time and money as me and the people who beleive in this concept are doing
      it without financial support, but we'll get there ! and I will let you know.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nDenis
