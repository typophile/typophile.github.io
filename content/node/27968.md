  to write a 6000word essay and need some inspiration or direction...can anyone help.\r\n\r\nSome
  idea I had were.\r\n\r\nHow technology effected typography...\r\nHow letters reflect
  the human body...\r\n\r\nbut these seem a little cliche...what exciting new topics
  are there for me to discover and enjoy...or where can i look to find out whats hot
  and not to give me any ideas?"
