  box was now checked. Doesn't seem to be anything in the Options > generate OpenType
  that would have caused this.\r\n\r\nAny clues as to what is going on? Can we make
  fonts where embedding is not allowed & InDesign CS2 won't subset the fonts in a
  PDF?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    box of FontLab, I kept the family name the same, but changed the style name to
    \"book-restricted\", then used the \"build names\" button. On the subsheet, \"OpenType
    specific names,\" I used the \"Build OpenType Names\" button. On the subsheet
    \"Additional OpenType Names,\" I clicked on the red \"X\" which is the reset button.
    In the past, this has always gotten the names right.\r\n\r\nThen on the \"embedding\"
    subsheet, I selected \"Embedding of this font is not allowed.\"\r\n\r\nSince I
    don't really know just how it works, I also hit \"Apply\" on each subsheet & then
    OK'd the main sheet. And the OTF file generated, when re-opened in FontLab did
    show \"embedding of this font is not allowed.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the fonts themselves,
    we store fonts in:\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe InDesign CS2\\Fonts\r\n\r\nrather
    than in C:\\Windows\\Fonts,\r\n\r\nso I don't really see how a conflict would
    arise -- the program will check the \\Adobe InDesign CS2\\Fonts location first,
    right? And the new font was in that folder, had a different name, and InDesign
    found it just fine. This routine has always worked before when developing OTF
    fonts (I usually have a few versions before I get things right), except I've never
    tried to prevent embedding before.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm really after here comes about
    because we are going to set a book where the designer (book designer) wants to
    take our InDesign files and then place the images. The InDesign files will go
    back & forth, so fonts will go back & forth as well. I don't want to give the
    designer copies of our fonts that they can then use for other work, so I figured
    if I used fonts where embedding wasn't allowed, then switched them to the same
    font where embedding was allowed just before making the PDF that went off to the
    printer, all would be well."
