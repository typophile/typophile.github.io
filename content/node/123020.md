  body: "I've done some Google searching, and I haven't found a technical term for
    the type of capital W usually found in Garamond and also present in Kabel. One
    encyclopedia referred to the capital W in Kabel as being \"splayed\", but I don't
    think that is the usual term, if any exists.\r\n\r\nBasically, the issue is that
    W is, in this unusual form, topologically equivalent to X instead of I."

  body: In the Book "Designing Type" by Karen Cheng, they are referred to as "overlapping".
    If there was a more specific term, she would probably have known about it.

    it is drawn as two overlapping Vs, I think it is a very apt description...."

  body: It's even apt for the ordinary form of W, since that's pointy on the bottom
    like a V and not round on the bottom like a U, even if <em>historically</em> the
    letter W replaced uu in printing.
