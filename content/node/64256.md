    an answer.\r\n\r\nJust looking for something close, I think [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/gazette/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D52%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DVICTORINOX%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D21|Gazette]]

    but you need to spell it out better than that for us. You did say \"logo\", and
