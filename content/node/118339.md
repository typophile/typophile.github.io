    do is to say \"Thank You\" and move on:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LuxSansBold_4326.png]"

  body: "I can suspect what the problem is (it happened before).\r\nThe image attachment
    is named \"image_171.jpg\". \r\nThere is something strange in Typophile server
    with \"image_XXX.jpg\" attachments (probably the server re-uses the filename)
    and it can appear as one image to one user and a different image to another (probably
    an older one, from another thread, or just taken from the user browser's cache).\r\n\r\nTo
    cut a long story short, Kevin we both viewed the same (wrong) image but the actual
    image uploaded by Mary Lynn is different.\r\n\r\nMary Lynn could you please upload
    your image again, but first change the local image filename in your PC to something
    totally different, e.g. \"lynn-01.jpg\" ?\r\n\r\nPS: This is the (wrong) image
    both Kevin and I viewed: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lyn-wrong-image_5488.jpg]"

  body: "Fivos, when I clicked on your attribution link, my initial reaction was \"he
    got this wrong\"--you had to scroll down to the tester and set it to Lux Sans
    Bold and type in GRADUATE before you saw anything that vaguely resembled the posted
    sample.\r\n\r\nIf it was the wrong sample to begin with, then I owe Domingle an
    apology. But if she jumped to the same conclusion I did without exploring it further...."

  body: I second Kevin's comment. I would also note that there are very few chances
    that the posted image would be replaced with one containing the exact title of
    the thread...
