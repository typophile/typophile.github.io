  It is relatively experimental and readability seems to be limited. I think the construction
  rules are quite obvious: Each letter consists of one \"thick\" simple shape and
  one thin line.\r\nThe font is not yet finished, some symbols are missing and I'm
  not happy with some letters.\r\n"

  body: I like it too. There's a touch of Art Deco and old-fashioned electronic cicuitry.
    N & W are the two letters that don't work for me. I also think some of the thick
    strokes in the lower case could be thinner, such as h, k, m & n.

  body: "Wow.. really good look of this..!! :D  if you reach solve all I believe this
    will be a really good font..!!\r\n- I found several troubles in this current work
    that confuse me. you \"i\" looks like \"u\" beside to \"c\" pattern... I read
    \"thuck\" instead \"thick\"\r\n\r\n- I really love your ampersand\r\n\r\n- \"e\"
    top could be rotate 90\xBA to right\r\n\r\n- \"n\" looks like \"h\" (if I don't
    have watched that before)\r\n\r\n- \"s\" and \"t\" are a little confuse.. I don't
    know how solve the \"s\" but your \"t\" may be you could follow the same \"r\"
    pattern but reflect down the thin line.\r\n\r\n- \"v\" and \"w\" need review for
    me.\r\n\r\nand well.. is amazing challenge to solve.. hope you can complete successfuly
    this work.\r\nRegards\r\n=)\r\nPedro\r\n"
