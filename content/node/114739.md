  body: "Good catch Ryuk. \r\nThe record is post 2011 so it's almost certainly digital
    Brothers, which according to Identifont was designed by John Downer for Emigre
    in 1999. I note from his Identifont biography that he published essays on type
    history and hand lettering have in Emigr\xE9 magazine and House magazine. Unfortunately,
    I have none of these at hand.\r\nDoes anyone have any idea as to the source of
    the original design?\r\nThe Myfonts tags included _cigar_ so I looked for matching
    lettering. I found an online image of a Tampa Life cigar box label from 1927 which
    looks somewhat similar toe Brothers: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TampaLifeCigar1927_4427.jpg]\r\nsource:

    image at: http://russellsshirts.blogspot.ca/2012/11/cigar-label-tampa-life.html\r\nAnything
    else?\r\nPerhaps there is a 19th century woodtype? I note Brothers has catchwords,
    which were available as special cuts from 19th century foundries.\r\nI note Brothers
    is similar to Gin http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/gin/ a design
    at least partly inspired by gin and whiskey bottles.\r\nFinally, I see that what
    comes around goes around. The logo for a new cigar box -- Caja del Campion http://www.cajadelcampeon.com/blogs/news
    -- is a match for Brothers. The blog refers to the movie O Brother Where Are Thou,
    which which seems to use Brothers for the title -- with the alternate R, but not
    to the Brothers font.\r\nDon\r\n"
