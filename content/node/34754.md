  by Ian Party.\r\n\r\nBased on the Commission Jeaugeon\u2019s models and on Philippe
  Grandjean\u2019s classic character, the Romain BP celebrates the marriage of geometric
  rationality and elegance, of science and craftsmanship. \r\n\r\nThe Romain BP Text
  is actually closer to the Commission\u2019s model than Grandjean\u2019s Romain du
  Roi. It is more synthetic in its structure, more radical, and thus, more modern.
  It is a contemporary text typeface based on a structure that was created in 1690,
  not a revival mimicking Greandjean\u2019s shapes. It is an attempt to imagine the
  aesthetic choices we should be making in the modern day, based on the universal
  theoretical model. \r\n\r\nThe Romain BP Headline is a complementary font, which,
  free of text constraints, fully exploits the amazing graphic potential of the original
  model. \r\n\r\nmore informations on our website\r\n\r\nYou can download our free
  trial version to test the font on your own computer.\r\n\r\nwww.bpfoundry.com\r\n\r\n"

    the sloped-Roman italic.\r\nIt would be nice to have both.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "if you look to the old model you can see that there is no real slanted roman.
    the choice was difficult and this one is a pure design choice who (i think) fit
    better with the \"roman construction\", if you go on BP website you can read more
    about some of my choices. In a few month i will release two other typefaces around
    Romain du Roi, one based on Nicolas Jarry calligraphy, and one based on the type
    in church book of early begging of the 17 century, and then a book about the 17
    century french typefaces \"the origin of the circle shape\". this book will finish
    my work around the Romain du Roi construction. in between BP will release other
    typefaces based on old french model\r\n\r\nian"

  body: "From what I remember there were <em>three</em> distinct italics, although
    the \"official\" and/or \"production\" status of each is still open to discussion;
    and one of them was in fact a slanted Roman (even though it seems to have never
    been cut).\r\n\r\n> BP will release other typefaces based on old french model\r\n\r\nBTW,
    are you familiar with the late-19th-century work of the Deberny foundry? I'm actually
    working (although at a snail's pace) on a revival from that period.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
