  to identify the monospaced font in this picture:\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.nerdpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vs2010_full.jpg</img>\r\n\r\nwithout
  much success. It looks similar to Lucida Console but it's not the one. The font
  in the picture looks more... square-ish and narrower than Lucida and it looks taller
  and narrower than Consolas too.\r\n\r\nAny ideas will be most appreciated!"
