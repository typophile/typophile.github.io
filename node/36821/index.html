<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>If this is obvious, I apologize in advance for my ignorance, but does Albert Schiller ring a bell for anyone? Printer, type designer, artist? Around early 1900s to 1940s?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The book <em>Typography: When Who How</em> has an entry for a <strong>Walter Schiller</strong>, born in Hamburg, 1920. Could that be your man?
And according to <em>An A-Z of Type Designers</em>, Walter Schiller co-authored a book with Albert Kapr: <em>Gestalt und Funktion der Typografie</em> (1977, 1983). Both men taught at the Hochschule für Graphik und Buchkunst (HGB) in Leipzig.
(By the way, no entries for an Arthur Schiller in either book, or others I consulted.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey... I like a bit of detective work now and then! :-D
I have a book on Goudy that does not mention anybody named Schiller, but look at what Google turned up at the University of Delaware, in their <a href=http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/goudy.htm>Frederic W. Goudy Collection</a>:
<strong><em>Frederic W. Goudy: A Memorial</em> by Albert Schiller. Printed by Advertising Agencies' Service Company, Inc., 1947. Signed by Schiller. 1 item (1 p.).</strong>
The same University has a collection titled <a href=http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/jhnsn_f.htm>Fridof Johnson Papers</a>, in which it states:
<strong>The first series, a compilation of subject files created by Johnson and arranged in alphabetical order, consists of information on particular people and topics. This series represents one of the collection’s strengths, as it contains a vast amount of material on prominent graphic artists, printers, and typographers with whom Johnson worked or corresponded. Included in his archive are the names Albert Schiller, Eric Gill, John Lehman, Rudolph Ruzicka, Paul Bennett, Warren Chappell, Frederick</strong> [sic] <strong>Goudy, and Joseph Weiler.</strong></div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice find, Armin! Maybe the <a href=http://www.nypl.org/>NYPL</a> catalogs will have something on Albert Schiller.
And I see you've written about <a href=http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/003819.html>Copperplate Gothic</a>, too... I have to catch up on my Speak Up reading.
But I digress. Google has turned up some more links, but except for "The Museum" print, they are just brief mentions in long lists:

<div class=commentbody>My grandfather was a typesetter/compositor who worked with Albert Schiller at Advertising Agencies' Service Co. Mr. Schiller used to give a new print to his co-workers every Christmas. My grandfather set many of them. They're gorgeous. I'm dying to know how many are out there, and if there's some we could buy somewhere. He didn't sign them anywhere that I can see, so it may be hard to track them down. My grandfather said Mr. Schiller had a vision of art for the masses - affordable, ect. I know this conversation is a couple of months old, but if you're still checking in, I thought you might want more information! DK</div>

<div class=commentbody>I realize this forum hasn't offered anything new for Albert Schiller. I just received a box full of really nice printing ephemera. While researching I came across your site and thought I would share a piece I was researching. It is a broadside, approx. 8" x 14 1/2" printed in red for the Advertising Agencies' Service Company, Inc. for their 16th Christmas Holiday Keepsake 1939-1940. Signed by Albert Schiller. </div>

<div class=commentbody>When I heard the name Schiller, I thought of Friedrich von Schiller, an associate of Goethe and the most famous of German playwrights - I see from Wikipedia that he is accused of being the inventor of the melodrama.
I am glad that the story of Albert Schiller has been turned up, however, rescuing him from obscurity.</div>
