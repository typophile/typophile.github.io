  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Ive been asked to design a website for a client in Durham, UK. Its for a collection of shops that are spread out round the city - a bit like a shopping centre but not all in one place.</p>
<p>They have specifically requested some form of logo based around the cathedral which is within the city, however, my inspiration has run out since the cathedral isnt greatly unique.</p>
<p>I have designed the logo (which should be underneath) - does this look ok? Im not sure if it works well or not.</p>
<p>Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!<img src="/images/old-images/Logo-Design-8_5923.gif" alt=""></p>

I realise you aren&rsquo;t actually promoting the Cathedral, it is just a visual reference for Durham, but I&rsquo;m sure you could come up with a much stronger image.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I personally dont want to use the cathedral within the logo since i dont think it will carry through properly - however, the client is really keen to have it in the logo. I have designed others that arent based around the cathedral but not sure if he will like them or not.</p>
<p>I do agree with the comments - i think the font is way too modern for the logo (with the cathedral) and i should try something a bit more British.</p>
<p>The shops are a small collection of little boutique shops including a cycle shop, hardware stores, jewellery shops and some cafes! They arent a shopping centre as such since they arent housed under the same roof!</p>

<p>I think your image captures it alright but, as I said earlier, it needs to be stronger unless you perhaps find a typeface that works with your lighter treatment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Guys, thanks so much for the comments thus far - it has been really useful. Im not an expert in this area and enjoy designing logos but this client really stumped me with following the idea on the cathedral.</p>
<p>I want to try and keep the font type as simple as possible and think that gothic fonts can quite often look too detailed which doesnt always replicate well in printed material. Ive created this version with gill sans and i think it looks better - comments? Does it work better than the first version?</p>
<p>@tintin81 - love the look of the mark you attached. Looks simple and maybe something along the lines of that would be much more suitable. I think i was maybe trying to concentrate too much on the outside of the cathedral rather than inside - gives a different perspective on it. Incidentally what is the font used in the mark? It looks very simple, plain but totally 100% effective with the mark!</p>
