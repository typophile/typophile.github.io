  body: "Patty raises a good point. There are at least two kinds of books on *book
    design*. One variety is a how-to, which in many ways is a set of rules you should
    follow, and perhaps a list of typefaces. The problem with this is there is no
    one set of rules even at a given time, and moreover, the rules change with both
    technology and fashion.\r\n\r\nA second kind of design book chronicles more how
    designers think about their work, what they see as problems, and how these problems
    are resolved. The problem with this is you need some background before you have
    an understanding of what the process is about; before you can glean very much
    from them.\r\n\r\nI'd put Robert Bringhurst's book in the first category, Rich
    Hendel's in the second. You should probably have both, Though I'd prefer Tschichold
    for a \"rules\" resource.\r\n\r\nAnd depending on you perspective, there are also
    two kinds of book design, the cover and the interior. The two should perhaps relate,
    but the question is how much? In university press publishing, by in large the
    function of the jacket is viewed to be the same as that of a poster. That is an
    advertising function, and ephemeral. With obvious exceptions, the interior is
    suppose to be timeless (though that too is in some real ways an illusion)."

    on what sort of book you are designing. This is true of most Trade publishers
    - they even have separate departments to handle the covers and the interiors.
    But with the sort of books I do, illustrated books (which means a book that is
    illustrated throughout, whether with photography, graphics, or illustrations),
    the cover and interior are done together and relate strongly."

  body: "<cite> > there are also two kinds of book design, the cover and the interior.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere
    are also several sub-kinds of interior book design. The design considerations
    and parameters of a trade illustrated book (like Patty's bread-and-butter) are
    different than those of scholarly typographic (more like Charles' sort of thing).
    How-to and illustrated reference (of which I've done my share) are very different
    from poetry. Cookbooks are different from fiction. Gift books are a different
    breed from trade nonfiction. Etcetera, etcetera. \r\n\r\nIt occurs to me that
    we frequently fall into the trap of contrasting book design & typography with
    other design genres (<em>\"Please suggest a good font for books\"</em>) as though
    books comprised a homogeneous monolith. Which of course they do not. \r\n\r\n--
