  body: The way you phrased your question is interesting - "stripping down the serifs"
    sounds as if one is peeling some vegetable to get rid of some rough texture or
    hard parts.  I think the process with which a traditional type or script turns
    into a san-serif  is fascinating and has occurred in almost all the scripts I
    have encountered - Arabic, Japanese, Thai, etc etc.  In Japanese for example the
    brush-strokes which have thick and thin could be  made mono-width, and the stroke
    endings which often twist into a tiny this edge are neglected. More than just
    stripping extra detail, san-serif as it has become to be used means finding the
    generic essential shape of the letter of a script and presenting it free of the
    traditional marks left by tools such as a chisel, bamboo pen, quill or brush.
    I have tried to do that for Arabic 50 years ago and am just now finishing the
    font!

    body: "Designer Jason Vandenberg fashioned a Bodoni Sans Serif.\r\n\r\n<em>Bodoni
      Sans</em> (2014)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/greyscale-type/bodoni-sans/\r\n\r\n\r\n\xB6
      Modern typefaces, such as Bodoni and Didot have been the quintessential faces
      of fashion for nearly two centuries. With high contrast, flat serifs, and horizontal
      stress, this combination exudes confidence and elegance.\r\n\r\n\xB6 Today,
      Sans-Serif typefaces have become the new standard for the description of modern.
      Clean lines, extremely thin weights, and rational forms are common in fashion
      and design today. With this in mind, are Modern typefaces like Bodoni still
      the standard? Yves Saint Laurent said: \u201CFashions fade, style is eternal.\u201D
      Is there a way to move Bodoni forward, while maintaining the inherent style?\r\n\r\n\xB6
      Bodoni Sans moves forward by removing the serifs, while maintaining the high
      contrast and elegant curves. Although, these fonts are more than just chopping
      off the serifs. Several cuts of Bodoni were compared, and collectively used
      as a base. The classical proportions of the capitals and x-heights were maintained,
      but the letterforms were rebalanced for use without serifs. Contemporary modifications
      were made to some widths, as well as an all new Light weight was created. The
      letterforms were also engineered with a reductive bezier point method, for optimal
      performance. Together these updates to the classic provide a truly modern look.\r\n\r\n\xB6
      High contrast is the key feature of Bodoni Sans. To maintain this contrast over
      a wide range of sizes, three optical sizes were drawn: Standard, Display and
      Text. Contrast adjustments were made for each optical size for optimal performance.
      The Standard was designed for the mid range of 12 to 60pt, Display for 48pt
      and above, and Text for 6 to 12pt.\r\n\r\n\xB6 Web/Digital use was also considered
      while developing Bodoni Sans. The fonts were tested as web formats, and examined
      on a variety of screens, to ensure seamless use in both print and digital applications.\r\n\r\n\xB6
      Bodoni Sans is a new classic built on the foundation of two centuries of history.
      Fresh and contemporary, while feeling familiar. Stylish and sophisticated, Bodoni
      Sans is a new Modern."

    particular approach to deriving sans from serif designs on his website: http://www.martinmajoor.com/6_my_philosophy.html\r\n\r\nIIRC
    Syntax was one of the first, if not the first, published sans-serif directly derived
    from a Renaissance [serif, text] design. There\u2019s also the (unpublished) sans
    that Van Krimpen made to match his Romulus in the 1930s."

    face modeled on the Renaissance serif typeface, similar to <strong><em>Bembo</em></strong>.
    The uppercase has a wide proportion, and the terminals not being parallel to the
    baseline provide a sense of animation. The lowercase a and g follow the old style
    model of having two storeys. The italics are a combination of humanist italic
    forms, seen in the lowercase italic q, and realist obliques, seen in the lowercase
    italic a, which retains two storeys, unlike in other humanist sans-serif typefaces
    like <strong><em>FF Scala Sans</em></strong> and <strong><em>Gill Sans</em></strong>,
    where the a has a single storey italic."</blockquote>
