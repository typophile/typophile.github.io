body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nIve been wondering about how other designers center-position
  their logo marks.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, I myself treat the entire logo incl.
  subtag as a block, placing that block slightly higher than 'dead center'. It seems
  more visually appealing to me.\r\n\r\nWhat's your take on this? Do you go by mathematics,
  purely by sight, is there a general consensus, any set rules, or does it vary on
  the logo you are implementing?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: The optical centre is indeed higher than the mathematical centre, but then
    again a logotype shaped as an upside-down pyramid might even things out because
    a pointed shape is optically smaller (lower) than a squared shape (like the apex
    of A that needs to ascend slightly above H to look equal).

  body: "Indeed, I agree with all of you..\r\n\r\nFor example the card I am working
    on right now has a large wordmark with a subtag which is in a subtle color and
    doesn't bring much 'weight' to the overal composition, therefor i think it doesn't
    need to sit much higher.  I would place it slightly higher if the subtag was more
    substantial.\r\n\r\n(card will be screenprinted on tick black paper, wordmark
    white, tag gold foil)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C_4270.jpg]"

  body: 'It may look different in  black/white/gold, but to me, "PROJECTEN" looks
    off-center, but not enough to appear to be deliberate.  It also looks disconnected,
    but the tail on the /R does tend to push it away.  I''m disturbed by the slope
    of the trim on the left leg of the /M. My eye keeps trying to make it parallel
    with the \R''s tail and failing.  Just my two centimes. '

  body: "I would be more concerned with the letterspacing of the wordmark.\r\nIt is
    uneven\u2014scrunched in the middle and tenuous at the left, contradicting the
    symmetry of the layout.\r\nIt\u2019s a mistake to make a single feature in the
    middle of the word, which is not where the intial attraction should be.\r\nWas
    just mentioning Cassandre\u2019s YSL logo in another thread:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ysl-logo_3652.jpg]\r\nNow,
    this style of letterpacing might not be <em>au courant</em>, but at least the
    density is evenly distributed."
