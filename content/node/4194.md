body: I&#39;ve received an inquiry from a small developer who wants to embed one of
  my commercial fonts in an application he&#39;s developing. He says that the font
  won&#39;t be accessible for printing or use outside the application--it would just
  be used for interface elements. If anyone has dealt with this kind of thing before,
  I would love to get some advice. My standard license doesn&#39;t cover this kind
  of thing &#40;yet&#41;.

    in applications under 150 x 150 pixels. Applications over this size will be priced

    with characters smaller than 150x150 pixels...

  body: For fonts licensed from House Ind. you&#39;d have to obtain a separate license.
    So I assumed you would call them before purchasing a basic licensed font off their
    site. I posted that as an example for Mark, not to change the subject. Sorry.

  body: In this case, it&#39;s not a multimedia kind of thing, so I don&#39;t think
    the House EULA is relavent. The size the fonts would be used would be smallish--12
    to 18 pixels roughly.  <BR> <BR>I have also found out that it would be possible
    &#40;though probably not easy&#41; to extract the font&#40;s&#41; from the application.
    Or, at least not possible to prevent extraction entirely &#40;similar to the situation
    with PDF&#41;.

  body: Right. I guess once you&#39;ve &#34;rasterized&#34; the typeface it is no
    longer ... really ... a font software. <BR> <BR>Emigre is pretty clear on how
    they feel about embedding for multi-media too. <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>Can
    I embed fonts into digital documents? <BR>Web sites and CD-ROM titles may feature
    bitmap images made using our fonts, but the fonts themselves may not be distributed.
    Embeddable font formats require the duplication of the fonts and thus seriously
    compromise the security of typefaces. The Emigre license excludes font embedding,
    except as described in the Embedding License Addendum. This addendum allows restricted
    distribution of portable digital documents in Adobe Acrobat PDF format under specific
    circumstances. <BR> <BR>Distributing copies of a printed document is not the same
    as distributing copies of a digital document with embedded fonts. The latter also
    distributes live fonts, which add value to the digital document by making it more
    useful, flexible, and cheaper to distribute than a traditional printed document.
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, currently available embedding technologies, which incorporate
    live fonts into web pages and digital documents, do so by jeopardizing the security
    of the fonts. This is largely due to the fact that developers of these technologies
    have little or no vested interest in protecting the intellectual property of independent
    font developers. Before allowing such usage of their fonts, font developers want
    to be certain that encryption of the embedded fonts is secure enough to prevent
    unauthorized access or use. <BR> <BR>We can only hope that this situation will
    improve in the future. If not, independent font developers, who depend on the
    sales from their fonts, will find it increasingly difficult to invest in the development
    of new designs.<!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote> <BR>

  body: Mark, figure out how extractable the font would be. For example, Shockwave
    is unsafe, while Flash and PDF are pretty safe. Charge them an extra amount based
    on that level of security. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Mark, <BR> <BR>I invented an Embedded Electronic Device license for just this
    purpose. <BR> <BR>I have been regularly contacted by companies who want to make
    slot machine interfaces with my fonts &#40;aka gaming devices&#41; so I came up
    with a seperate license for this purpose. <BR> <BR>The main clause in this license
    states the font used must be protected and NOT be reverse engineerable or extractable
    from the electronic device. <BR> <BR>I define an electronic device as as a kiosk,
    gaming device, portable electronic device, etc. with no other restrictions beyond
    the normal scope of licensing. <BR> <BR>In some cases you can base the license
    fee on number of estimated or real SKUs being distributed with your font&#40;s&#41;
    on &#39;em. You can make this an annual license. <BR> <BR>In most cases they prefer
    not to disclose these numbers so you&#39;ll most likely need to do a one time
    buyout license of the font for this use for ONE title. &#40;eg. Can use for Pac
    Man but not Ms. Pac Man&#41; <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Hi, <BR> <BR>We&#39;re doing a workshop on the subject of type designers working
    with software companies at TypeCon this year. Jim Wasco from AMT and I will be
    leading it, and we&#39;re certainly going to be touching on this issue.  <BR>
    <BR>Security is certainly the key here, you should expect to be paid more if your
    font is a system-wide resource as opposed to it being locked into the application.
    <BR> <BR>However securing the font is not completely straight forward. You want
    to ask the customer if the font is going to be supplied as a TrueType or in some
    derivative format - having it in a non-standard format would make it much harder
    to re-use. If it&#39;s going to be a TTF even if the font is privately installed
    it is still theoretically possible for it to be snagged. On Win 9x a privately
    installed font has to exist on the hard-disk somewhere as a file. In more recent
    versions of Windows it can exist in memory. All of this protection is a bit of
    a waste if the font itself can be easily extracted from the installation package
    prior to install.  <BR> <BR>I would get details of the protection written into
    the contract, and have some clause that would pay-out if the fonts were found
    to be extractable. That way the customer is putting some money behind their assurances.  <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s important not to get into side-tracked by embedding permissions -
    the OpenType and earlier TrueType specification make it completely clear that
    these relate to &#39;document&#39; embedding. If someone tries to tell you they
    can embed your font into their application based on the embedding bits set in
    your retail fonts point them at the specs, and send them to me.  <BR> <BR>Hope
    this helps. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR>

  body: Thanks everyone for the suggestions. I&#39;ve made a special arrangement with
    the developer to include specific wording in his license for the application which
    explains that the font&#40;s&#41; may only used with the application and where
    to obtain a license for other use. The font&#40;s&#41; themselves will also include
    similar information. As he explains it, it&#39;s really impossible to protect
    a font absolutely from being extracted, but it&#39;s also not obvious or trivial
    to do so. The audience for the application is rather small, so I&#39;m not too
    worried about it.
