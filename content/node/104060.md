  \xBBnot being visible/usable in application\xAB. It is obviously the case with fonts
  which have something special in their Style name, such as \u201CScriptive\u201D
  instead of \u201CItalics\u201D, for instance.\r\nI guess the problem is well-known.
  But I wonder what strategies might be chosen to circumvent this conundrum. \r\nAny
  hints appreciated."

  body: Don't put anything in the Style name other than Regular, Italic, Bold or Bold
    Italic (which should in turn correspond to the OS/2.fsSelection bit style setting).
    If you want to use some different style naming system, this should be employed
    in the OpenType preferred family and subfamily name fields.
