body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Yes folks, yet another one infected by the typo-bug. I&#39;m a
  newbie typophile who may need some help and feedback. I started experimenting with
  bitmap fonts couple of months ago. I thought bitmap fonts are simple to create,
  so it may be a good starting point. I have worked on several bitmap projects until
  the sobering discovery that some else had quite the same ideas at pixel pushing.
  It is excrutiatingly difficult to come up with a new typeface of different look
  especially at very small sizes. Pixel Lattice is one of my favourits. Although the
  original idea to place the letters on a pixel grid is not mine, I think I succeded
  to add some new twists to take it to the next level. &#40;To those who may object
  the use of swastica for the glyph &#34;X&#34; and the asterisk, I can tell beforehand
  that this is not identical to the Nazi symbol, which turns the other way around.&#41;  <BR>
  <BR>Any comment? <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14014.gif"

  body: nice. But, as you predicted, the swastica. People will not realise that this
    is &#39;the right&#39; swastica. They will see the bad one. It&#39;s the general
    form that count, and it really looks like the bad swastica. Maybe you should change
    it.  <BR>Go more in the direction of the lc &#39;x&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: On the other hand, perhaps this is just the sort of thing to slowly filter
    the use in a new context? I didn&#39;t notice it until I read your email, Ren.
    I was looking at the alphabet as a whole, first and each character second. And
    for how often a cap X would appear. Well, just thoughts.  <BR> <BR>Although, I
    realize, the safest option in order to separate this from the baggage that comes
    with the swastika, is to alter your cap X.

  body: I would lose the &#34;swastika&#34; most definately. Perhaps try a bitmapped
    hourglass approach. I like the look overall.

  body: So, are Hindus and other people who bumped into the gridiform cross before
    Mr. Hitler required to forget all about it? <BR> <BR>Balls. <BR> <BR>Keep it Tibor,
    Moholy would have. Just make SURE you include a linked etymology in all descriptions.
    It is possible to take words, characters and forms back from offensive usage,
    especially those that are simple and naturally inspired. <BR> <BR>the Void is
    hungry and wants its twisty grid cross back.

  body: though, it would help if you did not replicate the Nazi cross in dimension
    as well as form. Add an extra pixel to the ends of all 4 legs, and it will be
    clear you are drawing something different. I think eyes on this board register
    your EXACT replication of the height/width of the reviled swastika. Spoil that,
    and you&#39;re on the way to a new definition. <BR> <BR>sorry to be such a blabber.
