  designer, calligrapher, and artist, 1876-1934.\r\n\r\nDesigned both [[blackletter]]
  and [[roman]] alphabets. Strongly [[Christian]] (and Lutheran Protestant) as well
  as an exponent of  [[German nationalism]] in the arts, Koch had an affinity for
  the [[Arts &amp; Crafts]] movement spearheaded by [[William Morris]]. Some of his
  art, as well as his typefaces, have a strongly [[Art Nouveau]] flavor. Koch's great
  passion was infusing the stately opulence of [[Baroque]] forms with the raw energy
  of the [[Romantic]], and his most well-known typefaces, The [[Deutsche Schrift]]
  family (also kown as [[Koch Schrift]]), [[Maximillian]], [[Wilhelm Klingspor Schrift]],
  [[Neuland]], [[Jessen]], [[Wallau]], [[Koch Antiqua]], [[Fr\xFChling]], [[Holla]],
  [[Zepelin]], [[Prisma]], [[Offenbach]], [[Marathon]], [[Koch Kursiv]] and [[Kabel]]
  all have this balance between elegance and raw energy.\r\n\r\nKoch was an in-house
  designer at the Gebr. [[Klingspor]] foundry from 1906 until his death in 1934 (with
  a short gap for service in the first World War). All of his typefaces were released
  by Klingspor. After the Klingspor foundry closed in the late 1950s, the foundry
  [[D. Stempel AG]] in Frankfurt, who had owned the Klingspor foundry for over a decade,
  assumed the rights to the designs and continued the distribution of the commercial
  successful ones. \r\n\r\nKoch was also concerned that with the development of industrial
  typography in the form of [[hot metal typesetting]] much of typefounding's history
  might be lost. He was a gifted historian, and many of the most well-known illustrations
  of traditional [[punchcutting]] were drawn by him. He also produced a large volume
  of elaborately detailed, traditional German [[calligraphy]], some of it exceedingly
  beautiful. His book on calligraphic instruction <em>[[Das Schreiben als Kunstfertigkeit]]</em>
  is still one of the best works on the subject ever printed in the German language,
  and is worth a look for non-German readers as well, even though it is almost entirely
  focused on [[Blackletter]] hands. The book was one of the catalysts that began the
  career of [[Hermann Zapf]], as well as that of  his wife, [[Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse]].\r\n\r\nIt
  would be a mistake, however, to peg Koch as a strict traditionalist. He was a relentless
  experimenter, seeking in particular to reconcile the traditionally popular German
  [[fraktur]] / broken-letter types with the [[antiqua]] or [[roman]] types used in
  the Western parts of Europe and the United Kingdom. Some of these experiments were
  unsuccessful, like the intriguing but ungainly [[Offenbach]], but others, such as
  [[Wallau]], were both in keeping with the spirit of the times and successful in
  their own right. Probably his most significant achievement during this time, and
  the most widely-known of his experiments, is the rough-hewn [[Neuland]], a deceptively
  sophisticated, very black lino-cut [[sans serif]] that pointed to some of the more
  expressionistic types coming from further east, such as [[Vojtech Preissig]] in
  [[Czechoslovakia]], while still being very much his own work.\r\n\r\nLate in life,
  he followed developments in the [[Bauhaus]] scene, developing his own groundbreaking
  [[Kabel]] typeface alongside [[Jakob Erbar]]'s [[Erbar]] and [[Paul Renner]]'s [[Futura]],
  as well as designing the lesser-known but equally significant [[calligraphic sans]]
  [[Stahl]], which was finished after his death by [[Hans K\xFChne]].\r\n\r\nKoch
  was also a prolific teacher. In 1908, he began teaching calligraphy at the <em>Technische
  Lehranstalten der Stadt Offenbach a.M</em>, which became the [[HfG Offenbach]] in
  1970 . His courses developed into a type of special studio, called the Offenbach
  Workshop. In addition to calligraphy, students at the workshop produced everything
  that could conceivably have lettering on it, including tapestries, metal work, and
  church bells. Like the [[Bauhaus]], the workshop developed an international reputation
  during the 1920s, attracting students from foreign countries. [[Warren Chappel]]
  studied under Koch during the 1930s there.\r\n\r\nA word should be said to Koch's
  nationalism (one should remember that nationalist feelings were common throughout
  the western world in the pre-WWII-era). Koch fought as an infantryman on both the
  western and the eastern fronts during the first World War. Reading his recollections,
  one might get the feeling that he loved every minute of it. It was also during these
  war years that Koch became increasingly devout. Rudolf Koch died in 1934. This for
  him was fortunate. Many of his students emphatically embraced Nazism, lending their
  calligraphic skills to the movement.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Koch would have
  avoided this. He had strong ties to the Jewish community in Offenbach, and on at
  least one occasion (in 1927), produced a complete Haggadah ([[Offenbacher Haggadah]]).
  The book is part of the [[Klingspor Museum]]'s collection today."
