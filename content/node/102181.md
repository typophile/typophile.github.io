  body: The new logo, [[http://tinyurl.com/cqmz2w7|as it appears here]], appears to
    be a fairly simple custom job based on any number of sans serif fonts, with different
    letters taking on characteristics of different fonts, plus some trivial modifications
    like trimming the bar on the /T.   - Herb

    identify it and agree more with Herb. Very hard to say as there's nothing really
    distinctive to me part of /K diagonal strokes meeting at the vertical and may
    be the /S shape. Could be a lot of thing from totally made from scratch to customization
    from a commercial font... Some I like: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/salvo-sans|Salvo
    Sans]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima Nova]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/locator|Locator]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/adequate|Adequate]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/co|Co]] (don't ask me why but I would probably
    start from this one), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeotones/arboria|Arboria]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/mr+eaves|Mr eaves]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]]

  body: "Thanks for the good info guys. I will do a search on some similar fonts.
    I need a very \"neutral\" font for a logo and i think i remember there was a font
    quite clean named Engravers Gothic\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/engravers-gothic-fs\r\n\r\nthat
    might also work. "

    job, the only thing simple is how simply amazing it is. For future reference when
    a big company like this gets a new font, you can find it usually embedded in their
    website and other materials. '
