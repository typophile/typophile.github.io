body: "Dear Everybody Who Loves Font,\r\n\r\nThis is my first - quite serious - attempt
  to draw a font family. \r\n\r\nBasic concept was/is to draw a Thin and Black weights
  and blend \r\nand carefully review all the weights in between.\r\n\r\nNow I like
  this - and would be glad to have any critique.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  Numerals look still something ugly for me - I'm working on it.\r\n\r\nP.S.2.: Italic
  is mainly oblique for now - except 'f' and 'f-ligas' - but\r\na few glyphs are planned
  to be redrawn."

  body: "Here are a few observations:\r\n\r\nae and OE seem clogged in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe
    curly-legged R variant seems out of place. \r\n\r\n5 looks bottom heavy. \r\n\r\noslash
    and Oslash need some adjustment for the optical illusion at the intersections.\r\n\r\n@
    is interesting!\r\n\r\nbottom terminal of e might get too thin in some weights.\r\n\r\nis
    there a different in those italic Ms?"
