    it online on any site that would be found acceptable here.

    it&#39;s odd that there are a few discrepancies between them... I thought I had
    a dead ringer.  The Y&#39;s are different, as are the E&#39;s.  After checking
    the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gamer/bold-italic/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Character Map</a>, however, the font does include the aforementioned
    differences as alternate characters.'

  body: Ryan Neary; <BR> <BR>Thanks, your find is pretty close too. If I had the money
    I&#39;d purchase it, as the &#34;Chisel&#34; font is sort of in a grey area. <BR>
    <BR>regards, <BR>klokwerk
