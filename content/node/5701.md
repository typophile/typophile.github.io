body: My freelance identity needs to be updated. For now, I have decided to continue
  to use my name. But, I&#39;ve been wondering if I should I create a business name
  &#40;would it seem more professional/substantial or just gimicky&#41;?  I know it&#39;s
  a very personal decision, but I&#39;m curious as to the process others have used
  to come up with their names, is it ok to use a private joke? Does it have to be
  something the client &#34;gets&#34;? Also, many of the other posts have debated
  over whether or not an individual should have a personal logo. I feel that as a
  graphic designer the answer is yes. Attached are 2 business card designs, please
  let me know what you think, if you have a preference, and how you think they can
  be improved upon. Thanks in advance, I value all of your input.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41082.jpg"

  body: Designing your personal identity is the hardest thing for a designer to do.
    I try and think of myself&#40;as a designer&#41; identityless. If you have no
    identity as a designer than you are flexible and organic to your clients. If you
    present a very classcal identiy to a potential client then you run the risk of
    being stereotyped as a classic designer. If you present a ultra-modern identity
    than you will alienate those clients looking for a classic feel. A designer is
    not a brand, a designer designs brands.

    - to help me improve my mark. If I just wanted to hear &#34;it&#39;s wonderful&#34;
    I&#39;d show them to my Mom. Your sensitivity on a very personal project is appreciated.
    It&#39;s definately the hardest kind of work and probably the most vunerable too.
    You&#39;re voicing many of my own concerns that have been nagging at me but I&#39;ve
    been squashing. While looking over past projects trying to determine &#34;my style&#34;
    I was a little discouraged to see no unifying look. Hopefully that is a strength
    - meeting the client&#39;s specific needs rather than imposing an pre-established
    treatment. I understand the trap David wrote of, having a classically designed
    mark and putting off cutting edge prospective clients and vice versa. However
    how does one design an identity that says &#39;I&#39;m a designer, I can do your
    project no matter your needs/style&#39;. My identity will be my first impression.
    I don&#39;t want my card to get lost in the shuffle and be mistaken for an accountant&#39;s.
    some more research will help I&#39;m sure. Does anyone have recommendations of
    good, or even bad &#40;shows you what to avoid&#41; self-identity logos?

  body: I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot and decided to explore some other
    paths. Below is what I think is working best so far, however I&#39;m not convinced
    of my type choices. I need a font with a single junction on the cap K.  So far
    I&#39;m using Gill Sans Light &#40;I don&#39;t care for the cap R in Univers or
    Futura&#41;. I&#39;m also trying two serif fonts, Perpetua and Trajan. Again I
    need a single junction K but it needs to be a face with very little contrast.
    The leg on the Trajan K seems too swash-y. It still needs to be refined and perhaps
    a different font choice &#40;Suggestions Please!&#41; But overall, I like this
    direction. What does the forum think? Is it a worthwhile initial concept? <BR>

  body: the direction you are taking with your logo is interesting, altough it seems
    underdeveloped. i like the concept, though. I think the font selection of the
    bottom design works best for your name. I do not like the way it works with &#34;graphic
    design studio.&#34; Perhaps a sans serif for contrast? I&#39;m not sure, i would
    just experiment with a few more options. <BR> <BR>is this an actual business card
    design? if so, i would consider going back to the drawing board for something

    version was the creation of the triangle out of the stacked KN mark and the type.
    The new shape even repeats the K from the mark when the card is held on the vertical.
    Perhaps it&#39;s too subtle. My intention was to find the right font and then
    refine the layout which will also need to be applied to other formats - it may
    not work on a letterhead design. Should I continue or go back to the drawing board?  '

  body: Here are some new identity designs. What I had liked about my last post was
    using a simple grahic element along with the name, although the stylized K and
    N weren&#39;t working. They did however remind me of signal flags so I looked
    up what the signal flags would be for my initals and incorporated them into most
    of the attached designs. Signal flags are a form of visual communication which
    is what graphic design is all about. The K flag means I want to communicate with
    you. But the N flag stands for no or negative - not  a great concept to associate
    with one&#39;s id. however, historically it also used to symbolize rendezvous.
    I don&#39;t expect a lot of people to actually decypher the flag symbols. I do
    hope it will be fairly self evident that they represent K and N, but the flags
    are simple enough to just be graphic elements. Also, a subtle nautical theme seems
    appropriate on a personal level. But that goes back to some of my original questions,
    how reflective/personal should a personal identity be? Any way, your thoughts
    on this latest round would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41861.jpg"

    not understand what these symbols mean. I know i wouldn&#39;t if you hadn&#39;t

    it would leave me wondering. The symbols itself don&#39;t feel like they are a
    mark since they are not connected graphically. Thus, forgetting about the original
    meaning, if it was just one of the flags i would agree that it is a symbol that
    could exist simply as looking nice. <BR> <BR>From the choices you posted i like
    the first ones most, with the flags in the middle. This arrangement holds the
    flags together and makes it feel more solid. <BR> <BR>Personally however, i am
    a little sad you are walking away from your original approach. Your name has a

    gaudy design? It takes a real designer to create an dynamic composition with very
    few elements that is logical and considerate of the content and the viewing audience.
    Kirsten, if you have some class, which I&#39;m sure you do, then you won&#39;t
    have to bombard your clients and friends with an overly designed identity that
    is designed for designs sake. LESS IS MORE. Lure them in with sophistication and
    class. Concentrate on typesetting and simplicity. Make beautiful words at considerate
    point sizes in a considerate legible clean typeface. When I see great buisness
    card it is done with extreme class and a very slight but elegant touch of style.

    is a graphic designer and her clients want to get a taste of her skills. If she

    direction here. If I understand David correctly, I think he may have read a little
    too much into Tom&#39;s &#34;billboard&#34; comment. I agree with David, in that
    a designer&#39;s identity shouldn&#39;t alienate clients by overdesigning too
    much of their own unique style into it &#40;unless the designer wants to specialize
    and their objective is to target a very specific clientelle&#41;; but, I also
    agree with Tom, in that a business card can play a very powerful role in making
    or breaking a meaningful marketing or communications opportunity between you and
    a potential client. Afterall, most of us don&#39;t have much of a budget for marketing
    and signage, and until you get a client into your door, there is a good chance
    they will never see your portfolio. In my personal experience, only about 10%
    or less of my clients ever see my portfolio. My visual portfolio has yet to make
    a difference in whether or not I land a job. What I would call my relationship/experience
    portfolio is what brings in the work, or rather, results in the referrals that
    keep me working. <BR> <BR>I apologize for taking up so much of your critique space
    here, Kirsten, but this seems to be a worthwhile discussion. <BR> <BR>Below is
    my logo on my stationary suite &#40;a product of this forum&#41;. I am posting
    this because it supports the points that both David and Tom have made. The logotype
    is a derivative of Clarendon, which is a timeless typeface with subtle enough
    alteration that I believe David would approve of it. The stationary suite, however,
    is a selling tool. I use the two PMS colors, die cutting/punch cutting &#40;&#34;Q&#34;
    and radius corners&#41;, letterpress, and stock selection as an example of how
    I can customize a piece that all of my clients use, but few of them have capitalized
    on for differentiation. Of course there are better pieces to illustrate this,
    but I can&#39;t carry them around wherever I go. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41992.jpg"

    also his creativity and strong sense of color to create an attractive presentation.
    It would not have the same effect if he just used Claredon without customizing
    it and making it unique.  <BR> <BR>Also, billboards can be made to look appealing
    and classy. It all depends on who you are marketing to. My experience with clients
    has been that they care more for graphics than the kerning &#40;not that you can&#39;t
    do both&#41;. Our job as GRAPHIC designers is to show that we can use type as
    well as graphics &#40;usually&#41; to get a point across. Clients I have had want
    to see creativity. How else are you going to seperate yourself from their local
    print shop?

    having one character with a twist and hopefully it&#39;s contrast to the roman
    will be a reminder of the correct spelling and pronuncation. The first posting
    is the logotype itself followed by possible business card applications. I thought
    about Daniel&#39;s comment about process and so, two cards have a die-cut and
    fold. I haven&#39;t decided upon colors yet, so if some of the shades appear different
    it&#39;s not your monitor nor your eves. Finally, I tried to rework the flag concept
    into something I like but nothing was successful. I kept hearing David&#39;s and

    kerned way to tight. Think about the Negative Space. Right now the negative space
    is being crammed by the positive spave. I would try Adding one full natural space
    in between the letters and see how it feels. IMPO an all small caps version is
    better than an all Caps/Small Caps version. I think you might disagree but when
    you open up the letterspacing you will see why I feel that in my gut. the K and
    the N are way too dominant. The italic i should be the subtly dominant feature
    of your logo. right now the K and N are cramming the i&#39;s elegance. Give the
    i some breathing room!

    representative of a Classic/Modern serif face. It kind of falls in that Century

    sold on Miller but the more I look at it the more it&#39;s growning on me. And
    if it ends up being my final choice I will see if there&#39;s a small caps version.

    has been a tremendous help. I like the suggestion of using itals for the other
    info. &#40;was starting to play with which sans would work with my last 4 font
