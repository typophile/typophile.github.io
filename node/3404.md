body: Hi, this is a logo I&#39;m working on for dwfc.org. I&#39;m on a team that may
  be doing a complete overhaul and branding for their company and was hoping to get
  some early critiques. I haven&#39;t put too much work into this... only a couple
  hours. I&#39;m open to font ideas and any comments on the idea overall. &#40;I&#39;m
  not a big drywall fanatic; my google research on &#34;drywall&#34; brought up a
  lot of those paste spatulas which are used for spreading the goo over the seams...
  so I thought I&#39;d work one in.&#41; The colors are not set in stone, as we have
  ZERO feedback on that from the company yet. I just need some prelim ideas. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks!

  body: Thanks, Tiffany... I thought about that not working but then stupidly tried
    anyway.  Seeing the logo online already gives me some ideas, but I&#39;ll see
    what everyone else has to say...

    your thumbnails up to this point. Just so we can understand the direction so far.

    you can see, I started with a different font just to get the layout basically
    the way i wanted it, and for a while the Spatula handle conformed to the color
    of the D and the W...  Oh, and my very earliest version didn&#39;t have the negative
    space in the D. <BR> <BR>But, other than that.. this is what I got right out of
    the gate.  '

  body: Right off the top of my head, I wonder if an acronym is the best way to go.
    Are they known by this, or are they known by their name proper?

  body: 'Well, my thinking behind that: <BR> <BR>Basically, Drywall Finishing Council
    is a group of people who oversee standards in drywall finishing materials for
    the industry.  I think they&#39;re probably known mainly by members of the Drywall
    community.  &#40;Hehe&#41;  Anyway, I was using the fact that they used the acronym
    dwfc as their domain name as a basis for using it in their logo.  Do you have
    suggestions other than utilizing dwfc?  Unfortunately, Drywall Finishing doesn&#39;t
    conjure a lot of graphic images in my mind, which is another reason why I went
    with dwfc, while incorporating the one notworthy graphic element that I could
    consistently find in searches.  '

  body: 'Brian: <BR> <BR>An acronym is commonly used for a group, such as a &#34;Council&#34;,
    but DWFC is not an acronym friendly title, meaning that it doesn&#39;t flow. &#34;W&#34;
    rarely lends itself to a nice sounding acronym &#40;exception, A&amp;W Rootbeer&#41;.
    DFC is not bad, but unfortunately, it isn&#39;t consistent with their URL. <BR>
    <BR>RE: &#34;Drywall Finishing doesn&#39;t conjure a lot of graphic images in
    my mind&#34; <BR> <BR>Have you considered doing a strictly typographical logo?
    This would be an appropriate approach for a &#34;Council&#34;. Maybe a very simple
    shape such as a trapazoid &#40;representing an angled sheet of drywall&#41; could
    be incorporated'

    friend was mistakenly under the impression that I was still trying to convey DWFC
    in the last logo and searching in vain for a W and F, so... I thought this might
    help get rid of that association.&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27660.gif"

  body: Grey background keeps making it apparent that i&#39;m cutting corners in order
    to rush...  Final versions will of course have the white areas cut out completely,
    so that it&#39;s technically possible for the logo to be against something OTHER
    than a white background... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27663.gif"

  body: Brian, your logo looks like you are selling drywall products. Too Commercial.
    I suggest you find out what the goals of the council are. I think an all type
    logo would probably be appropriate.
