  So I am a huge fan of Hanging Figures (or lowercase figures, or old style, whatever).
  I know that some sans faces have them, but many don't.\r\n\r\nI have altered the
  numerals for the Trade Gothic Condensed to make the numerals look better with the
  all lowercase text. Still, I know better than to alter a typeface.\r\n\r\nI would
  like to know if this is just dead wrong, is it okay? I didn't squish any letterforms..
  I actually manipulated some of the anchor points. Part of me is ticked with myself
  for thinking about it, and another part likes the way it looks.\r\n\r\nPlease tell
  me what you think?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nevan"

    cents:\r\n\r\nin general, i'm all for customizing - font designers may cringe,
    but sometimes you just have to tweak something a little. it can be tricky but
    the challenge is the fun. i'm also a big fan of hanging figures and have customized
    a few non-hangers in my day.\r\n\r\nin your example, however, i'm not sure the
    font supports it. in particular, the top curve of the 2 in its unaltered state
    doesn't seem to match the altered curves of the others (5,3,8,6). i suspect that
    the integrity of these numerals in their unaltered state is strong enough to resist
    modification. \r\n\r\nsince you're mixing fonts, perhaps there is a sans with
    hanging figures ?\r\n\r\na quick search found these examples:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hangers_5397.png]"

  body: "to my eye, as adnix says, the 1 and 2 are off, but so too are the 3 and 6,
    7. The 4 isn't working either, & as a guess, if we could see it, the 9 is probably
    not quite right either. None of it too far of, but far enough to make them look
    odd. \r\n\r\nAll this could be be fixed. I've done it for several fonts with reasonable
    success, and I'm not that good at originating glyphs. FWIW, the \"2\" is usually
    the hardest."

  body: "FWIW, I think these old-style numerals tend to look nicer in styles where
    the ascender of the 6 and the descender of the 9 are just gentle sweeps (as in
    most of Chris' suggestions above), and not so good in those where they curl back
    inwards \u2013 as in the Trade Gothic Cond that you've been working with.\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver
