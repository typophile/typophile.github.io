  body: "Hello Kristian,\r\n\r\nI had the same problem, month, maybe a year ago. But
    as far as I can remember thas was not a problem bound to FontLab. I remember TextEdit
    had the same strange problem.\r\n\r\nThe bad news, I\u2019m not 100% sure how
    I resolved the problem. Don\u2019t let me say something wrong, but I think, when
    I installed a newer driver version for Intuos (I have a 4) the problem was still
    there. But when I installed an older driver it worked again.\r\n\r\nHave you installed
    the newest driver for Intuos?\r\nIt sounds crazy, but try to install an older
    driver.\r\n\r\nThomas"

      you Thomas,\r\n\r\nI tried a couple of legacy drivers (6.3.6-w3 and 6.3.5-3)
      but the problem is that they don\u2019t seem to be supported i Mavricks :-/\r\n\r\nK."

        not TextEdit.\r\nWell, I\u2019m on Mountain Lion and using the 6.3.3.-3 drivers.\r\n\r\nSo,
        good to know, that updating to Mavericks isn\u2019t a good idea, for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas"
