  this is the first time I found only available for Apple sysytems. Does anyonne know
  if there's a Similar version to this for Windows, or is there simply a windows version
  of this font and somehow I missed this?\r\nThank you!"

    currently is not available for sale by third-party firms.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar
    font free for personal use is SilkRoad http://www.dafont.com/silkroad.font\r\nBlemished
    has a rough look as well: http://www.dafont.com/blemished.font\r\nLastly, To Forgive
    is of the same ilk as the others: http://www.dafont.com/to-forgive.font\r\n\r\nHope
