    depending on how nice you are, possibly more <BR>so. I&#39;m actually quite surprised
    this year&#39;s was made  <BR>worse. it seems that the dated trendiness of the
    former <BR>is actually a few years ahead of the latter -- odd choice.

    on the swoosh no more site, but no luck. <BR> <BR>The name of the company alone
    should go into the hall of shame. <BR> <BR>Swooshtastic! Frutigerrific! <BR> <BR><img

    unsolicited reaction to your recent redesign. <BR>My rating: 3.5 Stars <BR> <BR>What&#39;s
    good: <BR>_ You added MPAA ratings to the queue. Yay. &#40;Now, please  <BR>add
    them to the other movie listings, and not just the  <BR>&#39;detail&#39; page.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>_ The help section is much more clear. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s bad: <BR>_
    The search function is not on every page? Is this omission  <BR>an accident?!
    <BR> <BR>_ You still haven&#39;t made an easy way for me to see my own  <BR>ratings.
    This is an excellent feature that is still buried in the  <BR>site &#40;difficult
    to find&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>ABOUT THE VISUAL DESIGN <BR> <BR>_ The poorly compressed
    photos at the top of every page  <BR>are both bad stock photos and are compressed
    poorly.  <BR>Either get a phototography budget or lose them &#40;please&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>_ The chrome tabs are a nice touch, and I can live with the  <BR>soft
    buttons, but the curvy shapes should go--you&#39;re back  <BR>to 1999 here. <BR>
    <BR>_ Futura? I know the logo is Futura-influenced, but the  <BR>pages use Futura
    and Arial &#40;HTML&#41; headers interchangably.  <BR>Ick. &#40;Just stick to
    HTML.&#41; <BR> <BR>_ You didn&#39;t change the logo! Yay. The red and the logo
    are  <BR>the pillars of your corporate identity. Don&#39;t lose them as  <BR>you
    stray from MarchFirst&#39;s original design. <BR> <BR> <BR>Love the service, looking
    forward to the next phase. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR> <BR>Joseph Pemberton <BR>A

    I feel like I care too. <BR> <BR>Lets take for example, a date I was recently
    on, with a nice young attractive girl. We went to a nice place -- with an outstanding
    wine selection I might add -- and after one glance at this menu, I am like &#34;Wtf?
    fake small caps? Im suppose to pay $50&#43; per ala carte entree and I can even
    get a half way decent set menu? <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/proud.gif"

    for several free meals you&#39;ll design them a better menu. <BR> <BR>Point out
    of course, all the horrible things such as the faux small caps and such, and make
    it sound like it&#39;s the worst thing in the world. <BR> <BR>heh

    proper things when I get a chance, such as true ordinals and whatnot.
