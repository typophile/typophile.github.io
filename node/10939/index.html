		<div class="commentbody">Hello Luis and congratulations for the type face, good starting. I also want to make some suggestings and questions. The l/c x have different expessures, which is visible if you use as a display font, but is looking great with small sizes. I prefere to see that kind of forms a relation betten then which create a better uniformity for all letters, for exemple ( use the letter (o) to create the bowl of the (g), (b), (d), (p), (q), or using the letter (n) to give the aperture and struture for the (y),(u).  <BR> <BR>1 &gt; Did you use any over-shoot (baseline overshoot, x-height overshoot ) to differentiate the limits of the round parts?  <BR> <BR>2 &gt; How you make the relation betten letters when use the round terminal ( b, e, q).  <BR> <BR>Its very interesting your type face and I want to see how your serene grow up during the time.  <BR>Boa aparição Luis e força com esta tua bonita tipografia / Comprimentos.  <BR> <BR>Ricardo Santos</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If this is your first effort, I think you have great instincts - make sure they survive your upcoming &quot;formal&quot; learning effort. <BR> <BR>I'd go further than Stephen and say that I think there are actually too many good ideas here! They're fighting for attention, and I think more discipline would create more functionality. So I'd spread out the good ideas over multiple fonts*, instead of maybe trying to make one &quot;ultimate&quot; font (which never works). For example, your &quot;e&quot; has a nice organic feel, and the stem on your &quot;o&quot; is amazing, but together they're maybe too much of a good thing. And then there are some glyphs which are a bit *too* plain, like the &quot;x&quot; I think has a lot more potential. <BR> <BR>* Maybe a set of fonts that work together? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

And inverting the existing &quot;n&quot; could be an interesting approach to the &quot;u&quot;, especially with how that would position the &quot;u&quot;'s tail. A similar treatment could be adapted to the &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. <BR> <BR>I'm excited to see what you do with this font. <BR> <BR>David</div>

IMO some display type gets boring when all of the characters are too identical in nature. Make sense?</div>
