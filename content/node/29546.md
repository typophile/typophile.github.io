  body: "To me this looks like it could be made up from parts of Chalet, with the
    exception of the 'a' and 'p', which I think were custom drawn. I could find no
    sans serif faces with those two letters drawn that way, in a search of over 800
    families.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Looks very amateurish to me -- check that 's' and 'g'. My money on it being
    a freefont.

    by an Irwin McFadden in the 1970s for Iowa University:\r\n\r\n<a>http://www.flickr.com/photos/20745656@N00/265249767/in/set-72157594328005325/</a>\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/20745656@N00/282443236/\r\n\r\nIt
    does look a lot like parts of Chalet.\r\n\r\nCan't find anywhere it's available
    but It'd be interesting to know if anyone knows any more about Mcfadden."
