  body: "You need to make up another glyph -- a small cap I with a dot. BTW, in naming
    it, you shouldn't use the underline. That is by convention reserved for ligatures.
    Use a period. For example:\r\n\r\nIdotted.sc, or even I.dotted.sc,\r\n\r\nThen,
    with c2sc, for the dotted capital I, substitute your new glyph. For the standard
    Capital I, substitute I.sc That works whether you have Turkish or not.\r\n\r\nLower
    case (generally the smcp feature) is trickier -- the normal Latin dotted i has
    to be substituted with the new glyph,  Idotted.sc. The dottless i gets the regular
    I.sc\r\n\r\nProblem is, when & how to do it? Most anything will be a hack. I'd
    be tempted to use a stylistic set before the smcp feature, to be switched on when
    setting Turkish. Then the smcp feature gets the normal substitution, Latin lowercase
    \"i\" to \"I.sc\". As the stylistic set occurs before smcp, and is \"on,\" it
    just won't be found in smcp, so won't cause a problem.\r\n\r\nWhether to make
    up a language-specific substitution depends -- most users won't put in language
    tags. And it could muck up your smcp feature for setting any other language. Remember
    that even though you write the code, the application program has to support it...\r\n\r\n
    \r\nBTW Nick, your treatment of ligatures makes no sense unless you also have
    the other characters needed for Turkish -- The dotted capital I (& small cap,
    if you want; the G,g breve; etc.If you don't have these, why worry about the ligaturing?\r\n\r\n&
    if there is room between x-heigth and ascender height, you can use ligatures.
    I made up a dotted \"i\" for a f_i ligature in Bembo once -- it worked just fine.
    The standard lig was used in Turkish with an undotted i.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "I'm no expert on this. Here's the reason I'm no expert: for over 30 yeas,
    our company has set books published by university presses. Even with OpenType,
    I have *never* seen language tags in a file. Moreover, there is often more than
    one language used, or more than one dialect of a language, or the text might be
    in English, with an occasional word or phrase in other languages.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    an author creating a a final product -- web or print -- I guess language tags
    would work. If the document is going through an editor or designer or typesetter,
    you'd have a lot of talking to do with each. Esp. the designer, who's apt to choose
    a typeface that doesn't support the languages involved. Happens every damn day.\r\n\r\nIf
    you use a stylistic set (above the scmp feature), all you need is a readme in
    the distributed font files. Then, as Dr. House would say, only idiots & morons
    would get it wrong..."

  body: "I always take care to set the correct language to texts of more than a single
    word long -- well, or at least to entire <em>paragraphs</em>. (If there are lots
    of single long foreign words in a text I just check the ones that get hyphenated.)\r\nInDesign
    supports \"applied language\" for Opentype features; and it behaves correctly
    with capitalized Turkish text as well as the dreaded \"fi\" ligature (of course
    only when the font designer did it right!).\r\n\r\nI'm curious, though, why designers
    think a clashing \"fi\" is bad in general but okay for Turkish! In the one single
    font I made, I created a short-topped \"f\" character specifically to use in this
    case.\r\n"

  body: "On the ligatures -- no one's ever satisfied.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/34200\r\n\r\nSo,
    Minerva, following that assumption, you can create a separate lookup for small
    caps in the smcp feature that is turned on only when the Turkish language tag
    has been applied.\r\n\r\nTheunis -- congratulation, by the way, for taking the
    time & having the knowledge to tag all the words in a long file with the correct
    language. Time is part of it -- we may have a book with 1,000 or more Spanish
    words --  all untagged coming in, and usually single words or short phrases. I
    just create an exception dictionary for the job which blocks hyphenation on words
    like barrio. We always create an exception dictionary that contains every word
    over five letters. Sadly, InDesign allows hyphenation before a single vowel in
    English, and that's a not allowed in our world, which is based on the Chicago
    <cite>Manual of Style<cite>. There are other reasons for the custom dictionary,
    of course.\r\n\r\nAnd I have to admit, as an American,  I'm not always sure, say,
    \ what's Swiss & what's German; what's Danish or Norwegian, etc., unless an author's
    directly given the language.  The latter is esp. shameful for me, as my father's
    first language was Norwegian...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I set scholarly material, and I get a lot of manuscripts in *.doc or *.docx
    format with various language attributes set.  Sometimes this is useful, often
    not, but enough are useful that I preserve attributes when pulling the files into
    InDesign.  Early on, these seemed to be files from East Asian versions of MS Word,
    with \"Japanese\" or some variant of \"Chinese\" applied to text that was mostly
    alphabetic.  The most noticeable effect, of course, is to turn off ID's hyphenation;
    more subtle, ID picks up (and can re-use) language attributes that were not part
    of the original installation -- so far as I know, that's the simplest way to get
    the CJK attributes into English-language ID.\r\n\r\nMore recently, as authors
    pull stuff in from all over the web, files show up with all kinds of attributes.
    \ And it seems that if they continue typing from the insertion point without changing
    the language back to that of their main text, the typed additions pick up the
    insertion's language attribute.  Neither authors nor editors notice, of course.
    \ For me, the the most noticeable effect is again on hyphenation.\r\n\r\nThe trouble
    is, ID's search routine only works for specific language attributes.  The simplest
    way to find out which are used in an InDesign story must be Rorohiko's [[http://www.rorohiko.com/wordpress/indesign-downloads/framereporter/|Frame
    Reporter]].  (I confess I haven't tried this yet -- I keep thinking I'll move
    to IDCS5.5 as soon as Adobe fixes the pagination/indexing bugs).  Jongware was
    kind enough to note (over at InDesign Secrets) that scripting this task say to
    run quickly on entire ID files was \"[[http://indesignsecrets.com/forum/indesign-add-ons-scripts-scripting-and-plug-ins/script-to-change-the-language-of-all-text-on-document?value=3291&type=8&include=0&search=1&ret=all#7657|tricky]].\"
    \ But he'd earlier provided a simple script over on the Adobe Forums [[http://forums.adobe.com/message/3279054#3279054|that
    can do it]], albeit slowly --  I go warm up my coffee in the microwave.\r\n\r\nDavid"
