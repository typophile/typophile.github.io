  body: "Angel, you are probably right, but I found there is a similarity to [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Karmina&x=16&y=4&sample_text=Senior%20Alliance|Karmina]].
    Closer looking shows that Karmina's details are different, perhaps a bit more
    refined, but the general structure is quite similar, at least in these letters.
    The most obvious disconnect is the 'e', with its slightly angled crossbar.\r\n\r\n-
