  cards for me. I'd prefer a local company (Los Angeles area). It seems like Aardvark
  is pretty well respected.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recommend a different company or have
  any comments or advice on where to go?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Thanks warmly for the heads-up Beth.\r\n\r\nI've been doing letterpress (both
    metal and PPL) for a few years now, although my volume (read: experience) isn't
    monumental. Which however is exactly the reason my rates are also not monumental.
    :-)  On the other hand I try not to skimp on taste or quality; here are a couple
    of (rather poor) shots of something I printed last month - my new business cards:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newcard1_4755.jpg]\r\n\r\n(The
    back of the card is burgundy matching the color of the logo.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newcard2_5362.jpg]\r\n\r\nJonathan,
    I would be quite glad to take on your letterpress project.\r\nPlease email me
    at your leisure: hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    wonderful. And their colors are quite striking if that is something of interest
    to you. Just pay thr few bucks to get premium without their logo on the back\r\n\r\nI
    always get a small rubber stanmp while I'm at ordering <a href=\"http://businesscardsabc.com\"

    I have one in every desk! hehehe\r\n"
