  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Has anyone noticed that in a mixed case sentence the caps seem to have not only a slightly different angular degree, but also weight? We&rsquo;ve just bought Freight for a project and noticed this slight oddity. Is it our laser printer or is there a slight visual difference somehow? The caps all seem slighly thicker. Is this somehow a weird trick of the eye or a peculiarity to the face? Any thoughts welcomed</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Claus, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a &ldquo;norm&rdquo;. Mostly I would call it old-fashioned, often purposefully. But it can work - in fact there are two functional reasons why caps that stand out can make sense: it makes it easier to spot names when scanning a text, which is what scanning is usually for; and all-caps text, which tries to be strong, looks stronger.</p>
<p>Jonathan, caveat emptor I guess.
I think it&rsquo;s a great font overall, but know what you&rsquo;re buying.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is the norm to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->higher or lesser extent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as I said. The stroke thickness difference between uppercase and lowercase characters have always been present in type. Some (stylistic) periods have accentuated this difference, others have minimized it, but it it always there. As Hrant says, one explanation can be a desire to differentiate proper nouns or nouns in languages as German where they are capitalized. Another explanation is the desire to adjust the stroke of the characters so they would be more uniform in colour, as uppercase letters have larger negative spaces and thus require a darker positive space to achieve a harmonious co-existence with the lowercase. If the stroke of the uppercase is identical with the lowercase in absolute terms then the uppercase letters would look too thin. The Freight text fonts draw inspiration from the Dutch Fleischman typeface, which by contemporary sensibilities look dated, but them are the breaks.</p>
<p>Regarding the angles of the italic down-strokes, the story is much the same. The variations are there for reasons of optical adjustment, period sensibilities (and print-technical reasons I ponder).</p>
<p>So no, you haven&rsquo;t bought a pig in a poke. Freight text is meant for&hellip; text. Not display setting. So when you zoom in to the details of Freight they might look strange and illogical, but they are there because they work when set in normal text sizes. Freight has a selection of complementary faces for display use that might come in handy in your case.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a difference between doing that a little bit to avoid the caps looking too thin in relation to the lc (as you explain further along) versus doing that an extra amount so that the caps stand out. In fact the two are pretty much opposed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in languages as German</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hold on, German is actually a language where my point doesn&rsquo;t apply, since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nouns<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are capitalized, not just names. German is no good for scanning.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s strange though is that -looking at the Enschede 1908 book- Fleischmann&rsquo;s own Italics don&rsquo;t exhibit unusually dark or less slanted caps!
So Darden must have done it for another reason&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the angles of the italic down-strokes &hellip;

</blockquote>
<p>This I&rsquo;m not seeing.
I suspect the reason Italic caps were historically often slanted less than the lc was to avoid collisions with the metal kerns. But the &ldquo;standing out&rdquo; aspect might apply as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freight text is meant for&hellip; text. Not display setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly a very good point. Jonathan, there&rsquo;s a severe limit to how much a person (especially a non-type-designer) can consciously gauge what works and what doesn&rsquo;t in a text face by focusing on individual features/letters, essentially because immersive reading is subconsious. To some extent you have to resist that temptation.</p>
