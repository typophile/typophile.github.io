Not only that, but if you look up other commercial fonts, many are even listed by their real names, and cite the actual (real, as in not pirated) copywrites.  This is honestly ridiculous.

If I had a blood pressure pill, I'd send it over!

I've stumbled on a similar site a few times that is also Russian and they freely give away fonts with immunity. I don't know if there are any regulations for downloading pirated fonts from places like Russia where such laws don't exist.

On a lighter note, Someone who was interested in my font Memoir posted on Abstract Fonts and was encouraged to buy it by another forum member.

I think the idea is to not make things even easier to find, Katelynn... If past threads are any indication, most (if not all) of the Typophile moderators follow this line of thinking.

I too have noticed that the "Edit" buttons disappear after a while, so maybe deleting the image is a task for a moderator at this point.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While we are playing nice and protective here, the dregs of font pirating society are out there trading favors and websites like hos.

Let's put it this way.

Our actions: One drop of rain just fell on the ocean. 

My thought is that as a Type community we need to be vigilant, not just seeing who can id the latest font request. We should be searching out free sites, questionable sites etc.... acting as a protective community.

How about we form some search and destroy teams. TAAD - Typophiles Against Alphabet Defrauders, kinda like MADD.

When we catch them we can have Sister Tiffany (formally Miss Tiffany) beat their knuckles with a Pica ruler and report them to the Great and Omnipotent Ampersand for judgement. The Great Ampersand, known as E.T., will then handcuff their BCP's,  correct their path direction and resign them to the first version of Font Studio. 

When someone steals my fonts all I have left is my sense of humor, sick as it is!

You’d be better off just focusing on producing new fonts. Spend all the time you want trying to get your fonts of the various crummy free font websites out there and it still won’t get your fonts off Usenet, ftp servers, torrent sites, etc, which is probably where they’re coming from before they end up on free font web sites. Do what the rest of the software industry has done—either find a way to exploit piracy as promotion, or just ignore it entirely, because you can’t beat pirates.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I read this site everyday for months, but this thread made my to register.

typerror, there are plenty of warez forums, there are closed community, there are more opened ones, mostly they host on rapidshare and likes(eg. they host the files of fonts), but if russian, they host on russian servers as they don't have copyright law for internet and nobody cares too. And then there are irc channels, from where you can get freshest released fonts by groups, they are pure ones, no extracts from pdf's(as they buy those fonts, to give it for free to others.) And if you are deep into warez thing there are ftp's with basically everything on them - it is warez scheme for everithing, not only fonts.
So, I don't think that anyone should care about extracts(from pdfs) as mostly fonts dont have all glyphs and all weights, and sadly there are nothing you can do about the real fonts out there(you can ask thou, to the uploader via mail or pm not to upload, they all are grown up ppl, and I think that most of them will listen to you). 
And its not true that those fonts are corrupted, mostly they are pure files, as the community tend to clean the "scene" from bad fonts.
So, why I know this all - because I live in Latvia :D Im glad, that I work at company that license fonts used in projects, but 80% of companies does not. But it is how it is, because life here sux.
And, at the end, I want to say, that piracy doesnt means that you loose money(it is speculatively and wrong to say that) as many ppl try fonts, and if they loves them, they buy license. As I wont buy 4 fonts, to just show them to client in real life, but I buy the one client chooses. Maybe its wrong, but I love typography and its not possible to license every font on my computer.
And I feel sorry that you need to see you work pirated, I Know how you feel!</div>

Which community?

"You might as well say “Relax, it’s just your ability to get food, shelter and clothing.”"

Only valid if 'pirates' were actually affecting one's ability to get food, shelter and clothing. 

Just had huge battle with Adobe to get some software I had purchased installed. Adobe's insane registration/serial "anti-piracy" system pretty much convinced me that I have little interest in giving Adobe much of my business. 

'Relax, it's just a font' is probably saner advice than 'worry, panic, and spend pointless hours obsessing about an issue you have little to not control over'. ;o)

"that I should design even more fonts to offset the losses of the ones that are being pirated. What school of economics is that?"

My neighbor owns a small shop near us. Sadly shoplifting is a fact of life, the cost of which is shared amongst the paying customers. This annoys her and the paying customers. However, on occasions she’s able to catch a thief in the act and call the authorities. 

Why would you deny a type designer the right to being vigilant? Why would you tell paying customers that subsidizing the pirates is okay?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">shoplifting, alas, is a flawed argument. There is a tangible loss of a sale for each unit taken.

that doesn't exist with digital copies. For each font downloaded from that Russian site, is that one sale that would have happened? Odds are, probably not. Granted, there's really no way to tell.

"Why would you deny a type designer the right to being vigilant?"

I'm not. I'm saying that it's a rather futile endeavor to go after 'font collectors' who are swapping 1000s of fonts out there on the web. So, it can be a lot of effort for no real result.

Go after commercial theft...design firms using illicit fonts for ad campaigns. Those are more likely real losses of sales. 

Ultimately, if one is selling digital media, they need to realize that the technology allows for unlimited copying. That's just the way it is. So the business model needs to cater to that. What some are saying (including myself) is that it's probably best to cater to the professional, paying market. Put attention towards those customers...not the 'possible' customer of anonymous kids in Russia who swap fonts to make gig flyers.
