    it much worse. I can't stress how important it is to work <strong>ONLY in black
    and white </strong> until the mark is final, THEN add color last. If you're new
    to logo design, you really have to trust me on this one. Really!\r\n\r\nOh, and
    for what it's worth, I never show a client ANYTHING I wouldn't put in my portfolio
    and bring to a job interview. You're the designer, not them, and if you show them
    ten designs, I can pretty much promise they'll pick the absolute worst one, then
    ... they'll ask you to make it bigger and add a glow. Then, you're stuck creating
    something you're ashamed of.\r\n\r\nFrankly, none of these designs would have
    ever left my computer. None of them come even close to the elegance and professionalism
    Mac buyers are drawn to - and trust. (This comment was typed on a 2009 Macbook
    Pro.)\r\n\r\nShow clients your best, even if they're a personal friend. If they
    hate it, you'll learn from their critique why and how to do better. Oh, and tell
    clients it's ok to hate it, because really it IS ok. A designer needs the truth
    to do their best work. I always insist clients don't coddle me. I'm not a tortured
    artist who'll cry if they don't buy my masterpiece, I'm a business partner.\r\n\r\n/end

  body: And I think Alaskan's point on Mac "elegance and professionalism" is a good
    starting point. Spend some time browsing the Apple site, product literature, etc.,
    and look at what sort of graphic elements they tend to use. What sort of qualities
    does that look represent or bring to mind? How can you use some of those elements
    or ideas to reflect those same qualities in the logo for this shop?

    ) \r\n\r\nAlaskan... Actually, the moment I show the client these options I regret
    it ... becoz now am stuck with#10... but I'll try to do something about that\r\n\r\nI
    think I'll have to try to come up with something with more \u201Celegance and
    professionalism\u201D... & it should be illegible\r\n\r\n\r\nThanx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
