    all the press it's gotten. ;o)

  body: Years ago, a friend of mine designed a logo for a large regional bank.  In
    the course of designing it, he mocked up a couple as a joke between himself and
    another designer, and set them aside. The presentation was moved up while he was
    on vacation (holiday), and a nitwit account executive dug around in his drawer,
    finding one of the joke designs, and presented it. The client chose it. When you
    looked at it sideways, it was clearly a masked robber. The design firm was sued
    after signs were made, stationery printed, etc.

  body: "I remember someone commenting that the new USA network logo looked like two
    guys, um, \"embracing\" a girl in between them. It took me a minute to see what
    they were talking about. It took me a minute with this one too. I think some people
    are more prone to noticing the sexual side than others. \r\n\r\nIt reminds me
    of a joke from the movie \"What About Bob.\" The Bob character played by Bill
    Murray is telling a joke in the cafeteria of a psychiatric hospital. It was something
    about a psychiatrist interviewing a patient and giving him a Rorschach ink blot
    test. For every ink blot the doctor holds up, the guy relates it to something
    sexual. The doctor finally gives up and tells the patient that he's obsessed with
    sex. The patient says \"but wait a minute doc, you're the one with all the dirty
    pictures.\""

    bold rounded sans is particularly suggestive.\r\nThank goodness the dieresis is

    to do with late-night German television."
