  product. Finally available here: http://www.typomaps.net\r\n\r\nThe Typomaps are
  awarded with the IF Design Award and are nominated for the Design- award of the
  Federal Republik of Germany 2011.\r\n\r\nThe Typomaps are handset, and not automatically
  generated by computer program. Thereby we achieved an astonishing closeness to the
  conventional worldmap. For the type-interessted people: we used the font \uFEFF\u201EHelvetica
  Neue Black Condensed\uFEFF\u201C."

    \u2013 it's admittedly a tough one to fit \u2013 but it makes me wonder, mightn't
    it have been interesting to use different widths (and maybe weights) of a given
    typeface*?\r\n(* And why oh why do people who make cool stuff with type so often
    fall back on this most nondescript of typefaces?)"

    really related to typography, but still an interesting take on the map!)"
