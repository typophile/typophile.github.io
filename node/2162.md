body: Hi, new here but have just spent about an hour and a half looking through loads
  of threads, some of the ideas here are amazing! <BR>Anyway, I&#39;m in the process
  of designing a portfolio site for myself to bring some of the work I&#39;ve done
  together to try to push for a new job. The site is called optonica &#40;does not
  mean anything, just like the word!&#41;. So far what I&#39;ve got I&#39;m not really
  happy with, I just think its a bit boring. I think the word optonica really lends
  itself to something special, it feels like a very &#39;designey&#39; word if you
  know what I mean.  <BR>So, below is what I got &#40;the bigger one is just to give
  you an idea of context and colours&#41;, please can I have some thoughts. Thanks
  in advance ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20958.gif"

  body: I&#39;m not in love with the black stroke its bulky. It has that techno, trendy
    eurostyle look that is boring now. Please look at this book &#34;Fresh Styles
    for web designers&#34; by curt cloninger, published by new riders. Try going back
    to pencil and paper and try to express your individual style. Break the mold!

    for the last couple of hours and this is the result: &#40;based on some of the
    chars Scott did in the &#39;Spunk&#39; thread. I&#39;m not really liking this
    one much though, just trying to get something going really. Thinking about a new
    domain now, like the word but cant seem to do alot with it!! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21134.gif"

  body: 'Mike: <BR> <BR>I think &#34;optonica&#34; is a great word. Especially if
    you&#39;re dealing with a lot of photography. I think the style of the type goes
    well with the title, but it does need more work &#40;BTW, I like the unicase &#34;A&#34;&#41;.
    The &#34;p&#34; looks a little large &#40;horizontal&#41; and the &#34;o&#34;s
    would be difficult to make out if I didn&#39;t know what the word was'

  body: the &#34;c-o&#34; combo is bothering me the most also... and i do find it
    rare when i like how this style of type is executed. <BR> <BR>if you go this route,
    i don&#39;t think you really need the left side of the &#34;o&#39;s&#34; as i&#39;ve
    shown. i&#39;ve also shortened the descender on the p.  <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21161.gif"

    between letters need some help. <BR> <BR>

  body: Mike what you need to make optonica work is a statement or phrase under it
    that explains it. As Scott said it works if you are dealing with alot of photography.
    It is currently in a vaccume when on its own.

    <BR>Daniel, I take you point about a tag line, its gonna be my portfolio site
    and &#40;sorry&#41; is not really anything to do with photos, just sites i&#39;ve
    done. Anyway, let me know what you all think, am i going in the right direction?

    nica - perhaps someone could suggest how to cheer up the nica &#40;err-hmm&#41;.

  body: 5{ry interesting. This last batch says photography more than before. It may
    just be exclusively my personal environment growing up &#40;70&#39;s&#41;, but
    these concepts with the horizontal lines specifically make me think of a mid-late
    70&#39;s photography/camera company. Don&#39;t ask me

  body: I like those new proposals, Mike, but I am afraid the sign &#40;OP I guess&#41;
    is too heavy for that very fragile font below it. No.3 makes me think - maybe
    you could put just a name Optonica as it is designed in that No.3 suggestion.
    Even more, the number 3 which you have put there just to mark the suggestion number
    actually works great with a word. Maybe you could rename your site into &#34;3optonica&#34;
    It could have a nice pronountiation. Or maybe you could replace 3 by something
    else keeping this kind of composition. <BR> <BR>In case you would like to continue
    development on OP sign, you should reconsider the position of P in that elipse.
    The relationship between the two elements works too disturbing for my eye. There
    must be something wrong with P&#39;s left upper corner and its relationship to
    the bypassing curve. Another disturbing section might be the end of the O curve
    under P&#39;s on the right side. For me the curve at this point gets too thick
    comparing to how much thinner it is at the top of the sign.

  body: 'Hi Dragnim, <BR> <BR>v. 1-10: I&#39;m seeing the Minolta effect myself, but
    it&#39;s not necessarily bothering me. The whole series does have kind of a &#39;70s
    roller rink feel to it, tho. 6-10, with the &#39;o&#39; connected to the &#39;t&#39;
    at the bottom, don&#39;t read. The &#39;ot&#39; ligature looks like a &#39;d&#39;.
    Also, the &#39;t&#39; seems way too tall on all of them. Of these, 3 is my favorite.
    The interior circles on the &#39;o&#39;s are producing some interesting closure,
    and they&#39;re light enough not to create blotches like they do when they&#39;re
    solid. <BR> <BR>On the last group I think you may be off on the wrong track. I&#39;m
    not sure why &#39;op&#39; should be emphasized--it doesn&#39;t serve as initials
    or anything. As well, it makes me think of the OP &#40;Ocean Pacific&#41; sportswear
    brand that was oh-so-hip in the U.S. in the mid-&#39;80s. Dunno if that brand
    made it over to the UK, tho, so you may not have to worry about that association.
    As well, that particular teal/green/whatever doesn&#39;t work for me with the
    greys. Too similar in value, not enough saturation. <BR> <BR>I think Matjaz may
    be on to something with his recommendation that you use just the &#39;optonica&#39;
    type from the last round. It has stark sort of feel to it that I&#39;m liking.
    <BR> <BR>As a general matter, given that you&#39;re using a made-up word you should
    probably try to keep the type fairly legible. With &#39;real&#39; words, you can
    sometimes get away with funkier character shapes because people already know what
    the character should be from context. <BR> <BR>'

  body: I&#39;m probably long overdue, but in your Nov 26 post you gave a bunch of
    iterations and some of the horizontal lines seemed to give a blur or haze. I&#39;m
    assuming this is intentional, but I think you can represent this by slightly blurring
    the left and right sides of the dot in the lc &#34;i&#34;. The screen resolution
    already makes the dot blurry, hence the idea.
