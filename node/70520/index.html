Book preservation pros recommend zeolite: place the offending article in a heavy-duty zip-lock bag with a couple tablespoons of the stuff, and change it out every three months or so. Less expensive and more readily available: kitty litter. Neither is a complete cure, but both definitely reduce the pungency.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Separately but related, I have started assembling the seeds of an idea for an online type specimen book and ephemera library via ebook or printed on-demand. It seems regrettable that all these great type books are hoarded up and cannot be shared, also they have no path to the future if they end up as estate sale winnings . . .

The origin of this thought was because of working with the Filmotype and Lettering Inc libraries with tons of amazing specimen books from the 1930s through 1960s many of which aren't likely to be reprinted again and I cringe flipping through the pages as they are fragile and I don't want to damage them further while being able to enjoy reading them . . .

Granted, I would admit copyright concern is a major priority but in most cases, many of the original companies and publishers no longer exist . . .

Any thoughts?

		<div class="commentbody">An online specimen library is definitely something we’re all going to need to work on. Between the growing numbers of type designers and the popularity of specimens with non-type designers (including people who should be hanged for cutting the books up to sell as prints!) these books are in very short supply. And the quality of Google Books scans is often abominable, making it useless for anything small. Maybe we should all get interns to scan everything and start uploading to Flickr. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've got volumes one and two of the German DVDs. Each DVD contains a collection of specimen books organized by country then by foundry. Within that structure, each specimen (books, pamphlets, cards, etc.) is a PDF made up from 150dpi scans (best guess). 

I think they are a wonderful survey of what was available in the world of metal type, good enough to get an idea what typefaces look like (for identification purposes for instance), and perhaps for judging whether or not you want to get hold of a certain physical specimen or not, or whether it's worth the asking price. I don't think the quality is good enough for doing tight digital revivals, but good enough to inspire and inform new faces.</div>

I think an online repository or even p.o.d. site for these would be a fantastic resource. The logisitics of it though - I have no idea. It's something that I'm sure many graphic designers as well as type designers would love to have access to.

Maybe even an informal flickr group would be great, as James mentioned. I've seen some stuff posted, but nothing too exhaustive. The craftsmanship and beauty of some of the pages is really impressive, and some of the pages are works of art.</div>

The 1912 ATF book is even larger. It's so heavy that my scanner tends to drag under the weight when I scan from the middle of the book.

BTW, I also have the first two volumes from Spatium: great stuff. Also available on eBay: a scanned CD of Barnhart Brothers & Spindler's Catalog #25, for $16.95 or so. Since I already have three copies of the book, I haven't checked out the CD...</div>

My first real design job was a summer internship at a corporation. Each afternoon we'd send our marked-up copy to the typesetter, and the next morning we'd receive our type galleys.

One morning the typesetter's delivery guy walked in and dropped an enormous envelope on my desk with a thud. "Here's your type." The package must have weighed 5 pounds. I stared at it in horror. Had I made some horrendous mistake when spec'ing type? Was I going to get fired?

With trembling hands I opened the package. My type was in there all right, but so was something I didn't expect -- the typesetter's massive new specimen book. Wheh.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the thoughtful input gang! I spoke with a tech buddy of mine and this isn't as difficult to do as we may think . . .

The problems are the problems . . .

Flickr only allows a max resolution and knowing what I know about this group, I don't think any of us would be satisfied without seeing the grains of the paper upon full zoom. OpenLibrary nor Flickr gave me this piece of mind . . .

The flip side of it is that nobody can print above 300 dpi, so at some point you hit diminishing returns on scans created for screen vs scans created for print . . . And as James mentioned, Google Books just ain't cuttin' it . . .

I guess the solution is something much closer to an OpenLibrary but even that isn't close enough . . .

I think there are multiple things that need to be solved:

* The POD problem since most of them only deal with fixed sizes and who can attest to quality?

* A host for 4-6mb images PER page at minimum

* An online reader

I presume perhaps naively that any contributors will do their own scanning and uploading and their own due diligence on legal issues pertaining to copyright . . .

Any thoughts on how to solve the rest of it?

POD could do some B&W specimens really well, but only if someone devoted a great deal of time to cleaning up all the images. I’m not a big fan.

<em>A host for 4-6mb images PER page at minimum</em>

Eek. We might need to just have a central repository for ordering DVDs.

<em>An online reader</em>

I think we would be better off just zipping everything up as CBZ files for use with comic-reading software. It’s much faster than trying to view big images through browsers or PDF readers.

<cite>I presume perhaps naively that any contributors will do their own scanning and uploading and their own due diligence on legal issues pertaining to copyright . . .</cite>

We could always just start with the public domain stuff and move forward from there. And we might also find that some of the people who have bought up the rights to old type libraries own the rights to the specimen books.

It might be worthwhile to try finding a private library where we could set up a camera stand and a server and work on something like this. Maybe the TDC library would be good given it’s proximity to some pretty exceptional collections of type specimens and other rare book.s</div>

I had the same problem with a copy of BB&S Catalog #9: small chips of paper moulted from the edges upon perusal. I chose simply to sever the spine with a guillotine paper cutter, and box the results...perhaps not a purist approach, but a lot neater in the end.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My son had a job at his university library for a while. The management's view of scanning books was that it was the answer to all their storage problems. (With permission) he'd brought home a number of old, leather-bound, musty smelling books and maps that, having been scanned, would otherwise have ended up in the recycling bin. 

My suggestion to scan, was not to replace a real book with a digital one, but to spare Chris' lungs from  mould spores and such, and  the book from constant handling.

		<div class="commentbody">In Germany, since some weeks we are working on a project to upload around 1,600 so called "Typokartei" DIN A5 (800 of it, two-sided). All scans are done already (300 dpi), each scan has around 180 KB. I guess this is close to maximum of what might be alright for the users of the website later on.

The cards show german lead letters from all german foundries, developed between 1910 and 1980 and in general they show all the same informations about the font - see pic below. We'll edit important informations about font name, foundry, year of first production, artist, DIN 16518 group/subgroup and more in a XML or ITCP format.

Yes, its a lot of work. Right now I start we renaming the pics, so font name is file name. fontware, a norwegian company out of prepress, specialists on archives and handling of large number of pictures, sponsored the project by giving us server and software.

I hope anywhere in three months or so, a visitor will have the chance to call a font on www.bleisetzer.de or he can select e.g. all fonts, first produced between 1920 and 1933. Or all fonts of Rudolf Koch or whatever.

this is great news! Thank you.

However, I wonder why you chose to save the scans as JPGs? The artefacts are horrible.

I disagree with this being the optimal quality, or the maximum acceptable file size. 
Today, 180 kb are not really a lot; for comparison, the homepage of SpOn often is ten times as ‘heavy’, with all its graphics etc.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Florian, I for myself need font alphabets to classify unknown lead letter fonts. Others might be interested to see text samples to get an idea about this "font in action".

But what, please, is a higher resolution good for?

Yes, I know what for. But just think about it. Would it not include a high risc of copyright probs? With a 300 dpi scan, its not senseful to try to digitize the scans. By the way: The printed quality of most of the old specimen (including the Typokartei one) is not as good as some of you may think. The lead letter CDs someone asked for, offers PDF files, where the pics were included before. So a question for quality depends on what you want to do with it? Both - our project scans and the ones from Hans Reichardts CDs are very nice tools for searching and studying fonts. But I do not see a must to offer it in a quality, able to produce reproductions. For my opinion.

		<div class="commentbody">From my perspective as a type designer and student of typography, no resolution can be too fine. I want to see every fibre of paper, because it is the effect of inked letter shapes on metal as it is pressed into paper that concerns me, and I want to see it exactly the way the type founders of the day saw it, because it is this degree of detail upon which they based the subtleties of their designs.

**

Resolution is not the only issue.
What should be the scanner's setting?
For different subject matter, contrast and brightness may be varied to optimize the image.
Then there is the somewhat postmodern question of whether a scan should represent the artefact as it is now, or be adjusted (i.e. "improved") to represent its original condition.

		<div class="commentbody">I want to add some comments on this.
I do believe that what is being spoken here is a digital library of Old Specimen Books.
There are lots of definition (and attempts) of what a digital library is.
For the Digital Library Federation:

"Digital libraries are organizations that provide the resources, including the specialized staff, to select, structure, offer intellectual access to, interpret, distribute, preserve the integrity of, and ensure the persistence over time of collections of digital works so that they are readily and economically available for use by a defined community or set of communities."

As we can agree, a digital library includes several layers.
The main layers are:
-providing the resources
-Organize them
-Distribute them
-Preserve the integrity of them
-Ensure the persistence over time of collections of digital works 

When I study this issues some years ago, we came up with a solution in using a Open-source software that was built in order to guaranty this all issues as they are of main concern when you developed a digital library. There are lots of software out there but this solution was fine for us: [[http://www.fedora-commons.org/about/examples|FEDORA ]] and [[http://fez.library.uq.edu.au/about/|FEZ ]] an interface for it.
These software working together can be what is need here. Lots of different users working together with the same application with several levels of permission (from user to administrator of collection responsible for checking who can add documents and validating them).

This software address some issues referred here by Nick Shinn: "as a type designer and student of typography, no resolution can be too fine" and "Then there is the somewhat post-modern question of whether a scan should represent the artefact as it is now, or be adjusted (i.e. "improved") to represent its original condition". I do agree with Nick "no resolution can be too fine and I want to see every fibre of paper, because it is the effect of inked letter shapes on metal as it is pressed into paper that concerns me". The software allows us to create this High-Res digitalisations and store them and develop all kind of disseminators(like a low-Res JPG or grayscale doc- everything you want).

Of course that the implementation of these software are not easy (not that difficult either- I'm no programmer and manage to install it) and a dedicated server. But in my opinion if the purpose here is to develop a real usable archive/digital library these matters have to be addressed.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi António,

I continue to study this matter deeply but haven't made much progress I'm afraid . . .

There are it seems two concerns . . .

1) Scanning/Offering the materials

2) Institutionalizing the materials

Insofar as issue one goes, I have some e-mails out to high end book scanning resources that won't destroy the book in the process of digitizing them . . . I will advise once I have heard some results . . .

As far as issue two goes, unless the originals are donated to an institution or provided to a large enough source whereby they can be hosted infinitely there is a fear that they will not survive archival storage if they are maintained at only one source . . .

I'm likely getting ahead of myself, but I think insofar as a digital copy goes, it can and should be scanned and shared and even a Print-on-demand solution would be desirable . . .

As far as the actual physical materials go, they should likely eventually end up in the hands of a library that can archive and store them for future generations rather end up at an estate sale marked for 5 cents each . . .

		<div class="commentbody">You could have the books re-bound, especially if they're falling apart as you said (I am a hobbyest binder, which is why I found this discussion). There are plenty of hand binders in every city. It doesn't really take an institution. One nice thing is when a book is completely disassembled it is much easier to scan. The only thing that really can't be fixed is very brittle paper. I'm always surprised how many people never consider rebinding books when they see what is actually just superficial damage. Sometimes it's just the cover that's damaged but the book doesn't even need to be re-sewn. If the edges look dingy, sometimes you can just trim the margins in a guillotine and the book looks almost new.

Another fun thing about rebinding is you can personalize the books imprinted with your initials or choose or color or so it matches your apartment. I've often taken a series of different books of similar sizes and made them look like a set.
