  report I'm working on. I've tried The Serif Extra Light and Serifa, but The Serif
  is too prickly and condensed and Serifa the x height is wrong. Does anybody have
  any other suggestions? FYI client is a power company \r\n\r\nThanks. C."

  body: I'm normally not a fan of Filosofia grand, but I've found it looks particularly
    nice next to DIN Engschift, especially in caps. Although, admittedly, Filosofia
    doesn't scream "power company."
