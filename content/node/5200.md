    makes me question Mason as well, as it bears a lot of similarities to Chalemange
    as well, doesn&#39;t it?&#41;. If I&#39;m inspired by a font I see, and I design
    a font that uses those characteristics, how is that theft? The laws in the US
    do not protect type design. They protect the software that allows one to use the
    font. It&#39;s not theft, it&#39;s a protected act that the patent office and
    copyright offices in the US have zero problem with.  <BR> <BR>I view this the

    and Charlemagne to see exactly where the thefts occurred. <BR> <BR>For the record,
    I didn&#39;t think Yves&#39; message was a personal attack -- it was an attack
    on the attitude of laughing &#40;that&#39;s what LOL means, Jose -- &#34;laughing
    out loud&#34;&#41; at the idea that after all the stealing, the end result was
    actually preferable, which connotes a kind of tacit acceptance of the theft. <BR>
    <BR>That&#39;s kind of why I&#39;d like to see the beziers -- it&#39;s one thing
    to steal an idea &#40;&#34;good artists borrow, great artists steal&#34;&#41;
    and improve on it; it&#39;s quite another to simply steal another&#39;s work,
    customize it a little and then call it your own. <BR> <BR>For example, Carol Twombly
    didn&#39;t come up with the ideas for Charlemagne &#40;or Trajan, for that matter&#41;
    out of thin air -- they&#39;re based on forms from history. She built on those
    ideas and created something both respectful of history and original at the same
    time. <BR> <BR>If the Parish designer printed out the Charlemagne and Mason sets,
    then traced them, added the Mason-inspired accents to the Charlemagne forms by
    drawing them on the paper, then scanned it in and did every bezier from scratch,
    then I wouldn&#39;t really have a problem with it. But if the designer simply
    converted Charlemagne and Mason to outlines, then modified the beziers, I&#39;d
    be much more upset about it. <BR> <BR>Finally, if it is an outright theft, as
    it looks like it is, it doesn&#39;t matter how hard the font is to find. The legal
    argument about international copyright is immaterial to me; it&#39;s a breach
    of professional ethics, especially to turn around and charge for the theft. '

    more reason to think that the accompanying font was legitimate.</i> <BR> <BR>Oops,
    I missed that, and I agree with you. <BR> <BR>If a designer likes a font, they
    will use it, and don&#39;t usually pay much attention to the pedigree. I don&#39;t
    really have a problem with that or even derivative fonts like Parish, in and of
    themselves. I do have a problem when someone tries to pass off such a font as
    an original work.  <BR> <BR>I do think derivative fonts should be allowed to exist
    somehow in a way that&#39;s fair to the original designers. There is certainly
    a demand for them. The one avenue that is allowed now in some licenses is that,
    if you have a legal copy of a font, you can make a derivative version for your
    own use. The problem is when you try to distribute it, which puts the maker of
    such a font in a very dubious and possibly illegal position. In an ideal world,
    Carol Twombly and Jonathan Barnbrook would get a cut of the proceeds from something
    like Parish. Or maybe there should be a requirement that, for example, anyone
    using Parish should have a legal copy of Charlemagne or Mason. In fact, there&#39;s
    no reason why people couldn&#39;t do this on their own now.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    a little sticky with Parish in particular, though. The basic font data seems to
    me to have come from Charlemagne. The designer then took ideas from Mason and
    applied them to Charlemagne. I think taking the basic font data from Charlemagne
    is very different taking visual ideas from Mason. The first is more to do with
    software copyright, the second is more about artistic integrity. Software can
    be protected legally. Ideas usually can&#39;t &#40;except by patent&#41;. I wonder

  body: Sorry, I have one last little thing and then I&#39;m done with the topic.
    The argument that the presence of Exocet seemed to imply legitimacy of the other
    font is spurious. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me, given the reality of the situation,
    if it turned out that the Exocet is not Exocet at all but is actually a similarly
    copied font.

  body: Oh, and for what it&#39;s worth, I opened both Parish and Charlemagne in FontLab.
    The point data of some of the characters in Parish is identical to Charlemagne.
    In some cases, there are the same number of points, but some of them have been
    moved around. In yet other cases, the characters have been redrawn.

    not &#34;spurious.&#34; My bad.

    ID request! I guess the question is, what ISN&#39;T stolen on there?

    I prefer to invest some time, love and  <BR>caring in an incredibly cute six-day
    old. If I may have  <BR>given the impression of bailing out in this discussion,  <BR>I
    sure hope you appreciate the reason why. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: As I said, my LOL&#39;ing was misunderstood as some sort of &#34;subconscious&#34;
    approval for theft &#40;there was probably a precedent for it, because I honestly
    don&#39;t know what gave yves that idea&#41; - but I won&#39;t hold that against
    ya guys ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Peace.

  body: 'At least as I understood it, your LOL remark indicated that you thought it
    was funny &#40;likely in the ironic rather than the ha-ha sense&#41; that even
    after you knew the font was a bastardized version of two established typefaces,
    you still liked it better. You have every right to like it better -- I&#39;m sure
    the designer did, too; it was his idea to &#34;improve&#34; upon Charlemagne and
    Mason in the first place. The problem &#40;for me, anyway; not trying to speak
    for Yves but I did it so well before...&#41; is that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s
    anything funny about how he apparently went about it, ironic, ha-ha, or otherwise.
    <BR> <BR>Note: neither I nor Yves suggested that you approved of the practice,
    but if you end up using the font, you&#39;ve basically accepted it as a convenience
    with reservations. Two very different things.'
