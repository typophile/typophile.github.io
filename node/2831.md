body: This is a logo I&#39;ve designed for my own freelance graphic design/illustration
  work. My concept is that I&#39;m comparing myself to a Ronin, Japanese for a samurai
  without a master, working for hire, in that I work for myself, for hire. I wanted
  to convey a clean, stylish, modern look with a bit of a Japanese/Asian feel.  <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m mainly using the top version, however I made the bottom two in case
  I wanted to use a more compact, less horizontal version of the logo. How do you
  feel about multiple versions of logos? Is this ok, or is it something that&#39;s
  frowned upon? I&#39;d appreciate your feedback.  Thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/24821.gif"

  body: I would use the bottom right one, it has more pregnancy and looks more japanese.

    for a thing with a Japanese name is kind of clich

  body: Chris may I ask you where you are working. The concept will go over peoples
    heads unless you are just dealing with an Asian market. I agree with Aleph about
    using a symbol. Your logo feels forced to me.

  body: Thanks for the comments.  Personally, I think only the capital R and G have
    a slight asian feel.  My intent was not to make it overtly japanese/asian, but
    to give it just that little touch to reflect the name as well as to represent
    my personal tastes &#40;being a fan of asian aesthetics, both traditional and
    modern&#41;.  <BR> <BR>As far as the concept going over people&#39;s heads...it
    wasn&#39;t that important to me that people be immediately familiar with the term
    &#34;ronin&#34;, however, I plan to incorporate the definition and its relation
    to me, in things such as the mission statement/website/etc.  I like the name because
    it gets people asking about its meaning. <BR> <BR>Also, how do people feel about
    using variations on a logo...or is it a strict policy of choosing one and sticking
    with it?

  body: I think many people know that Ronin is a Japanese term, although few will
    know it&#39;s exact meaning &#40;but that&#39;s OK&#41;. And I think Chris has
    struck a very nice balance between cliche and too-subtle. Those letters are not
    the rancid &#34;chop suey&#34; style, but they look nicely comptemporary-Japanese.
    A little frivolous though. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The most important thing to communicate with your identity the attitude that
    you take with your design. If you have many methods of working through a design
    or work with many styles several logos might suit you better than one.  <BR> <BR>Overall
    I would say that is is more important that the attitude you convey be consistent
    than the particular logo you use.  <BR> <BR>This is especially true if you market
    yourself in a personalised, direct fashion than if you just pepper the local papers
    with adverts.

  body: I prefer the top and the lower-right ones, although I agree with Aleph about
    your technique. This was a huge trend that came and went, so you may be creating
    associations you don&#39;t want. It&#39;s a bit more subtle than <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cs-takahashi/">CS
    Takahashi</a>, but that&#39;s the first association my mind makes, along with
    the Playstation game series <a href="http://www.kleber.net/wipeout3/history/2097/">Wipeout</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Although, looking at <a href="http://www.ronin-graphics.com/">your work</a>,
    I see that you tend towards lush, fast, young graphics anyway, so these associations
    could work in your favor. I recommend being more consistent with your use of the
    one-line logotype on your site. Personally, I&#39;d replace the Ronin Graphics
    header that follows the splash page, which looks bland next to your personalized
    version. <BR> <BR>By they way, <i>Hellboy</i> rules.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Chris, this posting reinforces my belief that few will get the reference to
    Ronin. You are asking John Q Public to be aware of the meaning. As for weather
    you can use the symbol in different ways the answer is of course you can. Different
    media, require the flexibility for change. A business card is a different environment
    than a web page. But, make sure you use it consistantly in the media of choice.
    If you stack it for a business card, always stack it for a business card. Just
    some thoughts
