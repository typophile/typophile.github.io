  show up in my profile?\r\n\r\nAnyway, original artwork done by a signmaker who passed
  away.\r\nThe business asked me to recreate the logo.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on these two
  fonts? The script is similar to Brewmeister.\r\nBarbador was the closest I came
  to the \"Bar & Grill\" line.\r\n\r\nDo you think hand drawn?"

  body: "This is the same request you posted in http://typophile.com/node/117300 but
    with a larger picture and a second font suggestion.\r\nIn my opinion this is hand
    lettering rather than fonts as such.\r\nI have not been able to get any closer
    than Font Mesa's Brewmaster [Your \"Brewmeister\"?] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/brewmaster/
    and note that it was based on an old Budweiser logo. \r\nThis type of script was
    popular in the decades around 1900. We sometimes lump them together as \"Baseball\"
    scripts. See for example Fenway Park JF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/fenway-park-jf/
    Philly Sport Script is close http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/philly-sport-script/
    except for the J.\r\nAnother possible alternative is Arizona http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/arizonia/\r\nFor
    this type of business a script based on an old Miller beer logo, like Font Mesa's
    Draft Beer http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/draft-beer-classic/ might be
    adaptable.\r\nAs for \"Barbador\" I am not certain as to which font this is.\r\nDon\r\n"

    \ I saw Fenway in my search and saw that it was similar... I will check the others.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I did mean Brew Master.  Thanks, again."

    do the letters from scratch or edit a heavy flare-serif like Clearface Gothic
