  book, and I'd like some critique on the page layout.&ensp;Primarily, I want to be
  sure I've not done anything typographically s<em>t</em>oopid.\r\n\u2022&ensp;Is
  6\u2033\xD79\u2033 a convenient size for a book, or would folks recommend a different
  trim?\r\n\u2022&ensp;To split sections: an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography)|asterism
  (\u2042)]], something custom (<em>e.g.</em>, ~\u2021~), a blank line, or what?\r\n\u2022&ensp;I'm
  using Gentium Book (at 10/12) for the main body text, but in one chapter I need
  to make a distinction between \"present\", \"recent past\" (where most of the action
  takes place), and flashbacks.&ensp;I'm including two paragraphs in Fontin (9.5/12).&ensp;The
  color seems to match; too well, perhaps\u2014is the distinction easily visible?&ensp;How
  else to differentiate the \"voices\"?\r\n<!--break-->\u2022&ensp;The Chinese headings
  are there because of the large role the Chinese language and culture have in the
  <em>Firefly</em> universe (the \"'verse\").&ensp;Is my current placement effective
  there?&ensp;Would people recommend a different font than the MS MingLiU I've used&mdash;a
  more calligraphic style, perhaps?\r\n&emsp;Thanks,\r\n&mdash;Joel\r\n"

    wonder about the inside margin when the book is bound\u2014might close in a too

  body: "Firefly is great. Sounds like a fun book.\r\n\r\nJust some quick comments:\r\n\r\nThe
    section separator needs more space above and below it.\r\n\r\nHang your punctuation.\r\n\r\nI'd
    maybe consider rag-right. I'm see some rather large gaps on a lot of your lines.
    Either that or perhaps try turning on hyphenation.\r\n\r\nI like the integration
    of the chinese characters.\r\n\r\nI'd small-cap the entire first line.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    the firefly logo on the bottom of every page seems a bit heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "[For some strange reason this post got re-ordered in the thread when I edited
    it...]\r\n\r\n<ol><li>As above, turn on hyphenation, or at the very least fine-tune
    your justification settings; the word-gaps (especially in the third section of
    page 2) are awful.</li>\r\n<li>While I find far too many books slaughter their
    margins and ignore proper proportions, I'd be surprised if your client doesn't
    kill you for all that wasted space (and paper) at the outer edge and bottom; this
    is, after all, not a 15th century codex -- also, as above, open up your spine
    margin a bit or it will get swallowed.</li>\r\n<li>I'd give more bottom air to
    your chapter heading and chapter title (that is, put some space between the chapter
    title and the small-cap intro-line).</li>\r\n<li>If the Chinese characters only
    appear on chapter openings (recto pages), I'd hang them outside the text block
    in that very generous margin.</li>\r\n<li>Letterspace your small-cap strings (the
    intro lines, but also everywhere you use small caps).</li>\r\n<li>The x-height
    is too drastically different from the first to the second fonts on page 1.</li>\r\n<li>(This

  body: "Glad these bits & pieces are useful; a few more...\r\n\r\n<ol><li>Sounds
    good.</li>\r\n<li>To take a step backwards, 6\u2033\xD79\u2033 is a gangly page,
    too wide for its height, but it's also one of the two most standard formats in
    North American printing, so in terms of economics it's what most publishers would
    push for. However, as you're your own client, I'd knock the width down to 5.75\u2033.
    From there, use the Van de Graaf formula to establish your text block, then move
    it towards the outer edge to allow for creep, then nudge your outer and bottom
    margins to find a balance between classical proportions and contemporary norms.
    I use no set formula for this, but, depending on type-size/leading/etc., paper,
    and, of course, the subject matter of the book itself, I try a variety of measurements
    until the page is right. Hanging matter (such as if you were to hang the Chinese
    characters) will also play a role in determining your margins, but generally it's
    just about finding the right contrast of text-block to white-space, and at the
    moment, although based on classical proportions, your page looks out of whack.</li>\r\n<li>I'm
    backtracking, sort of, but I'd either drop the first paragraph more, or less;
    at the moment the chapter headings are feeling a bit uncertain.</li>\r\n<li>More
    than just \"using\" the margin, I found the earlier setting awkward in the way
    the body copy wrapped around the Chinese characters. Try dropping the Chinese
    string down so that it begins at the same x-height as the first line of body text.</li>\r\n<li>It's
    better now with the first font; the second font still needs a bit more tracking.</li>\r\n<li>You're
    right, the color is a bit off, but the sizing looks much better. Maybe nudge the
    second font up just slightly in size to draw out the color, or, scrap the second
    font and find another with a better x-height match.</li></ol>"
