  body: "This graphic is all about what people will do to be free (-ish), when confronted
    by an imposing force. \r\n \r\nThe brown thing is a tunnel. The word TrutH graphically
    represents a barrier a wall a border..., which is strong enough to force someones
    will but not strong enough to conquer someones will. TrutH is in black, because
    it is a dark truth. And all the elements of the graphic are composed upwards to
    force the viewer under the word TrutH.\r\n \r\nWhen a dark truth imposes its will,
    some people go 'underground' - most just acquiesce. In this graphic the 'underground'
    is of warm natural colours browns and yellow, with the other elements achromatic.
    The letters T and H are depicted to drive deep down from the surface. This represents
    the amount/effort of force. And yet, that force is still overcome by the will.
    \r\n \r\nIt is meant to be unsettling. The only elements which have a nice constant
    fluidity are the browns - of the tunnel - and the yellow of the 'underground'.\r\n
    \r\nThere are other subtext in this graphic too. For instance the letters 'rut'
    found in the word TrutH are emphasised to illustrate the entrenchment of our narrrow
    opinions and of conceitment - we lose perspective of the real qualities which
    make us all great - and we get into a bad groove - a.k.a. a rut."
