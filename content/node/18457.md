body: "Hello all... first post here.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 months ago, when I was absent
  from work for a few months due to an illness, my organisation's management decided
  to undertake a rebranding without involving the inhouse designers.\r\n\r\nSo upon
  my return, I discovered that we've ended up with a virtually unusable logo and a
  corporate family that is completely unsuitable for setting lengthy documents like
  reports and publications.\r\n\r\nI can't ditch the family chosen for display type
  but I do have the option to choose a serif face to accompany it.\r\n\r\nSo I wondered
  if anyone would like to suggest directions to start in to help narrow down the choices?
  I guess the aim is to go for something with a contemporary feel \u2014 maybe with
  a generous x-height, extremely legible (for diversity purposes) and can tolerate
  tight fitting if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe typeface \u2014 which I'm not particularly
  fond of \u2014 that the serif face has to accompany is a humanist sans with a peculiar
  ampersand: Today SB\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/today-sans-sb/\r\n\r\nThe
  external design agency that foisted this upon us only recommended the Light and
  Medium variant, which is far too inflexible. First thing on Monday, I will also
  be purchasing the Regular set as well...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to all advice."

  body: "Thanks Tim.\r\n\r\nI especially like the look of Dolly after downloading
    a sample PDF from the foundry's website and found an article about it here as
    well.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/21831.html\r\n\r\nI've put
    together some sample sheets of a couple of the others and will run them out in
    the office next week with some heads and subs in Today SB.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else
    has any suggestions, then they'd be most welcome."

  body: "I have another question though for anyone who can offer advice or help.\r\n\r\nHow
    could I go about getting a sample sheet of Cicero?\r\n\r\nI can't see any facility
    from Monotype to request a PDF, which is most irritating. I can't consider purchasing
    a multi-licensed typeface on the basis of a screenshot alone... I can't even seem
    to find a UK supplier that I can call. Our usual vendor (fontshop.co.uk) isn't
    licensed to handle this face...\r\n\r\nI just need a 12 or more line setting of
    10/12 over a 24-30 pica (approx 10-13cm) measure with some words picked out in
    the variants so I can get a feel for it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone who
    can help with this."

    Delicato or Anziano as an option.\r\n\r\nHave a look yourself at; http://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nI'll
    be willing to help you out with pdf files if needed."

      look at them at the office sometime this week along with all the others...\r\n\r\n...except
      for Cicero which I just cannot find anywhere. Grrr."
