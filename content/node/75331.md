body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sanglier-typo-test_4458.jpg]\r\nI'm working
  on this project intermittently since some months. It is based on a blackletter but
  y try to construct each letter with some geometrical shape, giving it a more contemporary
  aspect. My first idea was a whole family for an edition project in wich each music
  style (it was about music festivals) was accompagnied by its own type variation.
  Something like Peter Bil'ak's \"History\" project \u2014 in all humility! \u2013.\r\nThe
  structure stay the same (generally the vertical strokes), but terminals and bowls
  change. This was a first sketch for it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/variantes-lettres_3725.jpg]"

    I especially love the lowercase. Added to <a href="http://welovetypography.com/">WLT</a>.
