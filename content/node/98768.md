  are synonymous, or whether there are differences between the two, and if so what
  would those differences be?\r\n\r\nAlso, in mathematical typesetting where fraktur
  letters are called for, would it be acceptable to substitute a b\xE2tarde (specifically,
  Duc de Berry)?\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Schwabacher and B\xE2tarde are fairly closely related, within the larger
    category of blackletter, but are distinct enough to exist as separate sub-categories.
    This is especially true in manuscript, in which B\xE2tarde styles tend towards
    greater informality and faster writing. In type, the similarities may be more
    obvious, as the B\xE2tarde will tend to be formalised. To get a feel for the differences,
    I recommend doing Google image searches on the two terms.\r\n\r\nConventionally,
    use of blackletter in mathematics had tended to be a fairly light form of fraktur.
    A B\xE2tarde along the lines of the Duc de Berry type would be appropriate weight,
    but I couldn't say whether the letterforms would be readily accepted by mathematicians.
    Remember, in the context of mathematics, these characters are being used a symbols,
    not as regular text, so it is important that they correspond sufficiently to expectations."

    alongside a bottle of ink to their lectures, they often use [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin|S\xFCtterlin]]
    to reproduce fraktur denotations."
