Looking at other historical &quot;letterpress&quot; models you will find that to be true.

Caslon would still be cutting. That method would require many strikes, broken punches and a typeface inferior to the great type face he produced. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Progressive proofs are essential.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; It doesn't necessarily follow that Caslon was allowing for gain. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What other reason would there be to implement trapping? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But anyway, trapping is not the primary factor - increase in weight is. Do you think Caslon didn't care about that? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; When specifically did trapping begin to be implemented? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good question - I'd be very interested to find out. The problem of course is that the further back you go the less chance you'll have the punches at hand to see the traps: they don't show up from the actual prints* (they're not supposed to). And procuring smoke proofs of old fonts is probably next to impossible. Who would have kept them? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Actually, there might be a way, by very carefully the rounding of outside versus inside corners&hellip; I'll have to figure that out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My guess is that they started implementing trapping as soon as they -and society- got comfortable with printing as a technology, and could worry about the finer things. So maybe early in the 16th century? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I suspect concerns for the &quot;reader&quot; or &quot;reading&quot; are much later in terms of typographic consideration. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In terms of cultural trends, I have to trust you time-framing of this, since I know little about it.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, Caslon and just about anyone else working prior to the nineteenth century. Not many examples of emboldened typefaces previous to the Industrial Revolution are there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moxon's book of 1683 does not discuss trapping or any similar concerns in regard to punchcutting. Printing is an industrial practice. There certainly was a craft concern in the beginning of printing's history but this begins to erode once the ad hoc nature of printing enterprise disappears and it becomes regulated and specialized through guild practices. In terms of printing being an Art, these rarified discussions begin in the late nineteenth century. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't believe you can apply the concept of readership or concern for the reader to late medieval/early Renaissance work but that is exactly what was done with the Revival(s), as a natural rationale. Something else WAS very much at play way back when, but it was not a consideration for the &quot;reader.&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Gerald (Lange) is ambivalent about all this. He knows orders of magnitude more about metal type than I do, and has a practical, even pragmatic outlook that's highly valuable, but I will note that once or twice I've pointed out traps in metal fonts that he hadn't noticed were there. Without the benefit of zooming in on a digital outline until it fills your screen, you really have to be looking for the stuff to see it. Sometimes you even need a loupe. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; scepticism about your ink trapping theory. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory? It's more of a belief: that a good text face has some. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know how many people (in the past and today) put trapping in their designs, but that's really secondary. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; &quot;a separation marker&quot; dividing art from craft. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is no strict separation - nothing exists in a pure state. But Art is about self-expression, while Craft is about serving other people. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I will tell you how I know Caslon did not implement &quot;ink trapping&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; enviable historical elevation <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Like I said above, I have little grasp of how narrowly/widely trapping was used, especially not so far in the past, so I can't take credit for any kind of deep practical insight. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) It's no secret that trapping was used way before the advent of phototype technology. It's just that people these days* don't think about it much, probably not least because digital type can be used much larger than its &quot;intended&quot; size, and traps can look ugly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I shouldn't say that. Since more than a year now there seems to be a lot more interest. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; This negated religious adherence to drawings which may not have even existed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, I can see how a lack of &quot;peer pressure&quot; back then caused Caslon not to care so much for consistency (culture is a huge guide - most design decisions in any age are based on what other people are doing), but if you believe that a font has a certain character, and certain types of consistency at least strengthen this character and make the design more focused/useful, then you don't vary things so much. Caslon is known for his wanton variance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; You say Caslon's scaling is not linear, it could have been. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure what you mean. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I called his UC italic &quot;Q&quot; non-linear I was perhaps using the term badly. I meant that the way that internal curl becomes less convolved in the smaller sizes cannot be interpolated along Cartesian axes - it's a polar thing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; do you see any evidence of ink trapping in the bowl of the smallest of the Q exemplars? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at Founders Caslon, which is based on prints, and trying to visualize how the designed shape looked like before it suffered gain, I'd have to say there's probably no trapping there - but that's not a reliable opinion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm guessing but I kind of doubt you will find evidence of trapping, as a theoretical design device, prior to the twentieth century. Given certain technological and cultural structures, I don't seen any reason for it to have existed prior.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some tricks, such as the use of the same counter punch for different sizes (punched deeper and thus wider) might have some optical consideration and some ranging consequences (the bowl of the Q).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, Justin Howes told me once there was a notable mid-nineteenth attempt to NOT provide scaling but an exact replication through the size line, so some thought was in place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps the key though is in Gerald's remark about the naming of sizes, which I had previously not considered (I like this). The point system is turn-of-the century in implementation.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple of observations. First, I think the concept of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a linear progression between type sizes is a twentieth-  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->century ideal. As both Geralds mentioned, prior to the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->adoption of the point system, individual names were  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->used for type sizes &ndash; you know this. Many of these  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->names were commonly used, though the actual  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->measures would vary. (This is what the point system  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sought to overcome.) But sometimes, I think, a new  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->name might be made up for a new font. I think Granjon  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was fond of this.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This suggests to me that these typefounders approached  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->each font as a new design, not necessarily a variation  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on an existing alphabet. Certainly there are remarkable  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->consistencies between fonts from the same hand, to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the degree that a punchcutter held a fixed ideal in his  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->head about the shapes of letters. But I doubt that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Garamond, for instance, had in his head that he was  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->creating the 24-point version of the &quot;Garamond&quot; typeface  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design. Caslon wasn't setting out to make the 36-point  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->version of &quot;Caslon.&quot; I doubt Caslon, the man, had the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->concept of Caslon, the typeface, which we have now.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These men simply set out to make an alphabet of a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->particular size because it was needed. There was no  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->imperative for it to look necessarily like an enlargement  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of what went before, certainly not a linear one. The  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->concept of related type styles in one family did not  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->emerge until Morris Fuller Benton's work unifying the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ATF library. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Secondly, you must keep in mind that there was no  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->term for (and perhaps no concept of) &quot;ink trap&quot; prior  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to the 20th century. And, in fact, we are using the term  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here in almost the opposite sense of its original coinage.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The term &quot;ink trap&quot; was originated in 1930 by the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->printer Henry A. Wise Wood. He used it to describe  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->areas of a letterform which, due to the circumstances  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of the increasing acceleration of high-speed presses,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would fill up with ink. He thought that types could be  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->improved by eliminating these &quot;ink traps&quot; from the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design. Linotype's first approach to the problem was to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vary the structure of the letter design to eliminate these  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->problem areas &ndash; this was the aim of the Legibility Series  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of newspaper types. Later approaches involved the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->introduction of nicks or notches to allow the collected  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ink to trap in controlled ways and preserve the desired  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->outline &ndash; Bell Gothic being the most notable example.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is only recently that we've co-opted the term to refer  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to the nicks themselves and not the problem that they  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->were trying to compensate for. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All this by way of suggesting that punchcutters did not  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have a term, and perhaps not even a concept (or even  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a need), for this kind of compensation and you might be  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hard-pressed to find any examples.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I kind of doubt you will find evidence of trapping, as a theoretical design device, prior to the twentieth century. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think I've actually seen some very early examples (like in an UC &quot;R&quot; from Le Be II), but I admit I can't be sure. It would be a major project to track this stuff down. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Stanley Morrison <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Morrison was a ideologue, and he simply leveraged that to further his company's interests. His only use for legibility studies is if they helped promote his own pre-determined (highly traditionalist) stance. Any technical sensibility was only useful to him if it proved one of his points - note how he sidelined the much more knowledgable Pierpont, and like how he made a big deal about Cyril Burt's study (which turned out to be a sham). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monotype -being a corporation- was mostly about making money efficiently. Trapping being of obscure benefit* would have slowed them down. On the other hand, I'm not sure they didn't do it! Clearly, I have a lot of research work to conduct before I can have an opinion on that. Traps are sometimes tiny (I'll try to show an example soon), and you really do need to look very closely, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at printed sample (see below). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* In fact, it's not even easy for me to justify it in terms of pure functionality. To me it's more a matter of preserving the design intent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; mistaken &quot;ink trapping&quot; for &quot;light trapping&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Same difference - just a matter of polarity and quantity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; &quot;ink trapping&quot; as spoken is a noticable abberations in design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are you saying people implement trapping by mistake? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; If it is not in the type, they are not in the punches either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only if the printing is perfectly gain-free, which is extremely rare. In practice, the entire point of trapping is for the end-result not to reveal it! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; These men simply set out to make an alphabet of a particular size because it was needed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, that's certainly true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; there was no term for (and perhaps no concept of) &quot;ink trap&quot; prior to the 20th century. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe because things were insular and poorly documented back then? It's not like when Kis was apprenticed to Voskens he took notes and published them! Trapping is a technical thing that wouldn't have been publicized. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, I'm not insisting they're a very old device - I need to delve much deeper. But I do remember John Downer mentioning (on the TD list*) that old punchcutters would have a small hard needle type thing they'd drive into tight corners, to (eventually) trap the ink, and I think I've spotted examples. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* From about 2.5 years ago: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The so-called 'Trapping Flower' proposed, does have an advantage that the use of a tiny, calibrated, ball bearing &ndash; as used to determine need for how to proceed with deepening a crotch &ndash; doesn't have: it's digital. You don't need to be skilled with forceps or a graver to insert a tangent point and pull out BCPs. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A 'BB' (the little copper shot used in a BB gun) tells &ndash; it likewise will give the precise placement &amp; width of the mouth of a symmetrical (but only a symmetrical) trap. Still, the Papazian version of the 'BB Method' invented by punchcutters has little use outside the scenario illustrated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, documentation on punchcutting, at the theoretical level you are looking for, is fugitive but there are some bits here and there. Not enough to put something together with though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But that little device of Downer's is a subsurface tool that would not show up on the face. This is for ink drain, providing a sharper inclination of slope at corners. Even Monotype castings will readily reveal this. Similar to a trap I suspect in function, but not applicable to digital obviously. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've wondered about the Trapping Flower's shape. Sounds like a possible solution if it could be scripted in some rationale fashion but would the rounded BB be the best solution? Deep traps seem to be cut with two angles to allow the ink to form its own curve? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The latter is also the technique implemented by Adobe as indicated in its [extreme series] monograph on trapping (trapping in regard to color application). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
