		<div class="commentbody"><p>This comes up quite often as a newbie question, and the answer can be found in a style guide for whatever country you live in. U.S. and Canadian style is to place periods and commas inside quotation marks always (double first, single for quotes inside quotes). There are highly unusual exceptions, as in computer code and linguistics, that will surely never affect you.</p>
<p>The dominant but not sole U.K. style is to place periods and commas inside quotes only if the quote is an actual human utterance. (So no androids!) Otherwise outside. Single-double, not double-single, is the dominant usage.</p>
<p>Other countries can barely get their acts together in the first place, and I don’t know what system they use.</p>

<p>My question arise since I found this old post regarding Erik Spiekermann typo tips (hidden under a lot of rss)
<a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/erik-spiekermanns-typo-tips/">http://fontfeed.com/archives/erik-spiekermanns-typo-tips/</a></p>
<p>He explains that the quotes style he use is an European style, it is found on the first comment after the article.</p>
<p>It is. But I take issue with the American style: I always put
the period or comma where the context needs it. If the quote
has a point after it, like a complete sentence, it’s included
in the quote:</p>
<pre><code>  Groucho Marx said, “I wouldn’t join a club that accepted me as a member.”
</code></pre>
<p>(Now, there should logically be a second full point to finish
the sentence around the quote, but in German, we neglect that.) But:</p>
<pre><code>  He always got gas at the “76”.
</code></pre>
<p>Putting them inside the closing quote is an aesthetic decision,
not a grammatical one, but it is American usage.</p>

<p>Very sensible. That is the thinking behind the UK convention, and it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to think about it this way: if an entire sentence is a quotation, then all the punctuation of that sentence, including the terminal fullstop, is part of that quotation and hence the fullstop belongs within the quote marks. If a quotation is only part of a sentence, then the terminal full stop belongs to the sentence as a whole and not to the quote, and hence the fullstop belongs outside the quote marks.</p>
<p>Most Canadian practice seems to follow the US model, which I consider arbitrary and without grammatical logic. But I&rsquo;m enough of a colonialist to maintain that any UK practice is legitimate in this dominion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joe, there are countries whose governments take a fairly direct interest in things like spelling, about which it might be accurate to say that they have prescriptive national &lsquo;rules&rsquo; about such things. It is notable, though, that even within such countries individual publishers, some of them significant and influential, ignore those rules. Recent German spelling reforms are not universally implemented. Some Greek publishers continue to use polytonic despite the monotonic system having been the official rule since 1982.</p>
<p>There are not, in fact, national rules. There are widely observed conventions and there are also variations. There are indeed rules for e.g. government publications, but in that respect the government is just one more publisher, and other publishers may employ variant rules in their own house styles.</p>
<p>I long ago determined that the prevailing British conventions for punctuation made more grammatical sense and looked better on the page. So that is what I use. This isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ignorance&rsquo;: I know what other conventions are common in Canada. I disagree with them, and I&rsquo;m not generally in favour of doing what other people do just because they are doing it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with John. When typesetting German, whenever I&rsquo;m given the liberty by the editor, I employ pre-spelling reform rules rather than the current &ldquo;correct&rdquo; ones – they simply make more sense grammatically, and in terms of what people are still used to reading. – Different example: in German it is a rule not to set ligatures across word breaks in compounds; but I still do that with certain fonts, depending on the actual design of the ligature, and it works just fine.
I believe that knowing the rules and abandoning them in some occasions and for good reasons does not constitute the same crime as ignoring them and just doing whatever. Slavishly adhering to rules without questioning their sense and benefit is much worse IMHO.</div>

Smarty Pants, used here on Typophile, is one of the exceptions in converting an opening quotesingle into an apostrophe (quoteright). This works great for abbreviating years, such as &lsquo;09, but not so wonderful for quoting with single marks, as in your example.</div>

<p>What I meant was that although the single quote style works OK for quote marks , it&rsquo;s incompatibility is that it screws up abbreviation marks.  But if this problem is solved, as Smarty Pants has, then the single-quote style of quote marks doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>As the Smarty Pants system is the only way of converting hash marks to curly quotes (short of adding a dictionary) and not rotating the apostrophes used in abbreviations, and it works with the North American quote style, rather than the UK, it is arguable whether the merits of the UK quote style are sufficient to warrant the extinction of the &ldquo;single-quote-right&rdquo; shape of apostrophe, which will probably occur as a result of &ldquo;curly quote&rdquo; layout software.</p>

<p>But then how do the rules apply for guillemets in English? When are the singles and doubles used, which direction should they point on opening and closing, and how are they positioned relative to punctuation? Except for the benefit of not being confused with apostrophes and other similar marks, guillemets present the same challenges as the more familiar (to most English writers) quotation marks. Are not the languages that use guillemets inconsistent with their application from one to another as well?</p>

Yup. French has them pointing outwards and adds spaces on the inside, German has them pointing inwards with no spaces and Switzerland has a mixture of the two (pointing outwards with no spaces).
I guess the good news about this is that all those variants work, and are recognized as what they are. When Swiss people read German text, I don&rsquo;t think they believe the inwards-pointing guillemets are &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jason, I think people will take a few seconds and then know exactly what they&rsquo;re looking at when they see guillemets for the first time in English*, and after that they&rsquo;ll go with the flow. I would point them outward, but not use single guillemets; for nested quoting I would fall back on double high quotes (which is what French does I believe). This is in fact also an improvement: resorting to nested high quotes (either double-then-single or vice versa) is even more confusing. For the two important drawbacks that high quotes suffer from, guillemets are superior; and I don&rsquo;t see any drawbacks (after the initial surprise).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joe, where are these rules written down, and under what authority? Where does a newcomer to Canadian punctuation conventions go if he wants to learn the correct way to do things?</p>
<p>In what sense are publishers who use alternative conventions, such as British conventions, ‘safely ignored’? They presumably publish books, and presumably people buy and read these books. And since they&rsquo;re Canadian publishers, odds are that at least some of them receive government grants, despite their punctuation. They might not have any influence over how other Canadians use punctuation, but I&rsquo;m not saying that they should have any influence. I do think, however, that variance in punctuation use, so long as the meaning of the text is unambiguous &ndash; which is not the case, by the way, when punctuation is always placed within the quote marks regardless of whether it was part of the quote utterance &ndash; is an acceptable cultural phenomenon, especially in a country that prides itself on its diversity.</p>

<p>Fair enough. Where we disagree, I think, is that contravening these rules automatically signals either ignorance or incompetence. I think there are solid grammatical reasons why British punctuation is superior to Canadian and American punctuation: it provides more accurate information about the structure of the text by indicating visually whether punctuation is part of the quote or part of an external sentence in which the quote is embedded.</p>

<p>It’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->easy to find counterexamples<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the claimed superiority of British house style, since English words can begin or end with an apostrophe, which is one of the two punctuation marks used for first-level quotations in British.</p>

<p>Actually I should know better than to offer such a qualification, because
It&rsquo;s Not So Simple™. There is no purity - no way to decide all the time for
everybody if a mark on the paper is one symbol or the other; in some cases
the ambiguity is great enough that some threshold is crossed. Specifically I
offer that favorite &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; of mine from that other thread - something I&rsquo;ve
called &ldquo;quotemets&rdquo;:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quotemets_6067.gif]</p>
<p>So are those quotes, or guillemets? They look like quotes (although
they&rsquo;re mirrored, not 6/9) except they&rsquo;re not high enough&hellip; They
look like guillemets, except for those knobs&hellip; Typographically they
can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo;, but can they even be grammatically &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo;
if you can&rsquo;t convince enough people they&rsquo;re not really quotes (if it
was English text) or guillemets (for that French text)?</p>
<p>Very often, even if you have adopted strict rules and want very
much to follow them, you can&rsquo;t, because it escapes your realm.</p>
