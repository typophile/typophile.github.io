  body: "For what it's worth, I checked over 500 serif font families with round/ball
    terminals, and found very few with an 'a' that was even similar, with this odd
    curved back, and none that were slab serifs with this kind of 'k'. If this is
    a logo, and not just the name of a rare New Zealand parrot species, I'd say the
    odds of being custom lettering are high.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
