    because of its weight, my love for humor and Oz Coopers humor. People don't buy
    names! But they do buy hundreds of products that employ Pooper Black.\r\n\r\nJust
    \"taking care of business\" according to Office Depot."

    for your sarcasm, Hrant. The subtlety, or hidden meaning, did not go unnoticed
    :-)\r\n\r\nI know how you love hand rendered fonts!\r\n\r\np.s. If it was not
    intended the way I think it was then I graciously accept the post."
