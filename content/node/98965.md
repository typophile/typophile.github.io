  Burian's multi-award winning type family [[http://www.type-together.com/maiola|Maiola]]
  has grown even bigger. Its Pan-European OpenType Pro version now supports, in addition
  to Cyrillic and Latin A, full polytonic Greek. The calligraphic details of Maiola
  collaborate gracefully with each of the three scripts and generate a sense of consistent
  personality that creates a welcoming tension on the page. The polytonic extension
  was done by Greek specialist Irene Vlachou.\r\n\r\nMore information about Maiola

    mark.\r\nThe same ductus works well for marks combining the inverted breve form
    of perispomeni (rather than the tilde variant) over a breathing mark.\r\nAll very
    neat. Respect!"
