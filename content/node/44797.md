  but it referenced appearance of black in PDF (on monitor) and did not address my
  particular problem:\r\n\r\nIn InDesign, my type is set to [Black]. When I print
  directly from ID, only black ink is used. When I export to PDF and then print, type
  is printed in CMYK rich black. I don't want this. (Oddly, 50% tint of [Black] prints
  with color, but 50% opacity of [Black] uses only black ink. A gradient from 100%
  [Black] to [Paper] uses only black ink.)\r\n\r\nI have already adjusted my \"appearance
  of black\" options to not view or output as rich black, instead to output blacks
  accurately. I have tried various combinations of PDF export options, using No Color
  Conversion and different settings with the profiles. I've tried changing my color
  settings as well, using various Color Management options... this makes no difference.\r\n\r\nClearly
  something in the process of exporting to PDF is overriding what I want. What am
  I missing?? I'm going CRAZY.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I asked the color guy here and got this response:\r\n-------------------------\r\nProbably
    the first question is whether the PDF itself contains the rich black or the rich
    black only appears when printing the PDF. Based on the description I think I lean
    toward the latter. If that\u2019s correct then it may be an Acrobat color management
    issue. One way to find out is to place the resulting PDF into a new ID doc and
    print and see if you get rich black output. If you do, the PDF is bad, and if
    you don\u2019t, it\u2019s an Acrobat thing. (This assumes your color settings
    are configured with a CMYK profile policy of \u201COff\u201D or \u201CPreserve
    Numbers\u201D.) \r\n\r\nThe default PDF export presets in ID should not include
    any profiles for the text, although for PDF/X variants the output intent will
    imply one. If Acrobat is configured to use that profile and its print dialog is
    configured in such a way that you are requesting a conversion, you\u2019ll get
    one, and your text will go 4c. The gradients are specified as DeviceN which would
    escape the conversion. The tint vs opacity example is strange; if anything I would
    expect it the other way around, but that\u2019s only based on a guess as to what
    may be happening. \r\n-------------------------\r\nHope this helps.  Not my area.\r\n"
