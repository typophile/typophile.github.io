  seems to be Franklin Gothic, but bolder and the 'S' is different.\r\n\r\nMany thanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "The Carling ad uses a bold condensed weight of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/beton_sh_extra_bold_condensed/?&sample_text=Carling%20Black%20Label&sample_size=48&acs_pt=32&update=0\">Beton</a>.
    Maybe a slanted style was available in pre-digital times. And you\u2019ll have
