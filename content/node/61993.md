body: "I'm going to be in Madrid around the last days of October until mid January
  & I was wondering if someone knows if there is a Type Design Workshop in the area.
  I have already googled for some, but everything I find is mostly design workshops
  where they introduce you to type use or masters in typography which are out of my
  budget. \r\nI'm from Peru & no such workshops ever occur here, so I would like to
  gain some typographic design experience while I'm overseas, either by taking part
  in a workshop or by helping around as an intern in a foundry or with a typographer
  while I'm there.\r\nI would appreciate any feedback on the subject.\r\n"
