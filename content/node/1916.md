    or need to shovel more than 15cm of snow off the driveway, it&#39;s shorts weather.
    <BR> <BR>Joe - there are laws like that in Quebec too.

  body: This reminds me of a guy who goes to my school. This past winter he wore shorts
    every single day. Everyone would ask him, &#34;why are you wearing shorts?&#34;
    He would reply, &#34;Because I&#39;m hot.&#34; Even with the blizzards and everything.
    Still with the shorts. Then the first day it broke 60 degrees, he wore pants.
    I saw him walk down the street and someone shouted out him, &#34;Why are you wearing
    pants?&#34; and he said, &#34;Because I&#39;m cold!&#34; The biggest setup for
    a punchline I&#39;ve ever experienced.

    Think of it as a great way for different cultures to start a conversation from
    a mutual base-ground. I suggest the next peace-talks between the Israelis and
    the Palestinians &#40;whenever that happens&#41; should use the promissing new

    what could work, pray tell?
