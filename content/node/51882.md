  You\u2019d have to give me a lot of time anyway. Among the many uses I have for
  it, one of them is keeping a scrapbook of everything typographically interesting
  I come across. If you\u2019d like, you can explore it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.evernote.com/pub/mrh/typography\r\n\r\nOr,
  you can grab the rss feed for it [[http://feeds.feedburner.com/evernotetypography|here]].\r\n\r\nI
  update it on a highly irregular basis."
