body: So, I know that this is called PioneerScript (even though it looks quite a bit
  like P22's Cezanne), but I can't find the source. Anyone seen it before and know
  what foundry it's from?

    Cezanne</a>. Note that the Pro version has a lot of alternate characters (incl.
    those present in your sample) \u2013 accessible via OpenType features \u2013 that
    help evoke a more natural, handwritten feel.\r\nF"

  body: "Aha! Thanks Florian. I wondered how it could be so close yet not be Cezanne,
    but the only version I have of Cezanne is an older PostScript version without
    the alternate characters. I figured this was just somebody's knockoff.\r\n\r\nThe
    strange thing is that it was a missing font in a .PSD that Photoshop was identifying
    as [PioneerScript Text]. That'll teach me to trust those sneaky bastards at Adobe.
