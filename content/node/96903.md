  body: "The <strong>Q</strong> is fairly certain to be custom of course so the ID
    is really of the <strong>tips</strong>. Looking at a larger version of the logo
    to see the details more closely I\u2019d say there\u2019s a reasonable chance
    that\u2019s custom also, loosely based on the pre-digital master."
