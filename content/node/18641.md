  the question in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/13346">this thread</a> that
  I want answers to: What purpose does faceting serve? Does it really help text fonts
  at small sizes? If so can anyone explain how? Thanks for looking...'

  body: "I've observed as I've been working, that a smooth curve as small sizes can
    become a corner. After a minute adjustment it remains a curve. The reverse can
    be true too. Consider Emigre's Journal. I'm not sure that it's *better* or worse,
    just a different way of working. I'd love to hear more from John, as the results
    seem to be working well.\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: Tiff, i started a wiki entry on the M-Formula on what I could find online.
    If you have time, could you contribute to that one and summarize better than I
    did? Thanks for pointing me to this!
