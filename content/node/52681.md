  will be used as a marketing research tool. It is called \"A Fish in the Water\",
  which suggests that the people will feel comfortable there. I like the idea, you
  get the fish n the water, sense of being part of something\u2014community. Only
  problem is that I'm not sure if I've seen a similar idea somewhere, I don't think
  so, but you probably know the feeling, you've seen so many logos, that you're not
  sure if this image wasn't just stuck somewhere at the back of your brain. The only
  similar identity i recall is one for Tackle Design by Fredrik Lewander, but it is
  different enough. Thanks. Jan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fish_4068.jpg]"

  body: "Hello, Jan! Congratulations on the logo, I like it very much. As for resemblances,
    it does remind me a little of the work Chermayeff&Geismar did for the Oceanario
    de Lisboa (sorry, I don't know how to insert a link), the Tennessee Aquarium or
    the National Aquarium in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nBut don't worry, I think your logo
    is unique enough and I can really see the community in there."

  body: "Lex and Sebastian,\r\nthanks a lot for your comments. Oceanario de Lisboa
    is pretty close, that must have been the one my logo reminded me of, I have seen
    it before, but i agree that it is still different enough. I'll keep my fingers
    crossed :-)"
