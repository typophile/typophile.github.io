    like an improved version of Monotype Garamond) and Garamont by Lettergieterij
    Amsterdam (a copy of the design by Morris Fuller Benton for ATF) should also be
    on a list of <em>faux</em> Garamonds.

    body: "\xB6 The Ludlow version displays too much contrast so it can't be French
      Renaissance.\r\n\r\nDear Stefan Miklos, why should high contrast not be a feature
      of French Renaissance / Garalde? The display sizes of Garamond and other typefaces
      from that era had a higher stroke contrast than the smaller sizes. I think we
      should not mix up high contrast as in French Renaissance display sizes with
      thin(ner) hairlines as in Bodoni / Didonic typefaces. Due to the pointed-nib
      stroke contrast, which is typical for Bodoni / Didonic typefaces, the horizontal
      curves in lower case characters have far less weight, resulting in more thin
      hairlines as in French Renaissance / Garalde. From this point of view, in Bodoni
      / Didonic typefaces contrast is not necessarily higher, it is only more apparent
      in horizontal curves. In short: we should not mix up between size of contrast
      and kind of contrast.\r\nBack to high contrast: What happened is that with the
      introduction of large drawings for the pantographic engraving machines in the
      19th centuries prints of large type sizes were used for rendering rather prints
      with small sizes. Taking in account that the Ludlow machines were originally
      conceived and most used for casting headline sizes, it seems that using large
      sizes of metal type to create drawings for the pantographic matrix engraver
      was a good idea at Ludlow. Using these designs for digitizations of typefaces
      that are also intended for use in text sizes seems like less brilliant idea.
      \r\nUnfortunately it took a rather long time before the drawing offices and
      typeface designers became fully aware of the consequences of downscaling large
      sizes for small sizes. Also the phototypesetting era and digital typesetting
      preceding PostScript and TrueType, not much attention was paid to this. The
      introduction of optical sizes, followed by the optical axe in Variable Fonts
      are the first wide-scale attempts to solve the problem of scaling. "

  body: "Looking it up, it apparently was based partly on Garamond and (to a lesser
    extent) partly on Caslon; it was a custom typeface created for the Canadian publication
    <em>Maclean's</em> magazine. (Maclean's is Canada's major weekly news magazine,
    competing against TIME and Newsweek.)\r\n\r\nLooking at the specimen on MyFonts,
    it didn't seem to have the distinctive \"Garamond\" feel I associate with the
    Jannon-based \"fake\" Garamonds, however, I wouldn't say that this necessarily
    brings it closer to the \"real\" Garamonds; it could, but I don't feel qualified
    to judge that."
