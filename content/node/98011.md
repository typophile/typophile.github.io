body: "Any suggestions for typefaces for a website? Arial is so much clearer than
  Helvetica in small sizes. Georgia is so common.\r\n\r\nOne typeface should be neutral
  and be easy to read at small sizes.\r\nThe other typeface should be elegant, but
  simple and also be easy to read at small sizes."

  body: It's hard to be elegant at the flyspeck sizes used on most web sites, but
    check out Webtype's RE (Reading Edge) series. One of those might be your Sailor
    Neptune.
