    elaborat:\r\n\r\nin a magazine after the article is written sometimes there would
    be included details on the writer, like: you can contact the writer at.. or the
    writer is ...\r\n\r\nso this is one of the details that i want to find the best
    way to put.. as:\r\nthe font might be smaller\r\nand the leading less\r\nand the
    seperation between main article and this boiler plate (as we call it where i work)
    to be obvious..\r\n\r\nso I suggested here to have a thin line like seperation,
    and i called it for me to know: baseline line! is there a name for it, like hairline
    seperation? or just a seperation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin this thread i want to document
    various ways to present various information.."
