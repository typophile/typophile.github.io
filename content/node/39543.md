body: "There are gimmicky fonts and there are solid fonts. The gimmicky ones are fleeting.
  Cool for a moment, but they tire quickly. Emigre and T-26 and even some Underware
  fonts in time will look the same way. Then there are typefaces that feel standard,
  that feel timeless and hardworking -- by that I mean versatile, usable, readable.
  The problem with those two extremes is you want something that works hard, but that
  feels fresh. Something that will last but that will still let you pull out some
  surprise and some sparkle in your system. A few typefaces come to mind -- Meta ([[Erik
  Spiekermann]]) had that quality. And more recently Amplitude ([[Christian Schwartz]])
  and Pill Gothic ([[Christian Robertson]]).\r\n\r\nNow enters Freight ([[Joshua Darden]]).
  In the standard sizes it looks fairly standard/normal but then you get to weights
  like Freight Micro, and Freight Display Italic where it takes on a display quality
  that I love and can't wait to find the right moment to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/idlemode_logo_4632.gif]\r\nFreight

  body: "Before it went under not too long ago, Jane magazine was set almost entirely
    in Freight, with the A-heads in that gorgeous display black italic. \r\n\r\nMost
    larger families strive toward making gradients out of opposites. Light/black,
    sans/serif, text/display, etc. But Freight manages also to successfully reconcile
    being conservative with being outright quirky. I wish I owned it : ("
