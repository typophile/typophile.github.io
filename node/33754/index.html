  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello fellow typophiles!
Not sure about you lot but when I left
my undergraduate studies I was charged up with
motivation and vigour and ready to set the world on
fire with my typographic innovation.
But six years have passed and I have had a wide variety
of experience from major UK publishers to music magazines
to starting my own practice.
and I have only used vetica 3 times!</p>
<p>But I have reached a stage where I need some new
direction / inspiration [you know what I mean] 
As a result I have been thinking about doing a
a sagmeister and having a year without clients /
re-exploring what got me excited about typo-based-graphic-design
in the first place.
so I was thinking about working toward doing some post graduate
studies / locking myself in the shed with a laptop and a printer
for a year&hellip;
Can anybody advise on what they would do /
what schools to look at
[as you only get one chance and it costs you a lot of cash]
I love European typography
and can&rsquo;t get enough of Berlin</p>
<p>But this looks pretty mental</p>
<p><a href="http://www.werkplaatstypografie.org/">http://www.werkplaatstypografie.org/</a></p>
<p>I know others out there are thinking the same
where did the enthusiasm go</p>
<p>any advice or discussion would 
be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>Simon</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Since I don&rsquo;t know you and don&rsquo;t know what you are interested in, could you perhaps enlighten me? I agree that some kind of study would be a good thing, but there are so many different paths to take, so what discourse are you into? By the way I applied for the Werkplaats this year, so fingers crossed, knock on wood, salt over the shoulder.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Claus,
Thanks for the reply. 
Thats whats weird about posting such things.
Your reply sent me off on a sideways journey and I ended up deciding to make a web-page that I can keep referring to until I decide where to go with all of this. 
This is the link to the page you inspired:
<a href="http://web.mac.com/eskimographicdesign/iWeb/Site/Typo_Files/Typo_Files.html">http://web.mac.com/eskimographicdesign/iWeb/Site/Typo_Files/Typo_Files.html</a></p>
<p>Have a look below and perhaps we could discuss it further&hellip;
The very best of luck to you with werkplaats application, I was thinking about visiting this summer is it far from Amsterdam?</p>
<p>It would be great to continue/start a discussion about typographic discourse with you.</p>
<p>Anyway have a read and thank you again.</p>
<p>O.K here goes:
I’m interested in designing meaningful communication with typography as its primary
method of delivering that message. When we say meaningful its more to do with who we communicate on behalf of. Ideally we try and succeed 96.8% of the time to produce design for organisations that are not predominately led by profit.
So guess that is more about the type of work I am drawn to from a client / commissioned point of view. The way I see it if you don’t design your work for clients and its not actual ‘living’ design you are not a designer. This to me is more like art, as what is design without a purpose? 
What am I interested in as an approach to the above, trying not to follow fashion or be influenced too much by the zeitgeist, ‘style not fashion’ is a bit of a mantra to me.
I’m fascinated by the tone of voice / character specifying typography can create.
I was playing today with using a serif ‘utopia’ on a community sport poster. 
It looked wrong but I was very interested in why it was wrong.
this wrongness I like to play with but it tends to be where I depart from what I call serious design. As time wares on I care less and less about this.
The Alan Fletcher exhibition reminded me you can have fun and play with type and language. I have been putting this into place recently with: 
Teachers Museum Project
Dual Existence Film titles
Artists catalogue - fur tongues
Photography exhibition catalogue
Community sport posters
We also have a visual identity for a film production organisation.
and have been specifically asked to be ‘playful’
So I’m addressing the logical and trying to release the playful me.</p>
<p>With regards to what discourse am I into?
What a magnificent question:
Not really sure what is on offer.
I’m a neo-modernist / digital dada-ist / absurdist rationalist
I’m really interested in people and exploring how design can enrich
peoples lives.
What are you into Claus?
I am a bit stuck here&hellip;</p>
