  font. I've been looking for samples were the font was first used. Centaur was designed
  for the The Metroplitan Museum in 1914, but I can not find any samples. Does anyone
  know of some good websites that show samples and indepth information for typography.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    had as part of the collection the patterns for Lanston's version of Centaur/Metropolitan.\r\n\r\nI
    recall that he had some correspondence with the Met where it came to light that
    they still had the metal type down in the basement that had come from their in-house
    letterpress printshop.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth while to contact the museum and
    see if they can give you any rare insde information on the type.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\nJim "
