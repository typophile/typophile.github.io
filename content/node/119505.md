    kerning or GPOS kerning? What kind of file are you exporting? What solutions have
    you tried? \r\n"

      (Still trying to learn the basics). So, not quite sure if I have tested Kern
      table kerning or GPOS kerning... Would you please tell me the difference? How/where
      do I choose one over the other?\r\n\r\nI have used kerning classes and generated
      as both TrueType/OpenType TT and OpenType PS.\r\n\r\nI have tried checking only
      one, and both of these:\r\n- Export old-style non-OpenType \"kern\" table\r\n-
      Generate OpenType \"kern\" feature\r\n\r\nHope this makes any sense..\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

    Google search for \"site:typophile.com microsoft word kerning\" will turn up a
    lot of threads on the topic. I suggest starting there. And: I\u2019m not sure
    if MS Word still defaults to no kerning. You used to have to change the preferences
    to use the kerning with older versions.\r\n\r\nLykke til!"

  body: "Not to mention the obvious, but in MS Word, unlike most graphic apps, you
    have to check a little box saying you'd like kerning. Otherwise MS Word assumes
    kerning is too trivial to come in by default. ;-)\r\n\r\nI have the 2010 version
    and it still requires you to check the box for kerning."

    have also noticed that the kerning is missing from most font menus/previews, both
    in Word as well as Indesign. May this be caused by the same problem?"

  body: "Kenneth, I would strongly suggest you learn about the 2 types of kerning,
    the newer class based kerning and the old-time Type1 kerning table and how they
    interact in FontLab. It's pretty cool/well done, actually. It helps to understand
    things better and allows you to check your settings for both opening existing
    fonts and generating fonts. Word 2003 does NOT support the class based kerning
    but it should use the older style kern tables and you have to tell Studio (not
    sure of the default there) to include that when you generate an OTF or TTF. Tools,
    Options > Generating OpenType & TrueType > Kerning and turn on the \"Export old-style
    non-OpenType \"kern\" table.\"\r\n\r\nThat said, I beat my head against the wall
    for a week or more but was never able to get Word 2003 to use the kerning in an
    OTF font. Generating a TTF DID work in 2003. Word 2010 DOES use the kerning in
    the OTF fonts I've generated.\r\n\r\nIf you're opening old Word files in 2010
    (I don't know about 2007 or after 2010) you'll need to take it out of Compatibility
    Mode. By default Word 2010 opens documents created in older versions of Word in
    Compatibility Mode to help minimize reflow of text. At least, I THINK that's why
    they did that.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, if you find a solution please be sure to
    post back.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\nKen"
