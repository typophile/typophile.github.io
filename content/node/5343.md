  body: No, it&#39;s definately called Preserve Transparency.  I&#39;ve seen pictures
    of it on other versions of Photoshop, and it&#39;s there when I go to Edit &#62;
    Fill, but for some reason I can&#39;t find it on the layers pallette.

    the opaque portions of the layer. This option is equivalent to the Preserve Transparency
    option in earlier versions of Photoshop.&#34;'
