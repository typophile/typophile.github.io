    Caslon</a> is probably your best bet. I'm not sure how widespread its use would
    have been in Scotland mid-century, but it had already made a big impression in
    England and was very popular. Prior to Caslon, most British printing used fairly
    generic and undistinguished late renaissance types, and the use of these likely
    persisted in Scotland, Wales and Ireland longer than in England.\r\n\r\nI can
    also recommend Traquair's <a href=\"http://www.traquair.co.uk/breweryales.html\">Jacobite
    Ale</a> to drink while you are working on this project."
