  body: "Hi Mike, I looked all the places I could think of for hand-drawn serifs and
    only found a few similar styles -- no exact matches. Nick Curtis's \"Hobby Horse\"
    was one of them. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: This is a tough one - those left leaning serifs just do not compute - will

  body: "If this is a font, it might be worth visiting the Mecca for hand drawn fonts,
    Creative Market https://creativemarket.com/fonts\r\nUnfortunately there is no
    index or usable set of category tags that I can find. So without knowing a name
    a brute force attack is needed to find the hidden gems.\r\nThis search https://creativemarket.com/search?q=+hand-drawn+serifs
    produced a manageable 246 results, with some passable substitutes, but I did not
    spot an exact match. Of course I might have missed it.\r\nThe search https://creativemarket.com/search?q=serif&sort=relevance
    produces 1644 results. I did not check it closely.\r\nDon"
