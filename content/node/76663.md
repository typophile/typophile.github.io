    custom values, they appear without the parenthesis.\r\n"

  body: But this is odd, no kerning visible between the pair of glyphs in InDesign...

  body: r-t-l kerning is a little tricky. You can't just adjust the kern values like
    you would in l-t-r languages. You need to adjust both the position and kerning
    values (and  IIRC it does not really display correctly in VOLT). I don't remember
    the details and I don't have VOLT with me to check and remind myself how it was
    done.

  body: "Actually, it seems like an ID CS5 bug. It works perfect in CS4, CS3. ID gets
    it all wrong when it needs to display RTL kerned glyphs, while Illustrator does
    it just fine.\r\n\r\nA bug report is cooking. Thanks anyway."

    in CS5...

  body: "Simple kern tables? In Fontlab?\r\n\r\nI have never been able to make basic
    kern tables work for r-t-l fonts in any version of InDesign. The only way I was
    successful was with VOLT. (I suppose it can be done now with AFDKO, but I haven't
    done any OT work in a while.)\r\n\r\nYou need more advanced GPOS tables than what
    Fontlab produces (but like I mentioned before I don't remember the details). The
    GPOS table used four values rather than a single kern value..."
