  student.) Critique would be gratefully accepted. This is just the front page, but
  it gives a pretty good idea of how the entire paper is going to look.\r\n\r\nI'm
  using Minion Pro for body copy, Chaparral Pro for headlines, captions, and some
  text, Clan Narrow Bold for the flag, and Alternate Gothic No. 2 for the big front
  page headline and some other text. (All these typefaces are either included with
  InDesign or available for free from the foundry's website - we don't have much of
  a budget.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://negativeboy.com/dropbox/typophile/edge0315.pdf\">The

  body: "Nice layout.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that Chaparral and Minion are too cool
    and \"bookish\" for a newspaper.\r\nNewspapers need something in your face, tight,
    and rough around the edges, to make the news fresh and, well \"edgy\".\r\n\r\nYou've
    captured that feel in the all-caps stacked head.\r\n\r\nSo I would see if Utopia
    is one of the free fonts, big on the body, it's a proven news text font.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sam, This looks really good. A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- For captions which
    use quotes, hang them.\r\n- Because you are tinting the page numbers, I don't
    think you need a full space.\r\n- Try to design around having to right justify.
    I'm specifically referring to the image/text combination in the bottom right.
    \r\n- The rules above and below the byline seem to be an odd length. This could
    be a personal preference thing.\r\n- The paragraph indents could be smaller.\r\n-
    The UPCOMING EVENTS box: I think that text could be larger, add more contrast
    to the overall page.\r\n\r\nI love to see Chaparal being used. It is such a warm
    typeface, and it works very well with Minion.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I'm not
    sold on is the flag. It seems squooshed into that space. DId you try right justifying
    it and having the rule below end right before it?\r\n"

  body: I can see your point, Nick, about Minion. Utopia could be interesting.

    for under $100 in the Typefaces for Education collection.

    Charter</a> is also a proven newspaper text face. The Seattle Times uses it. And
    you can get the 4 base styles for free. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utopia/\">Utopia</a>
    is also available for the free software community, but in order to use it on a
    Mac you would need to convert it.\r\n\r\nAs to the design, I happen to be a Chapparal
    hater. If you insist on using it for a headline, use the bolder versions. The
    weight you have is too light to really stand out from the overall gray color of
    the page.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might consider losing a few of the horizontal rules.Your
    first column has 3 rules before you even get to your lead sentence.  That's too
    much eye dirt that a person has to fight through to get to the actual meat of
    the story. \r\n\r\nDitto on the indents. A good rule is to set the indent to the
    size of your text, an EM space. "

    design.</a>\r\n\r\nI have:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>reduced the indents</li>\r\n<li>given
    the flag more space</li>\r\n<li>removed the extra spaces before the page numbers</li>\r\n<li>hung
    the pull quote</li>\r\n<li>increased the upcoming events size</li>\r\n<li>increased
    the weight of the Chapparal headline</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI haven't changed any of
    the typefaces or the rules. I don't have any of the fonts suggested, and it's
    a real pain to get them installed on school computers (since the IT guy has to
    install them on each computer individually). I might try changing them for a later
    edition."
