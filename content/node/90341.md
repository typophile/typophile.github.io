    same metrics, kerning, etc. However, I can see the point of temporarily using
    another font's metrics (and all the rest) when testing it during the design process,
    instead of constantly having to adjust the spacing and kerning as you change the
    glyphs. Furthermore, if the fonts are similar, I wouldn't mind at all if someone
    just took another fonts metrics and changed them a bit to fit his/her own font.
    It's more efficient in some cases and you can hardly call metrics intellectual

    target, it sounds viable. For example, replacing Arial with a custom font in a
    company's Word templates. (I believe there is a set of fonts in the DBType family
    that does exactly that.) You could be pretty sure that kerning isn't used, so
    keeping the horizontal glyph metrics (and vertical font metrics!) should be enough.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're targeting InDesign, you need to take into account kerning and other OpenType
    features that are on by default (ligatures, contextual alternates).\r\n\r\nThere
    can be some glyphs that severely limit your choices when you want to stay compatible.
    For example, an uppercase I with serifs in a sans face (e.g. Verdana). You just
    can't make it sans-serif and keep the advance width the same.\r\n\r\nOn a side
    note, in the IBM Selectric Composer the characters were proportionally spaced,
    but every letter had to have the exact same width in all fonts! Frutiger notes
    in his big book that he had to compromise on his Univers adaptation because the
    engineers had chosen a Renaissance face as their model for the character widths.
    E.g. the s in the Composer Univers looks much too narrow."

    your rationale for this? It's a lengthy process to settle on really good metrics.
    Also, as many have observed, a well-spaced font with some bad curves is more useable
    than a poorly-spaced font with amazing curves. I see metrics as an integral part
    of the design process, requiring just as much skill as the actual drawing, if
    not more. \r\n\r\nEven if there's no legal copyright infringement, I would personally
    consider it bad practice that raises ethical issues."

    don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily so. Often the impetus to provide an alternative

    that its based on the Adobe vs SSI case, in which the placement of bezier points
    was held to be a copyrightable expression, since different people will place the
    points differently around the same shape, when digitizing an existing design that
    is scanned into the computer as a bitmap and traced by hand with a bezier tool.
    \r\n\r\nFollowing that logic, I can see how the metrics would not be subject to
    copyright, because anyone would copy the metrics of the original in the same way.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, that court case is years later than the classic Bitstream/URW/ScanGraphic/etc
