  logo variations.\r\n\r\nI tried WhatTheFont, and I went through the Handwritten
  and Graffiti font lists on Dafont, all with no luck.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize
  this font? I'm hoping that the really distinctive \"G\" will be helpful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontsample_5641.png]"
