  body: "I've seen things I'd rather pay money for, hanging on the office wall of
    a co-worker, done by his 11 year old daughter. But no accounting for taste.\r\n\r\n(The
    words Goudy-Schmoudy come to mind)\r\n: )"

    in the top right seems a bit confused.

  body: Goudy's printed signature on his early work reproduced from drawings is not
    cursive - the signature and the fact he is not known for ever doing a non-objective
    drawing would seem to prove it is not "our" Goudy.

  body: "Goudy would have signed it F W Goudy if it were his, plus the style is all
    wrong for his work. He would not have done a drawing like this. The Goudy's did
    have children, a son and daughter if I recall correctly, so perhaps it was one
    of them. Or someone else entirely. Goudy is not that unusual a name outside of
    typography; there were a few unrelated Gouidy families in the Chicago area before
    WWII. \r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man
    who had no Bodoni"
