  body: Do your OT features involve substitution from or by '.null' glyph? Or did
    you kern it with another glyph? Then try removing this kerning pair in the metrics
    panel, update the kern feature, and generate the font again.

    them, set the Font Window to Index Mode, then pull the glyphs the the correct
    place.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant was, make sure '.null' is not mentioned in any feature."

    <Mint-Medium> invalid first character in name (text was \"01e9\")</code>\r\n\r\nU+01e9
    is kcircumflex. I've tried deleting this glyph, I've tried regenerating the kern
    feature and I've run the above solutions but still get the same error.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    this is something straightforward...I don't like FATAL errors...can anyone shed
    any light ;)"

  body: "Well you've awakened an old thread, but it doesn't look like the original
    problem was ever fully sussed out. The \"name\" in question is the glyph name,
    which must conform to some rules established by Adobe quite a long time ago. Some
    font tools are more lenient than others with respect to glyph names, and sometimes
    a tool can assign an illegal name. This can cause trouble when another tool expects
    or requires strictly legal names and that is what's going on here.\r\n\r\nFrom
    http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyphnamelimits.html section 4 (emphasis
    mine):\r\n\r\n<code>A glyph name may be up to 31 characters in length, must be
    entirely comprised of characters from the following set:\r\n\r\nA-Z\r\na-z\r\n0-9\r\n.
    (period)\r\n_ (underscore)\r\nand <strong>must not start with a digit or period</strong>.
    The only exception is the special character \".notdef\".\r\n\r\n\"twocents\",
    \"a1\", and \"_\" are valid glyph names. \"2cents\" and \".twocents\" are not.</code>\r\n\r\nBoth
    of the glyph names here violate the emphasized part above; \".null\" begins with
    a period and \"01e9\" begins with a digit.\r\n\r\nTo fix the \"invalid first character
    in name\" issue, you need to change the glyph name(s), not delete the glyph. There
    may be other glyphs with illegal names, too. You might try FontLab Studio's function
    to assign glyph names based on Unicode if you have a lot to rename.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> must not start with a digit or period.\r\n\r\nInteresting. I'll check through
    all the names. I think they're in the format uni1234 but some could just be 1234.
    If I use the 'assign glyph names' function, the classes and features will all
    need search/replace too right?\r\n\r\nI've a feeling I might just have to wipe
    my kerning classes and start again. Before I made the classes (and changed the
    glyph order) the opentype features were compiling correctly.\r\n\r\nI'll let you
    know how I get on. Thanks for the pointers."

  body: "Ok well it looks like there was something not right in the kerning classes.
    I wiped them, reassigned glyph names, then remade the kerning classes. With the
    new glyph names I had to search/replace in the other feature definitions. Now
    it compiles correctly and I get great looking opentype class kerning! :)\r\n\r\n(PS
    there's now a warning that <code>[WARNING] <Mint-Medium> Start of new pair positioning
    subtable; some pairs may never be accessed: [z zacute zdotaccent zcaron uni01B6]
    [t uniFB06 ct ft ft.alt it]</code> but I'll live with that unless I can figure
    out what to do about that...)"
