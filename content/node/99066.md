body: Hi there, this is my first post here! I have a client for whom I need to do
  a one page advert, and I'm trying to make the header the same font as the one they've
  used on their website here - http://clovelly.co.za/ - I'm talking about the bold
  sans serif font that says "Clovelly Country Club" in yellow and white next to the
  logo. If anyone could identify this for me it would be great!
