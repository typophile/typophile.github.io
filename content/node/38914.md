body: When I buy text families from Adobe or Monotype, I know that I will always be
  able to go from roman to italic (if not also to bold and bold italic) by means of
  keyboard shorthand commands. But when I buy from the more boutique foundries, like
  FontShop or FontFont, it's a real crap throw whether roman will link to italic or
  just turn up that fake cursive. And whenever I ask them beforehand, they never seem
  able to tell me, or won't. Why can't all foundries create reliable links, at least
  from roman to italic...and can anything be done to remedy this as a more consistent
  industry standard?

  body: I do use style sheets whenever there is more than one bold weight, but I should
    be able to keyboard-command from a roman to its italic without setting up style
    sheets. It should always be as simple and reliable as it is with the big boys.
    Adobe, ITC, and Monotype never leave this aspect of their font engineering undone,
    so why do smaller foundries think they can ignore it?

  body: "mondoB -- <cite>Adobe, ITC, and Monotype never leave this aspect of their
    font engineering undone, so why do smaller foundries think they can ignore it?</cite>\r\n\r\nSmaller
    foundries do not \"think they can ignore it.\" Actually there are good reasons
    for avoiding style linking.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, style linking works <cite>really</cite>
    reliable only with 4-style families which Windows regards as the one-and-only
    way a family should be look like: Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic. More than
    two weights, Regular and Bold, were not anticipated.\r\nAs soon as a family has
    more than these two weights, a foundry has a few options:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;avoid
    style linking altogether,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;only style link
    each weight to its according italic,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;style
    link both italic and bold; therefore split what is a big family in InDesign, into
    many 4-style families for Microsoft applications. This is what you seem to expect.
    But this does have nasty side effects too:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Take
    an Adobe font with five weights. It links Regular--Bold and Light--SemiBold. But
    -- no bold for the Black! In a way this is inconsistent too.**\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
    foundries (you have one in your list of good examples) only link Regular--Bold,
    but leave all other weights, Light, SemiBold, Black unlinked. Which means that
    if you select the Light and click B you get a fake bold. I doubt this is what
    you want.\r\n\r\nAnd there are more factors involved which help make sure that,
    as soon as one wants to style link more than the 5 weights (which seem to be the
    maximum in Adobe families), things will break in certain contexts. Believe it
    or not, sometimes the \"smaller foundries\" who \"think they can ignore it\" are
    a step ahead of what Adobe does -- downside is that there are no footsteps to
    follow because we're discovering yet untouched territory.\r\n\r\nIn so far, it
    is easiest and most reliable for a foundry to choose option (1) and just say:
    \"Never hit the B or I buttons!\"*\r\n\r\nYou are right that foundries should
    make it clear if their fonts are style linked or not, and how (bold, italic, or
    both). Some do.\r\n\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;No misreading please. I am not saying that
    what Adobe does is bad, but just point out that <cite>all</cite> approaches to
    work around the 4-style family limitation have their disadvantages.\r\n**&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking
    of WPF and future Vista application that may use it, however, (2) may turn out
    to be a better option than (1). So I am with you. Halfway.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\nSorry,
    even without technical details this turned into a longer post ...\r\n"

  body: 'I understand the ambiguity about style-linking more than one heavier weight,
    although you''d think smaller foundries would follow the solutions of Adobe and
    Monotype, or at least style-link each weight of roman to its italic. No, it''s
    when they just abandon the customer who buys a four-style "nuclear" family--especially
    without any consistency within the same foundry. Perfect example: FF Celeste,
    with all four fonts style-linked simply and reliably when used in Quark. Versus
    FF Scala, with NO style links for ANY of its same four fonts in Quark. Same foundry!
    And if my memory serves, my original version of Scala (since replaced for OSX)
    DID have those style links! This indifference to basic customer convenience can
    be a real burn--something that needs to be discussed industry-wide and remedied
    industry-wide, it seems to me.'

  body: "From a type designers point of view there are two kinds of customers: Office
    users and DTP users.\r\nThere are special packages for Office users where font
    families are limited to 4 styles and style linking works as expected. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=office\r\n\r\nIn
    a DTP environment the use of Bold and Italic buttons or shortcuts is not considered
    as an appropriate workflow. So for a type designer there is no need to jump through
    hoops to allow such a workflow. Just because some foundries do it, doesn't make
    it right.\r\nDefine paragraph and character styles for your bold and italic texts
    and apply the styles instead. \r\n(Not sure about Quark, but in InDesign you could
    define those globally, so they will appear automatically in EVERY new document.)"

  body: "Consider: If every single type design came with Regular, Bold, Italic and
    Bold Italic, then no matter how many other weights there were, you could rely
    on those 4 being style-linked. But that's not the case. There isn't an industry
    standard in the <strong>names</strong> of the various styles of a font family,
    much less a mandate that type families include Bold or Italic. We already know
    from other discussions that different applications see font style names differently,
    and some of them want Regular, Book, Plain, and other names to mean the same thing.
    \r\n\r\nBuilt into that is the pitfall Karsten mentions: If you are accustomed
    to using the keyboard styles, you can get something bolder when you hit the \"bold\"
    command, but it might be fake, smeared bold. The italic command can give you electronically
    sloped roman. Many people don't notice this onscreen, and oftentimes don't even
    notice this in print. Is that desirable? \r\n\r\nTo put a finer point on what
    Ralf said, graphic designers are trained not to use the keyboard shortcuts for
    the above reason and for others. It is a MS Word convention that has leaked into
    other areas, much like the 2-space convention of typewriting that no longer has
    a purpose. I hesitate to make the suggestion since you're so passionate about
    it, but because of the inconsistent way typefaces, applications, systems, and
    text engines behave, I recommend you change your habits: Refrain from using the
    keyboard shortcuts and either select styles from menus, or set up character styles.
    I think it's safe to say that the consistency you wish for will not happen any
    time soon. "

    hear, Carl. That's exactly why, as you say later, graphic designers are trained
    to stay away from QuarkXPress's Bold and Italic style buttons (I recently learned
