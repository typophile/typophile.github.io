  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a designer or typographer, just an editor. I edit a small-scale UK magazine. As well as covering current affairs we review films and music, but it&rsquo;s a pretty intelligent read &ndash; sophisticated but pretty sober. We&rsquo;re relaunching next month, going from a mono interior to full colour.</p>
<p>Obviously fonts are a pretty big deal. It&rsquo;s the designer&rsquo;s call, but I got a few books and read up just because typography interests me. I also read a bunch of blogs and forums.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing. I can&rsquo;t understand why Mrs Eaves wouldn&rsquo;t be a brilliant body text for us. I know it&rsquo;s pretty common now, and I know it draws attention to itself, but I like that it&rsquo;s full of character. In comparison most other things look bland, particularly the Baskerville alternatives that I get presented with.</p>
<p>The designer is with me to a certain extent. He says that he loves the way it looks, but that I should understand that typographers have a problem with it as a body text. Well, I guess I do, but only insofar as it wants to be seen. I do think it&rsquo;s readable despite all that.</p>
<p>If we use it it&rsquo;ll be 11.5 on 11.5, with column widths of around 75mm. We&rsquo;ll be printing onto good-quality 90gsm satin.</p>
<p>So, if you think my subscribers will benefit, please convince me that I&rsquo;m wrong (with alternatives). The only other font I&rsquo;ve seen that I really like is Fabiol, and I reckon you&rsquo;d think that was worse&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve set a book (over my protest) in Mrs. Eaves. The designer insisted on it. To my eye, it is so open &amp; gappy you can drive smallish trucks between the letters. When you look for type for body copy &ndash; text &ndash; don&rsquo;t look at individual letterforms first. Look at sentences, or at least groups of words. Once you find fonts where that is comfortable, then look at letterforms if you wish.</p>
<p>Yes, it is readable. I once had a famous designer call me &amp; exclaim &ldquo;I took all the word spaces out of the text, and I can still read it!&rdquo; I suppose you could. But why would anyone want to?</p>

<p>I think Mrs Eaves was meant to be a revival/reinterpretation of Baskerville.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen it used at small sizes, and for a lot of running text as in a magazine (But then 11.5 is not very small). Fabiol too has somewhat eccentric details for running text.</p>
<p>Why not set a page or two with actual content in both, and get a few people to read it. Or have you already?</p>

<p>The problem is that the fabulous character the makes Mrs. Eaves so great as, for example, a business card typeface, can get really tedious after a while. The funky spacing and generous overshoots are really cute in small doses, but compound them with the high-contrast of the text and you’re making a recipe for annoyance. Also, keep your printing techniques in mind; if this magazine is coming out of a not-so-great press on low-cost paper, as small magazines often are, the hairlines in a Baskerville will start to break up and disappear, especially if you use a color that isn’t very dark. Topping it off, there’s a very historical feel to any Baskerville design, and it’s going to look very odd as body copy in a contemporary music and film magazine.</p>
<p>Consider reserving Mrs. Eaves for flavor here and there in short articles, especially when the point size can be bumped up to compensate for magazine printing. But using it as body copy throughout probably won’t work out too well.</p>

<p><em>where clients are concerned a little knowledge can be very dangerous.</em>
Jeez Patty, that one of the most elitist things I&rsquo;ve heard in a while. Educating a client should look to make it easier for the designer, not harder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your designer is right. There are myriad reasons, such as such and such, why you should listen to your designer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How does that harm the designer? In fact, it might even lead to a greater appreciation of type, and that leads to not only better typography, but better sales for the type designers.</p>

It&rsquo;s just that, in a sense, I&rsquo;m not the real client &ndash; my subscribers are, and I have to believe I understand them better than anyone. That&rsquo;s also what the designer believes (or how he flatters me) and he seems keen to get my input. Of course I discuss this with him, I&rsquo;m just canvassing for a little opinion. Also, I wonder how much of this stuff comes down to fashion. I&rsquo;ve heard a number of things said about Mrs Eaves that just aren&quot;t true, and they appear to have been said as much in reaction to its popularity as to its inappropriateness.</p>
<p>Equally, not all designers have typography as a strength, and some advice from people who take it seriously has to be worth seeking.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that I was asking you to convince me! I wasn&rsquo;t looking for ammunition to use against my designer. We are both looking for font recommendations &ndash; something with character that will hold up to this sort of use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve trodden on any toes &ndash; I appreciate that I&rsquo;d get uppity if a designer tried to teach me how to edit. I&rsquo;m genuinely trying to take advantage of your knowledge.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan - way to overreact. I believe in educating the client as much as the next person. The problem comes, as Tiffany said, when the client thinks they know more than the designer. Or when they get an idee fixe about a design idea or a font and won&rsquo;t listen to other ideas. I had an editor recently who insisted the type be miniscule because that would make it look &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo;. Another client who won&rsquo;t allow purple because he read somewhere that purple doesn&rsquo;t sell. I felt sorry for the designer of my mother&rsquo;s book after she showed me the galleys and I marked up everything that didn&rsquo;t work. Believe me the design was terrible and needed help desperately, but the last thing that poor designer needed was the author&rsquo;s daughter telling her what to do.</p>
<p>In any event, showing is always more effective than telling when it comes to design.</p>

<p>No leading on an open spaced face like Mrs Eaves is not the best idea. The open look and poor kerning will accentuate the flaws even more so when it is tightly set like you suggest. As the film title says, A River Runs Through It.</p>

<p>And when you&rsquo;re doing that, it goes without saying that the results may not be the same as what a professional would have come up with. A year down you may not agree with your own earlier choices.</p>

<p>Mrs Eaves (remember, no dot after Mrs) was originally one of my favorites to use, but I feel as if it has a really strong &ldquo;voice.&rdquo; It has this very sophisticated and stodgy attitude about itself. It has such a characteristic look, that i feel it wouldn&rsquo;t look right next to certain images or for certain topics. I&rsquo;ve started feeling that way about a lot of Zuzana Licko typefaces (Emigre.com). Lately I&rsquo;ve been leaning more towards H&amp;FJ (typography.com). I haven&rsquo;t used them yet, but I love the type samples for Mercury and Chronicle.</p>

<p>IMO if you start off with something you like, you have a better chance of designing a page, and a magazine, that works as a whole, over time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the readability of faces can be considered apart from the layouts they&rsquo;re used in.
Perhaps it is the very &ldquo;gappiness&rdquo; of Mrs Eaves that some find a flaw, which can be a virtue in the hands of other designers, and in the eyes of readers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Zuzana Licko is quoted as saying:</p>
<p>“I think Mrs Eaves was a mix of just enough tradition with an updated twist. It’s familiar enough to be friendly, yet different enough to be interesting. Due to its relatively wide proportions, as compared with the original Baskerville, it’s useful for giving presence to small amounts of text such as poetry, or for elegant headlines and for use in print ads. It makes the reader slow down a bit and contemplate the message.&quot;</p>
<p>I think she is right.</p>
<p><cite> Eben, I believe Nick was referring to the woman, not the font&hellip;</cite></p>
<p>And what makes you say that?  Was she substantial? I have no idea what she was like in personality or form, but weight would not come into it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was talking about the typeface.
I suppose its proportions&ndash;small x-height and long extenders&ndash;might make it a bit twee, but its low contrast and lack of fussy details certainly don&rsquo;t.
In comparison, the recent types derived from Fleischmann, which have been used for magazine text, have quite mannered details.</p>
<p>But really, I don&rsquo;t believe that one should say &ldquo;oh, such and such typeface can&rsquo;t be used for such and such kind of work&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Having said that, I think Ms Licko&rsquo;s pushing it a bit to suggest Mrs Eaves for &ldquo;elegant headlines&rdquo;, unless they&rsquo;re small headlines, as it doesn&rsquo;t have optical scaling.</p>

<p><cite> But really, I don’t believe that one should say “oh, such and such typeface can’t be used for such and such kind of work”. </cite> I agree in general. There are choices that seem beyond good sense to me. I would almost certainly not set an entire novel in FF Amoeba for instance.</p>
<p>And moreover how a typeface strikes me is individual. It&rsquo;s how your audience feels ( or client&rsquo;s ) audience feels that will count.</p>

My in-house typesetter (when I was A.D. of a publishing house) used to go in and customize each font before she started. Hopefully InD will get with that program in the next upgrade.</div>
