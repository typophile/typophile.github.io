  body: "Riccardo, you've got me thinking\u2014I've seen some r\u2019s with ascenders
    (Cheltenham, for instance) that might be interesting in a unicase style. Lining
    glyphs are not a mandatory constraint of unicase, of course.\r\n\r\nRight Danny,
    I started out to do an OpenType upgrade to Panoptica, but got distracted\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks
    Ralf! What are your thoughts on Capital Sharp S in unicase? I treated sharp s
    as upper case in standard orthography, i.e. \u201C\xDF\u201D is rendered as double-s
    in both lower case and all-cap settings. This may not be ideal in mixed case (\u201CUnicase
    with Small Unicase\u201D) setting, but I don\u2019t really like that setting for
    this face, the two-size/two-case configuration is more of a convenience that provides
    a degree of size-specific variety for lining setting, which I assume will be the
    way that most users will set the face. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you do set the cap-eszett
    glyph in either upper or lower case, then it will correctly transpose in both
    \u201CAll Caps\u201D (case) and \u201CAll Small Caps\u201D (smcp) features.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I could have done a stylistic set with the lower case \u201C\xDF\u201D rendering
    in the cap-sharp-s form."
