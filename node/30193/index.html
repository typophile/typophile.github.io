  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m designing a logo for institute of answering religious Islamic questions. Here is my first design:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Religional_3871.png]</p>
<p>The institute owned by Islamic clerics that answers Islamic question by email, phone and oral. I would like to hear your opinions (any) about this logo</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about Islam to comment on your choice of symbols/characters and I would think that those are of primary importance for a logo of this kind. Therefore I can only comment on its aesthetics and exectution.</p>
<p>I like it, but&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the three elements (frame / three characters / star) need harmonizing. They each look like they are in a different style and would be better if they were all drawn with the same &lsquo;brush&rsquo; with the same stroke thickness and sharpeness or roundness.</p>
<p>The frame is inconsistent in itself. The seven arches are rounded at their base and apex (and a bit wobbly) whereas the bottom point is sharp, and if it&rsquo;s a book spine it needs some width.</p>
<p>The overall dimensions are rather square. It may look more elegant if it was taller, maybe with the dimensions of an archway.</p>
<p>The left and right characters (?) are a bit too close to frame. Maybe have those two less angled so the three of them form a more slender vertical shape.</p>
<p>On the frames bottom left and right corners the inside curve needs a smaller radius so the line doesn&rsquo;t appear to get thicker there.</p>
<p>Hope these comments are of some help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What about a cresent and a star? That symbolises Islam more than the star on its own. The strokes just seem too heavy. I think more experimentation may be needed in regards to that. The flames portray a &lsquo;heated debate&rsquo; to me. I don&rsquo;t know why but it&rsquo;s creating tension for me. Sorry but this is the truth. Just trying to help you in making it better.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mamouri: I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about the 3 characters being mistaken for flames. They aren&rsquo;t very flame like. I&rsquo;m guessing you have used them because they are a significant Arabic letter and they also look like the stroke of a question mark.</p>
<p>Missgiggles: I think a crescent and star would not be very original in Iran or the Muslim community.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Is the institute intended to answer questions from Muslims or non-Muslims or Arabic speakers or non-Arabic speakers? 
Is there going to be any type connected to it or should it work on its own? 
Doesn&rsquo;t Arabic uses a mirror image of the question mark?</p>
<p>I like the architectural qualities of the star and question marks, I feel the arches/petals should probably also be treated in a sharp-edged way, rather than rounded, there are certain inconsistencies in the execution, especially of the arches/petals, which will need to be ironed out. It might be easier to read/understand if there were only one question mark, do you have a reason why there are three?</p>
