  body: There were two that stuck with me, well sorta. I remember a film about C and
    R Eames and a film which I believe was called, "Design Wars". It documented the
    design proposals for the Chicago Library. To help facilitate the vetting process,
    all entrants had to commit to a prototype/mock up/model that would cost no less
    than one million dollars. [[http://www.movierevie.ws/movies/1654447/Design-Wars.html]]

    for General Motors, sure, but as a historical artifact of design culture, it's
