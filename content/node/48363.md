  show and share an opinion of fontdesign and all kind like this about.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"THORTL
  - a new heavy blackletter\"</strong>\r\nborn and was inpired of my love to \"Medieval
  concepts\". When I designed this font I'm not complicated so much to myself about
  its shapes cuz I concentrated on a simple construction and keep two constant ideas
  on mind: one, that must be the readable and two, must keep the main concept. this
  is all.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thortl-webshow_typophile_4334.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow
