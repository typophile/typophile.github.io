body: Greetings <BR> <BR>Can I get some advice about which Bodoni to buy ? Do you
  have a preference and why? <BR> <BR>And in general, I am baffled about this question
  whenever I go to buy a font where there&#39;s more than one version from different
  foundries / vendors.  Are there certain companies that are considered better than
  others? I read a lot of ITC bashing -- should I steer clear of their products? &#40;I
  have managed to figure out that ITC Garamond looks pretty dated.&#41;  Is Elsner
  &amp; Flake Bodoni considered superior to &#40;say&#41; Bitstream and Linotype,
  and that&#39;s why it&#39;s more expensive? <BR> <BR>Any help you can offer me is
  greatly appreciated.

  body: ITC Bodoni is the MOST superior for several reason. Most important of which
    is the fact that it has given the user optical choice.

  body: Even though I like neither Bodoni nor ITC, I have to admit that ITC Bodoni
    is a notable font, mostly because of its optical sizes... which is exactly the
    sort of refinement ITC is <i>not</i> known for doing, especially not back when
    they were considered trendsetters. &#40;Shudder.&#41; <BR> <BR>ITC bashing is
    done by people of all age groups, as long as they have an eye for good type. On
    the other hand, some people who <i>do</i> have an eye for good type are unable
    to see the ITC fonts of the previous generation as the abominations that they
    are, presumably because they were influentiable youths when that crap was coming
    out. ITC Garamond for example isn&#39;t just dated, it&#39;s a date from hell.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, another very interesting Bodoni is Linotype Gianotten
    - a very scholarly work. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: There&#39;s nothing wrong with ITC type, per se -- it&#39;s just a product
    of its time. Unfortunately for ITC Garamond &#40;and others&#41;, that time happened
    to be the &#39;70s. <BR> <BR>Bodoni on the other hand is one that ITC got right.
    &#40;Or at least, got most recently.&#41; It represents an entirely different
    mindset from the ITC type that most folks bash.  <BR> <BR>Most digital Bodonis
    are nearly illegible at text sizes --  the thicks are too thick and the thins
    vanish. But the 6-point and 12-point versions of ITC Bodoni are both beautiful
    and usable. <BR> <BR>Of course, just like bellbottoms came back into fashion,
    perhaps exaggerated x-heights will become the new black. Only time will tell.

    since they can cause you to trip when walking, like obese x-heights can can cause
    you to trip when reading. In fact, type design has strong parallels to shoemaking.

    href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=97">Filosofia</a>. I rather enjoy the softness
    of the serifs in contrast to the razor-edged versions found in many digital Bodonis
    &#40;although I&#39;ve heard this aspect of Filosofia described by others as &#39;mushiness&#39;&#41;.
    Truthfully, the <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PFilI.html">italic
    OS figures</a> give my the tinglies, and the <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PFilU.html">Unicase</a>
    is one of my favourite stand-alone display faces. Of course, your mileage may
    vary.

    <BR> <BR>While I agree that ITC Bodoni is the strongest and most historically
    accurate Bodoni &#40;and probably the best&#41;, I&#39;d also urge you to at least
    consider Berthold Bodoni Antiqua and Berthold Bodoni Old Face. <BR> <BR>Berthold
    Bodoni Antiqua &amp; Expert: <BR><a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/adobe_lib/080224000.html"

    <BR> <BR>While not as historically accurate or as versatile in optical sizing,
    the Berthold Bodonis are nonetheless also very textworthy. The Old Face designs
    offer a nice alternative to the common Bodonis, and the Old Face Italics are particularly
    beautiful. Bringhurst recommends Berthold Bodoni in The Elements of Typographic
    Style &#40;p. 207&#41; as well as the Bauer Bodoni designs, but this, admittedly,
    was probably before ITC released their cut. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t yet used ITC
    Bodoni, but I&#39;ve had good results with Berthold Bodoni. ITC Bodoni is on my
    wish list, though. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    <BR> <BR>There are two good, two-volume facsimile editions available. One from
    the Holland Press, 1960 &#40;edition of 500&#41;, usually sells for $300 - $400
    US. The more desirable facsimile is the one printed by Mardersteig at the Officina
    Bodoni in Verona, 1968 &#40;edition of 206&#41;, which sells for anywhere from
    $2,000 - $4,000. There is also a third facsimile edition published by Ricci in
    Italy in 1965, but I have never seen it; Ricci is a serious publisher, so it could
    be good. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are other facsimile editions. <BR>
    <BR>To find the price of an original, you would need to check the book auction
    records.

    Had to track it out a bit. Could have done with something in between. <BR> <BR>Prior
    to ITC Bodoni, c. 1990, I had combined Bauer Bodoni for display with Berthold

    <BR>I agree with you that Unicase fonts in families generally tend to be uninspired.
    Just made by combining character forms from the upper and lower case. But that
    was not the case &#40;sorry&#41; with Perla. <BR> <BR>However, the questioning
    of glyph shapes that we are seeing these days is part of the tenor of the times.
    The pendulum swings from eras where type design is considered the making of stylistic
    variations on archetypal forms, to other eras when those forms are questioned.
    <BR> <BR>You have done this kind of experiment yourself - I recall a presentation
    you made at ATypI Boston. I don&#39;t think that it was a Unicase, but it was
    a typeface you had designed with some interesting non-standard glyphs. BTW, was/will
    that be available as a font?'
