body: Can a font have the same name as another registered typeface, if a vendor abbreviation
  or something like that, is applied to the name?

    a Trademark (\u2122) and a registered Trademark (\xAE) typeface name? Can the
    former be used by others?"

  body: "From USPTO.gov:\r\n\r\nWhat is a trademark or service mark?\r\n\r\n    *
    A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases,
    symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods
    of one party from those of others.\r\n    * A service mark is the same as a trademark,
    except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than
    a product. Throughout this booklet, the terms \"trademark\" and \"mark\" refer
    to both trademarks and service marks.\r\n\r\nDo Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents
    protect the same things?\r\n\r\nNo. Trademarks, copyrights and patents all differ.
    A copyright protects an original artistic or literary work; a patent protects
    an invention. For copyright information, go to http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/.
    For patent information, go to http://www.uspto.gov/main/patents.htm.\r\n\r\nIs
    registration of my mark required?\r\nNo. You can establish rights in a mark based
    on legitimate use of the mark. However, owning a federal trademark registration
    on the Principal Register provides several advantages, e.g.,\r\n\r\n    * constructive
    notice to the public of the registrant's claim of ownership of the mark;\r\n    *
    a legal presumption of the registrant's ownership of the mark and the registrant's
    exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with the goods
    and/or services listed in the registration;\r\n    * the ability to bring an action
    concerning the mark in federal court;\r\n    * the use of the U.S registration
    as a basis to obtain registration in foreign countries; and\r\n    * the ability
    to file the U.S. registration with the U.S. Customs Service to prevent importation
    of infringing foreign goods.\r\n\r\nWhen can I use the trademark symbols TM, SM
    and \xAE?\r\n\r\nAny time you claim rights in a mark, you may use the \"TM\" (trademark)
    or \"SM\" (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim, regardless
    of whether you have filed an application with the USPTO. However, you may use
    the federal registration symbol \"\xAE\" only after the USPTO actually registers
    a mark, and not while an application is pending. Also, you may use the registration
    symbol with the mark only on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed
    in the federal trademark registration. "

    And it can only be used in conjunction with a registered trademark.

  body: The TM mark isn't legally meaningless; it's the trademark law equivalent of
    p*ssing on a fire hydrant. It amounts to a generalized statement to the world
    that you are claiming the name as a trademark. If there is a dispute, a registered
    mark is simpler to defend, but both kinds are in principle legally protected.

    whether the unregistered trademark has been used a lot by the holder, so that
    it\xB4s been \"worked in\". And it\xB4s up to the holder to proove it in court."

  body: "Yes, trademarks are maintained by the \"use it or lose it\" model, especially
    when unregistered, or when left unprotected to become part of common parlance.
    Trademark abandonment is something that comes up often in disputes.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Toby, if you have done your due dilligence and found an existing typeface
    using the name you fancy, you should probably \"do the right thing\" and pick
    another name. BUT... If the typeface name in question exists as some kind of dafont.com
    rip-off, you're probably safe to use it for your \"real\" typeface.\r\n\r\nIn
    all things, the golden rule is the best one to follow: Do unto others as you would
    like others to do unto you. So. Would you like someone else to come along and
    use your typeface names for their typefaces?\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents."

  body: "The question of how much diligence is due is moot.\r\n\r\nI had been planning
    to name a typeface \"Austin\", after the 19th century type designer.\r\nI have
    discovered by chance (typecentric surfing serendipity) that Christian Schwartz
    has already named a face Austin, but he has not released it, or, AFAIK, publicized
    it other than on a single web page, and you won't find it by Googling. Also, Berthold
    has the name Austin registered, although they have not released anything by that
    name.\r\n\r\nSo I thought, maybe I can call it Shinn Austin, in the manner of
    Adobe Garamond, Stempel Garamond, ITC Garamond etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, to avoid hassle,
    I'll probably steer clear of Austin. "

    is an immensely talented and prodigious type designer, but the bulk of his work
    has been created bespoke for British clients, including many magazines. Paul has
    recently been working with the equally-talented and -prodigious Christian Schwartz,
    including type systems for <strong>The Guardian</strong> (England), <strong>P\xFAblico</strong>
    (Portugal), and another set of British historical type, \"Brunel\", which was
    commissioned by Cond\xE9-Nast's just-launched <strong>Portfolio</strong> magazine.
    This collaborative work has been more widely covered in both the mainstream and
    design press, for good reason."

    a name that's in the public domain. It's also a name that has a fairly well understood
    meaning with respect to font appearance and style. So naming your font \"Garamond
    Toby\" would be fine, but \"Helvetica Toby\" or \"Interstate Toby\" would not. "
