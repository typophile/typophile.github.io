  text is on a curve... but it should be good enough to identify.  If you cannot suggest
  an exact match then something very similar would be very much appreciated.  I'm
  not a font expert... but it looks like an italic rounded blackletter font with very
  extended and curvy serifs.\r\n\r\nThis comes from the National Bohemian Beer label.\r\n\r\n[[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NESQN7E7J1Q/TkaPc8Mp29I/AAAAAAAABEQ/2DuDbFlN0Vk/s1600/IMG_9446.JPG|See

  the label."

  body: "It's a logo so expect heavy editing.\r\nNot a blackletter, but a Roman face.\r\nThe
    double swash on F is found in Bookmania as an alternate.\r\nBut base font is something
    different. Serifs don't match.\r\nSwash on B is found in Bookmania and several
    others, including Fairfield.\r\nDon\r\n"
