body: "I was pleasantly surprised today when I received a complimentary copy of a
  book called \"Brush 'n' Script Die Schreibschriften sammlung\" published by Verlag
  Hermann Schmidt Mainz. It's a collection of brush scripts by many different type
  designers, some of which I am sure frequent Typophile.com\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how
  many others here have received a copy, or have seen the book.\r\n\r\nIf not, you
  can get a peek at it here:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.brushnscript.de/]]\r\n\r\n--Rob"

  body: "I have been looking forward to this publication, but am pretty disappointed
    by the outcome. The presentational form (1 page per typeface; basic character
    set; A-Z, a-z, figures) is not suited for script fonts with their complex nature.
    Furthermore, the selection of typefaces is debatable, to say the least. That does
    not mean that there are no good ones in it, the book contains a number of gems,
    including some of Rob\u2019s and other typophiles\u2019."
