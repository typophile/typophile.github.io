  advise me on a few questions... <BR> <BR>Do you think that a flash based Typesampler
  is an important way to test a font before you buy? <BR> <BR>We are also offering
  desigenrs who sell through us 50% of the sale price, does this seem reasonable compared

    would expect a <i>lot</i> of active marketing from anyone taking 50%, and not
    just marketing of their own services: marketing of individual typefaces and foundries.
    In &#39;this hyper-competitive type design scene&#39;, the days when vendors could
    collect a substantial percentage just for reselling a font is over. Frankly, I
    wouldn&#39;t be inclined to let any reseller take more than 40%, and I would want
    to see copies of every marketing piece they produced to make sure that they were
    doing a good job and not just using my typeface to pad their library. There are
    a lot of font resellers now, and the Internet has largely levelled the playing
    field: foundries and individual designers can afford to be picky and demand that
    the resellers be competetive.'

  body: The disadvantage of running your own e-commerce site is running your own e-commerce
    site. <BR> <BR>The advatages are that you only need to sell half as much if  50%
    is your discount level. Also you get paid quicker, know how much you are making
    as you make it. You get to know your clientel. And they are your clientel. Also
    you have a chance to actually sell something rather than let someone merely order
    from the order desk of a large impersonal vendor. <BR> <BR>Also I have found the
    customer can often add valuable input to your products, market changes etc. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>As someone who once licensed fonts for sale by one of the most prestigious
    names in 100&#43; years of type, and who was soon counting down the days -- along
    with numerous colleagues -- until the contract expired and I could stop these
    inept parasites devaluing my work, I have long since realised that the &#39;little
    foundries&#39; have a much higher prestige among serious customers than any reseller.
    You want prestige? Buy your fonts directly from the people who make them. What
    resellers like MyFonts, Union, etc. offer is not prestige but convenience. <BR>
    <BR>I greatly admire the way Jeremy Tankard handles resellers: he offers them
    a small percentage &#40;usually less than 20%&#41; and he demands results. If
    they don&#39;t adequately market his fonts, he reduces the percentage. If they
    don&#39;t sell enough, he cancels the contract. How can he do this? Because his
    &#39;little foundry&#39; has established a prestigious reputation through the
    quality of his work and very active marketing.'

    is the principal of the firm. As to cost, I&#39;d rather not say, since it was
    his firm&#39;s first shot at writing the database and shopping cart software,
    and it took a long time &#40;which gave me more time to fine tune fonts&#41; and
    he gave me a big break on the cost since I wasn&#39;t demanding it be finished
    by a certain time. <BR> <BR>He is more expensive now. <BR> <BR>Chris and I have
    since become good friends and having adcSTUDIO manage and work the site has been
    a great experience. I guess that is why I see no disadvantage to having an e-commerce
    site. <BR> <BR>I have been fortunate to have made some good friends with principals
    of other small businesses as we have entered into business relationships.

  body: 50% royalties seem reasonable.  For that number a designer such as myself
    would want lots of marketing going out, especially printed. <BR> <BR>Lay out all
    of the type showings the same way, like font bureau. If you want to show the font
    in use, design posters or other material to show them off on the site. Or even
    collect samples of the type in use and put those up there. <BR> <BR>PDF showings
    are a nice feature to have. <BR> <BR>Flash typesetters are cool, but I don&#39;t
    use them much. <BR> <BR>Definitely go for quality fonts over quantity. A good
    selection of average fonts will bring some people to the site. Unique designs
    will draw more traffic and sell better in the long run. <BR> <BR>The bonus incentive
    is very appealing.  I&#39;m considering submitting fonts to the Bitstream New
    Font Collection, they give you the option for $2000 immediately or a royalty plan.
    That&#39;s a nice way to make a quick 2 Gs.

  body: 'From the perspective of a purchaser/ user, rather than creator, of fonts,
    I have a few general &#39;shopping experience&#39; preferences and pet peeves:
    <BR> <BR>- Printable samples &#40;PDFs&#41;: The impact of printed samples, showing
    the font actually in use &#40;along with blown up, with ligatures, etc.&#41; is
    much greater for convincing the people who provide the $$ &#40;client and/or me&#41;.
    Like Randy, I find this is particularly true of text faces. <BR> <BR>- Flash preview
    sampler: For logotypes, I really like having this kind of tool available. It definitely
    helps my purchasing decisions. And while I understand that some people screenshot
    the type without paying, making it harder to do that by using weird patterns &#40;as
    Hoefler does&#41;, or not offering the feature at all isn&#39;t going to get them
    to buy your fonts anyway. Plus, you can zoom in with Flash and see the juicy little
    details. <BR> <BR>- On-screen samples: Images of type in use, even if it&#39;s
    short strings of words, like FB does. I find these much more telling than &#34;Meta
    Book Roman&#34; set in Meta Book Roman, or a character chart &#40;not that I don&#39;t
    want to see one of those as well&#41;. For quick browsing, &#40;like you have
    on your site&#41; I don&#39;t mind, but I like having them available to look more
    thoroughly. <BR> <BR>- Please don&#39;t hide the price: I don&#39;t mean put it
    on the first page per se, but don&#39;t make it tedious to access. I understand
    that there are different prices for different situations, but a single-user license
    price gives a good sense of price scale. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been to the current
    Union Fonts site, so I know that a lot of this isn&#39;t news to you, and that
    some of these features are already in place. Consider this my plea on their behalf.
    I look forward to seeing what you guys do.'

  body: <i>&#62;Font Bureau, at $40 per weight, is nearly double the $21 of many at
    MyFonts.</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, Font Bureau fonts are a little more costly than the
    average these days; I personally believe you get appropriate value for the additional
    cost. <BR> <BR>I would like to point out that the FB pricing structure is volume-based.
    The $40 price so often cited is only if you buy only one or two styles at a time.
    When you buy three styles, the per font price goes down to $35. If you purchase
    six or more, the price drops further to $30 each. These are the most significant
    break points; there are others as you increase the volume further.  <BR> <BR>This
    is, unfortunately, not immediately apparent from their website. To see the structure
    spelled out more clearly, go to <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com" target="_blank">
    www.fontbureau.com</a> and click on the little Help icon in the lower right hand
    corner of the front page. From the new Help window, select the topic &#34;Font
    Pricing&#34; from the list on the right. <BR> <BR>So, when it comes to buying
    a family of FB fonts &#40;which is really the better way to go about it&#41; the
    price quickly comes down to a more reasonable territory -- never cheap, I admit,
    but reasonable. <BR> <BR>Note that these volumes apply regardless of whether the
    fonts are in the same family or not -- a unique circumstance, as far as I know.
    So you can buy just a handful of styles of Miller, for instance, and maybe a few
    weights of Interstate, and throw in Mantinia, and put together your own package
    for $30 each. That&#39;s not too bad, when you think about it. &#40;Well, when
    &#42;I&#42; think about it, anyway.&#41; <BR> <BR>Just felt compelled to clarify.
