body: I am still looking at book covers trying to find a font that will suit a novel
  I am doing set in Bombay in the 1970s and 1980s. Does anyone know this one or can
  think or any others that would suit? I don&#39;t want something too &#34;paisley&#34;
  but it&#39;s got to have some character. Thank you! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6470.jpg"

  body: D&#39;oh! <BR> <BR>Here I am, after a good night&#39;s rest, just arrived
    at work, checking the Typophile boards &#40;hi everyone, did you miss me? ;&#41;
    &#41; and what do I find? <i>Hrant pulled a <b>one minute Type ID</b> on us!</i>
    Broke all the records! Just like that, without a warning! <BR> <BR>So there he
    was, hiding in the undergrowth like an Armenian tiger &#40;do they make those?&#41;,
    biding his time, flexing his muscle, eyes squinting, and... SWOOOOSH! All our
    efforts for naught. <BR> <BR>Brilliant, Hrant. I&#39;m <strike>waffled</strike>
    baffled. <BR> <BR>PS MORE DALLIANCE!

  body: 'Well, maybe not tigers, but we do have mountain lions. But my secret was
    that I had you two covered there. For you, I made sure to go nocturnal. For Stephen,
    there&#39;s only one way: toiletcam. <BR> <BR>BTW, there should still be room
    for a zero-minuter. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>As for Miriam&#39;s related question:
    <BR>I think Dalliance is actually an interesting choice for this topic. A less
    subtle choice might be something like ITC Simran. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
