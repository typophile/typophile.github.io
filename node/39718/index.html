  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>As a project for my BA degree in graphic design we have been set to take on one of this years d&amp;ad briefs. The one I have chosen is set by Research Studios and is to relauch Fuse Magazine and its 20th issue.</p>
<p><code>The brief
Re-launch FUSE magazine by designing its 20th issue.
Mandatory requirements
FUSE was seen as a revolution in both typography and the format it chose for publication. This re-launch should further this FUSE heritage.
Throughout your concept and design you must feature a new, original font created specially for this issue. Your final presentation must include:
• Format and examples of layout
• Complete font display
• Promotional poster for the re-launch
• Anything else you think is relevant
</code></p>
<p>It can be read in full here: <a href="http://www.dandad.org/studentawards08/briefs/pdf/GRAPHIC_RESEARCHSTUDIOS.pdf">http://www.dandad.org/studentawards08/briefs/pdf/GRAPHIC_RESEARCHSTUDIOS.pdf</a></p>
<p>Research for this project has been fairly hard as I have not yet been able to even view a copy of Fuse Magazine.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can get hold of on? I am located in the United Kingdom. If not, any additional information would be appreciated. Or if someone has a copy at home a few scans would be great.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Gustaf</p>

<p>Many themes that I have thought about has come back to some type of geometics etc.. although I would like some theme that is just something completely different. An earlier competition set by Research Studios was &ldquo;Security&rdquo; which I thought was a pretty good one.</p>
<p>The themes that I have thought of sort of feels pretty pointless so far, <strong>anyone got any ideas for a good theme?</strong></p>
<p>Could be pretty much anything! Whatever you can think of, write it down!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah, I pretty much would just like to see on what level what I have written down so far compares.</p>
<p>A war theme is something that has been poping around in my head for a while today. Could be a good way to go ahead considering the uk&rsquo;s participation in the iraq war etc.. Its a way I think could have been handled a bit differently, if that is even possible for someone who has not been there to say, at least from what has been displayed in media here, also considering the different things that the media has reported in this country and some of the issues that has been completely disregarded (Media from other countries has aired some other stories which seems to have been blacklisted here).</p>
<p>As It might end up as a pictogram typeface, the items of war and geometrics would work nicely together.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If anyone knows what typeface was used for the FUSE logo, that information would be appreciated. I have used this image to check in What-Is-The-Font etc as well but without any good matches.
