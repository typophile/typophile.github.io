body: first off, i wish to create the fonts for flash. and it&#39;s my first time
  making pixel fonts. <BR> <BR>probably someone will direct me to the tutorial on
  ultrashock - well i&#39;ve seen that and followed it as best i can. <A HREF="http://www.ultrashock.com/tutorials/flash5/fonttutorial.html"
  TARGET="_top">http://www.ultrashock.com/tutorials/flash5/fonttutorial.html</A> <BR>
  <BR>however i think it all goes wrong at 10. &#39;open the bitmap, and make sure
  it looks the same as the outline&#39; <BR> <BR>well it does not match up i can see
  the blacked boxes i have just drawn and also an outline, which i assume it the bitmap
  outline, and it does not mention how to solve the problem. <BR> <BR>can anyone help
  me out with this <BR> <BR>thanks

  body: ' try skipping that step.  see if it works anyway. <BR> <BR>also I would avoid
    making flash fonts in 10pt increments - there&#39;s a bug in flash &#40;up to
    and including MX, I believe&#41; that will blur 10pt. bitmap fonts when used in
    dynamic text fields <BR> <BR>instead design for 8pt increments &#40;800 em square
    instead of 1000 em... step 6 in that tutorial, then recalc to 8 instead of 10
    - step 9&#41; <BR> <BR>hope that helps, good luck '
