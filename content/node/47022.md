  body: "<cite>What a lovely, clever, new and useful (I hope) design!</cite>\r\n\r\nI'd
    be curious to see how useful this design becomes to graphic designers. The comment
    I hear most from my GD and AD colleagues is that many new type designs are so
    full of personality, they don't allow the designer to instill their personality
    in the work they are doing. So they don't use them."

  body: "In this day and age, I don't see why a typeface needs to have very broad
    usage to be worthwhile. In past times, when type used to be expensive and dependent
    on availability, it made sense for a typesetter to carry fonts that could go the
    distance. Today, fonts are quite cheap and very easily available. designers and
    art directors still have loads of faces to choose from with minimal personality--far
    MORE than they EVER did. There surely is room for more vertical market type in
    our quick-turnaround world. I rather like the new face and applaud his efforts
    for pushing the boundaries a bit. Nobody is saying this is a book face or a newspaper
    face but I can see ad copy and some magazine pull-quotes done in it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Very interesting point, Chris. \r\n\r\nBecause of the low cost of type, I
    think what has happened is that graphic designers are using very expressive and
    sometimes extreme type where in the old metal era they would have used hand lettering.
    \r\n\r\nSo there is now a place for faces like this, which there wouldn't have
    been in the old days. Or to put it another way, because there is nothing like
    this, it has a place!"

  body: "Jackie, by \"low cost\" I meant compared to the metal days, pre-1960s. Not
    really low cost in relation to other type faces. \r\n\r\nThe lower cost of type
    in this sense I gather came in with the photo type you are referring to. And \"low\"
    really now means in comparison to what it would cost to hire a letterer to do
    the same job. I don't know the going rates, but I am guessing that if you reuse
    the type at all, it would be cheaper than hiring a letterer.  "

    Alphatype - every font was $30 and if it was a royalty font (ITC, BQ, TSI, etc.)
    it was an additional $30. So 4 weights with 4 counterparts = 240 plus 240 in royalties
    - $480 bucks. \r\n\r\nAnd I felt horrible when I bought Illustrator years ago
    - and they \"gaveaway\" full families... no extra cost. \r\n\r\nWilliam - I may
    have a warped sense of humor - I was wondering if someone today had a typeshop
    - where would they catagorize the font? After all, every shop must be organized
    to get through the day... :-)"

    the cost of living and wages of those days as well. Minimum wage was one dollar
    per hour and $480 would have been about a months pay for the average worker. New
    cars cost $2000 and a single family house was about $15,000. Oh, and gasoline
    was about 25 cents a gallon.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
