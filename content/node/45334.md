body: Hi guys, I need some genuine and honest comment about my logo design for a yoghurt
  treat store. The meaning behind the logo (yogo) is a combination of yoghurt and
  go, my target audience is on-the-go consumer.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comment_6737.jpg]

  body: It's nice. I prefer the top version without the little white accents. Nice
    color choice. Fonts choice has a nice friendly feel too.

  body: Looks great, you're definitely on the right track! The white accents are distracting
    and too small to convey significance, so the top one is the best choice. It is
    excellent, however, I'm looking at it (purely subjective) as a conflict between
    good and evil (devil horns vs angel wings). The colours work, but what if the
    swirls are more pronounced?

    the southeast corner of the swirl so it doesn't look so heavy.\r\n\r\nAlso, FYI:

  body: I made some changes again with my logotype, here's a picture showing the changes
    that I have made. I kind of made the swirls blunder and discard the swirl on the
    letter 'g'. I also experiment using the typeface Candice and modified it for the
    letter 'y' and 'g', I am not sure if it works better with the typeface Candice
    or stick back with the original logotype. Hope to receive more comments from all
    of you. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f_6217.jpg]

    'g' on the top on has that feel of yoghurt coming out of a dispenser.

    instead it would be perfect.\r\n\r\nThe reason I like it is the tips of the yoghurt
    seem softer and more real. They needed to be exaggerated. I'm glad you did that."

  body: Special thanks to Miss Tiffany for suggesting the use of Omnes typeface on
    my logotype, it really does work. I replaced the letter 'g' with the Omnes typeface
    and the curve on the top of the letter 'g' seems to look and curve better. I also
    used the Omnes typeface for the phrase below logo to give a bolder and creamier
    look to the whole logotype. Thanks for all the comments again guys.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/l_5592.jpg]

  body: "IMHO the logo looks a bit \"fat\" instead of \"fat-free\". In the current
    state it says \"yoghurt\", but (again, to me) it doesn't says \"fat-free\". It
    looks like a tasty, sensual,  delightful, joyful yoghurt, and we all connect these
    things with fat (you know that foods tastes better to westerns because of the
    fat). Fat-free on the other hand is more like following a strict diet, have some
    discipline, etc. I like the word game, colors, evrythng, I just think that the
    sans-serif font fits more into the brand.\r\nFinaly, how about using Oldstyle
    figures for numbers?"

  body: "The idea that something is skinny, for me, equals diet which in turn equals
    blech! On the otherhand if it is full-fat we know it must be good. So I'm thinking
    it is ok to use a bolder typeface for something that is natural and not skinny.
    No?\r\n\r\nI liked how the tails on the y and g matched before. And the counter
    of the Omnes g is changed a bit. But, you could take a cue from that shape for
    the o (s) as in a way they are like you drew them with yogurt. No?"

    other one holds 2 cups. They both can be folded from just a single piece of card
    without using any glue. The reusable carriers will encourage consumers to reuse
    the carrier to earn stamps. When they have earned enough stamps, they can redeem
    a cup of frozen yoghurt from the store.\r\n\r\nThe reusable theme is also applied
    to the paper carrier bag.\r\n\r\n"
