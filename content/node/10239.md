  body: 'Not perfect, but I think this will do: <BR> <BR>&#34;Dear Fred Nader,  <BR>I
    do not believe you when you say you have digitized the Guyot &#40;published under
    the name Day Roman&#41;. I am sorry to say that in spite of the differences between
    you and many others in the international typographical scene, you continue to
    use the shapes of other type designers and distribute/publish their designs under
    your own name. The Devroye family &#40;0182&#41; is a pure copy and manipulation
    of Fran'

  body: Ramiro, this text was taken from JFP&#39;s comment in response   <BR>to Fred
    Nader&#39;s comment at <a href="http://typographi.ca/000511.php" target="_blank">Typographica</a>.
    &#40;You&#39;ll have to wade   <BR>through a lot on the page to find it.&#41;
    Sorry I didn&#39;t get to    <BR>your question sooner so koeiekat woun&#39;t have
    to translate.    <BR>The kat did a fine job, though!

  body: Thanks Stephen. I have a more complete perspective now. <BR> <BR>BTW, I think
    someone removed the original Devroye font &#40;0182&#41; from The Lab &#40;<a
    href="http://www.hardcovermedia.com/lab/Pages/Fontpages/dayroman.html" target="_blank">http://www.hardcovermedia.com/lab/Pages/Fontpages/dayroman.html</a>&#41;.
    This is not &#34;Devroye&#34; font...

  body: 'Dear Ale: very frecuently I hear comments on piracy and related topics. <BR>IMHO,
    it&#39;s more interesting to debate this issues openly. I don&#39;t see any reason
    to not talk about this things in a open forum. '
