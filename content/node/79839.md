body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nDue to an impending move, I must part with a case of metal type.
  I acquired this for no charge and will be passing it along for the same price. The
  font sizes are 8 - 14 pts. I do not know what font or fonts are in the case, (perhaps
  someone can identify from the photo's) and much of the type is unsorted.\r\n\r\n<img

  will be by pick-up only, so if you're in the Toronto Canada area, or plan to be,
  and are interested in acquiring some gorgeous metal type, please contact me via
  email: vfullard at rogers.com \r\n(obviously you would replace the word \"at\" with
  the @ sign and remove the spaces).\r\n\r\nPlease save this type from extinction!"

    love to see some more photos and when you might be looking to have it moved out.\r\n\r\nYork
    might also be interested in it, though I am sure you'll find a few takers."

    pretty sure it's going to be a "D'oh" moment.

  body: "Thanks Val,\r\n\r\nVery good timing that I was going to be in Toronto helping
    Brain move some other type to another good home (A long day of type moving).\r\n\r\nThe
    font in the foreground of the photo is 30pt Kennerly. There was also some Bembo
    (Italic and small caps) in the cases. \r\n\r\nMuch thanks again!\r\nIf anyone
    is traveling through Buffalo and wants to see our printshop and collection of
    wood and metal type, just give a yell."
