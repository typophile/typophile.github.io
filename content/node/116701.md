body: "Hi! \r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the Font Family Futura - in particular
  the font Futura XBlkCn BT. \r\n\r\nTo be more precise I want to know if this font
  is allowed to use in Logos etc.? \r\n\r\nI am literally searching the hell out of
  google to find a proper answer for this, unfortunately not with a satisfying answer.
  What I found out until now is that the font family from futura is not per definition
  protected for any use in a logo or a corporate identity. According to my research
  futura itself is \"public domain\", which means (at least in my understanding) that
  this font should be free for corporate use or did I understood that wrong? \r\n\r\nActually
  I am a bit concerned since a friend of mine informed me that the brand \"Absolut
  - Vodka\" is using a similar font for their corp-identity.....\r\n\r\nSince I am
  not that deep familiar with the copyright in terms of fonts I would really appreciate
  any feedback, links for copyright terms for fonts, etc from you guys. :-) \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your answers. \r\n\r\nCheers! "

  body: "Hi R4773,\r\nyou asked me to move this thread to the Release forum, but I
    think that General Discussions actually is the more appropriate place. I have
    removed the link you posted, because that site offers pirated fonts for download."

  body: It is true that Absolut uses a variant of Futura for their corporate identity
    and advertising, but it has been modified quite a bit which gives it a unique
    look. It is proprietary to Absolut; using Futura for yourself should pose no problems.

  body: "Guys, thanks so much for this quick and AWESOME feedback! :-)\r\nThat really
    helps! \r\n\r\nI guess I learned in 8mins reading here more than in 8 hours research
    in google... ;-) \r\nThrough the feedback from you guys I decided to change the
    plan's for the issue I had to deal with and I now used 2 different google fonts
    for creating the mentioned coorp identity. \r\n\r\nGuess I won't have to deal
    with similar copyright issues, due their Open Source model - LIKE! ..... ;-) \r\n\r\n@Florian
    - Thank you for the support and sry for the link, I wasn't aware that this site
    is one of the bad ones will be more carefull next time...\r\n\r\n"
