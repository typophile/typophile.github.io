    newspaper font"</a> should maybe be called <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/swift_std_regular/?sample_text=rose%20shrubs%20high%20over%20grass">Swift</a>

  body: You are right about that. In the time he started to design the typeface he
    admired Gerard Unger and his work and visited Unger at his home to talk about
    typedesign.

  body: Beautiful site, simple clean type, incredible photos. I can see the "Unger
    Effect" very rigid and balanced but still feels organic. I think i'm most intrigued
    by his 3D applications of type, very forward. What city does he work out of Pieter?-ONE
