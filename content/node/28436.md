  control Adobe applications, particularly InDesign? I make lots of catalogues based
  on excel sheets, and I want to automate the formatting and image placement. Would
  Python be the best thing for the job? Apparently these guys do it, but to what extent
  and for what purpose I can't fathom. http://www.pragma2000.com/index_eng.shtml Any
  thoughts would be welcome."
