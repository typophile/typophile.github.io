    has unicase alternates, but the a that doubles (rotated) as a g appears to be

  body: "Diane DiPiazza's TheComedians with width reduced to 70% and _O_ corrected
    by using the inner stroke from _Q_. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheComediansW70pctSM_6312.jpg]
    Fairly close.\r\nI see no problem with personal use -- these were original free
    fonts.\r\nAs for commercial, usual questions.\r\nDon"
