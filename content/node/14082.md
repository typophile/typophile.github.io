  font creation.  I am interested in creating my own type and I don't know where to
  begin.  I use a Mac and I would like to know what programs are out there.  If this
  can't be answered here, is there a link to a place that does?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLouis"

  body: "I am a bit of a newbie here myself, so take this with a pinch of salt. \r\n\r\nTopics
    regarding software tools are usually found in \"Build\". Most topics concentrate
    on technical aspects of software, rather than on how to design or use type as
    such.\r\n\r\nThere are some topics about type design in \"Design\", covering things
    like how to make a good 's', or how to create italics.\r\n\r\nYou will also find
    useful advice in the various subsections in \"Critique\". This is the place to
    post samples of your designs for others to comment on. Reading comments from experts
    about other people's designs might help you gain insight into some of the important
    aspects of designing type.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Have fun!"

    that I <em>still</em> haven't released anything, but I've got a lot more cool

  body: "Yes. I'm to blame for some of the confusion, I suppose. If you need critiquing
    it is obvious, but otherwise it is confusing. \r\n\r\nAnything about your personal
    work usually belongs in CRITIQUE or DESIGN. DESIGN if you are just showing. CRITIQUE
    if you want opinions. BUILD if it is tech of some kind. RELEASE if it is for suggestions
    on how to release your designs (type or otherwise). If you want type suggestions,
    DESIGN. If you are are trying to find a face, TYPE ID.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I'm the
    one of the persons whom move your threads."
