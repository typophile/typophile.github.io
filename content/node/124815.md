  body: The only one who could give you "the exact and precise font" is probably the
    manifacturer that machine-engraved the piece in the seventies/eighties (http://www.marklev.com/2014/05/ml-1-preamplifier.html).
    But it would almost certainly be a custom typeface for engraving machines, in
    a proprietary format and with no direct relation with any digital font for personal
    computers.

  body: "faithhiend, I'm very sorry nobody has identified it. I still think it's a
    custom job and has never been a digital font. Almost one week here and still no
    positive identification and unsolved at [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/245562|WhatTheFont
    Forum]] too... I think it'd be not so hazardous to definitely consider it as a
    custom logo work (meaning not a font). \r\nNow depending on what you need, you
    have 3 options to reproduce this lettering:\r\n- vector logo freely available
    to download [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/logo?search_api_views_fulltext=levinson|here]]\r\n-
    redo it from scratch which not be very long as it's monolined and quite geometric/symmetric/squared
    (starting with the [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/245562|previous
    sample]] I linked to)\r\n- adapt one of my previous suggestions (I'd probably
    start with <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/arkitech.font|Arkitech]] Light</strong>)"
