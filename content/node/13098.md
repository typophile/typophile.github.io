  body: "To my semi-amateur eye:\r\nm - the left half looks wider than the right one\r\nt
    - the ascender seems too high\r\ng - looks good but probably falls out from the
    general context\r\n7 - falls to the left\r\nAlso I doubt about some width in the
    UC, for example, such wide G.\r\nSpeaking about the overall style, I like it pretty
    much."

  body: 'The first thing I see: you have less space between the link of the g and
    the eye in the regular weight than the light. I think you need to open up the
    space on the regular to be have a consistent look. '

    was longer. Same comment  for the diagonale line of the R.\r\n\r\nExcellent work"
