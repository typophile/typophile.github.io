body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMy client is a job agency called \"TimeZeit\", a combination of
  the English \"time\" and its German equivalent \"Zeit\". The client wants a slick
  solution that appeals to job seekers and corporate clients equally, and that will
  stand the test of \"time\" (joke).\r\n\r\nHowever, I am finding it very difficult
  to come up with any ideas. Incorporating a clock in the logo seems obvious, however
  having the concept of time appear three times in the logo may be too flamboyant.\r\n\r\nSince
  the business is essentially a people business, I also tried variations that had
  humans in it, for example humans forming a circle (= clock!), seen from above -
  with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest idea I came up with and
  that I would like your opinion on:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_B_4300.png]\r\n\r\nThese
  would be some other concepts:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_4196.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6203.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help in this matter!"

    between the 'ti' and 'it'.\r\n\r\nBeside that...\r\n\r\nIt is very minimalistic.\r\nBut
    you said it is a people business. I always find these concepts are to distant
    from people. It is clean and I do not get a warm, fuzzy feel. It does not attract
    me!\r\n\r\nInteresting what you have done with the 'ti' and 'it'.\r\nBut it isn't
    for a church. The cross is to apparent.\r\n\r\nIt could also be a wordmark for
    a newspaper. But perhaps I'm seeing that because I am redesigning a newspaper.

    variants.\r\n;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Is it the 'clocking on/clocking off' type of worker - people that work by the
    hour? If so perhaps something with undertones of speed and agility may be more
    apt, ie. your company has the workers that gets the task done quickly and efficiently.
    Is it targeting any particular industry?\r\n\r\nIts hard to say without knowing
    a bit more about the company, but the options above aren't really jumping out
    at me."

  body: "I happen to quite like the new one Tin. I am a fan of simple typographic
    solutions, that said, I feel the name is flawed - as previously discussed in the
    other thread. So I would avoid any visual reference to time or clocks. I feel
    the last one (on the bottom) with the people in the circle is a bit overdone and
    confusing. I would incorporate \"RECRUITMENT AGENCY\" or the German equivalent
    into the logo and get done with it because this ain't getting any better with
    a name like that :)\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nJay"

  body: "Hi and thanks for your comments so far.\r\n\r\nAnd apologies for starting
    a new thread. The previous one was simply getting too embarrassing...\r\n\r\nIn
    essence, the job agency provides bulk job ads to corporate clients of all kinds.
    They are not targeting any particular industry. Nor are they dealing with job
    seekers in any way (my initial post was a little misleading here).\r\n\r\nThis
    would be an earlier concept of ours:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6088.png]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I couldn't find a way to tie the people to the wordmark in any useful manner.
    I also feel like the concept of people in a logo is a bit worn out, especially
    in a job agency. What do you think? Which logo has got the most potential?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: "<cite>Which logo has got the most potential?</cite>\r\n\r\nDefinately the
    first one. Number two, as you said, is too much like a watchmaker and sorry but
    i hate number 3 - far too fussy. You are right to avoid people - too cliched.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, if someone at my work was on this project I'd advise them to do further
    explorations. What would it look like with really tight tracking - like the Wolf
    Olins' Booz&co work?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bac-booz_and_co-logo_3436.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nIs
    it supposed to be two words or one? Might be interesting to treat it as one, how
    would it be pronounced? If you wanted a subtle tilt at 'people' you could look
    at something with the i's representing a person - relationship with the t representing
    a relevant concept. The symmetry is nice but as bobby said, take care not to look
    like a church. Maybe the 'me', as in personal, could be emphasized? Does 'ze'
    mean anything in German?\r\n\r\nCould also look at a far subtler nod to 'time'...dunno,
    something like the letters casting a shadow starting long and going to short representing
    the passing of time without alluding to clocks. Might be too fussy. Tracking from
    loose to very tight in the middle to loose again - acceleration?\r\n\r\nJust some
    random thoughts anyway, take them for what they are. We would get all this sort
    of stuff up on a wall and start exploring.\r\n\r\nI would avoid having 'recruitment
    agency' as part of the name or mark - its redundant and dull.\r\n\r\nps. that
    thing with the clip art in your last post is just awful."
