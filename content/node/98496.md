  it's a rather small image, tried running the HAIR sample through WhatTheFont with

  body: Sorry, don't know this type. Could be an exclusive bespoke typeface, not so
    unsual when speaking of fashion industry magazines. I've found a bigger sample
    [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaizfeng/6961661964/|here]] though. It reminds
    me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/THROHAND/|Throhand]], may be a custom work
    based on this one. Funny thing is some letters (/S, /N, /X) look to have been
    horizontally mirrored.

    body: Thank you, Throhand Pen is similar enough. Yeah the mirrored letters are
      an odd feature, but I do prefer the 'originals', thank you!
