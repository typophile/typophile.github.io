  I'm useless with type, having no natural nack for it and no training. \r\n\r\nI'd
  really appreciate some suggestions for fonts I could use in the banners.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSam"

  body: Maybe you could tell us a bit about your client, and what the label is for.
    You can't design in a vacuum. What are you trying to communicate? The solution
    sometimes lies within the problem that needs to be solved, but first you must
    put the problem into words.

  body: "The product is fig jam, made from an old Albanian recipe. The client is looking
    for something that communicates that home madeness of it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure
    there is a problem really...I'm just looking for a font that gives off a home
    made feel...sorry I can't be more specific. Maybe if anyone has any direct questions
    I might be able to be of more help!"

  body: Will the picture/label you posted used as it is? If so, why not hand-draw
    the type to match the overall feel?

  body: "I would go further and suggest that drawing the letters by hand to match
    the rest of the design is probably the only way to go. Of course, you can base
    the letters on existing type, but I'd say that having the proper hand-lettered
    look is even more important than the form of the letters.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't
    confident about lettering, I'd say pick a typeface and draw it on the banners
    by hand the way you drew the rest of the design. Don't fret if you can't duplicate
    the type perfectly, since you are going for the home-made feel anyway."
