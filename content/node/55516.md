  like this, but I just remembered that I once saw a specimen PDF somewhere which
  included a poster-like sheet with the quote \xBBReality is inside the skull.\xAB
  Unfortunately, I cannot recall the name of the typeface or its creator.\r\n\r\nCan
  you help me out?\r\nThank you in advance!"

  body: I used that quote a few years ago. In the specimen for a woodtype revival
    I did called Origo.
