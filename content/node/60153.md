  to find in the web the Letraset and Mecanorma catalogues to identify some them but
  could not get information.\r\n\r\nI have three samples, The first uses a type used
  by the legendary Wim Crouwel in 1963.\r\n\r\nThanks. I will credit with pleasure
  the name of person who helped find it, of course."

    '67 and Oldenburg\"68. \r\n\r\nI imagine Juan Diego Consuegra, the son, could
    be contacted through the Allworth Press. He wants to update American Type, Design
    & Designers.\r\n\r\nMichael"
