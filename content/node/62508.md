    me, even if they have alternate characters. I bought a font just yesterday with
    about 1500 characters, including lots of alternates, but it didn't have this,
    even though some of my fonts do.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "I guess I haven't looked through all my fonts to see how common this feature
    is. From what I remember it is not that difficult to achieve, so it seems like
    most fonts should have this feature. For an end user it must be extremely frustrating
    to have to search through the palette to find your options.\r\n\r\nmw"

  body: I think it depends on whether the particular font you're using has opentype
    substitution routines built in. For example if a font has onum (oldstyle numerals)
    as a substitution for lnum (lining) then the onum and lnum classes would be alternates
    of each other.

  body: "I'm sorry, I guess I didn't make it clear that it is for a typeface that
    I have designed. I am trying to find the coding used in FontLab so that the end
    user can access the alternative glyphs in there layout program. The font currently
    uses Nick Shinn's Pseudo-random 3.0 script and I have the glyphs in there corresponding
    classes. If I am remembering correctly it's not an OpenType script that was run,
    but it is somehow done through the classes.\r\n\r\nmw"

  body: "OK, so I went through Jens link and the aalt feature works for the most part.
    The font I am working on has four variations for every glyph. When I try to access
    them through an application the first three \"A\" glyphs show me all four variations,
    but the fourth only shows me three (one of them being itself). It is always the
    default glyph that is not shown, and this happens throughout the entire font not
    just the \"A\" glyph.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nmw"

    This adds the fourth variation to the submenu for A.3, but it makes A, A.1, A.2
    show itself twice in their submenu giving the user a false fifth variation.\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface I am working on has 383 glyphs with four variations for every character,
    which means I would have to write that code 383 times. The 'aalt' feature from
    the test font (Minion Pro) in Adobes FDK just shows a list of its OT features.\r\n\r\nmw\r\n"

  body: "You wouldn't have to write it 383 times. You could just include (with the
    appropriate class definitions):\r\n\r\n<code> sub @Variant4 by @Base; </code>\r\n\r\nThe
    'aalt' feature is the one feature which can include other features, in which case
    all of the substitutions performed by that feature are included in 'aalt'.\r\n\r\nThe
    results you are getting would seem to indicate that the way in which your features
    are set up involves multiple different pathways by which some of the glyphs can
    be mapped to the others. If you can't get the desired results by listing your
    features, you might want to instead not include those features and just include
    individual substitution statements like the one above.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, though,
    I haven't experimented with this technique so I can't give any guarantees. I usually
    just let FontLab create the 'aalt' feature for me."
