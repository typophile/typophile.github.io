  body: "If I may differ with Jan's ID, the MADNESS sample looks a lot more like some
    Courier than American Typewriter to me (no spur on the \"G\", left-side top serif
    on the \"A\", overall smaller serifs). <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/courier-10-pitch/\">Bitstream's
    Courier 10 Pitch</a> looks close. \r\nThe font in the sample is bolder than that;
    I'd guess it has been outlined, and/or blurred somewhat in the printing process."
