    Juices, Nutritional Info, About Ribena etc.

  body: "At first glance I thought it WAS Gizmo. Somebody has obviously taken Gizmo
    and completely reworked it. There are certain characteristics of this font that
    are the same as Gizmo. It is has been altered enough to be a different typeface,
    but basically, it is my handwriting - altered.\r\n\r\nIt is too coincidentally
    close to Gizmo to be the handwriting of somebody else. And with a similar pen.\r\n\r\nI
    am NOT AT ALL HAPPY about this. I will get to the bottom of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick
    Cooke\r\n\r\nPs I am used to seeing slight alterations, (mainly the lower case
    r), but this takes it to a different level."
