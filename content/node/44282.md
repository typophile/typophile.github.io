  body: I have a Mac Plus that I can boot in either 3.2 or 6.0.8 - not sure if I can
    get screen shots into another machine right now, though, because I don't have
    the networking cables for it and my only other floppy drive is having some issues.
    I could give it a try, though.

    I can tell which glyph goes in what space.

  body: It doesn't look like I can do actual screen grabs, but I can take some photos
    of the screen showing the positions of the glyphs if that will work. The glyphs
    are too big for the boxes in Key Caps - is that OK for a general idea of the positions
    or would it be better to type them into MacWrite or something?

    going to try to sue me.\r\n\r\nShe never got back to me though as I'm sure she's
    super busy. I'm going to email her again when the website is finished. There's
    going to be a bit about her and the guy who designed Kid Pix.\r\n\r\n"
