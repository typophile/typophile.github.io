  body: "Nick is probably correct that there aren't any really well made digital Packards
    out there. The two I'm aware of are from <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/p/packard.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Dieter Steffmann</a> and, reportedly, <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Opti</a>.\r\n\r\nThe typeface, by the way, dates all the way
    back to 1913 (Ozwald Cooper)."
