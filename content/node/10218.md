  body: If you do a search on Star Trek you will find numerous sites offering various
    fonts from the Movies and TV series. One called DEEP SPACE NINE was made to look
    like this font. There may be others.  <BR> <BR>I did not point to the sites, because
    I think some contain unauthorized copies of commercial fonts.

  body: Bitstream once did a couple of Star Trek fonts, but renamed  <BR>them afterwards.
    It&#39;s very well possible this one is amongst  <BR>those. Gimme a minnit.

  body: Nope. I found <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/sonic/" target="_blank">
    Sonic</a>, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/horizon/" target="_blank">
    Horizon</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/galaxy/" target="_blank">
    Galaxy</a>, but neither of them is it. <BR> <BR>What do you think of Thirstype&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=Orbit" target="_blank"> Orbit</a>
    by chester and Rick Valicenti?  <BR>It&#39;s much nicer than <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/handel-gothic/"
    target="_blank"> Handel Gothic</a> and has a light weight.

  body: Thanks for all of your help. It is similar to Galaxy BT; whenever I tried
    Identifont, I would get HandelGothic as a result. I guess it was just a custom
    typeface made for Star Trek III&#39;s opening credits, thus unavailable for all.
