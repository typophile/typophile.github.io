  I'm having with fonts on my Mac.\r\n\r\nI have just done a fresh system install
  (OS X Version 10.5.6) and now activating my fonts once again in Fontbook (Version
  2.1) I currently have only 30 fonts active in Fontbook, and struggling to active
  certain fonts. I have just noticed that InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop have
  atleast 100 active fonts, including certain ones I have been unable to open in Fontbook.\r\n\r\nPlease
  can someone help?\r\n\r\nThanks v much\r\nSiaronx"

    products sometimes have fonts reserved only for us in adobe???

    discovered 140 fonts in this folder! Would these have been part of the CS suite
    when it was installed?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSiaronx"

  body: "Most likely. Adobe CS installs fonts in that location.\r\n\r\nWith respect
    to jsmi's comment, there's nothing in the license of which I'm aware that reserves
    those fonts for use only in Adobe applications. You can move or copy them to another
    font folder if you want to access them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnyone wanting to make
    fonts available only to their own applications would probably store them inside
    the application bundle rather than in /library/application support.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
