  Or, more generally, a typeface that has photo/camera symbols?\r\n\r\nIf you don't
  know what the symbol looks like here is one version:\r\nhttp://xaonon.dyndns.org/logos/portal/aperture_science.png\r\n\r\nThx\r\n"

    apertures. If you need any change in the parameters\r\n(more elements, fewer,
    different widths,...), let me know,\r\nbecause my source code is parametric.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nLuc\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/Apacha-Ichiban22.html\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/Apacha-Ichiban.ttf\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/Apacha-Ichiban.pfa\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/Apacha-Ichiban.pfb\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/Apacha-Ichiban.afm"

    download.

  body: 'In fact the glyphs are inside (I can see them in FontLab), but there is the
    usual matter of Unicode ranges and supported codepages. The bad news: all glyphs
    are PUA, so they need either renaming, or cheating with Unicode values to get
    them working. Or this can be done via opentype, replacing for example the bullet
    symbol from all aperture glyphs (which should display a glyph selection palette).
    But believe me, this can become quite messy... So, Luc, any ideas?'

  body: "Well, they work for me. I give my dingbat glyphs special names for several\r\nreasons.
    I don't want to start calling symbols \"a\" that do not represent\r\nthe glyph
    \"a\" just because it is technically convenient. \r\nI always design type 1 versions
    first (so try the pfb/afm combination).\r\nMost software should handle the type
    1 (PostScript) files correctly.\r\nWhen I generate ttf fonts from type 1 fonts,
    programs such as FontForge\r\nput the specially named symbols in an area outside
    the regular glyph area, \r\nand so, renaming may be necessary for some applications,
    as you pointed out.\r\nIn summary: try the type 1 version, and let me know."

    doesn't open correctly.
