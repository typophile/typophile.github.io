  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;d like to purchase one of these but i&rsquo;m not sure which would suit my needs more. if it wasnt for the price, i&rsquo;d jump on Fontlab without hesitation, but that&rsquo;s a hefty sum to go throwing about any old day of the week&hellip;</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been exploring fontlab for the past few weeks, but like any good program, i feel i havent even scratched the surface of some of the more exciting features&hellip;e.g. opentype etc&hellip;</p>
<p>i havent tried out typetool because i figure if you raise the bar on the learning curve you&rsquo;ll rise to the occasion&hellip;hmm..</p>
<p>so if anyone has had experiences with both and prefer one or the other, i&rsquo;d love to know all about it. i dont want to purchase something that in a few months i&rsquo;ll wish i hadnt, or wish i had just gone on to the more feature rich program. i havent been working on digitizing typefaces very long so my knowledge of what is important in a program is pretty minimal but i&rsquo;d like to really become occupied with it.</p>
<p>thanks all-
*redesign is great!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>well, i want to start by getting familiar with the program/s and get better at &lsquo;having an eye for it&rsquo;. like being able to carry characteristics from one glyph to another to all. keeping that visual consistency. it seems really difficult right now&hellip;</p>
<p>but down the road i&rsquo;d really like to create some usable and respectable text and display typefaces. right now it&rsquo;s more a hobby than anything, but since most of my logos i&rsquo;ve done have used some sort of accompanying typeface with the mark, it got me really interested in adding to the sketches i already have for my own use and for any freelance that may pop up.</p>
<p>i dont want to miss the boat on all of the features opentype has to offer which is why i&rsquo;m leaning toward fontlab (even though i dont know a lick about how to use any of those features&hellip;) but as i&rsquo;ve been playing around with the demo, i&rsquo;ve figured out quite a bit and maybe it wont be such a hurdle to overcome&hellip;</p>
<p>maybe i just answered my own question too&hellip; :)</p>

<p>I have both of these programs, and as I recall TypeTool has very limited transform features compared to FontLab, and for that matter, to Fontographer (transform featurs are, of course, not called that in FOG — and let&rsquo;s hope they never will be).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i think purchasing typetool for the $99.00 US dollars it is, isnt a bad route to follow. after all, the upgrade to fontlab makes up the difference if i had just purchased it in the first place&hellip;as long as files work from program to program (as i assume they would) it would be nice to start something on the less tech-heavy side and move into fontlab (hopefully 5.0 by that time) and give it the features fontlab has to offer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Will,</p>
<p>Have you heard that Fontographer is now being developed by FontLab Ltd? So, it has a new life.</p>
<p>Even in its present state, Fontographer sounds like the right tool for the level of use you are describing. If you go by price then you will later regret not having the ability to add the keyboards, font families and cross-platform features which Fontographer has.</p>
<p>This kind of discussion is very personal and I&rsquo;m just giving my opinion based on ten years of taking calls like yours. I fyou tell me more about what you expect to do I can help you narrow it down. The Fontographer forum archives contain good evidence that I am not just telling everyone to use Fontographer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like buying a pair of gloves, you can post messages asking what kind of gloves are the best but only you can tell if you like them once you put them on and use them awhile.</p>

Jimmy G.
