  body: "Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nI noticed there is no mention of supporing the curs feature...
    Is that going to be included as well or no? I really hope so...\r\n\r\n(For a
    number of reasons I want to avoid VOLT, including the fact that I like programming
    the feature file directly and want to use ps curves, not ttf. I eagerly await
    when FL can handle these features!). \r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\nIdris"
