body: "FontArk, the browser based font creator continue evolving.\r\n\r\nWe've just
  equipped FontArk's system with fresh new Outline editing tools, leaving the \"mono-linear\"
  days behind.\r\nFontArk's synchronized Skeleton infrastructure was built to enable
  this. You can now control the Outline Nodes freely in relation to the Skeleton Nodes.
  Although not covering all the possibilities out there (yet), it covers pretty much
  and enable super fast and flexible prototyping and experimenting.\r\n\r\nThis video
  gives a taste of the new functionality:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/jjgo7boQnxo\r\n\r\nFull
  upgrade details + video tutorial  here:\r\nhttp://fontark.net/farkwp/december-2014-upgrade-advance-outline-editing-is-here/\r\n\r\nAll
  the features are freely available to test and use at www.fontark.net\r\nComments
  and experience with it are most welcome"
