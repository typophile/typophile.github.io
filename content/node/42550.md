body: "I'm always curious about how other graphic and type designers categorize their
  fonts within their type management apps. I have worked with people in the past who
  organize sets by client or project. That always seemed like a pain to me. I use
  basic set categories:\r\n\r\n- Graphic\r\n- Handwriting\r\n- Serif\r\n- San Serif\r\n-
  Script\r\n- Vintage\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to to take it to the next step are there
  any additional categories that I could include? What do you do?\r\n\r\nBasic question
  I know...but I thought I would throw it out there."

    will become refined. \r\n\r\nI do wish that there was an industry standard for
    categorizing fonts, and this tag would be embedded in the font file. When you
    dragged your font into your app, it would automatically file itself in the correct
    category(s).\r\n\r\nHas anyone else thought about this for the next version of
    OpenType? I think all of us can think of a time when we've spent an hour looking
    for a typeface we could see in our brain, but couldn't find in our library."

    few suggestions that might help organization.

  body: "FeeltheKern, I like the info embedding idea. Similar to adding description
    meta data to an image.\r\n\r\nI was looking on FontShop's a category called \"Slab\".
    How do you classify a slab font? Some look similar to serifs others had a slight
    san serif feel.  "

  body: "I never needed a classification, I also put them altogether alphabetically.
    in my researches and my thoughts, I always use the categories / hierarchy based
    on the historical classification of maximilien vox, with a subdivision of the
    Lineale family (sans serif) as proposed by lewis blackwell. it is as follows:\r\n\r\n-
    manuaires (types which imitates the early ucial monks handwriting, where each
    letter is separated)\r\n- humanes (early types of Jenson et al, strongly influenced
    by calligraphy)\r\n- garaldes (classic types of Garamond et al, with an inclined
    axis)\r\n- reales (transitional types, baskerville etc, vertical axis)\r\n- didones
    (Bodoni style, strong contrast, horizontal serif, vertical axis)\r\n- mecanes
    (slab serif, sometimes wrongly called egyptian, very bold)\r\n- incises (flare
    types such as optima or penumbra)\r\n- lineales grotesques (early sans serif,
    akzidenz et al)\r\n- lineales humanistiques (sans serif with roman proportions
    and structure, gill sans etc)\r\n- lineales geometriques (geometric sans, futura
    etc)\r\n- lineales modernes (swiss rebirth of sans serif in the sixties, helvetica,
    univers etc)\r\n- lineales contemporaines (contemporary works in the sans serif
    theme, vista, ff cocon, etc)\r\n- fraktures (british and german types wrongly
    called gothic)\r\n- scriptes (imitating the linked calligraphy)\r\n\r\nthis classification
    bears the advantage of being validated by Atypi in 1962, and it is widely used
    and quite useful.\r\n\r\ndr\r\n"

    me.</cite>\r\n\r\nI do both:\r\nI have two superordinate folders (in Linotype
    FEX, that is): \r\n\u2018by source\u2019 and \u2018by style\u2019\r\n<ul><li>First
    of all, all new fonts <em>always</em> go into their group within the former, according
    to their origin:\r\n\u2018Adobe CS2 (bundled)\u2019, \u2018House Industries\u2019,
    \u2018xyz.com (freebie)\u2019 &c.\r\nThis reflects the naturally developing Finder
    structure (purchases, downloads) \u2013 and thus, it\u2019s no extra work.</li>\r\n<li>these
    groups then get labeled with a colour: Green for \u2018commercial license, no
    restrictions\u2019, yellow for \u2018only non-commercial use\u2019, blue for \u2018freebie\u2019
    &c.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat way, I always know where I got them from and what I
    am allowed to do with them.\r\n\r\nIn a second step, I sort them by style:\r\n<ul><li>I
    copy selected fonts into categories, similar to those mentioned by David or Patty
    above</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe advantage is: while a font always has only <strong>one</strong>
    origin, it can have multiple styles; e.g. it can be \u2018Display\u2019 <em>and</em>
    \u2018Retro\u2019 <em>and</em> \u2018Mecane\u2019 <em>and</em> \u2018Very fat\u2019
    \u2026\r\nNo problem, just do multiple copies in the \u2018Style\u2019 folder!\r\n\r\n<cite>I
    do it alphabetically, by typeface name.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is a thing I never
    understood (they did it in University too, ordered even like a telephone book,
    grouping fonts that have nothing in common: \u2018A\u2013C\u2019, \u2018D\u2013F\u2019,
    \u2026): This is a something the application additionally offers anyway, isn\u2019t
    it?\r\nIf I am looking for a font starting with \u2018Soft\u2026\u2019, I\u2019d
    type \u2018soft\u2019 into the search field.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: I kinda hate categorization. my dream method would be to have explorer software
    that lets you add your own tags to typefaces ala flickr or last.fm, then you could
    do a search for something like "baroque script bold" and get back specific typefaces.
    i wish iTunes had a tagging system as well instead of stupdid, simplistic categories.

  body: "Yeah, Paul, that\u2019s my dream, too. ;\xB0)\r\nActually, you <em>can</em>
    do it: FEX\u2019s \u2018information\u2019 window takes multiple comments. One
    could go through all fonts and tag them that way: \u2018baroque, script, bold,
    language-coverage:ce, x-height:xl, client:XYZ, osf\u2019.\r\nBut of course, that\u2019s
    a PITA, as you cannot export/exchange those self-made tags.\r\nI\u2019d love the
    Linotype people to integrate a simpler tagging functionality, and then one would
    be able to download and assign tag sets from the foundries, or from Typophile. "

  body: "Notice how many people have replied that essentially their system has to
    make sense to them. With this as background, how would an industry standard work?
    What would the categories be based on, who would decide the tags? Would you go
    along with someone else's system?\r\n\r\nFor instance, fonts that straddle categories
    would need to belong to both (or all). What is the standard \"first place to look\"
    if a design is a geometric sans AND a script at the same time? This is not a rhetorical
    question, look at Mark Simonson's Coquette.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with my, or
    anyone's classifications, then that kind of wrecks the idea of a standard; everyone
    has their own perceptions and ways of associating typefaces with each other or
    with concepts like \"elegant\", or \"casual\" or \"square\". We see the differences
    of opinion here every day. One person's \"square\" is another person's \"geometric\".\r\n\r\nThe
    tag cloud in Flickr gives an interesting way to conceive of different but related
    items. FontShop also put out a poster showing their types all arranged in a sort
    of cloud, with proximity based on similarity. In this way they are unlinked from
    \"classifications\" and linked instead to associations, either conceptual or visual. "

    it was never adopted by everyone. It's also hard to understand.\r\n\r\nThe guys
    at Extensis said at Typecon that they actually go through MANUALLY and categorize
    as many typefaces as they can for their databases used in their software. That
    does allow for auto categorization, just off of the sweat of their brow and at
