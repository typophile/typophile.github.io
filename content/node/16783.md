body: "Hi there,\r\nmy first topic/post. And it's about an pixelfont I want to use
  for my website. The name is RT Pixa.\r\nI thought it would be nice to have a sans/serif-pixelfont-family
  of my own with swash italic and a real sc-font. It is quit tall and i think it has
  a good legiblility. But I don't know what to do to make it an working font.\r\n\r\nMeasurements:\r\nAscender
  9 px\r\nCaps 8 px\r\nSC 7 px\r\nx height 7px\r\ndecender -3 px\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I have
  12 px bodyheight without Cap accents. what I heard about pixelfonts is that i have
  to divide the postscript square with the bodyheight (1000 / 12 is 83,3 which doesnt
  work) looking at other pixelfonts like underwares Unibody didn't help me. The other
  thing I heard is that I should use the measurements of an 8 pixelfont (125 units)
  and go over the ps-square. I use an mac but want to make it an free openTypefont
  for windows, too. So what shoul I do? Thanks, Eric.\r\n\r\nP.S.: the italics are
  raw beta"

    with the font. See below...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/square83.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    don't think that the 0.4% variance would not become an issue unless you set some
    VERY long words."
