  body: hanif <BR> <BR>You might take a look at Monotype Pastonchi &#40;available
    from Monotype Imaging&#41;. When the metal version was released the promotional
    book that was issued &#40;printed, with specimen showings, by Giovanni Mardersteig&#41;
    indicated that it was a complete rethinking of what constituted a renaissance
    face &#40;based on hand written forms rather than printer&#39;s type, which at
    the time was also based on hand written forms&#41;. The Monotype metal version
    was released relatively late in the scheme of things so it never got its proper
    due. The digital version released by Monotype Typography in the late 90s is quite
    an exact replication of the metal version. It is quite an interesting and unique
    face.

  body: Pastonchi is indeed quite interesting.  <BR> <BR>One of our &#40;Adobe&#39;s&#41;
    faces that I quite like that takes the same theoretical approach - though with
    very different results - is Brioso. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Guys, this is very clever, but bad advice. Hanif wants the real thing, not
    a latter-day version. <BR> <BR>He wants Beethoven and you&#39;re suggesting John
    Williams.

  body: Nick <BR> <BR>Pastonchi is not a latter-day version of anything. It was effort
    on the part of Francesco Pastonchi and Eduardo Cotti to convey the letterforms
    of the Italian tradition in the fifteenth century. It was released by the Lanston
    Monotype Corporation, London about 1927. At least that is the date that is to
    be found on a printed specimen included in the printing of the Mardersteig book.
    The digital version was released by Monotype Typography in beta form in 1997.
    Does that make it a John Williams? <BR> <BR>The dates you give for Bembo, Jenson,
    Poliphilus are dates that are associated with the original printed specimens from
    which the early twentieth century metal versions of these faces were based. Since
    most digital typefaces did not exist before the mid-1980s how then do we find
    Beethoven?

  body: "Ok. I&#39;ll bite.  <BR> <BR>I would say that Pastonchi and Brioso both seem
    to be more a tribute to that era than an actual revival...if you follow me. If
    someone asked me for a typeface from that era--granted actually from the era is
    impossible--I would most probably follow Nick&#39;s recommendations. But, if someone
    wanted something that hints at or resembles that era with some of the dust blown
    of it then I could understand Pastonchi and Brioso. <BR> <BR>my 2\xA2"

  body: Tiffany <BR> <BR>Pastonchi is not any less a revival than Bembo and Poliphilus
    are themselves tributes. In all three cases the typefaces are based on letterforms
    of the period. To say that Bembo or Poliphilus are exact copies of faces that
    existed in the 15th century is erroneous. They are simply reconstructions, as
    well as was Pastonchi. <BR> <BR>That Pastonchi did not fare as well as Bembo or
    Poliphilus has less to do with its pedigree than its late release, in 1928, and
    the much larger event that was forthcoming, that being the Great Depression. <BR>
    <BR>One can actually track the release or lack of release of foundry designs by
    the ups and downs of the back to back recessions that lasted from 1929 up to 1941,
    resolved only with the preparations for World War.

  body: That isn&#39;t what I was saying. I agree that none of them are exact. But,
    I believe that the latter three are closer than is your suggestion of Pastonchi.
    I also know that this is all subjective. It is simply my opinion that Pastonchi,
    and Brioso for that matter, are less close to what might be called an accurate
    revival of the 1500-era garamond-style type. Pastonchi reminds me a bit of Perpetua
    for that matter.

  body: Tiffany <BR> <BR>I&#39;m confused. What do Bembo, Poliphilus, et al have to
    do with the later Garamond-like faces? <BR> <BR>Pastonchi was an attempt at correction
    of popular misconceptions about renaissance faces. Can&#39;t state it any more
    clearly than that. <BR> <BR>Reminds you of Perpetua does it? Hmmm.

  body: Nothing. I was reaching and missed with that comparison. <BR> <BR>I simply
    find Nick&#39;s recommendations to be a little more authentic. But, Hanif didn&#39;t
    say he needed authentic so perhaps none of this matter.

    <BR>Im doing a &#34;newspaper&#34; as a schoolwork. This newspaper is ought to
    be a renaissance newspaper who has all the history and happenings of the renaissance
    period in it.  <BR> <BR>My task is to &#34;design&#34; the newspaper so it looks
    like if its from that era. <BR> <BR>maybe ive done my self a little more clear
    of what i want.

    this could still make sense, but before you figure out what the &#34;look&#34;
    should be I think you need to think about the raison d&#39;
