  I'm using Berthold City bold set in caps for some various headings and [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans
  | Benton Sans]] as my main grotesque. For the feature stories (body copy) and for
  some headings I need a serif to work along with Benton Sans. I have tried various
  classics from my collection - Adobe Caslon, Baskerville etc \u2013 but It doesn't
  seem right. Somehow they clash.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a serif to work along
  with Bentons Sans and Berthold City?\r\n\r\nI've included the cover to give you
  an idea of the look. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/loebemagasinet_01_cover_5070.jpg]"
