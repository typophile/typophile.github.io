  German engine block circa 1940.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DB605A_TM_3779.jpg]\r\nThanks
  for your time.\r\n\r\nClint"

  body: This is a very widely used stencil typeface. I don't know if there is one
    true digital version, but P22 Pop Art Stencil comes close.

  body: "Thanks Queneau & Bob, it is also very similar to Bodoni Stencil. It is very
    widely used and familiar looking to lots of other stencil fonts but it's mainly
    the numeral 2 that sets this typeface apart from the rest. Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nClint"

  body: It reminds me of a pre-digital stencil typeface called Charrette, but examples
    appear elusive at the moment...although, perhaps, simply because I'm a little
    weary at the moment. There's a nap for that...

    at least one free font named Charrette."

    2 being almost identical to the image posted the numeral 7 is very different.\r\n\r\nWarm
