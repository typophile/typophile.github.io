body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/100px-Bauhaus_logo_4535.png]\r\nThe International
  Style\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, just after World War II, elements of Futurism, Constructivism
  and the Bauhaus were distilled into a utopian system of grids, sans serif type and
  neutrality known as the International Style. The visual system was based upon the
  belief that the typography should be totally clear allowing no distraction from
  the content.\r\nThis visual order had no links to historical traditions and eschewed
  any references to culture or geography. Its adaptability to any place and application
  \u2014 architecture, furniture, product and graphic design\u2014allowed it to become
  a world-wide style, or international style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's very pleasing to my
  eye when I see and do simplistic and industrialize art, but in my mind it seems
  like I'm not truly being creative.  The heavy use of a ruler and measurements tend
  to dampen my accomplishment.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Andy_Warhol_6085.png]\r\nPop
  Art\r\n\r\nA movement that blurred the lines between art, commerce and popular culture.
  After the large-scale pop art exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York
  in 1962, Pop Art established itself as a serious, recognized form of art. This exhibition
  became a turning point for Modernism when a series of critics foresaw the end of
  modernism and the beginning of the postmodern era. Although Pop was treated more
  as entertainment, it had a serious impact on the period. Leading American artists
  of the Pop Art movement was Andy Warhol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I must admit that Pop Art
  is a movement I really don't care for, it's just too cheesy for me.  But at the
  same time I can relate to the fact that just like Pop Art, Graphic Design/Digital
  Art would never be recognize fully as art.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sagmesiter_chicken_6103.jpg]\r\nGrunge\r\nAustrian
  Sagmeister's work can make viewers feel a bit uneasy \u2014 chickens with their
  heads cut off, words scratched into his own skin and giant cow's tongues. Sagmeister
  \"defines how to get attention in a way that creates an idea.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is
  a design still good if you can't understand it?\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designhistory.org/Post_mod.html\r\n"
