		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the best typefaces for children would be what they&rsquo;re already used to – sounds circular but it&rsquo;s not really. Any faces with unusual treatments of letters, like Ambroise&rsquo;s <strong>g</strong> I&rsquo;d stay away from. Children&rsquo;s brains are built to understand that different instances of the same thing are the same thing. If the child&rsquo;s parents speak with different dialects, they don&rsquo;t have problems understanding both equally well. But if someone speaking a radically different dialect tries communicating, the kid might get confused because they haven&rsquo;t set up the sound-equivalences in their brains yet. Similarly with type (I would think), they learn very quickly that single-storey <strong>a</strong> and two-storey <strong>a</strong> are the same thing, but might not recognise Galliard Italic&rsquo;s <strong><em>g</em></strong>. Sans vs serif? My guess would be any comprehension differences would be minimal and could be without significance difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say pick something that looks nice with your book and make it fun.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, I am to this day confused about your position against skeleton-based lettermaking. As a guideline for type design, it makes ample sense. It&rsquo;s perfectly clear that type designers should be designing the inner and outer outlines, not some imaginary skeleton. But this should be all behind the scenes stuff, in service of the reader. When you talk about the need to instil doubt into children about skeleton-based lettermaking, you lose me. Nor is it clear to me that children are going to develop different opinions about letter-making just because they are brought up reading Legato instead of Helvetica.</p>
<p>Skeleton-based thinking may be detrimental to good type design, but skeletons play a crucial part in how we perceive forms such as letters. We are able to recognize glyphs in vastly different styles to be representing the same character thanks to their shared structure. So lay people are perfectly justified in thinking of letters in terms of skeletons. They do not have to understand what makes the type they read successful, any more than they have to understand the theory of jet propulsion and lift to enjoy air travel.</p>
<p>Also, I am not ready to give up writing by hand. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that many people hardly ever write with their own hand for anyone else to read, and only ever read type. But I am not convinced that we should forcibly be removing the connection between the forms we make by hand and the forms that we read. And I am certainly not convinced that we should not be writing letters by hand that are meant to be read.</p>
<p>Indeed, for the moment, access to type technology is limited for certain cultures, and the standards of typography aren&rsquo;t advanced enough for certain writing systems for type to supplant handwriting. I understand Hrant&rsquo;s desire for progress, but be careful with pushing type too fast; limitations of technology have often forced simplifications on writing systems in the past (elimination of ligatures, conjuncts, contextual variations), whether desirable or not. For many writing systems, type is still playing catch-up to handwriting when it comes to beauty and readability.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael, by &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; I mean the paths* that a person making a letter follows* with a marking tool* to make positive shapes on a negative background. The essential problem being that this goes against reading.

<ul>
<li>This could be real or virtual.</li>

<p>Brian*, simply put, it seems to me that making letters -and thinking about letters- as augmented skeletons is a convenience that is now at the limits of paying for itself. The more time passes, the more harm we&rsquo;ll be doing by engaging in this ideological lethargy. Concerning type design, I really can&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s beneficial anymore, and I <em>can</em> see how it&rsquo;s harmful.</p>

<p>But «shared structure» doesn&rsquo;t have to imply they&rsquo;re all just different coverings on the same basic scaffolding, or skeleton. 
Although I can&rsquo;t claim I understand how we recognize letters when reading, it does seem plausible to doubt the idea that when we read, we somehow, internally, «extract» (or abstract) monolinear «skeletons» from whatever glyphs we&rsquo;re presented with, discarding serifs and contrast, and all that at breakneck speed. Maybe it&rsquo;s more helpful (more flexible) to think not of a shared <em>linear</em> structure, but as a shared distribution/pattern of <em>black and white areas</em> that is necessary to recognize a character?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I might be thinking of skeleton in a broader sense than you (Nina, Hrant) understand.</p>
<p>As Nina implies, reading happens at such a basic level that it&rsquo;s beyond our ability to understand simply by reflection. Object recognition—character recognition included—mostly does not involve higher cognitive processes, but it&rsquo;s certainly a complex process that we have trouble replicating with machines (hence the existence of captchas). It&rsquo;s not clear which features are extracted from the visual inputs, and it seems that several modes may be in operation (a primary mode picks up simple, familiar inputs and a secondary mode distinguishes the details not picked up by the first one). But for me, intuitively, the idea is that the brain reduces the words (or any object to be recognized) into simple components whose spatial arrangement is the key to its recognition. There are multiple levels at work here, of course, and things like serifs and areas of contrast present visual cues that enhance recognition. These cues are of course really important. But I think they work in service to the primary mode of recognition, which is based on the spatial arrangement of the basic shapes (like the idea that the letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; consists of a straight vertical line segment and a curved segment attached to its right), which is what I&rsquo;m really thinking of as the skeleton.</p>
<p>A skeleton of a &ldquo;D&rdquo;, absent all other cues, would still be recognizable as a &ldquo;D&rdquo;. You can have all the components (the serifs, the contrast, etc.) that make a typographically successful &ldquo;D&rdquo; but if they are not put together according to the skeleton (the particular configuration of shapes) of a &ldquo;D&rdquo;, no one will recognize it as one. So the skeleton is an essential part of a letter&rsquo;s identity, and as I think of it, is more abstract than merely the path traced by someone with a marking utensil to produce a letter.</p>
<p>I have to admit that it&rsquo;s really difficult to verbalize and explain what I&rsquo;m thinking, and it&rsquo;s hard to see where it is that we actually disagree!</p>
<p>Hrant, until most of humanity is ready to give up writing by hand forever, I would be hesitant to sever that link. Type design is accessible only to a tiny minority, and the technology is more likely to have a dumbing-down effect and stifle innovation. In cultures where people still produce by hand texts that are meant to be read, I think there is a bit more room for innovation and individual expression. But here, I&rsquo;m thinking more of scripts like Arabic than Latin.</p>
<p>(Either Brian and Jongseong is fine. They both are my given names; I just chose Jongseong as my ID because it would be less likely to be a duplicate ID. Perhaps Jongseong will be less confusing for casual readers who don&rsquo;t check the profile pages.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The point is I wouldn&rsquo;t use paths. It&rsquo;s hard to think in other terms (not least because we&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated on skeletons since birth - see below) but we really need to think in terms of the border between the black and white, the interaction between not only the blacks in a setting but the whites too. This is what Legato does, and/but -so far- it&rsquo;s the only one.</p>
<p>Since this topic is [supposed to be] about children, let me give an example of how we&rsquo;re brainwashed into thinking of letters in terms of skeletons from the very beginning. Look at this thing done by my 3-year-old in pre-school:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/gorgim_4785.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the third letter of the Armenian alphabet. Now, a kid that age isn&rsquo;t good enough to draw a nice letter fluidly (at least not good enough for his parent to want to show it off :-) so look what they&rsquo;ve done: they drew a circle and a couple of lines and told the kids to stamp along the skeleton. This isn&rsquo;t really [necessarily] a &ldquo;moving front&rdquo; thing, but the very least I can claim is it&rsquo;s reducing the chances that these kids are going to make the kinds of fonts I think we need.  :-)</p>

<p>the idea is that the brain reduces the words (or any object to be
recognized) into simple components whose spatial arrangement

</blockquote>
<p>Sure. But that&rsquo;s not how chirography works - it uses the idea of a &ldquo;moving front&rdquo;, and the movement goes along a path. THAT is where the problems start, and that&rsquo;s what I want to limit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>until most of humanity is ready to give up writing by
hand forever, I would be hesitant to sever that link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually it&rsquo;s not about completely shunning it. It&rsquo;s about limiting it, but far more than what we&rsquo;ve seen in type design so far. Most people don&rsquo;t even see there&rsquo;s a problem, so they can&rsquo;t be part of the solution (that being not some utopia, but merely improvement).</p>
<p>We cannot improve any more along this path - we&rsquo;re stuck in a rut.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In cultures where people still produce by hand texts that
are meant to be read, I think there is a bit more room for
innovation and individual expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to innovation: I think the opposite. When it comes to expression: I think that&rsquo;s selfish artistry; typefaces can express things in a subtle, controlled way that benefits others. Writing by hand is self-centered.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael, I&rsquo;m not sure what Hrant means, but I would agree this much: the idea of a center line that you expand around for different weights of a design doesn&rsquo;t work very well. This is what was done by Donald Knuth in &ldquo;Metafonts,&rdquo; and the verdict seems to be that it didn&rsquo;t work. If I remember rightly, Frutiger makes that case, with illustrations, also in the new big book of his work.</p>
<p>We do recognize characters by something like topology. Whether a counter is closed or open makes a difference. Whether a line is round or has a corner is sometimes important also, like D vs O. But similar topology (I know I&rsquo;m not using it in quite the right way mathematically) isn&rsquo;t the same as having a skeleton template in our heads.</p>
<p>By the way, I think all the stuff about a single story a being easier for kids, or they will be very confused by both a double and single story g is mostly rubbish. This is all what some adults think ought to be true, but probably isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Now this sets at fairly small sizes well. I have seen a number of books already. But this is, or was conceived by doing a skeleton, or bones, and then dressing them.</p>
<p>Hrant, what did I do wrong? Simplistically, it sets well and is readable. How could I make it better according to your standards/qualifications? I really am interested in a different perspective.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael, first of all: the balanced tone is noted, appreciated and useful.
And most of all, it helps me stay cool on my end!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly commendable and fruitful for somebody chirographically inclined to note the importance of the White and take steps to account for it; this is something many people who disagree with my conclusions have cited, and I believe them. I also have to nonetheless believe that the qualitative limitation remains - that as long as you&rsquo;re &ldquo;painting&rdquo; the black you cannot really treat the White equally. No matter how you twist and turn while marking the Black, it can&rsquo;t be as ideal as marking their border.</p>
<p>A fitting parallel I like to draw is the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, his slave. No matter how much he loved her, the fact that she remained his slave limited the relationship greatly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a lettering artist my eyes perceive a clunkiness in the bolder weights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I propose that this is an aesthetic preference, formed by many years of attentive chirography. I might go further and say that even a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; person who hasn&rsquo;t paid much attention to how he makes his letters will feel that awkwardness. The important thing to remember however is that Legato is a text face (to me at least) which means conscious evaluation of large settings is beside the point, and its breaking of the Black is what gives it a presumed (and I feel probable) superiority in text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what was done by Donald Knuth in &ldquo;Metafonts,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired, quite tellingly, by the work of Zapf, a prominent chirographic designer. But no matter how much they tried, they couldn&rsquo;t get &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; fonts to look good.</p>
<p>What I put forth is that the thing that makes Knuth&rsquo;s fonts fail is present to at least some extent in <em>any</em> chirographic typeface.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I will try to explain why handwriting is not something to be so easily discarded. Despite its obvious limitations, it has probably done more for readability than most purposely non-chirographic thinking, especially the tendency to &ldquo;rational&rdquo;, geometric shapes.</p>
<p>Take Legato. When I see Legato, I don&rsquo;t see clunkiness. As Hrant posits, if you are conditioned to expect only strokes that look like they could plausibly formed with certain writing implements, it may look awkward. But if you don&rsquo;t have that baggage, the letters look perfectly natural.</p>
<p>Even more, I get a calligraphic feel from Legato (Hrant is going to furiously raise his eyebrows at this). It&rsquo;s certainly not calligraphic in the way the strokes are formed; the strokes emerge from the simultaneous design of the black and the white, not from expansion along a path. Rather, it&rsquo;s because Legato has a gentle but noticeable contrast in the strokes that depends on the angle. You can see that Legato&rsquo;s &ldquo;O&rdquo; is thinnest around 5 o' clock and 11 o' clock.</p>
<p>This sort of stroke modulation owes much to calligraphy, especially with the broad nib. At the risk of broad simplification, I think this enhances readability by adding more visual cues that distinguish differently-angled strokes than just the angles themselves.</p>
<p>Legato&rsquo;s &ldquo;O&rdquo; warrants another look, as it is not the vertically symmetric shape found in many sans designs but is gently inclined, much like a handwritten &ldquo;O&rdquo;. The curves in Legato generally stay away from the simple and symmetric shapes favoured by rationalists. This is good for readability because it means more cues for distinguishing different letters. If &ldquo;humanist sans serif&rdquo; is a term that is set in opposition to the constructed shapes of geometrics and grotesques, then Legato out-humanists the humanist sans designs that are more explicitly based on calligraphy, being constrained by neither simple geometry nor the devotion to shapes that can be produced by hand.</p>
<p>So Legato&rsquo;s strengths, I would say, are in taking from the good from handwriting without actually being constrained to make something looking like handwriting.</p>
<p>Of course, these aspects of handwriting that aid in readability developed mostly accidentally and subconsciously. A handwritten &ldquo;O&rdquo; is inclined because it is easier to write, due to handedness or whatever, not primarily because it is easier to read. Also, people must have liked the shapes produced by writing utensils that give stroke contrast for reasons of style, not readability (at least not consciously). Indeed, I think extreme contrast may hurt readability, but it is often pursued for stylistic reasons.</p>
<p>But handwriting is much faster than designing type, and it gives room for great variety and experimentation. Through repeated practice, people can learn how to correct for optical illusions and give even texture while still making easily distinguishable shapes. Also, because they are not constrained to a limited glyph set, they can automatically adjust shapes to prevent clashes.</p>
<p>So I still think a thorough familiarity with handwriting and making letters by hand is beneficial to type design. As long as you don&rsquo;t think of type as something to reproduce the shapes made by hand but as a medium to free you from those constraints (admittedly quite tricky), your experience and ideas shaped by making letters by hand should be helpful.</p>

<p>Maybe clunky was a bad choice of words&hellip; the forms (in the bolder weights) look almost contrived&hellip; that may not be any better. It is not a negative, just a perception. I do not think Hrant is suggesting the outlawing of the written form.</p>

To me the whole reverse-contrast thing just doesn&rsquo;t work in roman lower case. Heavy horizontal and light vertical works in Hebrew, but the glyphs are designed quite differently.</p>
<p>Legato is not in principle reverse-contrast, as it has the principle of twisting the outer forward and inner back. But the result in the case of the s is reverse contrast anyway.</p>
<p>The other shapes I don&rsquo;t find particularly attractive either, but the &lsquo;clunky&rsquo; I think is where the reversed-contrast pokes its head up.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Craig, that was perhaps a bit presumptuous on my part to make such conclusions on the intentions of whoever introduced stroke contrast. It&rsquo;s just that I think style is more visible than good readability (&ldquo;Hmm, that looks more stylish&rdquo; seems more likely than &ldquo;Hmm, that is easier to read&rdquo;). But maybe I&rsquo;m denying our forebearers credit unjustly here. We&rsquo;re certainly not the first generation to question how to serve the reader more.</p>
<p>William, the reverse contrast (which you also see to some degree in letters like &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo;) doesn&rsquo;t bother me as much, maybe because I&rsquo;m used to the stroke contrast model of the Korean alphabet and Chinese characters. These certainly don&rsquo;t have reverse contrast, but they can have lots of parallel horizontal strokes, and a common solution is to make the outer strokes slightly heavier; it&rsquo;s easier to see that applying this principle to the Latin lower case letters having some crowded horizontal strokes will yield heavy top and bottom strokes.</p>

<p>Well if they&rsquo;re still in the age/stage where they don&rsquo;t read fluidly, they might benefit from less «typographically complex» fonts no?* I&rsquo;m assuming that their «reading» is really closer to slow «deciphering» than to the fast reading that experienced readers do when they read long text.

<p>handwriting &hellip;. has probably done more for readability than
most purposely non-chirographic thinking, especially the tendency
to &ldquo;rational&rdquo;, geometric shapes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way I can see that at all. And you should not equate Cartesian-grid design with what I&rsquo;m saying. I am in fact quite opposed to geometry in type design.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the alternative to chirography and geometry?
Exactly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get a calligraphic feel from Legato (Hrant is
going to furiously raise his eyebrows at this)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah, I&rsquo;m totally used to it (and the same thing happens -actually, it&rsquo;s <em>supposed to</em>- when I show people my Paphos). People see what they want. That doesn&rsquo;t make a designer&rsquo;s thinking inferior; it might even reveal a weakness in the viewer.</p>
<p>That said, seeing things that aren&rsquo;t there can be very good for you, and eventually for others. When I was in Bangkok I saw certain things only because I&rsquo;d never been inside such a culture before; and I made my Daam Entity as a result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This sort of stroke modulation owes much to calligraphy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weight contrast (&quot;<em>stroke</em> contrast&quot; is misleading) is indeed beneficial to readability. But do not confuse its origins with its usefulness. You can be inspired by something but nonetheless see that it was something akin to &ldquo;dumb luck&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The broad-nib was broad for a very simple, &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; reason: you needed that so you put down enough ink. This is now completely beside the point - in fact it has been for centuries. You nicely allude to this yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>people must have liked the shapes produced by writing
utensils that give stroke contrast for reasons of style</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Must? If anything I would suggest it was the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But handwriting is much faster than designing type</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should not separate the making from the using - that&rsquo;s Art, not Craft. In fact handwriting is much much slower at communicating, which is why printing was invented, and now completely dominates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it gives room for great variety and experimentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But on a much more superficial level. Sort of like talking versus writing; the former cannot hope to achieve the depths of the latter, in fact because in the making it is too rushed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To me the whole reverse-contrast thing just doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not the customer; what about readers?</p>
<p>And as you say, it&rsquo;s not really reverse-contrast. Legato&rsquo;s genius is that it separates weight contrast from chirography and thus attempts to leverage it ideally. If some glyphs end up with horizontal contrast and some vertical, so be it; this is not display typography.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re certainly not the first generation to question how to serve the reader more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we <em>are</em> a generation that, because we have the tools and the insights of Javal and discussions such as this, now has a duty to actually do it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the a in Legato is actually pretty nice. The e I don&rsquo;t mind &hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is display-font talk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading is reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually reading changes quite abruptly around age 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing wrong with children being challenged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed - and sadly we&rsquo;re doing that less and less. We don&rsquo;t let them climb trees anymore. But the challenges should ideally be conducive towards something. It&rsquo;s important to remember you can learn to read, or read to learn. For the former I would challenge children on a letterform level, moving them from deliberative to immersive reading (for example by introducing a binocular &ldquo;g&rdquo;); for the latter I would simply make it as easy as possible to get at the content.</p>
<p>They will ask: &ldquo;Why is the &lsquo;g&rsquo; different in these two books?&rdquo;
Good!</p>
