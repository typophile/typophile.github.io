  for a headline. \r\n\r\nThe article is about high tech camera systems and technologies
  to detect terrorism, and trying to prevent terrorism from occuring using these systems.
  \r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a good font to capture the mood of this subject? A nice
  'dark technological' typeface would be great! I've chosen Bank gothic, but I think
  there are ones that are slightly better. A non-commercial font would be great too
  (since this is a university project and won't be sold or mass produced).     \r\n\r\nYour
  opinions and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!\r\n\r\nThank you for your
  time. \r\n\r\nVincent.  \r\n"

  body: What is the tone of the article? Is it how they use the technology or is it
    a sense of urgency? If its a sense of urgency try something powerful like Impact
    all caps.
