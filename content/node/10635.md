  body: Nice, Cheshire. <BR> <BR>I pulled that Glaser quote out a number of years
    back from research while I was writing my BFA thesis. I&#39;ll dig it up and see

  body: so y not investigate on what he truly is talking about? does he mean ppl who
    dont have a truly firm foundation in design, would prolly direct themselves to
