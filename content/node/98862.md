  Naked Truth: From the Shadows of the Bible\" on Google Books when doing a search
  for \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\".\r\n\r\nI was able to find out that it was \"Windy\"
  by The Association that held that song back to the #2 spot, just as Lesley Gore's
  \"You Don't Own Me\" never got above #2, being sandwiched between two hits by a
  new group out of Britain... \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and \"She Loves You (Yeah,
  Yeah, Yeah)\" on its highest week.\r\n\r\nIn any event, [[http://books.google.ca/books?id=lXWDZnersAAC|this
  book]] has its body copy set in... Papyrus."

    Best Seller list any time soon.
