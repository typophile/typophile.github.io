    you just have to open the glyphs pallette by going to TYPE>GLYPHS.\r\n\r\nYou
    can click each one to get it's unicode, or double-click it to put it into a selected
    text field.\r\n\r\nAlso, Apple's TextEdit has a similar window EDIT>SPECIAL CHARACTERS
    (cmnd+opt+t). This will actually give you a lot more information than illustrator
    or indesign do.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's a way to do it in word, but I never use
    it."

  body: "I don't think it will be easy to do this without some programming, or a repetitive
    motion injury-inducing amount of mouse clicking.\r\n\r\nYou basically need to
    loop through the entries in the cmap and produce a string corresponding to each
    character code, appending to an output string. It seems like it should be possible
    to do something like this in FontLab using Python. As I am fairly non-Pythonic
    I cannot offer any specific advice (I achieve the same thing using tools written
    in another programming language instead), but I can suggest this non-language-specific
    pseudo-code:\r\n<code>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each characterCode
    in fontUnicodeArray:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set
    myString to myString + unichr(characterCode)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print
    myString\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n\"unichr\" is a function that converts a number (i.e.
    character code value) into a Unicode string. I believe Python has a something
    like that ;-)  Maybe you or someone else can fill in the other bits in proper
    Python (and FontLab) form and get what you're after...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For the record, here is the my final script. You may jazz it as you want.
    \r\n\r\nI finally remembered that with the Python <code>unicodedata</code> module
    one can check for the name of a unicode character (but with the narrow build of
    Python on the Mac, one cannot process that way characters above 0xFFFF). That
    can be quite handy. Here is an example:\r\n<code>\r\n>>> from unicodedata import
    *\r\n>>> name(unichr(0x05D0)); name(unichr(0x0627)); name(unichr(0x0905))\r\n'HEBREW
    LETTER ALEF'\r\n'ARABIC LETTER ALEF'\r\n'DEVANAGARI LETTER A'\r\n>>> \r\n</code>\r\nThe
    script thus simply outputs the unicode characters in the font whose code is in
    the range <code>0x0020</code> -- <code>0xFFFF</code> and that have a name in the
    unicode namelist (according to the <code>unicodedata</code> function \"<code>name</code>\").
    Here it is:\r\n<code>\r\n----\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\nimport fontforge,sys\r\nfrom
    unicodedata import *\r\nfnt=fontforge.open(sys.argv[1],1)\r\n\r\ns=''\r\nglyphset=fnt.glyphs()\r\nfor

    <= cdg <= 0xFFFF):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uni=unichr(cdg)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if
