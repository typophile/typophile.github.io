  body: 'Have you seen, James Puckett''s [[http://dunwichtype.com/typelibrary/|Type
    Library]]? There is a section dedicated to, Lettering & Calligraphy. I am not
    sure if it is exactly the kind of thing you mean but maybe you could get in touch
    with him if you are thinking along the same lines? [[http://typophile.com/node/85441|This]]
