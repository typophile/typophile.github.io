body: Hello typophilers, <BR> <BR>Is there such a thing as a definitive list of font
  weights? You know the sort of thing - hairline through to ultra black. I have been
  writing my own and it&#39;s growing very large but I am getting the feeling that
  I am missing out on a lot of them. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>PAUL

  body: I&#39;m affraid there isn&#39;t one all-encompassing list. Different type  <BR>families
    have different weight names, and weights with the  <BR>identical names might come
    on a different spot in the &#34;weight  <BR>scale&#34; across type families. For
    example the &#34;Book&#34; weight is  <BR>usually lighter than the &#34;Regular&#34;
    or &#34;Normal&#34; weight but bolder  <BR>in FF Meta. Same goes for &#34;Heavy&#34;
    and &#34;Semibold&#34;.
