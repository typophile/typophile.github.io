  I''m currently using Gotham but since it''s been used so much, I''m worried it will
  be just a huge trend and not stay around. Any suggestions? Thanks! '

  body: "Not much of a recommendation - just an observation.\r\n\r\nFor a resume I
    don't think I would worry too much about the staying power - unless you plan on
    it taking quite a while to find a job :P. I would also suggest picking something
    that matches your own personal branding if you have any, rather than just picking
    an obligatory classic typeface etc."

  body: "I've not done my resume for a LOOOOOng tim now, but here goes:\r\n\r\nI'd
    use Helvetica for the single reason that it's 'invisible'. Your type selection
    won't get any attention and the employer-to-be will focus only on the information
    in it, which is what you're after (I guess). He can then dive into your portfolio,
    which should be chock-a-block full of interesting typeface choices.\r\n\r\nHope
    it helps!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "yes, these help! I do have some personal branding, but I was worried it would
    be too much (trade gothic). Unfortunately it actually has been taking a while
    to find a job, but i'm trying to be positive! But thats another blog issue, lol.
    Thanks for your help and recco's, I had just been wondering what direction I should
    go while updating my resume.\r\n\r\nP.S. you're right about Helvetica and being
    'invisible' and using it for mass infomation, ha... maybe i'll give it a shot!
    \r\n\r\nkeep them coming! Have a great day everyone ;)"

  body: Sorry Frank, I meant 'invisible' in a 'ubiquitous' kind of way (it's everywhere
    so don't notice it anymore). I might amend my comment to Univers, though. Which
    I thinks works better than Helvetica (design-wise).
