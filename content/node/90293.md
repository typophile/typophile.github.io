  body: "A side question... in trying to achieve the bend in SOLDIERS, I'm using the
    warp text tool in PS7, with the \"shell lower\" option, and with a -negative bend.
    I've got the right idea, but it doesn't warp it to the proper proportions. What
    am I missing here?\r\n\r\nIt's been years and I'm rusty!\r\n"
