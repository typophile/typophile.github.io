body: Is it possible in FontLab to generate a new .nam file (name<>unicode mapping
  list) from an existing font?

  body: "I don\u2019t think so, but you can generate your font or take an existing
    one and decompile the cmap table of that font with ttx. Then you have to edit
    it a bit and make it compatible to the nam file syntax. (I have already done that
    and it works.)"

    us?

  body: You can generate .nam file directly from FontForge (albeit I'm not able to
    force FLS to read this file :(

  body: "@ JanekZ\r\n\r\nBut the FontForge nam file, that I just have exported, looks
    almost compatible to FontLab\u2019s nam files. You probably only have to add the
    following two lines at the top:\r\n\r\n%%FONTLAB NAMETABLE: eliason\r\n% FontLab
    nametable eliason"

    at <strong><a href=\"http://www.geocities.jp/meir000/fontforge/\">http://www.geocities.jp/meir000/fontforge</a></strong>.
    You start it with the included batch file (fontforge.bat)."

  body: "I successfully generated a .nam file, but it doesn't include the double encodings
    I had in the font. Don't know if they're getting lost when FontForge opens the
    font, or when it creates the file...\r\n\r\n(This is admittedly a special case,
    a unicase font that is double-encoded throughout. Preserving this double-encoding
    is precisely what I am trying to do in the first place.)"
