Hello everyone!

I made a new font. I would call it a text font somewhat in the vein of Electra. It has heaps of OpenType features and it supports lots of languages, including Greek and various Cyrillic-alphabet languages (as exotic as Mongolian). 

How does it look? I could especially use critique on the Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, but all critique will be useful for me.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,
my (dilettante) impression: cyrilic roman: UC "Pe" a bit too wide, lc "yeru" (61) a bit too loose
cyrilic italic UC "Pe" again too wide, "ze" too narrow, "zhe" too dark and it doesn't suit your design (vide "Lazurski" type)
Very nice design!
Best
J

Besides those little things, I also designed some old-style figures. There's a new pdf up top. Anyone have any thoughts? Are any of my letters too distracting? I feel like I might be pushing it with some of them, like perhaps /a/, so it'd be good to know if someone else thinks they all work okay. I'm open to opinions about the disconnected bowls on B, P, and their Russian and Greek kin. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is looking good. /a/ works for me. I think roman /W/ is splayed too wide (I'd make the bottom vertices closer together), and /y/'s tail is a bit too long for my taste (maybe /j/'s too, but maybe not). 
I wonder if the bracketing on the serifs on the thick strokes should be trimmed back a bit, particularly on the capitals - to my eye, you're getting some dark spots there. 
I think the disconnected bowls in the Latin work fine. /R/ (like /K/) has some sassiness to it which it would be neat to see work. Right now, it (/R/) might be a little dark overall.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Alright! I'm back.

Since the last post I've done lots and lots of work on Walleye. I've created a bold and bold italic, and I've made what's needed for supporting polytonic Greek, and I've coded many OpenType features, and I've done some rethinking of various characters. It's all shown in the new specimen that I'm attaching at the top (WalleyeBig.pdf). 

What do you think of this? I have to admit that when I started this two years ago, I didn't think it would get to be nearly this big of a project. I also didn't do any serious research into readability, Cyrillic design, or the history of the Greek alphabet. All my learning was done on the fly. So it's a miracle if there are no glaring mistakes in this font. 

One of my big fears is that the design itself is too weak and I should've waited until I had a stronger idea before sinking two years of my font designing energy into this project. Yet I'm this deep already, so I might as well polish it into something usable. Don't be afraid to offer rather sweeping criticisms. 

As before, I'm hoping especially for someone to let me know whether my Cyrillic and Greek alphabets are just totally way off, since I don't actually fluently read those alphabets. But I would also really appreciate any and all comments.

Thanks a bundle for looking!</div>

The challenge you've set for yourself particularly in the italic is summed up in the cap /S/. How do you work together the more "typographic" details with the "pennish" qualities like those thick blunt unseriffed terminals that you want? In the italic /S/ it starts with a "typographic" terminal serif at the top right, then switches gears around the first bend and becomes looser and more "written" looking. Maybe this ambivalent character is what Hrant is seeing as "unhappy." That /S/ is a little Frankensteiny.
Perhaps the cap italic serifs should try on a less formal form?

Italic /Q/ (full-size and small caps) tail may be a touch too dark.

I love the italic /Y/!

Is italic /H/ a touch too wide?

I would try revising all your cap /M/s to give more space to the lower side counters and less to the upper middle counter. This looks especially strange in italic small cap /M/ but might need addressing in the other forms too.

Superscript/subscript figures could be bigger to make them easier to read.

I'm not confident enough in the alphabets to offer critique of the Cyrillic and Greek (though I will say that I see dark spots caused by your italic /ж/).  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Very nice looking and cross-language consistent!  I don't read or speak any languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet, so in practice this may not be a problem, but I find that the very thin horizontal strokes combined with the tight letter spacing makes combinations of two or more instances of  Tse, Dzhe, Sha, and Shcha confusing. They all seem to run together as a series of IIIII's.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments! It's good to know it's an okay design. I think familiarity has been breeding contempt for me lately. 

Hrant, when you said the italic was unhappy, my first thought was this: Maybe you're picking up on the detailing of the lead-in serifs for lowercase letters. In the roman those strokes are all convex, but in the italic I've somewhat inexplicably made them concave. I think convex looks more optimistic. But I've been thinking concave might actually fit better with the design, so I've started considering changing the whole roman to concave serifs. I haven't mocked that up yet, but when I do I'll post it here.

But it could be you're seeing what Eliason is seeing. Eliason, I hadn't thought of changing the italic serifs, but it's an interesting idea. I'm just having trouble picturing it in a way that would leave the italic looking like it's still related to the roman. I kind of have this thing where all the italics I design are very different from the romans, so I always cling to every remnant of similarity they have so they won't look like I just made two different fonts. The capitals are where those similarities abound most. If I can't get a different serif to work, maybe I can fix the S by making the banner less prominent (shorter, a bit thinner on the right).

I'll work on the Q and M, and take a look at the H (I actually thought it might be too narrow). And I'll check out the italic ж and the general spacing of the roman Cyrillic. I should study up on italic ж's.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">New pdfs at the top—WalleyeBig2.pdf and Stannum.pdf. In Stannum, I try out a slightly different S (probably not changed in the right direction, I'll keep thinking about this) and /hmn/ with deeper arches. 

WalleyeBig2 shows everything. Things I've changed since last time:
—Evened out the white spaces inside all the /M/s.
—Added contextual alternate for f before things that come above x-height and shouldn't be collided with.
—Fixed old-style figures' heights so they're all on a level with small caps. For some reason I had them all miscellaneous.
—Lightened tail of the /Q/s.
—Enlarged sups, infs, numr, dnom.
—Shrank all the serifs on the vertical-stem-based Cyrillic letters, after discovering that they were alarmingly big and flappy. Relatedly, spaced these letters out a little looser. 
—Changed xi and ж. Looking better?
—Changed the methods of the gj, jj, <cite>gf</cite>, and <cite>jf</cite> ligatures. Now the second letter is replaced with a special alternate that's made to fit with the preceding one. So now it's handled through calt.
—Various tweaks here and there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,

I had a glance at the Greek and it looks very well done! I think your uppercase letters seem absolutely fine.

For the lowercase, the only things that stood out for me are:
<ul>
<li>I found the "bar" (?) on the "ε" (epsilon)a bit too sharp and too contrasted to the weight of the rest of the glyph.</li>
<li>The "κ" (kapa) is too open at the top. Would consider closing it up a bit.</li>
<li>The left descender of the "χ" (chi) seems a bit heavy and too low. The whole glyph feels biased to the left. </li>
</ul>

Hope this helps!

What seems to catch everyone is the kappa. I went back to it and tried making it in some different ways. Am I on the right track with any of these? The first one is the original.

I've done some work on the chi too. For the epsilon, did you mean the top, middle, or bottom bar?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Alright, I'm back (see WalleyeBig3.pdf up top), and I've kerned. I think I've also finally solved the kappa problem. I improved a few other Greek characters too, including but not limited to the ones Giorgos and Praitsidis mentioned. I think I'm juuuust about done with this font, but I still would like critiques of what I might have left to do, and of the kerning if you notice anything wonky.

The other two fonts I've made are being sold through Veer, but Veer isn't taking on new fonts anymore, and anyway they don't really target a diverse-language market. Does anyone have an idea of what company I could best sell Walleye through? By default I thought of MyFonts, but I don't really know a lot about what else is out there. (I kind of just hunch over my computer and move pixels around without thinking a lot about the market.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking great. Some random observations:
Where acute accents are followed by ascending stems it gets a little crowded.
Italic /p/ is too heavy along the mean line.
In the roman, is /hy/ kerning too loose? Is /Wa/ kerning too tight? Have you done caps to caps kerning? In the string of italic capitals it seems rather uneven (e.g. /R/ looks closer to /S/ than /Q/, /G/ looks closer to /F/ than /H/). 
Any way to open up the lower counter of bold roman /k/? Maybe trimming back that stem serif?
I still think italic /Q/ tail is too dark, especially in the bold. And/Or its bottom bowl could be another place where you take a little weight off.
You might raise that lovely upper right part of italic /v/w/y/ a hair. Consider raising the top of roman /t/ a touch too.
Bold roman /g/ looks too tall, like it is popping up above the mean line.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments! Sorry I didn't reply—I was a bit burnt out on font stuff. But now (WalleyeBig4.pdf) I've put in most of the changes you suggested, Eliason. (But I forgot to play with raising the top of roman /t/ until I'd already made this pdf, and didn't want to generate the font and pdf again.) Good catches.

I might need to lighten the bold italic Q tail still more. And I might have a little work left to do on all-caps kerning. I didn't really put much all-caps text in the specimen, but if anyone sees any dodginess in the caps stuff that does exist, feel free to call it out. 

I couldn't figure out any good solution for the í-ascender collision, so I moved the acute a tiny bit and decided it might have to just be a little claustrophobic.

This pdf has a little bit more detail on the faux ligatures, on the character set pages.</div>

At this point I'm not really sure where to turn for advice on the Cyrillics, since my hobbyist's budget wouldn't really fit a professional consultant in it, and I feel odd about contacting a Cyrillic-reading Typophile out of the blue to bug them to take a look at some text font. All I can think to ask is, if no one looking at this reads Cyrillic, does anyone know (of) someone who might welcome such an out-of-the-blue email?

—The leg of the small-cap «R» seems a bit dark to me.
—The top diagonal of the small-cap «K» is hanging a bit too far to the right.
—The bottom opening of small-cap «W» is more open than the lowercase and uppercase versions.
—Crossbar of «H», again the small-cap instance, is somewhat high.
—The shapes of «upsilon» and «psi» can definitely look better, comparing them with what you did with the other greek characters! What you did with the italics looks ad hoc.

—What I really like is the italic-roman relationship and their dissonance in width.
—«X» and «Y» are original, as well as «R».

Overall I think you really achieved a consistent and distinctive design, which are perhaps two of the hardest tasks a typographic designer can strive for. Enviable ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant—unfortunately, by the time ATypI happens, I'll be very far away from both South Korea and Hong Kong. I would like to go to a type conference someday, but I'm just barely getting out of the "poor college student" phase of my life, and into the "vagabond hitchhiker" one, neither of which are very well suited to attending things that are in other continents and/or have an admission fee greater than zero, so I might have to wait a while for the right opportunity.

Lex—Thanks for all the critiques! I think you've caught a lot of holdovers from when I was just starting this project and hadn't learned as much, for instance the w.sc and the upsilon and phi. I'll get on these post haste. As for the upsilon and phi, are the roman ones looking okay while the italic ones are wonky, or do you think the roman ones need to be rethought too? 

It's really good to hear that I'm hitting my target of consistency and distinctiveness. I also think it's interesting that you like the interaction between the roman and the italic, since earlier people were saying the italic was too unhappy for the roman. I'm happy with it too.</div>

I hear from Veer that they're going to start taking on new fonts again soon, so I'm planning on selling it with them and also with MyFonts. It's definitely going to have to get done within the next month, because after that I'm sending my computer to the other side of the planet and forsaking fixed addresses for probably over a year!

I didn't realize it was visible when I put up new files—though I'm not complaining, since I was actually planning on putting up a message to accompany it. I mainly put up WalleyeBig7 because I'm trying to reach out for Cyrillic critique by email, and wanted the most recent changes to be visible on this thread. Cyrillic is the last piece of the Walleye puzzle—I got some great Greek help by email. I haven't heard back about Cyrillic yet, though I just sent the email yesterday (to Alexei Vanyashin who you mentioned—I finally looked him up).

(The "latest changes" that I mentioned are the addition of obsolete Greek characters, and of yet more Greek OpenType features, and the expanding of the Cyrillic Ф vertically as suggested in Alexei Vanyashin's [[http://cyreal.org/archives/681|tutorial on Cyrillic type design]].)</div>

This is awesome. Thanks so much for putting in all this effort. It looks like I have some work to do. I'll post a new sample booklet when I've done it all. I'll probably put up a few images while I'm working, too.

So, for <cite>ЦцЩщ</cite>, I guess the "banner" descender is just too old-fashioned or distracting? I've been wondering about that since I made those.

How necessary are the serifs on italic <cite>гз</cite>? I see a lot of other fonts without serifs on those and it seems like it would be hard to make them look good in Walleye.</div>

<cite>So, for ЦцЩщ, I guess the "banner" descender is just too old-fashioned or distracting? I've been wondering about that since I made those.</cite>

The banner-like <em>ЦцЩщ</em> look very lettering-inspired, 
they just don't fit in a text typeface.
You might leave them as alternates, if you tweek them in a more conventional way 
as in Academy
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/academy_3535.png]

You will need to revise the stroke modulation and extend the shoulder.

<cite>How necessary are the serifs on italic гз? I see a lot of other 
fonts without serifs on those and it seems like it would 
be hard to make them look good in Walleye.</cite>

<em>г</em> doesn't have serifs – you need to extend the terminals
to balance the white space.

Yes, traditionally (in Didone typefaces) /з/ italic has no top serif.
Although, a serif or splayed terminal would fit better in your case, 
considering you have a broad-nib design. Try it.

At long last, Walleye is available. It has all the features that I talked about in this thread, all visible in WalleyeBig8.pdf at the top. It's available through both MyFonts and Veer: 
<a>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/looseleaf-fonts/walleye</a>
<a>http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Walleye-Volume-CTT0000654</a>
Check it out! This is the result of two years of effort, several months of that being rather intense effort, and I'm pretty pleased with the way it came out. I hope you like it too.
