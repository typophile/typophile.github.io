  (if you didn't, you really should) and recognized the typeface used for the end
  titles.

    font as the poster titles?\r\n\r\n--N"

    body: No, they are different, a sans-serif that reminded me of Century Gothic
      or something like that. My searches led me to a company called Scarlet Letters,
      but they also do not have a website.

  body: oh I would like to see them. I don't remember the titles but the departed
    was a cool movie and has excellent music. Good luck!
