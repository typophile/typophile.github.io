  body: "Hi Candy,\r\nthere\u2019s no image.\r\nNeed help? <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18067\">How
    to post a sample or image</a>\r\nIn particular, make sure that:\r\n<ul><li>the
    file name does not contain spaces (or any other \xF8\u2202\u2202 \xA2h\xE5r\xE6ct\u20ACrs)</li>\r\n<li>you
    have the right <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/\">Flash plugin</a>
    installed with your browser</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe Commerzbank logo used to
    feature a custom bold stressed sans, similar to Optima. The recent redesign brought
    a more contemporary logotype by [[Luc(as) de Groot]], see the <a href=\"http://www.fontblog.de/das-neue-commerzbank-logo\">article
    on Fontblog</a>.\r\nApart from the logo, there\u2019s a corporate typeface based
    on Linotype\u2019s Compatil, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/en/24-19724/corporatetypedownload.html\">Commerzbank
    Compatil</a>. Before that, there was a bold oblique slab called Commerzbank Head.
