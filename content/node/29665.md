body: "Hello,\r\nSorry for double-posting here and on the FL user group\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm
  getting an annoying issue with the way my FontLab and/or my computer handles glyph
  classes in OT panel.\r\n\u2022 The issue:\r\nWhen compiling any vfb OT font that
  has glyph classes imported into the OT panel, systematically, the font won't compile
  and the output panel turns crazy saying repetedly this:\r\n[WARNING] <Fontname>
  Glyph class @Fontname redefined [/User/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio
  5/Features/fontlab.fea 192]\r\n\u2022 If I remove glyph classes from OT panel (but
  keep them in classes panel) it compiles fine\r\n\u2022 I trashed everything FontLab
  and resinstalled and still it doesn't work\r\n\u2022 Tried also on my computer with
  FLS5.0.3b1 and still it doesn't work\r\n\u2022 I tried another user account and
  still it doesn't work\r\n\u2022 On another computer, running FLS5.0.2 or FLS5.0.3b1
  (MacIntel) it compiles + works fine\r\n\r\nI fear this might not be FL-related and
  rather be some corruption of system-level Python, but I'm really not sure (as I'm
  really not confident in reinstalling my system)\r\n\r\nFLSM5.0.2 OSX.4.8 on PPCG5"

    just getting the warnings, or are you getting the warnings *and* the font does
    not compile? It's a big difference. \r\n\r\n2. If you define your classes both
    in the Classes panel and in the OpenType panel, then of course it is logical that
    FontLab Studio will warn you that your classes are defined twice (hence, \"redefined\").
    \r\n\r\nIf you prefer to use the class definitions from the Classes panel, then
    there is no reason of keeping them in the OpenType panel. \r\n\r\nIf you prefer
    to use the class definitions from the OpenType panel rather than from the Classes
    panel, set the appropriate option in Preferences (i.e. disable General / Unicode
    and OpenType / Add all glyph classes...). \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Hello Adam,\r\nThanks for input. In the meanwhile I got some feeback from
    Karsten and Alex Petrov, and you all told the same so it's fine :)\r\nto answer
    to you, even if it's been solved since:\r\n1. I get the warnings but the font
    compiles, feature works and so on.\r\n2. Yeah that's what I've been told. Actually
    the issue came that I used  method 1 (classes from classes panel, not in OT panel)
    and another configuration used method 2 (\"text-editable\" classes from OT panel)
    so one could not generate from the other's vfb\u2026\r\n\r\nSo switching either
    on or off the option was the definite solution. It's a weird thing to have this
    cross-action possibility, but it seems that classes in OT panel were a workaround
    in previous versions of FL, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nAnyway, on another subject: when
    I tried to replicate the same FL config on 2 computers, I also copied the plist
    preference file, that's why I didn't check in-depth the FL preferences window.
    But somehow plist file doesn't handle *every* aspect of FL's preferences window,
    does it?\r\n\r\nThanks for help anyway,\r\nJB"

    wasn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nNo, not really. If you use classes in the OpenType panel
    only, you can use all the aspects that the AFDKO syntax allows you, for example
    have classes that include classes, e.g.: \r\n\r\n@LETTERS = [@UC @LC @SC]; \r\n\r\nThis
    is not possible in the Classes panel. On the other hand, the Classes panel gives
    you integration with some UI elements in the Metrics Window (the little flyouts,
    the blue buttons in the Kerning table etc.) which you don't get when you use classes
    in the OpenType panel. I don't think it's really possible to completely merge
    those two paradigms since the one is more an engineer's, the other more a designer's
    view. \r\n\r\nI for my part work in the way that I use the Classes panel for Metrics
    and Kerning classes only, while I directly specify classes in the OpenType panel
    for use in other OpenType Layout features. Since there is no overlap between these
    two sets in my case, I keep the \"Add all glyph classes...\" option enabled. \r\n\r\n>
    I also copied the plist preference file\r\n\r\nThe supported way of backing up
    and exchanging preference files is by using the \"Save\" and \"Open\" buttons
    in the Preferences dialog. This will produce a .reg file which is cross-platform
    compatible between the Mac and the Windows versions of FontLab Studio. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    about preferences. RTFM applies here I suppose :)\r\n(btw, opening the .reg files
    shows some interesting infos! but no xml though)\r\nThis raises other issues,
    but a new topic will be more appropriate."

  body: "Jean Baptiste, \r\n\r\nthe .reg format is the Windows Registry format --
    something like .plist but on Windows. Since FontLab Studio is originally developed
    on Windows, some of the native data structures are tied to the Windows architecture
    and then replicated on a Mac through some translation. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
