  body: Yves are you sure its a font the h and y are the same character flippedand
    the a and p are the same with the back of the a shortened. I would guess you could
    draw this pretty easily in Illustrator or equal.

  body: hmmm, could be possible that this is hand-made, yes. but might it be derivated
    from another known font? maybe someone created a new font, cause it is used in
    other words too... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56202.jpg"
