body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nMy associate and I were recently called upon to design a new
  set of identity for a property and retail project , which covers a new logo and
  logotype, as well as a series of A&P materials.  After we studied the problems we
  arrived at the conclusion that the solution to this project is a new family of display
  fonts, which would empower the new identity with strong and unique characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe
  brief did not specifically required us to design a customized font but client likes
  our idea of designing the new fonts. We have shown them the first draft and they
  loved it, and they agreed the fonts do solve their problems.\r\n\r\nNow, the challenge
  we are facing is this: We need to pen it down in B&W on our contract to the client,
  telling them that since their brief and budget did not cover the exclusive right
  over the fonts, we therefore as designers and creators of the fonts own the exclusive
  right over the fonts. In another word we have the freedom to do whatever we like
  with the font in future and the client has no say over this. They cannot complain
  nor take any legal action against us if they happen to see the fonts being used
  in other projects in future, or that the fonts being released on a foundry and worse
  still, someone bought it and ended up using it on one of their competitors.\r\n\r\nOur
  problem now is how to term this in a short and precise language (in English of course)
  at the same time appears to be professional and legally sound, not too lengthy nor
  amateurish. We have no problem explaining this to them verbally and they can understand
  that, but we still need a B&W on the contract.\r\n\r\nOk, I know what some of you
  are thinking: \"why don't you go to your lawyer instead?\" Yes, we can, but we prefer
  that to be the last resort, mainly due to budget constrain. Most lawyers in this
  country don't understand the business of font design, they would end up spending
  hours listening and researching (and we have to pay for that). On top of that, they
  might not get it right in the end and meetings would have to be called for and many
  rounds of revisions have to be done... all in all, it would cost us a bomb!\r\n\r\nCan
  any of you who have had similar experience and kind enough just to give us some
  ideas so that we can kick start on this? (meanwhile we are also googling and searching
  for some samples/templates available on line)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nweng"

    suggestion of the exact words what to write instead of ideas of how to cut a deal
    with them. we are pretty sure the quotation won't include the exclusivity and
    they would never pay for that. We don't even bother to travel down that direction
    to start any negotiation. We call the shot on this, not them. We just have to
    put it down in B&W and they would agree.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've made some commissioned typefaces, and my SOP is three years exclusive
    license, and after that it's mine to distribute. It gives the client time to establish
    the brand, and in that sense own the type. Most clients are fine with that. Two
    wanted five years, and I went with that after negotiating the price. There were
    some who wanted all rights, for which I tripled the quote. One declined, but the
    rest were suddenly happy with three years.

  body: "Terminaldesign-\r\n\r\nThanks for the link. It's indeed a bliss to know there's
    such a law firm for such niche industry. I would consider their service in future,
    but not for this particular project though.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, we are not cheapskate.
    \r\n\r\nWe are often the victims of cheapskate and we fully understand the pain
    of being one. The world doesn't need another cheapskate and we work hard not to
    be one and we believe we are not one. We have invested thousands in licienced
    fonts for our studio and blow people head off with M16 whenever we see them copying
    fonts without observing the right. We have purchased fonts from almost every major
    font foundry- FF, ITC, Emigre, T-26, ...you name it, we got it. You can reserve
    your preaching for the truly guilty.\r\n\r\nWe handle big corporations all the
    time, some are international clients, and we read our local clients pretty well,
    and I think we pretty much know what we are doing in term of negotiation. It's
    not always that straightforward when you are dealing with a business negotiation.
    Many aspects to be considered but at the same time you got to keep things within
    budget for a project (no matter how big the budget is) and I don't think I need
    to preach to the converted here in regards to this. (I am sorry I am allowed to
    reveal details here. It would lead to unnecessary complications)\r\n\r\nWhat i
    am trying to say is that we have made certain business decisions in regards to
    the project after considering all aspects and we won't be able to undo that. As
    I mentioned earlier, I am looking for suggestions for writing the language, not
    about how to deal with the negotiation.\r\n\r\nI don't mind if some of us want
    to discuss about business negotiation here, but it won't be able to help me much.
    \r\n\r\nAlso bear in mind that we are not talking about running a font business
    here, nor are we being commissioned to design a corporate font. It's an ID project
    which happened to arrive at a new font as a solution- which we knew clearly not
    included in the brief. Otherwise I would prefer to invest in a good legal advisers
    (which we do all the time anyway) in order to get things done in proper way. \r\n\r\nThis
    is an one-off project and it's probably the first in the history of this country
    where a design firm are given the opportunity to design a set of fonts for a client's
    brand ID. (LOL- I know) Things are wired differently in this part of the world
    and font design is DEAD (or rather, it has never really be born) in this country
    and I am one of the very, very, very few rare species who are into font design.
    (again that is another lamentation which I would prefer to share in other time)\r\n\r\nWe
    try to push and advocate font design whenever we can at the same time at the same
    time without compromise too much...\r\n\r\nOK, you can see how these whole things
    are heading. I am trying to start a lengthy discussion on business negotiation
    and I am not looking for one- as I said in the beginning. "
