  body: not exact, but [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cadson-demak/kondolar/|Kondolar
    Italic]] might do it.

  body: Thanks for that info, Herb. I remember when Disney's WWoS got the ESPN makeover
    a few years back, a lot of the signage, etc. changed from [[http://myfonts.us/BWNdSo|City]]
    to this new font, and I wondered if it was related to ESPN. [[http://cubanica.com/portfolio/epsn/|Playoff]]
    (which apparently does have a serif version) certainly seems to match the more
    recent branding.

  body: "The logo as seen in Justin's link appears to be a unique design, with no
    associated independent typeface. The characters themselves look like a serif version
    of Playoff, an ESPN proprietary font family developed by Pablo Medina. They're
    similar (but not the same) as in the Disney World signage for \"Disney's Wide
    World of Sports\"\r\n  - Herb"
