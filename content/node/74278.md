  body: Your eyes are probably better than mine, but compare the lowercase a in the
    two fonts; to my tired, old eyes, they look more like Expanded than New Schoolbook...but,
    as ZZ Top has said, I might be mistaken...

  body: I'd say Century Schoolbook, but the ampersands are from <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bauer-bodoni/?testdrive=src%3Dcustom%26text%3D%2526%26size%3D76%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3DFFFFFF%26w%3D600%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26dock%3Dfalse%26seed%3D26">Bauer
    Bodoni</a>. Kind of an odd combo.
