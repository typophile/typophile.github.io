body: "If, like me, you have wished you could add 3D to your design repertoire, but
  thought the financial expense and, moreover, the investment in learning time was
  too high to make it worthwhile for the few occasions it would be of use, then may
  I suggest...\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Home.2.0.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">Blender</a></strong>\r\n\r\nBlender is <em>\"open source software
  for 3D modeling, animation, rendering, post-production, interactive creation and
  playback. Available for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public
  License.\"</em>\r\n\r\nI thought I didn't have the time or skills to get involved
  with 3D, but discovering the impressive Blender gallery by accident, and then seeing
  the software's relatively small download size, I thought I would take a quick look.\r\n\r\nTo
  my surprise, after a little while fiddling about I had created something that wasn't
  complete crap. Each time I have got stuck on something either a search of Blender's
  comprehensive wiki, a thread on one of the QA forums or a look at one of the video
  tutorials has solved the problem. There are lots of resources, objects, materials,
  textures etc for dowloading too. Obviously, I still have loads to learn, but it's
  very rewarding and nowhere near as hardgoing as I had first feared.\r\n\r\nI'm excited
  about this potential new string to my bow. If I get good enough to use it for a
  design job I will definately donate toward further development.\r\n\r\nHere's some
  related links...\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Gallery.55.0.html\"

  body: My son Tristan, 13 years old, has been using Blender for about 1 year, and,
    with very little help, certainly not from me, has done many very great things
    with it, as well as helping me to learn it a bit. It is an amazing program, but
    for some the menus and submenus etc. might be a bit daunting. There is a learning
    curve here. However, Tristan has done some truly amazing things, to me, like a
    fluid simulation, a car design, etc. The high school he will be attending will
    probably use Blender in conjunction with Maya and 3D Studio Max. At least they
    will use Blender and point the students in that direction while at the same time
    using the other stuff. Seeing Maya in the downloadable learner version I notice
    many similarities between the two programs. My son had the links you've posted
    but not all. Thanks. He is a fast learner. There is certainly a way to use type
    with this program but I'm still learning the basics. The program, while available
    for Macs and PCs definitely requires a fast processor and very good video card.
    My old G3 works but I have to cut the colors from millions to thousands and reduce
    the resolution. Have fun everyone!

  body: Actually, there are some people who combine type and 3D-animation quite effectively
    already. For example, see <a href="http://www.renascent.nl/motion.htm">Renascent.nl</a>.
    For example check 'World of Poetry', 'Offf BCN 06' or 'Devil's Drug' on that site.
    Or the rest, most of it is very beautiful. This is animation, but the same can
    apply for static images, of course.

  body: "I've used 3D Studio Max, and I've tried Blender. 3DSMAX has a very intuitive
    interface - I figured out the basics in less than an hour by just playing around.
    Blender has practically no interface by comparison. It's very tricky to use -
    the sheer number of keyboard shortcuts one must learn is overwhelming. Yes, there
    are lots of resources to help you learn it, but in my opinion if I can't figure
    it out on my own, it's not worth my time.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nNote: I haven't
    looked at Blender in about a year - maybe there have been some improvements -
    let me know if this is the case."

  body: "Lex, I've only been using Blender in the last 2 weeks. I don't know what
    the interface was like when you tried it a year ago so I can't say how it may
    have improved . It does appear to get frequent updates though.\r\n\r\nI've not
    used 3ds Max, but I have watched a friend using it. I thought Max's interface
    looked rather daunting, with lots of cryptic icons, whereas Blender mostly has
    text buttons. I guess it comes down to personal preference.\r\n\r\nYes, Blender
    was designed to be used with one hand on the keyboard for all the shortcuts, but
    you certainly don't have to know them. Just hit W and you get a contextual menu
    with all the relevent options, or hit the Space Bar and you get a menu which has
    all the keyboard shortcut tasks anyway. If you can't figure something out then
    the option will normally be in one of those 2 menus.\r\n\r\nI havn't found Blender's
    learning curve to be that much steeper than other graphics software.\r\n\r\nThere
    is another reason Blender may be worth your time. A new copy of 3ds Max is $3,495
    whereas Blender is free. If your design rate is $50 an hour then that's 70 hours
    work you don't have to do to pay for it. Max's last upgrade was $795, but obviously
    Blender upgrades are free too.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Infinity01b_3956.jpg]"
