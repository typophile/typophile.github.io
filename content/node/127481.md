  Any idea?\r\n\r\nPossibly some variation of Garamond... but which variation?"

    a Garamond).\r\n\r\nIs the source a video, or a website (if the latter, please
    provide the URL).\r\n\r\nPlantin is similar, as is Times:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/plantin/\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/"

  body: "Sorry, but Times is the best match I can find, given the blasted out image.
    An ID of body text is dependent on being able to see details of the serifs, and
    the image is just too indistinct.\r\n\r\n"

    body: I guess what's throwing me off is that it looks like the font is very slightly
      "smeared" (not the best word for it). But it looks like it was actually printed
      or somehow distorted by film. Is this some sort of effect that designers can
      use to achieve that look? Or is there a word for it? I agree, it looks like
      it could be TIMES (maybe Times Ten?) but the serifs are rounder and less sharp
      than what those fonts look like rendered on my screen. That's why I (incorrectly)
      thought it was a Garamond - for some reason fonts like EB Garamond have that
      vintage/old "printed" kind of look to them. Thanks in advance for any insights
      to this.
