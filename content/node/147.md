  body: Ok then. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s an Emigre typeface which &#42;name&#42; makes
    reference to a <BR>famous book written by Aldous Huxley. What&#39;s the name of
    that  <BR>typeface? And what&#39;s the name of the book? <BR>

  body: That&#39;s the right book, but the typeface is wrong. <BR>I don&#39;t think
    the word &#34;citizen&#34; is such a reference <BR>for this book either. <BR>
    <BR>If you know which is the longest river in Africa, <BR>you&#39;ll probably
    figure out the answer to this quiz. <BR> <BR>;-&#41;
