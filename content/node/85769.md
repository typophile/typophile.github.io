body: "Dear typophiles,\r\nI\u2019d like to present here the revised and improved
  version of Novecento, an uppercase-only font family inspired on european typographic
  tendencies between the second half of 19th century and first half of the 20th.\r\nInitially
  offered for free as Novecento Wide, my family has now a condensed, a narrow and
  a regular versions. In addition, extra light and extra bold weights were added.\r\nI\u2019ve
  also added more OT features (12 now) and extra glyphs.\r\nPlease discover Novecento
  font family at [[http://typography.synthview.com]]\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/novecento_0.png\"
