body: "Hello\r\nI am having trouble figuring out what I am doing wrong. I designed
  a script typeface where there is an alternative letter \"s\" for the beginning of
  words and another \"s\" for the end. In FontLab it does work, but when I go to InDesign
  and Illustrator ONLY the initial \"s\" works. Please see image attached where I
  show the way I have written it in Classes and in Open Type windows (please, scroll
  below to see everything). I have to turn this typeface on Monday to my client and
  I am running out of time. Please help!!!!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/help-sb_5706.jpg]"

  body: "I completed a connecting script a few months ago. My first attempts at making
    it more automatic worked but since there are some inherent weaknesses in OpenType
    feature code it would have led to frustration on the part of the end user so I
    abandoned that.\r\n\r\nTo simplify it, I set it up to make using the beginning
    alternate glyphs and the ending alternate glyphs easier for the end user. I used
    the code in a Stylistic Set, as follows:\r\n\r\nFor ending strokes: sub zcaron'
    space by zcaron.fina;\r\nFor beginning strokes: sub space a' by a.init;\r\n\r\nYou
    will have to have a similar line for each alternate glyph you wish to substitute.
    You don't need the /ignore line you currently have. \r\n\r\nYour client must have
    software that supports Stylistic Sets too.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The way to go (which works with FontForge, there should be a way with Fontlab)
    is to give yourself two lookups, one to substitute the first letter, which is
    just\r\n<PRE>\r\nlookup subfirst {\r\n  ignore sub  @LETTER s';\r\n  sub s' by
    s.init;\r\n} subfirst ;\r\n</PRE>\r\nThe second lookup, for the last letter can
    simply take the form\r\n<PRE>\r\nlookup sublast {\r\n  ignore sub @LETTER' @LETTER
    \ ;\r\n  sub s' by s.fina;\r\n  [...]\r\n  sub otilde' by otilde.fina;\r\n  sub
    odieresis' by odieresis.fina;\r\n} sublast;\r\n</PRE>\r\nThe first line says not
    to substitute a letter when followed by a letter. Then you list the substitutions
    for the last letters. Then you simply use the feature calt as follows\r\n<PRE>\r\nfeature
    calt {\r\n    lookup subfirst ;\r\n    lookup sublast  ;\r\n} calt;\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhere
    the first lookup takes care of the first letter, and the second lookup takes care
    of the last letter (they are applied one after the other line by line). Of course
    you need to include in LETTER  s.init if ss may occur at the beginning of a word,
    and maybe other characters. Be careful, there is just one apostrophe per line
    which corresponds to the glyph (or class of glyphs) that is to be substituted.\r\n"

  body: "It would not work without some corrections, for instance for oacute because
    your rule is\r\n<PRE>\r\nsub oacute s' by oacute_s.fina;\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhich asks
    to substitute the final s by oacute_s.fina when preceded by a oacute. You probably
    meant\r\n<PRE>\r\nsub oacute_s' by oacute_s.fina;\r\n</PRE>\r\nThe rule for o_s
    does not have that problem and does not work either. Here is what I would try.
    I would simply put the rules for o_s in a third lookup, that would take o_s and
    replace it with o_s.fina,  otilde_s by otilde_s.fina etc. That would give three
    passes for each line of input text, a first lookup that fixes the initials, a
    second lookup that fixes the final o, b_s w_s etc and a third lookup that fixes
    the o_s etc.\r\n\r\nBe careful. The lookups are the actual code that is executed.
    If you want the three lookups to be executed in some order,  you need to put them
    in that order in your feature file. The order they are listed in calt is irrelevant.\r\n"
