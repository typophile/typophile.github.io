  'r e ' combo, It doesnt change, I still have a huge hole between the two. Help!

  body: Eric, how are you building your kerning? Is it a traditional AFM-style kern
    table, or is it a kern feature?

    some particular operating system that you're testing the font on? If so, please
    kindly specify. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: Testing in InDesign CS2 on osx.4. More specifically ' kerning pair' adjustment
    doesn't seem to change, visually. I re-export under a diff file name, just to
    make sure fontbook isn't picking up the old one, turn off the old one, activate
    the new one. I've almost got my 'r e' combo nested 'in the metrics window Kerning
    pair mode." Nothing. Wait, maybe it was OT. Does that matter?

  body: "Eric, a trick I do when developing fonts is to stick the date in the name,
    as well as a version number, if I'm going to be generating several fonts per day.
    So, a font generated today would be \"Fontname-Test2006020301\". I also change
    the version number, and make sure that all of the name fields in all of the many
    FontLab windows are updated with the right name.\r\n\r\nCache-clearing is a good
    idea. Also, delete all of your AdobeFntXX.lst files, and Log Out and In, or restart.
    (Every once in a while. You don't need to restart every time...)\r\n\r\nIf you're
    working with OT, make sure that you don't have conflicting kerns; it could be
    that you have a kern feature which is battling with a kern table."

  body: "Hello. This is my first posting. I created some unicode fonts in fontlab,
    made kerning pairs, and after reading all the entries on this topic, and trying
    it all, my custom kerning pairs still don't come up in indesign or photoshop.
    I'd go back to fontographer but it doesn't support unicode!\r\nI hope someone
    reads this and can help!\r\nCivi"
