  for my graphic design class.  So far my ideas have been put down by my professor
  and I have nothing to really go on but my logo which I included below.  Can someone
  give me some tips on how to make a book series work well and maybe some reference
  of ones that already do work well.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nIsa  "
