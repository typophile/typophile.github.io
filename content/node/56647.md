body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nJust to let you know the new independent foundry 'Colophon'
  is now open.\r\nWe have three typefaces available at the moment.\r\n\r\nPeggs\r\n\u2013\r\nUsing
  old typewriter fonts as a reference, a new typewriter-esque font was created. Initially
  created in a bold weight for the identity of 'Peggs & son.' (Not for commercial
  usage), the typeface was lightened to a regular weight and an extended character
  set created.\r\n\r\nUsing the crassness of printed typewriter faces, certain bowls
  of the letterforms don't connect to create a unique attribute to the typeface.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerfin\r\n\u2013\r\nAlison
  Haigh designed Perfin in 2008. Perfins or 'Perforated Initials' first appeared on
  postage stamps in 1868. Companies perforated text and symbols into their stamps
  to protect them from theft. The use of perforations meant there was no need to overprint
  onto the stamp image. Perfin was created based on the letterforms seen on these
  stamps, and is a clear, versatile display typeface.\r\n\r\n\r\nReader\r\n\u2013\r\nReader
  is a neo\u2013grotesque typeface created in a medium weight. The typeface itself
  has been referenced from an RSPB letter dating 1972. The original typeface, which
  is unknown, was a monospaced, rounded face. It had geometric proportions which felt
  like they wanted to break free of the restrictions of a monospaced grid.\r\n\r\nThe
  construction and geometric properties from this type were taken into the sketching
  process of Reader but without the monospaced grid. The proportions of the typeface
  were rebalanced to give it a neo-grotesque, 1960's swiss style feel, but also referencing
  the symmetry and geometry of the bauhaus.\r\n\r\nWeight has also been added to the
  face, giving a subtle stress to the characters and allowing easy readability. The
  ends of every stem, originally rounded, have been cut off, replaced with horizontal
  and angled edges to allow for evenly spaced typesetting.\r\n\r\nThe name takes itself
  from the original reference of whom the letter is addressed to \u2013 Reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  go over to http://www.colophon-foundry.org\r\n\r\nand let us know what you think!\r\n\r\nWarmest,\r\n\r\nColophon
  Foundry"
