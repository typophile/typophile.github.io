		<div class="commentbody">David, any question can be considered on various levels. This particular question does make sense on a certain level. Think for example of a low-res bitmap font, or an abstract futuristic design. In some cases I can see the monocular /g and the /9 being distinguished only by the former having a sharp top-right and the latter a soft one.

BTW, I handwrite my /9 with a top-right stub, and many people misread it as a "g".

		<div class="commentbody">@Hrant: If we relied on your definition of lower case g and the difference between it and the number 9 the world would stop turning. Wonderful Hrant, I don't know what I would have done if I had remained on those hot coals burning my pretty flesh."In some cases I can see the monocular /g and the /9 being distinguished only by the former having a sharp top-right and the latter a soft one." If that's all you can offer as an example it makes me wonder how small your brain is. What about the curving tail of a 9 contrasted with the straight back stem of a single story g? A competent type designer would have mentioned that. Low res bitmap fonts and futurist abstract fonts don't count for diddley poo. How often do they get used?

@Ryan: the number 9 is typically drawn with a huge great oculus or bowl, whereas lower case g is drawn with a smaller bowl and larger stem and tail in proportion. The biggest giveaway is context. Who puts a number nine in the middle of words in place of lower case g's? Only a moron would do that. The 2 glyphs are distinguished by context, okay honey? The letters to the left and the right define them as g's. Let's look at an example. "Aggravated assault" Lookee yar, Ryan Maelhorn wonders if the 2 glyphs after "A" are g's or number 9's. Ryan, when you type the word "aggravated", do you put nines in there instead of g's? You know the answers to all of these questions already, and you are only here asking typophile to get attention. If you're going to be a typographer I would expect you to see these basic truths as self-evident, with no need to ask what the difference is. But you allow your silly ego to get in the way of common sense. Happy happy, joy joy.</div>

Anyone remember that 1995 film with Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in it? I think it was called <strong>Se7en</strong>. Everyone seemed to "get it" at the time despite the juxtaposition of letters and numbers and, although I have a bit of a jaded view about marketing types, I am fairly sure they weren't <em>all</em> morons.</div>

Here's how I roll: a (mono) /g is a blob with something coming down the right half, shifting leftward (so it's not a /q). A /9 is a blob with something coming down, preferably not left of center (even center is fine). If you're going to mix alphabetics and numerics (like in a username, password or TinyURL, so not crazy) then you want a singularity on the blob of the /g, preferably towards the top-right. BTW, [mis]alignment does not qualitatively disambiguate.

Interestingly, for me when I print, my 9 and q are indistinguishable:

Context and baseline are the only way to tell them apart... I never noticed.

I've know for a long time my 2 and z are exactly the same, so I cross the z (and 7, must cross my 7).

- the straight line at the right of the g is attached to a circle, and so extends upwards past the point of contact, while the 9 is basically a single line with a spiral-like shape;

- the bottom of the 9 continues pointing downwards until the end, while that of the g forms a bowl that turns back up;
