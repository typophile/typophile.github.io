  body: Chris, your question falls a bit off the &#39;Type Identification&#39; activity
    of this forum.  Without giving us an idea of the look you want, how do you think
    we can help? My suggestion is to check out DaFonts, or TypeNow.net and don&#39;t
    limit yourself to things with chalk in the name. What you probably want are simple
    hand-printed fonts. Put it as white on green or black and it looks like chalk
    most of the time. <BR> <BR>Of course there are better things if you want to buy
    them, depending on the look you want.

    both free.
