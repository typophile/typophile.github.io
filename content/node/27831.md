body: "hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with a logo for a clothing shop for
  women (mainly at the moment).\r\nMost of the colours of the shop are red and the
  previous logo was the name of the owner in KuenstlerScript.\r\nShe wanted something
  charming with swashes and I think that it does work well with most of clothing she
  sells, however she also (when she has time) likes to design very modern dresses
  and skirts and stuff.\r\n\r\nI asked her if it would be alright if I work on a logo
  for her as a part of a university project, which was fine.\r\n\r\nWell...so I wanted
  to make a modern looking logo which would still have a swash to make it a bit more
  charming and feminine.\r\n\r\nThe logo isn't finished yet but this is just a first
  try and I was wondering what people here thought about it.\r\nI decided for a very
  light font for her name underneath because otherwise it just took too much attention
  away from the logo.\r\nI wanted the format to be able to fit on a tag (the things
  that are in the neck of shirts and stuff...not sure what they are called at the
  moment...(english is not my first language).\r\n\r\nAgain as always ---> thank you
  all so much!\r\ndav2.\r\n\r\n\r\njust made some changes to the whole in logo 4.
  (btw..I changed the size hoping I could add it with 'insert image' but didn't work).\r\nI
  have changed the type also to universe ultra light (I have been looking for different
  very light fonts because anything too bold will pretty much take over the whole
  of the logo)."

    but the \"inner upper curve\" of the f is not entirely aligned with the right
    vertical line of the compounding box (I hope you know what I'm talking about).
    Anyway, just check the upper side of the f where it meets the box, you'll see
    what I'm talking about."

      called 'kate fearnley female boutique', so does that mean I did well!!! =))\r\nor
      was that rather sarcastic? =))\r\n\r\ntnx for the reply...I'm just working on
      tweaking the whole thing a bit...I feel also that the white (red) space is not
      really in balance..."

    & that it fits women's clothing perfectly.

  body: "I don't know which is the first post, but from Lex's comment I am assuming
    logo3 is the original and in terms of the monogram the most successful in terms
    of reading kf. It does need some refining, if you moved the f slightly to the
    right to take advantage of the more horizontal section of the k to make the f's
    crossbar which would also remove the nick from the red box. The bauhaus style
    is not really sympathetic to the logo and seems a bit of an afterthought, as Lex
    suggests you could try a script or you could go for a very simple thin sans (very
    fashion industry), Univers or Eurostile kind of feel maybe. I think your mark
    would look good as an emboss on that deep red. Is the bling version intended to
    be a die-cut which would be tricky even with laser but could look good too?\r\nTim"

  body: I like the one without the box. It has a very nice feel. I think the box is
    too overpowering. The type isn't working.

  body: I've added a updated version..still with the later design though. Added universe
    ultra light (anything bolder would take over the whole of the logo). Aligned the
    'kate fearnley' with the left side of the k to the right side. I've also been
    sketching the first logo loads of times now to make it look more like a handwritten
    autograph, but my drawing capabilities are pretty bad =)  Not sure about the line
    around though, but otherwise it feels a bit like everything is too empty. I'm
    still gonna try and create a more handwritten version, though it will take a bit
    of time, but that was my initial idea.

    body: "Just a couple of versions of the first logo (logo3). I'm starting to feel
      like I'm getting a bit stuck on one thing though at the moment..I like the concept,
      but I don't really know what to do with it anymore..I think I should just go
      back to drawing a bit to see if that could change things a bit more drastic.
      I could also send some off to my teacher, perhaps she has some more feedback
      on it as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo5_5563.jpg]"

  body: The middle top curving letters is also my favourite; but not the placement
    of the name. If it's a clothing store and she ever wants to embroider the thin
    font will be a problem, as well at small sizes.

  body: "I liked the way the characters were integrated in the square in your first
    post's <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/logo3.jpg\">logo3</a>. I mean the
    bottom and top of the F. Althoug the top of the F doesnt align properly. I would
    take that one, to be honest, and put the name under it in a bit more geometrical
    typeface. Like Futura Light or something, and then maybe set in all caps.\r\nJust
    to contrast with the icon, which would complement both the icon and the type.\r\n\r\nBut
    have you considered what happens if you scale the design to very small sizes?
    And what about embroidering the very thin lines?"
