body: "Hello everyone\r\n\r\nI'm doing a job using Helvetica Neue for a client who
  has specified that it should be from the Monotype foundry. On checking my fonts
  (in Quark's utilities) it says what I have used is an Adobe Systems Type 1 Postscript
  font. When I looked online to research about purchasing the Monotype version I keep
  finding it mostly available as either Linotype or Adobe but Monotype is really rare,
  other than from 1 US font site. Certain sites imply that Linotype and Monotype are
  the same so I'm rather confused!!! Are they all different from the 3 foundries?\r\n\r\nIn
  addition I find it very puzzling that there is a Helvetica Neue Roman AND a Helvetica
  Neue 55 (or light and 45 etc) in my drop down font menu as the pairs are each of
  the same or similar weight. Is this because they are from 2 different foundries
  that has mixed up in my system (I use Suitcase Fusion)? Sometimes when I get work
  returned from colleagues having originally used the '55', I find that it's been
  changed to the 'roman' version or vice versa and I need to change it back again.
  I am concerned that if I include the Monotype version it'll add another layer of
  'concern' to this existing one.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is, why do one sometimes see
  the font listed as Neue Helvetica, and Helvetica Neue (reversed order). Other times
  it's spelt as HelveticaNeue with no space between the 2 words and other times there's
  a space. Again is this because they are from different foundries?\r\n\r\nI do love
  this font and would like to clear up these points.\r\n\r\nAny help and advice would
  be thankfully appreciated.\r\n\r\nJade"

    installed in /System/Library/Fonts whereas the Helvetica Neue Roman 55 is the
    one you've installed via Suitcase.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, the Adobe, Linotype, and Monotype
    versions all use the same outline data. I'd double check with the client, though.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thanks for your comment Andr\xE9. I do use a mac and I have read somewhere
    that Helvetica Neue is an OSX systems' font on most if not all versions (mine
    is Snow Leopard). When I've got a moment I'll check in my Library Fonts. I guess
    that still doesn't help with having to change 55 and roman (and the other weights)
    backwards and forwards if other people one works with don't realise the difference.\r\n\r\nSo
    it seems that there are at least 3 foundries (Adobe, Linotype AND Monotype) for
    this font then! I will check back with the client as suggested.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again\r\nJade"

    opportunities as a result (eg a lower price\u2026).\r\n\r\nOh, Monotype and Linotype
    are part of one big firm. "

  body: If Monotype and Linotype are part of 1 big firm does that mean that Helevetica
    Neue from either of these 2 "foundries" is one and the same? I have a copy of
    the Linotype version in my backup disks.
