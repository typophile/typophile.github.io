body: "I have designed a board game and hope to publish within the next year or two.
  One of the major components is cards. The cards are small (3.5 x 2.5) and play a
  large role in the experience. They contain images with some accompanying text outlining
  very important game info. The text is small 5pt being the smallest sometimes reversed
  out of color other times in small boxes. I hope to use only two typefaces and organize
  all the info using weight variations, colors and boxes. The feel of the game I hope
  to obtain is one of high-tech/sci-fi/adventure/superhero. Though beta testers have
  fun playing the game, it is a game of very involved strategy and can get quite complex
  and intricate, thus the target audience would not be children but the 15-30 crowd.
  I hope to balance a friendly look with a serious high-tech look.\r\n\r\nSo far,
  as a crutch I've used Eurostile and Bank Gothic. Bank being used for titles and
  Euro for the rest.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions will be appreciated. Thank you greatly!"

  body: "I find that Vectora works very well in small print, as well as Meta, both
    sans serif. Minion is a good serif in small print.\r\n\r\nYou say that you want
    a friendly look in combination with high-tech. Do you mean the type or the overall
    design? I would advise you to keep the type clear and legible because it is so
    small. If you really want to have a high-tech feel about it, I'd advise you to
    get that from the rest of the design and lay-out. Make any sense?\r\n\r\nKind
    regards,\r\nJean Paul"
