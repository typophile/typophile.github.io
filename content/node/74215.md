    The ampersand seems to be from elsewhere. The web-url is Handel Gothic. \r\n#2
    looks like <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?1ZO0\">Geogrotesque</a> from
    Emtype. \r\n#3: The Slab looks like <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?C75\">Soho</a>
    from Seb Lester. \r\n#4: The multiline looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sparkytype/thri/\">Thri</a>
    from Sparkytype\r\n\r\nDon't know the others \u2026 \r\n\r\nEDIT: Oops, Marc was
    a tad faster. "
