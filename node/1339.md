  body: either the front OR the back of 003.  you can&#39;t have both.  it looks like
    two sketches for one side of a shirt. <BR>for 002, i think the front looks good
    and i think the back looks good, but they dont really belong on the same shirt,
    they&#39;re in different styles... but look good.  how about the back of the shirt
    in a totally different color?
