body: "Alright!\r\n\r\nSo, I've started working on this project with www.hugamug.com,
  an online coffee company who is preparing to revamp their webpage, and would like
  to work on improving their identity at the same time.  The logo is rather outdated,
  and there is very little printed material they use.  I'll be first working on improving
  the logo, then helping to choose some fonts they will continue to use in their marketing
  materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hugamuglogo_4595.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is their current logo, and as you can see, they're using the same font, <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/maiandra/>Maiandra</a>
  for their other places on the webpage.  I'd like to change the font to a more simple
  sans serif font, and first suggested Univers, in a variety of weights, for their
  marketing materials, however the client finds Univers too neutral, and would like
  something that is more unique to the brand, as well as has more 'personality.'\r\n\r\nUltimately,
  the question in more simple terms; what's a good alternative to Univers that has
  more personality.  The client also uses <a href=http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=466>Air
  Millhouse</a> in print, and would like to continue using this.  I like the font
  in some applications, but need to find some other fonts that compliment that as
  well..\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize I've been a bit longwinded here, and possibly a bit
  confusing.  I'm not sure how much help I'll be able to receive here, and I really
  appreciate any responses here.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GiftCard1_3812.jpg]\r\n\r\nTo
  finish things off, here's a recent gift card idea I've started to play around with.
  \ I like the overall design so far, and would like to keep this kind of feeling
  throughout more designs. Feel free to comment on the layout and such here, as I
  can use all the help I can get. =P\r\n\r\nThanks so much to anyone who replies,
  I really appreciate the help!\r\n\r\n- Jibran"

    that's a good way to go about it. It'll probably be more meaningful if you were
    to post images of the reworked logo/options and then seek suggestions on the brand
    typography. Otherwise you'd be getting somewhat generic type recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To

    of Univers and work with just the regular one. \r\n\r\nBtw what is the idea behind
    the blister sort of effect? "

    I'm not very far along myself in the development stages.  I'm kind of testing
    the waters as it is, and hopefully will start to get some more ideas up very soon.
    I'll plan to post up some sketches as well as some initial designs in the next
    day or so, in order to kind of give everyone a better idea of what I'm thinking
    of.\r\n\r\n\"It helps to know what size the card is. As it is the colours look

    and colour. I\u2019d drop the Extended and Extra Condensed versions of Univers
    and work with just the regular one.\"\r\n\r\nSorry, the card is going to be digital
    only, probably in sizes between 125px and 500px, which is also the reason for
    the 'blister sort of effect'.  The client showed me some images that he liked,
    all of which included this effect, so I included it.  I definitely agree with
    the variations of the font, I'll narrow that down and post up some future versions
    of that as well.  Unfortunately, the client wants the gift card available as soon
    as possible, therefore before we revamp the identity stuff, so I need to kind
    of plan ahead for that before I can spend much time on the logo.\r\n\r\nI really
    appreciate the comments, I should have some new images up soon.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hi there. I Jibran is off to a good start. A couple of suggestions:\r\n-Drinking
    coffee is a warm and comforting thing, as is suggested by the name \"hugamug\".
    Although your new logo may express this in a more subtle way than the original
    logo, I believe it is an important message to get across. Perhaps the choice of
    typeface will convey some of this warmth.\r\n\r\n-For the gift card, I am assuming
    it will be double-sided so I would find out if you need to leave room for any
    of the following:\r\n(bar code, disclaimer, URL, contact info, etc)\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n\r\n"

    company with a name like that. You trying to turn them into Starbucks or something?
    \r\n\r\nThe first thing in a re-design shouldn't be, \"What can I scrap,\" it
    should be, \"What should KEEP.\"\r\n\r\nBefore scrapping the old idea completely,
    try re-configuring the usage of the old tyepface. Perhaps matching that really
    loose typeface with something tighter, but cleaner. I'm thinking something like
    Cronos Pro from Adobe. Something clean, but with some of the edge taken off.\r\n\r\nOr
    go the opposite direction, and bump up Maiandra up to the black weight. Black=coffee?
    You'll certainly have a unique identity that is warm and huggable."
