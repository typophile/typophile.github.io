body: "Short story: A while ago, MyFonts offered what appeared to be a quality font
  at a bargain price so I bought it. It looked good on their website, but absolutely
  dreadful when printed. It turned out that the font had zero kerning pairs! I suggested
  to MyFonts that they include the number of kerning pairs in their \"Tech Specs\"
  tab, but they elected not to do so. (The font was so bad I wouldn't have used it
  even if it was free; I eventually got a refund.)\r\n\r\nOne of their \"Rising Stars\"
  this month was offered at a 50% discount, so I wrote and asked \"How many kerning
  pairs (on average) does Mikado have? None? Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?\" This was
  their response: \"Unfortunately, we are not aware of the kerning pair data for the
  Mikado font.\"\r\n\r\nSo I wrote back: \"Shame on you. I downloaded the free font,
  and found that there were over 1000 kerning pairs. Would that have been so hard
  for you to do? Do you need me to recommend a font program to view the number of
  kerning pairs?\"\r\n\r\nTheir response: \"Glad to hear that you now have the kerning
  pair information. The font was also downloaded, and opened in FontBook....\" (No
  kerning pair info.)\r\n\r\nIs it just me, or should a font vendor know, or be able
  to find out, font information more readily than a non-pro? To find out font info,
  I rely on Typograph 5.1.2 available from http://www.neuber.com/typograph/index.html\r\n\r\nWhat's
  with font vendors that profess ignorance of their fonts and do not have the wherewithal
  to find out info?"

  body: "Kerning pairs? That seems to presume old-fashioned kern table kerning, which
    is indeed easy to query. But OpenType fonts are more likely to have GPOS kerning,
    which may be arranged in class kerning, class kerning with exceptions, or pair
    kerning, and may include contextual kerning, contextual interactions between kerning
    and mark positioning, etc.. This information is difficult to query, since that
    would require being able to decompile the GPOS table and to represent the kerning
    data in a meaningful way that would enable comparison across fonts built in different
    ways.\r\n\r\nWhile I would be wary of any (non-monospace) font that contained
    no kerning of any kind, I don't think the actual number of kern pairs -- even
    when this information can be accurately extracted from the font -- is in itself
    a good indicator of quality, and can quite understand why a vendor such as MyFonts
    would consider this unhelpful and potentially misleading information to present
    to customers."

  body: "There are some designers out there making fonts for fun who have never heard
    of spacing. Therefore they build heavy kerning into their fonts to make them halfway
    workable. Would they know just a bit of proper spacing they could save a lot of
    kerning.\r\nSo: the number of kerning pairs is no indicator of quality, as stated
    above."

    Here's a good example:\r\nhttp://vissol.co.uk/mavenpro/\r\nThe guy brags of having
    \"over 6,500 kerning pairs\", but even a cursory look reveals that it's just algorithm
    vomit. I actually emailed the designer about four months ago and got an admission
    that it sucks, but the misleading advertising is still there...\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand there are also designers who pretend a handful of kerning is enough,
    that having thousands is never necessary. This is also bogus.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Just some clarification.\r\n\r\nI never said more kerning pairs were better,
    or an indicator of quality. But I do agree with John: <em>\"I would be wary of
    any (non-monospace) font that contained no kerning of any kind.\"</em> (And recently
    I did unknowingly buy a font that  contained no kerning of any kind.) So the difference
    of zero kerning pairs and 500 is significant; the difference between 4000 and
    6000, not so much.\r\n\r\nMy other point was that I think <strong>all</strong>
    vendors (not just MyFonts) should  be able to get the number of kerning pairs
    either from a font program, or from tech specs that should come with the font,
    or from the type designer. I just can't get over the fact that a company that
    sells fonts can't even tell me if a font has <strong>any</strong> kerning or not.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not familiar with font internals, but I would be interested to know, given the
    many variations possible within Open Type, if font programs (like Linotype FontExplorer
    Pro) can discern all or just some of the kerning in OT. The font I just bought
    is OT; Typograph was able to tell me that Mikado had over 1000 kerning pairs,
    although I have no idea if Typograph can discern all the combinations, permutations,
    and possibilities John describes."

    remarked that de Does didn't think that either kerning or ligatures were necessary

    or was changing his mind about that; he (Peter) did say he'd be curious about
    what we came up with. \r\n\r\nNote that a \"version\" of Trinite now costs 1,400

    asked for a comment and received no response. If I do hear from them, I'll let
    you know.\r\n\r\nJust so you know, I like MyFonts. They let me know of updates
    of fonts I've purchased, and if any of my fonts from them become lost or corrupted,
    I can download them again. <strong>But</strong> I have gotten fonts from them
    that didn't work and waited 2 months for a corrected font that never came, got
    a font that was not style-linked, and a font that had few if any kerning pairs,
    if that explains my sometimes apprehensiveness."
