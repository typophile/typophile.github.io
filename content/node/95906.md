  child-handwriting fonts, or any kind of schoolbook font that is designed to be easy
  to read necessarily, but display fonts that look like they belong on kid products.

    yeah I know the serif is <em>really</em> different from the other two, lol.  But
    if you just think of it in terms of line.."

    if you like the Dr. Seuss look, why not hand-letter it?"

    The Yahoo! logo, for instance.

  body: If you're not looking for a child-handwriting font, I would have felt that
    by age ten, normal typefaces are appropriate - Franklin Gothic, or Venus Extrabold
    Extended, for example.

    an act. However, since this is a typographic forum and not a performance art venue,
    I suggest that you polish your shtick somewhere else, where your efforts will
    be better appreciated. From my personal experience, I can tell you that the Craigslist
    Philosophy Forum has some pretty stiff competition\u2026"
