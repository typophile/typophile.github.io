  body: "Hi Thomas\r\n\r\nOdeon Condensed comes pretty close. I think it was produced
    by Hoefler & Frere Jones, but seemingly no longer available (http://typophile.com/node/13735).\r\n\r\nAlso
    the old Grotesque Condensed No.77 (Monotype, Stephenson Blake) which, like the
    Agency Gothic, has a high square bowl on the 'R' and a stepped (almost horizontal)
    spine on the 'S'. Also (like Agency) it has an 'M' in which the centre strokes
    descend to the baseline \u2013 which is unlike your example from Prague. However
    it may not be available as a digital face.\r\n\r\nI think Neville Brody's <a/href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.108002.0.0\">Industria
    </a> does the same thing with the stepped midsection of the 'S' and it does have
    a high centrepoint in the 'M'.\r\n\r\nStephen - while you're mentioning Bee, do
    you know what is the relation between URW Bee and Binder Style (which might have
    been by Joseph Binder 1959 for D Stempel AG)? \r\n\r\nI thought they were the
    same face... but I could be wrooong : 0"

  body: "Nice one Mike \u2013 Raleigh Gothic with that BOX for a bowl on the 'R'.
    I should have twigged that connection the moment Stephen posted 'Herald Gothic'.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I should have been referring to a Josef Binder in my earlier post - and I'm pretty
    sure that there's a version of URW Bee going by the name of Gallileo. Anyone care
    to corroborate this?"

  body: "Ben - I can tell you, thanks to Philippe on the MyFonts Forum, the derivation
    of the Bee naming. This came from the old VGC aphanumeric naming. The URW Bee
    fonts correspond to VGC's B-1, B-2, B-3 and B-4. There were heavier weights up
    through, I think, B-11. I know of no digital version of the heavier weights.\r\n\r\nThese
    VGC types were themselves copies of someone else's type (I wish I knew what foundry)
    - which had 'G' names like, respectively, Galaxy, Gable, Garfield, and Gamma (and
    so on for heavier weights).\r\n\r\nNote that these are NOT the same as Binder
    Style/Binderstile. Just take a look at the \"corners\" of any rounded character
    and you'll see that Binderstile is considerably more squared off."

  body: "Wow. Thank you Mike (and Philipe) for your research. That had bee puzzling
    me for years...!\r\n\r\nApart from the rounded corners, I presume that the structure
    (stepped midsection 'S', boxed bowl and straight high leg for 'R') is very much
    the same as both Binder Style and the Prague street signage?"

  body: "General structure I suppose is the same. As far as similarity to the street
    signage goes, Binderstile would be closer and is available digitally in two weights
    both from <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\" target=\"_blank\">Castcraft/Opti</a>
    (I'm told) and from QBF as the old Brendel fonts Report Light and <a href=\"http://www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=dc.gif/Sdc02529.gif\"
    target=\"_blank\">Report Bold</a>. As you can sort of make out from the crappy
    showing, Binderstile still has lots of differences, including that R and an M
    that is, like all the other fonts mentioned, nowhere close.\r\n\r\nThe only thing
    I find in predigital catalogs that was quite close to the signage (based though
    on a very limited showing - but that R is there) is something called Enge Wotan
    - and I know of no digital version. Anyone have a decent showing?"

  body: "Hey Mike. Ah yes - it's that wacky lowered crossbar on the 't' and the 'f'
    that is the distinguishing feature for the Binderstile. Thanks for the reference.
    In that the street signs are all caps, this might work for Thomas.\r\n\r\nMy reference
    (Jaspert's Encyclopedia of Typefaces 1958) for Wotan Bold Condensed (and perhaps
    <em> not </em> the same as Enge Wotan) shows a face that is similar to the 'R'
    only; the 'A' and the 'M' are quite different to the Prague street signage.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wotan_ref_4824.jpg]"
