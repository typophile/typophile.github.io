body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any pointers on this monogram I created (based
  on Bickham Script)? I created a 'custom' ampersand based on a Capital E because
  I didn't like the original in the face (and it didn't really fit in the design).\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "in my opinion the top two ideas are the strongest, elegant without looking
    old\r\n\r\nhowever the first thing i read is W O P, when i assume it should read
    W & P, perhaps look at the spacing between the W and P, or alter the flourishes
    so they don't overlap as much and don't create an O shape?\r\n\r\nwould also suggest
    you take another look at the colour, the green you've used gives the monogram
    a cosmetics product feel\r\n\r\nhope that helps"

  body: "Definitely top left. Nice and clean and simple. Make sure to give it lots
    of white space when you use it on anything like your invitation/programs/thank
    you cards/etc. If it were me, I'd play around with the color a bit more, but that's
    only personal taste. I get more of a 90s feel from that kind of green. But as
    long as there's no pink in the wedding too, it should be fine :)\r\n\r\npenn"

    on that right W swash - it looks a bit awkward.\r\n\r\n- Filip \u0141ysyszyn"

  body: "Nice. The only thing that bugs me a bit is the slash through the \u201Cand\u201D
    symbol. It sticks out to me because it is the only straight line in the mark.
    I think a \u201C&\u201D might mesh a little better. "

  body: "Thanks all,\r\n\r\nThe different versions wern't really meant as 'versions'
    more as applications of the same mark. The main mark is the one top-left.\r\n\r\n@
    Peter; I don't think that O you're seeing is a real problem. Most will know our
    initials and would be less quick in thinking there's an O in there. \r\n\r\n@
    Peter & Penn; The color isn't set in stone yet and I've yet to see it printed.
    I was looking for a nice greyish green, but I agree this might give it a soaplabel
    feel.\r\n\r\n@ Filip; The top-right swash of the W is the bottom swash of the
    P but mirrored. I had tried to give the mark some balance with it, but I can see
    it isn't working 100% yet.\r\n\r\n@ Ed; I had started out with an '&' in the mark,
    but it made it feel crowded (and I really dislike the ampersand in Bickham). I
    also tried a more curved line through the E, but that (to me at least) stood out
    even more, as now the line repeats the straight lines of the W.\r\n\r\nI will
    play around with the color and the top-right swash of the W. Again, thank you
    all for commenting."
