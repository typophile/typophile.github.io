    one of the bolder weights of \u2018Heineken Serif\u2019, the corporate typeface
    Lucas de Groot designed for the eponymous Dutch brewery. I\u2019m not sure about
    the legal status of the free font. Decide for yourself if you find it ethical
    to use it!"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HeinekenWordmark_6587.jpg]\r\nMy information
    is that Alfred Henry Heineken, grandson of the founder,  helped develop the wordmark.
    Note that _e_ has an angled crossbar which suggests an open, i.e. \"friendly\"
    style appropriate to beer drinking. The friendly style is continued in the italic
    style right hand terminals for the n, and the soft rounded outlines of the font\r\nAs
    for the \"Heineken\" free font, I believe it was developed by a Dutch Heineken
    fan -- known only as Shamrock -- from the wordmark rather than from the corporate
    fonts developed by Lucas de Groot [LDG]. In support of this view I note at least
    three major differences between the LDG and Shamrock letter-forms. 1. _Q_ In LDG
    _Q_ has a simple tail that does not cross into the counter. In Shamrock _Q_ has
    a florid tail that swirls up into the counter. 2. _g_ In LDG _g_ is single story.
    In Shamrock _g_ is two story. 3. _r_ In LDG _r_ has a ball terminal that flows
    into the stroke. In Shamrock _r_ has a boxy terminal. Both designs are based on
    very conventional letter-forms that are the logical extension of the wordmark.\r\nI
    do see a problem in using the \"Heineken\" free font. The name may infringe the
    Heineken wordmark or trademark. In other cases where fans have made fonts based
    on logos they have taken the precaution of changing the name of the font. For
    example the Coca Cola logo was used as the starting point for a font, but the
    font is named Loki-Cola.\r\nDisclaimer: This is not legal advice. If you are considering
    using the \"Heineken\" free font in a commercial project, see a lawyer.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Thanks Don and R. I don't want to use the font, but wanted to know about it
    because I couldn't work out what it was - I could find nothing similar.
