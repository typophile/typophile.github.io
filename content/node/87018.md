  body: Could be [[http://tracertong.co.uk/ttf/2011/06/coalition_v2/|Coalition]] (it
    says on the website that the lower case has solid characters as opposed to the
    distressed uppercase).

  body: That's so close, thank you! The "A" is different though. I might be able to
    make this work, unless anyone knows anything similar to the above.

  body: I think its not a regular font. It's a graphically designed font in coral
    draw or adobe. I often create these type of fonts for [[http://www.printingblue.com/|printing
    stickers]].
