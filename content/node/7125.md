  body: '&#62; Alpha Beta <BR> <BR>Hey, looks nice. And perfect timing: I was planning
    a trip to UCLA tomorrow, and they have it. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something I recommend,
    although it&#39;s more about the evolution of the alphabet in terms of typestyles:
    &#34;The Shaping of our Alphabet&#34; by Frank Denman, 1955. <BR>Towards the end
    it contains some words that are personally encouraging to me: <BR>&#34;However
    far the next revolution is to carry us, it is fairly certain that the initiative
    of one man will spark it. Perhaps he will be a genius who will come up with an
    idea so original and so obviously right that the craft will be compelled to accept
    it. Perhaps it will be a man with the vision and power to say: &#39;This thing
    must be done,&#39; and enlist and organize the brainpower to do it.&#34; <BR>Although
    since I&#39;m not a genius and I can barely organize my own life, he must mean
    somebody else. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: The interesting thing about &#34;Alpha Beta&#34; is that it is a history of
    the development of the alphabet and not of the design of letters. It starts at
    pre-alphabetic civilization and ends with Roman inscriptional lettering
