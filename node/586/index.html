  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">we are involved in the rebranding of romania&#39;s seventh IT company and we have analysed so far rebranding programmes for IT companies. almost all of them go for the logotype solution. <BR> <BR>so, we tried to develop a logotype based on the visual personality of the old logo, in an attempt to preserve some brand equity. I wanted to ask all the great type designers on this forums where they get theit inspiration from. <BR> <BR>how do you start working on a logotype? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12809.gif" alt="comparison"> <BR> <BR>is the solution we came up with acceptable from the type pont of view? thank you all so much .... <BR> <BR>PS: there is another thing bothering me now: brand&#39;s verbal distinctiveness lies in its &#34;X&#34;, but this letter evolved into a visual cliche. what&#39;s left to be done?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t like to be rude, but maybe you should really think again about the concept of that double line in x letter. It is not just that it is a visual cliche, that cliche is also a bit dated and could even cause difficulties with legal protection in many countries.  <BR> <BR>&#62; how do you start working on a logotype?  <BR> <BR>Mostly the same way you did. What you did could be one of the schetches, but maybe you have to look for more solutions and than choose the one with no obvious problems like &#39;visual cliche&#39;. <BR> <BR>In case you insist to present this logo, you will probably have to make vertical/horizontal optical correction. You should also consider the rythm of the logo which is broken &#40;as Dmitry noticed&#41; by the very wide and open D. It&#39;s counter is much larger than the ones in other letters.  <BR> <BR>I hope that we will be able to follow the evolution of this logo soon. <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

Radix is involved in several field of IT. more can be found on <a href="http://www.radix.ro" target="_blank">www.radix.ro</a>, their corporate website. <BR> <BR>as I have already mentioned, they decided to rebrand due to several factors, among which the high similarity of their symbol to that of one competitor, and the anniversary of 10 years of activity. the celebration will be held on July the 19th and all the work has to be done by that moment. they decided for a logotype that incorporates some design element that would preserve a part of the visual equity of the brand, that&#39;s why the whole process is rather hard to develop. <BR> <BR>I will be providing refinements made to the logotype as I develop them. <BR> <BR>thank you for your imputs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>mm = millimeters versus points.</i> <BR>It is preference in units. The advantage I see in using points is a direct relationship between the layout measurment and the type measurement can be more precisely calculated. However, since so much of design is not about calculating, but seeing, I&#39;d say who cares. Trust your eyes.  <BR> <BR>The card looks nice. <BR>Good work George.</div>
