  body: I&#39;m going with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/delphin/">Delphin</a>,
    though I have to say it doesn&#39;t look to me like the <i>B</i> in &#34;BLEU&#34;
    belongs to Delphin.

  body: Thank you Dave. I think you are right. But I am a little disappointed. I had
    high hopes that the rest of this alphabet would be really really good looking.
    Delphin is just alright.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of any other similar italics
    that have a &#42;d&#42; like this one? I found Cochin but it was not too much
    of an improvement. I am looking for first class stuff. <BR> <BR>Is it out there?

  body: :-0 Just alright? Are you sure? It is so beautiful. -- There is always <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/poetica/" target="_blank"> the old
    standby</a> Poetica or you could try something new -- <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/ancienne.html"
    target="_blank"> Ancienne</a> or <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/bibl.html"
    target="_blank"> Biblon</a> both by Stormtype -- By the way, they have so many
    beautiful versions of different things, it is worth a browse if you haven&#39;t
    already. <BR>

  body: I always think of it as &#34;that <i>Room with a View</i> typeface. So much
    so that the times I&#39;ve tried to use it I just can&#39;t think of anything
    but that movie. <BR> <BR>One of the things I love about doing these type ID challenges
    is that invariably, as I&#39;m searching for the face in question, I come across
    dozens of other amazing faces and foundries that I&#39;ve never heard of before
    and probably wouldn&#39;t stumble upon any other way.
