    Bold</a> is similar, but it&#39;s hard to tell exactly how similar from the limited
    showing online.

  body: It doesn&#39;t happen very often yves, though I did just get a new dual 1.8
    G5 here at work so that will probably trim .1 seconds off my ID times. The biggest
    obstacle between forum users and sub one minute IDs remains the stubborn typophile
    backend. <BR> <BR>And BTW, a one minute ID doesn&#39;t make anyone look bad with
    the possible exception of myself. I mean, what kind of loser sits at his computer
    attempting to ID type samples in under 60 seconds on a message board. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
