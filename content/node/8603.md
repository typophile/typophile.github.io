body: Hello All, <BR> <BR>Since yesterday&#39;s announcement of the Mac Mini, I&#39;ve
  been considering picking up one of these for the home. My only concern is upgradability
  &#40;you can&#39;t upgrade the memory or hard disc yourself&#41; and with power.
  How will the 1.4GHz G4 hold up to Design apps like the Creative Suite provided I
  get one with at least 512MB of RAM. My only experience with CS is on a G5 and on
  PCs. Any suggestions appreciated.

  body: I assume that you would want better video performance than you would get in
    the mini. It is easy to add an external drive via firewire. <BR> <BR>If you deal
    with large files, a desktop mac would be a better choice. It also seems that the
    ram upgrade is expensive enough to put you in the desktop range by the time you
    make that addition. <BR> <BR>Shop the refurbs from the Apple site for nice deals.

  body: I&#39;ve run PS and the CS pkgs on a Cube &#40;G4, 500Mhz.&#41;; a full install
    of apple software, Panther, full CS, 1000 fonts is only about 13 Gig storage.
    The key for me is RAM. On a G4, Panther and these apps work fine with at least
    1Gig of memory, but will struggle at 512Meg. A separate Firewire backup drive
    is nice, also.  <BR> <BR>I feel the miniMac is more for web, email, wp, and PS
    Elements, not so much for serious work. <BR> <BR>JMHO. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR> <BR>John

  body: Well, either buy the mini for $500 and upgrade in 2 years for another $500,
    or by a $1800 tower now, and then uprgade it over the next 4 years piecemeal.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, I bet within a week or so you&#39;ll start seeing instructions on how
    to add RAM yourself to it. <BR> <BR>Now, if you&#39;re doing super-high-res Photoshop
    work, well, then maybe you want to go with a tower and maxed out RAM...but that&#39;ll
    cost you much more than than the Mini. <BR> <BR>What would be cool is if you could
    connect multiple MINIs together to increase processing and RAM...sort of a mini-supercomputer.
    ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Finally, I&#39;m running a bunch of design software on an old
    Powerbook 665mhz machine. The minis are what? 3 times faster than that?

  body: The mini is almost as powerful as my TiBook, which runs most apps &#40;such
    as CS&#41; just fine. The mini is very attractive for a lot of reasons. It just
    doesn&#39;t seem <i>robust</i>, which is something people like us seem to need/like.
    Not expansion-friendly, etc. <BR> <BR>That being said, having to move two full-size
    towers makes me year for a computer that I could cradle in one hand, along with
    my limited desk space...perhaps I&#39;ll just get Apple&#39;s stamp-sized G7 in
    2010.

    <BR> <BR>Well, you can <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2003Aug/bma20030903021581.htm">make
    a Beowulf cluster with G5s</a>, so you could probably do it with Minis.'

    mini doesn&#39;t have enough power for you.  <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t it cute though?!
    &#40;You could download all your music onto it, as well as video and/or photos
    and attach it to your telelvision and have an all night entertainment area!&#41;

  body: Well, this isn&#39;t going to be my primary PC, it&#39;s going to be for mac
    stuff that I want to bring home once in a while, which while most design file
    formats are cross platform, I still run into a bit of trouble especially with
    converting mac postscript fonts on the PC &#40;which is a nightmare due to the
    resource forks&#41;. I&#39;m thinking of ordering the $599 one and boosting the
    ram up to 512MB. With the upgrades and tax, it&#39;s not exactly a budget PC anymore
    but with OS X and its cute form factor, a mac at home would be welcome indeed.

  body: Apparently though, you can&#39;t upgrade the memory yourself though this is
    still a bit unclear at this stage. As Darrel mentioned earlier, though, I expect
    to see some way around any possible restriction. It also only has one DIMM slot.
    If it&#39;s clear that you can do it yourself with breaking the little case and
    voiding the warranty, I will undoubtedly go third party, but if not, I may consider
    Apple&#39;s inflated prices. Third party prices for a 1GB single DIMM of DDR333
    RAM is around $180, Apples price is $425&#40;!!&#41;. The uprade to 512MB isn&#39;t
    that bad. &#40;70 &#40;3rd party&#41; vs. 75 &#40;Apple&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Love the

  body: Great discussion. I&#39;ve been wonering what other creatives thought if the
    mini. Considering I&#39;m currently on a G3 Blue Tower this would be considerably
    faster than what I have now and at a fraction of the price of a G5 Tower. My biggest
    complaint is that you can&#39;t upgrade it yourself. Now if only I could install
    an external video card <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: James...I think memory has to &#39;officially&#39; be put in via an Apple
    certified person. I have a hunch, though, that you could buy the mini, buy some
    RAM on your own, then walk into the Apple store and have them do it for you.

    to be very capable. But you&#39;re going to want at least 1GB  <BR>of RAM. Also,
    Apple is picky about what RAM they will say is  <BR>compatible so I&#39;d just
    have Apple install it. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, if you&#39;re used to a G5
    I could see how going  <BR>home to a slower machine would disappoint.

    void the warranty, see <a href="http://macintouch.com/mwsf2005notebook.html">here</a>.
    Now, adding in bluetooth and airport does bump the price up a lot &#40;$129&#41;,
    something not many people are talking about. Also, it seems that upgrading the
    internal drive isn&#39;t possible, but external drives are fairly cheap. I would
    say that if this is a backup or work-at-home machine, it would be fine. If it
    was a daily use machine, i&#39;d be hesitant. It sounds like you just want a work-at-home
    machine, so I would go for it and install more ram yourself. I second Joe&#39;s
    suggestion of  1 gig of ram: that seems to be the point where OSX is happiest.'

  body: A 1.4 Ghz G4 processor with 512 will certainly do professional graphics.  I
    have several G4 1Ghz at work that are running Adobe Creative Suite, Adobe Indesign
    CS and Quark Xpress 6 doing heavy duty pdf workflow with PDF-X-Robot.  Now, they
    are not as fast as the new G5 boxes that I have but they are very solid machines.  PDF-X-Robot
    will run automated all day long on them every day of the week.  I agree with another
    poster that it won&#39;t be good for video editing but for page layout and production
    it will do the job for sure.

    who already have a PC at home and want to replace it with a Mac. Until now, switching
    to a home Mac meant getting an iMac or an eMac, where you&#39;re essentially having
    to buy a keyboard, mouse and screen instead of just upgrading the CPU.  <BR> <BR>This
    is a smart move since it gets Apple on the sub-$1000 home market. But it&#39;s
    aimed at people who already have a monitor and other peripherals and just want
    to get a swanky new OS. <BR> <BR>Not saying you won&#39;t be able to use this
    as a capable, home workstation... it&#39;s just that it wasn&#39;t designed for
    that. <BR> <BR>&#40;My brother works at Apple, so I&#39;ll pretend to be an expert
