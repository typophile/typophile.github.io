body: Just thought I&#39;d warn you all to bring bug repellent with you or buy it
  when you get here.  I walked to the bus stop this morning &#40;a route that takes
  me right past the convention center&#41; and got bit at least four times by mosquitoes.  They&#39;re
  not usually too bad in downtown, but I just wanted to warn all of you.  :-&#41;
