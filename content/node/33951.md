    like the constantly changing (and often too wide) letterspacing. You should get
    rid of the justified setting.\r\nAnd your I-dots are too narrow over the I."

  body: "thanks a lot for the quick response.\r\n\r\n@tim, I uploaded another version
    which I totally backed away from justified setting and also corrected the dots.
    Please let me know if you see something you don't like.\r\n\r\n@john, well I see
    your concerns about my skills, does this mean you are not going to hire me? \r\n\r\nI'd
    appreciate opinions regarding the layout.\r\nagain, thanks a lot!"

  body: "I mean, nobody is expert in everything, and as it's set now, I don't see
    what's your best card, even after a good read.\r\nWho want's to spend half an
    hour knowing who you are and what you can do ?\r\nI think you should put the focus
    on your \"violon d'Ingres\"\r\n\r\nbtw, I feel resume_loose.pdf is not a solution.
    it's kinda messy.\r\n\r\nAll this needs clarity.\r\nStong message.\r\n\r\n+"

    body: "Here are a few things I noticed:\r\n\r\nIn the Work Experience, Education,
      and Exhibitions sections, you should put the items in chronological order with
      the most recent at the top rather than at the bottom.\r\n\r\nChange hyphens
      to en dashes and lose the space on either side\r\n\r\nYou use a combination
      of proportional old style numbers and tabular lining numbers....I would make
      them all one or the other, preferably all old style.\r\n\r\nI think the all
      caps bold is a little much...more emphasis should be placed on the job positions
      held rather than the company worked for, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWhy is your email
      and telephone italicized? Seems like it should be formatted the same as your
      address.\r\n\r\nIn the section, Exhibitions and Awards, the line with TSOA Scholarship,
      there is a double space before New York University.\r\n\r\nLastly, I disagree
      with John about your skill section...it doesn't seem unrealistic to me.\r\n\r\nGood
      luck with your job search!"

  body: "In addition \u2013 \u2018clients such as\u2019 is not as impressive as \u2018clients
    including\u2019 (unless you haven\u2019t worked for them and are using those examples
    to cover for clients that you have worked for \u2013\_in which case that is taking
    client confidentiality a bit too far). \r\nI would turn over Efes and if Shop
    and Miles is a client I would change the order or change the \u2018and\u2019 to
    an ampersand so that the order isn\u2019t so strange at the end of that line.
    \r\nThe Reading exhibition is a bit obvious with the large tab, I would overhang
    the \u201C to slightly reduce that space, the space after doesn\u2019t follow
    the others and if you tab the dates I would also tab the skills section. I cannot
    see why Exhibitions & Awards would be in two lines.\r\nThe period spent as a freelance
    flash developer should be treated in the same way as the other positions.\r\nOverall
    I feel too much space is taken up on the left.\r\n\r\nTim"
