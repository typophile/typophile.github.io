  and I'm having trouble finding the right font.  I am looking for something that
  is sort of classically french, but I am open to anything you guys might think appropriate.
  \ I just know that I don't have anything that I think will work.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I agree with Carl that one shouldn't be too literal. On the other hand, I'm
    sure he agrees with me that typefaces do have associations, and it <cite>is</cite>
    a French movie (and the character isn't French by \"accident\") so it's a bonus
    if the font has something French about it. All this means that the French angle
    should be just another factor, and not anything central. But since there are so
    many fonts out there, it is a nice way to narrow things down.\r\n\r\nConsidering
    the movie seems to be a dark but human tale, I think Peignot is too playful (although
    the youth angle might make it click) and Didot/Bodoni is too cold. Just mentioning
    two things from the top of my head: Beorcana (one of its superb dark weights)
    or ITC Mendoza.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Mouchette was released in 1967 at the peak of the French New Wave. For that
    period, your best text face is Vendome, used for heads in all the hot paperbacks
    the French read at the time. If you want an earlier French look, FF Acanthus or
    Andrade from MyFonts are very authentic. If you want late 19th century, ITC Bodoni
    Twelve serves very well. Peignot, however, is too specific, Parisian, and touristy,
    so avoid that choice. And Antique Olive is appropriate to nothing here--ugh! The
    original poster shows a crude block display face, which can be found at any of
    the free font sites, but you still need a proper text face, and for that, think
    of what would go with the world of cinema-going at that time--Vendome.

    with no misogynist intent. Tiffany, it''s a feminist issue, not about femininity.
    The use of "guys" is no different than the usage of "he" as a generic personal
    pronoun (as in, "when the typographer buys a new typeface, he should read the
    EULA") or the use of the suffix "-man" in words like chairman. It''s a mark of
    the creeping masculinization of social space. '
