body: "This might be basic typography knowledge, but unbeknown to a beginner like
  me. \r\n\r\nI have seen some signage + fonts where certain characters like the \"o\"
  or the \"c\" have an underscore, they appear to be set in lowercase even when the
  rest of the characters are uppercase. I'm not sure what the exact terminology for
  these characters are, hence I'm at a loss on how to do even a basic Google search.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is a screenshot of [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_typeface_six/&s=c?&sample_text=cogq&sample_size=144|FF
  Typeface Six]] that contains these characters."

    Six (instead of Typeface 169,506) or a TV channel \"Channel 5\".\r\n\r\nSCNR Andreas"

  body: "In some cases they\u2019re ordinals comparable to the English 1st and second,
    you might also see abbreviations such as No. or St. handled this way. The bar
    is added to keep it from creating a giant white hole under the letters. It looks
    cool, so some type designers have made an affectation out of it."
