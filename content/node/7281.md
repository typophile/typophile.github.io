  body: Jason, you need the words travel gear incorporated in the logo, or it could
    be a brand of beer, hotel or other business. Did you try a round four directions
    arrow reflecting their globe?

  body: hey daniel, my teacher told me i could drop the travel gear, as this is a
    packaging class and she felt that if you were already at a gear shop, you would
    know the brand. I was indifferent and thought it wouldnt hurt to keep it in there.
    I will play around with it. <BR> <BR>As far as rounding the arrows, it would probably
    defeat the whole coming and going aspect which is incorporated with a compass
    &#40;you will notice in the negative space the arrows are all pointing in to one
    spot, while the positive arrows are all pointing out in all directions. I will
    try it right now to see if they still read. <BR> <BR>thanks!
