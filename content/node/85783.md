  took the image from the  thread : http://typophile.com/node/60103 \r\nThe extract
  comes from the Emile Javal\u2019s book titled  \xAB Physiologie de la lecture et
  de l'\xE9criture \xBB.\r\nSomebody identified the font from 14 pt (that the font
  which interests me). It would be probably a creation of  De Berny foundry c. 1900.\r\n\r\nIt's
  one of the most employed fonte for edition of cartularies (latins texts and documents)
  in France between 1890 and 1920.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that it was indexed in :
  \ \xAB Le Livret typographique. Specimen de caract\xE8res \xBB (De Berny & Cie,
  1912). \r\nIf somebody has this book could say to me which is the name of this typeface
  ?\r\nThank you, have a nice day\r\n"
