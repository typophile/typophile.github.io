  logo of mine!  This is for Love Garden records, an indie record label I've been
  asked to art direct for.  Hope you like it and please tell me if something looks
  off.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2261447200_1253ffe418_5486.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2261429998_4d30be61d7_3811.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2261429900_fd896d97a6_4404.jpg]\r\n"

    or so because it will probably look dated by then.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    down and saw the vector version, I didn't get the same reaction. Maybe because
    of the order I saw it in. Maybe you bring some of that watercolor texture into
    the logo, but in a simpler way. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, bravo. "

    Love the watercolor. Very nice.

  body: "The G in Garden is problematic. As some of the letters are caps and some
    are lower case I thingk the G should be a cap. It's hard to read.\r\n\r\n\"The

  body: "Thanks for the feedback!  I think I can answer Sharon and logosam simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason I'm not going to use either suggestions (though they are both really good
    ones), is because I like the fact that the seemingly abstract symbol for the love
    garden is in truth the o,v,g, and a of the name.  Typically we'd expect \"LG\"
    to be the wordmark, but instead it uses other letters in the name to create a
    symbol that to me feels both \"mod\" and arcane/alchemical/psychedelic--which
    is the \"big idea.\"\r\n\r\nhere's the tilt:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tilt_4239.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
    the symbol by itself:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/symbol_4856.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
    here's an example of it in use:  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tshirt_6218.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    just REALLY dig that.\r\n______________________________\r\nAwesome>> www.biklopsdesign.com"

  body: "I'm OK with this. I don't have the same worries about it being dated. It's
    strong, but simple at the same time. \r\n\r\nAlso, I love the watercolor as well.
    Hand made? The 'g' alone might be an issue but in the context of the word as a
    whole, it seems to read just fine.\r\n\r\nAs a poster, I think the elements work
    great together. As a logo, I think the wordmark stands best on it's own without
    the duplicated enlarged circle and triangle elements."

    made by printing the design up on my inkjet and then spraying it with a water
    bottle as it came out!  Nice, right.  I'll use that trick again...  And thanks
    for the kind words, I love it as well.  Unfortunately, the project is sort of
    heading into a ditch that is out of my control.  But hey, you do what you can!\r\n____________________________\r\nAwesome>>

    these 8 letters based on dozens of typefaces I've been seeing allot of myself!
    \ The blown-out deco-inspired thing is definitely big right now...but it was in
    the 60s as well which is where I stole most of my inspiration--sixties fantasy
    novels.  \r\n\r\nI created this logotype, but if you want a full features typeface
    I'd just poke around veer.  They have 4 or 5 like this including the new <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000298&WT.ac=type.080301.1.img.strand\">DF
