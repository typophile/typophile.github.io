body: "It\u2019s a book\r\n\r\nHave I written a book? You ask me. What\u2019s it about
  then? About fonts! I see your puzzled look. Let me explain. Fonts are made up of
  small drawings that, when put in succession, make up words. You know, like on your
  cell phone when you send messages to your mother. If you place the tiny drawings
  in the right order she may find them useful or even funny. \xB6 Let\u2019s take
  it one step further. Suppose you put all your messages one after the other. I see
  question marks in your eyes \u2013 but stay with me. If your messages are interesting
  enough, you may want to keep them. Your old cell phone is now at the bottom of your
  desk drawer and your computer is waiting for its final journey to the nearest recycling
  plant. \xB6 Imagine; hours of sending messages that end up in a recycling plant
  as tiny particles without meaning. What a waste, not only of your precious time
  but also of the beautiful sets of drawings which you had so carefully arranged.
  The feeling of dissatisfaction won\u2019t leave you and it doesn\u2019t help that
  your mother continues to recite loose fragments of your thoughts from her memory.
  What do you think? Am I not connecting with your daily routine here? \xB6 All right
  then. Now if you would put all these messages in order, arrange them according to
  contents and subject and perhaps compile them into meaningful paragraphs with words
  and sentences, wouldn\u2019t that be a great idea for a book. You could then print
  a few copies for yourself and for your mother. Imagine how thrilled she would be,
  quietly riding along on your train of thought. Fascinating don\u2019t you think?
  \xB6 Of course this is only an imaginary picture, but my fantasy continues. Your
  mother passes on, and because you live in a digital world by now, your have no need
  for all the things she collected during her life. You have all her belongings picked
  up by your local trader and the cash in hand is exchanged for the latest mobile
  gadget. \xB6 Your mother\u2019s books end up at a book trader who picks up your
  book with these fascinating little messages. You see him wondering? Shall I keep
  it or bin it? It all comes down to this tiny moment in time. Will your writings
  be worth saving. Are they of value to anybody, other than your greatest admirer?
  While you\u2019re busy sampling your latest gizmo, the decision about possibly the
  only tangible thing you could be remembered by \u2013 the only non-virtual proof
  of your existence, is taken elsewhere.\r\n\r\nVerba volant, scripta manent\r\n\r\nJoep
