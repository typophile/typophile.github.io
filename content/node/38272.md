  body: "I've been totally unaware of the new fonts in Windows Vista since I'm still
    using XP, and I have to say I'm really surprised I haven't read anything about
    them until now.\r\n\r\nAnd now I look at those fonts, they're really pretty good.
    I'm seriously considering changing the default fonts in my browser from Georgia/Tahoma
    to Cambria/Candara now."

    install the Powerpoint Viewer on my Mac and use the Vista fonts legally without
    having to run Windows.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m guessing that the license prohibits that,
    tho."

  body: "I'm sure if you look hard enough you'll be able to find some loophole to
    avoid paying for the fonts, but is it really worth the effort? \r\n\r\nI think
    people point to the PPT viewer, rather than the Office 2007 Compatibility pack
    which also includes the fonts, so they can claim getting one over on MS. Fact
    is that these fonts are available to Windows customers in various forms, and anyone
    who needs them on Linux, Mac, or their Symbian smartphone can license them like
    any other font.    \r\n"

  body: "After trying out Cambria/Candara as my standard web fonts for two days, I've
    switched back to Georgia/Tahoma. The major problem with Cambria/Candara is that
    they've got terrible kerning in the hinted version -- it's so bad that some letter
    spacing are indistinguishable with real spaces. Plus, both appear too thick --
    almost bold -- in the hinted version. I don't know how they look in ClearType,
    but at least on old fashioned CRT monitors those fonts are definitely unusable
    as web fonts. Actually, I'd even go so far as to say they look like fonts designed
    by amateurs:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cambria_4462.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/candara_4364.png]\r\n\r\nWhat's
    also quite obvious is that the x-height of Candara is very small (significantly
    so in comparison to Tahoma, for instance) -- also a property unsuitable for web
    viewing, this one regardless of ClearType or not.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question
    is, are those fonts actually intended to be \"web fonts\"? If so, how can those
    obvious mistakes go undetected, and if not, why are people saying they are?"
