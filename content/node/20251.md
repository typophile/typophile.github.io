  tram system in Manchester more than 10 years ago) was ever (or is still) available
  for purchase?

    name, but you can trademark it.

    Metro by Dwiggins.\r\n\r\nDwiggins' type was titled Metromedium, along with Metrolite
    and Metroblack. Linotype seems to have trademarked all these naming instances,
    so it doesn't appear that there is a trademark  infringement here.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    Tom Hingston's type for the Metrolink, I don't know it but you could always email
    them to ask but I guess it'd be a property face. I  didn't find anything on google."
