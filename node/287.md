  body: Hi Josh, <BR>my first impression was very good. what i lked very much is the
    way the wheights extend, when they become fatter.  <BR> <BR>The round serifs and
    the drop-endings will probably be to heavy for running text. Maybe you should
    make the stems a little more thicker, so that the overall contrast &#40;=difference
    between the thin and fat strokes&#41; will be higher. <BR> <BR>Mathematically
    the widths of your roundings &#40;bowls&#41;, should be more then the widths of
    your vertical stems, so that optically they wont look thinner. <BR> <BR>v, w,
    y, and the x need serifs or something else to fit in with the rest. You can leave
    the inner stem of the &#39;m&#39; without serif, but i wouldn&#39;t shorten it
    the way you did. <BR> <BR>For the &#39;z&#39; i could think of a tail inspired
    on the tail of the &#39;k&#39;. Thus dropping under the baseline. <BR> <BR>Maybe
    you should also try a version with shorter upper strokes. <BR> <BR>I am curious
    about the capitals. <BR> <BR>--Jacques
