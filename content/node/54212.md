body: "I'm putting my thoughts together for the logo for a software product called
  \"Pingstrom\". The name is play off the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom|\xC5ngstr\xF6m]]
  word, which is metric unit equal to 1/10 of a nanometer. \r\n\r\nThe software deals
  with (computer) network measurement, which primarily revolves around a technique
  called 'pinging' - repeatedly sending small pieces of data to the target computer
  and then expecting the target to return this data back. Think submarine sonar pings
  for a more conventional analogy.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'd like to get a general idea
  if either of the following concepts is worth pursuing. Serifed type is used to try
  and capture the precision aspect of the software, which is implied by the angstrom
  reference.\r\n\r\n(A) This on is a straight forward reference to \xC5ngstr\xF6m.
  It also maps nicely to a small application icon, which is obviously pretty important.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pingstrom_5611.png]
  \r\n\r\n(B) This one tries to capture the nature of the actual pinging process.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pingstrom-2_4985.png]\r\n\r\n.\r\nThoughts
  or comments ? Thanks."

    ? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ping_4787.png]\r\n\r\nReason I'm
    asking is that some people read \u03C0 as 'pie' and some - as 'pee', so I'm curious
    what the ratio is. I'm playing with the idea of pairing Pi and the ring and not
    sure if it's going to be too obscure."

    FWIW, in German \"\u03C0\" is pronounced \"pee\", most English speakers I've heard

    too.\r\nI think your other two ideas so far are more \"universally legible\" (and

    that may not be that important and may get removed completely later in the process.\r\n\r\nYou
    can try positioning those dots a bit higher so they don't look like parts of letters.
    You can use a combination of dots and circles... like OK pings and failed ones...
    All I'm saying is play with dots if you want to have them. Just don't play with
    letters and dots and change meaning and diminish dot meaning...\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "Thanks for the comments, much appreciated.\r\n\r\n@christian: I made a quick
    attempt building the dot/ring into the P and it looked quite a bit quirky. I'll
    give it another try and see how \xF6's dots look when treated the same way. Thanks
    for the idea. \r\n\r\nAlso, there is a Unicode symbol for \xC5, it's 0197 (C5
    in hex). Pretty much any decent font has it.\r\n \r\n@litera: The reasoning behind
    the dot business is like this - the O needs dots and the A needs a ring to re-enforce
    the \xC5ngstr\xF6m reference. That's a starting point. Having both the ring and
    the dots looks strange, so the natural tweak is to use a dot for P (since P-ringed
    is a made-up symbol anyhow). Also, the dot over P creates a mild visual annoyance,
    since the dot would've been more appropriate over the I, and this may make the
    logo more memorable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the logo needs to have a smaller, \"built-in\"
    mark that can work on its own as an application icon. P alone won't work for a
    number of reasons, but P+dot/ring could do it. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTo move away
    from the dots and rings, how does this one look to you, guys ? Just ignore the
    rendering/kerning issues for now. \r\n\r\nThe concept is that of a [[http://www.chinalabsupplies.com/G84.JPG|micrometer
    caliper]] used to measure one item in a stream of network packets. Pending any
    collisions with existing logos, I think the concept is pretty solid. Thoughts,
    comments ?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pingstrom-5_5895.png]"

  body: 'epsilicon, Have you considered simply creating a nice type design and pairing
    it with a mark? It looks as though you are forcing ideas into the lettering which
    can give the company a kind of scattered and frenetic feel as opposed to a solid
    and decided stance. I like the type you are working with (except the S looks fuzzy
    and slants strangely). What about placing the 3 dots together in the form of a
    triangle on the side with nice color and typography and a well considered strap
    line. '

  body: "@speter: In principle I agree that P-ring has more potential. However this
    is the software logo, and so it comes with some unique restrictions, both visual
    and geometric. Latter are especially nasty. The mark needs to fill a square shape
    more or less evenly and it needs to scale down to 16 x 16 px size (which is one
    of the reasons why the <em>ring</em> is not really an option, but, for example,
    the dot is).\r\n\r\nShari, thanks for the insight. I have shelved the idea of
    a wordmark and instead I am now looking at the exact option you described. Using
    the \"Micrometer P\" from my previous post as the mark.\r\n\r\nIncidentally the
    three dot mark I cannot do, because I used it with one of my previous projects
    and consequently sold the whole thing, artwork and copyrights included.\r\n\r\nAlex"
