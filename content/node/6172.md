body: I am building a limited glyph truetype font. This font has only 10 or 15 glyphs
  that represent map symbols. The rest of the glyphs are empty. Working in FontLab,
  what is the recommended approach to these non-existent glyphs? Leave them untouched?
  Fill them with a zero width character? Place some sort of nondef symbol in each
  codepoint? This font will be functioning only in a WIndows environment. Any advice
  would be appreciated.
