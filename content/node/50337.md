    see some traditional work before it becomes digitalized. '

  body: "Nice drawings!\r\nIf you do get stuck on certain characters, try using a
    paint brush to draw. This will allow a natural flow of the strokes. The rounded
    terminals are a dead-give-away to this style of type.\r\nI also noticed that your
    numbers, or figures, are looking very blocky. The numbers in your reference photo
    fit better with the typeface. Try drawing the numbers with a similar stroke contrast
    to the lower case letters so that all the characters will harmonize with the design.\r\n\r\nKeep
    up the good work!\r\nTerrance"
