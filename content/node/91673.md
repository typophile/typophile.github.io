  the right fonts for it is a priority.\r\nSo far, I've decided that body text will
  be in an oldstyle face like Garamond Premier Pro or Arno Pro, shall see which one
  is rendered better by browsers. \r\nAnd I need to pair it up with a sans serif font
  for headings. Given there's a limited choice of Cyrillic web fonts (I think I'll
  use Typekit), I decided to use Baker Signet. What do you guys think about such a
  combo?\r\n\r\nThe text is Cyrillic on purpose, since overall impression is very
  different from Latin\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/garamondandbaker_6432.jpg]"

    just because it's where I started looking for a pair.
