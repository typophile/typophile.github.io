    things there. Also some odd things.\r\n\r\nThe big problem is that it's really
    only designed for use with Apple Advanced Typography; the OpenType tables are
    missing a lot. Even on the AAT side, the italic ligatures aren't tagged at all,
    so I don't know if programs just look for the 'f_i' glyph anyways and use it if
    they find it, or what...\r\n\r\nThe OpenType tables that are there are more often
    than not 'lfbd' and 'rtbd' (left and right bounds), which is great if you've got
    a program that can choose a character based on whether or not it's at the beginning
    or end of a line, but not so useful otherwise.\r\n\r\nI use TeX mostly (which

    Black]], but that is close enough! Farao Book works surprisingly well for text,
    I used recently & was very pleased with the results. I gave it a short review
    as well for our national design magazine (this is the unproofed version)\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nFARAO\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nTo
    classify Farao merely as a \u2018slab-serif\u2019 is akin to describing Twin Peaks
    as a mere \u2018drama\u2019: the closer you look at it the weirder it gets. It
    is true that Farao has slab-serifs, but looking at the individual details reveals
    the eccentricities of certain letterforms, strange constructions that challenge
    one\u2019s notion of how a letterform should be \u2018correctly\u2019 formed.\r\n\r\nIf
    the \u2018g\u2019, for instance, was a person then it would\u2019ve been locked
    away at birth. The \u2018c\u2019 contradicts the vertical stress of the \u2018o\u2019
    and differs entirely the pointed stroke finish of the \u2018e\u2019. The slabs
    of the \u2018s\u2019 bully the rest of it\u2019s curves into submission, giving
    the appearance of a contorted snake about to strike. Farao\u2019s uppercase isn\u2019t
    quite as deranged as the lowercase\u2014the inherited straightjacket of majuscule
    limits overly affected construction. The numerals, however, flaunt the familial
    oddness beautifully\u2014slab-serifs and ball terminals are held together with
    excellent curves. \r\n\r\nUp close, Farao is certainly odd, but the individual
    inconsistencies make it perversely consistent as a whole. It is a warm, full-bodied
    family with a palatable coal-fired heft. Designed by Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm,
    it is available in a confusing array of styles. This is fortunately allayed by
    the very reasonable price and OpenType compatibility. \r\n\r\nFarao can be purchased

  body: "Parry grotesque normal or semi-bold\r\n\r\nfrom Ourtype:\r\n\r\n<cite>Parry
    is a typeface design of Artur Schmal. It began as Schmal's graduation project
    at Type & Media in The Hague. Inspired by the sturdy typefaces of Edmund Fry and
    Thorowhood, it came out as a rather traditional, heavy slab serif, complemented
    by an even heavier condensed variant and a series of sanserif capitals.\r\n\r\nAs
    of 2004 the typeface saw further development: First, designing the slab serif
    that would be suitable for composing longer texts yet retaining the Victorian
    atmosphere. Secondly, drawing a matching Grotesque, as part of the same family.
    \r\n\r\nDespite its nineteenth-century perfume, Parry is a contemporary type family.
    It produces a rounder and softer image than the often rigid slab serifs of those
    times. Some of Parry's design features - like the top serifs - have an outward
    bulge. And, although such details might be regarded as 'not done', Schmal opted
    for them, because 'it simply looks good' in combination with sharp-edged bottom
    of the lowercase c, e and d.\r\n\r\nParry Grotesque family comes in four weights:
    Normal, Bold, Semi-bold and Black and comprises matching Italics, Small Caps,
    as well as text figures.\r\n\r\nAvailable in Open Type Standard, TrueType and
    PostScript for Mac and PC. OpenType Pro is scheduled for release in Spring 2007.</cite>"

    Greek uc letter Sigma (\u2211), used in math as a summation operator. \r\n\r\nTo
    be precise, it is Bickham Script <strong>Pro Bold</strong>. While the Standard
    version shows a rather generic non-script \u2211, the Pro features this fancy
    one\u2014which, imho, looks like a L hit by a flowerpot (or a \xA3 that can\u2019t
    afford a proper crossbar).\r\nIt\u2019s nice to see the makers cared about those
    poor cousins of the charset table. Still, I wonder who wants to have a summation
    operator on a wedding invitation\u2026 Then, mathematicians can be quite peculiar.\r\n\r\nFor
    the record: It was New Yorker Richard Lipton who \u2018has further explored the
    design possibilities of this 18th century English round hand writing\u2019 <a
    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/bickham.html\">[\xB9]</a>. The
