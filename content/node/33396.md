body: "I was pondering the influence of contemporary faces on the perceptions of \"proper\"
  letter forms. Specifically, the trend to include \"some serifs\" to distinguish
  things like the l, 1, I and i in sans faces. Nick mentions the trend <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33301\">in
  this other thread</a>. Another example might be the little right angle hook on some
  Js.\r\n\r\nAre there serifed faces that have begun to draw from this trend? Examples,
  thoughts?"

  body: I suppose another related inquiry is, are there effective examples of these
    "load-bearing" semi-serifs being used in high resolution media where a more classical
    sans would have had equal clarity and similar connotation?

    very texty -- lots of spreads with just a few sentences of really huge body copy
    -- set entirely in TheMix.\r\n\r\nAlso, annual reports of that era set in FF Letter
    Gothic Text, which is the proportionally-spaced version of what is primarily a
    monospace design."

    I am assuming the \"edge\" of design is still on paper."

    that quickly came to mind, probably because one tends to remember something from
    when it first registers as a phenomenon. I doubt whether such things would strike
    me as being so noteworthy now."

    \u2014 the diversification of uc i en lowercase l in sans serifs has a long tradition:
    Johnston's London Underground comes to mind\u2026\r\n"

  body: Koch Antiqua is an example of a serif face with a few "missing" serifs, and
    other early 20th century faces, eg Parsons, have semi-serifs.

  body: "Unlike i or l, the serif in G seems much more accepted in a sans serif font.
    \ Similarly, the tail of the t is also very common.  Does anyone know about the
    history of why these adoptions to a pure sans serif font have become more accepted?\r\n"

    seems to be a gap between the kind of designers who create and/or appreciate great
    edgy digital design and designers who focus on print. In my case I ignore it because
    I just do not have the time to sift through bas Web 2.0 sites and Flashturbation
    to find the good stuff.\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel that the serifs on some characters
    are just important parts of the character of the letter, particularly <em>I</em>.
    While they may have originally appeared to clean up rough stroke ends or simply
    as ornament, I feel like they have become an integral part of some letters over
    time and that we are often better off when some of those critical serifs, tails,
    and loops are left in."

  body: I would say that letters themselves are artificial, so the negative connotation
    you imply is needless. I would have to say, from my limited experience, that the
    skeleton approach is just one of many methods, and has some validity.
