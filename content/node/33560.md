  make a legibility pre-test for a brochure (i don't know if this is the term) for
  teenagers. The subject of the brochure is Children's Rights.\r\n\r\nSo, I have to
  make a test, and I don't know how to start it.\r\n\r\nI thought that i could start
  with serif and sans serif block texts, but... I'dont know how to make the questions.\r\n\r\nDo
  you know were I can find legibility test?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n"

    of size, leading, and tracking settings, then I create one for every font I want
    to use. After that I narrow it down to a few possibilities and check those at
    optimal line lengths and in whatever colors they\u2019ll be printed."

    type do you have to work with? Are you thinking of licensing a font?\r\n\r\n"

    my own judgement, but I can't because this test is for my master thesis.\r\n\r\nI
    choose for sans serif type: Helvetica, Din and Univers\r\nFor serif type: Times
    New Roman, Sabon and Adobe Garamond"

    getting in the way.\r\n\r\nBut putting that aside: What did you do? How did you
    decide?"
