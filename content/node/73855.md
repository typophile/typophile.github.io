  body: "I do not think the condensed type is harmonizing with the shape of the planet.
    Next to the perfect circle of the planet, the type feels squooshed.\r\n\r\nDo
    you have any more info on who/what this is for? Feedback is much easier to give
    if we know what you're trying to accomplish."

  body: "It is for a band called Sounds of Saturn. The name comes from the now famous
    audio recordings of Saturn's rings. \r\nOne of my thoughts was to cut a hole in
    the middle of the planet, so that it would look more like a record or CD, however
    that really kills any feeling of dimension created by the rings.\r\nThey wanted
    to keep the mark fairly simply and straightforward. Nothing specific was set about
    the type, so I am open to all kinds of suggestions.\r\nType is definitely my weakest
    skill, so I love to hear suggestions!"

  body: "As for type, depending on the style of the band, you could try either a still
    more techno/sci-fi look, or trying to match the O either with the circle of the
    planet or the ellipse of the rings.\r\nAlso, in order to lighten the relative
    blackness of the planet, you could try to incorporate a S into the circle shape."

  body: "If you keep the planet solid a round heavy geometric type might work very
    well. Depends on what kinda band it is as well. If it's a rock band you might
    want a type that's more aggressive then this. \r\n\r\nIf the symbol is gonna be
    this simple I would make it a lot smaller, there's is no need for it to be this
    big when there is nothing more in it. I would make it slightly smaller then the
    type and have some nice details in the type instead.\r\n\r\nI would try making
    soundwaves out of the rings but this might night work so well. What riccard0  suggests
    with the S in the planet might work, this would diminish the blackness of the
    whole thing."

  body: "much better.\r\n\r\nI would even use something more geometric than this.
    Where the other letters like 'S', 'U' and 'N' follow the 'O'.\r\n\r\nThere is
    also a possability to create some combination between the mark and the word \"OF\".
    You could have the rings on the right side transfer into the 'F' somehow. Might
    make the whole thing more interesting.\r\n\r\nRight now it does look better than
    before but I still feel that it's a bit boring.\r\n\r\njust my two cents\r\n\r\npeter"
