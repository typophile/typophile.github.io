    CANNOT use them for free.

  body: true, mostly these are meant for people making their own comics, so that&#39;s
    why i say contact Nate Piekos before using one of these fonts for your projet.
    <BR> <BR>Read EULA <a href="http://www.blambot.com/license.html" target="_blank">
    here</a>.  I guess you should be fine if you are a non-profit, if not you might
    hafta use &#42;gasp&#42; Comic Sans ha ha!

  body: I knew a designer once who always showed his clients a diagram with the three
    words &#34;good, fast, cheap&#34; on it. When negotiating contracts, he would
    tell them that they could pick two &#40;i.e., they could have their project done
    good and fast, but then it couldn&#39;t be cheap&#41;. <BR> <BR>I remembered this
    when I saw your post&#39;s title, Alberto, saying that you want a font that is
    &#34; free, fun, [and] slightly futuristic.&#34;

  body: Do you know which one? I&#39;ve never been quite sure how to choose type for
    kids, and I&#39;d be interested if you can shed some light on this. My gut feeling
    is that people tend to &#34;talk down&#34; to kids and choose dopey faces that
    seem to them, as adults, to have qualities they read as &#34;childlike&#34; and
    &#34;fun.&#34; The educators at our museum, at least, seem always to favor &#34;lively&#34;
    faces that move perilously toward the comic sans end of the spectrum. Whereas
    the best designing for kids I&#39;ve seen is in trade book publishing, where the
    faces seem in general much more sophisticated. I suppose one gets paranoid about
    coming off as boring. What do you think?

    font if you were to buy one, instead of look for a free one.
