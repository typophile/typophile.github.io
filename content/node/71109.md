  prhase \"The American School of Quer\xE9taro\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo
  45_5666.gif]\r\n\r\nThe type on the prhase seems to be futura but the terminals
  on the \"e\" \"c\" \"S\" are horizontal. \xBFCould this be a mix of Avant Garde
  and Futura?\r\n\r\nAlso I have tried to identify the letters for \"JFK\" but the
  only sans serif typeface I can find with the hook \"J\" is Vibration Gothic.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "There could be a number of funny things going on here. The initials in the
    bottom line may be Futura, but the lower case could be Avant Garde Gothic (AGG).\r\n\r\nThe
    J may have had its outline tweaked to raise and level off the upstroke of the
    'jaw' (could have been done easily with AGG's J).\r\n\r\nNotice that the legs
    of the K are not even in JFK -- possibly more outline tweaking?\r\n\r\nWhy some
    of these customizations were done is not easy to explain, but it would be my guess
    that Futura and AGG were both used and customized in this piece.\r\n\r\n- Mike
