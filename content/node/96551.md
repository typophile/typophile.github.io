body: Hey everyone, so I'm looking for a similar font to this picture.  The font in
  this picture isn't a font, it's a custom made logo.  I'm just looking for fonts
  that have the same vibe or would fit nicely if I wanted to add a U at the end so
  it'd say APKU.  It would also be greatly appreciated if you could list some suggestions
  on what fonts you think would look nicely with it if I were to put some text around
  it, lets say I wanted to incorporate the words "affiliate program" in the design.  Let
  me know what you think!  Any input is greatly appreciated :)
