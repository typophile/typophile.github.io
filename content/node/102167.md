    Aside of replacing the space between \u201CStudio\u201D and \u201Cfh\u201D, what
    is the role of the accent colour otherwise?\r\n* How does this fit into a wholesome

  body: "The 'Mondrian reference' is actually a side effect - at the centre is a play
    with the letters F and H which are hidden in the white space. The resulting squares
    and rectangles are arranged in Golden Ratio proportions.\r\n\r\nColour-wise, the
    firm operates in Uganda, and a 'rusty Orange' is one of the defining colours in
    nature here due to the red soil. I like its warmth and strength, especially on
    the charcoal background.\r\n\r\nThe font is Canadatype's reinterpretation of Semplicit\xE1
    by Alessandro Butti. Its 'humanist geometry' sits well with an Architectural understanding
    that is firmly rooted in, but not enslaved by, the modernist Architecture of the
    early 20th century. \r\n\r\nThere is a second, maybe slightly less Mondrianesque
    option that also may have better proportions between icon and text:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-studiofh-02_5902.png]"

    in 4-color process printing, so consult a printed swatch book when choosing the
    screen tints for color printing, don't go by what it looks like on your monitor.
    Any good print shop would have a process swatch book if you don't. "

  body: "> Don't know much about Pantone\r\n\r\nIt's a system that applies numbers
    to different colors, making it easy to specify a precise color to a print shop.
    \r\nwww.pantone.com\r\n\r\n> In Illustrator, my screen tells me that 1788 C is
    the closest \r\n> (although not sure though whether 'Solid Coated' is the right
    \r\n> colour book to use?).\r\n\r\nIllustrator is telling you that that if you
    want to print it using orange ink on coated (glossy) paper stock, ask the printer
    to use Pantone 1788 ink.  \r\n\r\nIf you're printing on uncoated paper, it will
    look a little different since uncoated stock will absorb some of the ink, so you
    may need to use a different Pantone number.\r\n\r\nBut if you're printing using
    4-color process (like in a brochure with color pictures), the printer won't use
    orange ink, they'll use 4 printing plates \u2014 cyan, magenta, yellow and black
    \u2014 to create all the colors. While this process is economical, some colors
    may reproduce better than others, and orange can be tricky sometimes in 4-color
    process. An alternative is to add a 5th printing plate that only prints orange
    ink, and that way the color will be exactly right. Corporations often do that
    so their corporate color will always print correctly. Unfortunately it costs more.\r\n\r\nFor
    any kind of printed piece, it's better to pick your ink colors by looking at actual,
    physical swatch books. "

  body: "FWIW, Pantone 1788 is a warm red (coated or uncoated). If you want to keep
    the 'rust' vibe going and brighten it up a little, try adding a little yellow
    and take a look at 1655 C or U. \r\n\r\nJamesM, over here it's swatch central
    and I don't restrict my swatch collection to paper ... :) I've got a wood, marble,
    glass, acrylics and I'm now picking up metal stuff too. I've some fabrics mostly
    industrial too. Swatches are inspirational. The Pantone books are far better than
    going over to places like colorlovers or kuler for sure!\r\n\r\nn. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the hiddenness of the initials is fine. The logo plausibly says architecture
    to me so it doesn't live or die based on the letter recognition. \r\nLeveling
    the crossbars makes way to much of a window IMO. \r\nI don't get the vertical
    alignment in the original post: it looks like the tops of the boxes line up with
    the top of the /t/, but then makes those taller descenders /d/f/h/ look like they
    poke up too high. \r\nTo my eye, \"ARCHITECTS\" looks like it starts left of where
    \"studio\" starts: you may have to fudge the mathematical alignment to get persuasive
    optical alignment. \r\nI quite like the colors and font.\r\nIt certainly says
    European modernist though--both the Mondrian look and the Bauhaus-like lowercase
    and geometric simplicity--so be aware that that architectural style is implied."

    down the company name so that the taller ascenders now line up with the upper
    edge of the boxes; at the same time I have increased the size of the 'sub-heading'.\r\n\r\nJamesM,
    for now I have settled for Pantone 173, although the real decision will come when
    I get going with the printing. I have not found a suitable 'Charcoal' tone in
    the Pantone library, but again, I'll rather use the swatch book when I get hold
    of it.\r\n\r\nThis is how it now looks:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-studiofh-2_4709.png]"

    logo in a tiny size and \"Architects\" will become too small to read. If you want
    to keep Architects the current size, you might consider having an alternate version
    with it bigger just for times when the logo is tiny (although you run the risk
    of the client accidentally using the wrong version)."
