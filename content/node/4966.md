body: As you may know, I&#39;ve been working on the ATypI Type Technology Forum topics
  for ATypI Prague at the end of September. There are two days of programming, one
  of &#34;beginner&#34; material and one &#34;advanced.&#34; <BR> <BR>I have a full
  slate of &#34;advanced&#34; stuff pretty much complete with speakers lined up. But
  what I am lacking is speakers for the beginner track. Because of the foundational
  nature of the beginner track, I have quite a few ideas about some appropriate topics
  &#40;although I&#39;m still open to suggestions&#41;. However, I still need volunteers
  to talk about these items. If you have some expertise in the area, will be at ATypI
  Prague, and would be willing to do all or even part of a presentation, please let
  me know by May 31. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really hoping not to do more than one or two
  of these myself.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
