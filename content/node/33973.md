  Fire House font (or any kind of free firetruck font). I am making a sign for a coworker
  for a fundraising event for her volunteer work in San Carlos, Costa Rica. I don't
  have a budget for this. Otherwise, I'd buy Fire House. Thanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/firehouse.shtml\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/firehousecharacters_3542.gif]"

  body: "$30 bucks isn't a bank breaker, but I'm not one to preach. \r\n\r\nSo, I'll
    recommend checking out dafont, look under their Western style types. You're probably
    not going to find anything that looks like Firehouse, or at the same level of
    quality, but then again, you get what you pay for. "

    body: Thank you for the help. Yes, I understand that $30 is not a bank breaker.
      There are projects where purchasing a new font is not necessary and this is
      a good example of that kind of project. Thanks again.

    been said) called Western.  There are lots of shareware, free (0$) and commercial
    fonts in this genre. Adobe Wood Types are probably even cheaper than $30, it's
    the cost of a pair of socks.  My system seems to have several, probably that came
    with some software; it can be hard to keep track, sometimes.\r\n\r\nA couple of
