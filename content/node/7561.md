body: Wondering if anyone can ID this face. It looks similar to Gridnik, or Din, but
  I don&#39;t think either of those are it. Thanks for your help! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/53025.jpg"

  body: Yes it reeeeeally looks like Alpha Headline but the A is a bit off. But it
    might just be the resolution of the attached image that messes it up. Everything
    else looks right.

  body: Ignacio, you are correct. This sample&#39;s taken off of my site, and it is
    indeed Alpha Headline. Cheers, Sam

  body: Isn&#39;t it traditional to point out that <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?4W1">Carplates</a>
    looks very similar to Alpha Headline, or do we assume everyone knows that by now?

  body: Thanks everyone. I guess Alpha Headline was &#34;bought out&#34;. Too bad.
    Bad for us, good for Lineto I&#39;m sure... Thanks Sam for the confirmation -
    and by the way, you do fantastic work!

  body: Thanks! <BR> <BR>&#40;And for what it&#39;s worth, I think I actually did
    try out DIN and Gridnik for that page. So many fonts, so little time!&#41;
