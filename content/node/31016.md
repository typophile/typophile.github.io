    (e.g. Latin, which is what we use for English, and very little to do with the
    Latin language), or fonts that look like writing/ hand-drawn lettering."

  body: Most of these fonts are also part of iWork. But, still cool. I'd imagine they
    paid a grundle to be able to just offer them willy-nilly from their site.

  body: 'Hey! I downloaded that a long time ago from a link at Wikipedia. The link
    I believe was on the Apple fonts page. Most are boring, but I like the Braganza
    and Portago faces. And of course, the Bodoni 72 small caps. The full bundles of
    iWork and Apple Works have the full range of the Bodoni 72s, but who am I to complain? '

  body: "Tiff: I finally figured why I did not have these fonts... I have the first
    version of iWork. the new version- '06- has more stuff. \r\n\r\nBut this little
    collection isn't all that bad.\r\nWhen I get my pizza place up and running I'll
    use Jenson Old Style or maybe if I'm feelin' really 'classy' I use Algerian.\r\n\r\nThe
    monospaced avant guard and souvenir is scandalous!\r\n\r\nOk for reals though...
    as mentioned Bodoni 72 Small Caps by sumner stone is great, Type Embellishments
    1 is something we all should have in our libraries, Portago is very good, Academy
    is a fine classic, Braganza is nifty, and Mona Lisa now has old style figures-
    (it deserves some respect for having osf numerals right?\r\n\r\nNext on my list
    is extract the font in my ipod- oh wait- I don't have one.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    Tiger without using the original system install discs, I might  be able to finally
    get rid of all of the annoy/tacky system fonts that just won't die...

    thread</a> over on Apple.com -- specifically you can manage the fonts. I use combination
    color-coding and Fontbook. My main font management tool is Font Explorer, but
    I don't activate or de-activate fonts system fonts with it. I'll quit Font Explorer,
    open Fontbook disable the system fonts I need disabled, re-open FontBook and voil\xE1,
    Font Explorer see it. \r\n\r\n(Fontbook)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fbprev0131_3963.gif]\r\n\r\n(Font

  body: "Good to see these are getting distributed. I wrote the Wikipedia page that
    Dan Gayle refers to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fonts_in_Mac_OS_X which
    also mentions hidden fonts such as Apple Garamond and the ones at /Applications/iDVD.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts/\r\n\r\nMy
    main aim in doing this is to get as large a variety of fonts installed on end
    user's systems so that they can be used on websites. Braganza Small Caps looks
    wonderful for headings in the right setting, we just need it to be installed on
    a significant enough percentage of systems."

  body: "nickshanks... very excellent Wiki entry! I have to stop thinking free fonts
    because- we bought these products and we should get all the we can out of them.
    There is not point to hidden fonts. Take apple casual: no one and their grandma
    knows that apple has made a nice alternative to comic sans but there it is.\r\n\r\nSo
    thank you and keep up the good work,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\n\r\nPS... I tried

  body: "I popped in my Mac OSX install cd and ran a program called Pacifist on it,
    and I was surprised by the results. Almost all of these typefaces are on it! Notable
    exceptions being the Braganza and Portago faces. I think there are even some extras
    not mentioned before. Some of them are hidden in the various installers on there,
    and of course there are the X11 fonts on there as well.\r\n\r\nPacifist is donationware,
    so if you're interested, just pop your install disk in. Then after about 5 minutes
    and a few disk exchanges, you can search through every single file that you can
    install. Even hidden ones!\r\nI typed in a few searches such as .ttf, .dfont,
    and MM and it worked pretty well. "
