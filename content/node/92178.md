    <a href=\"http://tdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-30-at-6.36.13-PM.png\">This
    is</a> what the keyboard layout of Sholes & Glidden Type Writer (a.k.a. Remington
    No. 1, before 1878) looked like: 43 letters, all caps, no figures 0 and 1, no
    parentheses and brackets, no exclamation point. In the 1960s I remember using
    Cyrillic \u0423 for Latin V, and figure 1 for Roman numeral I: in Russian typography
    Roman numerals are used in denoting centuries, thusly: \u0425\u0423111\u2013\u04251\u0425
    \u0432\u0432. But all typewriters in Moscow had Russian keyboard layout! Before
    decimal (soft-dotted) i (\u0406), yat (\u0462), fita (\u0472) and izhitsa (\u0474)
    had been dropped in 1918 Russian typists used fita for the V and Cyrillic decimal
    i for the I: \u0425\u0474\u0406\u0406\u0406\u2013\u0425\u0406\u0425 \u0432\u0432.
    That substitution was standard practice in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=fYZBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U3uxXO7LsVS16hqbxlY4XuVyrBh-w&w=685\">typography</a>
    too.\r\n"

    first I couldn't figure out why Frutiger would type a capital Oh where he meant
    to have a zero, but then I realized that on Swiss typewritters the need to accomodate
    extra characters probably meant the Oh and zero shared a key! Which BTW is exactly
    what happened on Armenian typewriters as well: the capitals \u0541, \u0545 and
    \u0555 did double-duty as the 2, 3 and zero (since we have 38 letters)... which
    BTW is where my Windows/OSX Armenian keyboard layout got that idea.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Most mechanical typewriters for English etc. had neither a zero nor a one
    key. Those with lining numerals used an ell, as you see there, and there were
    also ranging numeral designs that used a capital I. Some even required assembling
    an exclamation point from a period and a relatively massive straight apostrophe.

  body: "@cerulean:\r\n<cite>Some even required assembling an exclamation point from
    a period and a relatively massive straight apostrophe.</cite>\r\n\r\nMany mechanical
    typewriters did not have a 1 key, and required one to use the lowercase L instead.
    Nearly all of those also required one to compose ! from ' and . because ! is normally
    the shift of 1 in the manual typewriter layout as well as the electric typewriter
    layout.\r\n\r\nHowever, very few mechanical typewriters did not have a zero. That
    is for two reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first is:\r\n( and ) are the shifts of 9 and 0
    respectively, and thus omitting the zero would have meant an unconventional location
    for a vital character. As well, the * - key (or the _ - on an electric) is to
    the right of the zero key. It's the + = key that got omitted on smaller typewriters.\r\n\r\nThe
    second is:\r\nWhile the lowercase l is, like the numerals on a typewriter, an
    unshifted character, the capital letter O is a shifted character. Thus, omitting
    the zero would make numbers much more inconvenient to type, while omitting the
    one only changes typing a number slightly - one has to find the 1 in a different
    location, but no extra motions of shifting are required.\r\n\r\nSo, at least for
    the typewriters I have experienced in my part of the world, ! is much more often
    omitted than 0."
