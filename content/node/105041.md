body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm tasked with designing what should be the first serious
  edition of a seminal work of modernist poetry; the original ms. is unusual in that
  the author, amid moments of otherwise normative free verse, would insert moments
  of concrete poetry, and the transitions were typographically seamless because of
  his use of a monospaced typewriter for both.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that to set this
  new edition in a monospaced face would be to foreground the concrete moments of
  his book, while uglyfying the \"literary\" moments (which are not concrete, and
  which predominate).\r\n\r\nSo I've tentatively designed the book to be a mix: nonmonospaced
  lines of poetry, with the concrete moments tabbed and rigid. This \"solution,\"
  however, departs form the author's original typescripts; furthermore, the transitions
  between normative type and monospaced type feel *very slightly* jarring, from a
  typographico-visual perspective. I'm using Twentieth Century Medium, rather than
  a serifed roman, for the entire interior, to try and allude to the casually vanguard
  feel of the writing.  \r\n\r\nThe option of using two different typefaces (a monospaced
  as well as non-) is pretty much off the table.\r\n\r\nIf any ideas, or condemnations,
  occur to anyone out there, please share them."

    with InDesign \u201COptical\u201D kerning for the rest. (You would have to reduce
    the size of the space character.) This approach would work quite well with one
    of the more attractive monospaced fonts, e.g. MVB Fantabular.\r\n\r\nFF Letter
    Gothic, a proportionally spaced typeface, combined with monospaced Letter Gothic.\r\nOther
    faces that have both proportional and monospaced variants: Alix (mentioned above)
    and Century Schoolbook, etc.\r\n\r\nPanoptica (monospaced unicase) for the concrete
    part, and Parity (proportional unicase) for the other. Caveat: This face was designed
    for concrete poetry, so may seem strange for the other, although perhaps \u201Cvanguard\u201D.\r\n\r\nUse
    a face throughout that looks monospaced, even though it is not, such as Of\uFB01cina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, everyone. This is serious food for thought. Nick: I'm investigating
    those typefaces as we speak. Joshua, here is one (simple) instance of the transition
    from verse to \"concrete\" poetry. In this sample I'm letterspacing the block
    to left/right align, rather than setting up tabs. This images should answer your
    question, though.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/182_6629.jpg]"

    lines. It's tough for me to imagine using it for a 300-odd pp. book by a poet
    less severely experimental than B\xF6k, though."

  body: "Jeff, I don\u2019t think letterspacing a proportional font, as shown, is
    appropriate, because although it conforms to the layout, it disguises/camou\uFB02ages
    the author\u2019s intention\u2014and arti\uFB01ce\u2014in writing each line to
    contain the same number of characters.\r\n\r\nBTW if you make images a maximum
    of 588 pixels, they will display in Typophile without scrolling.\r\n"

    that the point seems to be for each column of characters to line up vertically,
    I would use the same (not monospaced) font as the main text, and set it as a table,
    with each character centered in a cell and no visible cell strokes. Or use center-aligned
    tabs for each column, etc etc. Still don't see why a monospaced font is a requirement.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    A recent example of this that I did:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capsingrid_6572.png]\r\n\r\nAldus
    is not a monospaced font. Of course, there's a lot of letterspacing here because
    of the all-caps setting, but you could use much less space in your case."

  body: "Joshua: here is a quick mockup of that page, with me replicating the author's
    typescript w/ Prestige. And then another showing, this time with the closing block
    of the poem tabbed. The book is primarily 300ish pp. of non-concrete poetry, so
    we're leaning towards prioritizing it, rather than subtly disabling the entire
    work by deploying a monospaced face, if this makes sense (my reasoning is that
    a book of this nature, set in a monospaced typeface, is going to code as \"off\"
    or unusual  to many of its intended readers\u2014though I'm fascinated by Nick's
    suggestion to optically kern the non-concrete passages, so that the monospace
    typeface won't inhibit extended reading). Still thinking/designing my way through
    this, however. Thanks to each of you, JC\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/182d_6356.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/182c_6641.jpg]"

  body: "I rather like your second example. Unfortunately, you really do need that
    much letterspacing (just tried it) to maintain the look of a grid and prevent
    uneven spacing from being distracting.\r\n\r\nIf you were using a face with a
    smaller <em>range</em> of character widths \u2014 a serifed face, or a less geometric
    sans \u2014 you could get away with closing up the spacing a little more before
    it became too awkward.\r\n\r\nIf there are really only a few passages of this
    kind in the book, I would say by all means use the same face as the main text
    and set it in this way \u2014 though I find that tables are easier to work with
    than tabs, because you can select all the columns at once and change their widths
    together.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to look for would be type families that include
    a complementary monospaced font \u2014 like, for instance, The Sans and The Sans
    Mono (Thesis family).\r\n\r\nAnd is that italics in the original? As underscoring,
    maybe? If so, obviously you'll need a font with an italic."
