  body: "The work is a three-part series originally published from 1851 to 1853. Without
    knowing which edition this is from, hard to ID the metal typeface.\r\n\r\nScotch
    Modern was popular at the time of the book\u2019s first publication, but your
    sample lacks the thick/thin contrast common to the face:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\r\n\r\nAmong
    contemporary digital typefaces, a condensed version of Century or Clarion might
    do:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-century/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-725/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/clarion-mt/\r\n\r\nMadison
    Antiqua is another option:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/madison-antiqua/"

  body: "I can find nothing digital that is a proper match for this low contrast narrow
    serif.\r\nAs a poor substitute with no historical links to your typeface, but
    which  might pass muster by the casual reader because it has a similar low contrast
    and ratio of height to width, you might consider Stirling RR \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StirlingRRLightAsStones_6711.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/stirling-rr/\r\nDon"
