  use the programs.\r\n\r\nCut the rambling short, what is the base line grid, and
  what do I use it for? \r\n\r\nIve scoured the internet which brings up a bunch of
  crap. \r\n\r\nIm sure most of you typophiles out there know how to utilize it. I
  would love any insightful information. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Rather than the position of the baseline being determined in relation to
    a text box, baseline grid determines it in relation to the page, and, when it's
    on, overides any leading value applied within text boxes.\r\n\r\nIt's a good way
    to get the type in adjacent columns to line up with one another.\r\n\r\nIf you
    set 9/10, but the grid is 14, you get 9/14. If you set 9/14.5, you get 9/28.\r\n\r\nA
    good trick is to set the grid to half your leading. That way you can do stuff
    like applying extra between-paragraph leading with a value equal to the baseline
    grid."

  body: "(James, it's quite debatable whether you are actually being taught to set
    type if you're not being taught to use the baseline grid functions for either
    Indesign or QuarkXpress). \r\n\r\nHere are a couple of screenshots from some classes
    I've done. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Indy-grid_5635.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QXD-grid_6323.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    second example (from a magazine I worked on in the early 1990s) demonstrates both
    the second and the last points that Nick makes above \u2013 the standfirst paragraph
    at the top has a leading value that takes the text baselines to every <em>other</em>
    line of the baseline grid. The adjacent column baselines at the bottom of the
    picture align perfectly at top and bottom of the column height.\r\n\r\nI also
    often suggest that commonly-recurring negative spaces within a publication (e.g.
    picture box runarounds, column gutter values and inter-paragraph spacing) are
    best worked out as multiples of the baseline grid/main text leading value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere
    is also a rather scant mention of the baseline grid in a downloadable .pdf tutorial
    from Computer Arts at\r\nhttp://www.computerarts.co.uk/tutorials/2d__and__photoshop/editorial_type_design"
