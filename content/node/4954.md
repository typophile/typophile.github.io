body: I have a sense that I&#39;m probably missing something really obvious, but is
  there a quick/simple way to make block shadows for type in Illustrator &#40;v10&#41;?
  Or a plugin that will do it? <BR> <BR>At the moment I&#39;m creating a blend between
  two offset type objects, expanding the blend, ungrouping and then merging all but
  the top layer of the blend. But this method creates a lot of unnecessary points
  and is just generally kind of awkward and time consuming. <BR> <BR>This is one of
  those things which I presumed would be really simple but when it came to it, having
  never actually tried it before, turns out to be a pain ... <BR> <BR>R <BR> <BR>

  body: You have actually picked one of the two ways that Leslie Cabarga suggested
    in his book! I do it this way too. I always zoom in and delete the extra points.
    His book has quite a few useful tips and tricks &#40;more like mini-tutorials&#41;
    you should check it out or better yet <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581804369/typophile-20/002-8623298-6974419"
    target="_blank">buy</a> it.

  body: Better yet ... local typophile god - Mark Simonson - just showed us all a
    beautiful trick. Although if you expand the appearance it still gives you all
    of those points.

  body: Yeah, that&#39;s nice. But I still think there must be a better way. From
    misc googling it seems that some signwriting software will do it ... I&#39;ll
    report back when I know more. <BR> <BR>R
