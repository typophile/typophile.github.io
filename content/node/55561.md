    be running font management app that does everything your viewer does?"

  body: "James, you make a good point. Certainly the users of this forum would likely
    have such a tool installed. Which is why I hope to solicit some feedback from
    such power users. \r\n\r\nThough from my informal survey of colleagues, there
    are plenty of designers who have not licensed a font management application and
    might appreciate a free alternative. I think that a web-based version has the
    potential to offer some community resources and statistics that are uncommon in
    standalone applications. Thanks for the comment, James. \r\n\r\nAny other feedback?"

  body: "Just tried it. Works stunningly fast. The purpose could be for people who
    work on different machines to gather the views of their fonts, to choose from.
    (If the samples are saved. Are they? Couldn\u2019t verify it by now). \r\n\r\nFor
    some reasons my Museo-fonts aren\u2019t displayed correctly. They appear as TNR
    \u2026?!?\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Museo_4028.png]\r\nAlso if you
    have created a lot of tags the fontinfo panel below goes down and can\u2019t be
    seen again.\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to have an option to select more than one
    font to tag. So it is a bit troublesome to select each weight and tag it. "

  body: "Renko, Thanks for the feedback. \r\n\r\nThe application will store your fonts
    and settings from separate computers into your catalog, but will only display
    those fonts which are installed on your current system. As of this writing it
    will not render fonts that are not installed, in short because that would require
    an enormous library of font files on the server.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the tag
    window sizing issue and a fix should be online within a few days. \r\n\r\nGreat
    idea on selecting more than one font. I'll look into the Museo rendering.  \r\n\r\n"
