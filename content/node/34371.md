  body: "This is a really interesting topic. At this point there are so many choices
    with such subtle differences within the classification of san serifs, that the
    one you choose to use is going to reflect some sort of intention. \r\n\r\nBut
    even information that is desired to be neutral, is never desired to be boring,
    or at least\r\nun-noticed. So when a designer wants something to be \"neutral\"
    what are they really trying\r\nto say?\r\n\r\nOr perhaps the idea of neutrality
    changes. You have to change in order to remain neutral."
