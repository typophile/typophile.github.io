body: "Can anyone ID this font? It has humanistic tendencies with Geometric serifs.
  There is a lot of modulation in the stems. It's similar to Bodoni or Didot, but
  not quite. The \"R\" is a good distinguishing letter.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/victorian_6175.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/victorian_2_3445.png]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: If this really is nineteenth-century, it has been done by hand, probably based
    on something like Engravers Roman. The distinctive R may simply be a flight of
    fancy by the letterer...

  body: 'Thanks, Engraver''s Roman is the closest thing I''ve found. Yes, it was done
    by hand is my guess. It''s from an old type compendium. I was just looking for
    something close. '
