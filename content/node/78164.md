  body: Looks similar, but the bowl on the lower-case "e" is shorter in Mostra Nuova
    and there is no serif on the lower-case "d"

  body: "<cite>Looks similar, but the bowl on the lower-case \"e\" is shorter in Mostra
    Nuova and there is no serif on the lower-case \"d\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    what I meant by saying \u2018somewhat based on (or rather inspired by)\u2019\r\n\r\nMaybe
    a poor attempt of copycatting Mostra.\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents:\r\nIf the client can\u2019t
    provide you with the original font (and as penn already implied this wouldn\u2019t
    be that bad\u2026), suggest to use Mostra Nuova (or another professional font
    in this style). Some wouldn\u2019t notice and those who do would get it as an
    improvement."
