  body: "I think for me the problem is that the letters look distorted, starting with
    the shape of the serifs, and the length of the stems. The relatively monotone
    character of the letters is odd enough. It made me think of the old Adobe MM font
    Penumbra, which I think allowed the user to adjust the serif size from Sans to
    full Serif. My feeling is that this was done by converting to outlines and just
    yanking points all over the place. (i.e. Custom).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
