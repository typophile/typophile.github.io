  body: "Further to Tiffany's point:\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s there was a photo-type
    version of Centaur that did not suffer from this thin-ness, so characteristic
    of many photo and digital versions of metal types. Centaur suffered more than
    most.\r\n\r\nThis version was made by proofing the entire Monotype hot-metal character
    set on newsprint, rather than on the hard, impermeable repro paper commonly used.
    The ink seeped into the paper, gathering weight. These proofs were then used as
    the basis for that version of Centaur. I do not know what company made this. It
    may have been a proprietary version for a particular typesetting shop.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: It is all due to ignoring what I call "ink squish" - the fact that metal type
    allowed the ink to spread into the paper - creating a warmer and heavier looking
    font. I actually think that some fonts look better output to lower resolution
    imagesetters because they are closer to the letterpress (ink on metal type) version.

  body: "<cite>wasn't the only type . . .</cite> Hell, they are almost all bad this
    way. Not only the overall thinness, but the contrast between the thick & thin
    strokes. With letterpress, the fine lines of the metal bit into the paper a little
    more, lessening the contrast.\r\n\r\nPart of it was rushing. Janson went from
    the most popular (2nd most popular?) Linotype font in the linecaster days to \"not
    used\" in the Linotron 202. The lower-case \"oh\" looked like two small parentheses.
    Janson Text was a partial fix. It took me three solid weeks to get a Janson I
    liked. \r\n\r\nIf your license allows, you can fix most of them. Centaur would
    be one of the tougher ones, as getting the contrast right is quite important.
    We had designers keep using it in spite of my objections. Finally my business
    partner said we had to do something, so I just emboldened it in Fontographer --
    about 3-4 units, as I remember. Not a cure, just a band-aid. I got stubborn &
    decided not to spend the hours needed to re-work the contrast, esp. since in metal
    varied a fair bit. Perpetua is similar. The 14-point master was about the smallest
    that would work. Now you get people wanting to use it at text sizes. To do that
    correctly would involve reinventing the font, as it just wasn't originally meant
    to be used that way. A lot of work & probably no one would be pleased.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a lot to recommend in many of the older metal faces. Just remember that Linotype
    & Monotype, by in large, never made good versions of the metal fonts for photocomp,
    early digital, or PostScript. By the 70s & 80s, they were being sold & sold again
    to companies looking only at the profit line.\r\n\r\nIf you have the patience,
    you can rework them for your own use, and they will rival or exceed most of the
    new stuff.\r\n\r\nJust a old 20th century guy's opinion."

  body: "Tosche\r\n\r\nTo respond to your question I would suggest that Centaur is
    likely as it is supposed to be (though it was likely patterned after photofilm
    renditions rather than metal). The difference between the digital and the metal
    would be that you are looking at, in the latter, are specimens of the face as
    printed with a process that has inherent weight added to it (via ink spread and
    the optical additive of impression). Easily 5% at minimum.\r\n\r\nThe original
    designs are themselves rather thin in the Monotype metal version. And, it was
    a very poorly structured face in that regard as it does not hold up well under
    repeated printing (letterpress). The digital version, printed via the photopolymer
    plate process has much more strength but this is due to the differing relief structure.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of a digital typeface per se, well you can't always get what you want, especially
    when differing type production technologies are involved.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    it in the above. I have found in my revival of Caslon that the contrast issue
    is one of the most important to getting the warmth of older metal type, and it
    requires creative effort to get a good result. (I discussed this in my talk at
    TypeCon 2006.) As Charles says, 14 point is not in fact a text size. I believe
    that using 14 point metal masters is one reason why so many initial digital versions
    of classics were anemic when used in text (9-12 pt). \r\n\r\nI know from his posts
    here at Typophile the Raph Levien also has had the ambition of producing a text
    Centaur, but I don't know how far he has gotten with it. He says [[http://levien.com/type/myfonts/|here]],

  body: "Tosche\r\n\r\nFirst of all, don't look only at drawings. Look at printed
    work, and \"real\" books are often more helpful than specimen sheets.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    what shows on the screen with your example is just an artifact of getting them
    on the screen, but if you look at a printed letter (printed letterpress), there
    will be a blacker ring around the outside of the letter, and the center of each
    stroke will be a touch lighter.\r\n\r\nYou probably know how Monotype made their
    matrices, so at one level, replicating the drawings may simply replicate the problem.
    The drawings used as templates also had to allow for \"ink squish,\" what we want
    is the letterform after it was printed.\r\n\r\nAn expensive book, but worth it
    to some one in your situation, is Fred Smeijers <cite>Counterpunch</cite> from
    the Hyphen Press. You are in effect making a digital punch, and the thinking is
    the same as for someone making a metal punch.\r\n\r\nIn passing, 14-point is on
    the upper edge of text size. Monotype sizes were a little smaller than Linotype,
    but in the earlier photocomp days, Linotype would use a 12-point master for \"text\"
    fonts, this being a compromise between most test sizes (8-10) and, lets, say,
    subhead/chapter head sizes (12-20+ points).\r\n\r\nBut is is the <cite>design</cite>
    of the letterform that is most important, not its nominal size -- of course, ther
    is usually a strong correlation here."

    good job.\r\n\r\nIt's easy with hindsight to see how we went from A to B, but
    what if we had gone to X instead?\r\nThere were many aspects of the high resolution,
    digital workflow that we had to come to terms with.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s
    there was a vogue for ITC Garamond Light Condensed in graphics (and other) publications
    such as catalogues. It was set small and tight, very tidy. Now, that would have
    been problematic with the previous generation of phototype technology, because
    the fine details of that typeface tended to vanish as it was reproduced photographically
    several times during the production process. So here was a new look--and the high
    res digital workflow also made using Helvetica 25 and 35 practical at smaller
    sizes. Who was to say that \"squishy\" letterpress gain would be required in the
    digital age? Wouldn't that be like faking the sound of original instruments in
    a Baroque recording? Bauer Bodoni was another typeface that was popular for text
    in the early days of digital; it certainly looked a bit anemic to me, but a lot
    of people were attracted to its extremely fine details. The novelty appealed,
    perhaps, and the thrall of high-tech slickness.\r\n\r\nAnd unless a typeface was
    produced with size-specific variations, a version that corresponded to a \"middle
    size\" was appropriate for use in deck and display settings, as well as printed
    on a 300 dpi laser printer.\r\n\r\nThere were foundries producing size-specific
    fonts from the early days of digital type--those that catered to magazines and
    newspapers, such as Font Bureau and Hoefler of course, and many other type designers,
    myself included, were wrestling with the problem of getting the classic letterpress
    genre of text typefaces to look good in the high res environment. But it's not
    a simple task--making Jenson look good in successive waves of technology is the
    grail of typography.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the first digital typesetting machines, a foundry's fonts would only work on their
    own proprietary equipment. There was a rush alright, but the rush was to sell
    equipment, not so much fonts. You picked your machine by what your customers expected
    -- in terms of libraries, not so much individual fonts. So, our first digital
    machine was a Linotron 202 rather than a Monotype Videocomp, because the publishers
    we worked for wanted Linotype.\r\n\r\nI imagine the people doing the work preparing
    the photocomp and digital fonts were conscientious; it was the climate they worked
    in that was both rushed & overly concerned with the bottom-line. I remember when
    Linotype came out with the 54-unit-em system. They didn't change the sidebearings
    of letters from the 18-unit em, using the argument that their customers already
    had kerning tables based on the 18-unit em, & wouldn't want to change them.\r\n\r\nNow,
    not everybody kerned. Those who did were trying to make the type look better.
    Kerning then isn't what it is now; & while I can't speak for all the compositors
    in the 1980s, I think most of us would have welcomed the better letterfit that
    the 54-unit em allowed.\r\n\r\nWhen PostScript first came along I was so happy;
    with programs like (in spite of its bugs) Fontographer, type had finally been
    turned over to the end user.\r\n\r\nLess than two decades later, that is changing
    back, due to the complexities and licensing of OpenType.\r\n\r\nWhat has this
    to do with the thin-ness of Centaur? Well, the technical part has been brought
    out above. As to the future of print (excepting \"printing to the screen\"), we'll
    have to see. What will kill printed works is not so much customer's preferences
    in buying \"content,\" but those of us in the industry -- writers, acquiring editors,
    editors, designers, compositors, and printers, forgetting both our purpose and
    our craft."
