    I remember correctly those should all be available soon, through FontShop."

  body: 'Yes, I''m sure it is his work, but I''m unable to find any information about
    the faces or their availability.  I''m happy to hear that FontShop is releasing
    them. I couldn''t find anything on their site about it, so I guess I''ll wait
    and see. '

  body: An "upcoming" FontShop release was announced in Mexico IIRC, but sadly I don't
    remember the details. Perhaps Stephen or someone else from FontShop can offer
    more info.

  body: Missy - Indeed, FontShop will release the Ietswaart fonts. They are not quite
    complete yet, but nearly there. If your need is urgent perhaps we can work something
    out. <a href="http://fontshop.com/help/contact_us.php">Send us an email.</a>

  body: "Thanks, all! Very exciting news about the FontShop releases. I'm looking
    forward to it. No urgent needs, but many thanks for the offer, Stephen! I'm on
    your mailing list, so I'll be sure to check in. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I'm enjoying
    my search for nice upright scripts, and probably will go with something from the
    Sudtipos Charles Bluemlein collection. Any other suggestions are welcome, gracias!\r\n\r\n-Missy"
