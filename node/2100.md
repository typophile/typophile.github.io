  body: Richard, were you using Type Reunion? I don&#39;t think Type Reunion is compatible
    with Classic. However, you might try Action Utilities&#39; &#34;Action Wysiwyg&#34;.
    I think this is compatible with Classic. But, they haven&#39;t upgraded it quite
    a while, so it might also be incompatible with Panther.
