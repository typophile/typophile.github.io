    general, Brush Script is a typically overused and misused typeface."

    outline instead of outlining the whole thing.\r\nOn the other hand, I see this
    being the next cool \u2018purposely ugly\u2019 thing in graphic design."

  body: "It's from De Note Dop (\"The Nutshell\"), a local market trader in nuts and
    dried fruits. This is just part of their logo. Oddly enough they also use VAG
    Bold in their logo.\r\nRobert translated \"gewoon beter\" as \"normal better\",
    but I'd translate it as \"just better\", which still doesn't make any sense."
