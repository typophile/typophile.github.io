  on.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://certtime.com/sketches/layout-1.png>Option 1</a> is more
  of conventional columnized layout.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://certtime.com/sketches/layout-2.png>Option
  2</a> on the other hand is a fairly uncommon layout, which is however far less boring.
  It also seems to be more effective in content presentation as it is more compact
  without being busy or cluttered.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone agree ? Or is the second one
  too fancy for its own sake ?"

  body: "The second one is better, more typographic. I wouldn't call it really uncommon,
    though.\r\nStill, I would maintain some icons (but the one for \"in 15 seconds\"
    should have the hand horizontal)."

  body: "I like #2. I agree though that it's not all that uncommon; it just seems
    like a smart choice in this context. The rhetorical questions and very brief paragraphs
    seem to do a good job of drawing the viewer/reader in more quickly. The only thing
    that's very slightly bugging me is that the measure seems to be a tad on the longish
    side. Can you make that column a little bit narrower,* or the type a bit bigger?
    Barring both options, I might increase the leading a bit. But it's really not
    a big problem.\r\n\r\n* Don't let it get wider than this, in case this is a fluid
    layout."

  body: "I meant uncommon for a <em>tech website</em>. I have looked at dozens upon
    dozen sites and very few stray away from the straight-forward columnized layout.
    That's <em>if</em> they have a notion of a layout to begin with :-)\r\n\r\nRiccardo,
    I hear you regarding the icons, they add considerably to the site appearance.
    I just haven't decided where they should go yet. \r\n\r\nNina, I agree with regards
    to the width of the text column. I had this concern but decided not to mention
    it to see if someone else would bring it up.\r\n\r\nOne other change that I'm
    considering is to break the text into smaller sections like so - <a href=http://certtime.com/sketches/layout-3.png>Option
    3</a>.\r\n\r\n"

    [[http://certtime.com/sketches/v4-narrow.png|full-size sketch]] )\r\n\r\nI think
    it is starting to look pretty darn good :-) \r\n\r\nIt still needs work, especially
    in terms of making it look less \"dry\" and \"boring\", but otherwise I think
    the layout is both interesting and functional.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?"

  body: Ah, OK. It's flush <em>left</em> actually, that's why I asked. I hear you
    though, I will try both alignments once I have the copy finalized.

    everybody's attention. Make your business the front. I still do not know what
    that is. And without that I can not help you.

    The big empty banner is just a placeholder, it will get its presentation-style
    content a bit later on. "
