  a phrase like \"5-day forecast\"? Would just the \"5\" be in small caps or would
  \"5-day\" be in them?\r\n\r\nThoughts? A resource to direct me to? I checked The
  Elements of Typographic Style but couldn't find a specific answer to this."

  body: "I am having problems with the concept of small caps and numbers. Do you mean
    old style numbers? Small caps are, by definition, letters only. \r\n\r\nGenerally
    you will use old style numerals when you are using small caps. If the word DAY
    was in capitals otherwise, you would put it into small caps. If it was not, you
    would leave it lower case. What you want to avoid is a large group of consecutive
    full capital letters, which create a dark spot in the color of the page.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    this question would have fit into the General discussion forum, and you might
    want to repost it there. By now it would have had 100 responses, instead of my
    lonely, late one. This forum is more used for educational (think schools) issues,
    and rarely visited. "
