  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm mainly a web designer these days and quite happy with my MX Suite of Fireworks, Freehand and Dreamweaver. I really don't need anything else nor have any strong ambition to fork over more money to Adobe.

Not that I won't...eventually. FH is on its death bed, afterall.

But, in the interim, I still would like to be able to set Open Type fonts once in a while. Usually for working on a logo or graphic for a web site, so no need for InDesign.

As such, what are my DTP/Vector illustration apps that support OpenType options? Ideally for OSX. Any Open Source options? Or is it pretty much InDesign + Illustrator?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just as an update on Scribus' support for OpenType: I have a copy of v1.3.3.8 for Windows, and on this version the answer is that it's happy to <em>use</em> OpenType fonts, and it has a glyph palette for accessing all characters, as well as a menu item for inserting standard ligs, BUT it doesn't seem to apply OT features: ligatures aren't substituted automatically; if you apply small caps, superscript etc it just scales the regular characters like Word would; and there aren't any tools/options specifically about applying OT features.

Just so ya know. If anyone knows that <em>other</em> versions of Scribus behave differently, pipe up, of course!

It's not really a money issue. Call be stubborn. ;o)

Scribus...I had forgotten about that! Will take a look, though dtw claims that it may not work as intended.

Can pages export the type as vector? 

In the end, is Open Type really just an Adobe-Centric feature? </div>

I hope not. Its cross platform functionality is something really needed in the professional forum. 

However it may not become dominant in the home and office markets, where the need is less dire.</div>

Not necessarily, but Adobe so dominates the desktop publishing market that I’m not sure why many other companies would be in any hurry to support Opentype features. Designers are mostly using Indesign, and non-designers don’t really care. It makes sense for the open-source software crowd to support it, but they have pretty limited programming resources.</div>
