body: "I'm considering a condensed font for a corporate identity application. It's
  main uses would be the logotype (but this could also be regular width) on screen
  as headers and headlines, stationary materials (card, letterhead, envelopes, etc.),
  printed documents like one-page proposals and brief contracts (less than ten pages),
  and possibly some small format promotional materials.\r\n\r\nI like the character
  of the condensed version better than it's normal width sibling, and while I'm sure
  they could be used n combination quite effectivley, I'm wondering if I can pull
  it off with just the condensed width. It is available in a wide range of weights
  (thin, light, normal, semi-bold, bold, black, and extra black).\r\n\r\nThe two word
  logo will probably pair this font (but possibly in the regular width) with another
  font likely more of a thick brush stroke style.\r\n\r\nI'd like your opinions about
  the pros and cons of using a condensed font for a project of this nature, and really
  just some general feedback about condensed fonts and how they are used most effectivley.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n

  body: "I'm guessing you already have a font in mind form your post?\r\n\r\nWhile
    I see the benefit of having condensed fonts as part of a a family for a corporate
    font, I've never given it much consideration as part of the identity. I like identities
    to read well and to be useable at small sizes, something condensed or compressed
    fonts don't always do. I think it's fine to use condensed for small amounts of
    copy but would be leery of using it for a publication of several pages or more. "

  body: 'I do have a font in mind: Monitor by Our Type. I see your point about repro
    at small sizes. That''s why I was thinking the logotype should use the regular
    width. How much would you consider to be "small amounts of copy?" Headline, sentence,
    paragraph, page?'
