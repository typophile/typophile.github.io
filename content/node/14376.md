body: "TransType Pro\r\n\r\nTransType Pro converts fonts between PostScript Type 1,
  TrueType, Multiple Master, and OpenType. In seconds you can convert practically
  any font into any other format on Mac and PC.\r\n\r\nTransType supports batch conversion
  so users can convert hundreds of fonts at a time, even directly from Stuffit (.sit)
  archives. TransType Pro automatically adds some OpenType typographic features such
  as ligatures or fractions and supports Python scripting.\r\n\r\nMacintosh/Windows\r\n$179.00\r\n\r\nI
  found this at The PowerXChange. I don't know anything about it but I thought it
  might be useful for someone here."

  body: I hope the Pro version is more reliable than the "regular" version. I tried
    the Mac OS X demo on eight PC Postscript fonts. It converted five of them flawlessly
    (with the usual demo limitations) and created three junk files (OS X didn't recognize
    them as fonts). In baseball, .625 is an incredible batting average, but it's a
    pretty crummy one for software.
