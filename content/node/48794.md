    were designed earlier, and have had sustained usage.\r\n\r\nSo I would say, Laudatio
    (1982), which was quite popular at the time, but not much afterwards -- although
    it is presently being used by Tim Hortons."

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI third Insignia!  ;-D\r\n\r\nAnd I'd have to nominate
    Futura Condensed as a very '80s sans serif.  Yeah, I know it's been around and
    in use a long time, but it seemed to me that it was EVERYWHERE during the Me Decade.\r\n\r\nAvant
    Garde was still getting a lot of use, but to me that's a quintessentially '70s
    sans serif.\r\n\r\nHelvetica was everywhere too, but to me that doesn't exactly
    count because to most people back then, it was a \"default\" \"block style\" font.
    \ Heck, until the Mac made its debut in 1984 I had never heard of the word \"font\"
    except in the baptismal sense!  ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn the Fontaholic"

    closely on some student work from the first half of the 20th century, specifically
    from the Stuttgart School of Decorative Art. See page 105 of \"130 Alphabets &

  body: "> there\u2019s not much room to move within strict constraints.\r\n\r\nTrue,
    but there's a \"genetic\" difference between a constraint coming from a medium
    (lo-res screen) versus a constraint that somebody dreams up: unlike the former,
    the latter can possibly been inspired by another designer's work. As in \"Oh,
    that looks like an interesting constraint - let me see what I can do with that\".
    Unlike in bitmap fonts, Industria had no \"inherited\" constraints. That said,
    I do agree that Industria could very well be \"original\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
