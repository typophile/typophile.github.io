body: "I'm creating a return address stamp for a couple with last names beginning
  with C and A. We want the C to encircle the A, which is totally possible with many
  century-gothic type fonts, but I would like to find something a little more interesting.
  Does anyone know of a serif font with a perfectly round c? It doesn't matter if
  it's upper or lowercase.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    of the outside letter. You'll end up with a simpler shape, that's more elegant
    and easier to render nicely. BTW does the \"C\" have to be dominant? Assuming
    it's a typical western couple it's most probably better to avoid such hierarchy.\r\n\r\nOr,
    what about alluding to an @ sign?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Extended serif fonts might have a counter that approximates a circle. Something
    like Linotype's Kepler Extended or Canada Type's Clarendon Wide. Or a Copperplate
    Gothic if that counts as a serif.
