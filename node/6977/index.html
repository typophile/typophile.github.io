<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello people, I have just begun a course called "Digital Type" where I study. I have begun to create a typeface originally designed around the form of the numeral "2". This typeface has been created from scratch in three days, and I THINK it is going well, but I would deeply appreciate any critique you can give me. <br> <br>It was initially quite neoteric, a hard sans-serif. The spine (?) of the 2 reminded me of an art-nouveau style and I pursued that for a while. I became unsatisfied with its legibility and removed some elements of this "art nouveau" styling. I added some serifs and this is where I guess it is heading. It has all been very intuitive and based on a poor base-knowledge of typeface design. <br> <br>I intend to change the proportions of the O; next to the P it obviously doesn't work. I guess the art nouveau style will eventually completely dissapear in favour of legibility and unity. the perfect-circle O was inspired by art nouveau, but I have no particular reason to keep the style; it was just a stepping stone. <br> <br>Sorry for my post length. <br> <br>Shoot it to bits and i'll glue it back together in a better way.<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50399.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Christopher, <br> <br>this is not a bad start at all. <br> <br>Some first impressions and quick ideas: <br> <br>Where crossbars meet a stem (and anywhere else where two "pen strokes" come together under a sharp angle), ink traps are often a good feature to add in order to make a too heavy or "black" portion of a character optically lighter (if you don't know what an ink trap is, Google will easily find you an explanation). <br> <br>In your typeface, this mainly, but not exclusively, concerns the A and H. <br> <br>Compare, for instance, the A to the O. The A looks a tad heavier than the O, although stroke widths may be the same. This could be (at least partially) corrected by adding an ink trap in the appropriate place. <br> <br>Possibly the O Q D G bowls could use a tiny bit more weight. <br> <br>You surely are aware that, especially in typography, geometrical symmetry and measurements rarely equal optical symmetry and measurement and only the visual appearance of a character is of interest to the typographer. <br> <br>The bowls of you B, for instance, have the same dimensions, but the upper bowl appears to be both too high and long, disequilibrating the characters appearance. The B is top heavy and slightly tends to tip over to the right. <br> <br>The upper arm of your K seems to reach out a bit too far to the right. <br> <br>If you decide to retouch it anyway, you'd be able to judge more easily if the K should really be wider than the R with which it shares the "lower limbs". <br> <br>The horizontal symmetry in the D and C works uncommonly well in this typeface. <br> <br>The D's belly (which seems to be an exact copy of the C O Q bowl) looks almost a bit too pointy to me. <br> <br>About the same applies to the top/right heavy S. <br> <br>Besides that, the S lacks the typical features of the typeface and doesn't fit in very well. Look at your C and copy these spurs to the S. <br> <br>Round letters (C G O Q S in your typeface) tend to look too small when designed exactly as tall as the rest of the alphabet. The reason for this is, simply put, that a circle touches a tangent only in an infinitely small spot which has an effect on how tall we see a character. To compensate for this, the O, for instance, is often designed to reach over the lower and upper character grid line. <br> <br>The same is often true for pointed letters like A V W, where also few "optical mass" is near the lower or upper grid line. This does not apply to your typeface, though, since it features extended flat apices. <br> <br>I think the upper bar of the F and the T bar are a bit short. <br> <br>The Q tail shows a clearly more open and fluent and "forward" character than the nice sturdy legs of the R and K and I'm not sure whether that fits well together. Maybe try something like the R/K leg as the Q tail. <br> <br>I don't think that the O and P look bad next to each other. <br> <br>If you decide to keep the Art Nouveau touch and the quite special E F H, you might want to try to copy the A crossbar to the B (and R and even K and P). <br> <br>More could be said, but I leave that to others. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>Keep working on that typeface. <br> <br>See you <br>jpg <br> <br>PS: Maybe show us a small passage of text set in your typeface. I find it easier to judge a font in real use.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ugh. These are wearying to read long lines of text (a known issue in many forums). The line lenght corresponds with the dimension of the widest graphic in a thread. If you could post a graphic only 500 or 600 or so pixels wide the next time, the lines of surrounding text would be shorter and more comfortable to read. <br> <br>PS @ all: Temporarily blinding out graphics in your browser helps enormously! Of course it's not exactly the best of all imaginable solutions in a forum where text and graphic are so closely related. <br> <br>PPS @ Christopher: A type specimen is best viewed in PDF format.</div>

<div class=commentbody>&lt;font class="dontLookLikeCrap">jpg, <br> <br>Thanks heaps for the critique! The S is a particularly problematic glyph for the inexperienced. I should have mentioned that I have not yet made optical adjustments; I am trying to establish the base structure of the typeface. The R, B, K, and P used to use the curve crossbar form in their arms, legs and er... other limbs. However, all the curves everywhere created a wierd wobbly visual pathway. It was just for legibilitiy reasons I removed them. <br> <br>That being said, I do believe it will become a display face as I have no time to produce a lower-case. Therefore, I think it is important n hindsight to retain those parts that give it it's character. <br> <br>Sorry about the image width, that really was clumsy of me. I have seen a really great shockwave viewer somebody used for their typeface, and will probably create something similar with zooming and panning features... I'll definitely explore PDF as well. <br> <br>Thanks twice for the help; I think I am the only student here really pursuing the creation of typefaces, and you probably know how tutors have little time out of class. <br> <br>Well, I have alot of work to do now! <br> <br>- Chris&lt;/font></div>
