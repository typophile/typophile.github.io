body: It seems that Fontlab has become the standard font production software, but
  has anyone used the DTL Fontmaster modules? There seems to be such a high regard
  for their typefaces I'm curious if the software is equally good.

  body: "Just quickly, at 5 am ... The best thing would be to download the demo version,
    test it, and decide for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\nThree things that come
    to my mind: BezierMaster's bolding function gives better results than FLS's. The
    way the FontMaster modules deal with OT features is quite smart -- they generate
    a font-specific feature file from a big one and omit specific substitutions if
    required glyphs are missing in the font. Also, you only need to set up a .cha
    file (which links glyph IDs, glyph names, Unicode codepoints) once and do not
    need to care for these things any more."

  body: Thanks Stephen. I would love to hear from other users. Any other benefits
    or disadvantages? I'm a graphic designer just starting to dabble with type design.
    I'm thinking Typetool to start, but want to consider my options down the road.

    I think you can do (technically) good and bad fonts with all font editors (especially
    since there are no clear-cut definitions for good and bad). It may be unavoidable
    to read some technical papers so that you know what you are doing if you mark
    any checkbox -- in any font editor."

  body: Karsten, you're absolutely right about that. It's not so much the tools, but
    how you use them. I agree.

  body: "Like Simon wrote, if everything goes well I will definitely organize a FM
    Track in St. Petersburg coming Autumn. In the meantime I will provide some info
    here. \r\n\r\nFM is especially developed with batch production in mind. The separation
    of glyph, naming and metrics info, the way the generation of OT features is handled
    and the character mapping files (which like Karsten wrote, link glyph IDs, glyph
    names, Unicode codepoints and code pages) in combination with command files makes
    it possible to come up with reproducible and consistent results. \r\n\r\nMost
    of the files are easy to alter text files. Changes in a character mapping file
    or features file can be applied to a complete library at once by using command
    files. Or, if FM is updated (like at the moment to version 2.7.0 with the 2.0
    SDK built-in), all fonts can be generated again in batch. \r\n\r\nAt DTL we use
    a hierarchic system for the command files. I tried to explain some of the stuff
    in my presentation in Brighton last September, for which I used the following
    PDF:\r\nhttp://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/FM_docs/FM_Easy_automation.pdf\r\n\r\n"

  body: Frank, thanks for the .pdf. I am definitely a beginner at this point. It looks
    like Fontmaster may be more advanced than what I need. I did download the lite
    version, and will try it out. My goal this year is to create a few display types
    to get started. Thanks for the reply. - Chris
