  body: "Q: \"why it's NOT Helvetica.\"\r\nA: At least five letters, _G_ with no spur,
    _R_ with straight leg, and  _C_, _D_ and _O_ with a vertical section in the curved
    strokes. The letter _S_ could pass for Helvetica, Arial etc.\r\nThe letters have
    some similarities to DIN, except for the _S_.\r\nMight not be a standard font.\r\nDon"

  body: These letters look like they were probably made by architects or engineers,
    not type designers. My bet is not a font.
