body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been looking for this font the past few days.  The closest
  I&#39;ve gotten is Rockwell, Memphis, Lubalin Graph, and that one Geometric font,
  but they&#39;re not exact matches.  Observe the double-story lc a, the lc y, and
  many of the other glyphs have a &#34;softer&#34; feel to them than the &#34;square&#34;
  slabs I listed. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66021.gif"
