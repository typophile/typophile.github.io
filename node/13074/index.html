		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh Tiffany, there are some really wonderful, wonderful places. Here are my favorites:</p>
<p>Argosy has a little of everything and is always worth a visit. 116 E 59th (at Lexington, I think, or else Park).</p>
<p>J. N. Bartfield at 30 W 57th is excellent.</p>
<p>Bauman Rare Books at 535 Madison is good.</p>
<p>The Manhattan Rare Book Co. at 1050 2nd in the big antique market there sometimes has nice things and specimen books, mostly modern firsts though</p>
<p>Barbara Leibowitz Graphics has lots of illustrated books, posters and other ephemera and v. good prices. She only shows via appointment though but I am sure you can find her online. A lot of the better dealers in NYC will only show via appointment but the good ones will be very happy to talk to you and show you what they have.</p>
<p>Gotham Book Mart is still fun. 16 E 46th.</p>
<p>Leonard Fox has a lot of modern rare stuff, incl. some art and ceramic work in his gallery, and specializes in art nouveau / deco and fashion. He&rsquo;s at 790 Madison.</p>
<p>Black Sun Books at 157 E 57th is terrific.</p>
<p>James Cummins at 699 Madison is very good.</p>
<p>Svetlana Aronov was very good. She died recently and I am not sure if someone else has taken over her business, but she had a really excellent and varied stock with probably the best stock of Russian avant-garde stuff anywhere.</p>
<p>Ursus Books is very popular, at 981 Madison (upstairs). They have a big stock, nice bright room, obsequious staff who know their stuff.</p>
<p>Martayan Lan is in the Heron Tower at 70 E 55th, several floors up. Lots of maps, and an excellent collection of rare books, mostly history of science and things like that, some incunabula.</p>
<p>I have never been to visit Richard Ramer but he has a HUGE holding of rare books on a tremendously wide variety of subjects. I will visit him on this trip I think. 225 E 70th. He specializes in books on Portugal, Spain, Latin America, Brazil, Africa and Asia.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">When I was last there in 1999, <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/home/OAKLANDERBOOKS/">Oaklander Books</a> was the best source of secondhand and antiquarian type books I visited. It is over by Chelsea, in an upstairs room in a warehouse/studio building. It is best to call ahead to ensure they are open; I don&rsquo;t think they keep very regular hours, and most of their business is by catalogue and Internet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks to both of you. &ndash; I&rsquo;m actually, sort of, in conversation with Oaklander and do hope they are the final group, but if that doesn&rsquo;t work I am looking for an alternative.</p>
<p>JLT &ndash; Amazing list of booksellers. This thread should be added to a thread about what to do when in the big apple.</p>
