  body: "Every couple of months we do a DeVinne/Romana ID. In terms of making  a digital
    match for this particular T shirt I think the Hawthorn variation is the closest
    match, if stretched as I suggested in my previous post. At least that's what I
    would use if I wanted to duplicate the T shirt lettering.\r\nDon"
