    sense of history. If it doesn't smack of now it isn't relevent. Right!

    Cooper stuff seems to vibe on Fast & Furious movies, homicidal X-box games like
    TOCA race driver -- Bold extended font like Porsche logo, Pirelli from way back,
    more recently a standard on chrome auto badges."

    for Cooper Tires?

    laziness have picked fonts to match the project based on font names. Eg a restaurant

  body: "This was posted an another forum a couple of weeks ago. the new logo conveys
    nothing to me. It doesn't really say tires, or much of anything for tat matter.
    If their site is a reflection of their taste in design, the logo is rather fitting;
    ill but fitting. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's just me but I find a number of new logo's
    for large companies fall far short of good identities. "

  body: "@jselig:\r\n<cite>the new logo conveys nothing to me.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe old
    logo said that tires were fat (Cooper Black) and that they protect your safety
    (the knight's helmet).\r\n\r\nThe new logo says that their tires help you go fast
    (the italic letters) - and the spiral logo of elliptical shape reinforces that."

    was deleted. Sometimes the spammers surface interesting threads, sometimes they
    don't.
