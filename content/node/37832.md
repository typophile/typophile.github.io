  use for some years now, so that\u2019s not changing any time soon (to my knowledge).\r\nHowever,
  the strapline \u2018Time to Discover\u2019 is a new addition.\r\n\r\nIn order to
  bring some 'relational' warmth to the CXP logo, we've attempted to go down the handwritten
  route. What do you think of these three routes?\r\n\r\n- First option is using a
  font, 'SF Scribbled Sans' - a free download from 1001fonts.com.\r\n\r\n- Second
  and Third options are (digitally) handdrawn with Wacom and Illustrator CS3\r\n\r\nYour
  feedback (positive or negative), would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCarl\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cxp_ttd_example_3584.jpg]"

    words why is the cross falling down when all other elements are \"perfectly set\"\r\n\r\ni
    dont think any of the choices enhance the logo but if i were forced to make a
    choice i would go with the second option\r\n\r\n\r\ngood luck\r\n"

    because of the tiny 'o's and curvy 'd'. I'd watch the kerning between \"me\" in
    \"Time\" though, and I'd suggest adding a dot to the 'i'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Message to 'elms':\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback re. the second option.\r\n\r\nIn
    response to your question, \u2018why are you disrepecting the very thing you are
    trying to promote?\u2019\r\n\r\nFirstly as Sharon pointed out, I didn't design
    the Christianity Explored logo, and it is not currently up for change, as I mentioned
    in my original post. But even if I had designed it, I would have no problem with
    representing the cross like that. I think most Christians would agree it does
    not disrepect the Lord Jesus to show the cross at an angle, or even 'falling down'.
    The Lord Jesus himself fell down whilst carrying his cross to be crucified. We
    Christians believe it was the most amazing act of courage and self-sacrificial
    love this world has ever seen. And according to Jesus' own words in the Bible
    (John chapter 3 verse 16 to 36, for example), the way to disrespect him is not
    by how we visually represent his cross, rather it is to continue in unbelief,
    refusing to turn from our sin and accept him as Lord and follow him. I did that
    for many years myself, until 3.5 years ago he saved me by his amazing grace. Check
    out www.needgod.com / www.twowaystolive.com for further information. May he bless
    you too, in his name, Carl."

    about the kerning on the E.\r\n\r\nVery sadly the client seems to have decided
    on the first option, which I never would have presented, but it came via the back
    door through the web designers."

    that you were not the designer of the logo.\r\nAnd I respect that one can interpret
    the cross as one sees fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust that you will continue to walk in
