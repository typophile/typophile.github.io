<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've been giggling all throughout the holidays waiting until I could post this. GUESS what fell into my lap <br> <br>Clue 1) the only date I could find was 1912, pre-ISBN's here. <br>Clue 2) This company closed in the 1930s <br>Clue 3) 1096pgs of cast-type average sets priced at $3.50 <br> <br>A friend found it at a library garage sale picked it up for 25 cents and brought it over thinking I'd be interested. His boss is googling over it too and has entertained the idea of re-printing it not as a working catalogue but for collectors. I suggested that that was blasphemy, not to mention the impossibilities of re-printing it to any collectors stardards.

<div class=commentbody>I'm still laughing over Mr. Coles' mind control techniques. <br> <br>ATF Specimen Books are a regular hot item on eBay. If you got it for 25cents, you've lived what the rest of us dream about. You've probably saved about a hundred bucks by finding at a garage sale. <br> <br>From what I understand, the 1923 ATF Book is the one to get. <br> <br>Reprinting it would be useless... Although I've been very,very, tempted to preserve it, digitally so that people could browse it here online. Not sure if that would be legal or not. <br> <br>Where's an intern when you need one? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>over my dead body. You don't realize how often I check that the oven, toaster, & lamps are unplugged before I leave house - but I will scan as much as I can before the authority's arrive. <br> <br>>1. How could reprints be a collector's item? <br>I asked the same thing...he's thinking about having each and every page drum-scanned-orama. I would certainly like a copy if he re-printed...its just so much fun to read. They didn't use Lorem back then...all the specimens have clever little paragraphs worded to sell the ATF, and then a different para in 8pts, and again in 7pts, 6pts...on and on</div>

<div class=commentbody>Congratulations, Tanya. Two bits? What a steal. <br>Jared's right, though, the 1923 specimen is the holy grail. The others are pre-Morris Fuller Benton. <br> <br>As interesting as it would be, I can't imagine there would be any way to justify the expense of a reprint. Real collectors probably wouldn't be interested in a facsimile. The potential market would actually be very small. And drum-scanning 1000+ page? I suppose your boss could be an eccentric, wealthy bibliophile. <br> <br>Jared, the maximum protection offered by U.S. copyright is 75 years. Any copyright on the 1923 book would have expired in 1998 (and that's assuming they filed the proper extension after the first 26 years). So, if you've got the time and the server space, go ahead. <br> <br>-- K. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I bought one of the 1923 ones a couple of years ago and I've wanted to add it to <a href=http://exhibits.itchyrobot.com/>this</a> (kind of my own, poor man's Ocatvo) for a while. Taking and naming the pictures is quite tedious though, and I'm not completely happy with how the books that I've already done came out. <br>Maybe if I rig up a home-made photo stand and write a couple of perl scripts I could get it done a little more easily.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice Graham. I do like the format and the fact that they're <br>photographed, not flattened and scanned. No it's not <br>Octavo, but that level of effort is for people with lots of <br>time and/or aging to do. <br> <br>Perhaps you could periodically throw in close-ups of the <br>juicy stuff instead of feeling like you have to dump huge <br>files on the web.

This book is easily worth $100, and in very good to excellent condition, much more. Most of the specimen books from the major metal foundries are worth this at minimum. The ATF were quite plentiful and are still relatively easy to obtain. <br> <br>Who places this value? people who value them and are willing to pay the the going rate to get them. The last specimen book I bought cost $250, an Enschede, and it was quite a bargain at that. <br> <br>I'd be a bit more careful about copying this and then distributing the results in public. Several parties still have legal interests in ATF, including some of the major digital foundries. And we all despise theft don't we? <br> <br>Gerald</div>

<div class=commentbody>In my mail on Saturday I received the recent issue of _Printing History_. Having just opened the package, image my surprise when I see that the entire issue is dedicated to ATF and includes a showing of the exhibition "Type to Print: The Book & The Type Specimen Book." Based on the significant holdings of the ATF library, which is now housed at Columbia University. <br> <br>Revealed here is the cost of the 1923 specimen book. 60,000 copies were issued at a production cost of $300,000. <br> <br>Gerald</div>

And we all despise <br>>theft don't we? <br> <br>Gerald, I don't think Graham can reasonably be expected to take responsibility for any potential "theft" of these designs. The specimen book itself is clearly in the public domain, since anything published before 1978 has a maximum protection of 75 years from date of publication. <br> <br>There may indeed be parties still with legal interests in the assets of ATF, such as they are. I don't know what the standing might be on any of the patents ATF may have held for any of its type designs. But the published book is no longer protected by copyright, and I think Graham has done an admirable service in giving those unfortunates who have not had the opportunity a glimpse into this fabled beast. <br> <br>-- K. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent <br> <br>The copyright on the ATF specimen book would only have been valid for 28 years, with the possibility of extending it for another 28 if ATF chose to do so. They did issue a much slimmer specimen book in the fifties, their last. <br> <br>Copyright is not the concern. And I'm not sure if patents were ever successfully extended to metal type designs. I know copyright could not be. <br> <br>The copyright law does not cover reproduction rights in entirety though, does it. Copyright law more specifically protects intellectual and creative rights, not design elements. Nothing is ever "clearly" in public domain. The remote possibility of existing trademarks and registration legalities are more of a concern here. These would pass on to those parties who acquired the assests of the firm. Much as your logo there (nice by the way) if trademarked and/or registered, would legally pass on to your heirs, with full rights and protection under the law. <br> <br>It wouldn't really matter in the eyes of the law that Graham has provided an "admirable service" if someone who had the legal right to challenge his efforts chose to do so. <br> <br>Gerald</div>

I remember Frank Martinez saying that he had been unable to identify the typeface, despite an extensive search in the Patent Office archives. <br> <br>I don't think it is 'very telling', since plenty of non-pi typefaces have received patent protection since.

<div class=commentbody>> What's your source? <br> <br>Hmmm. I don't remember. Maybe Lawson. <br> <br>Anyway, I can assure you it's true. In fact I vividly remember a discussion we had during the Boston ATypI conference, with you, me, Spiekermann, and others, during a Q&A of a presentation by Martinez. We were sitting on the right side of the hall, I think Erik was on the 2nd row (more to the right), I was on the sixth or so, and you were right in front of me (two rows forward). The row between us was empty. I even remember using the term "fitting" back then as well, and noticed Erik nodding and smiling when I said it. And you were explaining how a design patent is fine for a font, because unlike a regular patent it doesn't require "conceptual abstraction". I remember where a bunch of other people were sitting too: Carter and Shaw on the first row on our side, Licko on the third on the left side, Lemon on the first row (aisle) on the left... <br> <br>And in fact we had a "rematch" in Leipzig, after Hollandsworth's presentation, remember? :-) <br>That time I was less shy... <br> <br>But for some reason I still can't remember a source! :-/ <br> <br>> plenty of non-pi typefaces have received patent protection since. <br> <br>Yes, and knowledge of world geography has been dropping steeply the last few decades as well... <br> <br>> should appeal to someone who is concerned with 'craft'. <br> <br>But the part of me that thinks it's a distraction from <i>proper</i> protection (copyright) protests too loudly. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant <br> <br>I recall reading about a legal decision that went something like this: You can't patent the alphabet. <br> <br>Other than the interrobang (not exactly successful), the backward slash (I suspect Bill owns that), and the euromark (hmmm), there just hasn't been much accomplished recently.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant writes:<i>But the part of me that thinks it's a distraction from proper protection (copyright) protests too loudly.</i> <br> <br>I think, for people like Adobe who regularly seek patent protection for their new typefaces, it is a case of taking whatever protection is on offer. I agree that the existence of design patent protection makes it possible for the US Copyright Office to shrug off demands for copyright protection: 'Take your typeface across the road to the Patent and Trademark Office. They'll look after you'. But not availing oneself of the available protection isn't going to stir the Copyright Office's heart either. <br> <br>In response to Gerald: the USA offers design patent protection for typeface design. It does not offer copyright protection; this was confirmed in the Esselte vs. Ringer case (note, however, that I'm aware of at least two analyses of the case, written by lawyers, that suggest the case was poorly argued and the decision in error). Unlike copyright protection, a design patent must be actively sought (it is not automatic), the review process is more rigorous (for example, you have to provide exhaustive examples of prior art that may have influenced the design), and is for a much more limited period of time (I can't remember what it is in the US; the Canadian equivalent is Industrial Design Protection, which is for 14 years). <br> <br>Some other countries provide copyright protection for typeface design, and the sky hasn't fallen yet.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>Nothing is ever "clearly" in public domain.</i> <br> <br>Gerald, surely you didn't mean this statement literally. There are plenty of creations which are indisputably in the public domain. The melody which many of us know as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" (or the alphabet song) is in the public domain; I need no one's permission to write a song based on it. Shakespeare's plays are in the public domain; I don't need anyone's permission to publish my own copy of his text. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is in the public domain; I don't need any one's permission to paint my own copy of it. The creative merits of such an act may be debatable, but the legality is not. (Unless I try to pass my copy off as the original, in which case it's fraud; but that's another legal matter.) <br> <br>Intellectual property right protections do not last forever. <br> <br>(It should be noted, however, that any given photograph of the Mona Lisa may not be in the public domain, so I can't just go around indiscriminately reproducing someone else's *photo* of the painting.) <br> <br><i>>The remote possibility of existing trademarks and <br>>registration legalities are more of a concern here. These would pass <br>>on to those parties who acquired the assests of the firm. </i> <br> <br>Yes, you make a good point. Aside from copyright and patent, there are trademark considerations. But, as with patents, U.S. trademark registration is also a very restricted protection. A period of three years of non-use may be enough for a mark to be considered abandoned, unless acceptable reasons are given and the proper papers are filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. I don't know if Kingsley-ATF did this or not. <br> <br>But I believe that this protection would extend only to the ATF name and logo, and probably some of the actual names of typefaces, presuming they were properly registered. I don't think there is any aspect of the specimen that could qualify for protection as "trade dress." And merely reproducing the logo is not necessarily sufficient to constitute infringement, especially if the reproduction is in the context of the company's own publication. <br> <br>>It wouldn't really matter in the eyes of the law that Graham has <br>>provided an "admirable service" if someone who had the legal right to <br>>challenge his efforts chose to do so. <br> <br>Granted. My comment wasn't meant as a legal defense. <br> <br>But let's review: I think we've established and agreed that the book itself is no longer protected by copyright. There is a slim chance that some of the typefaces shown may have been granted a U.S. patent, but (as I think John noted) that protection has probably expired; and, regardless, merely reproducing the showings would not violate patent protection. Finally, trademark protection, if any still applies, would only cover the names and the logo; and I maintain that publishing the images of the specimen on the web would not constitute trademark infringement. <br> <br>But -- correct me if I'm wrong -- I get the impression that your initial concern was not so much with Graham's right to reproduce the specimen pages, as with what others might do with the images. If so, I contend that we can not reasonably hold Graham responsible for these possibilities, any more than we hold libraries responsible because they make their collections accessible and provide public photocopiers. If there is any subsequent infringement on the rights of ATF's successors by someone swiping a typeface design, then I think that lies squarely on the "swiper". <br> <br>[Standard Disclaimer: I'm not a licensed IP attorney, etc., etc.] <br> <br>-- K. <br> <br>P.S. Way to go on the ATF and BB&S books. Great story!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent <br> <br>Very thoroughly reasoned. I guess my initial reaction was to the idea that you can just reproduce whatever you want simply because it is no longer copyrighted and I was trying to point out there may be other factors to consider. <br> <br>In a book I did a while back we had to enter hyphens in the names of characters used by Kipling in his Just So Stories because we discovered a famous movie producer had trademarked the names for toy marketing. Our legal advice was to copyright the hyphens as "additional material." Kipling's work was certainly in public domain but there was also a Kipling Museum trust which still owned certain properties. <br> <br>What am I saying is you can't be too careful, and you can be at considerable risk. If you run a small business, a cease and decease or any other kind of legal threat could quickly drain your financial resources and put you out of business, whether or not the threatening action had legal merit. You would have to prove otherwise and that is costly. If you are doing anything of a "publishing" nature you do need to run this all through legal search (trademark, copyright, etc). <br> <br>Thanks for the information.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul <br> <br>I'd say yes, copyright is for intellectual property, the sequencing of letterforms, not their visual representation. <br> <br>But trademark can actually be both. If I use the term Adobe Systems in a book I am required to either indicate trademark or print a disclaimer regarding trademark. One would not have to follow this in most cases, in discourse intended for a public audience, such as reviews or criticism, as Adobe is a recognized public name and has, in fact, sought that out. <br> <br>But I can also not copy the visual representation of the Adobe logo without their permission, whether or not I intend to use this for commercial purposes, and I believe this is where your post may be in error. <br> <br>Registration of name is more tricky because it can be legislated by state.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, <br> <br>I was not talking about tradmarks for logos or company names. My point was that the typefaces displayed in the ATF book are not an issue; the typefaces are what most of the discussion was about. The trademark on a particular typeface only prevents you from making another typeface based on it; there is no restriction on how the letter shapes are used in other media.</div>

It was about possible infringement for reproducing the pages from the book, which happens to be a type specimen book. <br> <br>I think Kent's remarks were the clearest regarding the legalities of all of this. And I doubt anyone would argue against your point about the usage of a legally acquired typeface. <br> <br>It's mainly been a problem of the trademark of a typeface "name" though hasn't it, rather than the design per se? Someone reissuing someone's elses typeface with a different name? I recall that Adobe goes through extraordinary lengths to ensure that when they issue an original typeface, the name they choose is quite free and clear.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tanya <br> <br>Nightmares, huh! Maybe you are right. Those little feets are made for walking. And those little faces are just dying to be made up with ink. Maybe. <br> <br>Know of a good home with really deep pockets?</div>
