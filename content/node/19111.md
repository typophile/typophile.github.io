  body: Tim-- I think your definitions make sense. If you look at the Ramus illustration,
    which is part of an academic text that was written in Latin and certainly heavily
    influenced by the Latin conventions, the curly guys do look (a) fairly consistent
    and formalized, and (b) like arms "embracing" a cluster of terms, which is exactly
    what Ramus' taxonomical stuff was meant to do-- traditional Aristotelian analysis
    of phenomena into types, such that a particular category X "embraces" a set of
    sub-categories. I really need to look into this more!

  body: "It's silly to include Braces as a standard-encoding digital font character,
    because they are not used on the same line as other characters, and would be put
    in a separate text box if used at all. So an all-braces font makes a lot of sense.
    \r\n\r\nBraces are all too heavy in digital fonts, and I include my own, but I'm
    just following precedent to match their weight to that of the square brackets
    and parentheses, as sort of an ornate alternative to the square bracket, in fact.\r\n\r\nWhenever
    I have had to set braced material, I have always used the component-system that's
    part of the Symbol font."

    see what you're saying, but lots of scripting and programming languages use them
    as standard glyphs. Ok, maybe that doesn't seem to matter much from the perspective
    of artful typography, except there are often times when you want to include a
    snippet in some document you're writing. Like if I want to define a style in CSS
    and explain how, I'd be writing...\r\n\r\n.style {\r\ncolor=blue\r\n}\r\n\r\nThat's
    just the standard syntax. For large braces, such as those use in mathematics,
    I agree that you need a different kind of tool. To some extent, LaTex provides
    that as part of its raison d'etre.\r\n\r\n\r\n- J"

  body: "<em>lots of scripting and programming languages use them as standard glyphs.</em>\r\n\r\nPoint
    taken. It's a question of priorities and power -- although 99% of typefaces would
    never be used for programming, the character had to be there (along with a bunch
    of higher math characters), because programmers called the shots for the basic
    character set. Glyphs that are typographically useful in a great many more fonts
    -- the f ligatures -- were excluded."

    the f ligatures \u2014 were excluded.\r\n\r\nAnd point taken here, in return.
    In fact, once I discovered the whole world of typography (not that long ago actually)
    and got my hands on InDesign, I became frustrated that so few ligatures and alternates
    are to be found. I suspect that as time goes on, though, there may be some equalization--
    more and more fonts will come with the serious type options as standard components.
    And someday brackets, arrows, lines, etc.-- all the sort of 'metatypographical'
    stuff that is so important-- may become built in such that \"inline\" type arrangement
    in programs like InDesign will be useful enough to make workarounds like separate
    drawings and text-boxes less necessary. Pipe dream, mayb."
