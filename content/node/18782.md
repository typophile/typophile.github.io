body: "The teachers at my school have asked us students to recommend three typefaces
  (families), as they are looking to expand their (meager) library on the school's
  computers.. and you all here seem to be very handy in recommending fonts when someone
  is looking for a good alternative to this and that font, so I'd just love for you
  all to inspire me to find three nice families to recommend.\r\n\r\nI was thinking
  I'd recommend a serif text font, a sans serif and a more fanciful display font (not
  necessarily House Industries fanciful, but more exotic and unique). Preferrably
  all available in Opentype formats.\r\n\r\nOh, and they have many of the standard
  classics (Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni, Bookman, Franklin Gothic, Futura, Palatino,
  Gill Sans, Helvetica, etc.) so I was thinking I'd recommend some more new and not
  quite as common fonts. They should be fairly broad in usability though since they'd
  be used for students on all kinds of projects.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!"

      i highly doubt it. hopefully they can at least get some new faces, though, even
      if it'll end up being smaller families.\r\n\r\nanyway, all those three you recommended
      are definitely interesting. i really like the Gotham typeface, so thanks for
      the reply!"

    foundries who have educational discounts. I would email the foundries who have
    the typefaces you/they would most like to license and ask if they have any discounts
    for education. You should also consider CD collections insead of just families.
    For instance, <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/fonts.html\">Storm Type Foundry</a>
    has the several different collections which has a bevy of differenty typefaces."

      because i just earlier thought about whether foundries offer educational discounts
      or not. you'd think many do, but i have no idea since i've never been in the
      position of buying fonts that way. they should definitely see if they can find
      discounts, but maybe they already do that. i'll certainly mention it to them,
      so thanks for the tip.\r\n\r\ni'll do check for collections too, that might
      be more ideal for them.. more fonts for less money. even if those fonts might
      not have the most amount of styles, it's not really like they need to buy a
      family that has 50 different styles."

    thread</a> just now, although i do still want everyone's recommendations for those
    three fonts/families. it's always great to find out about fonts you hadn't encountered
    before.. so keep 'em coming, please!

    IM Fell</a>: free Baroque text and display fonts, at least one of which (Van Dijck''s
