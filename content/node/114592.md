  body: "Strange case \u2026 maybe this is the typeface Secretary by ParaType:\r\nhttp://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Secretary.htm\r\nIt
    is similar to ITC American Typewriter. In the 1990s ITC commissioned several designers
    to design Cyrillics for their library. Some typefaces were released, but others
    were not, but that\u2019s another story. According to various sources ITC American
    Typewriter was designed by Victor Kharyk. I could not find a foundry selling it,
    but maybe you have more luck than I had."

    is the core English charset from ITC American Typewriter Medium:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCAmericanTypewriterMed_5400.jpg]\r\nHere
    is the core English charset from Paratype's Secretary Regular:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SecretaryEng_3711.jpg]\r\nNote
    that Secretary is similar but not identical to ITC American Typewriter Medium.
    In addition to differences in glyph outlines, the x height is lower.\r\nHere are
    the Cyrillic letters from Secretary Regular:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SecretaryCyr_3836.jpg]\r\nAre
    they an exact match with the sample?\r\nDon"
