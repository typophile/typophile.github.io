  image?\r\n\r\nThe 'logo' was embossed in metallic ink on the catalog, so it made
  for a terrible scan. Hopefully it will do some justice.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: That was quick! So what do you think Bald, is it? I noticed that it's not
    available for purchase/download right?

  body: "Per Philippe of the MyFonts forum, <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Opti</a> offered a digital version of Basilea (but good luck
    dealing with Castcraft). Also per Philippe, Les Usherwood's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/alexon-rr/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Alexon</a> was a later creation based on Basilea.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I see now that these same options are cited in another recent thread. It's Basilea
    time, eh?"

  body: Yeah, it's really bizarre. Somehow these three threads converged yesterday.
    There must be something in the air...
