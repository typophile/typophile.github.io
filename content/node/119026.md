  body: "Well, since Garamond 3 is based on American Garamond, not bad guesses on
    both our counts.\r\n\r\nThe book was first published in 1940, but without knowing
    the date of the sample above, hard telling if it was set in the older typeface
    or the newer one (Garamond 3 was released in 1936, so it is a distinct contender)."

  body: The example submitted to us is the title page of the first edition of 1940
    - so Garamond 3 is well within the time span. I think we both have got it Kevin.

  body: "thanks, everyone! i think that's it...but the letterforms are more condensed
    here than any digital version i can find. the M especially. maybe that's just
    the metal redrawn as digital. there's a blackness to it that i can't seem to replicate
    either (also likely due to metal vs. digital), but i wish it could! \r\n\r\nthanks
    again. "

  body: The quality of the printing (blanket pressure, ink coverage) and the quality
    of the paper both influence how type reproduces on the page. There may be drawing
    differences between metal and digital, but too much ink/too much pressure/poor
    quality paper can all fatten up a typeface.
