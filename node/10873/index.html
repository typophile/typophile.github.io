They went and Chisel extruded some metallic grey text and then drop-shadowed it onto a red background. Its like all of a sudden British design is taking its influences from American banks and Bling-Bling Rap albums. Next thing you know, The Royal Bank of Scotland will Diamonte-encrust its logo or something. Hideous. So much for the reputation&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If Rand wasn't happy with it, then why dwell on it? Obviously he did not like it. And I would tend to agree with his opinion first. It was a poor decision for UPS to accept the first logo and similar dedcision making on this new one too. <BR> <BR>I don't care for the new one either, but the string HAD to go. When was the last time any of us saw a package with string? In the industry that UPS and FEDEX are in I can see how any reference to the &quot;old&quot; or &quot;archaic&quot; would be a bad thing. No matter how much we as designers may like the traditional. <BR> <BR>But I am interested to see how they translate the new logo to one color printing. Or even two color. That element of Rand's original that made the old logo so universal. <BR> <BR>I had also heard that the reason that UPS went with the color brown in the first place was legal. I forget the details I heard, but UPS was required (legally somehow) to &quot;down-play&quot; their presence. Can anyone recall this legal issue?</div>

But in my opinoin, it could be a lot worse (Verizon). </i> <BR> <BR>Funny, FutureBrand claims fame to the Verizon logo. <BR> <BR>I think the bow and parcel concept and its reason to change, being &quot;outdated&quot; is retarded.  The string, bow and parcel weren't used in the first place because Rand or UPS beleived that's the way they delivered packages. Its because its a &quot;gift&quot; and relates to the emotional level of receiving a delivery. Saying it was outdated to logistics is like re-designing Col. Saunders head shot with a business suit and tie,  giving him plastic surgery because he looks old. Its all irrelevant, and ignores their corporate values.  <BR> <BR>(cleaned my cookies, lazy - going anon, but its me Tanya)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Verizon logo really is the worst. And you can't get away from it. The throw-away attitude about design among major U.S. companies like UPS and Verizon is such a dramatic contrast with the Netherlands, where it seems like every square inch of the country has been well thought out and artfully designed. (Not to slight any other Euros, it's one of the few European countries I've visited.) Payphones, grocery stores, public toilets, sidewalks&hellip; they're all beautiful in their attention to detail and their functionality. That was my impression, anyway.</div>
