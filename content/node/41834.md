  more important to actually know someone in the industry or who works in a company?
  or do companies judge by looking at portfolios first? I noticed that it's most important
  to know someone whether it's an instructor, classmate, friend, etc. So if that's
  the case, why should we have a portfolio in the first place? \r\n\r\nAlso, does
  anyone know how to get any experience when companies say '2-5 years experience'
  because there's no way any designer will get that experience coming out of design
  school."

    and who you want to work for. In a town with more jobs than designers, you can
    find a good job just by submitting a portfolio in response to a Craigslist ad.
    But go to one of the cities where prospective designers far outstrip the jobs,
    and you\u2019d better know somebody. And really great design firms that every
    kid coming out of school wants to work for might just ignore anybody who isn\u2019t
    recommended by some third part acting as a scum filter. Of course, the are exceptions
    to any situation; a great portfolio and persistence might land you a job at a
    firm that isn\u2019t even hiring to begin with. \r\n\r\nThat said, there\u2019s
    not really any downside to networking. I\u2019ve never walked away from an AIGA
    function without at least having a good conversation."

    foot in the door for an interview (this is also where coming from an \"established\"
    art school can help \u2013\_whatever that means\u2026).\r\n\r\nBut these things
    will not get you the job. That depends on you and your portfolio. They have to
    want both to make you a permanent offer\r\n\r\nOn the whole, for the first job,
    I'd say that it really is what you can do, not who you know. Your portfolio and
    abilities will be the biggest help in you getting your first real jobs. But a
    few years down the line, it will become more and more about who you know. Many
    of the really great jobs aren't publicly advertised. They just get filled through
    contacts. So when you are working, it is important to get to know a lot of people
    outside of your studio or office, maybe join some local design oganizations, etc.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the 2\u20133 years experience\u2026 um, that's a \"for real\" requirement.
    You've got to build that up somehow. When I was in college, I spent three summers
    interning with design studios, and I also spent four semesters working as a part-time
    intern at other design studios. This builds up your time, resume, and portfolio.
    Plus, it was a lot of fun, and it paid me, too."

    in an ad. Those people don't want someone coming out of design school. They want
    someon with 2-5 years experience.\r\n\r\nPlaces don't advertise for rookies. If
    you are a rookie, you go to them. Drop off portfolios, resumes, and network all
    you can. Offer to work for free a day a week at a studio you would like to get
    into. Be prepared to do mindless jobs like photo copying. Even listing your part
    time placement at that studio will mean something to a prospective employer (including
    getting another good reference contact). This assumes that you do a good, diligent
    job."

    who you know</cite>\r\n\r\nActually I'd almost have said the reverse. My first
    gig came thru a connection, I didn't have a portfolio at all (did not attend design
    school). I started out making stats and ended up designing books. My portfolio
    (and to some extent connections) got me my subsequent jobs. I got my dream job
    at 30 through a cold call. My letter and resume happened to land on the A.D.'s
    desk just after she learned someone was leaving. Then the A.D. left and I got
    her job ;-)\r\n\r\nIt NEVER hurts to network. Always have your business cards
    on you. But a design school portfolio is just that. Your portfolio won't be as
    much help until it has professional work in it (IMHO). I echo what Don said above,
    do what you can to get a foot in the door and don't expect too much at first.
    If you're good, you'll move up soon enough."

    go, you get different experiences and see what the workplace is actually like.\r\n\r\nThe
    hires at my work get accepted on 2 qualifications: portfolio and more important
    than that, personality. If I have to work closely with someone I need to be able
    to get along with them. Most portfolios I see are about the same - haven't been
