  it from an old receipt, and the letters u can se is: QJ*6123 MN 6,9 p/P\r\n\r\nI've
  \"restored\" the QJ*6 letters in photoshop, all the letters should look like that
  but the others is due to bad scanner/receipt...\r\n\r\nWhat i've found is that it
  almost looks like some kind of Gothic font.. but none of them is like the letter
  J.. Please help me!\r\n"

    body: "Yes I think so too. The theory that it's not a digital font for a computer...\r\nThe
      font you suggested is close but not perfect :D Im thinking of creating the font
      in Macromedia Fontographer. Maybe that the best solution?"

    of such a typeface. If your answer is 'YES\", and If you have the time and skill
    to reproduce a mechanical printer type, that is a fine way. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
