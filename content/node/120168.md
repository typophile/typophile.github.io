    offhand whether this precise one was made into a font\r\nEd Interlock from House
    is good http://www.houseind.com/fonts/edbenguiatfonts. As are the several Interlock
    fonts at Myfonts.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "Fivos, your idea makes sense. \r\nYou could use a fairly conventional font
    as a base and edit the outlines to approach the design. Since we have no further
    lettering in the exact style of the movie this could work.\r\nThis would definitely
    be an original artistic creation and could be quite interesting. Better than ripping
    off the existing interlock fonts.\r\nDon"
