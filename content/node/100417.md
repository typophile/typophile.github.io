  body: "That's just good old [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/|Helvetica
    Bold]], badly degraded by several generations of copying.\r\n<em>Kentucky Fried
    Movie</em> is hilarious, by the way--still one of my favorites."

  body: thanks, although I still doubt that, if you look at the roundness of the C
