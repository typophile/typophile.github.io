  body: "I guess you'll get better answer pointing directly to Alexia Roux's [[http://alexiaroux.fr/portfolio/memoire|portfolio]].
    You'll probably note she used to different sans, one is own Alexia Roux's custom
    typeface called 'Perception' (as seen [[http://alexiaroux.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/391.jpg|here]])
    and the one you're after which I wasn't able to positively identify.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    after further inspection the second one could be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans-2|Hurme
    Geometric No.2]]. At least I can't see any contradiction with it (/a, /0, /1,
    /2, /3, /5, /8, /G, /M, /L, /S...)."
