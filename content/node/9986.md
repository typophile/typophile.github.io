body: 'Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>This might sound like a very basic question, but there
  goes: <BR>I have designed a custom lettering for a logo project and I would like
  to present it in 2 more weights- light and medium &#40;the current one being bold
  as I see it&#41;. What is the easiest way to modify the exisiting outlines into
  lighter versions?'

  body: There is no &#34;easy way&#34; to do a decent job. I have tried the assorted
    methods in FontLab and Fontographer and find it is faster and better to just draw
    it in the new weight than to try to clean up the mess the &#34;easy way&#34; makes.

  body: Thanks Chris, <BR> <BR>This makes sense. Especially when you do not have to
    design the whole alphabet all over again. I also tried some tricks in Illustrator,
    but it did not look right.

  body: I think he means to do it by hand/eye, rather than by automated computer process.
    <BR> <BR>The automated process ends up creating problems you need to fix anyway,
    so you might as well do it on your own.

  body: Andre, <BR>Chris Rugen is right. I meant to draw it in the same way that he
    drew the heavier weight using it as a visual guide. He seems to have used Illustrator
    as a tool.  My only suggestion would be to put the original weight on a different
    layer and lock it so you can see it underneath.  Sometimes you turn the tracing
    layer off when it distracts you.

  body: a trick you could try... if you have illustrator <BR>create outline, select
    your letter and go to the menu select, path, offset path... in the offset enter
    a positive value for bold and a negative value for light. I think that could have
    good result and save a lot of time... <BR> <BR>Sorry about my english
