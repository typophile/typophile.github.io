  body: "Rob, have you done any searching for ornate initials? These are so specialized
    that I doubt many of us are too familiar with them, because we come across them
    rarely. It would be nice to know that you have made at least some sort of search.
    I also have to add, that I think the 'asap!' is a turn-off for many IDers. We
    pretty much try to answer all posts as quickly as we can, since there is at least
    some satisfaction in being first to get the answer, for many of us.\r\n\r\nYour
    letter may be custom, or it may just be no one is sure what your question was
    about. \"Ornate B Initial - any ideas?\" might have been a better title, and you
    can still edit it, since it was your post.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
