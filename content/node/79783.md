  body: "This seems like a very atypical serif italic, and certainly not like Garamond
    in my opinion.\r\nThe serifs are very small on the caps. The G has a rather high
    chin. It seems to be more like a display font, than a text font, to me.\r\n\r\nI
    keep thinking this is an old film type, but I haven't been able to locate it in
    my books.\r\n\r\nCan you tell us anything about the age and origin of this sample?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. I realize it was not totally Garamond,
    but the \"h\" was a hint of Garamond Ital like. I scanned these from a recent
    fashion magazine which I couldn't get the name of the publication.\r\n\r\nSal"
