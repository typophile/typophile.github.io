    first, looks more original and you can see perfectly the water drops.\r\n\r\n"

    you want to associate with a festival. Not sure if anyone else sees this, or what
    to do to fix it.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I like this a lot. The 2 images are front and back, right?\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Lex, the big outline drop does look noose like. I would loose it. It may
    be too big anyway, and it's the only place you switch to outline, which makes
    the water drop black and visually contradicts the ones on the crossbar.\r\n\r\nYou
    could just finish the F the same as on the back, and maybe have a small white
    drop hanging from it, like the ones on the crossbar.\r\n\r\nThe tops of the M
    could be a bit rounder, they seem a bit flat. And the cut off M on the back image
    is a bit harsh.\r\n\r\nThe Monsoon Festival sounds fun. Wish i could go."

  body: "Yeah wormwood..its fun...really fun...welcome anytime.\r\nUnfortunitely the
    designs has already gone for printing...and thus I can't make any changes now...I
    liked the design when i made but now I realize that it could be much better if
    I had posted them here before i sent it for printing...anyway...I'll make all
    these changes before i'll add this design to my portfolio....and from now, I'll
    will post first here before i send them for printing.\r\n\r\nThanks a ton for
    the feedback\r\n\r\nsatya\\\r\nGraphic Design Srudent\r\nNational Institute of
