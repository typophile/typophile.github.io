  is the most obvious way to do it, to get a typewriter and photograph the thing or
  do you know of a font with this kind of detail or what do you suggest?\r\n\r\nThanks
  fellars!"

    old typewriters. Wouldn't be practical for text, but if you just need to set a
    headline you could rearrange the letters in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nAlso I'll bet you
    could buy a used typewriter pretty cheap. Your public library might even have
    one still around that you could use.\r\n\r\n"

    Blur and Dissolve features in Photoshop.

  body: "More font options here:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/distressed+typewriter/fonts/\r\n\r\nHowever
    most of the typewriter fonts I've seen have a high-contrast look to them (like
    typewriter type that's been xeroxed), and don't have the subtle shading of the
    real example you posted. "

  body: If you need lots of detail you can always fake it by hand. Print the type
    out at a huge size, distress/tweak/etc with black pens and white paint, scan it
    in Photoshop, and hide the evidence. Then you can reduce and drop it on top of
    a texture as needed.

  body: "First step is to distort the letter's edge, and in this case keeping the
    distortion in the same 'style' as with the desired font manipulation. So I chose
    to use a brush of shaggy carpet. I used Arial Rounded and stoked it 3px(?) maybe
    2px - I forget. Rasterized the text and merged it with the Layer Style. Then I
    hit it with the Eraser brush of shaggy carpet.\r\n\r\nOnce I had the edge to where
    I like it (heavy handed and hurried as my sample is), I duped the layer several
    times (3) and Gaussian blurred the middle one, and merged all.\r\n\r\nThen I grabbed
    a standard Stipple brush and began to texture as shown. I used three grey tones
    and I think I used about three different course sizes going from less course to
    heavy course - background to foreground in my texture layers.\r\n\r\nOne interesting
    track mark in the Mr.X image is shown in the up-scaled edge image. A selection
    of the letter seemed to have been made and contacted (something like 2px or so),
    then inversed. This 'edge' was then darkened and nudged. And, the Stipplin' and
    the darkened edge seem to suggest a slight light source direction going on (?)...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontmanip_LOVEMR_5037.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    my hurried attempt is heavy handed sorry about that. A finer Stipple brush should
    have been used, and the darkened edge is also to thick, and I Gaussian blurred
    my type too much.\r\n\r\nI always crit myself - sick basterd that I am.\r\n\r\nOh
    ya I forgot to mention that there seems to be some Stipplin' going on out side
    of the type which also varies in coarseness.\r\n\r\nGood luck, hope that helps."
