  body: "Helvetica Light seems the most likely candidate, but why they would typeset
    it and post it as an image instead of using live text is beyond me.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/\r\n\r\nCSS
    would allow you to style it in a similar fashion, but maybe they wanted more control
    (they are architects, after all). What live type they use on their site is also
    Helvetica."
