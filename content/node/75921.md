  amazing latest viral/campaign called 'Kick-Ass'. It's for their sneakers, not as
  big as 'Be Stupid' but still, so good!\r\n\r\nI'm thinking they must be using a
  form of Bodoni as 2nd font (for the supers under the main titles- Great for kicking
  asses). And the first font on the title (DIESEL Sneakers. Not Made For Running)
  kind of reminded me Ziggurat in the first place but it is not. Pretty Sheriff though...\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know which are these 2 fonts used in the campaign? Below are some links of
  prints and videos. Thanks a lot in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs368.ash2/64656_10150294230165484_62659045483_15262006_2040495_n.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf7nCsZ0dDE"
