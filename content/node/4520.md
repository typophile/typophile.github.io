  body: MS probably avoided Linotype because they simply don&#39;t have the technical
    savvy for something of this caliber. They would have had to fragment and outsource
    it, and they&#39;d still be lacking somebody who could tie it all seamlessly into
    the OS. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I think it does, and I have had occasion to see a lot more Segoe than
    most other people outside of Microsoft and Agfa Monotype. I don&#39;t know whether
    Segoe is an intentional rip-off -- and to a large extent I think the question
    is irrelevant --: the similarity between the two faces is too great not to cause
    scandal, and MS should be concerned about this.'

  body: 'Since I first saw Segoe, I&#39;ve looked a lot at it, and at Frutiger and
    Myriad, and also at Stone Sans. The latter three constitute what I consider a
    sub-genre of humanist sans -- the Frutiger Line --, although Stone Sans also owes
    something to Meier&#39;s Syntax. It is a narrow sub-genre, clearly defined by
    Frutiger, but within it Myriad and Stone Sans manage to present novelty and originality:
    I don&#39;t consider Myriad a clone of Frutiger. Whatever the intent of the designer
    of Segoe, and whatever his design process/method, the simple fact is that there
    is neither novelty nor originality in the result: it just looks like Frutiger.

  body: 'Hrant, the whole point of ClearType is to reduce the need for extensive hinting
    in the x-direction. The ClearType renderer actually <i>ignores</i> x-direction
    delta hints. Ross and I have done extensive work with ClearType, and there is
    no gain in trying to control x-direction stems or proportions: the ClearType resolution
    gain allows greater fidelity to the glyph form, so optimal screen readability
    can be addressed in the design process rather than in the hinting. Indeed, if
    a font does contain x-direction stem hints -- e.g. for the benefit of 300 dpi
    laser printers -- it is often beneficial to turn them off for the CT renderer,
    which produces better results without them. <BR> <BR>Note that these comments,
    while generally true of ClearType in its currently shipping incarnation, are even
    more pertinent to recent improvements that will ship with future MS software.'

    <BR> <BR>Put Frutiger, Myriad and Stone Sans side by side and you will see relationships
    between them. Myriad is closer to Frutiger than Stone Sans, to be sure, but they
    do form a kind of sub-genre: there is a familial relationship. If Myriad is the
    direct descendant of Frutiger, Stone Sans is a kind of grandchild. In any case,
    my main point is that Myriad has both novelty and originality, whereas Segoe does
    not.'

    <BR>When MS first shipped a product with the CT renderer -- the first version
    of the MS Reader -- they went to great lengths to try to hint the Reader fonts
    -- ironically, including Frutiger Linotype -- so that stem edges would fall on
    the same subpixel boundaries, but this was because the first version of the renderer
    was not as good as it has since become. It is now possible to achieve excellent,
    consistent, high contrast bitmaps with greater fidelity to the outline width and
    weight. Again, this means that screen readability can be optimised in glyph design.

  body: 'I think this whole issue brings about new issues that need to be addressed,
    especially in the realm of copyright protection, which I know may be a point falling
    on deaf ears in the US.  &#40;I&#39;ve seen some really crazy stuff in my day,
    but the treatment of type design in the US is one of the most astounding slaps
    in the face I&#39;ve ever experienced--I know I&#39;m preaching to the choir.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I guess the biggest question I&#39;d pose on this matter is:  Does adding
    special treatment to an existing face &#40;in this case, hinting, or specifically,
    &#34;ClearTyping&#34; [which is a phrase that I believe WILL be necessary in the
    near future, if it isn&#39;t already--so I&#39;ll take full credit for coining
    it when a definitive dictionary of type design emerges]&#41; give it credibility
    as a new face?  It obviously doesn&#39;t, or it shouldn&#39;t anyway.  If that
    were the case then everyone would need to learn ClearTyping &#40;which, frankly,
    I&#39;m not prepared to do at this point&#41;; if you don&#39;t ClearType your
    face at the onset, &#34;someone&#34; else might do it in the future, which from
    what I can see in the comparison is what happened here. <BR> <BR>I agree that
    to make a more accurate judgement I&#39;d have to see some higher resolution;
    regardless, at this point I can see only a few minor differences...  and those
    appear to be the result of hinting variation.  Doesn&#39;t make it a different
    face, though.'

  body: 'John: your points about ClearType make sense to some extent, but I think

    it can&#39;t totally get rid of the need &#40;not at current screen resolutions
    - not everybody is using your settings :-&#41;. You say that ClearType ignores
    x-hints. Sure. But I can think of two reasons for that, both temporary: hinting
    at triple the resolution with the color filtering trickery thrown in is much harder,
    and they didn&#39;t want to hold up the other MS products waiting for a first
    iteration of CT; and they wanted to leave room for improvement&#42;, and could
    afford to since even a &#34;low-tech&#34; incarnation of subpixel rendering is
    still a big improvement. <BR> <BR>&#42; Leaving room for improvement has in fact
    become standard practice in the software industry, because you can charge for
    upgrades. <BR> <BR>Basically what I&#39;m getting at is that even with triple
    the resolution and anti-aliasing, there&#39;s some room left for improvement,

  body: I think there could be, in some instances, a very small gain in the contrast
    of some bowl shapes by hinting to specific subpixels; however, now that the colour
    filtering is doing such a good job there is a much karger benefit to be had in
    using subpixels for <i>spacing and kerning</i>, which so far has not been done.
    Once you start allowing the glyphs to fall on subpixel widths and to be kerned
    to subpixels, you lose the ability to predict on which subpixel boundary a stem
    will fall, but you gain a huge amount typographically.

  body: 'Well, Hrant, I can&#39;t argue with any of that, you&#39;re obviously right.  Part
    of the difficulty in this discussion depends on which aspect &#40;or, perhaps
    more accurately, which argument&#41; we&#39;re going after.  If we&#39;re talking
    about copyright protection then the points you brought up are major issues &#40;not
    that they aren&#39;t otherwise&#41;.  I would venture to say that type design
    is the most difficult copyright question to answer...  it may be obvious to you
    and I, but it&#39;s clear that more than a few political types don&#39;t see it
    our way.  Most of them can&#39;t see past the notion that we&#39;re not trying
    to claim the alphabet itself&#42;, but our own interpretations of it; with that
    in mind, can you imagine the smoke that&#39;d spout from their ears if they even
    heard the points we just discussed? <BR> <BR>Of course other factors play here,
    too.  What amount of work has to be performed on a &#40;pre&#41;existing object
    before that work itself is protected as a new object?  Perhaps a lessen can be
    taken from the field of translation:  Translations are only granted a &#34;derivational
    copyright&#34; because they are considered derivative works, and the translator
    must still gain permission from the original copyright owner to do anything to
    it.  &#40;This is all keeping in mind that, oftentimes, the translator will put
    in almost three times as much work as the original author.&#41; <BR> <BR>This
    and other issues need to be resolved before most policy-makers are ever going
    to take the matter seriously. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;I read an article a few years
    ago about a visual poet &#40;was it Richard Kostelanetz?&#41; who had given the
    copyright office so much trouble that he was actually assigned a personal copyright
    caseworker.  This poet&#39;s work consisted of a lot of typographical work &#40;the
    one I remember was three sizes of the lowercase a arranged on various parts of
    the page&#41;.  The caseworker argued that the copyright office wasn&#39;t going
    to offer protection to a pre-existing system, and that any modification of the
    forms involved was &#34;of a supernatural nature.&#34;  Whatever that means.'
