  read similar post but can remember any with the number \"100\". Made a search and
  did not found anything...\r\nI'm preparing a logo for a company  that makes 100
  years next year.\r\nSo I'm looking for a typeface for the \"100\".\r\nI want a \"classic
  look\", \"strong\" (bold?), \"straith\" not italic, sans or not...\r\nI made some
  test and these are is \"my results\"...\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/100_4156.jpg]"

    examples at a size where all of them look a little bit blunt, to me. There are
    display versions of Bodoni, Arno and Chaparral that would have some more character.\r\nF"

    big will it be displayed?\"\r\nWell...not shure yet, but not big. Only in catalogues
    and some ceramic pieces (gifts...etc).\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/100a_3657.jpg]"
