body: I was wondering if anyone has a trick to preview fonts quickly or knows some
  kind of software that does that?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m on PC, I currently use Adobe
  Type Manager but everytime I want to see a sample of a font, I have to click and
  it loads in a different window each time. I&#39;ve tried a few sharewares I found
  on cnet and they have a split screen where you see the sample next to your font
  list, you can also compare 2 fonts, etc. The problem is they can never can remember
  all the fonts on my HD. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?

    target="_blank">Version Tracker</a> and use the keywords <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/php/search.php?mode=basic&amp;action=search&amp;str=font%20preview&amp;plt%5B%5D=windows&amp;x=13&amp;y=8"

  body: Hey that&#39;s weird, I was always left with the impression that Suitcase
    and VersionTracker were both exclusive to MacIntosh. I tried a few of the shareware
    for &#34;font previee&#34; on <a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank">www.download.com</a>
    &#40;cnet&#41; but luckily the ones on versiontracker aren&#39;t the same. Hopefully
    I&#39;ll get better luck this time =&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks!
