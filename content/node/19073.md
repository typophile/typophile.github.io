    don't do Polytonic. Kinda wish one of the Greek native speakers would notice your
    post though.\r\n\r\nAre you going to Type Tech Weekend in NYC on the 22nd?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    I could ask around for you here in Cyprus. Are you looking for a translation into

    body: "Hi Nick - Here's the plan. First, someone will translate your paragraph
      into demotic Greek, then another person - a monk apparently at a big monastery
      in the mountains - will turn that into a polytonic version! When I'm sure this
      really can happen, shall I contact you via your website?\r\n\r\nLeads me to
      wonder what motivates font makers - yourself included? - to produce polytonic
      Greek type. Who uses it? As I understand it's pretty much limited to classicists,
      the Church - hence the monk - and I guess academics discussing older texts.
      Not complaining, mind, just interested.\r\n\r\nAre you in fact making a Greek
      font of your own?\r\n\r\nToby"

  body: "<em>Who uses it?</em>\r\n\r\nI was persuaded by several people.\r\nDavid
    Lemon at Adobe saying that classicists need it, and there are a lot of them around
    the world.\r\nGerry Leonidas at Reading saying that there are recent pre-monotonic
    texts (not just Homer etc.) that still are quoted and reprinted in Greece using
    polytonic, and a subculture of present day writers who use it -- much the same
    way many typographers still use old type designs like Helvetica, etc. \r\n\r\n<em>what
    motivates font makers</em>\r\n\r\nObsessive adolescent behaviour. \r\nAnd it's
    those damn folks at Adobe always raising the bar.\r\nProfessional challenge.\r\nAnd
    one gets bored with the same old glyphs, so curiosity, bring on the Greek and
    Cyrillic.\r\nAlso, I took Greek at school, so it's familiar (although I've forgotten
    too much to be able to do the translation).\r\n\r\n<em>Are you in fact making
    a Greek font of your own?</em>\r\n\r\nOf course, and I'm not alone. Typophiler
    Chris Lozos (Dezcom) has one, a family actually, in the works too."

  body: Toby, there are literary publishers in Greece who never stopped using polytonic.
    As Nick notes, there is also a lot of polytonic text floating around out there
    that needs to be typeset, and not only classical or religious text. I recently
    found out that one of my polytonic Greek types might be used for a new edition
    of the poems of Cavafy, which is a thrill for me because he is one of my favourite
    modern poets.
