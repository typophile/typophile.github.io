body: "Can anyone point me in the right direction of how to embed fonts in Flash CS3,
  while using Actionscript 3.0 and CSS to manipulate formatting of the text in a given
  dynamic field?\r\n\r\nI sort of achieved what I was looking for using AS2 but I
  also didn't embed the fonts that the CSS styles are made up of. I can't even imagine
  how the CSS will be able to tell Flash what embedded typeface to use (via \"font-family\"?).
  Does this even make sense?\r\n\r\nShould I upload an example?\r\nI'm interested
  in having two or more typefaces that are embedded, show up on a single line together,
  oppose to separate text fields.\r\n\r\n(I wish typography was easier in Flash...)\r\n\r\n=[\r\n\r\nanything
  helps | thnx guys! =)"

    ("MyFont"). Once the font are embedded you can call them dynamically using HTML
    in your text field. '
