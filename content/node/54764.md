  I've read a few books/articles about setting up a grid for standard size pages but
  very little has been mentioned about square grids?\r\n\r\nAny direction of help
  is appreciated. Examples would be great help.\r\n\r\nI am new here and I am Scott.
  Thanks."

    It really only becomes a problem if it\u2019s a book someone will be holding to
    read, in which case I\u2019ll set up a line where running copy stops but still
    use the full page for other stuff. Take a look at Willi Kunz\u2019s books to see
    great use of a square page with a grid."
