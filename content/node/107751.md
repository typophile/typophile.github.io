  body: "This retro packaging recreates the 1960s wordmark.\r\nThe treatment of the
    lettering is very late 1950s when \"tipsy\" or \"bouncy\" serifs were the height
    of fashion. The use of color letter blocks  was often used by TV shows and stations
    in the 1960s to highlight color-television technology.\r\nHere's a few fonts from
    Filmotype in the tipsy/bouncy style of the era:\r\nOrlando:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/orlando/\r\nPanama:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/panama/\r\nParade:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/parade/\r\nThere
    may be a font with a free form serif that is close to Doritos. Worth checking
    to see if an amateur has created a font to mimic the letters in this retro package.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Sorry but no solution out-of-the-box... Closest I've found are [[http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Periwinkle-JBT0000088|Periwinkle
    Fancy]] and [[http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Fanfare-JBT0000066|Fanfare]] which
    look too 'funky' to be considered as good substitutes...\r\n2 ways to do the job:\r\n-
    find the best sample you can and retrace it (automatically using an auto-trace
    tool?)\r\n- customize an existing font: even if it's sounds weird, I'd probably
    start with Times New Roman or any of its digitizations by different foundries:
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/dutch-801/extra-bold-italic|Dutch 801]]
    (Bitstream version of Times), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman/d-extra-bold-italic|Nimbus
    Roman]] (URW version), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/thames-serial/heavy-italic|Thames]]
    (Softmaker version); More candidates for a customization: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/etienne|Etienne]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-880|Modern 880]] Bold and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/moderno|Moderno]]\r\n\r\nFind
    [[http://ge.tt/6sOGWbA1/v/0|here]] a PDF with from top to bottom:\r\n- your sample
    reworked as black and white logo\r\n- a quick auto-trace (vector) using Ai internal
    tracing tool\r\n- a basic skeleton based on Times New Roman Bold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5511.png]"

  body: "Nice work Ryuk. Times Roman is close enough for an adaptation of the base
    outlines.\r\nTo get a bouncing effect for a full alphabet a good trick is to do
    a font with only the lower case letters, using the upper case positions for a
    raised lower case, and the lower case positions for a descended lower case. The
    capital letters can be placed in a second font, with the same raised and descended
    treatment. Using the two fonts together means that the user can create the bouncing
    effect for any words with the raised and descended letters alternating one after
    the other.\r\nDon"

    for a client a while back. I was making a retro type theme and chose [[http://www.dafont.com/fontdinerdotcom-lou.font|Fontdinerdotcom
    Loungy]]. I had to make changes to the individual letters to get the size and
    height I wanted, then I put each letter in a colored block and staggered them
    myself. Below is a screenshot of the finished work...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img36/7876/nbbm.png\">"
