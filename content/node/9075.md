  body: Try English Script from Bitsream. Wow! it is aweful close. BUT, not quite.
    The amperstand! and also mini ball terminals on the cap W. How old is this company?

    <BR> <BR>Randy <BR> <BR>BTW I also looked at a print from the Cronite Companies
    Master Plate fonts, and their english script has much reduced ball terminals.
    Doesn&#39;t help the amperstand.

  body: 'Definately even closer, though it doesn&#39;t show the amperstand in my sample:
    Middleton&#39;s Formal Script, Ludlow 1956. Can&#39;t find it digitaly. WB&amp;C
    was founded in 1935. So it&#39;d have to be an update on the original logo. <BR>
    <BR>Anyone? I&#39;ll upload a scan if I get a chance. <BR>R'

  body: Randy <BR> <BR>I tried English Script. As you said, so close but the amperstand.
    There are so many fonts &#34;close to&#34; but I can&#39;t seem to find the exact
    match. Thanks for trying. I&#39;m still hunting. Will let you know if I find it.

    the origin of the logo, Jill. <BR>If it&#39;s an older design that may explain

    bet you  <BR>won&#39;t find an ampersand exactly like that one. My  <BR>guess
    is that it was altered so the trailing stroke didn&#39;t  <BR>hit the &#34;Company&#34;.'

  body: I like the English Sackers Script. Thats about the closest I&#39;ve seen along
    with Copperplate Script. I also agree with you that the ampersand was probally
    altered. I&#39;m going to talk with my customer tomorrow to see if I can find
    out anything regarding the original font. <BR> <BR>Thanks Stephen. <BR>Jill

    <BR>Ok, the customer did not want to purchase fonts so I had to work with what
    I have. She said to get as close as possible. I used Shelley Andante Script for
    the &#34;W&#34; in William and the &#34;r&#34; in Blair. I then used Palace Script
    for the rest of the text and altered the ampersand to look as close to the original.
    This is how it turned out.

  body: I don&#39;t know why the ampersand is looking bolder than the rest?? It doesn&#39;t
    look like that in illustrator or when I print it out.

  body: It could be because you altered the ampersand, which means you have converted
    it to an outline, while the rest are not. <BR> <BR>Try converting all the fonts
    to outlines, if you want a more consistent look and see if it works. <BR> <BR>Otherwise
    you might need to alter the thickness manually.&#40;?&#41; <BR> <BR>Just a suggestion.

  body: Karen, <BR>Thats exactly what I did. The ampersand was converted to an outline
    so I could manipulate it. But like I said, it only shows bolder in my jpeg and
    the factory wants vector art and it looks good in illustrator so I guess i&#39;m
    ok. <BR> <BR>Jill
