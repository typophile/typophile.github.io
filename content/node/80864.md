  been really inspired by propaganda posters, especially the one I've attached. I
  know these were probably never really typefaces as we know them today but I'm wondering
  if there's anything else out there that might somewhat approximate them.\r\n\r\nI'm
  especially wondering about the italic and the more square sans, the more rounded
  sans could probably be achieved with Futura."
