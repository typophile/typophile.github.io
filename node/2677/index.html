I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s up with the thickness not seeming even, as every vertical line is a consistent mathematical width.  If you could tell me which characters seem inconsistent with others, that might help if there is an optical distortion that I don&#39;t see because I&#39;m so close.  I&#39;m taking a look at the P,B,G,and W.  Thanks. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23915.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think what Chris means about the thickness is some of your diagonals: like the M, that is way off from the rest. It isn&#39;t really up to mathmatical precision of your stems, it is also things like the terminals and horiz/vert joins and the spaces around and within the glyphs. The size of the  &#39;e&#39;,  for example, iseems larger and lighter than the &#39;d&#39;. The hairlines in &#39;v&#39; seem thinner than those of the &#39;y&#39;. This is a good, fairly complete start! I reckon the next step is to make the glyphs a little more consistent. <BR> <BR>kris.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">God help me, but this is just a small sample of they glyphs in this face.  I have about a thousand glyphs, including 50 ligatures so far, nearly complete Greek and Cyrillic glyphsets, IPA characters, and extended Latin characters.  The reason I put the simple Roman out is that I can use that information throughout the face.  The mistakes I&#39;ve made here are ones I have probably made everywhere, and I&#39;ve already started using these critiques throughout.</div>

The &#34;plunge&#34; seems to have been a while ago, actually... <BR> <BR>Well, the good news is that such obsessive behavior is a requirement for type design.  :-&#41; <BR>The bad news is that -as far as I&#39;m concerned- just what you&#39;ve shown really needs a <i>lot</i> of polish... <BR> <BR>Unless the intent -or at least an acceptable result- is to have a rough, &#34;naive&#34; looking font, there are issues of both structure and finish that need to be commanded before you worry about the <i>quantity</i> of glyphs. I don&#39;t want to be discouraging - in fact I think your heart is in the right place! But before you do any more bezier-pushing maybe it&#39;s a good time to look closely at existing &#40;good&#41; designs first? Develop a grasp of how things balance. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Does it lack historical cohesiveness?  Is it more a matter of color and feel?

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Van. <BR> <BR>Welcome to typophile. This is a great first effort! <BR> <BR><i>That said, what are the issues of structure and finish that you see being detrimental to the face as it currently stands?</i> <BR>Being a first effort, you&#39;ve turned up many of the classic first time problems. Many of the issues turn up as a result of the constructed nature of your font &#40;ie. you&#39;ve borrowed the o to make the c, you&#39;ve borrowed the c to make the n, youve borrowed the n to make the h, and I don&#39;t know why she swollowed the fly.&#41; This is a very common way of doing things &#40;even among accomplished designers&#41;. With time you will learn how the constructed letters need to be &#42;fixed&#42; to look correct. Aside from that, consider first the following font-wide problem: <BR> <BR><i>Stoke Modulation:</i> This is the location and flow of the thicks and thins of your font. Kudos to you, the locations of thick and thin look pretty good, it&#39;s the consistent application of thick and thin that is a big issue here </div>
