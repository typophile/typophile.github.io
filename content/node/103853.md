  body: Thanks for the responses. Compacta seems spot on except for the capital E.
    I'll give the other typefaces a try and see what I come up with.

  body: i don't really agree on the Compacta diagnosis, but can't find an exact match
    as yet either. the gap in the A is off in addition to the E and I can't feel too
    happy about the proportion of the M legs.

  body: "Brings us back to the issue of whether the letters are direct from a font
    or are redesigned. \r\nIf the letters are an unmodified sample of a common digital
    font I would have expected that one of us would have run across something closer
    than Compacta by now. \r\nEasy to modify Compacta per defiantone's observations,
    but that still begs the question of whether a 100% match exists.\r\nDon"
