body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI need some information/sources on modular typefaces today.
  I have enough material on historical modular type. I mean reasons for creating and
  using one.\r\nNow there is a real problem with understanding modular type in today's
  context. What we can see now is the use of module based system as a stylization.
  These typefaces neither utilizing some kind of idea/movement nor using modularity
  for economical reasons ( comparing to 20s and 30s typefaces). \r\nActually I think
  every digital font is somehow modular. Module is pixel. LCD screens also utilize
  module based type. \r\nHowever different variations of modular typefaces are still
  created ( even easier now with \u201Dfont struct\u201C).\r\nWhat do you think of
  modular type in today's context? How can it be used to reflect new technology or
  new thoughts/ philosophies/movements?"

    than economy. When I make a modular font, I'm using basic shapes to make a distingt
    design, rather than making my work easier. In most cases modular design in fact
    makes it harder to build a full font, with so many different forms I have to compliment
    with just one module.\r\n\r\nA pixel is rather too small to be considered a module
    to me. But in a sense you are right: Type 1 glyphs are drawn into a 1000 x 1000
    grid, so if you want stretch the idea that far, all typefaces are modular."

  body: "Wow...it's getting philosophical. Thank you all for your answers! Actually
    I think I need to ask the right question to get answers I need. The main thing
    I want to understand \u2014 is there any need for modular type now or it's just
    a puzzle for type designers. Why do we still get all those \"everything is made
    of one triangle\" typefaces? Font Struct is a somehow trendy thing today. Thus
    we have a modular font trend at some point. Why can it be? I don't think something
    has changed in last two or three years in cultural/ social context and design
    practice.   "

  body: '@riccard0, I believe you are right in so far as learning to read is in part
    learning to recognize the "modules" permitted in a writing system, and the way
    these modules are combined to form specific letters. But then we are IMO dealing
    with "scriptology", not typography. A typographer would want to adjust the shape
    of each letter to ease legibility, even out the colour, etc. This normally requires
    adjustments on a smaller scale than replacing one module with another.'

  body: "My two cent, as non type designer:\r\n- Type design has become more \"democratic\"
    lately, in the sense that more people have access to the tools, so it's easier
    that someone will try to make a font, either for fun or for the need of some graphic
    project. All these new, untrained, and inexperienced \"type designers\" will reinvent
    the wheel all over again every time, thus repeating experiments already done and
    working with modules both because it's (apparently) easier and because, in general,
    design loves constraints.\r\n- There's a growing need for extensive glyph coverage.
    Either in the form of Extended Latin or other scripts altogether. Here too using
    modules will speed up work (and possibly hinder quality)."

  body: '@foxyripper, I think a big reason for FontStruct''s popularity is that it
    is a very quick way of creating new fonts. Much quicker than drawing each letter
    by hand, giving thought to contrast, proportion and interplay of every line. I
    really can''t think of any other tool historically that compares with the ease
    and power of FontStruct -- it would probably have been popular in any time period.
    But FontStruct also has big limitations. Not only concerning design, but also
    with regard to metrics and kerning. As FontStruct itself is keen on reminding
    us, "Some fonts you just can''t FontStruct".'

    comes down to terminology. I get the impression what foxyripper is referring to
    is letters made up of pre-fabricated components. Of course, many a type designer
    might start designing a 'p' with a copy of the shape for 'o'. But again, 'o' is
    here a module only in the \"scriptological\" sense."

    Mecano]] was a tool for making variety of styles by combing modules in different
    ways (again economy and univeralisation \u2014 quite topical for 20s and 30s)\r\n\r\nWhen
    type designer decides to make a modular type, what ideas can he utilize now? I
    mean 80s gave as pixelated digital typefaces because of computer mania. Do we
    have something like that now. Something giving designers the idea of making modular
    type."

    problems, I should admit that mostly they are problems I've created, such as \"What
    would a slab serif designed by Bodoni look like?\" Most type designs could be
    described like that, e.g. \"What would my version of a squarish sans serif look

    A modular typeface is a classic challenge in the field."
