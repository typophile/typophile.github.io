  body: The bottom two lines are Times or Times New Roman &#40;hard to say for sure
    which&#41;. The &#34;cec&#34; is some form of Bodoni Bold, but it doesn&#39;t
    match any off-the-shelf version I know of. It&#39;s very Bodoni-like, but the
    crossbar on the &#34;e&#34; is lower than usual. Could be custom or an old film
    font.
