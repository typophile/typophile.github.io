  but upgraded to XP Pro recently and now that software does not work. I see work-arounds
  on the web for getting it to work in XP, but maybe it's time to upgrade.\r\n\r\nI
  don't have the circa-$1,000 for a new copy, does anyone know where I can get a legal
  copy at a VERY good price?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\nbimjim"

    upgading to FontLab from Fontographer is only $299 with valid serial:\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/\r\n<em>FontLab
    Studio 5 for Windows Upgrade from FontLab 4.0, 3.x and Fontographer US $299.00
    \ Please enter your valid FontLab or FOG serial number in the Other Notes field
    of the order form.</em>\r\n\r\nYou can try both as a demo. I'm not sure where
    your $1000 number is coming from, but direct from the company is thriftier by
    far.\r\n\r\nRandy"

    try picking a copy up cheap on eBay and use the serial from that.

  body: "Each Fontographer serial number is only eligible to one upgrade to FontLab
    Studio 5, and we keep track of serial numbers (for all our applications) that
    are being posted in illegal download sources. \r\n\r\nI believe that Fontographer
    4.1 (the old Macromedia product, which is still the latest version on Windows)
    actually displays the serial number in the About box, while Fontographer 4.7 (the
    relase that we prepared for Mac OS X) and our other products diplay the product
    number there, which is not the serial number. This is because it is in the users'
    best interest to keep their serial number private -- so that others cannot spot
    it, write it down and then use it to upgrade or serialize an illegal copy of their
    own. \r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
