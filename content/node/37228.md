  The font is MS - comes with the system. I tried to copy and past the type to illustrator
  and use the same font, but I can't get Japanese to show up. Just weird English punctuation.
  I know it must not be hard, but I haven't dealt with this before. In the mean time
  I've exported the doc to a pdf and opened in photoshop and saved as a tif file.
  Would like to be able to outline the font.\r\n\r\nThank you"
