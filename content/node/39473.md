body: "jumping off from the discussion on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39470\">How
  Many Ligatures?</a>, i have my own question. are precomposed ligatures preferable
  to using contextual glyphs that can combine with other letters the way that a ligature
  would? for example: would it be better to have an f_f ligature, or a contextual
  first f that would change to a linking version when followed by another f. we already
  do this for cursive styles, why not for roman?\r\none positive i can see from this
  scheme is that you can keep the glyph count down if you have a lot of character
  combinations that need to be solved with contextual forms, especially if these involve
  characters that may have diacritical forms. one drawback is that throwing diacritical
  forms into the mix might actually necessitate precomposed ligatures, thus duplicating
  work in some situations. anyone else have thoughts on this?"

    able to do multiple glyph subs in a single lookup would be the ideal. The alternative
    is a bit of a scripting mind bender, especially if you are wanting to sub more
    than 2 glyphs at a go.\r\n\r\nI remember Thomas Phinney promised this feature
    a few years ago at a TypeCon. Just kidding - he didn't. But seriously, Adobe -
    do it.\r\n\r\n- David"

  body: i don't think you would really need many to many lookups, but some simple
    chaining contextual substitutions would do the trick. this might become a bit
    more complex with diacritics, especially if you are using a 'mark' feature, but
    i think this should be doable easily enough?

    necessary for news faces, where some \"pagination\" (layout) applications often
    don't support even fi and fl ligatures."

  body: "I find myself using a combination of approaches, but philosophically at least
    I favour the contextual glyph option over ligatures. I think ligatures are essentially
    an artifact of metal type, and probably not veru helpful moving forward. There
    are exceptions, of course: where ligation of two or more characters results in
    a completely new, merged shape, as sometimes happens in traditional Greek or Devanagari
    ligation, then ligature glyphs are necessary. But if the component characters
    are essentially maintaining their independent identity and only linking together
    in some way, then I think contextual substitution makes so much more sense. It
    took a few years of dealing with Arabic to confirm this view, and I think it is
    only because the typical Latin ligature set is so small that it has not been more
    of an issue.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Jelle Bosma used the contextual alternate approach
    in Cambria, but associated the lookups with the 'liga' lookup, rather than with
    'calt'. I queried this at the time, but in retrospect I think it was the right
    choice."

  body: "thanks John. my current thinking follows yours, i would say. i'm leaning
    toward the opinion that contextual forms should be used wherever they can be and
    that true \"ligatures\" (perhaps more properly \"logotypes\"?) should be a last
    resort in instances, as you specify, the merged shapes morph so much as to make
    a simple contextual alternate form more difficult to work with than than it's
    worth.\r\n\r\ninteresting the insight on Bosma's work. i'll have to think on that
    a bit more. thanks again for sharing your experience."

  body: PS. re. Devanagari and some other Indic scripts. There is a secondary usefulness
    for ligature glyphs in Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati, etc., which is as triggers
    for width variants of the prepostional short ikar (vowel sign), which in traditional
    writing reaches over the full width of a ligated conjunct.
