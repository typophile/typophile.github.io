body: does anyone on the boards here in the chicago area ever meet up or have a little
  corner pub where they go to hang out, grab a drink and discuss typographic matters?
  is anyone currently collaborating on any projects in the chicago area or are planning
  to in the near future? by collaborative projects i&#39;m thinking currently active
  workshops, collaborative typeface design etc...would love to hear about the status
  of any such things... <BR> <BR>best <BR>w

  body: that&#39;s really great! used to do something similar to that with a couple
    buddies from back at school...get together on a tuesday night down the street,
    have drinks and discuss whatever was on our mind...usually design and usually
    Bush. most everyone got too busy with jobs, life etc unfortunately. i&#39;m just
    hoping there&#39;s some great workshops or collaboration going on because a little
    smack of creativity right now would be great. guess i&#39;ll just keep looking
    around with at least one open eye. thanks for the reply, dan <BR> <BR>best <BR>w

  body: Maybe you could email Armit Vit from Speak Up. Even if he isn&#39;t a part
    of something in Chicago, he would probably know about it. He seems to be the don
    of young graphic designers there. <BR> <BR>In 2000 the AIGA chapter was at least
    semi-active

  body: dan, currently i&#39;m a working designer with an actual title of marketing
    designer at modern luxury publishing co. they do CS magazine here in chicago and
    a whole host of others in the Cali and in Texas with new titles launching. it&#39;s
    expanding like crazy and that equals fun because it&#39;s lots of random work
    as they don&#39;t have the total staff they need so it&#39;s always a variety
    of design and layout. <BR> <BR>before that i was a practicing freelancer in the
    chicago area...i was doing the usual stationary stuff but really had fun doing
    music venue posters. did that for about 2 years and am still doing it on the side
    when time permits. it&#39;s a great way to stay creative as most of my clients
    trusted my judgement over time. <BR> <BR>before THAT i was at school at ringling
    school of art and design in sarasota florida on the gulf coast &#40;i think the
    gulf coast still exists?&#41; their i was immersed in complete experimentation
    in anything i could get my hands on. mostly type, as my typographic teacher 4th
    year was edwin utermohlen who studied under ed fella. the guy was pure inspiration
    and fun as hell to grab a beer with from time to time.  <BR> <BR>so in just about
    everything i do, it&#39;s my type i pay most attention to. for the most part when
    a logo project were to come up i&#39;d work a hand drawn  face up the would accompany
    a logo or mark...i just hated copping out and using something on the computer
    that sorta fit but didnt alot of the time. it just felt too easy and since i drew
    the mark in the first place it only made sense. since detail was of the essence,
    i just got really good over 2 years of doing detailed type sketches which lead
    to my ambitions of making typefaces...but it stems further back but i&#39;m out
    of breath here... <BR> <BR>best- <BR>will

  body: I&#39;m in Chicago. I don&#39;t have a regular bar where I meet typographers
    -- but I&#39;ve got a few regular bars. ;-&#41; Ada&#39;s on Wabash when I&#39;m
    downtown working; the Gold Star on Division when I&#39;m on my way home and feel
    like pretending I&#39;m hip. I&#39;d be happy to meet a Typophile at either one.
    Or at any bar for that matter. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re out and about tonight, I&#39;ll
    be at the Skylark &#40;Halsted &amp; Cermak&#41; with some folks I teach with,
    getting our new boss hosed. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been to a couple Future History
    conferences and they&#39;ve been really good. I&#39;m hoping to go this year,
    money permitting, since I&#39;ve got some interest in the non-Latin stuff. <BR>
    <BR>And to any SOTA organizers who may be reading, I&#39;m more than eager to
    help out if TypeCon makes it&#39;s way into the wasteland of northern Illinois.
    <BR> <BR>But now I have to pretend I&#39;m getting some work done....

    TypeCon. Will be cool to head back to the Midwest after the great reception we
    had in Minneapolis. <BR> <BR>Tijuana or another Latin American destination would
    be amazing. I would personally love to get TypeCon south of the border before
    the decade is over.
