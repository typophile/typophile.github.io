  to and including Akzidenz.  Yes I know technically the first sans' sprung up in
  the British Isles, but really it was in Germany where the idea started to take root.
  \ All I've been able to find out is that somehow it morphed out of the black-letter/fraktur
  model.\r\n\r\nThe mid to late 1800's was an incredibly fertile time for typeface
  development.  It's a shame there is not more widely available info about it out
  there.\r\n\r\nAnd what's with that term 'jobbing font,' anyway?  Does the word 'job'
  have a different meaning in Germany?  If a sign painter made an advertising sign
  in slab serif or 'brush script,' would he still not be completing a 'job' for someone?"

    That does odd jobs; employed by the job; employed in odd or occasional pieces

    better Italics than us. A must-read BTW is Ovink's \"Nineteenth-century reactions
    against the didone type model\" in Qu\xE6rendo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that looks interesting</a>. It is in Russian but translating with Google may give
    you useful hints.

  body: "Akzidenz is similar to the concept of \u2018jobbing\u2019, eg anything that
    comes along in the daily practice of a commercial printer. Look into the jargon
    of printing and you will be educated\u2026\r\n\r\n(Example: in Dutch that short
    line on a new page is called a \u2018hoerenjong\u2019 \u2014 whore\u2019s kid.
