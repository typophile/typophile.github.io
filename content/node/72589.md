    is obvious to me should be obvious to anyone, it still bears saying that it is
    <em>really, really obvious</em> that the sign painter improvised this by hand.
    To me.\r\n\r\nThe rounded \"movies!\" apparently added later is probably based
    on a typeface, but I wouldn't expend much effort trying to identify it without
    a clear indication that it's the focus of the inquiry."

  body: "It is quite a nice example of sign painting. The argument that technically
    any shape <em>could</em> be a typeface isn't very convincing here because you
    can see in the giant picture how heavily the painter relied on the bricks for
    construction guides.\r\n\r\nI should have said \"much <em>more</em> effort\" because
    I was curious enough to do some looking but I didn't find a match. It's not VAG
    Rounded because it has some thick-and-thin especially in the diagonals. It looks
    a lot like a rounded version of Franklin Gothic (with an upside-down W for the
    M), but if such a font exists I don't know where to find it."

    extensive set of widths, such as Berlow\u2019s Rhode (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/rhode/)
    could be used to recreate the overall feeling of the piece."
