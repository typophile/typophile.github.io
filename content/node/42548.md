  had any luck so far so maybe someone here can help.  I got this as part of my logo
  design for my business cards from a company that no longer exists so I can't contact
  them. Now I want to update part of the card but want the fonts to match. The phone
  number belongs to the senior partner that he no longer wants used or published and
  is one of the things I want to change so I blacked out duplicate numbers.  I included
  the numbers just to maybe increase the odds of this getting identified.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help you can give me.\r\nJacob\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/entertainment01_3924.GIF]"
