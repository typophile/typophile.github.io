  within the scope of InDesign and PDF.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_3793.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
  talking about the small black line down the middle of each spread, and sometimes
  (I don't know why) outlining the entire page. Sure, I can cover them up with white
  lines in the master pages, but is there some way of keeping them from ever exporting?\r\n\r\nI'm
  using CS4. Crop marks are turned on; PDF export follows the document's 0.125-inch
  bleed settings. I'm exporting to Acrobat 5 by default.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "David, I think someone drew some rules on a master page so that on printouts
    it would be clear where the trim would be. The reason the rules appear only on
    certain pages is that the document uses several different master pages, and only
    some of them contain those rules.\r\n\r\nFind the master page(s) that contains
    those rules and just delete the rules. (The Pages panel will tell which master
    is applied to which pages.) \r\n\r\nOR, if you want to keep those rules but just
    don't want them to appear in PDFs, use the Layers panel to create a new layer,
    move those rules to that layer, and turn off that layer before making a PDF. \r\n\r\nJames"

    were present in the master pages.
