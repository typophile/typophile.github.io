body: If I apply a certain amount of tracking to, say, a paragraph of text, InDesign
  will turn off ligatures and contextual alternates (actually not in the OpenType
  menu within the character window but the way it type sets text in a document). A
  situation I'm  not really happy with since I'm providing my typeface with these
  features not for nothing. Fortunately the ligatures and contextual alternates will
  remain when doing this in Illustrator. Does anyone know how this happen, or preferably,
  how to get rid of this happening?

    to within the font file itself? Like another OpenType feature which ignores/overrides
    InDesign's features.

    liga but also calt. Think of a non-connecting pseudo-random font whose randomization
    is switched off as soon as the designer increases the tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;:(\r\nUnfortunately
    I cannot think of a(n automatic) way to work around this behavior -- nor do I
    think that font developers should address applications' peculiarities.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    bomb Adobe with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform\"

  body: "I agree that an application preference or some way of turning this off would
    be nice.\r\n\r\nI think the basic idea of breaking the ligature when the tracking
    gets too extreme is a reasonable one. I personally confirmed both the general
    idea and the specific values InDesign uses back before the behavior was introduced.
    I agreed with the engineer proposing the change that past a certain amount of
    tracking, having a ligature results in such deviant spacing that things tend to
    look better without the ligature.\r\n\r\nApplying the same logic to 'calt' was
    a more unfortunate call. At the time, years ago, we believed that 'calt' would
    get used for what the feature specs originally suggested, making connecting alternate
    forms. Implicit in that, we thought, was the idea that the default forms would
    not be connecting. So overriding the connecting behavior in a connecting script
    when it got too heavily tracked \"seemed like a good idea at the time.\" In retrospect,
    not so much, I must say.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Tom, if you cast you mind back to the first thread we had about web font
    embedding you may recall yourself questioning why several of us on that thread
    were grumbling about Adobe softrware given the great boon of the OpenType format.\r\n\r\nMy
    response was along the lines of, \"I am grateful to Adobe for giving us a font
    format that allows me to realize dream projects.\"\r\n\r\nI stand by that response.
    At the time I neglected to make a clear distinction between Adobe application
    software and the OpenType format. These are two quite different animals. It is
    Adobe application programs that disappoint me, not the OpenType format itself.\r\n\r\nThis
    thread provides one more example of the infuriating engineering standard of Adobe
    application programs. For me it includes other stuff such as the messed-up ergonomics
    and interface design of Adobe apps, their sheer stupidity at not being able to
    keep track of folder locations I use repeatedly, resource hogging, and generally
    unintuitive software design. Photoshop for example annoys me so much I only use
    it when no alternative app will suffice.\r\n\r\nIt's worth saying that Microsoft
    application programs are barely any better engineered than Adobe's.\r\n\r\nI don't
    mean to hijack this thread. Just sayin', as a follow up.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "My post of yesterday night was a bit grumpy. I should clarify:\r\nThe idea
    that ligature substitution is switched off with increased tracking is a nice one.
    But it should be the font which defines up to which amount of tracking ligatures
    be applied. It depends on the design, e.g. the extend at which the f reaches out
    to the right. The amount could be a lookup-related flag.\r\nGiven fonts like Caflisch
    Script I can understand that switching off calt too was not regarded as problematic
    -- a connected script shouldn't be tracked anyway. The flaw is in the implicit
    assumption that calt is used in connected scripts only, rather than considering
    connected fonts as a subset of fonts that may use calt.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)"

  body: "Adobe's reasoning as expressed by Thomas sounds good. I wonder it the ligature
    breaking happens only when the ligature was formed by 'liga', as opposed to directly
    entered -- either by entering the Unicode value when one is assigned to ligatures,
    or directly selected from the glyph pallet?\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons to
    have this kind of layout engine behavior. Traditionally, ligatures weren't used
    above a certain size. I never much agreed with that one, but of course, in metal
    they also weren't generally available above a certain size.\r\n\r\nIf such a notion
    could be implemented (unbreaking only when created by 'liga'), it might cover
    the situation. Automatic ligaturing is only an aid to the compositor -- we used
    to have to spot them & set them ourselves. "

  body: "It may be helpful to know how the InDesign algorithm for turning ligature
    features on and off relative to tracking works. I asked Eric Menninga about this
    at TypeCon this year, because it has implications for how to design ligating alternates
    (contextual variant letters that form on-the-fly \u2018ligatures\u2019, activated
    by ligature features).\r\n\r\nThe amount of positive or negative tracking triggering
    disabling of the ligature features is relative to the width of the /space/ glyph
    in the font. An increase of more than 8% of the width of the /space/ glyph turns
    off the ligatures, as does a decrease of more than 22% of the width of the /space/
    glyph. That is to say, for a font with a /space/ glyph 200/1000 em units wide,
    the ligature features will turn off beyond +16 units tracking and -44 units tracking."
