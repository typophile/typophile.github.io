  Einaudi. Of course, it is a custom typeface, not available to the public. But I
  really love it!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.einaudi.it/var/einaudi/contenuto/extra/978880621249PCA.pdf\r\n\r\nCan
  you suggest a commercial typeface similar to this jewel? At the moment the only
  alternative I know is Simoncini Garamond.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nM."

    to be by Claude Garamont until the 1920s. Which is strange because they're quite
    different.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Even if I narrow my search to \"Jannons\", the only similar typeface is Simoncini
    Garamond... Unfortunately SG is a typeface a bit neglected by Adobe/Linotype:
    no pro, only three weights, limited kerning...\r\n\r\nIn fact the usage of Simoncini
    Garamond (and its many custom versions) as text font is really widespread among
    Italian book publishers. In Italy it is probably the most successful typeface
    of the twentieth century, but the only beautiful digital version is, in my opinion,
    the custom typeface currently used by Einaudi.\r\n"

  body: "Manosk, since you can't license Einaudi Garamond, I guess the best commercial
    version you can have today is the one by Elsner and Flake (named \"Garamond Simoncini
    EF\"), which features the old style numerals - but only in the roman weight, not
    finely spaced and not even OT-supported - and some of the inktraps which were
    so typical in the original metal version, and which are slightly noticeable in
    the quick screenshot comparison I made (top: Adobe, bottom: EF):\r\n\r\nhttps://farm6.staticflickr.com/5565/14714849382_f61a377cb4_o.jpg\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, what is curious is that the rights to the original typeface designed
    for Einaudi in 1961 by Francesco Simoncini and Wilhelm Bilz from Ludwig & Mayer
    (known as \"Garamond Antiqua\") are owned today by Neufville."
