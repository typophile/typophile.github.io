    know it till I read about him in Eye a few years ago.\r\n\r\nFirst, he designed
    \"Man Must Measure - the Wonderful World of Mathematics\" in 1955, which was a
    book that had a big influence on me at an early age. It didn't seem like maths
    at all, it was more like a colorful history of the world that was all pictures
    and diagrams, which I still remember, like the sun shinging down a well at the
    equator at midday, or how an abacus worked. I also recently discovered that Lancelot
    Hogben, who wrote it, was a Marxist, propagandist for progress -- those guys must
    have gotten inside my head. And then I was really into poetry when I was a teenager,
    and had all \"The Penguin Modern Poets\" with Facetti's covers. Funny, the covers
    were very mod, but the guts of the text was set in Monotype Bembo, a legacy from
    Tschicold's day.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Roget.jpg]\r\n1964.

    Designed by Keith Whitehead in 1965, Facetti was the AD. \r\nBut I got it mainly

    do that!)."

    by Hans Schmoller, or even Tschichold. Does anybody know? They seem to have had
    a series of great designers. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Penguin John

  body: "It says that the first edition was 1950. I was thinking that the covers might
    have changed, but it looks like not. In any case it must have been Hans Schmoller
    who did the design--St. Bride had an exibit on him last spring at Typotechnica.
    But a similar kind of thing, not exactly the same, was done by Tschichold, as
    I see in the Rauri McLean bio on him. \r\n\r\nWonderful stuff, the whole run of
    years of those Penguins. \r\n\r\nI guess what always attracted me particularly
    were the good looking covers that were purely typographic--no photos. These had
    a certain calm, literary quality that was lovely. \r\n\r\nThey weren't afraid
    of white space, or of type. "

    Cover</a></em>, has a spread that features some Penguin poetry books from the
    same period, also using pattern papers on the covers... Apparently they are from
    the Hans Schmoller era (post-1949). Powers also mentions that a German designer,
    Elisabeth Friedlander, created the pattern for one of the poetry covers he shows
    in his book, and adds that she began working for Penguin in 1948.

    the shortening cheat on the descender of the \"g\" in the bottom line: it has
    the \"Myriad\" form. I wonder how they did that, on demand or a special font."

  body: "Hello folks, I\u2019m new here (first post!) but I couldn\u2019t resist commenting
    on the passing of Germano Facetti. Like Nick Shinn, it was his cover designs for
    Penguin, along with Penguin\u2019s wonderful taste in typography, that awoke me
    to a love of books when I was a teenager. His cover designs for the Modern Classics
    series also introduced me to a lot of painters that, at that time, I hadn\u2019t
    come across. Under his art direction Penguin seemed to be a repository for the
    best of European culture in the 20-th Century. I had \u2014 and still have \u2014
    most of the Modern European Poets series and his Modern Classics series.  \r\n\r\nI
    think it was under him that Penguin achieved true greatness, emerging from the
    austerity of the war years to present books as a passport to enlightened values.
    After 1980, or thereabouts, British book publishing lost its way and has never
    quite recovered, imho. So much that is produced there looks shoddily conceived
    and executed. But Germano Facetti was a light that shone in my teenage years and
    I owe him a debt of thanks for that.\r\n\r\nCheers to you all \u2014 this is a
    wonderful forum for the lover of type and print.\r\n\r\nEluard"

    correct it. :-)\r\n\r\n(And from the evidence of the first few comments in this
    thread, I started out using the date of 1926, then had it changed to 1928 because
    of what I read in the British newspapers! Now I'm going to change it back.)\r\n\r\nThe
    Guardian's obituary still says 1928, if you look it up. The <a href=\"\">Times
    obituary</a> also uses the 1928 date.\r\n\r\nI've just done a search on Google
    and found some articles that give 1926 as Facetti's date of birth:\r\n\r\nhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20060416/ai_n16166320\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germano_Facetti\r\n\r\nThe
    Wikipedia article helpfully lists \"sources citing 1926 as Facetti's year of birth,
    not 1928\"! This led me to the <a href=\"http://www.designmuseum.org/design/penguin-books\">Design
    Museum's page on Penguin Books</a>:\r\n\r\n\"The rigorous application of colour,
    grid and typography in those early paperbacks instilled Penguin with a commitment
    to design from the start. The company then strengthened its design ethos under
    the direction of the German typographer Jan Tschichold (1902-1974) during the
    1940s and the Italian art director Germano Facetti (1926-) in the 1960s.\"\r\n"
