  body: "This one has kept bugging me, so I have continued hunting. I found Nick Curtis'
    version of an old ATF type called 'Tabard'. OldNick calls it <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/gandy-dancer-nf/\">Gandy
    Dancer</a>. It is a more narrow face than your sample, but un-squooshing\u2122
    could fix that. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
