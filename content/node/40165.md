  and I need some help putting it to the test. I've looked at different faces and
  set them up in my table, but I need some extreme examples (stuff that does not usually
  happen). So I'm asking for your help in looking for some faces that:\r\n\r\nA) Have
  VERY high x-ascender ratio\r\nB) Have VERY low x-ascender ratio\r\n\r\nJust a couple
  of faces of each should be enough (I don't want to steal much of your time).\r\n\r\nI'll
  post the table as soon as I have something interesting to show, as it's in its early
  stages.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!\r\n\r\n"
