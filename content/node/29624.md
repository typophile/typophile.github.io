  nested movies? I''m trying to build storyboards of Flash animations, but the stuff
  contained in nested movies within the main movie are only visible when I play it
  back as an SWF file. Exporting to quicktime or as an image sequence only shows stuff
  visible in the main movie, which is useless. '
