  drawing 100 thousand or so Northwesterners. Participants are gentle flute-playing,
  drum-circling, banjo-strumming, dope-toking hippie artists and performers of all
  generations. \r\n\r\nThe perfect place for a True Believer warning of eternal damnation!
  Look how dynamic the typographic design and color on these. One is professionally
  printed, the other hand-stenciled.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/repent-signs-10i_3790.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/warning-sign-8i_6295.JPG]\r\n\r\nThe
  sign he's carrying isn't enough, he also wears a sandwich board. This guy was dogged
  by the guitar-playing folkie behind him. \r\n\r\nI love how \"rebellious wives and
  kids\" are destined for hellfire along with murderers, thieves and sodomites. Enjoy
  this example of true folk art! "

  body: Gibson's film of the Passion relies heavily on the meditations of St Anne
    Catherine Emmerich. One of the reasons I don't like the film is that it is incapable
    of making a distinction between these pious mystical meditations and the Gospel
    account. It's a mediaeval passion play given the Hollywood treatment, and what
    it loses of the simple piety of the mediaeval drama is not made up for by the
    realism of the gore; rather the opposite.
