  body: "thx.\r\n\r\nyes, i guess you are right about numerals, but i am still reluctant
    to do the treatment. somehow i have the opinion that some characters allow this
    \"negative ink trapping\", some not, as in case of most of the numerals...\r\n\r\nsoon
    i will upload some regular & bold variants."

  body: "so, the new concept is to divide the typeface family into \xBBdisplay\xAB
    and \xBBtext\xAB cuts. i have uploaded a text version that you can find as attachment."

  body: "This is quite nice! The overall polish is very good, and the display cut
    is original but understated. However the text cut is of course way too light for
    [much] text. If you're not going to have darker weights I would suggest changing
    the naming and targeting the system for intermixed usage - that would allow for
    some very cool \"emphasis\" via the [current] display cut in a body of the [current]
    text, or vice versa! Of course in that case every glyph in the display cut would
    need some swell.\r\n\r\nLooking at the \"text\" cut:\r\n\r\nBoth \"g\"s have problems.
    The binocular one is quite unhappy; maybe make the bottom bowl larger and more
    to the right, simplify the join between the two bowls, and try making the ear
    a simple straight line. The monocular one just needs a less curly terminal I think.\r\n\r\nThe
    tittles (dots on \"i\" and \"j\") are too big. Although that would work great
    in the display cut (where I'd make them even bigger).\r\n\r\nNumerals: 4 and 8
    too narrow.\r\n\r\nSpacing: considering this will almost always be used large,
    the spacing I'd make quite a bit tighter. If you decide to keep this loose spacing,
    the wordspace needs to be bigger.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@hrant: \r\nthanks for the comments, they all make sense indeed, specially
    the \xBBg\xAB and the dots on \xBBi\xAB, \xBBj\xAB...\r\ni guess, i should try
    doing a regular version, i am facing some difficulties at the time, that will
    take some time to post something proper..\r\nyou are mentioning display version
    is a bit understated \u2013 so you are suggesting, there should be even more contrast
    betw. the elegance of the lines and the \xBBblack ink\xAB spaces?\r\n"

  body: "Actually I like the fact that the display cut is only subtly different.\r\nWhat
    you might do though is have multiple cuts with increasingly\r\nlarge swells.\r\n\r\nMost
    fonts have a Weight axis - this could have a Swell axis!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
