<div class=commentbody>Requiring registration is a far cry from censorship. I for one welcome participation in any form, whether someone cares to post under their real name or a pseudonym. <br> <br>To get back to the original topic, I really appreciate fonts that come from The Hoefler Type Foundry. Now while some may consider my opinion biased due to the fact that I have worked with Jonathan for the last few years, I have genuinely found the HTF library incredibly useful for my needs as a graphic designer. The fonts range from classic text faces to contemporary display and are very well built and battle-tested at length before being released. <br> <br>Now that Tobias Frere-Jones has joined Jonathan at HTF, I can think we can only expect great things to come.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wish I could be more articulate on this, Tiffany, but I can't really explain it clearly. To me there is a kind of 19th century feel to his typefaces, which is not to my taste. <br> <br>It isn't exactly a Classic vs Romantic thing. For example, I love Christian Schwartz's work (Orangeitalic.com), and his stuff is very expressive, like his recent Amplitude. <br> <br>I'm sure Hoefler's work deserves its success, but I must admit it doesn't grab me. <br> <br> <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>> I can't really explain it clearly. <br> <br>On the contrary, I think you did just fine! And I agree. <br> <br>Hoefler's work is deeply informed by history, probably because that turns him on. But that always entails a <i>dependency</i> too: it becomes harder to innovate. Mind you, he's done some notable innovations in the display realm, but in the darker realm of text it's much harder to escape the ghosts of the past. But if you manage, you'll really make your cultural mark. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I have a feeling our reactions are for a different reasons. <br> <br>I think text type is inherently more conservative than I suspect you think it is. <br> <br>And I don't mind revivals - I like most periods, just not Victorian. <br> <br>I have a feeling that I just don't resonate with the same historical stuff that Hoefler does. It's a way of handling detail and ornament... <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> I think text type is inherently more conservative than I suspect you think it is. <br> <br>It's certainly more "conservative" (not sure if that's the right term) than display fonts. But it's a lot less conservative than most people who make text fonts think. In fact at some points in the past (like the first quarter of the 20th century) people had a lot more balls than us. And of course the reader couldn't even tell the difference (consciously). These days the fall in the level of craft versus pretentious artistry has annihilated the consideration of what the <i>reader</i> needs, especially in the subconscious realm. <br> <br>The other day I showed a setting of Eidetic to three laymen and asked some carefully tangenial questions about how they felt about it. None of them thought there was anything notable about it! Most "serious" type designers however think it's way out there. <br> <br>Break loose from that cozy old fireplace - there's a rich world outside, it's called the future! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>What I find is most people now have an attention span of a flea. I was just in a checkout line at the supermarket and the two people in front of me were on their cell phones, trying to make a purchase and chat on the phone at the same time. The same is true with print communications, while they are looking at printed material they have the TV on in the background and a pda in hand. Typeface? What typeface?

<div class=commentbody>From Kent Lew who is having posting issues on his console: <br> <br>Hrant, AFAIK Hoefler never worked at The Font Bureau. He started under Roger Black before breaking out on his own to do type design full time. <br> <br>Meredith, FB doesn't start with infants, but they do have a good track record with interns. Christian Schwartz did a stint with FB, I believe. There have been other names who got their start at FB, whom I can't recall off hand. Dyana Weissman is currently "apprenticing" there. Coincidentally (or maybe not) most of their interns get drafted out of RISD and Yale. <br> <br>RE: Eidetic. The other day, my wife -- who generously tolerates my type obsessions -- mentioned that she was reading a book which, although she was very interested in the content, she found tiring to read and she thought it had something to do with the typeface (yes, she actually said that!).

<div class=commentbody>William, market forces play a role in the conservatism of HTF. <br> <br>The good commissions and sales for foundries are to large corporations and publications, with multi-user licensing. Those instiututions are very conservative. <br> <br>This is not to deny the innovative quality of HTF typefaces in many areas, but it is subtle. <br> <br>The designers at HTF have all done experimental, more uniquely contemporary work, but that's barely reflected in HTF's positioning. Compare the early Fetish and Gestalt with the bulk of the foundry's catalog. <br> <br>Rarely do the clients that pay best want one's most creative work. In fact, there's probably an inverse relationship between remuneration and creativity. <br> <br>The retail font market is different, you can do crazy work, but it's a crap-shoot.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick: I would say market forces also play roles <br>everywhere else. All we have to do is take a <br>look at Linotype's or MyFonts bestsellers. <br> <br>There's no coincidence on Linotype's recent <br>efforts on redesigning Univers, Optima, Avenir, <br>Sabon et al. Even knowing there are lots of <br>improvements on those fonts, I can't stop <br>wondering what would happen if the same money <br>could be invested on new typeface designs. <br> <br>I agree with Hrant: cultural progress doesn't <br>make money, at least not while it's still <br>understood as 'innovation'. Maybe that happens <br>because conservative people need to separate <br>trendy and volatile stuff from things that <br>came to stay. In typeface design it could <br>take a few decades. <br> <br>A common example of that conservative behaviour <br>found here in Brazil is the use of Officina. <br>The font is almost 15 years old, but just now <br>it became trendy, replacing most of Univers or <br>Helvetica uses everywhere. Nobody judges if <br>the replacement works, just follow the tide. <br> <br>--- <br> <br>Talking about the original subject, I have <br>great respect for the HTF fonts.

<div class=commentbody>Pioneering is always a very tough road, but probably less so in capitalist countries than others, because of general wealth and the diversity of the market. <br> <br>I have no problem with contemporary use of good typefaces from the 17th or 20th centuries. I don't care if it's conservative or innovative, as long as it's good. Of course, in typography suitability to the project is almost everything.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The observation that the big money in type is typically associated with fairly conservative design can be interpreted in a number of ways, some of them clearly dubious. Proceeding from this observation to the conclusion that capitalism inhibits innovation requires making a number of assumptions. One of these assumptions is that innovation is measurable by the amount of money paid for a single product rather than on the number of products in the market. Obviously, in a capitalist economy, the number of products in the market is very much larger than in pre-capitalist or non-capitalist societies, and this is the usual measure of relative innovation, not how much money X producer obtained for Y product. Indeed, the greater the number of competing products in a market, the lower the average price will be. Since no capitalist economy is ever a purely capitalist economy -- not least because some notions of value are inherited from pre-capitalist societies, especially in 'craft' businesses such as type design -- we should not automatically conflate conservatism in type design with a specifically capitalist status quo. Despite what the most ardent capitalists proclaim, there remain more ways of measuring value than the price the market will bear. The commissions that type designers like Jonathan and Tobias receive from magazines and newspapers reflect interesting and contradictory client desires: to have something new and fresh and distinctive, and to have something with an enduring value that is not merely fashionable. The fact that Jonathan and Tobias so regularly deliver and satisfy these contradictory desires is testament to their considerable skills.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>> Which means of course that Capitalism opposes cultural progress. <br> <br>Interesting. <br> <br>I think capitalism is actually highly dependent on cultural progress, because it is partly based on the idea of selling people stuff they either already have in some form (a stylistic or functional upgrade, if you will), that they don't really need (pure luxury) or that satisfies the basic human desires (among them: greed). <br> <br>This wouldn't be possible, if the good ol' wheel were not reinvented and remarketed as a 'brand-new must-have circular motion device' on a regular basis and if the stylistic definition of 'mainstream' didn't undergo a subtle but seismic shift every now and then. <br> <br>So, capitalism needs to at least look as if it's moving forward all of the time, even if it doesn't. It achieves this by using cultural splinter groups as 'idea incubators' on the fringes of the mainstream, testing what might work on a mass scale. If they have something, the mainstream moves to gobble it up, the fringes move elsewhere. <br> <br>The devious achievement of capitalism is in permitting and not repressing this process, a system which feeds off those that oppose it to reinvent itself and thereby stifle this opposition. <br> <br>If it weren't just human nature, I'd call it a damn cunning plan <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Good points, Refusenik. Of course, we're all assuming that cultural progress = making new and innovative things, which on reflection I don't accept. Hrant made a jump from his claim that capitalism stifles innovation to capitalism stifling cultural progress. Now, those of us pointing out the various ways in which capitalism encourages innovation (albeit without necessarily paying for it) are in danger of making the same jump: that encouraging innovation = encouraging cultural progress. <br> <br>There are various ways of reckoning cultural progress, and innovation in the marketplace is not a universal criterion. How you measure cultural progress depends largely on your own cultural values.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John -- to your list I would add that Hoefler Titling (released last year) was originally completed on commission for <i>House & Garden,</i> circa 1997. <br> <br>Tiffany -- It was <i>GQ</i> that originally used Gotham Condensed. I'm pretty sure T F-J completed that on commission prior to finishing the entire Gotham family for retail release late last year. <br> <br>Meredith -- I wish I could have attended the Hoefler/Frere-Jones presentation. Are you referring to the light slab-serif currently used for primary text in <i>MSL</i>? For some reason I thought that was called Archer, not Surveyor. Am I completely off-base, or did they change the name in the end? Or is Surveyor that revised Walbaum Italic? <br> <br>BTW, Tiff, I think <i>MSL</i> still uses Benton Gothic, which was designed by Tobias, but under the auspices of FB not HTF -- so not every MSL face is a HTF font; but you're right, it wouldn't be a bad bet to start with. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent, Archer is the slab-serif. Surveyor was based on the lettering on old maps (a bit precious, I guess, but this is Martha Stewart, after all). Really quite nice. Is it a revision of Waldbaum Italic? I dunno -- that didn't occur to me when they showed example slides of it, but it's possible. I haven't seen it in use yet. <br> <br>I thought Gotham was developed for the Lever House restoration -- or am I conflating two different projects?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Okay, thanks for the clarification. Old maps, eh? I confess that at first I thought it was just off-the-shelf Walbaum Italic -- <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/walbaum-mt/italic/ target=_blank>Monotype</a>, not <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/walbaum/italic/ target=_blank>Berthold</a>. <br> <br>Wait a minute . . . You know what?: When the redesign first came out (ca. Oct 02), when they introduced the Archer, <i>MSL</i> was using off-the-shelf Walbaum Italic. Along with a display italic that is similar in flavor -- presumably Surveyor (see Oct 02, pg. 243, for example). <br> <br>Now -- Sept 03 (my mother-in-law hasn't handed down the Oct issue yet) -- I see that they're using some of what I presume is Surveyor roman (pp. 156-163, for example). <br> <br>But they're also still using off-the-shelf Walbaum. See the article starting on p. 106, for instance. And what is that sans? That's not Benton Gothic. Looks like Tobias's digitization of S.H. de Roos's Nobel for Font Bureau. Hmmm. <br> <br>I'm not aware of the Gotham/Lever House connection, but maybe you're right. I see now, however, that the HTF catalog credits the whole Gotham family (not just the Condensed) to a <i>GQ</i> commission. <br> <br>-- K. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Still the objectives are entirely different. The objectives define the difference. <br> <br>We should not confuse capitalism with consumerism.

Otherwise what would be the point to an abundance of wealth? <br> <br>Those with bad taste often hire an art investment dealer. <br> <br>Also as we know many artist were not, and still, often are not expected to actually eat.

<div class=commentbody>I must agree, the market place is a busy place. Not always crass. Often, but not always. The marketplace has little to do with pursuits of capitalism. In fact, free markets hinder profits. Small business hinders profits. Have you ever heard of corporatism? <br> <br>Communism dealt with markets. Under Communisms there were great arts.

<div class=commentbody>> The marketplace has little to do with pursuits of capitalism. <br> <br>You are not using the word 'capitalism' in the way the word normally is used. Here is a definition of capitalism from Meriam Webster's on-line dictionary: <br> <br>"An economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market" <br> <br>The free market is part of the concept of modern capitalism. There is a struggle by large owners of capital to exercise monopolistic powers, which is restrained to a greater (eg. under Clinton) or lesser (eg. under Bush) degree. <br> <br>A free market is largely due to vigorous government policy and enforcement of laws upholding contracts and supporting fair competition. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I have tried to think more about what it is that I don't warm to in Hoefler's designs, in answer to Tiffany's question. They are of course masterfully executed. <br> <br>The thing I don't like about Victorian design, and that I sense, rightly or wrongly, in Hoefler's designs, is that ornament is somehow laid on, rather than organic. <br> <br>For example, I don't like the very sharp but old style serifs on Hoefler Text and Requiem. These are something new, I think, but to me they don't work. <br> <br>Knockout is I think by intention is more reminiscent of the Victorian predecessors than many modern sans grotesques. I don't know enough to tell you the difference, but whatever they are I don't like look. For example the wide 'a' with the small tail I don't like, and some of the way the thick-thin transitions are handled on the heavier weights. <br> <br>Now it may be that my reaction is influenced by my age. My (late) grandparents grew up in the Victorian era, and to me Victorian design always looks fussy and stuffy. <br> <br>I lived in London for five years, and saw plenty of genuine Victorian stuff, but still never warmed to it. I felt as one of my teachers back then said, that it was as if during the Georgian period the builders could do no wrong, and in the Victorian they could do no right. <br> <br>Maybe those in a younger generation, like Hoefler are less prejudiced than I and can see the merits in the Victorian taste. But to me it almost always seems to have forced and laid-on ornament. <br> <br>Just not to be misunderstood, I am not against ornament. In the art nouveau and art deco periods I think they did wonderful things with ornament--and before. Queen Victoria, I am not amused. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, <br> <br>I don't know if that is a good example. Frankly painting nymphs on rocks for 26 years is one mighty attractive consideration. ". . . you get the idea):" (the smiley face goes here) <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>In fact, I wonder if anyone will find this, way at the bottom of a 2 1/2 year old thread, but what the heck.
Jonathan didn't work for me directly, or in the same room for long stretches. He knew all about the history and styles before I found him and all I really showed him was how the spaces and spacing worked, what all the modern characters were used for, and how "the business worked." I gave him a few projects to do and he honed his skills on his own, and was soon as busy as I was. Tobias knew less about the history and styles but for him the spaces and spacing, and what all the characters were for, was natural and known, respectively. He was not interested in the business at all. And then, he absorbed the history rapidly under the influence of myself, but more from Black, Parker and Carter while my main task was to see that he had interesting projects along with the dozens he had in mind.
Whether or not you like their work, or you choose to tangent off into the relationship between commerce and art, it's an interesting duo. But what's clear to me, from reading this long dead thread, is that type design, in the case when the goal is a product, for either general or specific use, is not an art, and you need a patron, if not a client to get the best out of the best.
"I've been painting nymphs on rocks for 13 years. I could do it for another 13 years. The commercial market tempts one to repeat oneself."
But the Nymph might also have Something to do with it ... don't you think?/|\ ;)

<div class=commentbody>Great bits of "internal history" - thank you. And yeah, nymphs rule.
BTW, the Typophile "tracker"* lists threads by most-recent activity (and -if you're logged in- shows how many unread posts a thread has), which is the only way (now that email delivery is suspended) of staying on top of all the action. And since your Frankenstein-style electric jolt this thread has been towards the top of the list. But to find a dormant (never dead) thread like this [was], you'd have to throw something like "site:http://www.typophile.com berlow" at Google, and click on result #13 (at the moment). :-)
