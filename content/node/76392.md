body: This one has been bugging me for a while. Its similar to New Aster but has some
  differances, like the lowercase G.

  body: I think it's a really poorly done version of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/korinna/extra-bold/">ITC
    Korinna</a> from an 1980s-era video character generator (think bitmap fonts).
    A few of the unique oddities of Korinna are missing, but most of them are there.

  body: The lowercase G is very similar to Korinna, that's for sure. Thanks for the
    suggestion.

  body: "I agree with Mark. \r\n\r\nI also checked the Serif Guide, and this doesn't
    match any of the 1900+ families I have there. When I deselected the W from the
    characteristics I got Korinna too. It seems like a 'homogenized' version of Korinna,
    or Benguiat (both done by Ed Benguiat), with anything too odd-ball removed and
    made more conventional, like the C, G and presumably the U. The M is one earmark
    or Korinna that was retained.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
