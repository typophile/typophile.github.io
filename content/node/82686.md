  its sales figures. In book publishing it is often a known fact that such or such
  title has sold that many copies. I know the two industries are quite different (mostly
  material/digital, quick/very slow\u2026), and of course typeface licenses aren't
  as easy to count as books besause you have to take into account single licenses
  versus complete families, but still I'd be curious to know how many licenses have
  been sold of \"best sellers\" such as Meta, Gotham or Museo. How many font are the
  small foundries selling? How much does the industry of typography represent worldwide?
  etc. \r\n\r\nI know typography isn't the best place for money making, and it's great
  that we're all in it out of passion, but it's no reason to be ignorant on the matter!
  \r\n\r\nDoes any of you have some elements of answer? Do you know where I could
  find documentation on the subject? \r\n\r\nMany thanks! "

  body: "I thought about asking something similar to this question. I'm more interested
    in licenses because it occurred to me that privately-held companies wouldn't post
    anything concerning how much money they make (the same thing oldnick says in the
    previous post). Maybe just one example of the number of licenses sold for one
    font family would be enough, at least for me. It's just to get a better idea of
    the market.\r\n\r\nI'm particularly interested in some numbers from webfont retailers
    and services (like Typekit and MyFonts, although numbers from distributors/foundries
    like WebType or Typotheque would be great too), but I think that that is to much
    to ask. Maybe most designers who have thought about selling their fonts through
    some of this retailers have wondered about this or something similar.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    someone will satisfy our curiosity.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJos\xE9 Miguel Sol\xE9
