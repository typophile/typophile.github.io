  to use it for books of prose and I'm sure it would function great in my environment.
  The lack of old-style numerals, however, forced me to rethink the issue. \r\n\r\nWhat
  do you all think about it? I don't suppose it's possible to pair a face with another
  just to get different numerals. But then I also don't think that this shortcoming
  means for a fact that Mercury is not good for books (and I've seen it recomended
  here, too).\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts."

    a version with old style numerals?

    I very much prefer the colour of Mercury to that of Farnham. If I don't switch
    to Fleischmann, I'll just live without the old style numerals, which truly doesn't
    spoil Mercury's great value for prose."

    numerals, however; and which may not be available for general license, I'm not
    sure. You'd have to contact Carter & Cone.\r\n\r\nI've used Mercury a couple of
    times in books. It's quite handsome. The lack of oldstyle figures really needn't
    kill the deal."
