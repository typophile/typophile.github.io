  body: "Hello,\r\nThis font tells me something, I'll try to look, I think I have
    already seen, in any case this series ann\xE9ers ressamble to see 90 U.S. 70-80,
    with flash behind, ...\r\nAnd by and against anyone know this font, it looks like
    that of a typewriter but with a computer, ie, very clean and aligned.\r\nThis
    is a challenge that I offer here, especially with the number \"4\" and \"1\" which
    are now truly unique to see,\r\nHaving said that, in addition to the challenge

    hand,\r\nGo to pleasure, and soon I hope.\r\nBye and good morning, good appetite,
    good afternoon, good evening, good night\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Special
