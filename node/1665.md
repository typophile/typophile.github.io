  body: Unfortunately the image is quite small, but I&#39;ll do my best, the colunbia
    pictures brand looks like a condensed version of Bank Gothic whilst the HTML text
    looks like tahoma regular and bold. <BR>Can&#39;t help with the &#39;restricted&#39;
    type without a bit of research... sorry good luck

  body: Red Rooster&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/banque-gothique-rr/medium-extra-condensed/?s=COLUMBIA%2BPICTURES">Banque
    Gothique Medium Extra Condensed</a> is probably the closest varitaion of the &#39;Bank
    Gothic&#39;-style fonts. But if it doesn&#39;t nail it, the &#39;Columbia Pictures&#39;
    text is also similar to both <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-agency/">Agency
    FB</a> and Mark Simonson&#39;s <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/refrigerator.html">Refrigerator</a>.

  body: If you really need the actual graphics, and are trying to find the type to
    rebuild these, let me make it known that somewhere on the web is a site with all
    of these graphics. I can&#39;t find it. I&#39;ll post again if I do find them.
    But know that all of these are on one site. Somewhere.

  body: You can get the ratings symbols &#40;R, PG-13, etc&#41; in certain pi fonts.
    &#40;I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen one, but I can&#39;t remember where.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The &#34;RESTRICTED&#34; text looks like it could be Akzidenz, but I&#39;ve
    seen the same text in any of your standard workhorse grotesques &#40;Akzidenz,
    Univers, Helvetica, Trade Gothic, etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>The text &#34;UNDER 17...&#34;
    and &#34;STRONG VIOLENCE...&#34; is in Verdana &#40;or possibly Tahoma&#41;. Once
    again, this is by no means standard. You commonly see this text in any of the
    typefaces mentioned above. <BR> <BR>My guess is that &#34;Columbia Pictures&#34;
    is a lettering job, but that&#39;s only a guess. You can get an EPS version&#40;s&#41;
    of the logo <a href="http://logo.nino.ru/main/?text=%22columbia%2Bpictures%22&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;id=135">
