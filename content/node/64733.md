  an editable PDF so they have the ability to edit email addresses etc. as necessary.
  The only process I'm aware of that would provide anything close would be providing
  a Word template, either built custom or produced from an InDesign plug-in.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone got any other suggestions? What's the best method to use? Any and all help
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n- Colin"

  body: "Use the Form creator in Adobe Acrobat. I'm using Adobe Acrobat 9 but it works
    in lower versions as well. \r\n\r\nSelect Forms > Create new Form\r\nSelect 'Start
    with an Electronic Document'\r\nfollow the prompts.\r\nWhen asked to identify
    fields, select 'Run Auto Field Detection'. This often works better.\r\nOnce complete,
    Adobe LiveCycle will open up. \r\nHere you can modify your fields and edit its
    options. \r\n\r\nFor more info, read up on the help for Adobe LiveCycle.\r\n\r\n*LiveCycle
    should be installed already with the Adobe Creative Suite. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "@Colin: Why does it have to be a PDF if it needs to be editable? Word processors
    allow forms with fixed as well as editable contents. \r\n\r\nBTW, OpenOffice.org
    offers a plugin to edit PDFs in OOo Draw.\r\n\r\n@xil3: It cannot be safely assumed
    ;-) that Colin's client is willing to buy CS for that purpose. Field contents
    in PDF forms cannot be saved with Acrobat Reader.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

    you can use the form tools to make text fields (haven't tried myself though)\r\n\r\ngood
    luck!"

  body: Adobe Acrobat lets you make changes to the text of a PDF, as long as you embed
    the fonts AND have these fonts loaded on your computer. But the editing is limited
    to single lines (i.e., it would be tedious and painful to edit an entire paragraph!).
    Is this what your client is asking for? (It's not the same as making a form with
    fields to fill in.) Your client would have to own Acrobat, not Reader, to be able
    to edit the PDF.

  body: "@Fontgrube only the designer needs to have the CS suite. \r\nonce the form
    is created with fields, that form is usable by anyone with reader. \r\nThe contents
    will stay with the file when the file is saved.\r\n\r\nThink to when you are downloading
    a Passport application.\r\nYou can fill out digital fields and save the document
    with all fields saved.\r\n\r\nTo disable editing, you just have to secure the
    document so no one can change the content of the fields.\r\n\r\nBut whatever works
    best.\r\n\r\n"
