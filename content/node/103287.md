  will be printed on clear plastic and shown is the A side. I'll up the B side next
  which has all the details. But for the A side I just wanted to state a graphic declaration.
  What do you think of this color scheme?\r\n\r\nFor the longest time I was keen on
  using blackletter ...and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those
  who have given me their kind advice, also like to thank J.A.M. for his awesome generosity
  in letting me try out his unreleased Flamand Script.\r\n\r\nComments and crits greatly
  appreciated, thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n"

    here in a more common look. Ya, it's cleaner but not half as vibrant! I've done
    about a half dozen different color ways, I guess I'll just up them all... the
    magenta on deep brown is awesome.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\r\n5star I love the audacity of this design. It has a very distinct 90's
    digital retro feel. Try the heavier weight but you might find the slab shadow
    will lose its emphasis. It gets enough attention as is and its a bonus that you're
    using easily clashed colours like magenta and cyan & yellow.\r\nIt reminds me
    of websites with star mouse trails and MPEGS playing. This style is prominent
    in the fashion & style industry, check out http://www.openingceremony.us/ & http://www.lifelounge.com.au/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Are we talking about a business card, or a magazine cover?\r\n\r\nBy \u201Cup\u201D
    the B-side do you mean upload?\r\n\r\nRegardless, the direction of the \u201Cdrop
    shadow/3-D zoom effect is a bit trendy, and likely to date very quickly. Within
    a year I would guess. In addition, it is \u201Czooming\u201D backwards. If it
    were \u201Cbursting forward with declaration\u201D I would recommend it zoom from
    bottom left to top right, leading into the reading direction.\r\n\r\nTo make it
    more timeless, I would stick with black and red. At the very least, a dark shadow
    so that the type \u201Cdeclares\u201D its self off of the black. The yellow and
    cyan seem to exist on the same plane. If you want to switch it up a bit you could
    use a red shadow with type black. That way, it might look a little more trendy,
    hip, fashionable, contemporary &c but still stand on a colour palette that is
    a bit more timeless.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can speak a bit more about the firm, so
    we can make informed semantic decisions about the context and fitness for purpose
    instead of taking subjective aesthetic shots from the hip in the dark?"

  body: "Dan, thanks for your comment(s). 'Audacious' just about sums it up. I believe
    that anyone foolish enough brave enough to step up and declare their independence
    either through their own enterprise or whatever their means maybe, is an audacious
    act!\r\n\r\nWho are you to be free?\r\n\r\nAnd... how dare you to strive to be
    free?\r\n\r\nMy graphic firm is all about trying to communicate  that spirit of
    a declaration of independence. Within each graphic we (in vain) strive to be alive.
    Hard explain really. How do you describe a tour de force ....as compared to what?
    A polite/stale/trite center column gentile format? Really? Is that what free enterprise
    is all about ...becoming stale?\r\n\r\nI'll leave that answer to those best qualified.\r\n\r\nChris,
    thanks for your reply bro. The direction of the projection has the sole purpose
    to add tension to the composition ...and to some small degree set up the word
    GRAPHIC.  The eye then travels to the word DECLARATION and then bottom right and
    then back up to the word GRAPHIC ...and on and on it goes. A graphic declaration
    as simple as that.\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox has somewhat of the same idea. Albeit
    composed in perspective vertically stacked. I chose to present the graphic flat.
    Flat to the picture plain. The 'projection', the element which heightens the text,
    is without emotional baggage of a perspective overture . It too is flat to the
    picture plain.\r\n\r\nWhy flat? Well, that my friend is worth a semester's worth
    of lessons. Modern lessons. Non-biased lessons...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/GD_branding_bizcard_4.jpg\">\r\n\r\n...I'm
    going with DIN as our typeface of choice. Some subtle difference from my original
    choice of Berthold (and light years away from my romantic choice of blackletter),
    I think it offers a slightly more relevant openness. And by B-Side I refer to
    flip side of the business card ..just like a old skool 45 record ... B Side. Get
    it???\r\n\r\nUpped on the A side is what is shown above ...I'll up the B side
    soonish like. You know, with the firm's stuffs like what up? Contact 'n' stuff.\r\n\r\nYa?
    \r\n\r\nIt's been a long time coming ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Din is a great move in my eye. It cleans it up the edges, the colour choice
    helps with that too.\r\n\r\nYour slab shadow projection also makes for a handy
    block to print details on the back so you don't see it through the transparency.
    (It would be a good idea to get a hit of white under the colour on both sides)
    What colour ink on the reverse?\r\n\r\nI like it and your vision."
