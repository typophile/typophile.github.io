<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello Typophiles,
Am designing a display face for Hindi(devnagiri) Newspapers.
I know its a bit difficult to comment on a non-Latin script and most of you guys don't know about devanagiri but, still I bet you can :)
Its on a very early stage though.
thanks a lot.

<div class=commentbody>Satya,
I know nothing about the devanagiri script so I won't be much help.
I do notice the transitions in your curves have tension points and don't progress smoothly out of the straights. Generally, the glyphs look too grid imposed.
You might try putting a copy of all the glyphs (as you have them now) on the mask layer and then releasing points in the glyph layer and adjusting them to smoother transitions. This is also good eye training.

<div class=commentbody>This would make a good complement to Eurostile (a.k.a.: Microgramma) if, say, you were to compose bilingual newspaper headlines. But I too notice the problem Chris describes in the curves.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I am not 100% sure if what I am saying is the same as Chris & Jason, but I would venture that maybe some of the curves have goten too thick where they bend. This happens when your curves ar mechnically perfect but are not optically perfect. The two things are quite different. That said overall if find the design quite sensitive and pleasant despite what seems to be a grid-ish orientation. Congradulations.</div>

It was reported in "Times of India" that "India has a third of world's illiterates".
see http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/916814.cms
So it does not surprise that a third of the Indian population does not know how to spell the script name "Devanagari".
- Some illiterates write "devnagiri".
- Other illiterates write "devanagiri".
That's bizarre ("giri" denotes "mountain" in both Hindi and Sanskrit,
see also http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf)
Who wants to design letters of a script should at least know how to write the name of the script, shouldn't he?

<div class=commentbody>Uli: I think that when someone comes here, to the community, to share their work so that they can learn, it shows a quite remarkable level of rudeness to react in the way that you have. You should be ashamed of yourself.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I concur against Uli.
I'd say (also not knowing Devanagiri) that in general you should keep shapes from getting too close to each other. I'm going to refer to characters by coordinates here, to make it easier. Fourth row third from the left would be (4,3).
The related little enclosed areas in (4,2), (4,3), and (8,1) will probably close up at smaller sizes. The two shapes in (1,2) will almost definitely merge; (7,2) might also. In some characters your top two strokes are probably too close for comfort; probably there should be a standard distance between the two that you can stick to most of the time. I'm looking at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (3,3), (7,4), and maybe (6,4) here. And also, I think that the two lines in (5,3) should either connect or stay a bit farther apart. If I'm wrong about any of this for some reason feel free to ignore the offending part. On a positive front, I think it looks very sturdy, and I like the rounded DIN-style corners a lot. Unfortunately, I'm not qualified to offer further praise.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello Satya,
It is some time since you first started this post, and I am wondering if you have completed your work on this font. I would be very interested in seeing the result.

<div class=commentbody>Hello Tony,
Yes, I did a bit of work on this long back; but no, it's not yet completed. Frankly speaking, now when I looked at it, am finding this really ugly and badly drawn. Right now am working on some serious Indic projects and don't have much time to do personal projects. I would love to finish this at some point of time though.
Thanks for your interest.
Satya</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Satya,
Do you know any font shops that offer a curated selections of contemporary Devanagari fonts? I'm looking for a small shop, similar to a Veer or Font Bureau.
My searches have been limited by my inability to google in Hindi. The design range and quality of what I've found has not been great. Mostly free fonts. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Best wishes,
.Mike</div>
