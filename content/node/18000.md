    look at View display panels. Also think about matting and framing a few specimens
    just like a drawing or print. Mat or mount with plenty of space around your work
    so it is isolated and can be looked at without distractions. If you use 32x40
    inch panels five or six in a 20 foot area are enough with space between.

    [ Media master's degree student exhibition. Maybe that could give you some ideas?
    They seem to all plot out large, tall banners showing off their type in various
    sizes.\r\n\r\nI know someone in Offenbach who filled a room with his thesis typeface.
    He had a foot high banner running around the room, black, with white type on it.
    I think it was a continuous text about typography. Then made three foot high blocks,
    sort like the chips in scrabble. These were all black, each with a white letter
    on them. They stood in the middle of the room, and spelled out the typeface's
    name. Lastly, he had a podium behind these blocks. On that was a book, which described
    the process behind the typeface's design.\r\n\r\nI have made posters in the past
    myself. 6 x DIN A0 (I think). Each was framed, and they hung in two rows of three.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2004

    format is fine for... portraits, but for\r\ntype especially I suspect the main

  body: "About installing individual 3D letters: Tim has it right. Signpainters and
    installers, and mural painters make patterns. Here's a long version.\r\n\r\nTo
    make a pattern and transfer it on to the wall you'll need: paper for the pattern,
    pounce wheel, fine sand paper, pounce in a pounce bag, tape, rulers, tape measures.\r\n\r\nMake
    the pattern. If you had your letters made from computerized patterns, then you
    might be able to print all the copy out at size to use as paper pattern.\r\n\r\nBut
    if not get a big roll of butcher block or kraft paper. Draw a baseline on the
    paper and any other guides you might need, and place the letters on the paper
    exactly as you would have them spaced on the wall.  When you have them in place,
    weigh each letter down to help keep them in place as you carefully trace around
    each letter. Put the pattern drawing up on wall to evaluate and adjust if needed
    before perforating. \r\n\r\nYou can get a pounce wheel, which is a handle with
    a wheel that has little protruding spikes of varying sizes and spacing around
    it, at a sign supply store (some art stores) for about $4 or from Dick Blick online.
    \ The surface you will be applying the pattern to and the size of the letters
    will determine the size of the wheel you need: the coarser the wall texture and/or
    larger the letters, the bigger and coarser the pattern holes should be.  I also
    had an electro pouncer that burnt holes in the paper pattern, but it's a sizable
    investment and often literally a shocking experience.  \r\n\r\nPut the paper on
    a slightly padded surface (a rug will do if you aren't heavy handed) and carefully
    run the wheel around the outline of the letters punching a line of little holes
    through the paper. If a letter tears along the perforation, tape it back in place
    and go over it punching through the tape if possible. After perforating, gently
    sand (fine paper) the back of the paper pattern to open the holes. Tape to wall
    in place with masking or other tape that won't leave a residue or pull off paint.
    \ You can measure from floor or ceiling to baseline and/or eyeball the placement
    (not many walls are really square).\r\n\r\nYou can buy a ready-made pounce bag
    for about $15. Or you can make one yourself by filling an old sock with chalk
    dust (if surface you are applying letters to is dark) or charcoal dust (if surface
    is light) and tie it shut. 20 ounces of either chalk or charcoal pounce is only
    about $6 (Dick Blick again). Gently tap over the holes in the outline to transfer
    a dotted line of powder to the wall. Check to see if the pattern is transferring
    when you start, and that it's all there before removing.  After applying letters,
    an old towel will probably remove 99% of any overblow on the wall.\r\n\r\nInstallers
    frequently use two sided foam tape and Liquid Nails for a quick fix.\r\n\r\nHope
    this is helpful, clear and not too long winded."
