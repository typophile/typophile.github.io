  body: ' looks pretty interesting overall. the tight fit of several glyph combos
    is nice--&#34;a-n&#34; and &#34;u-n&#34;, and the varying thickness of the horizontal
    stroke &#40;tough to describe that&#41; on the m and w add interest.  <BR> <BR>i
    do think that the a is too similar to the o. did you try an older style a--similar
    to rotating the e 180 degrees?  the crossbar on the t makes for an awkward space
    to the left of that glyph. perhaps make the short side on the left of the stem,
    and the longer side to the right. does that make it feel unbalanced?  <BR> <BR>i
    don&#39;t get the reasoning behind &#34;round&#34;... '

  body: 'Tyler, <BR>Thanks for the suggestions! I changed the &#34;a&#34; and the
    &#34;t&#34; and I&#39;m happy with how they look. <BR> <BR>As for the &#34;round&#34;
    designation, I&#39;m working on two versions of the face, one called round and
    the second, pointy. The difference being the shape of the serif-like shape on
    some of the characters.  <BR> <BR><!-Attachment: jelly_new.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE
