  - How well you can tell apart the different glyphs\r\nReadability - How well those
  glyphs work together and how well they read when assembled into words, sentences,
  etc.\r\n\r\nOr does someone have a better definition?"

    glyphs apart\u201D is certainly the most important part of that. (Though not the
    only one)\r\n\r\nReadability is still used in an ambiguous way. It can be understood
    as <em>understanding</em> or <em>reading comfort</em>, two very different things.
