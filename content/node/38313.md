  building sign.  The building was put up around 1965. The Brevoort was also a hotel
  on that site dating back to the late 1800s, so the typeface could have come from
  that.  I'm hoping to place it in some historical timeframe.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Stephen.  Yes, it is pretty awesome, isn't it?\r\n\r\nI should have
    made it clear in my post: I'm not looking for a replica typeface.  I'm more looking
    for a historical timeframe to place it in so I can pair some other faces with
    it.  My gut is telling me it's from the 30s and some futura might work nicely,
    but just not sure.\r\n\r\n"
