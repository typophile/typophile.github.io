body: "I have found a nasty problem with the font validation routine in Apple\u2019s
  Font Book. Once Font Book detects some font problems it will continue to report
  any font as having unspecified problems. The only way to get Font Book to start
  validating properly is to reboot the computer every time a font is listed as having
  a problem. I <em>think</em> I had this problem when my OT KERN feature listed a
  non-existant glyph, but I cannot be sure because Font Book does not always report
  details about the the problems it finds in fonts.\r\n\r\nI believe that this problem
  exists on 10.5 and 10.6, I do not have a way to test other versions of Mac OS."

    to validate font files that are not installed on the system, so font caching should
    be irrelevant. "

  body: One way to tell if it's a cache issue or not is to change the name of the
    font (within the font, not the file name) with each new version. If the validation
    problem goes away, then it was probably a cache issue of some sort.

  body: "Sorry, I don\u2019t think I was specific enough in my description of the
    problem. It\u2019s not that this causes Font Book to report the same font as bad,
    it will report <em>any</em> font as bad. For example, if I have a six weight family
    with bold and italics, and the third font it checks out of all twelve fonts is
    bad, it will then report the following nine as bad, and if I then quit Font Book,
    restart it, and try to validate a different family, all of those fonts will show
    up as being bad as well. "

  body: I am having this same issue with fontbook 2.2.1. Any known fixes? We may not
    use font book but most Mac users likely do and having every instance of font book
    installation report an error after the initial error is not very reassuring

    FontQA and MS Font Validator. Sometimes Fontbook dislikes fonts that are out of
    spec but will work just fine."
