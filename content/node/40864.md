  \"OpenType ligature support improves the appearance of fonts in Word.\" Seen here:

  this finally mean the long-awaited breakthrough? If it's true, will there be an
  update for the PC version?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSibling"

  body: "Actually, you can see this with the previous version of Word for Mac as well,
    if you're using Leopard. Some other Mac apps also gain this capability under Leopard.
    However, with some of the apps, including Word, the total advance width of the
    base glyphs is used instead of the advance width of the ligature, which can create
    spacing problems.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of this issue, and we can hope for
    a fix.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    can make ligs with a 1:1 relationship between the total width of the base glyphs
    and the ligature width. what's the big deal?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
