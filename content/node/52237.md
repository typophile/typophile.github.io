  were sent to us from all over the world. Reviewing each and every one was a pleasure
  and very inspiring. The quality of work and the talent of all designers involved
  has really raised the bar for all future entrants.\r\n\r\nThe event is currently
  being scheduled for a few select cities across North America with our first showing
  sometime this summer. Inquiries are coming in on a regular basis and we expect to
  have a handful of exciting cities lined up for this year and next. Please keep an
  eye out on here on [[Typophile]] where we will make all the official announcements
  for TFF locations.\r\n\r\nCongratulations to the following people for being selected
  to be a part of TFF 5, and a big thank you on behalf of our team at [[Punchcut]]
  for your efforts and we look forward to showcasing your work to thousands of people
  across the globe.\r\n\r\nRui Abreu\r\nBrent Barson\r\nBirmingham City University\r\nErik
