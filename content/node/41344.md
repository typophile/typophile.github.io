  Rounded is based on a 1920s concert program lettered by Lucian Bernhard. In many
  respects Concerto is a toned-down version of the exceptionally light Bernhard Fashion.
  Concerto makes use of extensive crossbars and rounded terminals. It has two sets
  of lowercase letters, the alternate letters being slightly higher and wider than
  the ones in the first set. Cap alternates are consistent in approach with the work
  of this talented poster artist. His characteristically flamboyant display style
  is now available where legibility and readability are big issues. Concerto is equipped
  with lining and non-lining figures.\r\n\r\nConcerto Rounded and Concerto Rounded
  Alts are also available in the OpenType Std format. Some new characters have been
  added to these OpenType versions. Advanced features currently work in Adobe Creative
  Suite InDesign, Creative Suite Illustrator, and Quark XPress 7. Check for OpenType
  advanced feature support in other applications as it gradually becomes available
  with upgrades."
