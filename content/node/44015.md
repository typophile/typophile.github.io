  on a UK Spa magazine. The main thing I want to get right is the fonts. The images
  used will be mainly from PR's so to make it stand out from the rest of these magazines,
  I need to consider my type very carefully.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone had
  any suggestions for headline & body fonts. I'm open to try both Serif and Sans Serif
  for both (more than likely use 2 header fonts throughout if they compliment each
  other).\r\n\r\nI've been drawn to Adobe Caslon and Arno so far (body), but any other
  suggestions would be most welcome.\r\n\r\nThe client really liked Avant Garde as
  a header, but I'm aware that its been everywhere recently so would like to come
  up with an alternative.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is aimed at (and I quote): \"Yummy mummy's,
  high end consumers, Harrods shopper, general managers and spa directors\". I think
  this translates as they want a sophisticated, luxurious feel. That's my aim when
  choosing fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for putting me on to the Renko, I'm particularly interested in Museo,
    I'll give it a try. I haven't got a massive budget so would struggle to justify
    anything excessive. I do have a lot of fonts available to me though, just not
    uploaded on my system, so I'm looking for recommendations first to see if I already
    have them, before uploading any.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions appreciated.\r\n\r\nG*"
