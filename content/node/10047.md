body: Hi, <BR> <BR>can anyone take me through the automatic font weight creation in
  font lab? I followed the manual, but can&#39;t get any results &#40;i.e. the grey
  preview doesn&#39;t change when changing the slider in the axis window&#41;. <BR>
  <BR>I want to create a light version of a medium font, so nothing too drastic. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks <BR>Nicole
