    Nokia Cellphone</a>... but I can&#39;t quite pinpoint the other face... take a
    look around <a href="http://dafont.com/en/bitmap.php">DaFont&#39;s Bitmap Fonts</a>
    and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find something that suits you.

  body: Well, I think, both, actually, are &#39;Tahoma&#39;.. <BR><i>&#40; The bold
    and regular weights of &#39;Tahoma&#39;, that would be.. &#41; <BR> <BR>&#39;Nokia
    Cellphone&#39; has various different characters.. &#40; &#39;G&#39;, for example..
    &#41; <BR>Ryan, did you take a look at &#39;Tahoma&#39;.?</i>

  body: Sorry about that, I didn&#39;t realize that Nokia had some funny characters...
    but I&#39;ve always seen Tahoma with anti-aliasing so I guess I didn&#39;t see
    it like you did...
