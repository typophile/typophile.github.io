  body: "... but I think a nice understated piece of type.\r\n\r\nCouple of comments...
    maybe the 'B' symbol is a fraction small in the circle? and the cap 'L' in LaBelle
    looks a very slightly heavier weight that the other characters, but it may be
    a visual onscreen thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like it, but also think the proportions between the 'B' and the circle are
    a bit extreme.

  body: I really like this. But I also think the proportion of the mark is a little
    off, and the consistency of the letters.

  body: "I think lightening up the weight of the B in the circle will fix the balance
    - I disagree that the L is too heavy, it seems just right.\r\n\r\nVery nice!"
