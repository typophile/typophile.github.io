body: "Calling Paul D Hunt (and anyone else who cares to comment)...\r\n\r\nI have
  some questions on the subject of P22 Underground Pro, the answers to which might
  interest others too:\r\n\r\n(1) When it says that Underground is licensed to P22,
  does that mean that P22 Underground Pro sticks rigidly to the original which I assume
  still belongs to the London Transport Museum? Or did you redraw it entirely, and
  if so, why does it still belong to the LTM (if it does, that is) or is it now a
  P22 font? I realise the nuts and bolts of the arrangement with LTM may be sensitive
  information.\r\n\r\n(2) Where does P22 Underground Pro fit in with the New Johnston
  family which is what Transport for London now use? Is there a connection at all
  (other than having a common ancestor)?\r\n\r\n(3) In what ways does P22 Underground
  Pro differ stylistically/in appearance from New Johnston (is it just more faithful
  to the original?/is it the original and best?) or ITC Johnston which is different
  again and can presumably be classed as a revival of sorts? Do you see P22 Underground
  Pro as a revival?\r\n\r\n(4) How were the other guys who are credited on the pdf
  involved with the design?\r\n\r\n(5) Did the original Underground font really have
  the corners snicked off microscopically? What's the thinking behind that, if any?\r\n\r\nLove
  it, by the way, especially the pdf which has already been complimented in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39734\">this
  thread</a>.\r\n\r\nFinally, is there a place on Typophile where this kind of information
  about individual  typefaces can be found? It occurs to me that between us, there
  must be a lot of info about fonts that will disappear just as quickly as we do unless
  it is documented somewhere. Or are we just relying on what Wikipedia says? (This
  discussion may or may not warrant a thread in its own right.)\r\n\r\nFor example,
  I have some (albeit fairly trivial) information on one or two typefaces that I don't
  suppose anyone else knows. So where do I leave this info for posterity's sake? Wikipedia?
  Surely not.\r\n\r\nInterested in your thoughts.\r\n\r\nN\r\n\r\n"

    to these questions, especially #5.\r\nI'm guessing there is quite a close connection
    to the original drawings as the font comes with lots of alternate characters suggesting
    the indecision of initial drawings. (This is pure assumption on my behalf.)\r\n\r\nAs
    for your last point, Typowiki!"

  body: "Hello Nick,\r\n\r\nthere are already two threads about P22 Underground Pro,
    at least:\r\nIn addition to the aforementioned <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39734\">Underground
    Unbound</a>, announcing the PDF specimen, there\u2019s <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/38787\">Appropriate
    alternates or an anachronism?</a>, started by [[Paul Hunt]] while the fonts still
    were in the making.\r\nIf you want to share your knowledge, I think it won\u2019t
    be a bad idea to add it to either of these existing threads. And I second Andrew\u2019s
    suggestion, the Typowiki is a good place, too. Yes, anyone can edit the entries,
    that\u2019s the idea. Just start here: [[P22 Underground Pro]]. And then add a
    link to the list of [[Typefaces]].\r\nF"

    the record I do not think it is anachronistic to add alternatives \u2013 surely
    it would be anachronistic <em>not</em> to include them! Anachronism is most annoying
    when it is unintended.)\r\n\r\nAnother version of Johnston I have been seeing
    a lot of lately is <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/resources/corporate/projectsandschemes/artmusicdesign/pfa/images/anna-barriball/off-to-work.gif\">this.</a>
    A better image <a href=\"image http://www.flickr.com/photos/alastairhumphreys/3246786637/\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nNotice
    the pinched tittle and vertical terminal on the 5. Anyone know which version this
    is?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    think it was done by Eiichi Kono as part of a Banks and Miles overhaul of the

  body: "1) Contact P22\r\n\r\n2) P22 Underground and New Johnston share a common
    heritage, that is all.\r\n\r\n3) P22 Underground is an attempt to revive the original
    type by Johnston retaining imperfections such as super-low contrast, the long
    tail on the l, &c. My rationale was that it is these 'imperfections' that give
    the face charm. New Johnston is a less-strict revival, but still retains many
    of the qualities of the original but has taken some liberties to improve the face
    for its purposes.\r\n\r\n4) Persons listed in the credits on the PDF beta-tested
    the fonts, gave feedback, critiques or lent images for the PDF.\r\n\r\n5) Not
    that I know of. The original type was a wood type, the nicked corners were incorporated
    to give a sense of softening of edges that might have been associated with the
    types having been made from wood. Otherwise, I included these as a design feature
    partially due to my own aversion of sharp corners.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other
    questions, you can post them here or email me:\r\npaul (@t) p22 (d.t) com."

  body: "(1) \r\nLicensing and design are two separate issues. The London Transport
    Museum granted P22 a license to use their intellectual property to recreate the
    original Johnston design for LT. LT has a very strong identity and IP protection.
    Even though the font was redrawn from \"scratch\", having the official licensing
    makes it an authorized \"product\". There are many reason this was the only way
    to go for this project.\r\n\r\n(2)\r\nNew Johnston is the official face of LT
    as designed for them by Banks & Miles. It varies from the original Johnston in
    several ways.\r\nP22 Johnston Underground was the basic font done in 1998. It
    is a very close facsimile of the original Johnston and doe snot follow New Johnston.\r\nP22
    Underground Pro is Paul Hunt's refined and expanded version of P22 Johnston Underground.
    It is less like the original Johnston than the first P22 version but more than
    New Johnston.\r\n\r\n(3) \r\nOverlaps with above answer. Sure call it a revival.\r\n\r\n(4)
    \r\nPaul did pretty much all of the Pro set on his own. I smoked Cuban cigars
    and stood over his shoulder saying: \"Hunt...isn't that damned thing done yet!\"\r\n\r\n(5)
    \r\nThe corner bumping was something I decided to do for P22 Johnston Underground
    since we were working from woodtype specimens and I didn't want sharp corners
    at large sizes. It was an experiment to see if it would soften (and therefore
    make less digital) the overall feel of the font."
