  I think \u2018experimental typography\u2019 is a self-reflection; it can never result
  in the final solution and is primarily intended for theoretical discussion.\r\n\r\nHow
  would you define it?"

    I'm confused by your statement -- what is the relationship between typographic
    space and experimental typography?"

  body: Ricardo - In my thesis, I am stating that the use of space in typograohic
    design by their very nature are dependent on and defined by convetions. I also
    state that these common patterns have inspired me to use experimental typography
    in my practical work in order to investigate the use of space in typographic layouts.
    Now, I need to clearly state what I mean by 'typographic experiment'. There are
    a lot of definitions made by a lot of designs but none seem to be clear or defined.

  body: "ana. \r\n\r\n[ I would say ]  ::  'experimental typography' is the process
    creating letterforms for the sake of the form itself \u2014 not for the purpose
    of expression or legibility, but for the sole reason of interpreting the alphabetic
    symbol as a shape with infinite possibilities of positive and negative space.
    \r\n\r\nThat's just my opinion (in a run-on sentence).\r\n\r\nGood luck with your
    thesis!"
