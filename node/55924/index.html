  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">/ THE CHALLENGE

Arial was created as a substitute for Helvetica, but most graphic designers consider it a poor substitute, and avoid using it if they can. 

The challenge is to redesign Arial, perhaps with small changes, perhaps with major changes, but to make it into an alternative to Helvetica that a designer could love, maybe even prefer. <cite>Making it look like Helvetica is not allowed.</cite> Making it more easily distinguished from Helvetica is a plus. Just as Arial's metrics are identical (or nearly so) and its weight and proportions similar, so should the "fixed" version.

Winner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.

		<div class="commentbody">Basically, what's wrong with Arial is it's too up tight. It needs to un-wind. 

It needs a freaking vacation!

It is not that it is good or bad. Just an overworked typeface trying to fit in where it wasn't really wanted and being wanted where it doesn't really fit in. It feels guilty for being forced to do Helvetica's job, even thought Helvetica has been overworked for years and years. Designers, the only people on the planet who could pick Arial out in a police line-up, despise Arial for being a cheap impostor, even if they also despise Helvetica. The fact is, because of its interloper status, it never really gets judged for its merit. It's always, "Oh, that Helvetica wannabe, Arial…" Not that most people judge it all. It's just a steady work horse to most, who gets called time and time again to fill in for somebody else because he'll work for less, or he's just there: "Here's a pile-o-crap, would you clean it up for me." Arial says, "B,b,b, But …" but accepts the shovel, sighs and gets to work. "here's a load of cod's wollop. would you dress it up and make it smell nice." Arial says, "B,b,b, but,…"

So, my solution was to help Arial relax. Get it out of that suit. Send it to the spa for some pampering and a nice massage. The whole nine yards. In the Caribbean. On the beach. 

If you want to relax a typeface, what do you do? Why, of course, you convert lines to curves, make them smooth & you remove nodes. Lots and lots of them.

Arialicious: Arial is so relaxed, he's downright counter-culture. Hand that kid a dooby.

Comarial Sans: The tie is loosened, the top button opened, but he's ready to work. Maybe something not too demanding down in shipping.

Helvarial: Think mullet. Hockey-hair… Business in the front, party in the back back.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree ... Arial's really wound up tight. 
Was it not also designed to be a more on-screen counterpart of Helvetica? Back in the days of lower res monitors, it made a difference in smaller sizes, like in body text. You only had like 7 pixels and no anti-aliasing to define your caps, and Helvetica's humanistic roundness didn't resolve as nicely as Arial's straighter lines.

Now that screen resolutions have all but obliterated Arial's advantage, let's take the typeface back to its roots to inject some character back into it. Maybe take some influence from Grotesk and Gothic faces. And fix some real annoyances while we're at it. Like that God-awful cap R leg. And the fugly lowercase a and r. Here's a quick go at it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arialnext_6519.gif]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, in contemplating this challenge I had to do a bit of looking (please forgive my amateurish naivety) and I'm wondering if Corbel, to some extent, was meant to achieve this? One thing that bothers me about both Arial and Helvetica is that the caps don't seem to mix well with the lower case letters. Some of the corbel caps mix better, I think, and I think it looks nicer than Arial without looking more like Helvetica. (I realize that the point of the battle is for me to come up with my own alternative, but if I were to spend the time I think I'd scrap Arial and Helvetica and start elsewhere.)

Why would editing outlines be prohibited? I don't have Fontographer so how would you propose fixing Arial or creating swashes otherwise? This is a serious question but I feel like an ignoramus asking it.</div>

What you end up with when you "convert to outlines" is a bunch of shapes that look like Arial, not a "reverse engineered" font. If graphics programs had a "convert outlines back into text" command, then there might be reason for concern. 

If anyone is still worried about the issue, you can always work on paper or in a paint program, such as Photoshop.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I assumed some people would edit in FontLab, because playing with outlines in Illustrator is a nightmare (no constrain on tangents etc). Arial most regularly exists as TrueType and converting to outlines creates lots of extra points. 

I'm confused by the different views I hear on Typophile, for me I think that element of an EULA is prohibitive and IMHO a bit unnecessary, type battles would suggest that other people are comfortable to let it pass (me included, Russ the kitten is safe).

My hope is that Arial will, in fact, gain a bit of respect as a result of this battle. It is easy for me to hate on typefaces because they are popular, or because they have flaws, or even because their origins are perceived as being dubious. Comic Sans sucks. Ok, draw a better comic sans. Not so easy. I'm not commenting on the quality of any executions in this thread, only observing that as I worked on my entry below, I decided Arial deserves more credit that I give it. Next battle: improve Papyrus (good luck).

What I did: I contemporized Arial while fixing a few of the flaws (bad curves on the a, width of the a, anemic r, high-waisted R). The result is a blunt terminal Cholla meets Info meets Helvetica typeface that is still pretty bland:

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Stephen. And thanks for the Heldustry link, I don't think I've seen that typeface before. I would really have fancied it, if it weren't for those useless rings in Å and å. It's amazing how lazily many professional type designers treat diacritics used in languages they don't know. So I guess I have to polish up my own quick sketch of a typeface. I actually obeyed (as the only contestant so far, I think) the requirement of using Arial's exact widths, which severely compromised some of the shapes, the G and the R being the worst examples.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First off, I love these entries. I simply wish that Arial got half the creative thought displayed here when it was first designed. :/

This is my entry. Registered just to show my work, though I fear it's rather subpar. 

Mostly I've edited the capital E, F, G, Q, R and the lowercase a and e, as well as the 1 and 0. I don't know how 'improved' this makes Arial, but it allows me to play with some things I've wanted to implement in my own (forthcoming) typeface. The lowercase 'e' is the best example of this, with the disconnected cross stroke. The capital R is the only thing I've 'improved', but that's because everyone hates the uppercase R. 

Thoughts?

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting that everyone identifies the cap R as public enemy number one. I totally agree. Most people diagnosing the problem with amputation (myself included). While the leg is less then ideal, to me it is not the worst problem. The problem is that the bowl is too small and the letter is too wide. Fix those two issues, and you have a credible R, even with a wonky leg. Don't fix them, and it doesn't matter what kind of prosthesis you affix.

The instructions do mention however that this fix should be made "an alternative to Helvetica that a designer could love, maybe even prefer" whereas my take seems more like a display font and would probably not reduce to text size very well.  Then again, I'm pretty sure we may have a difficult time convincing any designer that use Helvetica religiously to prefer a re-vamped version of Arial :)</div>

I boldly called the project "Arial Corrected". Fellow typographers here in Brazil were afraid of intellectual property conflict, so I changed the name to "Aerial", then "Ariel" (both already in use for commercial typefaces) and finally "Work in Progress" (only a dumb placeholder name).
In its present state, the changes are still subtle. It's basically Arial minus all those silly oblique endings; straightened R, K, G, Q and a; rounder, less squarish curves; better diacriticals. It became somewhat more like Univers rather than Helvetica.
But the gist of the current challenge is different. People here want to redesign it. My original proposal was to "fix" Arial only where it bothered me the most, improving it without messing with it too much. But I know I will not be satisfied unless I redesign every glyph from scratch, maybe including some optical effect such as stylized ink traps.
The Black weight was the starting point because it is the most popular of ANY typeface among common people in Brazil. Everywhere you go, it's impossible to avoid coming across multiple instances of Arial Black, usually set in CorelDraw and crudely compressed or expanded to fit the available space. It's an epidemic. We really need to do something...
Corbel really seems to be a reinvention of Arial. There is also a free Linux typeface that was specifically designed to substitute Arial. It's called Liberation Sans.</div>
