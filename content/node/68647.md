  body: "I met Denis Pelli at TypeCon last year, and thoroughly enjoyed both his company
    and his presentation.\r\n\r\nThe conference title reminds me of a story told by
    the late British poet laureate and lover of English provincial architecture John
    Betjeman. He was attracted to a public talk by a poster advertising \u2018The
    Pleasures of Reading\u2019, and was deeply disappointed when he arrived and discovered
    that the talk was about reading, not Reading."

    is the new black</a>.\r\n\r\nCan anyone find this thread? Search feature isn't
    helping.\r\n\r\n(I think I finally nailed the link syntax. I always preview before
    I post, and I think I discovered a bug. Even if a link is broken, it still previews
    blue, thus giving a false impression that it's coded correctly.)\r\n\r\n"

    Berlow doesn\u2019t have a headshot. (Perhaps he\u2019ll appear in trench coat

    do not view these as reassuring indicators."

    we shall see. Meanwhile, here is an\r\nintriguing typographic image by Solomon
    and Pelli: the \r\ncover of the journal Nature, vol. 369, no. 6479, June 2, \r\n1994.
    The accompanying article is \"The visual filter \r\nmediating letter identification\".
    I should emphasize that\r\nI'm not saying this is what Prof Pelli will talk about
    at RIT \r\nin June, but I think it's fun to look at - Bookman in a\r\ndigital
    sandstorm. \r\n\r\nhttp://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/pubs/solomon1994filter.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n@
