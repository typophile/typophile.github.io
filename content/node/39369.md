  body: Many thanks Stephen. It is very close but the "s" of course doesn't match...
    I think it is more something from T26 Foundry or Identikal...

  body: "Thanks. I think it is more something like [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/Monark|Identikal
    Monark]] but manually rounded... But the \"s\" doesn't match...\r\nThere's also
    [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/Utopy|T26 Utopy]] but not rounded and the \"s\" is
    totally off...\r\nThe \"s\" looks like it comes from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/platelet/|Platelet]]...
    but not exactly..."

    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/reflex/\">Reflex</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/leger/\">Leger</a>.
    The oblong counters, curved l, and strange 'g' were getting my attention more
    than the s.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
