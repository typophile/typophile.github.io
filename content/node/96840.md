  body: "Previously discussed [[http://www.typophile.com/node/80342|here]] but it
    came up with nothing unfortunately. So I guess it could be considered as a custom
    lettering by [[http://www.ill-studio.com/works/view-all/69-vans-syndicate.htm|ill
    studio]].\r\nIt's somehow loosely similar to some [[http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/AdobeGaramondPro.pdf|Garamond
    Italic]] (some interesting swash italic letters) or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/goudy-wtc/|Goudy
    Swash]]."
