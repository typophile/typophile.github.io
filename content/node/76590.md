body: "Bruichladdich is a small sophsicated distillery that produces single islay
  malt whisky in Scotland. I have always enjoyed the typography treatments on almost
  all of the packaging design they have in my local liqour store. I wonder who designed
  the fun image & text on those packaging designs. If anyone know, please let me know!

    was \r\nshower gel. Or maybe aftershave. :-\\  Doesn't \xABfeel\xBB like whisky
    at all\u2026 \r\n(Does Bold Blocky Clean Helvetica Style really work for <em>everything</em>?)"

  body: "Nina, \r\n\r\nYou are correct, not always. I understand where you are coming
    from. The word \"bold\" is definitely accurate description of this whisky. \r\n\r\nThe
    reason why I felt that the clean, blocky and bold Helvetica works because the
    hierarchy of information became interactive when you turn the packaging around. "

  body: On the other hand Nina, this kind of 1970s retro design may be appropriate
    for an aged scotch; but at first glance I would assume PC6 is only six years old.
