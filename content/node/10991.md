    was a Linotype version as well. Just guessing here.

    Mono and foundry. The machine casting versions in 1967. Two years later Linotype
    quit making its machines. <BR> <BR>Barbou was Monotype&#39;s last, in 1968.

  body: Mark -- <BR> <BR>That&#39;s not it. I didn&#39;t know that Auriga was produced
    in metal. Matthew began that design while at Crosfield; and I think Crosfield
    only produced photocomposition machines. He finished the face when he came over
    to work with Mike at MLCo. But I didn&#39;t think it was cut in metal matrices.
    I could be wrong. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Auriga predates the design I have in mind,
    just slightly. But you&#39;re getting closer. <BR> <BR>Remember, it was a newspaper
    face -- newspapers being the last bastion of Linotype metal typesetting for many
    years. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: 'Peter -- <BR> <BR>It seemed like you were just guessing, and I was going
    to make you pick one. But you may have caught me up on this one. <BR> <BR>My answer
    was Olympian, designed for Mergenthaler Linotype Co. by Matthew Carter in 1970
    for release in both metal matrices and photofilm. &#40;The production drawings
    were done by the talented draughtsman George Ostrochulski.&#41; My source for
    this was a conversation I had a month ago with Mike Parker, who was Director of
    Type Development. Olympian was the last new design to be cut in metal here in
    the States. It was designed, in part, to respond to the increasingly narrow restrictions
    of TTS standards. &#40;Hey, there&#39;s another good trivia question: TTS -- what
    does it stand for and what was it? Oh well, next time.&#41; <BR> <BR>When MLCo.
    closed down matrix manufacture here early in the 70s, they transferred all metal
    manufacture to Linotype &amp; Machinery Ltd. &#40;English Linotype&#41;. Tracy
    was typographic director for L&amp;M, and it seems that Times Europa was cut by
    L&amp;M a little later than Olympian. The evidence I&#39;ve found suggests that
    it was indeed made for metal. Mike obviously wasn&#39;t thinking about L&amp;M
    when we were talking. <BR> <BR> <BR>Anyway, in either case, I declare Peter the
    winner. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.'

    <BR>Stephen -- Pabst was always &#34;antiqued&#34;, with wobbly edges built in
    right from the get-go in metal. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Pabst Old Style was cool. Pabst
    Roman was sort of the precurser to Souvenir.</i> <BR> <BR>Gerald -- According
    to McGrew, Pabst Oldstyle and Pabst Roman are very nearly the same. It&#39;s Pabst
    Extra Bold that looks like a precursor to Souvenir &#40;if it hadn&#39;t been
    designed 14 years after the fact&#41;. Pabst Extra Bold is in the vein of Souvenir
    Bold and Cooper Black. <BR> <BR>The rules forbid me from answering this question,
    but can I give a hint? Walter Tracy discusses Pabst in his chapter on Goudy, although
    he neglects to list the German foundry by name. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: Oh! Oh! I know this one!  <BR>  <BR>In newspaper context, TTS stands for Teletypesetter.
    There were a few variants of this technology, but basically they all involved
    remote keyboarding and transmission by wire or cable &#40;telegraph&#41; direct
    to a linecaster, phototypesetter or, later, digital typesetting system. Although
    it would work with any font on the target typesetting system, TTS&#39;s efficiency
    contributed to the increase in content in daily newspapers, and so indirectly
    generated a large demand for condensed typefaces. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s
    the impact on type design you were thinking of, Kent; I can&#39;t think of another,
    more direct impact.

  body: John -- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to give this one to you, just to keep things
    moving along.  <BR> <BR>The third part of your answer, however, is not quite complete.
    The TTS system mandated a set of character widths, to which a font had to conform
    in order to perform properly. &#40;I&#39;m not sure why this was so, but I think
    it may have had to do with consistent line counts for the syndicated material.&#41;
    These prescribed widths were fixed, &#42;independent&#42; of type size. As the
    tendency grew among newspapers to increase body size, the rigid widths meant progressively
    narrower letterforms and ever more condensed newspaper faces. That&#39;s the impact
    on type design I had in mind. <BR> <BR>Apparently, much of Jackson Burke&#39;s
    tenure at MLCo. was taken up &#40;regrettably&#41; with most of his staff redrawing
    and recutting Corona over and over for TTS systems. <BR> <BR>With Olympian, Carter
    and Parker took the lessons of the Legibility Series but applied an oldstyle stress.
    This allowed Carter to move the thickest point of a curve off the extreme horizontal
    positions, where space was at a premium, and thus achieve a more open counter
    on a narrower width. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: Thanks for the extra information, Kent. I wasn&#39;t aware of the fixed character
    widths. My guess is that this is not something inherent to the idea of TTS, but
    simply to its implementation in newspaper settings, e.g. to achieve consistent
    line counts as you suggest. In other words, the idea of remote keyboarding sent
    to a typesetter by telegraph doesn&#39;t rely on set widths. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    post a new question shortly.

    it had demonstrated its value in a much more mundane utility. What was it? <BR>
