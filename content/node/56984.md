  body: "Hello Robert. I\xB4m suspect to say that but I disagree with you. Off course
    this is not a typeface for a mass journal, when a rapid comprehension of the headine
    is the key. This kind of typeface is for specific audience and when I was designing
    Eklipse I have this in mind. \r\n\r\nMarcox, Quincunx, James thanks for the compliments.
    James, as you said is really difficult to create something new in this kind of
    style.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRafael"

  body: Nice. I could see this getting a lot of use with the screenprinted concert
    poster crowd. The backwards characters are a great idea. Well done.
