body: "This is my first posting though I've read the forum for a while. I'm currently
  designing my 1st open type font for Veer, which was going relatively ok till now.
  \r\n\r\nI have added  a number of contextual features including some beginning and
  ending glyph substitution. In order to do this I used a text class and used it with
  the swsh feature. That part is as follows (leaving off the rest for brevity):\r\n\r\nfeature
  swsh { \r\n\tignore sub [n l r]' @text;\r\n\tsub [e e.alt i i.alt l r r.alt2] [l
  l.alt]' space by l.swsh;\r\n\tsub [e e.alt i i.alt r.alt2] [r r.alt2]' space by
  r.swsh;\r\n\tsub n' space by n;\r\n\tsub n' by n.swsh;\r\nI tried various ways of
  doing this before it finally seemed to compile and work as I expected in the preview.
  The @text I defined was the basic lowercase and some ligs and punctuation. Today
  I went to add some class based kerning for the accent characters. After hitting
  the \"apply and save\" button it created a kern feature in the open type panel.
  When I try to compile with that I get an error message that seems to be pointing
  to characters from my text class even though I don't have that listed as a kerning
  class. \r\nReads: <Shoebop> glyph class not defined (text was \"@_o\") [Macintosh
  HD:Applications:FontLab 4.6:fontlab.fea 378] \r\nI tried varios other things and
  the error number changes, not the problem. \r\nIn the kern feature I see a whole
  seperate lookup called k2 that has the letters that are in both my @text class and
  my kerning classes.\r\n\r\nAnybody know how I can maintain my contextual endings/
  beginnings and still use the class based kerning?\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp "

    FontLab version are you using? 4.6? If so, move to v5.x if you can.\r\n\r\n> <em>glyph
    class not defined (text was \u201C@_o\u201D)</em>\r\n\r\nIn the Classes panel
    you can define (at least) two kinds of classes: OpenType classes, and Kerning
    classes. The name of the latter should always start with an underscore (_). That
    output suggests that you've not defined the class named '_o'. The Classes panel
    should have an entry that looks more or less like this:\r\n<code>_o: o' oacute
    ograve otilde ocircumflex</code>"

    version of FL is 4.6.\r\n(tried to include a preview image but haven't figured
    out how yet).\r\nThere are several e glyphs involved; one for doubl e's; one for
    end of word and one for end of line. \r\nWhen class kerning creates a kern feature
    my manually kerned pairs are listed first:\r\nfeature kern {\r\n  lookup k1 {\r\n
    \  pos n b 8;\r\n   pos n d -8;\r\n   pos n quoteright -33;\r\n   pos c b 19;\r\n
    \  pos c f 16;\r\netc...\r\n\r\nThen the class based is listed:\r\nlookup k2 {\r\n
    \  pos n @_o -8;\r\n   pos c @_o 13;\r\n   pos c @_u 16;\r\n   pos c @_e 13;\r\n
    \  pos c @_y 19;\r\n   pos M @_u 18;\r\n   pos M @_y 13;\r\n   pos i @_c 10;\r\n
    \  pos i @_n 13;\r\n   pos i @_e 8;\r\n   pos i @_o 11;\r\n   pos i @_y 18; \r\netc...\r\n\r\nThere
    is a K3 section as well which appears to be class based listings from left and
    right columns that I left unchecked.  My first instinct was that my @text class
    is incorrect. When I first created it in the classes window the feature code didn't
    seem to recognize it so I copies it and put it in the open type feature as:\r\n@text
    = [exclam parenright ......] \r\n\r\nBeing knew at this I suspect there is something
    obvious I'm not seeing. The feature code, I think, is probably a bit overly complex
    for my 1st open type design. Adam Twardoch gave me the idea fot the @text part
    of the code. When he did it I don't recall him having to create the class for
    @text at all. Maybe that is a difference from FL4.6 and FL5.\r\nStephen\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you have the option \"Add all glyph classes to OpenType...\" checked. (I think
    it is unchecked by default.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ot_classes_6503.png]\r\n\r\nI
    believe this will solve your problems.\r\n\r\nBTW, the 'kern' feature created
    by FL4.6 is quite bad, since it divides the pairs in lookups. In some circumstances
    this will create kerning bugs, as it is described here:\r\n-- <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/FontLab/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=3192\">Summing
    Kerning Pairs</a>.\r\nThat's why I recommended moving to FL5."

  body: "Thanks Miguel. \r\n\r\nI checked that in preferences just before opening
    the font. After opening I went to kerning assistant and hit apply and save again.
    In the open type window when I hit the compile I got the following message:\r\n<Shoebop>
    Glyph class @Shoebop redefined [Macintosh HD:Applications:FontLab 4.6:fontlab.fea
    16] \r\nIt doesn't say error and did compile and test ok in the preview. I will
    generate it today and see if everything works. \r\n\r\nStephen\r\n"
