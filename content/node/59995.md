  package design for typefaces. At this stage I am struggling to decide which typefaces
  I should select for packaging. I am thinking of more classic typefaces that stood
  the test of time. Please help with suggestions...\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\nG."

    the specific letterforms of different typefaces...

  body: Great suggestion. So far I figured out the actual physical shape of the package
    but still trying to decide on which typeface to pick. There are so many I would
    like to do but at the end I only need around 10...the question is which ones?!?
    :)I love them all
