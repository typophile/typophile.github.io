		<div class="commentbody">I have only just stumbled upon this thread. Haven't got time to read all of it, but remembered that I've had similar discussions before. I think a list is a great idea, especially if it is such a personal test. It'll make us all feel good. It will, however, not change the world of type-usage out there one bit.  I have my own theory about the success of certain faces and it would be nice to explore at some point how something as despicable as Avantgarde Gothic or something as sickly cute as Optima ever became so popular. But then, your present president took his post with less of a quarter of the adult population of this country having voted for him. One Steve Jobs with an old Linotype catalog in his garage had a bigger influence on the course of typedesign than all living typedesigners together. <BR> <BR>A few years ago, a journalist asked me what I thought were the ten most popular typefaces in use today. His question implied that those would also be the ten best typefaces of all time.  <BR> <BR>Here is an excerpt from my answer: <BR> <BR>1. What makes a good typeface is decided by the users, not the designer. <BR> <BR>2. Most good typefaces have been designed for one purpose, they do not come <BR>from a designer</div>

What makes a good typeface is decided by the users, not the designer. <BR> <BR>In terms of popularity, sure. But what about quality? For example, the &quot;users&quot; of movie theatres choose the stupidest stuff. <BR> <BR>BTW, I guess there's nothing interesting to do in San Francisco on a Sunday night since the .com implosion? (I know there certainly isn't in Glendale, at *any* time of the week.) I've heard that all the sushi bars in SF are now Denny's.  ;-) <BR> <BR>&gt; When we talk about the ten most used typefaces, I am not sure which culture we are looking at. <BR>&gt; &hellip;. <BR>&gt; I presume we mean the Western world, but we should all be aware that these presumptions are very arrogant and very unprecise.  <BR> <BR>Right on! <BR>Well, my list of 10 (which I thought we were not supposed to reveal before the 15th&hellip;) has one non-Latin font in it. The problem, of course, is how do you judge a font in a script you're not familiar with? So maybe when somebody presents a list he/she should state its scope. <BR> <BR>&gt; we read best what we read most. <BR> <BR>But we also read best what we read best, no? <BR> <BR>Anyway, I thought your list was very informative! Thanks. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow! Erik Spiekermann! An immortal amongst us!  <BR>Erik is spot on here. There's no point in pretending to be objective. Just choose your favorites. Trouble is, I don't think anyone here would be particularly interested in my top ten as it would probably include such boring fonts as Cheltenham and Plantin - and where's the fun in that?! The 2001 idea is not bad - but not exactly easy to be sure of as release dates are never clear after a font is launched. Plus there are so many new fonts released in a year, and nobody keeps track of them all. Not unless someone wants to start IFDB.com, along the lines of the Internet Movie Database - imdb.com.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; There's no point in pretending to be objective. <BR>&gt; Just choose your favorites. <BR> <BR>Totally. <BR> <BR>But dude, Plantin is a man among boys - it's the real thing (as opposed to Times, the Prom King). I don't care if the lc &quot;a&quot; has a flawed pedigree - it more than makes up for it. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I'm one of those crazies who thinks that Cheltenham (the real one, not the ITC caricature) deserved its popularity: it has a distinct charm, and a unique readability. I think the fact that it was designed by a non-type-designer tends to mar the objectivity of some stodgy -or overly conservative, or overly pedantic- type designers (like Tracy, as much as I admire him for other things). And maybe the same negative forces are at work in the denial of the true origin of Times - but that's another can of worms. <BR> <BR>BTW, I thought Cooper university (no, it's not a school where you learn to make chocolate letters) had something like an &quot;IFDB&quot;. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
