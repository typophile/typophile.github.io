  who know the Font industry's online presence backwards, so I'd love to know the
  hierarchical state of third party Font sellers.\r\n\r\nFor instance, as I regularly
  get the MyFonts newsletter I was wondering whether MyFonts has a direct competitor?
  Are they the biggest? Is there someone bigger? Or someone on the horizon taking
  ground?\r\n\r\nWho has the greatest piece of the pie when selling other designers
  Fonts?\r\nWho's below them?\r\n\r\nCheers In Advance for any knowledge.\r\n\r\nDrj "

    Monotype Imaging and Bitstream are publicly traded companies the actual revenue
    numbers are probably posted somewhere. '

    would be related. Monotype Imaging''s slice of the pie would be skewed by their
    historical library offerings.   '
