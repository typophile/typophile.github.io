  Barenaked guide to music copyright reform\r\n \r\nSteven Page\r\nNational Post\r\n\r\nMonday,
  May 01, 2006\r\n\r\nThe Canadian music scene has been riding a remarkable wave in
  recent months, with packed clubs, breakout artists, and international acclaim. While
  that success has garnered considerable attention, last week a group of well-known
  Canadian musicians took centre stage for another reason.\r\n\r\nConcerned with the
  prospect of record-label lawsuits against MP3 file sharers, and the continuing march
  toward greater restrictions on the use of music, the artists -- including Avril
  Lavigne, Sarah McLachlan, Chantal Kreviazuk, Sum 41, Broken Social Scene, Stars,
  Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace, Dave Bidini of Rheostatics, Billy Talent, John K.
  Sampson of Weakerthans, Sloan, Andrew Cash, Bob Wiseman, a co-founder of Blue Rodeo,
  and my own band, the Barenaked Ladies -- launched the Canadian Music Creators Coalition.\r\n\r\nThe
  Coalition brings together a diverse array of musical backgrounds and interests.
  We create everything from popular top-40 tunes to critically acclaimed selections
  to grassroots folk songs. We make rock, pop, blues, jazz, R&B, hip hop, folk, country
  and even classical music. We play various roles in the music production process.
  We are not just singers and songwriters (although most of us write or perform our
  own music to some extent). Some of us are also record producers and music promoters,
  for ourselves or other artists.\r\n\r\nCollectively, we have won dozens of Juno
  and Grammy awards, and have sold tens of millions of albums worldwide. Most, although
  not all, of us are associated with major record labels, collecting societies and
  industry associations. We know that record companies and music publishers are not
  our enemies. They are often run by people who love music and are passionate about
  the promotion of Canadian culture.\r\n\r\nMuch of their lobbying, however, is not
  about protecting artists or promoting Canadian culture. It is about propping up
  business models in the recording industry that are quickly becoming obsolete and
  unsustainable. It is about preserving foreign-based power structures and further
  entrenching the labels' role as industry gatekeepers. Their lobbying efforts are
  focused on passing laws that restrict artists' ability to take control of their
  own music, reach their fans in more direct ways and earn a decent living from music
  without sacrificing their autonomy.\r\n\r\nWe, as Canadian music creators, have
  identified three simple principles that should guide copyright reform and cultural
  policy.\r\n\r\n- First, we believe that suing our fans is destructive and hypocritical.
  We do not want to sue music fans, and we do not want to distort the law to coerce
  fans into conforming to a rigid digital market artificially constructed by the major
  labels.\r\n\r\n- Second, we believe that the use of digital locks, frequently referred
  to as technological protection measures, are risky and counterproductive. We do
  not support using digital locks to increase the labels' control over the distribution,
  use and enjoyment of music, nor do we support laws that prohibit circumvention of
  such technological measures, including Canadian accession to the World Intellectual
  Property Organization's Internet Treaties. These treaties are designed to give control
  to major labels and take choices away from artists and consumers. Laws should protect
  artists and consumers, not restrictive technologies.\r\n\r\n- Third, we strongly
  believe that cultural policy should support actual Canadian artists. We call on
  the Canadian government to firmly commit to programs that support Canadian music
  talent. The government should make a long-term commitment to grow support mechanisms
  such as the Canada Music Fund and FACTOR, invest in music training and education,
  create limited tax shelters for copyright royalties, protect artists from inequalities
  in bargaining power and make collecting societies more transparent.\r\n\r\nThe immediate
  reaction to the new coalition has been incredibly positive. Dozens of additional
  Canadian artists, including Randy Bachman, Sam Roberts, Feist and Blue Rodeo's Greg
  Keelor, have all jumped on board. Music fans across Canada and around the world
  have expressed their support as we repair the bonds between artists and their fans.\r\n\r\nThe
  \"products of the mind\" for which the record labels claim to seek protection are
  the products of our minds. The legislative proposals that would facilitate lawsuits
  against our fans or increase the labels' control over the enjoyment of music are
  not made in our names.\r\n\r\nIt is the government's responsibility to protect Canadian
  artists from exploitation. This requires a firm commitment from Industry Minister
  Maxime Bernier and Canadian Heritage Minister Bev Oda to programs that support Canadian
  music talent and a fresh approach to copyright law reform. The continued growth
  of Canada's vibrant music scene requires policies that priorize musicians, not outdated
  business and the corporate bottom line.\r\n\r\nSteven Page is a member of the Barenaked
  Ladies and a founder of the Canadian Music Creators Coalition. The CMCC will hold
  its first public meeting in Toronto today.\r\n\xA9 National Post 2006"
