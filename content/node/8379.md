body: Hello everyone <BR> <BR>I am a first time poster on this forum and would appreciate
  help with the following. <BR> <BR>I require small dots to be placed under approximately
  six letters of the alphabet in order to represent certain characters from a foreign
  language. I am interested in having this done to the Adobe Minion Pro or a similar
  typeface. Any help would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Abdur
