  body: "I agree, Akira, that those are the lining figures of Archer Semibold. As
    Martha Stewart, for whom the typeface was developed, would say \"it's a good thing.\"
    A monoline slab serif with ball terminals from typewriter letterforms--a very
    efficient and effective design. I checked the numbers category at H&FJ but missed
    the numbers on the Archer page. My bad.\r\nDon"
