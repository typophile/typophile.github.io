body: Which typeface do you believe most encapsulates the word &#39;fear&#39;. I am
  doing a study into typographic reactions to words, there have been some great responses
  so far. All the results will be published on my website with an accompanying conclusion.
  <BR> <BR>It would be fantastic if people could respond, I&#39;d really appreciate
  it. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: 'from the shatter site: <BR> <BR><i>Shatter is an experimental font from Vic
    Carless, designed in 1973. Despite the centuries between the year of its creation
    and today, the font still has a distinctly modern feel.</i> <BR> <BR>I guess 1973
    <i>technically</i> was another century...'

  body: I&#39;m with Raph&#39;s Trajan nomination here. It&#39;s those serifs. It&#39;s
    nasty, calculated serial killer stuff. Hannibal Lecter and what-not. It does seem
    to be becoming one of those &#34;y&#39;know, it&#39;s just used for that kind
    of thing and that&#39;s that&#34;. It&#39;s on a billion books about everything
    too.

  body: Blackletter &#40;and BL-inspired work, like that of Margo Chase and Mr. Hrant
    Papazian&#41; always scares the crap out of me. But then, I&#39;m Jewish. Real,
    true, visceral fear is partly a cultural construct, so some of these might only
    scare the crap out of some people.

  body: I think you&#39;re certainly right that culture is a huge factor - for example
    certain Thai forms look decidedly evil to me even when they&#39;re actually <i>divine</i>
    for Thais! But there are also physicaly realities that all people share &#40;since
    we&#39;re all human animals after all&#41;. For example that sharp things hurt.
    And that an upper overbite is sinister &#40;picture an eagle&#39;s beak&#41; while
    a lower overbite is carnal &#40;think of an ape&#39;s snout&#41;. I&#39;ve used
    things like this in my Daam Entity. <BR> <BR>BTW, drop the salutation and surname,
    habeebi!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;d think fear would be best implied in a subtle manner, I can see how
    Trajan would have a more powerful impact than something that blantly tried to
    &#34;look&#34; like fear, whatever that may be.  <BR> <BR>Now Wedding Text, for
    instance; there is real substantial fear there that transcends the extraordinary.
