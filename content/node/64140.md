  body: "Loads of Adobe's Pro sets.\r\n\r\nGaramond Premier has a nice Greek. Myriad
    Pro has that as well, with Cyrillic added into the mix. Top font must be Minion
    Pro: all characters for practically every Latin based language, including loads
    of (rare!) novely African orthographic ones, such as capital Eng, <em>and</em>
    a very nice serif Cyrillic, <em>and</em> a very nice modern Greek <em>as well
    as</em> enough ancient Greek to typeset the odd original Plato quote.\r\n\r\nI
    think that's as far as 'proper' typefaces can go. Some of the huge CJK fonts (MS
    Mincho, SimSun) also have lots of glyphs, but they really lack any quality.\r\n\r\n[Ed.]
    One set of glyphs I'm sadly missing in Minion Pro are for common Chinese transcription
    -- circumflex and caron on all vowels. Fortunately, it has a full set of accents
    (and, unfortunately again, only the non-combining flavour)."
