    similar stuff anyone?

  body: "Okay, just some thoughts:\r\nThe \u2018M\u2019 stands out, you can find that
    one in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/blackcompressed/\">Interstate</a>.
    By contrast, the almost-a-perfect-circle \u2018O\u2019 seems to be from a completely
    different source, rather like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/heavy/\">Futura</a>.
    The geometric, cut-off \u2018C\u2019 looks even more technical, like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/zatro/bold/\">Zatro</a>,
    but quirkier.\r\nThe overall feeling, regardless of the particular letterforms,
    reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/aterbar/at-erbar-condensed-medium/\">Erbar
    (Condensed)</a>.\r\n\r\nCheers, F"
