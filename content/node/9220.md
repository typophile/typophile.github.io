  body: Yves suggested Caslon among others... <BR>How about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/caslon-no-224/"
    target="_blank"> Caslon 224</a> which is also from the hand of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/benguiat/edward/"
    target="_blank"> Edward Benguiat</a>?

  body: Perhaps not a transitional face, but somehow I see some similarities <BR>between
    Tiffany and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-esprit/" target="_blank">
    Esprit</a> too - especially in the heavyer weights. <BR> <BR>- or is it just me???

  body: I missed this thread somehow... <BR> <BR>A couple of faces which are relatives
    of ITC Tiffany &#40;or rather relatives to the faces which inspired it&#41; are
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-old-style/" target="_blank">Century
    Old Style</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/binny-old-style-mt/"
    target="_blank">Binny Old Style</a>. Depending on what you are after, they might
    work.
