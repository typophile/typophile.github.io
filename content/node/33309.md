body: "I'm doing a poster for a film set in North Africa in 1963. I'm figuring the
  roman-lettering title font ought to reflect a French design aesthetic from that
  era, since that would probably have been the dominant design influence.\r\n\r\nBut
  which fonts? Vend\xF4me? Or go for Choc/Mistral? Anything I'm not thinking of?"

    is a great idea. Less obvious. But the best type has a lot to do with the tone
    of the film. Can you tell us more about that?"

  body: "Yep, found the path to the French posters, thanks.\r\n\r\nThe film is a story
    about how and why many of Morocco's Jews left for Israel in 1963. I actually don't
    know much about the plot (poster designers don't always get a full screening,
    unfortunately)."

    like something serious and dramatic. Too literal and it might seem kitschy. V\xEAndome
    used judiciously with another sans would probably be best. IMHO"

    which is inspired by Antique Olive. I happen to like that it's not quite as smooth
    as Antique Olive.

      >Nouvelle Vague movie posters</a>, because there's was an important shift in
      the esthetics from the style of the previously mentioned posters to the new
      wave realism, end of 50's, beginning of 60's. There's a lot of material on the
      site, but you should maybe search for Truffaut, Godard, Alain Resnais or Agnes
      Varda for the most iconic posters.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of French movie poster
      layouts of the time, I think of something like the Paris Match example Nick
      posted, with a similar typeface and the one-sided layout. Like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/truffaut_3845.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
      Antique Olive seems to catch the feeling too, although I don't think this is
      the original poster (I hope I ID'd the face correctly):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_bout_de_souffle_4324.jpg]"
