body: "Hey,\n\nI'm trying to do a typeface, first one actually. I usually do graphic
  design so I'm not pretending to be good at designing typefaces, but for some reason
  I got stuck with the idea of a \"g\" and really had to draw it on some piece of
  paper, I kind of liked it so I digitized it and then it grew up to this in the last
  few days. I actually kind of like it, so I thought I'd show what I have for now.
  It's not even a complete first draft of the lowercase, and I'm unsure about a few
  parts but so far I like it. I tried a bunch of words and I also think it reads well,
  pretty much what I intended in the first place. \n\nSo, what do you think about
  it?\n\n"

  body: Whats the intention of this typeface? What is it categorized under? How many
    weights? Lots of questions to answer before starting a typeface. A lot of people
    design faces for the purpose of having it in their "portfolio" and thats no way
    to start a typedesign project.

  body: "Well, since it's my first one I didn't really have a purpose for it in the
    first place other that I wanted to have something readable, mainly for setting
    medium lenght texts. I know I should have something clearer, a \"real\" purpose
    but I just don't think I have something that can be qualified as such.\r\n\r\nI
    think where I'd like to lead it is something fresh, lively, that could be effectively
    used in a real text at about 11 or 12 with space to breath. I'd like some nice
    \"funky\" lines while staying subtle, clean.\r\n\r\nWhat it is categorized under,
    I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nWheights, well, I'd like something clear, light-weight.
    What I have for now I would describe as the normal \"roman\" weight. I'll start
    with this weight for now, but eventually would like to develop a bold version
    and a true italic of the roman if it turns into something acceptable.\r\n\r\nThat's
    not for portfolio (well not for now), but exploration solely. "

  body: "Doesn't a typeface sort of communicate its own intent? People will use it
    for whatever they feel it is appropriate for. I see a quaint casual organic face.
    Do you expect him to say, \"I was aiming for a stark, sterile geometric font suitable
    for headlines in a business newspaper,\" so you can say \"Whoa, you got that <em>all</em>
    wrong!\" and what would that accomplish?\r\n\r\nAnyway, my critique: I think the
    i/j dot should be much higher, and a different shape. Round, or a small vertical
    line, or possibly even a ring."

  body: "Cerulean,\r\nim not saying that at all. A designer can take ANY face and
    do whatever he/she intends to do with it, even if it defeats the original intention
    of the type-designer, as long as it works. But if you have a clearly defined purpose
    for the face, then all these things affects the actual design of it...In other
    words the intention affects the type design.\r\n\r\nSort of like how a graphic
    designer starts an identity without considering the audience, environment, history
    etc. I hope I'm making sense here."
