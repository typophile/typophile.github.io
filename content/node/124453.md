  body: "|PROTOCOL| is some form of condensed Didot/Bodoni. Haven\u2019t found a match
    yet.\r\n\r\n|Ltd| (or at least |Lt|) appears to be Rage Italic. Either the |d|
    was edited or brought in from  some other typeface (haven\u2019t found a match
    to it):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rage-italic/\r\n\r\nThe rest
    appears to be garden-variety Helvetica:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/"

  body: "Everything I\u2019m finding for |PROTOCOL| is close, but not quite right.
    Fashion Compressed and Fashion Didot have the right general form, but are missing
    the horizontal (as opposed to upturned) terminal on the leg of the |R| and the
    double-serifed |C|:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/fashion-compressed/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/fashion-didot/\r\n"
