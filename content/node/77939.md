  body: "<em>Steak</em> is the main attraction, but right now my eye goes first to
    <em>cheese</em> and <em>eggs</em>, because of the yellow color and the egg glyphs.
    Maybe make <em>steak</em> red?\r\n\r\nI find the swash <em>A</em> distracting.
    I like the swash because it harmonizes with the ampersand and the decorative flourish
    at the upper right, and I like the thinness of the letter in contrast to the heavy
    slab serif for <em>steak</em>. But <em>A</em> isn't information--it's just the
    indefinite article. Is there a swash <em>T</em> in that font that you could use
    for the <em>T</em> in <em>T-bone</em>?\r\n\r\nCan you find a swirly ampersand
    with greater contrast between thick & thin strokes, so it looks more like the
    initial letter at the upper left?\r\n\r\nUnless this is an ad for Welch's Grape
    Juice, <em>Welch's Grape</em> is getting way too much emphasis here. (Of course,
    I wouldn't order grape juice anyway. Depending on the time of day, I'd wash this
    meal down with a big mug of black coffee or a nice cold beer.)\r\n\r\nReturning
    to our original topic (typography, if I recall), I'd play down <em>Welch's Grape</em>,
    and use a font that works better with the rest of your design. Try something along
    the Bodoni/Century line, not too bold. And maybe make it purple.\r\n\r\nI kind
    of like the sketchy style of the face, but he looks too angry. I would look happier
    if I were about to eat this meal. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I definitely agree with the above statements, especially regarding hierarchy.
    I think you're missing a comma. Right now it reads \"A t-bone steak cheese, eggs
    & welch's grapes.\" Need a comma after \"steak.\" \r\n\r\nThe font choices are
    pretty nice, but what is the context of this? Why is this semi-thug looking guy
    ordering breakfast? Would a thuggish man speak in a matter that inspires a curlycue
    A? "
