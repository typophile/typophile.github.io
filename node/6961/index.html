<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Can anyone inform me how I might discover what faces were used in the first edition printings of the fictional writings of Samuel Clemens? I am particularly interested in fonts that were used to publish his short stories.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Micah <br> <br>I would think that there is no reason to assume that any particular face would have been used. Laurence J. Johnson's Caslon was a fairly common American face at that time. A Google search might serve you well or go to one of the Mark Twain sites. <br> <br>Clemens did serve as a printer's devil as a youth (nice photo of him holding a composing stick on the cover of one of the back issue _Printing History_ journals) and, interestingly enough, he is considered the first author to submit a manuscript using the typewriter. And lost a bunch of money in the development of a mechanical typesetting machine.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, Thanks. <br> <br>I was strongly leaning towards Caslon (Adobe's)... <br> <br>I did quite a bit of disappointing Google searching before posting here. :-( <br> <br>Because of his experience in printing, I rather suspected he might have had a hand in choosing the design of his books, but I also was prepared to strongly disagree with how the first prints were set; particularly in choice and use of face. Still, knowing what was originally chosen could help me to make intelligent choices of my own, as in keeping with the original spirit as possible...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Micah <br> <br>If you are thinking of a digital and would like to get close to the Johnson Caslon try Lanston's Caslon Oldstyle 337. It is pretty much right on the money a very good rendition of the metal Monotype version, which is considered the truest to the Johnson. The Johnson type itself was said to cast from original Caslon punches or matrices (I forget which).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, <br> <br><i>"The Johnson type itself was said to cast from original Caslon punches or matrices (I forget which)."</i> <br> <br>Johnson made strikes from the original punches. Lanston gained access to the same punches for their cutting. I am not sure if you read the article I wrote on the subject? <br> <br><a href=http://lanstontype.com/CaslonGiampa.html target=_blank>http://lanstontype.com/CaslonGiampa.html</a> <br> <br>Maybe I should post a pdf version of this edition of <i>"The Fount"</i> <a href=http://lanstontype.com/CaslonATF.html target=_blank>http://lanstontype.com/CaslonATF.html</a> on the Lanston web site. By the way, I am thinking of publishing a new edition of <i>"The Fount"</i> and was thinking of asking you to write an article for it?</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>And lost a bunch of money in the development of a mechanical typesetting machine.</i> <br> <br>The machine was called the "Paige Typesetter". Paige is spelled correctly, it was named after the inventor. <br><a href=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/yankee/cymach6.html target=_blank>http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/yankee/cymach6.html</a> I ordered photocopies of the mechanical drawings from the patent office. Patent office photocopies were very reasonable. The response to this particular request met with heated resistance. It was, I believe they said, the largest patent ever filed. Linotype ended up with two machines, they needed some of the patents. One the machines were donated to the museum, the other to the war effort. <br> <br>We saw great "financial wisdom" in cancelling our order. I think trucking was the problem.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald G <br> <br>Yeah, I most likely did read your article on the subject and, if around 1993, would have used it in a review of your Caslon for _The Typographer_ (mentioned recently elsewhere on another Typophile thread). <br> <br>Liked _The Fount_ a lot. Had a bit of class to it in a world then not all that concerned with class. Sure, if you get it together, I'd be honored to contribute. <br> <br>Gerald L</div>
