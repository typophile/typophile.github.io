body: I have the Adobe Creative Suite (indesign, photoshop, etc) installed. Normally
  when I only had Illustrator CS2 installed I could find the font adobefnt.lst files
  very easily, now it's hard to determine what file it is. Before when I tested fonts
  in different formats (ps, tt, ot) I would close illustrator, uninstall the font
  files, and before installing the next format, delete the illustrator font list file
  or files. Now when I do a search I get way more .lst files to choose from. I only
  see one that is in the Adobe Illustrator CS4 Settings folder, so I'm guessing that's
  the one, but I'm afraid I'm going to delete something important. Thanks for any
  help.

    been modified since December 10th, the day I installed. There are two files that
    have been modified today and those are: AdobeFnt11 (located in AppData\Local\Adobe)
    and AdobeSysFnt09 (located in AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Acrobat) so it may be one
    of those files.'
