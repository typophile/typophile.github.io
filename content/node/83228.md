    Gothic]], which is a 2007 revival of Thomas Hollingworth\u2019s Informal Gothic
    (1965).\r\n\r\nSee [[http://typophile.com/node/42716|this Typophile node]], too. "

    of\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/rhode/mediumcondensed/\">Rhode
    Condensed Medium</a> or\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gothic-rr/bold-condensed/\">Gothic

  body: "Yes, they are very near, and these were made by typeface designers with a
    lot of experience in old foundries...\r\nAnd they got models from the supoerb
    sans serifs coming from metal.\r\nThe point is that these fonts (Rhode and Gothic
    RR) were made later, in the 90\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAnd the Penguin cover we have was
    published in 1972.\r\n\r\nPerhaps is hot metal (or impressions on gloss paper
    with hot types from Stephenson Blake or similar?)"

    The design goes back to 1906, originally by ATF.
