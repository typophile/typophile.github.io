body: I saw Kill Bill 2 tonight and noticed during the film, a font on a set of outdoor
  chairs which said &#34;SOL&#34;. <BR> <BR>The font in particular was a beautiful
  circus/western blend - I undertand this would have been hand rendered, and I am
  unable to find an example. <BR> <BR>If anybody does have any shots from this film,
  of this type - could you please respond.  <BR> <BR>I would like to use the same
  style for a logo I am working on. Once I saw it, I knew it would be perfect. <BR>
  <BR>While on the subject of fonts used for circus&#39;s. Does anybody know the historical
  information behind the use of fonts used for circus&#39;s? <BR> <BR>mwah
