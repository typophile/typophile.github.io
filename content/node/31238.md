    It\u2019s called an <strong>alveolar trill</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe <em>r</em> in
    \u201Crojo\u201D isn\u2019t rolled, it\u2019s the <em>rr</em> sound in \u201Cperro\u201D

    in pronounciation keys. It isn't a natural American English sound, so I wouldn't
    expect to find it in American dictionaries, but what about Spanish dictionaries?"

  body: "I finally found this again -- I was fascinated to find that some Latin American
    type designers have taken it upon themselves to create ch, rr, and ll ligatures
    to reflect the fact that these are considered separate letters in Spanish (although,
    to my understanding, ch is now two letters according to the RAE). Cristian Gonzalez's
    Origen uses all of these, plus a ck ligature (image from a \"seleccion_typecon\"
    PDF I have on my computer, maybe from the Letras Latinas website). I'd find it
    difficult to read the rr ligature in text, but maybe this is a mildly common thing
    in Spanish writing to do. Just thought this was a cool thing to bring up -- I
    don't have much to say about phonetics.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OrigenLigs_5660.jpg]"

  body: What about the digraph rr where the two r's fit together like the digraphs
    ae & oe? I have been meaning to double check if it exists in the unicode yet.
    It may just be a Catalan thing not a spanish thing. I don't know. I think it corresponds
    with the Alveolar flap.

  body: "I came across this thread from Eben's link on another thread.  The LL ligature
    is something I've seen a little more often, but haven't really seen anything standard
    for the ll.  Ch and ch seems to be getting a little more usage in Spanish typography.
    \ The rr ligature I've never seen before, and certainly isn't used in handwriting
    (but then again, neither is the Ch or ll).  \r\n\r\nThe symbol commonly used in
    American dictionaries for a alveolar trill is either r-acute or r-macron, depending
    on style.  In IPA, an alveolar trill is a standard r, whilst an alveolar flap
    is an r without a full termination on the loop.\r\n\r\nAlso, rojo is pronounced
    with a full alveolar trill.  All <em>r</em>'s at the beginning or end of a word,
    or following certain phonemes are realised as trills.  Incidentally, with the
    exception of Indian or Scottish English, an phonetic transcription of English
    would never have either types of r (words like, well, <em>word</em> actually have
    a an alveolar or retroflex approximates, which are represented by an r-turned
    or an r-turned-hooked.  \r\n\r\nAnd cuttlefish, in some dialects of Spanish (Rioplatense)
    it can be realised as a uvular trill (just as in some Caribbean or Mexican dialects
    it can be realised as in English).  But the so-called \"standard Spanish\" it's
    an alveolar trill.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas
