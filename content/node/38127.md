  don't have access to their original files. Does this font look familiar to anyone?
  I've gone the Identifont and What The Font route, to no avail.\r\n\r\nI'm actually
  thinking that it might be a custom job, but that's my uneducated gut feeling about
  it.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great!\r\n\r\n"
