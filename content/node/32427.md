  body: "We need posters with solid magenta and yellow avatars :)\r\n\r\nThe resemblance
    is moreso in the serif (especially italics), the sans is more grot than the Gillish
    Freight Sans.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: There are many CE fonts in the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?mid=2">FontFont
    library</a> and over 1300 on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?advanced=1&params[searchtype]=fonts&search[cblockop]=|&search[cblocks][]=ce&refby=typographica">MyFonts</a>.
    Maybe you can tell us more about your project and we can help you narrow it down.

  body: "The fontfont library is not the most easily searched database I have to say.
    \r\n\r\nWe are designing a new newspaper, and so the serif will nestle tightly
    together with shortish asc/desc. This could potentially also work for the headline
    weight, but all options are open right now. The same is the case with the sans.
    Cheers!"

    a fine feature, for sure.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.ourtype.be/\">Fresco</a>
    for your project which is available as in OT Pro fonts."

    DSType, Flat-it, P22, to name a few that have larger offerings of CE fonts). \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"
