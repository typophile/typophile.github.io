body: "A predecessor created Word documents using several non-system fonts that were
  apparently installed on his computer, but nowhere else. I have identified and installed
  all but one of the \"rogue\" fonts, but cannot figure out what this font, which
  is used on the title page of several documents from the early 2000s, is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/US
  Sample 1_5839.png]\r\n\r\nIn some documents, it shows up fine, but in others it
  shows up like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/US Sample 2_6511.png]\r\n\r\nIn
  other documents, the same text will be readable or boxes depending on whether other
  Word documents are open when it is opened. Readable letters include the following:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/US
  Sample 3_3591.png]\r\n\r\nThe Word documents identify the font as \"US.\" I apologize
  in advance if there is such a font that I have just been unable to locate. Thanks. "
