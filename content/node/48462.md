  they are properly installed and turn up fine in other programs?\r\nEg: A huge family
  of fonts like Helvetica Neue, would have one or two weights go missing when I'm
  using Flash.\r\n\r\nIt happens in MS Word too.\r\n\r\nI can't tell you how annoying
  it is. I'm on OSX 10.5.4 and all my software are original.\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed
  some light on this, esp how to fix or work around it?\r\nI've tried disabling some
  fonts, but it does not help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
