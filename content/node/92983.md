  />\r\n\r\nHerbie is a uppercase display font with alternates on every character
  (lowercase), based only on circles and geometric lines. Herbie is inspired by, as
  the name might indicate, Herb Lubalin's work and the decorative style and kerning
  of his era.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://cargocollective.com/infamousfoundry/Herbie\">http://cargocollective.com/infamousfoundry/Herbie</a>\r\n"
