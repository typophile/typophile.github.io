  his <a href="http://www.toffeeshop.com" target="_blank">Toffee Shop</a> in time
  for the holidays. He and his wife send me this stuff every year and it&#39;s the
  best I&#39;ve ever had &#40;no, really&#41;. Apparently it&#39;s a family secret
  from their Hirschi side of the family. <BR> <BR>Anyway, give some to your clients
  for the holidays, they&#39;ll like you better. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.toffeeshop.com"

  but I get good karma and maybe Brad will send me some extra this year. ]
