  that each mosaic has a slightly different version of a serif font but if you know
  anything about any of them, I would greatly appreciate it. Even if you just know
  of a similar serif font, that would be great, too. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/86thstreet_3850.480.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I expect that the letters were made from templates that were done for NYC
    Transit Authority, and not based on a specific typeface. Those E's certainly don't
    look like anything I've seen before, except on those subway signs (I'm originally
    from NYC myself).\r\n\r\nAs for anything similar, Cheltenham or Cushing are styles
    that I think are old-ish. You could search for 1900s serifs at MyFonts. I suspect
    you could make a lot of fonts look right if you put them in the mosaic frames
    and backgrounds.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I'm fairly certain the font is Cheltenham. It was designed in the late 1890s
    and made available commercially around 1903, just in time for Heins & LaFarg,
    the architects of the new subway system, to incorporate into their designs. There
    is considerable variation in the typeforms in the subway mosaics based on Cheltenham,
    but the giveaway are the cap A, the cap G, the cap R and the cap S.Significant
    variants in the font based on Cheltenham are the cap E and the cap S. Doesn't
    matter. It's genius all the way around.
