  to use on my Mac.\r\nBut those fonts seem to have some non-ASCII chars stored in
  their PS Names and TTF Names tables as I see them in fontforge, which are shown
  garbled in other apps' font menus. They also don't have proper style names which
  I'd like to set in order.\r\n\r\nThus I'd like to modify those metadata without
  changing anything else in those fonts.\r\nIs there any tool suited for such purpose?\r\n(The
  tool can be a command line tool or one that works on Windows, although my final
  goal is to use the fonts on my Mac.)\r\n\r\nI've tried to do that with fontforge,
  but the generated TTFs somehow seems to lack something (maybe vertical metrics info?)
  that they look messed up when I try to typeset them vertically (which is not the
  case with original fonts). It's a crucial problem since those are Japanese fonts
  and should allow vertical typesetting.\r\nI'm not really familiar with fontforge
  nor with font data structure, so I must be missing something, but since I only need
  to fix the font names, I thought that a fully equipped app like fontforge is too
  much and there should be some simpler solution.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate if you could
  give me any suggestion.\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
