  wondering whats the preferred way of setting c.  ?\r\nIm using text figures. Is
  it a lowercase c or a latin small c?\r\nI read in a book that its better if you
  use text figures with\r\nlower case and titling figures with upper case.\r\nShould
  the c. be the same size as the numerals?\r\nIs this the general rule that everyone
  uses?\r\nI have seen some books with titling numerals with lowercase,\r\nand to
  be honest it looks odd. Some of the books are well designed\r\nsome of them not
  (these are the ones I don't trust)\r\n\r\nD."

    is only one of many possibilities. The only hard, fast rule is that should be
    NO period following the c

    however, <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em> recommends: \"Common Latin abbreviations
    such as 'etc,' 'eg,' 'ie,' are set in roman type without punctuation.\" This includes
    <strong>c</strong> for <strong>circa</strong>; <strong>c.</strong> is commonly
    used as an abbreviation for <strong>century</strong>. So, \"circa 16th century\"
    would translate as \"c 16th c.\" Or not..."

  body: "Perhaps one of the reasons that the \"no period\" version doesn't look as
    logical as it used to is that we come across a lot of mixed alpha-numeric \"words\"
    these days, eg (ha!) in passwords.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the abbreviation for software
    versions is \" v4.3\" rather than v.4.3, and being a minimalist, I would stick
    with Chicago.\r\n\r\nAlso, Bringhurst is in the tradition of \"anti-unnecessary
    marks\", which he characterizes as filling text with grapeshot (or something similar,
    can't remember exactly)."

    far as I can tell, omitting the periods is a fairly recent British convention."

    Hart's Rules suggest any abbreviation that has the first and last letter needn't
    be punctuated whereas any other lowercase abbreviation should be. \r\n\r\nc. 16th
    C (or c. C16) is how I would set circa 16th century.\r\n\r\n{edit Bringhurst's
