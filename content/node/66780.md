body: "The deadline for Font Aid IV submissions will be Friday, January 29th at Midnight
  Eastern Standard Time (New York).\r\n\r\nWe currently have over 250 participants
  and I expect we will exceed 300, breaking all previous Font Aid records. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re
  excited to move to the next phase in the project. Chank Diesel has been working
  hard behind the scenes to create the font. It will be sold through multiple font
  distributors. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll announce a release date as soon as we have one.
  We hope to move quickly so we can start raising funds for Haiti.\r\n\r\nThanks so
  much for your support!!\r\n\r\nMichelle & the SoTA board\r\n"
