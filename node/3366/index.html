		<div class="commentbody">Dear Mr. anony, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've been particularly annoyed with this thread  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and really didn't know how to react to it, which  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is why it's taken me so long to post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Excuse me if this may sound harsh, but this is a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->community of type designers, type users and -first  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and foremost- type lovers, and to me your request   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->betrays a lack of respect for type. To create a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->succesful type family takes talent, skill, and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->countless hours, days, months, sometimes even  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->years of hard work. If I understand it correctly,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you're just looking for a free ticket, thus depriving  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark van Bronkhorst from his livelyhood. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is not the first time this happens.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Nicolai pointed out, do you really think that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->someone who went through all that trouble would  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make the fruit of his labour available for free,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just like that. How would you feel if you didn't  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get paid for your work say the next three months  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or so? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any freeware or shareware font you're likely to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->find on the internet will most probably have design  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flaws, poor kerning, incomplete character sets,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->maybe even technical defects. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope you'll consider purchasing fonts in the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->future. The addage &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very true of freeware and share fonts. If you want  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quality type, you must be prepared to pay for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if you want to use share/freeware type: I have  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->absolutely no problems with that. But then at least  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be honest about it and don't try to masquerade it  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as genuine quality type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a very personal statement and does not in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any way represent an official viewpoint of Typophile.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK &hellip; some dissenting points. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) I certainly agree with the desire to have posters be honest about their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intentions. However, requiring every poster to show a respect for type is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just not realistic or even, IMO, reasonable. The vast majority of people out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there just don't know enough about typography to have respect for it. As a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->result, we see plenty of posts from people who ignorantly believe that one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can get a freeware/shareware font comparable to Verdigris. It seems to me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that education would be more appropriate (and effective) than scolding. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1a) This type of font request is, IMO, very different from those occasionally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seen on the MyFonts forum, where one poster actually stated, &quot;I'm not going <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to pay money for fonts!&quot;. That type of post goes well beyond ignorance and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reflects a relatively recent, largely generational attitude that it's not necessary <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to pay for fonts, music, software, etc. Those people (and they're legion) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->definitely need verbal spankings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Mr. van Bronkhorst's creations are truly splendid and he does indeed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deserve whatever price he asks. However, he rigidly offers his fonts as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->package only. Certainly there are many situations in which paying $159 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to obtain a single desired font is out of the question. I can think of two fairly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent posts here by well respected mainstays of this forum asking for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alternatives in (I believe) similar situations. I can't find those posts just now, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but I remember them verbally &quot;walking on eggshells&quot; for fear of condemnation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the case of the home hobbyist, noncommercial user or even small firm, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posters desiring a font they cannot reasonably afford have two choices: They <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can ask that someone e-mail them the font (in which case they need a verbal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whacking) or  they can seek a cheaper alternative. I see no reason why we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cannot help out the latter poster, educating them along the way. Fonts bundled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with applications (wihch the poster may even already have) can be a great option. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And most of those fonts supplied with MS apps (mostly Monotype) are of very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->high quality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, I've softened up on the ignorant free type request person. I once got one of those types to post over here. I was hoping he'd get an education. After much education (beatings), he explained his situation. Married, child in a deadend job and a cheap boss. It made me think that there are lots of poor people out there that can't afford font licences. So I now just direct them to a site like DaFont and let them discover what going through a junk yard looking for a Mercedes is like. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I strongly disagree with the &quot;junk yard&quot; analogy, as that would infer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crappy near-uselessness of the merchandise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are very many freeware/shareware fonts that are extremely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useful to a niche that I sometimes think the professional designers <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and font makers here can not relate to at all (and sometimes, dare <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I say, resent greatly). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This niche doesn't in any way NEED top quality.

This occurs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->regularly on the MyFonts forum. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The fellow wanting to make a flyer for his local club is quite willing to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->use the closest free font for his project. I submit that he shouldn't have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to phrase his request just so and show a respect for type in order to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, a better analogy, IMO, would be a car sales lot.

		<div class="commentbody">I might as well put in my two cents here too, since this is an issue I am pretty opinionated about, like many of you who have commented earlier. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I find myself most in agreement with Mike Freiman, although in the right circumstances I feel like Yves too. The difference is in the purpose or intent of the user, and unfortunately we are usually only able to take their word for it about those things.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If someone is willing to take a near-match because they can't afford the real thing for the purpose at hand, or if they are just looking for something with certain similar qualities, I think we can refer them to places where that can be found.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If they want to get the real fonts for free they can go somewhere else, and I think we ought to refer them to a special FAQ page about why that sort of question is improper, unethical and unfair (and whatever other terms Yves used above). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My 'gray area' happens when the font they want is only available as a 'clone' version, as far as we know. I will usually recommend those fonts. The FontBank fonts are a good example, because I think often the font the posters are trying to duplicate came from that collection in the first place.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am all for education, and promotion of original, quality fonts. That's why I like to credit the designers &ndash; so people realize this was someone's creative work. However, I realize, as Mike said, that there are situations when that expense can't be justified. Those are times when we should suggest alternatives, but I don't mean rip-offs of the same font. We should explain that if you aren't willing to pay for it, then you must be willing to settle for something else, but here are some things that might be similar that come with applications you may have, etc. I think it's a challenge, because most of us don't spend much time looking for cheap approximations, but if we have ideas for them, that would be the place for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The last thing we need to try to be doing is guessing at their motives, because there is no assurance that they will tell us the truth. You either want the original,and will pay for it, or you are willing to take something similar that we might suggest.</div>
