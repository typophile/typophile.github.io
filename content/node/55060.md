  website of the Society for News Design's selection of the five best-designed newspapers
  this year. In an accompanying video, one of the winners (<em>Eleftheros Tipos</em>,
  a daily published in Athens, Greece), used a clever way to fit a 2-digit numeral
  into a 1-digit space and I thought that the Typophiles would enjoy seeing it:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Newspaper

    is a D isn\u2019t it. Type dog is right, they should have found a way of making
    it fit. \r\n\r\nThe first idea that pops into my head is to crop a number ten
    into the space. That would have at least looked nice, not like a D. (just a thought)\r\n\r\nStef\r\n"

  body: "<em>@ oprion:</em> A Roman numeral in a Greek magazine? Are you trying to
    start a war?\r\n<em>@ AtoZ:</em> Joking aside, this looks like the kind of layout
    where you can break the grid a little (as they did with the big photo on the verso).
    I might have tried using a two-digit <strong>10</strong>, but taking that little
    red picture from the lower right and dropping it inside the counter of the zero."

  body: "Yes, they could have done a few things to make it fit including turning the
    10 on its side, using a subscript 0 or I particularly like oprion's idea of using
    an X. The squashed effect ruins the spacing of the whole spread (although I have
    to admit that it is legible). \r\n\r\nWorthwhile posting anyway AtoZ, well spotted.
    I'll have to remember not to try it or these lot will have my ear off!"

    that he or she liked the solution used in the newspaper. I console myself that
    those who like it probably aren't going to respond with a \"Yes, I like it too.\"
    comment.\r\n\r\nI agree that it looks like a D, but the number 1 in the list looks
    like a lower-case l -- most people can tell the difference by the context.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, there may be a more optimal solution (after all this was created for a daily
    newspaper, probably under some tight time constraints), but none of the possible
    solutions suggested so far seem any better -- they just have different problems.\r\n\r\nBut
    thanks for all the comments -- at least it's seldom boring on Typophiles.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When
