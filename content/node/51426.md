body: "I have been redesigning my logo and landed on your site when searching for
  fonts similar to Eternity. Some of the posters here turned me on to Bayer Architype,
  but I also learned that the Foundry is non-responsive to queries. [[http://typophile.com/node/1560]]
  and [[http://typophile.com/node/10870]].\r\n\r\nAll I wanted to do was test-drive
  the font to see if it was worth considering, purchasing and felt frustrated at this
  obstacle. I discovered something that may be of use to future seekers/posters and
  wanted to pay back the informational favor.\r\n\r\nThere is a .svg file posted on
  Wikipedia that has all of the Bayer Architype letterforms in outline mode. This
  provided me with a useful tool to test drive the font. I thought others might benefit
  as well. The link is: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BayerArch.svg]].\r\n\r\nI
  have decided not to use this font after all for this particular redesign so I won't
  have to chase Foundry at this point. I am still torn between Eternity and Function
  Condensed Bold but the design is evolving nicely.\r\n\r\nSo, a big thanks to those
  who posted info on Typophile forums that helped me in my quest.\r\n\r\n"
