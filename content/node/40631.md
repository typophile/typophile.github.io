  and have been searching for a font to replace [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-edwardian-script/|ITC
  Edwardian Script]] for a while now. It gets used for a lot of awards shows, but
  it doesn't hold up well on projection, especially when it's been animated in Powerpoint.\r\n\r\nSo,
  I'd like to find an elegant awards font that's legible (no small x-heights, please)
  and not excessively florid or italic or condensed. The thin strokes should be thicker
  than 1pt. \r\n\r\nI thought I had found a winner today with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/lily-wang/regular/|Lily
  Wang]] but on closer inspection, it's too \"grunge\"/rough. I may go with \r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/script-bq/medium/|Berthold
  Script Medium]] for this template to see how it flies (of course, it would still
  have to be approved by the client, so it may be back to Edwardian)\r\n\r\nAnd finally,
  the font would have to have the full character set as this awards show will also
  be in French.\r\n\r\nI know, not asking much, am I? Thanks in advance for your advice
  and suggestions!"

    Script Bold</a> might have the stroke weight to hold up, but it doesn't have a
    large x-height. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/dalliance_script/\">Dalliance
    Script</a> is far more interesting than the others, but maybe <em>too</em> interesting.\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/bold-formal-scripts/\">a
    list of formal scripts that have heavier weights</a>. Ballantines or Sloop seem
    like good candidates for your needs."
