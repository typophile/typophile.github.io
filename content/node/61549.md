body: "I'm running Fontlab with two monitors and have noticed previously that all
  windows not recognized as proper windows by Mac OSX (ie: macros, opentype, classes,
  preview) do not default back to the main monitor when the second is disconnected.
  When this happens, these windows become totally inaccessible. I have found that
  reconnecting the second monitor and manually dragging the windows back to the main
  monitor solves the problem.\r\n\r\nStill with me?\r\n\r\nRecently, a problem has
  arisen where all of these menus have become lost in monitor land. I've tried a bunch
  of things but nothing allows me to access them again. As you can imagine this is
  becoming a real problem. And no, restarting Fontlab does not fix the problem.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone encountered a similar problem? Anyone know of a fix to this issue?\r\n\r\nI
  apologize if this is vague. Trying to find a succinct way to describe this strange
  problem proved as difficult as the problem itself."

    this file will fix it. If not, some panel and window positions are in:\r\n\r\n~/Library/Preferences/com.fontlab.fontlab5.plist\r\n\r\nJust
    delete the pref file, and recreate your prefs."

  body: Set up a workspace setting for single-monitor use to invoke when this happens
    - that's what I've done.

    and built a single monitor workspace setting should the problem occur again.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
