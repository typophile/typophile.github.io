body: Let's see how good you people are at identifying a particular Blackletter typeface.
  Image is attached here. Sorry but the inline image posting does not work for me.
  A clue, the typeface has significance in being the very first Postscript Blackletter
  typeface ever made using Fontogtapher back in 1986.

    since they were among the first producers of digital fonts, and they started about
    the same time as FOG was first released. \r\n\r\n- Herb"

    Greene ads in the early Macworld magazines....

  body: It may interest some that most of the Casady&amp;Greene FLF series is available
    for free from the typOasis, apparently with permission. Mind, these are TTs, not
    T1s. Might be good enough, though, for a recapture-your-youth flip.

    body: There are a very few FLF fonts for which typOasis did not receive permission
      to post (and so they don't appear there). These include Abelard (by Judith Sutcliffe)
      and Richard Ware's Garamond family. Ware's Keycaps and his Murmansk and Glasnost
      groups weren't labeled 'FLF',  and are also omitted.
