  beauty]] (link is Wikipedia entry w/ hi-res image). It\u2019s from 1858, and the
  author is Florence Nightingale. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/splitserif_sans_5889.png]\r\nThe
  ornated split serif and grotesque\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serif_5012.png]\r\nThe
  serif\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cursive_4289.png]\r\nThe cursive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas what these might be?"

    Tuscan]] and the cursive [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kursivschrift|Kursivschrift]].\r\nFor
    the serif, looks like a Modern... Have a look to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1820-modern/|1820
    Modern]] by Gilles Le Corre (and more globally to [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/GLC/|his

    as to resemble typeset text in typefaces in current use at the time, it is entirely
    handwritten.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, 1958 is a typo for 1858."

  body: Do you think so? I first had that idea, but en I thought it might just be
    uneven printing and years of wear and tear. Edited the title, btw.
