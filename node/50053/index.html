The rebranding of <a href="http://www.bnz.co.nz">BNZ</a> by <a href="http://www.dna.co.nz">DNA Design</a> has just gone live. They're using <a href="http://www.klim.co.nz/custom_serrano.php">Serrano</a>, a custom typeface that I whipped up for them. Kiwis will see the new rebrand roll out through the country over the next few months. Your thoughts are welcome, as always.

		<div class="commentbody">Serrano looks like a clean business face that should meet the demands of your client. The italic, although a bit of a departure from the roman, has a much more friendly feel to it. This difference can be used to advantage when a dry business is trying to make an appeal to a human customer. 
When you say "whipped out" it sounds like you mean you knocked this out in a few weeks time :-)  How long did it really take?

Good crip work as usual, Kris.--best of luck with your rollout!

The characters have a friendly feel, some letter forms Resemble feijoa which may be unintentional, but is definitely a good thing! I wonder what they would look like when paired. Will this ever be available for retail? And do tell us how long this took you.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your kind words! I was briefed to design a typeface that was 'friendly, approachable, easy and helpful', so that's why it looks like it does. It will be available for retail in October 2013, they have a 5-year exclusive. I've just checked the first .vfb—it was created 24 July 2008, the final .vfb was sent for mastering on 30 August 2008. I don't know how many weeks that is, but you get the idea.

I would be interested in hearing about the relation to the bank's wordmark - its letterforms seem related to Serrano in 'feel' -; which informed the other? Was there a dialogue with the branding agency during development, and what motivated their decision to commission a new typeface? 

Kris, is 'z' your favourite letter? The italic 'z' is almost too cute ;)

I am also interested in hearing about where the wordmark, and the general branding overhaul fit into all this. 

Fantastic work on the typeface.

Poking around the site [[http://bnz.co.nz/binaries/BNZ_GDS_FINAL_Jun08.pdf|this PDF]] shows just how major of a transformation has gone on since their last branding effort.

I am very curious to see where the brand is heading visually with similar design challenges, as they have lost a great deal of the sternness and heritage evoked by the previous mark.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys! I was waiting for the Strada comparison… I had a mini panic attack at one stage when I realised that Serrano was looking close to Strada, so I asked Erik Spiekermann for advice & he said it wasn't close enough to worry. The rounded terminals are actually suggestion from the AD after an early proof. At that stage there were no rounded bits—just normal square terminals. He suggested rounding on the uprights: 


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serrano-feedback-02_4134.gif]


and curving the 't' tail to a point:


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serrano-feedback-01_4462.gif]


I responded with a new draft with the suggested upright treatments and additional rounded-to-a-point terminals on a,c,e,f,g,j,l,r,s,t—as it would look weird just having it on the 't'. The AD/client liked it & that was that! 

As for the logotypes, they were drawn in-house & sent to me to polish. I'm not sure at what point they were started or what the references were, but they are a bit different from Serrano. I'm not entirely sure what motivated them to commission a custom face, perhaps they weren't entirely happy with anything currently available for retail?

		<div class="commentbody">Greetings All,
I came across this website while trawling the net for some help with a graphics problem. I am an engineer who knows as much about graphic design as my arse knows about snipe shooting. However I must create a stylised logo for an earthmoving bucket product range. The company name is Venco (how inspiring is that?) I had hoped to do something around the letter V. That’s where the inspiration dried up! Can any of you brainy guys kick me in the right direction. PS I am based in Africa and graphics agencies are not quite ten a penny. Thanks in advance.

You really have a talent for getting a feel for your clients are looking for.  And given that you've created typefaces that lean slightly more toward the warm & friendly side (Feijoa, National, Hardys), it is remarkable that you can create Serrano and still not make it look like these others.

Congratulations! and much success to you!

Still, to me the terminals seem to me a little tacked on, not as organic as with your other faces. Also I find the tops of the BDR a bit awkward. As to alternatives, I think the way Myriad takes Frutiger and tapers the terminals is very systematically worked out, and is quite effective, even though I think Frutiger is a more beautiful face. A more soft, swashy treatment of terminals that works is in Goudy sans, but it's too busy and informal for a bank. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I quite like the terminals. I don't think it is a requirement to follow existing methods used in long-accepted faces--particularly when the point of a custom face is to create brand separation. This is a contemporary sans that takes on the task of setting a brand-specific tone. I think the terminals go to that aim quite well along with the rest of the structure.

I've been suppressing this comment for a few days because I don't want it to come off as a slight in any way and it will use a VERY BAD word in reference to your work. You once asked me what it was that I thought characterized your style and after seeing Serrano, it finally gelled in my mind. To me, your work is a combination of Classic (so far so good) and Cute. There, I said it. Of course this design is meant to be friendly, but I think that's part of your aesthetic in general. I think all of your work (that I've seen) follows this Classic+Cute formula, with the exception of NZ Rugby Chisel. I mean all of this in the best possible way. I for one am a fan of your work and as you can see by this post, I'm not alone, so the formula's working. Mostly I just wanted to come back to the conversation we had months ago and fill in the blank. Keep up the good work! Oh and hello from Catherine Griffiths, she dropped by the DaMa offices the other day and we got to meet her and she raved about you. :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, this is reminiscent of David Berlow's comment in Robert Norton's TBR/TBF in the middle of an ITC selection committee meeting that he doesn't like Stone Sans italic and similar. (Something to do with masculine/feminine terminations which I never figured out.) 

I like your formulation of Classic+Cute -- which is acute (which is the original meaning of cute). The problem with a corporate typeface is that it must be noticed and must be liked, but must never waver in its credibility. This is very tough to do. A great corporate typeface must also have Zeitgeist awareness. The feeling that this design belongs here, now, I like it now and I will like it for ten years, if not forever. Very few type designers have the ability to connect with and exploit the visual language of their moment - - it is such a very subtle thing. It's very easy to lose, and for the few who succeed, the achievement seldom carries over beyond a generation.

Cute is an interesting word in that it has simultaneous good and bad connotations, unlike for example 'naff' which can mean one of two opposite things (not invariably discoverable by context) but not both together. One could think of cute as having a possible axis with ego as one extreme and humour as another. 

In a recent thread criticizing the Vista C-fonts, I used cute primarily negatively. There, the design goal was to prepare several typefaces suitable for everyday, every-hour use, to be used by hundreds of millions of users. All-day, all-weather use. Crystal goblet design. In this I think they failed, except for the user base which happily cohabits with the most famous C-font of all, Comic Sans. However, any of the C-fonts would be considered superb candidates for a corporate identity or advertising project. 

By contrast we're using cute here in its happiest senses. This is a happy typeface. That is one of the very hardest things to do. I don't care how it happens, as long as it happens. 

Speaking of the how, two people have noted a resemblance between Serrano and Foco (including its primary designer, Fabio Maag). Based on the web samples available, I just don't see it at all, and I am something of an expert on what constitutes type cloning. If someone is going to make this case, I think they should make it in good, high, resolution. Don't say something looks like something unless you're willing to prove it. (I could just as well say that Foco looks like a sans version of the Vafflard font I have been working on for the past 15 years. It does! Shame! The f and t without the left bar are mine! Forever!) However, in this particular case, having spent some careful time with the web samples, and even allowing for the low res, I must say they look like completely different designs to me. The suggestion of influence should not have been made.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess I agree with Paul about the 'cute' part about this design, but not about Kris's designs in general, where I would say 'beautiful'. 

In looking again at it, I'm thinking that what bothers me is not so much the terminals themselves, as their combination with the slight reversed contrast, the Bloemsma influence. A more assertive design that Kris did--I think it was called Karbon--made the Bloemsma influence work well. But here the softness of the terminals for me don't go well with the heavy looking strokes. For example, in the 'a', the top stroke is quite heavy--like Gill sans. But then comes the soft, tapered stroke which to me contradicts it. By contrast, if you look at the soft terminal at the bottom of the 'g', which has a thinner stroke, the effect is lovely. 

Also, I wonder whether it would look better with a rounded inner corner rather than outer corner in the stems of the m n r. And why have horizontal cuts terminating the 'w' when all the other verticals end in soft terminals? I just keep getting the feeling that a more formal design had a bow stuck on it. Very well drawn, but disconcerting to me. 

I am here looking at the bold, as this stuff is not noticeable in the lighter weight in the link to Kris's site.

Gee, can I see that? (I couldn't find on the web).

I started Foco from sketch in a workshop Bruno Maag did about 8 years ago. A few years after the workshop I finished my version of it and DaMa got interest. So they fine tune it to their high standard and it was released in 2006.

		<div class="commentbody">I just saw the link to Foco (sorry). And thanks for the nice comparison, Fabio. I have to think that the similarity ends with those characteristic terminals. In essence the two are nothing alike.

Concerning Dan's candid and incisive insight: I do see it, but Kris is just starting. If he gets stuck on one style, that's a problem. But I see him moving on, with confidence, as needed. That said, some people never move on from a style they're comfortable with and still contribute a great deal to the craft. As an example, some people (including Bill, IIRC) see persistent cuteness in the work of Unger, but we know how <em>that</em> turned out!

		<div class="commentbody">Fabio, thanks for the illustration. I now see some more of the similarities, and also more of the differences. I can better see why William is bothered by the terminals, but honestly, whereas I wouldn't want to use the font myself, I would love for my bank to use it -- and that's the whole purpose here. Fabio's design has a completely different flavour and feeling. Fabio, I wasn't serious about that Vafflard remark. Vafflard was the first (about 1783) to take the left bars off f and t, and I was the first to start reviving Vafflard's designs quite some years ago without however ever having released any of the work. (Interestingly, one of my quarrels with Adobe, when they took this work on, was that they decided halfway through that they wanted left bars put on. Matthew Carter and Sumner Stone, whom I consulted about this lunacy, professed themselves quite unable to understand it. That it was an issue at all illustrates my commitment to the barless f and t in this design. I gave in to them in the end -- what choice did I have? -- but that wasn't enough to save the project, which remains unreleased though occasionally used. A typophile thread where the font is illustrated is http://typophile.com/node/47453. You can see why Robert didn't want it released before Garamond Premier and some of his other later fonts, which incorporate many curiously similar ideas.)

Hrant, will you remind me what I said about Unger and cuteness and how it turned out? I don't remember any of this. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">To get back on topic, I think Fabio's terminal treatment is more likely to work best at smaller sizes and I love anyone willing to take on the challenges of the left-bar-less f and t. (I am remembering Slimbach and Twombley's incomparable performance in this respect. 'Week 1. We think you should have a little blob, the teeniest thing, just two or three units, to the left of f and t. Week 2. Do you think you could shape the blobs a bit more? Just a couple of extra points? Week 3. We don't think two or three units is enough. Could you try five or six? Week 4. The blob shape isn't working for us, do you think you could make it more like a bar? Week 5. We know we asked you only for a tiny bar, just ten units, but do you think you could extend it just a tad to thirteen or fourteen? Week 6. Let's have the bar come out fully. We think that will give the characters better balance. Don't worry, Bill, it's just a blob. Nobody will notice it.' Oh, did I say I say I was going to stay on-topic?)

I enjoyed also Kris's article about Balance. I am more convinced by Bloemsma's curve theories than by his stress theories and I am glad Kris didn't overdo the stress.

I realize that Kris's approach to the terminals isn't entirely consistent, but it really works for me in sizes large enough to be visible. I think I know why: What is so <em>acute</em> about this treatment is that it states, through the simplest graphic elements, a strong message: innovation and modernity (C), plus tradition and stability (u). This is an utterly brilliant use of graphical elements to send a signal that will be recognized by everyone who has ever seen a conventional typeface in use. I really admire the intelligence and instinct at work here. William, surely, in these terms, you can see why he has done exactly what he did. I cannot think of another typeface where this has been done so successfully. It succeeds on so many different levels: visual, psychological, aesthetic. An exceptionally sophisticated command of contemporary marketing and advertising language is seen here at its clearest, its most elemental. I don't think I'm overstating the case when I say that we all can learn a lot from this typeface.</div>

I am not convinced by either. By 'curve theories' I take it you mean his quote from a teacher, "a straight line is a dead line." I think this is sometimes true, enough to make it a good quote. But it is also sometimes false. Straight verticals, for example, convey strength in some designs. The straights are also often combined with curves, and the tension is very lively, and not dead. 

As opposed to the 'sometimes true' view about straight lines, I just don't like the reversed contrast thing with roman. The "heavy vertical, lighter horizontal" rule is so deep in the DNA of the Imperial caps and Carolingian minuscule that I just don't think the reversal works. Hebrew is the other way around, and there the heavy horzontal, light vertical rule works fine--but the shapes are fundamentally different. Also the Roman Rustica caps are reversed contrast, but again have a different skeleton. When you take classic upper and lower case 'bones' and try to put reversed-contrast clothing on them, it always looks ill-fitting to my eyes.  </div>

4) In terms of "how it turned out", I just mean that Unger has been a superb contributor (as I think you agree) irrespective of any persistent theme (cuteness or otherwise) throughout his work.

> I am more convinced by Bloemsma’s curve theories than by his stress theories

Well, his stress theories evolved rapidly and markedly even starting from Avance, and certainly by Legato. In the end (which came so soon) Bloemsma didn't see reverse contrast as anything central (if he ever did). He was slowly coming around to the practical benefits of (so-called) stroke contrast, serifs, etc., although absolutely not in terms of chirography, quite the contrary.

I agree. And honesty too.

This makes no sense to me. There is nothing comparable to DNA here. And really, even DNA mutates!  :-)

This skeleton business has to go. Leave them in the closet, then burn the closet. We don't read skeletons; it's just an intellectually lethargic way to make fonts. And any differences are not "fundamental", but malleable; which is not to say we should change things in cavalier or chauvinistic fashion. But if something <em>needs</em> change, we should try.

		<div class="commentbody">I did a project for a corporate client a few years ago which bears some similarity. This kind of work is more styling than design. Nothing wrong with that, it's the kind of font development the situation calls for. Smoothing some of the corners is a quite literal (though somewhat simplistic) interpretation of the brief for something "friendly", that can be pointed to, easily understood, and signed off on by various levels of client. Art directors contribute by deciding where, and in which direction, the go-faster streamlining goes. 

There is rarely enough time to do a thorough job from scratch, so it's expedient to whip up a font solution by taking something basic off the shelf and applying a little tinkering. Indiscriminately rounding some of the corners is one technique that does the job, as is chopping some of the perpendicular terminals off at angles. Voilà--a new custom typeface!

True. What I was trying to get at was the apparent lack of rationale for where the round corners go. Sure, one can discriminatingly place them here and there so that the overall effect in text is comfortable, but is that all there is?

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, thanks for all the interesting feedback! I'm not too sure how to respond to the classic/cute description, people will see what they will. I always thought it was more 'humanist', in the looser sense of the word.  

<em>In looking again at it, I’m thinking that what bothers me is not so much the terminals themselves, as their combination with the slight reversed contrast, the Bloemsma influence.</em>

I'm not seeing the reversed contrast, there isn't any in there. Serrano has a fairly standard contrast. Where are you seeing it?

<em>Smoothing some of the corners is a quite literal (though somewhat simplistic) interpretation of the brief for something “friendly”, that can be pointed to, easily understood, and signed off on by various levels of client. </em>

You could say it was literal & simplistic, or you could say it was quite appropriate to the brief. There were three other typefaces that they were using for a reference & a starting point. All of them had rounded corners and only one was well-made enough to actually use. I was unwilling to do the 'rounded corner' thing, as it would date too quickly (web 2.0 etc). 

<em>There is rarely enough time to do a thorough job from scratch, so it’s expedient to whip up a font solution by taking something basic off the shelf and applying a little tinkering.</em>

Are you insinuating that this isn't a thorough, from-scratch job? 

<em>True. What I was trying to get at was the apparent lack of rationale for where the round corners go. Sure, one can discriminatingly place them here and there so that the overall effect in text is comfortable, but is that all there is?</em>

Let me be very clear. The rounded bits are not just slapped on here & there to make it 'friendly'. The 'humanist' structure (like Thesis Sans) the open, generous counters (like Frutiger) and the overall narrow set are purposefully designed to convey the desired qualities. I have rounded ascenders, but not on the horizontals or the capital uprights—as these start to look too weird & cutesy (haha) for a bank. All of the curve-to-a-point terminals are applied to curved terminals only, like a,c,e,s,f,t, etc.

Yes, I said it was literal, simplistic, and appropriate.

<em>Are you insinuating that this isn’t a thorough, from-scratch job?</em>

I'm not insinuating. I'm offering my thoughts (as you requested) as to how the mechanics of the working relationship between a foundry, the foundry's client, and the client's client affect the design of a custom type. I'd be interested in your insights, rather than just a straight assertion of how perfectly the design delivers on the brief. 

Whether or not you drew it completely from scratch, or modified another of your designs, is not the issue. There is certainly nothing unprofessional about modifying one's own work to produce new designs; at the same time, drawing completely from scratch is no guarantee of quality. Conceptually, the wine typeface you showed here recently is more thoroughly original.

<em>The rounded bits are not just slapped on here & there to make it ’friendly’.</em>

They aren't? You have said that your client started you off with three rounded types--surely the metaphor that a rounded styling is friendly (not to mention fashionable) is central to the typographic ethos of this project? However, you were, understandably, unwilling to remain at that superficial level, seeking a richer implementation of the desired qualities, with the "humanist" features and proportions that you gave to the face. Nonetheless, the application of rounded corners wherever they don't look too cutsey does seem to be a compromise. Despite your explanation of a system, there still seems to be a certain arbitrariness in the application of round corners. Why, for instance, is the top left of "u" sharp, but not the top left of "n"? Why no rounded corners in "w"?

There's absolutely nothing wrong with making styling decisions with a discriminating eye, in fact, it polishes faces to perfection. But conceptually, when a client specifies not just a brief of abstract qualities, but an execution such as a rounded finish, how can that free the designer to do a completely thorough, from scratch, job?

It certainly can be an issue, and I would say generally is, since a "custom" solution does mean something special to the client. Even if a client is not knowledgeable about type, he will feel cheated if the font they paid a lot of money for is based on an existing one. On the other hand, if one tells the client this is what will be happening (as I've done recently for a client in Armenia) then it's OK.

Nick, know that this was not the tone of your previous message.

You don't know that. Even if you or I think it's friendly, that doesn't mean the client thought so.

> how can that free the designer to do a completely thorough, from scratch, job?

Of course, nothing is completely from scratch. Duh.

Look again. I'm situating the discussion in terms of the professional process.

<em>You don’t know that. Even if you or I think it’s friendly, that doesn’t mean the client thought so.</em>

That's why I'm asking Kris, "Surely....?
From my perspective, the equation of rounded type with friendliness is pretty obvious.

<em>Of course, nothing is completely from scratch. Duh.</em>

Of course it is. If your brief consists of abstract qualities, then the conceptualization is entirely up to you; and if you draw all your characters (no tracing or re-using exisiting paths), that's from scratch. Duh.

I don't 'get' the illustration with Bookman; it seems to me totally different than Serrano. As to the treatment on the other verticals of the lower case, if you compare Meta, for example, on this there is not just horizontal sheers, but different treatment to go with the bent stem tops on the mnr.

I suspect the comments re. 'reversed contrast' are in response to the strong x-height and baseline horizontals and the correspondingly reduced weight in the mid-zone in the frequent letters a e and s, most notable in the heavier weight. You're right, Kris, this isn't 'reversed contrast', but I can see how this kind of weight manipulation might remind people of Evert's Balance. What Serrano actually has is Jean François Porchez-style <em>’orizontalité.</em> Very nice, too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am not sure the problem is that these matters are subjective. Describing or comparing visual features of typefaces, their roundness, edgyness etc, is part of our job, whether explicitly done or not. My problem is with describing type as "cute", "friendly", "beautiful". What we associate with a typeface is what happens in our's minds but is nothing found on paper as such. We better stick to describing what we see, like "rounded" (Nick) or "curve-to-a-point terminals"* (Kris) -- and <em>then</em>, maybe, if we feel like it, utter what we associate with this.

* Finally I have a term for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)

Trying to make sense of what has been said: Maybe the issue is that quite a few typefaces use a curve-vs-corner trick so they look either <em>a bit</em> rounded or <em>less</em> rounded. 1. With curve-to-a-point terminals -- especially Underware's work (Dolly, Sauna) stimulated others to adopt this feature. 2. With point-in-curve counter, a corner inside "e" or "o" counters -- that's the opposite, to make it look <em>less</em> round, part of the Reading house-style. Both found in sanserif and serif typefaces alike. In so far it's not a "just slapped on" issue (using Kris' term, cannot find who brought this up), but that curve-to-a-point or point-in-curve appear as just two ingredients that can be switched on/off with virtually every kind of typeface -- 1. like "e" or "c" curve-to-a-point terminals in very different styles like Serrano or Omnes or seriffed Sauna, and 2. there was an entire Typophile thread dedicated to typefaces with point-in-curve counters (cannot find it now).</div>

I talked further with Kris about this and it's so hard to describe what you are seeing that what you are feeling is sometimes easier (and maybe clearer, even if less precise). It's not the terminal treatments that make this work 'cute', it's the handling of all of the curves: they're all a bit over-plump you might say (or tend towards the super-ellipse if you want more techy terminology). It's this feature that makes all of Kris' work 'friendly', IMO. To me it's this feature that really sets Seranno and Foco apart: despite the rounded terminals of Foco, it feels more 'neutral' (throw me a more techinical term for that!) to me because the handling of the curves is different (to my eyes at least).

terminology is such a tricky thing, really. even seemingly universal terms such as 'yellow' are cultural constructs and mean different things to different people. To me it's obvious that Kris' concept of a 'curve' is different from my own.</div>

Well, judge for yourself: http://www.typefacedesign.org
I can see what Karsten means: most diversely implemented – for instance – in Paul Hunt’s <a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2008/PaulHunt_GrandiaGandhara_specimen.pdf">Grandia</a>, Rob Keller’s <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/type-design/vesper-preview/">Vesper</a>, Fermello’s <a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2007/FernandoMello_Frida_specimen.pdf">Frida</a> … Jelmar Geertsma <a href="http://typophile.com/node/37075">digs that kind of counters</a>, too.

Then again, this preference is not limited to Reading, of course. Jarno Lukkarila’s <a href="http://www.jarnolukkarila.com/template.php?yksikko=format_design&sivu=about&alasivu=about_xtra_sans&alasivu_taso_2=neo-gothic_construction&lang=en">Xtra Sans</a> is a prime example for the <cite>point-in-curve counter</cite> – and he studied at [[KABK]].

Again, as near as I can judge, the Serrano implementation is superb in a way that is still extremely rare today. By implementation I mean primarily truly excellent fitting and other factors that make the typeface harmonious, usable, and useful. For example, I am crazy about Paul's Grandia typeface, which shows such deep understanding of the intangibles of serious reading, but I don't think the fitting is there yet based on the sample referenced here. Great fitting is a skill few great type designers have, and ideally would not have to worry about. Nick, I love your type but Richler proved you were not very comfortable with text fitting, remember? Part of what I am trying to say is that one of the reasons why Kris's decisions to treat this element (n) one way and that element (u) another way is <em>not</em> important is that the overall appearance of the set typeface is so overwhelmingly convincing. No doubt Serrano is open to criticism, but I have not yet heard a pertinent criticism expressed yet. As for prediction that

Sure. Five years to be exact (the duration of the exclusivity). But that doesn't mean Nick isn't right about it being too "friendly" -hence not sober enough- for these times (through no fault of Kris, since that's what the client asked for - although maybe DNAD should have said something, early on). The age of the straight line might be coming back, which is a shame, since that would seem to preclude organicity, which is just now taking flight for real (and I like it a lot).

		<div class="commentbody"><em>I’m offering my thoughts (as you requested) as to how the mechanics of the working relationship between a foundry, the foundry’s client, and the client’s client affect the design of a custom type. I’d be interested in your insights, rather than just a straight assertion of how perfectly the design delivers on the brief.</em>

The mechanics are pretty straight forward. They came to me wanting a custom typeface to fit into their new branding direction. I looked at what they had graphic design wise, their mood boards, which typefaces they were referencing & talked to the AD about what was good & bad about those typefaces. Once I had a clear idea of what they needed I started drawing (yes, from a blank slate). The design was sent through at various stages to get feedback & sign-off, all the way until it was finished. Isn't this how everyone does it? 

<em>Nonetheless, the application of rounded corners wherever they don’t look too cutsey does seem to be a compromise. Despite your explanation of a system, there still seems to be a certain arbitrariness in the application of round corners. Why, for instance, is the top left of “u” sharp, but not the top left of “n”? Why no rounded corners in “w”?</em>

I put the curves in where it made visual sense to me. Any more would have ruined it. I tried rounded bits on the 'u' and 'w' but they looked wrong. If that is arbitrary, then so be it! 


<em>But conceptually, when a client specifies not just a brief of abstract qualities, but an execution such as a rounded finish, how can that free the designer to do a completely thorough, from scratch, job?</em>

I'm not sure I understand why this is relevant. I'm a designer, not an artist. I want and need their feedback and input to make a typeface suitable for them. They initially wanted rounded corners, like Unit Rounded. I didn't do that, but we arrived at the rounded-to-a-point curve mutually during the collaborative design process. I think that client involvement makes a thorough job.

<em>On the “slightly reversed contrast” I meant as I said the a, which goes from relatively thick to the reduced, curved terminal…</em>

Ah. I thought you meant I had gone totally Antique Olive/Balance! Maybe one day, for something else.

<em>What Serrano actually has is Jean François Porchez-style ’orizontalité.</em>

What a lovely term for it!

<em>I’ll take a bet that this one will stick with Kris’s identity for some time to come.</em>

Hey Bill, just to clarify that the identity isn't mine, only the typeface. I'd hate to take credit where it's not due…

Concerning the "in competition with Matthew Carter" bit, if we're talking about commercial competition* then quite sadly, as Mrs Eaves has shown so well, good spacing doesn't necessarily matter much. It's been the best-selling Emigre font (and that's saying a lot) even though Robin Kinross has equated it with a loose bicycle (while I've equated it with a high attractive women with a severe speech impediment).

* As opposed to critical competition, which is not something Nick (or Matthew, who is however too modest to do so anyway) should present an opinion about, leaving it to others to determine.

Paul, I most certainly hope you're right.

(Strangely this did not occur to Zapf whose competently fitted Melior is the ultimate parent of this typeface -- not that Melior should be encouraged to breed.) Another global problem is that the caps are incorrectly fitted in relation to the lowercase, leading to the excessive gaps between uppercase letters followed by lowercase letters. Look at commissioned, where mmi is reasonable but co is too loose, om is looser still, and the snobbish e has erected a hedge to shield its unwelcome neighbours from view.

I don't agree. Getting good rhythm and color is important to readability, and so readability is a constraint on text faces that does make for "right" and "wrong". This is probably a range rather than a bright line, though.

Innovation is not, per se, incorrect. Of course, the sidebearings of Richler don't look right when one examines them closely and looks for divergence from standard theory and practice. In fact, I had to overcome my prejudices and concentrate on how the face reads in text, to fully commit to the concept.

Ultimately, "fit" is not a matter of right or wrong. Like other aspects of type design, it's more a question of style and tone, and the personal discrimination of the designer. There are different styles of fit, and Richler is wide and open, whether you like it or not.

The face hasn't been used much, due to the exclusive conditions of the licence, but if you'd care to see it in its intended context, you might enjoy this--and learn something:

It seems to go even further. For example, the left side of the "b" would be spaced the same as the left of the "h", right? Basically it sounds like it's aiming for uniform spacing of the main verticals, ignoring lesser parts of glyphs.

When it comes to text, I can't agree. There's a relationship between a font's vertical proportions, color and spacing, and Mrs Eaves has to either be a lot tighter (to work at around 14 point) or darker, larger on the body & a bit tighter (to work at smaller sizes). For display work though I can see its airiness being aesthetically useful.

BTW, who are these re-designers? Is it legal?

> refitting the commercial font would be impossible

Not impossible, just annoying to a minority of users who for some rarified reason have to go back and reset a large work with the new version. Plus those people could just have both versions on hand.

BTW, do I actually remember correctly that Emigre eventually -and quietly- released an updated version (I mean after the OT one) with the spacing fixed? (Maybe it was a dream I had...)

> there are people who are simply too invested

This is the real problem.
Artistes.

BTW, to those of you who are weary of the chronic Mrs Eaves bashing and/or fearful of yet another flame war sparked by the bashing, understand that the bashing happens because of Mrs Eaves's combination of commercial success and poor craft. This combination unnerves some of us, because it makes us feel like all our attention to detail goes ignored by most graphic designers. And it does. But we have to remember why we really do apportion this attention.

That doesn't mean they're using different <em>philosophies</em> of spacing. Plus some designers -like Paul in this very thread- are modest enough to admit they are not Perfect.

What I mean is that the designer should not apportion metrics primarily by examining large images of glyphs in the metrics window of FontLab, but by reading paragraphs of text printed out at book text size.

<em>That’s art talk, not design talk.</em>

Even though they may adhere to the same philosophy, can't type designers have personal style in implementing it?
Doesn't one type designer "fit" differently than another?
Slimbach and Licko, for instance, are at different ends of the tight/loose spectrum.
But why should there be only one acceptable philosophy of fit?</div>

I agree with William. <strong>Good rhythm is consistantcy in color.</strong> There should not be strips of white space between the letters or words due to the shapes of the sides of the letters. This is where good kerning comes into play, as certain letter pairs need to be closer together, whiles others need to be further apart.

Generally speaking, larger type is tighter to a fault, and smaller type is looser. Text faces for children are a little looser even at medium sizes, or the typeface design is very wide, like Schoolbook.

In a well-made OpenType font, kerning becomes obsolete, or is only used as an override, like in InDesign diacritics panel (I assume the non-ME regular version has this pallete). 

I wonder if the leading OpenTpe font-makers are adding this extra feature. David Berlow of FontBureau, is this the case with your fonts? Thomas Pinney of Adobe, co-makers of OpenType, is this feature in your fonts? Is Linotype still around?</div>

I think the problem is if you substitute a 'system' for the eye, which is I fear what Nick did with this one type face. But I would need to see it in text before judging. 

Both Kern Master and iKern are reputed to do a pretty good job. That tells me that there is a lot of constraint on how much variation you can do, and still have it work well for small, extended text. In fact the constraint can be done as an algorithm, to a great extent. That tells me that the eye has pretty strict demands on what is successful in text. 

>visual physics and balancing forces inherent in the font   

But that is exactly what makes a font readable, Chris. If it were just personal expression, you could say to hell with balance. But you won't end up with a successful text face.</div>

Each designer uses his or her own set of visual measurements and ratios to find an answer. There have been both successes and failures in fitting using any methods available. Perhaps it is not the system one uses but the quality of execution one arrives at?

Yes. There are four basic questions to answer: how do you space H, O, n, o ? Everything follows from that. So: you have four dependent parameters: cap straights, cap rounds, lc straights, lc rounds. (Not that these do not have variations. For example, left b will sometimes be substantially less than left l. And it can happen, not seldom in a 'Modern', that what is right for n is not right for m.) 

The problem is that we look at these parameters as independent, when they are all dependent. Richler is a textbook example of this situation: the lc straights are a little loose, but the lc rounds are very, very loose. And the caps don't relate to either.

Nick, if you can't see the disharmony of the Richler spacing, it's time to take a fresh look. Don't you want to be remembered for your successes rather than your failures, interesting and educative as they may be? 

Needless to say, spacing is only, ever, optimal at one point size. You hope, in a single master type, to have designed that optimal size such that positive tracking can take care of the smaller sizes and negative tracking can take care of the larger sizes. Or you design other sizes with different spacing. Or you tell your single master customers that they should only use the type at once size.

There is no one right way, but just because that is true, it doesn't make a wrong way a right way. For example, o spacing in relation to n spacing is typically looser in Lino metal (and photo/digital); tighter in Mono metal, and tighter still in ATF metal. (Benton liked tight o's.) Matthew Carter has suggested that one reason for this progression may simply have to do with the comparative fragility of the type in the three systems. However that may be, Sumner Stone for example prefers looser o's in relation to n's than Carter does.

Whatever way you solve the relationships, you must do so plausibly, without obvious rivers of space running through a single word. Like 'commission' in the Richler pdf where it will be obvious even to an un-typographically sophisticated reader that something is amiss. Look at 'personality'. lity is nicely spaced. But everything else is too loose, and the p looks as if it weren't even attached to the word.

I suspect there may be more subtle problems, too. Look at full. ll is very nice, but I would guess that u has the same right sidebearing as l. It needs less, because it is only at x-height. It's a pity, because the typeface could really sing with good fitting! </div>

From my own experience I have a hunch that this might be due -at least in part- to the relative importance one gives to control-string spacing versus real-language spacing. If you rely too much on control-string spacing, the round-straight sequence (and by extension the overall) becomes too loose when you actually set text. One solution is to set round sidebearings tight, then gently kern the round-rounds positively. This is what I did in Harrier, and people seem to think highly of its spacing.

There is nothing wrong with the type's metrics.
Certainly, it looks strange when examined closely (as if it were a headline), but that's not how one reads a book, is it?

That's fantastic, Hrant. You independently discovered one of the cornerstones of Berthold's spacing system: tight o's eliminate problems with caps and diagonals, and all possible o-o shapes have 10 or 20 units of positive kerning. If you subtract the cap-to-cap positive kerning, it's a fairly simple system.

		<div class="commentbody">>One solution is to set round sidebearings tight, then gently kern the round-rounds positively. 

I always do this and even more so with caps. My biggest "discovery" (probably old hat to others but...) was to give up on Capital spacing feature and instead, space the caps purely with the lowercase then kern the caps to each other with positive kerning. This eliminates the unified application of space between all kinds of pairs and allows a more sensible approach. It only takes a couple of class-kerning pairs to work. The biggest factor is adding space between straight sidebearings with a chunk of positive kerning. It also lessens the issue with matching diagonals like A and V with straights like H and N.

In OpenType, I can create a way each kind of character pair should be distanced from each other, and store it in the font. This is character-based kerning. Not in the application but in the font.

Why do you think it doesn't do away with kerning?

> <cite>What feature are you talking about? You can’t mean the glyph palette, it is part of the application software.</cite>

The glyph palette only selects a letter at a time. Even if OpenType is selected in the Diacritics palette, no kerning-like feature results, if the OpenType font was hastily made.

As Paul Nelson, formerly the head of Microsoft Typography said: "OpenType is [then] just a wrapper for a cross platform TrueType font."

A "true" OpenType font can do much much more.</div>

Sorry, let me try again. I am not talking about "personal philosophy" at all, but what is really going on when people read--that some fonts are better for text than others, and this has partly to do with spacing. Are we in agreement about that? Or are you making another point?  

I am of course in agreement that the successful spacing depends on the individual letter shapes, and how they relate to others. 

Israel, I guess I am not understanding you either. Are you referring to using Open Type features for kerning rather than "flat" kerning? That's not doing away with kerning, its just using a different means to kern, right? </div>

Another option is to give v's and w's negative widebearings (which would be considered kerning in metal type!), as in Georgia, for instance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, to answer your question about Berthold kerning, the other primary feature, and the one that takes up the most space, is positive cap-to-cap kerning. However, the purpose of this is not to fix errors that could have occurred because of incorrect relationships with the lowercase or with itself. The purpose is to guarantee, by default, well-spaced (near "letterspaced") caps in all-cap settings. I don't actually think it's a good system, though no less an authority than Erik Spiekermann is very much in favour of it. I think what Matthew Carter has worked out in his later work (the past ten or fifteen years) is just about the best. It is much more sophisticated, and not always easy to understand, but I always find that his fonts have the answer to any question I encounter. And I always have plenty, because I am not one of nature's fitters, and always find it a trial. 

>BTW, who are these re-designers? Is it legal?

No names! Under Adobe's rules, it would be legal, provided that the user had a license to the font. With Emigre I wouldn't like to say, except that a lot of use of the fonts would not take place without this treatment, and they don't seem to have sued anyone over it - - it would look so silly. How can you sue someone for repairing basic defects in your product? </div>
