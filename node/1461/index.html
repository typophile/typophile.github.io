		<div class="commentbody">Jay and everyone &ndash; Let's just have the discussion in here. I can tell that it will be difficult to just post lists without actually saying anything. I had that problem myself. <BR> <BR>Another thing, let's keep names out of this if it involves a personal negative slant. Meaning a person, not a company. My point is not to create a witch list. <BR> <BR>I had one foundry owner actually tell me at ATypI, that students shouldn't be held responsible, but that they should simply start buying type, and owning their type, once they begin in the professional world. <BR> <BR>However, could I ask within your posts that you <b>make bold</b> the main points (or list items).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe the letterror guys could build a font that self-destructs when you get your diploma. That's not too much to ask, is it? <BR> <BR>Today's student is tomorrow's font customer. But I agree - more emphasis needs to be placed on owning the fonts you use. Ultimately it's in the hands of the University to drive this point home. Foundries can't be expected to give out free student licenses, but have there been any success stories around <b>student licenses with reduced pricing/limited-use EULAs?</b> <BR> <BR>Another issue to add to the type education of students: <b>Understanding the relationship between a font license and the # of computers it can be legally installed to.</b> Many professionals are fuzzy on this as well.</div>

Reflect the &quot;a&quot;, rotate the &quot;e&quot;, etc&hellip; IOW, create fonts that are perfectly usable for the teaching of typography, but not usable in a professional setting.

		<div class="commentbody">An interesting idea, but one that I fear might not fly - as students are using the type to create portfolio projects, which eventually end up in front of a potential employer when they're fresh out of school. As a student, I'd prefer to do the typo-flipping myself, if it supported whatever typographic concept I was designing. <BR> <BR>I like the idea of watermarking, though. But what's the appropriate way to go about it?  <BR> <BR>Most of the issue boils down to educators pushing the ethics of using fonts. I can't remember who said that every design student should be required to design &amp; build one font before graduating - that will teach them to think twice before pirating fonts.  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany &ndash; <BR> <BR>I'm still trying to get my thoughts into bullet points. Here's what I have so far: <BR> <BR><b>Education (a):</b> I love the plaintive cries of the people sued by the RIAA:&quot;I paid for Kazaa, how can using it be illegal?&quot; Do people actually understand that &quot;sharing&quot; fonts is illegal? <BR> <BR><b>Education (b):</b> If most people can't (or don't bother to) make their tenses agree in their writing, how can they be expected to care about proper typography? &quot;What's wrong with Ariel?&quot; Getting people to care about the essential role of good typography in written communication is necessary before you can get them to care about the value (therefor ownership) of fonts. <BR> <BR><b>Carrot:</b> It'd be really nice if people would stop stealing fonts, but what do we offer as an incentive? Warm fuzzies are great in Church or around a camp-fire, but I don't know that you can use them to motivate people in the real world. Teaching ethics is essential, but I also think there needs to be a tangible reward for complying w/ IP laws (i.e. actually purchasing fonts vs. &quot;borrowing&quot; them). <BR> <BR><b>Stick:</b> Let's face it, if you know you aren't going to get caught, are you going to steal candy from the unguarded candy jar? Especially if it's a magic candy jar, that automatically re-fills each time a piece of candy is removed? I think the RIAA went <i>way</i> over the top &hellip; but if they hadn't gone that far, would they have gotten so much ink? There needs to be some realistic possibility of getting caught if IP laws are going to have any effect. <BR> <BR>   -/-/- <BR> <BR>I keep going back to Bringhurst's comment in his AtypI keynote speech:&quot;&hellip;software in its natural state is invisible.&quot; The task is to convince font users that something invisible has value. If something has no value, how can it be stolen? <BR> <BR></div>

My name is Tiffany Wardle and I am a Typoholic. <BR> <BR>&mdash;&ndash; <BR> <BR>In many instances below, when I use the word &quot;you&quot;, I'm talking to the populace in general. <BR> <BR>Jay &ndash; I'm not sure I understand your <b>carrot</b> idea. Do you mean to say that type user's should be rewarded for not stealing fonts? I disagree with this. The reward is the fact that you haven't stolen property from another and you now own (or rather have licensed) another typeface. And I'm afraid again it goes back to how you were raised. I'm sure our parents and guardians didn't say to us, &quot;no one is looking, go steal some candy because I'm not buying it for you.&quot;  <BR> <BR>Hrant just posted, &quot;How can you do that when the religion of Capitalism teaches just the <BR>opposite?&quot; <BR> <BR>We can rationalize all we want, but type designer's spend time on the type they produce. Capitalist's understand that time is money. Something that took time to produce must be worth something. And for those of us that consider ourselves to &quot;know great type (or design) when we see it&quot;, it is unfair of us to want great looking type for free. Or worse to think we deserve great type for free. And worse still to say we deserve X amount per hour and then have the nerve not to pay for a $40 dollar typeface.  <BR> <BR>&mdash;&ndash; <BR> <BR>We should start a 12-Step Program For Font Addicts.</div>

So, therefore, if someone is susceptible to corruption, it stands to reason that they might also be susceptible to incorruption. Or at least given the tools, through education, to become more or less incorruptible. We are humans, we are not, nor will we ever be perfect. But, we can learn right from wrong, make the right choice, and improve ourselves. <BR> <BR>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; <BR> <BR>When I say education, I'm not only thinking of students.

Have they been given the wrong idea about how inexpensive fonts can be? <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>And what do you all think about free fonts? Genuinely free, licensed as such.

		<div class="commentbody">[group] &quot;Hi, Tiffany&quot; <BR> <BR>The reason I feel that there needs to be a carrot is that the problem is so pandemic. If you find someone who has fallen down the stairs, your first action is to stop the bleeding. Then you teach them how to hold on to the hand-rail. Reversing the sequence won't work. <BR> <BR>If we don't give people a reason to stop stealing fonts, they won't stop. If the only reason to stop is a negative (&quot;If you don't stop we will sue you&quot;), it might stop a few people, but it will also engender a lot of ill-will and drive the practice underground. (Something I wonder about, but have no info: how many people have read the news articles about the actions of the RIAA and said:&quot;Kazaa? What's that? Cool! Where can I find it?&quot;) <BR> <BR>Stopping the bleeding won't be easy: there are too many fonts out there, and they can't be recalled or disabled. Most students, and most start-up designers, exist on a bare-bones budget. Encouraging them to spend money for fonts (&quot;Hmmm, Meta or Beer? Wow, that's a really tough choice!&quot;) is going to be very difficult. <BR> <BR>The carrot doesn't have to be expensive. This is not a fully thought out action-plan, but here's a scenario: Provide design teachers w/ a CD full of exploded fonts (discussed above). Enclose on the CD bios of the font designers, descriptions of the fonts &amp; suggestions for proper usage, &amp; a discount coupon for unexploded versions of the font. Font designers get visibility (for marketing purposes, and to put a face on the victim of font piracy); students get new, interesting fonts to work with, teachers get tools &amp; opportunity to talk about piracy &amp; why it's a Bad Thing. <BR> <BR> <BR>&gt;We should start a 12-Step Program For Font Addicts.  <BR> <BR>Why? They taste good, they are good for you, and they don't cause cancer! <BR></div>

Along with a wireless network card of some sort. Apple works with educators on this point.

I've been trying to get my school to buy a decent font collection - even if only for two or three &quot;type specific&quot; labs - for nigh on three years now. We just had a good instructor quit over the lack of type and the beaurocratic hoops you have to jump through to [not] get it.  <BR> <BR>And the closest we got was our bookstore selling the dubious FontSite CD. :-/  <BR> <BR>&gt;forking over $100 for a typeface to set a headline in their fake magazine comp.  <BR> <BR>I also agree with darrel on this point. If a student won't even fork over $400 or so for the entire Adobe Design Collection, there's no way they'll fork over the cash for a single font. Not when their PC comes with TNR and Arial. <BR> <BR>IMHO, the real issue lies with the schools - not with foundries. I think the schools should be held responsible for buying decent font collections (i.e., providing resources for the students) - rather than the foundries having to undervalue their products.</div>

We are pretty close to releasing it. The specifics will be announced soon, but essentially it is a pre-selected collection of 22 fonts licensed for 25 seats at a price that is not &quot;dumping&quot; but definitely a decent deal. It would be offered only to school labs. The fonts would not be &quot;exploded&quot; or crippled in any way, but rather named in a way that made it clear they were part of the lab's resources. We also have yet to finish the modified EULA, but even more important right now is the text files that explain the history of the fonts. I think there is some good discussion here about the educating students (and designers) about proper font usage and licensing. I would like to add additional explanations of the licensing issues to our &quot;read me&quot; file (but who actually reads those?.) <BR>Any design instructor who would like to contact me directly about our EDU pack, please do, The final details have yet to be hammered out, and I would be glad to entertain feedback on this. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The general attitude is one of entitlement as <BR>many students (I didn't say all) are &quot;poor&quot; and  <BR>feel the fonts should be theirs because <BR>they could never afford them.  <BR> <BR>This however holds little water. It's an <BR>issue of priorities (how to spend ones $). <BR>The &quot;but I'm poor&quot; excuse is hard to take  <BR>coming from a student holding a Titanium G4 <BR>while wearing Diesel jeans and Puma trainers <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm&hellip; I'm still thinking on the free fonts thing. If people are willing to do the work for free, that makes it a hobby, not a profession. But some people build boats as a hobby, others are professional boat builders. <BR> <BR>I can understand that some fonts are worth developing for the sheer fun of it, but they aren't worth the extra effort needed to finish them to a &quot;sellable&quot; state. <BR> <BR>I'm wondering why there is such a jump between free fonts and fonts that cost $20 per face. You rarely see (legitimate) fonts for $10/per, or $5/per. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just read this (not fonts, but file sharing in general): <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0%2C1412%2C60613%2C00.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,60613,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,60613,00.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>This is a sample of what I thing of as &quot;carrot and stick.&quot; The carrot is that students get access to broadband. In order to get the access, they have to agree to abstain from illegal file sharing. If they try to file-share, they get smacked with the stick &ndash; immediately. If they try again, they get smacked harder. If they try a third time, they get kicked off the network. <BR> <BR>The second page has a link to the Electronic Freedom foundation, <a href="http://www.eff.org/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.eff.org/">http://www.eff.org/</a></a> . It's kind of disheartening; since we (designers, producers &amp; vendors of type) are interested in the reduction of software piracy, we aparently are in league with &quot;&hellip; governments and corporate interests worldwide [who] are trying to prevent us from communicating freely through new technologies, just as when those in positions of power controlled the production and distribution of &ndash; or even burned &ndash; books they did not want people to read in the Middle Ages.&quot; <BR> <BR>[Sigh] <BR></div>
