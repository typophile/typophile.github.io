  so I thought I'd bullet-point the bigger items for my own and others' easy reference:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ascender
  Corp.</li>\r\n<li>Bitstream, Inc.</li>\r\n<li>China Type Design Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>Faces.co.uk</li>\r\n<li>Fonts.com</li>\r\n<li>Fontwise</li>\r\n<li>International
  Typeface Corporation (ITC)</li>\r\n<li>iType</li>\r\n<li>Linotype</li>\r\n<li>Monotype</li>\r\n<li>MyFonts</li>\r\n<li>Planetweb</li>\r\n<li>WhatTheFont</li>\r\n<li>WorldType</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThey
  are also the owners of what remains of former parent corporation Agfa, as well as
  the vestiges of various smaller companies they've acquired and shuttered. Additionally,
  they are the creators and sellers of the Adobe Type Collection, but they license
  those fonts from Adobe.\r\n\r\nHave I forgotten anything? In compiling this list,
  it strikes me that they own the three biggest competitors and the two biggest retailers
  in the industry, which seems like something the DOJ usually files a lawsuit over."

    in the industry, which seems like something the DOJ usually files a lawsuit over.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    DOJ investigated the Bitstream deal and approved it. Owning web sites for selling
    fonts has not created an anticompetitive situation. Monotype cannot jack up prices
    just by owning web retailers. Most of the fonts sold through those web sites are
    owned by third parties, and those third parties set prices, not Monotype. The
    exception is Fonts.com, where Monotype tried raising prices above what the foundries
    would charge, but those fonts seem to be selling better elsewhere. Nor can Monotype
    raise prices on the Lino/Mono/ITC IP. They face stiff competition there from Adobe,
    URW, Scangraphics, etc., who all sell the same or better digitizations for lower
    prices. All Monotype\u2019s acquisitions have really done is raise its profit
    margin by ensuring that it keeps all the revenue from almost all sales of old
    fonts like Helvetica, Univers, Futura, etc.."

    take out of its competitors' sales if they want access to the largest marketplaces.
    The advertised commission at MyFonts is 50%, although some apparently have more
    attractive arrangements.\r\n\r\nAs for Berthold, I added it after Googling Monotype
    and Berthold and seeing a clutch of headlines from news aggregator Topix about
    an acquisition. But it turns out those are forum posts, and there's no official
    word, so I've removed it from the list."

  body: "Monotype\u2019s retail sites are only the largest marketplaces because of
    all the third parties selling there. Attempting to drop royalty rates would likely
    result in type designers signing deals with Phil\u2019s Fonts, Fontspring, Font
    Bros, etc.. Some type designers would likely not even sign a Monotype contract
    at lower royalty rates. This would rapidly end Monotype\u2019s position as the
    dominant player in font retail. \r\n\r\nAnd the job of antitrust regulators is
    to protect consumers and innovation. They are not tasked with protecting the royalty
    rates of small business owners who just want to keep the status quo."

    they come up with new regulations that fit your scenario so they can charge you
    even more.  It's about time the licenses laws were regulated and in plain English!
    \ I find it hard to believe that anyone can be 100% compliant with their font
    licensing if the goal posts change!  They own everything and now they're making
    new rules every five minutes monotype? should be monopoly-type!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Can you give examples? Font licenses have trouble keeping up with changing
    technologies - even things as basic as document embedding rights terms were written
    at a time before commercial ebooks, and new things like iOS apps and webfonts
    weren't even considered. I know that Monotype and others have tried to write their
    EULAs in way that would adapt to the changing technological landscape - but that's
    easier said than done.
