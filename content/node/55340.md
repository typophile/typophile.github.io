body: "I got an email newletter from MyFonts that had an interview with type designer
  Cyrus Highsmith, woh before the interview I had not known. It was interesting to
  read to see how someone can be so happy with what they do, as well as see their
  creative process. One thing in particular I liked was his scans of his sketchbooks:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/199706_002_3969.jpg]\r\n\r\nInteresting
  to see how other people think and map ideas out. Check more out [[http://www.occupant.org/sketchbooks/|here]]."
