body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nLooking for some input on a New Years resolution I'm
  making. For the next year I want to work with a limited set of typefaces. \r\n\r\nThe
  idea of working with \"a few good typefaces\" has always appealed to me, but I've
  never decided what those should be. Now that web fonts are sufficiently supported
  (90% of my work is web design), I have decided to pick 20 typefaces to work with
  all year.\r\n\r\nBut I have a slight problem. I narrowed my selection down to 17
  \ typefaces and don't really see any more that seem necessary.  Do you see some
  glaring omissions in this list? Or is 20 not really a very restrictive number? Should
  I aim for 10, 5? \r\n\r\nHere's the selections so far:\r\n\r\n<strong>THE SERIFS</strong>\r\n
  \   1 - Beufort\r\n    2 - Caecelia\r\n    3 - Clarendon\r\n    4 - Chapparrel\r\n
  \   5 - Palantino Nova\r\n    6 - Perpetua\r\n    7 - Georgia \r\n    8 - Iowan
  Oldstyle \r\n    9 - ITC Charter\r\n\r\n<strong>THE SANS</strong>\r\n    1 - Avenir
  Next\r\n    2 - FF OCR\r\n    3 - Gill Sans\r\n    4 - Myriad\r\n    5 - Optima
  Nova\r\n    6 - Sweet Sans\r\n    7 - Trade Gothic\r\n    8 - Verdana\r\n\r\n"

  body: "While you should be highly selective in your use of typefaces, you should
    be using MORE of them, not fewer. Consider purchasing a new font family to provide
    each new client with a distinctive look of their own.\r\n\r\nBut as a basic toolkit,
    that's not a bad lineup of fonts there."
