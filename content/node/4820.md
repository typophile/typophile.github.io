body: I have a photograph of a hydrangea head that I am trying to create to look like
  the ones in the stationery below.  I am using Photoshop 7.0.  Does anyone have instructions
  on how to do this or links to online tutorials?   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/36158.jpg"

  body: How good is the photo? Silhouette the flower, put the image on its own layer
    and put a rectangular marque around the photo and make it into a brush. Pick a
    PMS color and use your newly created brush and paint.

  body: I think you&#39;re looking to emulate the illustrated etching of the illustrations
    in your sample, right? <BR> <BR>If so, you should check out the Andromeda Filters,
    which do a decent job of changing photos to faux-etched illustration. <BR> <BR><a
