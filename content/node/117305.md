  by S-Core? \r\n\r\nThe \"N\" (= neutral) version is on discount at the moment (for
  example here http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/s-core/core-sans-n/), and I would like
  to hear about how it works for large amounts of text like in books. \r\n\r\nHas
  anyone ever mixed the different members of the family, \"N\" with \"G\" for example?
  Are small caps included? I once saw that there\u2019s an extra \"SC\" font available
  \u2026\r\n\r\nThanks!"
