  don\u2019t want others to copy it and say that they did all the work. It is a .ttf
  file can it be right protected? I mean copyright so that no one can republish it

  body: "In certain jurisdictions, the copyright notice alone \"protects\" your ownership.
    Unfortunately, legal protections only work when you are dealing with law-abiding
    people. As a rule, thieves tend not to be law-abiding people.\r\n\r\nSeveral years
    ago, an outfit named Art I Need took huge swaths of freeware fonts, opened them
    in Fontographer, changed the fonts names and the copyright information, then sold
    the fonts as their own. Many of my freeware fonts were among them. Art I Need
    went out of business, but sold their assets to Jupiter Imaging, which continues
    to sell the fonts.\r\n\r\nIf it were worth the trouble of pursuing legal action
    against Jupiter Imaging, I would. But it's not. The thieves won. And will continue
    to win, because they do not respect the rights of others.\r\n\r\nSo, the short
    answer is: No."
