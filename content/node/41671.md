    (although Type87 in New York, which I couldn't make it to, was a precursor). Type90
    was my first type conference, but I already recognized the social patterns, from
    conferences and conventions in other fields. It was exhilarating. I recall how
    startled everyone was at Zuzana Licko's talk, in an old Oxford hall, when she
    did an animated presentation in HyperCard and played loud music as a soundtrack.
    \r\n\r\nThe prime mover of Type90, Roger Black, is spearheading the 2009 ATypI
    conference, in Mexico City, which we are in the midst of planning now. This year's
    conference, in September, is in St. Petersburg, Russia. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.atypi.org/05_Petersburg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Jay Rutherford\r\nYes, yes, Type90 was indeed a milestone. My first big design
    conference was Design87 in Amsterdam, where Erik Spiekermann gave his \"Sex and
    Type and Rock 'n' Roll\" talk. I had attended a few local or national (Canadian)
    things, but Type90 was a revelation. The city of Oxford was nice (I bought lots
    of marmelade and had it mailed home at great expense), the Type90 post cards and
    such from Jonathan Hoefler were very special (commissioned by Roger Black, I believe).
    Susanne Licko's talk was brave, thumbing her nose at the old guys in a nice blue
    miniskirt, I seem to remember. She and Rudy noticed my early Emigre globe T-shirt
    in the lunch hall. I think Rhonda Rubenstein was there, as were many other luminaries.
    The Type90 T-shirts really sucked though -- a cotton-poly mix -- too thin, too
    cheap. Adam Twardoch had his on a few years ago (in Helsinki, I think) -- I don't
    know how it survived the years. Mine shrunk up to fit my 5-year-old son after
    two washings (maybe Adam has never washed his). \r\n\r\n[jr]"

  body: 'I was there. It was my first UK trip, my first type conference, and it all
    happened just before I started at RIT. I only heard about it when I met Mike Parker
    in Boston, maybe a month previous. It was an amazing turning point for me, discovering
    "famous" type people like Berlow, Carter and Spiekermann, plus other young designers
    like Jonathan. I made some wonderful friends I still keep in touch with. Fun memory:
    sneaking back into the bedroom window of the hostel after a late Type90 event.
    I believe I still have the conference program.'

    where they should have gone.\r\n\r\nThen there was the \"Share a beer with Ed
    Benguiat\" event, and Ed never showed up.\r\n\r\nI remember Mark Jamra bumming
    GItanes off of me in the lounge, and having to catch a cab to the outdoor festivities
    when I missed the bus. I met Bruno Maag there and he was excited to be moving
    to the States to work for Monotype.\r\n\r\nI remember the Linton Lodge where we
    stayed on the outskirts of town, the Jolly Farmers pub, and some chinese restaurant
    that claimed it served dim sum to the empress of japan.\r\n\r\nThe pound sterling
    was trading at $2."

    I was so broke in 1990 that I could not have attended a type conference even if
    the only transit I had to pay for was a cross-town bus.\r\n\r\nBut I am very glad
    to have met so many of you since then at other conferences. Something will have
    to go terribly wrong in my life or in the world to keep me from being at ATypI
    in Mexico City next year.\r\n\r\npowers"
