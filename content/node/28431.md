  body: "These are hardly 'earmark' letters, so probably any number of slab serif
    fonts could be used to re-create this. Lubalin Graph Bold, for example. Memphis
    and Rockwell (and others) could also be candidates, especially if similar is good
    enough.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: All the slabs I looked at (including Lubalin, Stymie, Rockwell, Beton) have
    a thinner bar on the E than the sample. I couldn't find a match for that.
