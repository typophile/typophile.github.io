  body: And don't expect much. Newspapers are notorious for not paying freelancers
    well (in writing and photography, I am assuming the same for illustrations). About
    the only reason to pursue that work is as a path to a full time job (if any newspaper
    ever hires anyone again ... it may not happen the way the industry is going.)
