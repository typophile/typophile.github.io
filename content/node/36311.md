  particular the main font used for \"San Francisco\". I suspect it is stylized from
  an existing font, but if so is there any font I could use as a base to replicate
  the letters, or other letters not present?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.postcard.org/greetings.htm|Greetings
  from San Francisco]]\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance.\r\nShane"

    eleswhere about the large lettering -- search for \"postcard fonts\". <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/copal_std_ot/\">Copal</a>
    is an option. \r\n\r\nFor emulating the script, consider <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/freehand_521_regular_ot/\">Freehand
