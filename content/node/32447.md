  assignment together with a friend of mine, and we are looking for some feedback
  on a logo we designed. We are both developers and therefor not so good at designing
  a logo :)\r\n\r\nWe are going to develop mobile applications and games using Flash
  Lite. We came up with something and are wondering if you might have some critique.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nJasper"

  body: "It's very web 2.0, which seems to be what you're going for, so good for you
    on that count.\r\n\r\nDid you create this as a raster graphic? The only reason
    I ask is that \"FUNK\" seems blurry. You should create logos as vectors so they
    will scale better.\r\n\r\nThe star is a little too far into the 'K' for my liking.
    Also, you may lose details in the phone buttons in small or low-resolution environments
    (such as on a phone).\r\n\r\n - Lex"
