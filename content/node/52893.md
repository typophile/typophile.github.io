  body: "I like the direction this is going in, but a lot of letter combinations need
    work.  \r\n\r\ntd, tg, te, rc are slightly off.  \r\n\r\nkt, av, rv, dw and similar
    combinations need custom ligatures, but I'm sure you know that. \r\n\r\nsw, rv
    and rp look great. \r\n\r\nI think the uppercase M is wrong... shouldn't be squashed.
