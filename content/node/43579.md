  body: "For what it is worth, I have used the old Cycles a fair bit. My only grumble
    is that is is a bit thin with direct-to-plate printing, which is quite understandable
    given that Sumner made it in the repro days. I have the new Cycles in various
    sizes, but have not used it so cannot confirm my impression it will still be a
    tiny bit thin with DTP printing. But I have this complaint about lightness-when-printed
    with a lot of fonts; other may find it just to their taste.\r\n\r\nHave also used
    Stone Print for a long text. Wonderful font if you don't specify the measure too
    long. You can really pack in the characters, to either save space (book length)
    or increase margins.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco Public Library looks very interesting,
    in between Cycles and Stone Print in terms of how condensed it is. There is a
    fair need for slightly condensed fonts, and SFPL looks like it might fit the bill
    for this.\r\n\r\nI have been using Magma Compact for a few books now, and like
    that too. I've used it paired with Quadraat, and for a companion display sans,
    like it better than Quadraat sans.\r\n\r\nAs to ITC -- Sumner once remarked that
    he had to license the Stone \"clan\" (Stone regular, sans, and informal) back
    from ITC in order to sell them, even though he was the designer.\r\n\r\nAll in
    all, I think there are some good bargains here on some pretty darn good fonts."

  body: "I can hazard a guess why Stone's font site is becalmed. The older serif text
    faces have been around a long time and nobody needs to acquire them here. But
    the newer ones, which ought to be flying off the shelf on merit alone, offer deal-breaking
    problems of incompleteness and formatting. \r\n\r\nSFPL, very attractive, lacks
    a bold italic. What happens when some Bay Area librarian wants bold italic? Does
    her boss reply, \"Mister Stone said you won't need it\"? And consider Cycles from
    a type consumer's viewpoint: what the f----?! Of the four optical weight text
    families, only Cycles nine and eleven have even a semibold roman, and none has
    a semibold italic. And that blizzard of specialty fonts for fractions and tabular
    this and that could all have been folded into an OpenType version by now, which
    Stone does not offer. Compare Cycles against its nearest competitor, Arno Pro
    by Slimbach: not only complete in OpenType, but more than complete! For this reason,
    Arno will probably also kick Requiem's ass, even though Requiem is superior on
    details--R still has no bold or bold italic. "

  body: While I am always for more flexible type families, I don't think a lack of
    bold italic is really a big sticking point. Cycles is essentially a book face
    and bold italic is almost never used in book typography. And, to be honest, there
    is really very little reason to use it elsewhere.

    finished my 12th non-fiction book design, and every single one of those 12 manuscripts
    required bold AND bold italic somewhere. And, believe me, the client does not
    want to hear that the designer of that typeface he liked so much refuses to supply
    bold italics! Stone certainly did so before (Stone Serif's bold italics look better
    than their romans!) so I can't understand his attitude now. It's a crowded market;
    purchasers would like to be free to use a book face on other editorial work; nobody
    has to buy something released incomplete. "

    it mildly.\r\nWhile there may be some truth in what you say, it's pushing it a
    bit to state, as you often do, that typefaces without a bold italic are \"incomplete\".
    Someone else, who uses mice type or display type a lot, might consider these potential
    family members indispensible. Then there are those who want language support.
    And others who can't do without small caps, or old-style figures. And so on. Ultimately,
    a good typographer knows what features and styles are present in typefaces, and
    designs to these capabilties and strengths. "

  body: "While I'm the first to cry out for as many weights as I can get, particularly
    bold italics, I've successfully used Whitman as the sole typeface in the corporate
    identity of a financial client (3 1/2 years running). It's certainly possible,
    if you have enough control over the situation and are willing to walk some people
    through it. It's also a nice test of one's skills to find alternate solutions.
    However, I will admit that it creates certain limitations, such as no titles in
    bold heads, etc.\r\n\r\nSome typefaces, such as the aforementioned Requiem, are
    designed in such a way that heavier weights would violate the purpose/ spirit
    of the face, so those marketing them should be up front about the intended specialized
    use. Requiem is a book face (and I've seen it do a fantastic job in books like
    <em>Cloud Atlas</em>), so the only reason to add weights to a family like that
    is to increase sales, not to truly serve the user.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I have
    had clients who balked at a type choice with that 'limitation'. If I write about
    a type family, I always mention its range and note the lack of any expected weights/
    styles, as should anyone reviewing type. As a type consumer, I can attest that
    offering a family without a bold italic will limit a typeface's appeal/ sales,
    particularly amongst non-typophiles. But the worlds is full of choices, so why
    kvetch?"

    italic are necessary and are \"deal breakers if absent\" that it will sound as
    though 1,000 people have all separately and independently clamored for bold and
    bold italic. Not so.\r\n\r\nTo share my own experience \u2014 I often will not
    buy the bold and bold italic even when they are available. Titling and small caps
    are far, far more important to me. I have used bold italic once in a book design
    and it worked quite well, but it is not indispensible. Almost always, I think,
    it is better to do without them. There is now a proliferation of what could best
    be described as the Word-document-design-aesthetic and it is the new ugliness.\r\n\r\nThus
    I was quite disappointed to find that the new edition of the Scifi novel Dune
    used bold italic on epigraphs. It is a step in the wrong direction, I think: it
    looked better before. \r\n\r\nI'm sure that bold and bold italic have their place,
    but that place is not at the very center of book design."
