  body: "@ Mike:\r\n\r\nAfter some further looking I doubt it's John Baskerville...
    I selected that as an option based off the numbers 1886 from the sample. The 1
    is unlike anything I've found in other versions of Baskerville.\r\n\r\nIf it is
    indeed a version of Baskerville, the biggest question is what digital version
    would have been available in the early 90s with old style numbers?\r\n\r\nThe
    Adobe version 'BaskervilleBE' from the early 90s came from the Berthold cut and
    doesn't have the old style numbers. I don't believe the Linotype version has them
    either.\r\n\r\nI found 'Baskerville 353' from Foundry listed on pg. 29 and 30
    of 'Type Speciman Book' but aspects of that don't exactly match the sample. I
    keep looking at the italic \"f\" and regular \"g\" in the print and can't get
    past how much shorter the tail is on the \"Q\" in comparison with that of Baskerville.\r\n\r\nIt
    might be <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=ITC+new+baskerville&q=Go\">ITC
    New Baskerville</a> but the \"1\" doesn't seem to match. :\\"

  body: Some of the characters (notably <strong>r</strong> and <strong>f</strong>)
    are visibly thicker than others, and the counters on the <strong>e</strong>'s
    are partially filled in. This makes me think that Penguin didn't set new type
    for the 1994 edition, but scanned tearsheets from an older edition that had been
    printed from Monotype or Linotype.

    a typeset version, although the digital option was becoming dominant by the early
    90's (I'd guess). They used something with SCOsF. Without any of my type/font
    books, I'm not sure which digital foundries offered that then, but Monotype, Linotype,
    ITC and Berthold were dominant at that time. (Adobe was mostly offering versions
    designed by one of those foundries, Relatively few fonts were their own versions
    at that time.)\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    ends up very distorted and at first distracting to read, why do they do this?
    Surely it's worth retypesetting it? Or is it just about profit margins?
