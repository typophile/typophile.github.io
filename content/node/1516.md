  body: I got the Scott Kim book when it was published in 1981 and tried doing some
    of that stuff myself for a short while. It&#39;s not easy, but it can be fun.
    I find it interesting but ultimately kind of a novelty.  <BR> <BR>Did you know
    Scott Kim designed the original Adobe logo? Not only that, some of the illustrations
    in his book were done using a predecessor of PostScript called JaM. The book was
    published in 1981 by Byte magazine and has a &#34;backword&#34; by Jef Raskin,
    the guy who started the Macintosh project at Apple. <BR> <BR>Kim&#39;s stuff is
    more interesting intellectually, but Langdon&#39;s stuff is more aesthetically
    pleasing.

    gotten better since he wrote <i>Inversions</i>. I  <BR>especially like some of
    the animated pieces. &#40;I think maybe  <BR>he needs to pay some attention to

    <BR> <BR>If you can find a copy <i>Inversions,</i> it has lots of tips  <BR>and
    strategy advice for doing ambigrams, although you can  <BR>gleen quite a bit just
    by analyzing existing ones.

    truth do you believe there is in this? \r\n\r\nThere was a mystic called Abraham
    Abulafi (c.1240-1292),  who used a method to combine letters, reversing and rolling
    them around to achieve a state of 'wisdom and knowledge'. I wonder if there is

    even if a little research would tell him something different. It is safe to say
    that the reason ambigrams appear in the book is that John Langdon shares a name
    with Brown's protagonist, Robert Langdon, and that brought them together.\r\n\r\nBut
    of course secret societies use wordplay. The \"ICHTHUS\" acronym comes from the
