  typeface is the same as this author's previous novel \"The Lovely Bones.\" We didn't
  get it last time, thought I would try again. Thanks for your help. - Chris[img:sites/default/files/old-images/almostmoon_type_6662.jpg]"

    DINs out there, like Normalise DIN or DIN 17, but neither is an exact match.\r\n\r\n

  body: Stefan, it's a book cover, not a poster. Her first book was a smash success
    so they have replicated the design, even the title is similar.

  body: Because this type matches the FF DIN skeleton exactly, I'm inclined to believe
    it is either an advance copy of [[Albert-Jan Pool]]'s DIN Rounded or the 2002
    <a href="http://typographica.org/000344.php">modification by Mattias Jakobsson</a>.

  body: Thanks, Patty, for the link to the "Lovely Bones" cover. This confirms my
    guess that it's based on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_bold/?sample_text=LOVELY%20BONES&sample_size=36">FF
    DIN Bold</a>. Even the arguably loose 'LY' kern is the same.
