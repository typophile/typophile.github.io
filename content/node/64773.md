  can be found in the capcom games \"super muscle bomber,\" \"super street fighter
  2\" (and turbo), and \"super street fighter 4.\" i think the \"HYPER\" in \"hyper
  street fighter 2 anniversary edition\" uses the same font, but i don't have a screenshot
  of that for comparison.\r\n\r\ni originally thought it was a condensed bold or black
  futura, but the S is too different. i'd like to think this is all one singular font,
  however, as opposed to mixing futura and helvetica or something.\r\n\r\n<em>(solved
  - \"Avant Garde Gothic Bold\")</em>"
