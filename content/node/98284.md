body: "Hi. I would very much appreciate some suggestions. \r\nI'm designing a photobook
  and I have Stampel Garamond as body text but need a typeface for the headlines and
  page numbers. \r\n\r\nI have been using ITC franklin Gothic, but I found that its
  a bit to close the Garamond with its humanist lines. The book is about science fiction
  (but in a very abstract way) \r\n\r\nMaybe a very tall tapeface that has a lot of
  character or maybe something more standard line MT Grotesque. Would be great if
  it was a modern contemporary typeface or at least contemporary looking. \r\n\r\nI
  tried with Raisonne but its a bit to much, but maybe something along those lines.
  \r\n\r\nThanks!"
