  Egyptienne Extra Narrow Medium</a> but it's not quite the same. Any guesses?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/verify-test_5821.png]"

    it's been customized). Notice the curved connections between the main strokes
    and the serifs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/verify-test_6119.png]\r\n(URW
    Egyptienne is on the bottom)"
