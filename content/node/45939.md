  finished up a font and have decided to unleash it on the world for free.\r\n\r\nZandvoort
  is a Font containing numbers (1-99) in circles. Both open (black numbers in a black
  outlined circle) and closed (white numbers in a black circle) versions are included.\r\n\r\nIt
  should be pretty easy to find the number you need, as everything is laid out very
  systematically. Use the Shift and Option keys to access all the numbers.\r\n\r\nYou
  can get it here:\r\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/Zandvoort\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm glad you like it. I created it for use at work to save me from having
    to manually place numbers into circles every time I needed them. I know there
    are some existing font like this, but I didn't like how they were setup, so I
    wanted a solution that was very systematic.\r\n\r\nKatharina -- I'd love to see
    how you use it.\r\n\r\n"
