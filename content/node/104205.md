  body: "Note the generally triangular serifs. This resembles a 19th century style
    then called Latin. Not certain if there is an exact digital match, but if there
    is one,  our typophiles will probably find it for you. This is pretty close, a
    font from the Connor's Sons catalog of 1888 digitized as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/ysleta-nf/\">Ysleta</a>
    by Nick Curtis. In this font the Latinate serifs are clipped in an angled style
    called Detroit or Mansard -- a refinement that may or may not be present in your
    samples. This version of the Latinate  style was also known as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/aetna/\r\n\">Aetna
    </a> or Painter's Gothic.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Here is a true Latin with triangular serifs and no fancy tips:  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/great-western/\">Great
    Western</a> by Font Mesa. Not quite as close as Western Railway, but better designed
    and executed.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Don. These guys use it willy nilly so often and the funny little detailed
    roughness of the E is identical in both cases so much so that it makes me feel
    strongly this is a digital typeface somewhere. I've asked them but they are a
    small market and they don't know. They can't even point me to the people who did
    the work for them originally.\r\n"
