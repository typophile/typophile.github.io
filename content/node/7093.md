  body: But the source French word is stressed on the last vowel &#40;although both
    &#34;e&#34;s have an acute accent&#41;. Of course the French word is also pronounced
    with a &#34;gh&#34; instead of a &#34;r&#34; sound, but that&#39;s admittedly
    getting a bit pedantic. <BR> <BR>&#62; the -ez in French is usually pronounced

    <BR>Well murr-say bew-cup to that. <BR> <BR>It reminds me of a comic strip published

  body: Americans usually use the English diphthong, saying &#39;ay&#39; instead of
    the pure long &#39;a&#39; without the y as is proper in French. And French usually
    say the English long &#39;a&#39; among many other English vowels without their
    proper diphthong. And those with kindness and tolerance gently correct those who
    want to improve their French or English.

    accurate reporting.  You constantly trap yourself in self-fulfilling prophesies.  There
    is just as much bias in French media or anywhere else in the world as there is
    in American media, you just choose to focus your attention on the media which
    fulfills your prophesy.  Yes, there are vile repulsive Americans to be found,
    I readily admit that.  There is an equal proportion of vile, repulsive people
    from any other country as well.  You will find them easily if you look as hard
    as you do for Americans. <BR> <BR>ChrisL
