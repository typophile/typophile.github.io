  discover it years ago! Great work from all involved!\r\n\r\nAnyway, for my first
  post I have what I imagine is a custom font but wondered if anyone has an idea where
  it originates from.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_3859.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  can anyone point me towards a good site where I can find good quality contemporary
  fonts as Im on the hunt for something modern, minimal but with a twist!"
