  body: 'It&#39;s interesting, Tiepolo looks like a clone of Hiroshige &#40;by Hollandsworth,
    now Batty&#41;, and was made by Richard Baker, the same guy who made Hiroshige
    Sans in 1986, the same year - in fact the same year as the original Hiroshige!
    I smell something. It&#39;s like they made a version they could sell themselves,
    and a version they could sell to ITC... <BR> <BR>Also note that there seem to
    be different versions of just Hiroshige: MyFonts shows one with slabby serifs,
    others with flaring ones, and even one with possibly something in between! <BR>
    <BR>So the sample actually looks a lot like both Hiroshige Sans and Tiepolo, which
    both have a closed &#34;P&#34;, unlike Hiroshige... although you&#39;ll note that
    that &#34;P&#34; was modified <i>anyway</i>, so... The &#34;E&#34; I&#39;d have
    to look again. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'I agree there are very subtle differences and smells of some liscense trickery.
    However, I believe the sample provided is in fact Tiepolo &#40;at least that&#39;s
    what my helmet tells me&#41;. The reason being the P. In Hiroshige sans, the E
    is indeed the same as Tiepolo, but the P is not closed as you indicated above,
    while it is in Tiepolo and in the sample. The sample is not large enough to detect
    any discernable difference in the other letter forms: <BR> <BR>Hiroshige Sans
