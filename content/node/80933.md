body: "Hi, I've recently started to work on my first thesis work.\r\n\r\nIt will be
  a historical research on typographic catalogues \"from Guthenberg to www.ynotype.com\",
  followed by the creation of a comprehensive font catalogue that will serve as the
  official font catalogue for the Fine Art Academy in Lecce, where I study.\r\n\r\nThe
  catalogue will comprehend a little taste of everything from serif to slab and sans,
  and the selection is supposed to help the students  to get involved into typography,
  as well as to give them a basic palette of powerful and top-crafted types to work
  with.\r\n\r\nSo here I'm asking for help to find accurate historical infos about
  historically relevant font catalogues, i.e. the fonts owned by Guthenberg or Aldo
  Manuzio (just to give two examples of the first waves of font designers and printers),
  the font collections by Bodoni and/or other romanthic designers, the earliest font
  collections for Monotype and/or Lynotype etc.\r\n\r\nI'm currently studying over
  and over Bringhurst books - the elements of style and the history of printed word,
  but I'm searching for more accurate and specific books.\r\n\r\nAlso deep insight
  on particular catalogues would be nice since this is a third-year thesis so I'll
  have a page limit and I can't write a proper book about the matter.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for all the suggestions!\r\n\r\nPeace\r\na.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That sounds great.\r\n\r\nI've found more infos about modern 'catalogues':
    Vignelli's 'few typefaces' (a very rude choice in my own opinion, but worth discussing)
    and Frutiger's complete typework.\r\n\r\nI'd like to find more informations about
    Robert Slimbach's catalogue of fonts, and I'm struggling to find more infos about
    old type catalogues - e.g. Guthenberg's types and Francesco Griffo works for Aldo
    Manuzio (the only informations I've found up to now is that Griffo designed six
    romans and the first italic ever for Manuzio, that he was granted the sole use
    of the types, but nothing more).\r\n\r\nAny more suggestions?"
