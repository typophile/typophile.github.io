body: So I have this idea for a font, but I don't know if it's already been done before.
  I want to atach some scans of some of the rough sketches of the alphabet for it,
  but I'm paranoid that someone will steal my idea. How would I find out if my idea
  has been done already? I try to search for keywords regarding the font, but I dont
  think its good enough. Should I just make the font anyway?

    and do a better job selling it, so it's sort of moot... Plus if you make your
    idea public you have a weapon against plagiarism, since you can establish a date
    (although you won't really have Proof).\r\n\r\nWhat you might do is develop the
    idea enough to have a big head start, then show it to get feedback.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
