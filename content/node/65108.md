  coming from various design boutiques these days? I'm talking stuff that you'd see
  featured every now and then on <a href=\"http://www.behance.net/\">Behance</a>,
  and in the work of  <a href=\"http://www.non-format.com/showcase/milky-disco-2/1/\">Non-Format</a>.
  \r\n\r\nUsually letters are deconstructed into basic shapes or pure line, then modularly
  designed, edging the border of legibility. I've seen it referred as type and typography
  countless times, but in my opinion it's more along the lines of display lettering.
  I guess that sorta counst as type right? Is this artistic style a welcome departure
  from traditional typography, or is it in danger of hijacking the definition of what
  \"type\" is?"

    has nothing to do with whether something is type or lettering.\r\n\r\nThe lines
    between type and lettering have become blurred by OpenType alternates.\r\nWhen
    it's possible to set a wordmark or headline with a font that has lots of alternate
    glyphs to chose from, including swashes, and do so either by selecting from a
    glyph palette, or going with the contextual substitutions built-in to the font,
    then the process of typographic design is more like that of lettering.\r\n\r\nThis
    isn't really new. The famous Photo-Lettering Inc. was a type house (mid 20th century).\r\nThey'd
    work from film-strip fonts, and then modify details of a setting by hand, e.g.
    making ligatures.\r\nSo was that type or lettering?\r\n\r\nDuchamp would have
    called it an assisted readymade.\r\n\r\nReal display lettering is distinguished
    by the possibility that you might get your hands dirty--but so is real typesetting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    only moderate skill, and only one notable talent: discerning what will be fashionable
    in the immediate future. Success in display face design is also largely a matter
    of luck - which to me is a turn-off. In contrast, making a good text face requires
    grasping and balancing so many subtleties, and having such a command of spacing
    and texture, that it takes my breath away. A text face reflects the personalities
    of billions of people, over centuries.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    ligation, this genre is \"lettering-proof\", as there is no opportunity to hand-nuance
    joins. (Sorry Ricardo, nice s_t lig, but the face, dark though it is, doesn't

    presenting the process of the latter at a recent AIGA event, Michael Bierut flippantly

    drift of the conversations that "the real thing" is text type as opposed to display
    lettering or type, whichever you prefer. Is text type hard to design? Yes, very.
    Is display type hard to design? Well in my opinion, yes. Good design is just that,
    good design, and bad design is bad design. Display type serves a purpose and if
    the purpose is served by the new trend in very heavy, at times difficult to read
    types, so be it. If one could find a generalization about this it is that display
    type is very much dependent on fashion or the fashion of the moment, while text
    type rarely falls in line with this. Baskerville, Garamond, Caslon, Bodoni, Fairfield,
    and others are as much in use today as text type as they ever were. The images
    presented here by Nick S and Eliason are examples which make my point re display
    as a statement about the fashion or design trends of the times. '
