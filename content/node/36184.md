body: I have an open source application that requires fonts to be in truetype in order
  to recognize them.  I was wondering is there an application that can convert a Type
  1 font into truetype for Windows XP.  I understand that if I have the pfb. and pfm
  file I could just install them in the system font directory and the will render
  correctly by the operating system, but my problem is that the application itself
  does not recognize the font unless it is a truetype.

  body: Install fontforge. Open the PFB. Choose File->Generate. Select TrueType from
    the formats dropdown menu.
