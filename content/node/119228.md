    no hits on it in the major databases.\r\n\r\nMost likely from a smaller foundry.
    I'll keep searching."

    [same font is used on this page]\r\n\r\nNazareno Crea has a history of creating
    custom fonts for his projects, and given that he's used it on his personal site,
    I'm willing to bet it's not commercially available."

    the old specimen books will soon be mined out and we will have to design fonts
    from scratch :(\r\nBTW Old Style Antique was on my \"someday\" list. The arrowhead
    serifs, the almost montotone character ... oh well, such is life.\r\nDon"

    rather than a fame seeking quest for the bizarre, it runs up against the fact
    that an incredible number of good design concepts have already been done. \r\nNothing
    original in this idea,  \"The old fellows stole all of our best ideas,\" is a
    popular quotation from Frederic Goudy.\r\nDon"
