body: "This sample comes from a musical score for Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, and
  I think it's a reproduction of a 1930s original, but I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nI've
  got a couple more samples, but mostly of the same letters.\r\n\r\nWhat the Font
  pointed me to a superficially similar face called Bellini, which cited as inspiration
  the 1923 face \"Gans Progresso\", but from a sample I found, it lacked the extreme
  axis this type's 'o' had."

  body: These are similar in a lot of ways, but they lack the most distinctive features.
    Take, for example, the d; it lacks a space between the bowl and the bottom serif,
    and has a large top serif facing right than left.
