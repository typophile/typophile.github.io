body: "Good evening Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI have attached my first attempt at a text
  face. I'm particularly concerned about inconsistencies in stroke contrast and overshoots.
  Screen legibility is definitely an issue as well.\r\n\r\nI am aiming for a very
  traditional, garalde-ish book font; something in between Hoefler, Arno, Gentium,
  Sabon etc. \u2026 but it's drawn from scratch. (Why the effort? I'm hoping to one
  day arrive at a free webfont and maybe even at a math family for font-deprived TeX
  users.)\r\n\r\nI'd be extremely thankful for your input!\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  I am afraid only few dare to publicly offer their opinions here. I appreciate your
  thoughts even if you've never designed a font yourself!"

    good!

    and terminals are similar \u2026 but the overall feel is different enough. Any
    ideas on how to make the whole face more \"even-looking,\" especially on screen?"

  body: "Pleasant :-)\r\nSome pretty random thoughs:\r\n- some letters appear definitely
    taller than others (a, e, c, for example).\r\n- spacing is too tight, and you'll
    need some kerning too.\r\nEvenness on screen is a matter of hinting (you could
    start here: http://typophile.com/node/13964)"

    horizontal strokes, and added your suggestions. Here's a new attempt (same document):

    still absolutely wonky, but that will be taken care of soon enough (it has to
    of course; as some of you have noted, Crimson will be part of Google's font directory).\r\n\r\nI
    really hope to get some more advice from you, what I've read so far has been extremely
    helpful!\r\n\r\nSebastian"

  body: "Wow, this is really your first try at making a font?! Amazing!\r\n\r\nWell
    here are some comments from me. Take with a bit of salt because I'm not at all
    an expert.\r\n\r\nProportions are very good; this does remind me of Arno.\r\nTerminals
    on C could be heavier.\r\nI'm worried the curves of D and O may need to be heavier.\r\nFoot
    serifs on F and P could be wider on the right to balance the top-heavy forms.\r\nM
    may be slightly too narrow; N too wide?\r\nUpper counter of R seems too high;
    I think I'd make the top of the bowl a bit darker than the bottom where the leg
    joins.\r\nS may be falling backwards but it's hard to judge.\r\nCrossover at centre
    of W may need some offset.\r\n\r\nLowercase\r\nThe contrast on e seems a bit too
    vertical. Particularly the nw segment looks too dark for classical contrast.\r\no
    seems to need some optical correction; is it symmetrical?\r\ns may need some more
    weight in the serifs and perhaps a hair less in the spine.\r\nLeft arm of y seems
    to get rather fat at the baseling.\r\n\r\nNumerals\r\n1 could have a larger flag.\r\n6
    needs a larger bowl I think.\r\n\r\nGreat stuff."

    Printouts just don't look <em>right</em>, but I don't know how to fix it up. (Maybe
    the spacing isn't perfect. Or printing at 300dpi just kills it.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crimsontext_1_01_5941.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    please take a look at my numerals. I'm not really happy with them, either.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crimsontext_1_02_5975.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
    you! The italics shall follow soon :)"

  body: "The italic lowercase s is optically tilted more, I think it\u2019s the upper
    terminal doing this.\r\n\r\nThe italic lowercase w looks spindly on the left side,
    with the middle being very prominently dark. Shift weight from one to the other.\r\n\r\nI
    think that italic r, n, m are slightly closer to vertical than the letters with
    straight ascenders. This makes them seem out of place. You don\u2019t seem to
    be aiming at a very baroque italic, judging by the consistent pen angle, so the
    differences between them and the others should be minimized.\r\n\r\nYour italic
    p bulges out too much on the top right.\r\n\r\nThe italic a looks weak at the
    top, but I\u2019m not sure this is a bad thing yet.\r\n\r\nI like the f, and the
    y is nice as well. I haven\u2019t made up my mind about the k or the g yet.\r\n\r\nGreat
    work! Keep at it!"

    be that the variations in slant are due to my scaling down the image to a Typophile-phile
    size? Because really, there aren't any. Or then again, maybe that's precisely
    the problem :-)\r\n\r\nHere's a new attempt:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crimsontext_italic2_3800.png]\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, whoever wants to try out today's development release, it's on <a href=\"http://www.aldusleaf.org\">aldusleaf.org</a>.
    But beware, it's not usable really.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
