body: "Hi there\r\nWe just finished a design job and sent it off to the printers.\r\nIn
  the email we included the measurements of 180x300mm.\r\nNow, I got a call back from
  the printer telling me my supplied \r\nartwork wrong. He told me It is portrait
  and not landscape as stated \r\nin my email. \r\n\r\nApparently in printing it is
  always Y before X. \r\nWell, that is in New Zealand. I studied and worked\r\nin
  Switzerland and it was always X before Y.\r\n\r\nI thought about the whole scenario
  and I'm wondering\r\nif there is any reason for that? Something traditional? \r\nor
  printers hate math?"
