  <BR> <BR>This looks like <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script08Pg4.html">Hudson
  &#40;Solo&#41;</a> from Mike Y&#39;s script font guide. However, I can&#39;t find
  an electronic version. I&#39;m certain it&#39;s available electronically, since
  the sample came from a banner ad. I&#39;ve also seen it several other times in print
  and on the web. It must have another name. What is it? <BR> <BR>s&#39;marks <BR>

  body: The only digital version of Hudson that I&#39;m aware of is the old Brendel
    Informatik font, which I believe is what is being sold now under the Quick Brown
    Fox <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm" target="_blank"> Serials Collection</a>
    label.

  body: 'Indeed, Joseph. I was at work when I posted the above, but I find, now that
    I&#39;m home, that I listed the wrong derivation of the font. <BR> <BR>I got my
    copy via that very Fontsite CD and the copyright is Softmaker, a German company
    which has occasionally released fonts together with Brendel Informatik in the
    past '

  body: Thanks guys, it looks like these are useful sources for Hudson and other fonts.
    It seems that Hudson is enjoying a resurgence in popularity; I saw it on some
    packaging in an office supply store yesterday.
