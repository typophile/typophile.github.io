body: Hello, <BR>As a font user, rather than a font creator, I&#39;m not really familiar
  with font file technicalities. <BR> <BR>What I need to know is what is the easiest
  way to change a font name, in a true type font file. <BR>&#40;The software I&#39;m
  using embeds the font into an executable file, but if a font of the same name is
  on the user&#39;s system, then it uses that instead. This is causing me real problems,
  as some of the target audience have a different font file, with the same font name,
  and the text is all wrong on their screens&#41;. <BR>I need to change the name of
  the font - jst prefix it with a number and an underscore or something - while the
  program compiles. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>S
