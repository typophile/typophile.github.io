		<div class="commentbody">OK, let’s get into it, then.
First of all, Mendeleiev's Periodic Table of the Elements is one of the greatest achievements of modern science, structured by an inner logic which, at the time of its conception, not only allowed to organize the chemical elements ALREADY known but also those YET to be discovered (radioactive substances, for instance). Here it is used as a mere "cool-looking graphic scheme" with no inner logic whatsoever. Lazy, shoddy stuff.
Now to the "Typophile" part : in my opinion, making this kind of selection without referencing a specific context (academic, professional, publishing, etc.) is utterly useless — but THIS ONE is really, really, flawed : why include Robert Slimbach's AdobeGaramond AND Franco Luin's Garamond Classico, for instance ? Isn't one digital "real" Garamond (i.e. not based on a Jannon model) enough ? Why Griffo Classico and not Monotype Poliphilus ? Why Monotype Bembo AND Bitstream Aldine (which are more or less the same typeface) ? What's "Realist" about Baskerville ? And WHICH Baskerville, by the way ? Monotype ? ITC ? Storm ? Isn't Old English more "Popular, Influential and Notorious" than Manuscript-Gotisch ? Where's Fournier ? Where's Monotype Centaur ? Where are Bell and Bulmer ? Which Kis ? Linotype Kis Classico, Monotype Ehrhardt or Janson Text ? I could go on like this for hours, but would it be worth it ?
This thing LOOKS LIKE it has been THOUGHT OUT when it has merely been COMPILED — it is thus an insult to its model (Mendeleiev's work) AND to its subject (typographic culture).</div>

Maybe it is my being a teacher that makes me go ape when I encounter this kind of easy/debased/false "culture" — thinking that one of my students could genuinely take this so-called "Periodic Table of Typefaces" at face value and mistake it for a serious, useful tool makes me very, very, very angry.</div>

A poster in a TypeCon goody bag past, with spot silver, IIRC.

The design of this is not very professional*, which gives it an air of scientific authenticity. Is that intentional irony or stupid irony?

It's symptomatic of the sketchiness of web culture that the source material is not real research, but opinion and aggregation.
Real research here would classify according to taxonomic exemplars. That would reveal the disparity between elemental system and typographic system.

The most "scientific" of type classification charts is phyllogenetic, i.e. the evolutionary tree.

Besides, how can the universe function without Papyrus and Co(s)mic Sans?

		<div class="commentbody">There was a time, during the late 1990s, when the Periodic Table of Elements metaphor was being used (and abused) by every other graphic designer. Maybe the trend got its start with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spend-Everywhere-Everyone-Always-Forever/dp/1861542798">that Damien Hirst monograph</a> (designed by <a href="http://www.designmuseum.org/design/jonathan-barnbrook">Jonathan Barnbrook</a>, by the way). Seeing it resurface after ten years or so put a smile on my face, quite frankly. Sure, somebody who doesn't know much about typography (or high school science!) <em>might</em> take this at face value, but the makers clearly state that they have simply taken other people's popularity rankings into account. They even have the links listed at the bottom of the table! And the subtitle reads "Popular, Influential, & Notorious"! I think that constitutes fair warning. :-)</div>

Having the links to the original lists and compilations listed at the bottom of the table does not appear to me as "tongue-in-cheek". On the contrary, it lends to this dubious document an air of indisputable authority by naming people (Paul Shaw, Roger Black, Jan Middendorp) and organizations (FontShop, Typographica, The Type Directors Club) which are justly respected in the field of graphic and typographic design.</div>

I'd also suggest that it is symptomatic of a problematic kind of graphic design that apes the appearance of information design without actually understanding the conceptual basis of that design. This is just a list of popular typefaces arranged in boxes to look something like the periodic table of elements; there is nothing in the kind of information that it presents that either recommends this arrangement or benefits from it.</div>

This is to the periodic table what the Paris hotel/casino in Las Vegas is to Paris, France. But some provincial peons still go to the resort in Vegas and -in a small part of their psyche- actually believe they're somehow approaching the real deal.

This explains precisely why it can only bear a superficial resemblance to Mendeleev's ground-breaking work -- "We couldn't really attempt to do what the Periodic Table of Elements actually does, because then it wouldn't <em>look</em> like the periodic table, and what would be the point of that?"

I agree with John's assessment. I also understand why Stéphane, as an educator, might be frustrated and irritated by what it pretends to be.</div>

I'm afraid it already took me six academic years to come up with a "definitive" typeface selection (AND a way to organize it and make students use it) suited to the needs of my teaching (never forget the context), so I may not be the ideal person to undertake such a grand endeavour. 
Furthermore, I simply wouldn't have taken Mendeleiev's Table as a starting point (see Nick's comment above).
Nevertheless, I must also admit that my title to this post was inaccurate : this stuff is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen WHEN IT COMES TO TYPEFACE CLASSIFICATION — no more, no less.</div>

I think if someone were to suggest that some fixed and limited set of specific typefaces were all that were necessary for all design by everyone and everywhere, that would be both foolish and also easily demonstrated to be false. But I think there is nothing wrong with a designer determining to work with a limited set of his own choosing that is useful for the kind of design he or she practices. Frankly, I can imagine working with only one or two typefaces, and the only reasons I would be likely to change them over time would be either my own desire for variety or the appearance of a new typeface that seemed more useful.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Should I defend?  I'm reading all your comments and I can't really come up with something, but I will say, you are all exactly right.  Right, but I guess I just wanted my intentions to be known because I love this site.

I had a great conversation with a University of Michigan instructor recently that hated the design that explains much of what the complaints on here are about.  It's actually my favorite moment of this whole ordeal (read through the short comments section):  http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/03/11/yet-another-periodic-table/

Basically what it boils down to is that: 
1) It was never my intention for it to be anywhere near the achievement Mendeleev's original table was.  

2) The design is meant to bear a passing resemblance to the periodic table of elements (simply for familiarity's sake) and when the viewer does a second take, they see typefaces. 

3) I didn't choose the typefaces (for those that complained about leaving some out).  I didn't choose the ranking ORDER of typefaces.  The sources listed at the bottom of the design were used. I chose those sources (granted, some had more credibility than others but I didn't just willy-nilly choose lists to go off of) and annotated each and every typeface mentioned on all the lists in Excel.  I then annotated their ranks in each list.  Then how many times they appeared on lists.  Finally averaged all the scores each typeface received and sorted the columns using the aggregate scores.  The first 100 typefaces that resulted were used in the table. So if there's a problem with why certain typefaces aren't on it and why one is ranked higher than another, the sources, again, are listed on the bottom of the design.  Ask them.

4) The arrangement is again far far far from perfect.  Again, it wasn't my intention to make it perfect.  Just to resemble the table of elements.  That's it.  I DID put groups of same families and classes together because it gives it SOME organization and they look good together.  Also, they are numerically sorted WITHIN each family/class groups.

5) Honestly, I had no idea how played out the kitchy "Periodic Table of (insert anything here)" was.  I'd never seen one other than the actual elements until after I uploaded my design.

6) Finally, the honest-to-goodness truth is that when I uploaded the design on the Behance Network last Monday evening for the first time, I checked "looking for feedback" because at best, I thought it would get 30 views maximum and maybe get some tips on improving the design.  I never once promoted, sent out the link (except to some friends) or tooted my horn in anyway. I woke up Tuesday morning to 5,000 views on the page and now it's at 37,000, not counting the seemingly endless blogs linking to the large size image (thereby passing up the Behance page completely) and more and more blogs linking to other blogs that are featuring it.  Again, not my intention.

I'm sitting here wondering why I'm defending this here at Typophile so much.  This site is the only one I've done this with (other than Punya's that I linked to above, but I was much more brief).  I guess it's because I respect this site and it's members and would much rather express my views to this group rather than the few sites where the critiques are a bit harsher.

For those of you that "get it," thank you very much.  For those that don't, that's a-ok, I still respect you all and what you do.

I'm sorry but I just thought of one last final defense.  I've noticed on many sites in the comments and in many of the e-mails I've received, this design has just slightly opened the eyes of folks that previously took typefaces for granted.  They stick with Arial as the default because they never really had a good look at the options presented to them in such a way.  Also, there have been many comments from people that never fully realized that typefaces had designers with real names and that people actually cared about when the a particular typeface was designed.  So for the design to at least spark a bit of interest in the world of typography and it's history, it can't be THAT stupid could it?

Thank you again for all that you folks are doing.  Keep it up!

> the one the reader chooses

There's a very simple reason this is a bad idea: the reader isn't necessarily qualified to know what's good for him. This has in fact been empirically demonstrated at least once, where readers were asked to choose the point size they thought was ideal for reading, and they chose sizes that were slightly too large. This is because consciousness cannot properly judge what the subconscious really favors.

Why deny us all (the masses or the great unwashed)  this simple pleasure? Because it can mislead us and we will be more likely to commit typographic atrocities?

Now for the typophylogenic heresy:

I think that type categorisation and classification is a bit fuzzy at best, and arbitrary and subjective at worst. Anyone who believes that it can reveal some fundamental truths in a way similar to that of the Periodic Table thinks too much of typography or too little of science. <em>That</em> science would be Hrant's cheap, plastic, scaled-down model in LA.

um, well yeah, hrant, i will let you be 
the one to try to convey that to them.

but if you tried to tell that to _me_, 
as a reader, i'd laugh in your face...

and if you persisted, i'd spit in it...

or maybe not...  the idea that you can
tell someone that some font which he
might hate would be "good for him" is 
too silly to be serious enough to spit...

even the reasonable idea that one font
will "serve the text" better than another
-- which is how you should've put it --
is one that many people simply do not
fathom, even on a subconscious basis,
even if their shortcoming on the issue
might seem to be preposterous to us...

but all of that is really beside the point,
not just for fonts but on a general basis.

if you give end-users a choice between
a system that gives them control versus
one that does not, they'll usually choose
the system that _does_ give them control.

even if it ain't the one that's "good for them".

I actually don't think so. But respecting greatness (by not caricaturizing it) in other fields is a Good Thing.

> i will let you be the one to try to convey that to them.

No. They don't really want to know. We simply have to work under their radar. Quietly. Without writing loud poetry.

> many people simply do not fathom,
> even on a subconscious basis

No, I think almost everybody does.

Yes, this is the crux of the problem. People have been brainwashed into thinking they know everything. Because this makes them easier to deceive and control. Hopefully one day we will manage to make humility a cornerstone of our society.

i thought your project was endearing.
evidently, so did lots of other people.

***

one of the first times i saw the periodic table
being used as a presentational device was in
a hypertext story "e:electron" by deena larsen.

deena larsen:
>   I have a variety of works on the web 
>   that use everything from ferris wheels 
>   to the periodic table of elements
>   as structural analogies 
>   for my stories and poems.

you can find an overview of deena's work here:
>   http://www.deenalarsen.net/

other hypertext authors have used the device too:

>   Directions, by Rob Swigart 
>   The Eastgate Quarterly Review of Hypertext, 
>   volume 1, number 4
>   Directions is a multimedia hypertext poem, 
>   taking its inspiration from 
>   the periodic table of the elements.

>   Quam Artem Exerceas, by Giuliano Franco
>   The Eastgate Quarterly Review of Hypertext, 
>   volume 1, number 4
>   Centered on the periodic table of the elements, 
>   combines poetic fragments, visual images, 
>   prose narrative, and sound to create a deep, 
>   dazzling, and often startling work.

and here's a periodic table of science-fiction:
>   http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/periodictable.html

and another, this one for "visualization methods":

right.  because they don't really care...
heck, they probably don't even _notice_.

which is exactly what i just said, above...

further, if you were to point it out to them,
they'd probably say "oh, yes, you're right",
and then shrug their shoulders and forget it.
because there's no reason for them _to_ care.

you guys know.  and care.  fonts are your life.
most people aren't you.  don't know.  or care...
other things are much more important to them.

and book publishers.  and magazine designers.

for most of our real-world experience, to now,
we haven't had the chance to control our fonts.

so it's no surprise that now, when we finally do,
we just take whatever is given to us as default...

however, it is no longer true of e-book people.
they know they control the font (when they can),
and they _use_ that capability, and they _like_ it
-- consider it to be one of the perks of e-books --
and now _demand_ it from e-book programmers.
and they reject the e-book formats -- like .pdf --
which do not let them use the fonts they prefer...

no, the _crux_ of "the problem" is that you
consider personal choice to be "the problem".

but the cat is now out of the bag on that one.

the end-user controls the font, like it or not.

and that's the way the end-users _like_ it, so
those are the systems that they're gonna use,
even if _you_ don't think it's "good for them".

That cat has been out of the bag, out of the house, out in the street, and out of the country. That cat owns its own bag. But I don't think it's personal choice that's the problem, it's some people's propensity to "repurpose" it to enslave us. And some slaves apparently applaud their masters.

> are you immune to humility?

It's about context. It's counter-productive for me to be too humble about type design when dealing with a typographic novice. But for example even though I know a lot more about politics than most people, I still don't vote. Most people who vote are impressionable, self-important peons.

Is it that way? Absolutely not. Any version of Linux, or even Mac OSX, gives more control to the user than Microsoft Windows. But the winner is MSW. In the same sense, say, MS Word gives a lot of control either nobody cares or uses. As you say somewhere, the user don't mind it. I agree one must tend to give users the more of control, but only in the user's scope. I'd not allow users to chose i.e. memory cache size or low level device addresses. Much of the system must remain transparent to the user ever. I think typographic decisions are not within the scope of users' choice; you can allow them to change font size, but spacing and alignment should be out of their control, the same as font face; perhaps it could be a reduced set of default fonts. When you fly on a plane, you enjoy a lot of options that don't include the kind of fuel, the speed, the altitude, the lift area size, or even the name of the pilot and his crew: they all are matter of the airline company; worse: I guess the silly man at control would not let you press a single button within his flight deck.
We had endlesly read and/or written that type design should remain imperceptible for readers; well: how could they decide on something they don't see?

		<div class="commentbody">the Periodic Table of Elements, as you all know, simply lists the elements in numeric order based on the number of particles they are made up of, starting with Hydrogen. This allows you to predict and classify undiscovered elements by simply filling the blanks once you've listed all the known ones, and further, to predict their properties. 

To do this with type, Is really quite easy. Let's say we assume a 1000 × 1000 M quad, going in a similar numeric order, just start listing all possible combinations of units that are black or white and can be classed as glyphs in a known alphabet…

Then again, maybe not. :¬)

I'm not sure if you've looked closely at this graphic but the firm that created this "periodic table" is pulling it's content from numerous surveys of typical typefaces that designers use professionally. So, your comment that <em>"without referencing a specific context (academic, professional, publishing, etc.) is utterly useless" </em> is baseless because the context is implied. 

<em>thinking that one of my students could genuinely take this so-called “Periodic Table of Typefaces” at face value and mistake it for a serious, useful tool makes me very, very, very angry.</em> Now, we all have our jaded view on what typefaces we like/dislike and why but if this is <em>"One of the stupidest things I've ever seen"</em> you lead a truly privileged life. 

Mendeleiev is dead, so I wouldn't worry about him being offended. But if you are that upset about it I would suggest taking a vacation.</div>
