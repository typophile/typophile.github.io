  body: "The letterforms match Desdemona,* but either it was thinned/shaved, or there
    is a sans serif interpretation based on the same pre-digital model.\r\n\r\n* Available
    as Desdemona (by Font Bureau, bundled with some Microsoft products), but only
    in outline version. As Desdemona (by Will Harris), but with a different |S|. As
    Quaint Gothic (by Jim Spiece), with alternate |S|.\r\n"
