  my fonts to the system 9 fonts folder &#40;i have an ibook with classic&#41; it
  works for indesign and photoshop but i cant get the fonts i wish to use to appear
  in illustrator 10. <BR> <BR>Has anyone an idea of why this is not working and what

  body: Have you quit and restart illustrator? that solves many quirky errors. <BR>
    <BR>So you are using indesign, photoshop and illustrator all in classic? &#40;That&#39;s
    what I understand from what you wrote above&#41; why not at least use OS X for
    illustrator. <BR> <BR>Volume\Library\Fonts. <BR>or Volume\users\username\Library\Fonts
    <BR> <BR>If not be sure you are running Illustrator in classic if that&#39;s where
    you are storing the fonts. <BR>
