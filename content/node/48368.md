  body: "I like this one. It's nice and subtle and balanced. Funnily, in this one
    the \".com\" doesn't bother me as much. I think it might be because everything
    else doesn't lend itself to an online company that it doesn't take it over the
    top. \r\n\r\nI like the subtle shade changes in the rose mark, however, I would
    suggest changing the perspective. Right now it doesn't look much like a rose.
    I think a head-on perspective (looking into the center of the rose as opposed
    to the side) might work better. For some reason, a Charles Rennie Macintosh rose
    came into my mind when I read the name. Here's an example: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5158M2VM5GL._SL500_AA280_.jpg\r\n\r\nIt's
    a nice simple shape and I think would work well with the overlapping, transparent
    petal feel you have right now.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: It's 100% better than 99% of all city logos. That said, it has a very dated
    'web 2.0' feel to it and might not hold up that well over time.

  body: Thanks everyone. I actually had some other logos sketched up with a very similar
    rose to the one suggested. I'll continue to play around with a few more and repost
    them. I agree that it's not very rose-like.
