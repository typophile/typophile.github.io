  saloon-hot-iron-brand typefaces. These typefaces will be used to design a contemporary
  magazine advertisement with a Western-style flare.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples
  of what I like so far,\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/applewood/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/device/chase/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/\r\n\r\nAny
  research help, or advice about using these or other Western-style typefaces together,
  is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n- corey"

    plenty of western feeling fonts out there. You seem to like the distressed woodtype
    variety. I would just search woodtype at Myfonts.com and see what comes up. \r\n\r\nMaple
    doesn't scream western, but it has a certain flavor:\r\nhttp://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/index.html\r\n\r\nLetterhead
    fonts has some nice display faces. Font Mesa also has a few.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Playbill is pretty classic.\r\nIt was a retro design in the 1930s (when Westerns
    were popular in film), harking back to the previous century's Italiennes.\r\nThen
    in the 1950s it became hip when designers started repurposing Victoriana (such
    as blow-ups of old engravings) in modernist layouts. \r\nWide letterspacing of
    the caps was part of that look, so blocky, kind of architectural.\r\nThere are
    both clean and distressed versions.\r\nSo it has a range of allusions."

    no fun.\r\nIIRC, Rosewood Fill has been more used than the fancy or full Rosewood,
    and is more interesting for the very reason that it is being perverted. Rather
    like using micro fonts at display size (eg Bell Centennial with the huge ink traps)."
