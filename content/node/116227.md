  body: "Jim Spiece is not very forthcoming as to his source for the design for Asteroid
    Primo.  Asteroid Primo One, it is very similar to LHF Ambrosia. Dan X. Solo used
    the term Asteroid, but he was known for renaming old typefaces. Perhaps Ambrosia
    is the 1900ca name for this design? I don't recall it as an ATF design but it
    might be in one of type specimen books from another foundry. Whatever it was called,
    here it is in an engraved version used in a Brooklyn liquor license from about
    the 1890s [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrooklynLiquorLicense1890ca_4230.jpg]\r\n\r\nDon"
