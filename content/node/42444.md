  delicate as this one.\r\nIt could be custom, but I've seen a font like this that
  wasn't custom made. Seen it in a couple of fashion ads (maybe it wad for armani).\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MG_4776.jpg]"

    EDIT: Wasn't that easy + it was bigger differences than I first thought. Any other
