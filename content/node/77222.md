  looking for a text face with a short armed-f that won't collide with i's or l's.
  Can anyone suggest anything?

  body: "Urm, I wouldn\u2019t say it makes perfect sense. Basically there is a popular
    belief among children\u2019s book publishers that ligatures are hard for kids
    to read. So they ask book designers to turn them off. But there is no evidence
    for it that anybody has ever presented, other than anecdotal. (And we\u2019ve
    already seen that the anecdotal \u201Cevidence\u201D for infant forms for reading
    is contradicted by actual research.)\r\n\r\nI wrote a section on this ligatures-in-children\u2019s-books
    issue in my (co-authored) article on typography in children's books in the current
    issue of the American Library Association journal \u201CChildren & Libraries.\u201D
    Our sample  was the children's books which received Caldecott honors in the past
    20 years: 85 books once you eliminate wordless and hand-lettered books. Here's
    what we wrote on ligatures (albeit with some loss of formatting):\r\n\r\nIn children\u2019s
    books, especially those for young readers, ligatures may be a controversial option.
    While most typographers would prefer to use ligatures (as opposed to having colliding
    letters or excess spacing), it seems many of those involved in publishing for
    children are concerned that merging the letterforms is confusing to new readers,
    and ask that ligatures be turned off in the page layout software. Of our Caldecott
    sample, eighteen books use ligatures, forty-six do not, and the remainder are
    either unclear or don\u2019t have enough text for the question to come up. In
    some cases one can see a typeface in one book with ligatures, and the same typeface
    in another book without: <em>Tops & Bottoms</em> uses Cochin with ligatures, while
    <em>Duke Ellington</em> has it without.35\r\n\r\nOf the forty-six books that are
    obvious about their lack of ligatures, most of them are not beginner books. In
    eight of the forty-six, the lack of ligatures creates a serious problem with the
    letter spacing, including <em>Bill Peet: An Autobiography</em>, which is one of
    the most text-heavy books in our entire sample, and far from being a beginner
    book.36\r\n\r\nYet several of those eight books with ligature problems feature
    otherwise exceptional typesetting or typographic design. These include: <em>Tibet
    Through the Red Box</em>; <em>Click, Clack, Moo</em>; <em>Duke Ellington</em>;
    <em>Olivia</em>; and <em>The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins</em>.37 <em>Olivia</em>
    is an especially interesting case, because the book designer was clearly aware
    of the problem created by the lack of ligatures. Instead of allowing the letters
    to collide as they do in most of the other \u201Cproblem books,\u201D the designer
    adjusted the spacing between the \u201Cf\u201D and the \u201Ci\u201D and the \u201Cf\u201D
    and the \u201Cl,\u201D to avoid the collisions created by turning off ligatures
    (increasing or decreasing space between specific latters is called \u201Ckerning\u201D).
    How I Learned Geography is a similar case in that with ligatures turned off, extra
    kerning was required to separate the \u201Cf\u201D from the \u201Ci\u201D and
    \u201Cl.\u201D38 Both cases leave an odd-looking gap between the letters with
    the fi and fl combination, but somehow it isn\u2019t as obvious in <em>How I Learned
    Geography</em> using the Galliard typeface as it is in <em>Olivia</em> using Centaur.39
    Perhaps this is because of the smaller type size in <em>How I Learned Geography</em>.
    A typographer might argue that if ligatures were considered unacceptable, a different
    typeface should have been used, such that the standard spacing would work well.
    Many common text faces have an \u201Cf\u201D with less or no overhang to the right,
    and such typefaces do not fare as badly with default spacing and no ligatures."

    in the fonts, for those who prefer them.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this case, I think
    what you want is a font that has no ligated forms in the \"Ligature\" characters.\r\nIn
    fact, that makes a lot of sense for justified text, the reason being that if the
    typographer applies a value other than 100% to character spacing (and the defaults
    in Quark and InD are not 100%), then in tight lines ligatures will appear, but
    not in loose lines. Such inconsistency is poor typography, IMO.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe

  body: It depends on the face. Most sans work fine without them.  In this day of
    contextual alternates, designing a non-crashing f that only appears when needed
    is not a problem.   Like Nick, I include them anyway for those who "must".  Most
    of my sans ligs don't even join.
