  body: Maybe I don&#39;t. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>The &#39;SPORTS&#39; is reminiscent of

    target="_blank"> Agency Gothic</a>, but  <BR>not quite. It&#39;s possibly custom
    drawn, as there are a  <BR>number of weight inconsistencies in the characters  <BR>&#40;see
    the tail of the &#39;R&#39;&#41;.The &#39;EA&#39; is definitely custom  <BR>drawn.

  body: Or they they had a condensed version and extended it. Oof! You can tell that
    this was pulled horizontally. The vertical proportions are wrong.
