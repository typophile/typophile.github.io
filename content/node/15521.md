body: "We're working on a logo design for a natural foods grocery co-op.\r\n\r\nThe
  typography is one of our biggest problems. Our name, \"New Pioneer food co-op\"
  just does not break in manageable ways. \r\nOne solution I've come up with is to
  scale \"new\" horizontally, but I know this will mangle the artfulness of the typeface.
  What do I need to consider to recreate a typeface with a broader horizontal scale?
  (e.g. are there rules of thumb for creating extended width characters, as there
  may be for creating condensed faces?)\r\n\r\nAlso, the attached image is primarily
  exploring EdGothic from House Industries. We do not own EdGothic, but will purchase
  it if we decide to use it in our logo. For the purposes of comping, I used House's
  LetterSetter, then did a rough vector trace of the resulting low res .gif. What
  is considered best practice for doing comps with fonts that you do not yet own?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dont stretch anything. Especially in a logo.\r\n\r\nHow about making 'food
    co-op\" wider? By this I mean make each letter wider (design the 3 letters as
    extended, don't stretch them). To use more space, consider breaking the hyphen
    back out (not overlapped). At small sizes the overlapped hyphen may just make
    the 2 o's illegible. Co-op without a hyphen can be read as one wrong word. \r\n\r\nAlso
    consider hiring a lettering artist. Odd shapes and awkward breaks are part of
    their daily work. Since your existing efforts are all rustic, it would be no problem
    to draw it all custom. \r\n\r\nAlso consider having a logo with an organic (get
    it?) shape; if a letterer took this on, he/she might start with some more loose,
    lively, and less constrained layouts. All you need is balance, it's not required
    that a logo fit in a square. \r\n\r\nDoes New Pioneer have to be caps? \r\n\r\nIf
    you want to keep the elements you have, put the little leaf dingbat next to co-op
    to use up that space. Then you can stack \"NEW PIONEER\" on top of it for a tidy
    shape. Or use a nice leaf shape as the hyphen. Or...."

  body: Try setting the type in a circle. New Pioneer in the upper half and Food Co-op
    in the lower half. and place a graphic in the middle. It gives a level of importance
    (New Pioneer = name) (Food Co-op = what they are). Don't stretch the type. The
    type designer didn't design it to be stretched. One other thought do you really
    want the idenity to look cartoonish? I would take a more formal professional take
    to the look.

  body: "\"By this I mean make each letter wider (design the 3 letters as extended,
    don\u2019t stretch them).\"\r\nThis is what I was asking about. I know, for example,
    that when designing typefaces for small text sizes, certain alterations are made
    to the counters. What, if anything, is done to aid in designing an extended-width
    character? I'm asking specifically to avoid stretching the character.\r\n\r\nThese
    are some good ideas, and I'll certainly look into them. Honestly, this project
    has been a terrible ordeal. In fact, the chief complaint about our store's previous
    (current) logo is that it is too cartoonish. On the other hand, our brief was
    focussed almost entirely on communicating that it is a fun place to shop. Thanks
    for the observation. It hadn't come up as being cartoonish yet, but if one sees
    it that way, a million are sure to follow.\r\n\r\nedited to add the following
    confession:\r\nHopefully, none of the above sounds defensive or snappish. I haven't
    had the opportunity to work with identity stuff much, so it's incredibly important
    to me, but it's also identified a LOT of weaknesses I have as a designer. In short,
    I know I need plenty of help, but talking about this project makes me uptight.
    All comments and critiques are more than welcome."

  body: A fun place to shop doesn't have to reflect in the logo. It could be expressed
    in the marketing or in a tagline. Make your mark look like a quality place to
    shop. Thats a major reason to go there and leave the marketing to marketing.
