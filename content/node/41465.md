  I am not a programmer and am dependant on a software designer I'm working with for
  info on what can and can not be done graphically. I presumed I would have at least
  as much flexibility designing for Java as I would for say, designing for the web
  with HTML and CSS, but I'm not so sure.\r\n\r\nThe Java guy has been indicating
  that he doesn't think he can do this, or do that when I've been presenting comps
  so I'm starting to get worried. Does anyone have any experience or advice conering
  Java applications? Specifically...\r\n\r\n- Is the text anti-aliasing really as
  bad as I have been shown?\r\n- Can more than one typeface family be accessed from
  within a single app?\r\n- Can anyone refer me to any nicely designed Java apps so
  I can get a sense of what IS possible.\r\n\r\nI've been looking for info on the
  web, but I can very little current information about Java that concerns graphic
  design. It all seems to be about coding or at the best, UI design at the wireframe
  level.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    a small framework for Java, although not really recommended for conventional applications.
    The type is a bit blurry at small sizes, but it's still probably the best looking
    Java applet I've seen.\r\n\r\nBut I do believe that some things can be very hard
    to build with Java. That's why many developers prefer to build the application
    UI with Adobe's framework called Flex.\r\n\r\n-- <a href=\"http://www.omine.net/\">omine.net</a>"
