  on here I am hoping that someone can help me out.\r\n\r\nLately, I am experiencing
  a lot of difficulty with color management and I would like to know if any of you
  have tried-and-true processes, setups, etc. that you wouldn't mind passing along
  to a felow designer that is about to loose his mind.\r\n\r\nThis is my current setup:\r\n\r\n1
  - Mac 1GHz PowerPC G4\r\n1 - NEC MultiSync FE991SB Monitor\r\n1 - Dell E193FP Monitor\r\nAdobe
  CS 1\r\nSavin CLP28 printer\r\n\r\nI can get color to print properly, but it doesn't
  look right on my monitor and more importantly the colors do not print properly when
  they are sent off to press or to print in a magazine. When I calibrate my monitors
  and get it right on screen it does not print properly. \r\n\r\nThank you for any
  help you can provide,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    and every App on a Colormatch  1.8 Gamma profile, and used the US Coated CMYK
    for typical workflow.\r\n\r\nI would start by making a profile of my monitor with
    the Spyder, and use that profile for the auto screen adjustment in Quark, Indy

    a third party software for my proofer/RIP.\r\n\r\nI was letting the third party
    RIP handle the seps and color, and making my RGB color correction in Photoshop
    in the native 1.8 Gamma.\r\n\r\nI was having good consistent color using a Mitsu

  body: "[[www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/ pdfs/cs2_color_workflows.pdf|This
    PDF]] explains how to set-up a workflow in CS 2. It might be usable in general
    for you CS 1 also.\r\n\r\nIn general the monitors can be calibrated using a colorimeter
    for the screen. These are not too expensive, and easy to use. The big problem
    is the environment your are working in. It should be in total darkness, or illuminated
    exclusively by [[http://www.justnormlicht.com/|Normlicht]] that matches the chosen
    colour temperature of the monitor calibration.\r\n\r\nScanners can also be calibrated
    using a special scan-target and special scanner software that reads the target
    values, knows what they should be, and generates a ICC-profile for that scanner.\r\n\r\nThe
    most complicated situation is the printing situation. Some printers have a build
    in colorimeter that can scan a print of test swatches and create an ICC-profile
    for the combination of print-heads, ink-cartridges, paper/substrate, temperature,
    and humidity. I have one of those, and you can match your output very very close
    to eg. EuroScale CMYK and also a lot of PMS colours outside the CMYK gamut, <em>but</em>
    it only works when viewed in normlicht, in other lighting conditions the characteristics
    of the ink and substrate doesn't longer compare to, say, EuroScale if that was
    the case.\r\n\r\nSome RIP-software to control this nightmare is of course required.
    Same goes for the very expensive Xerox laserprinters who often use an external
    Fiery RIP to do the colour control.\r\n\r\nIn CS (any) you have the luxury of
    being able to do a mixed RGB and CMYK workflow. What I do is keep all colour scans
    and photos in RGB mode. All logos and elements that need EuroScale CMYK matching
    are in EuroScale CMYK. When the elements are combined in an InDesign document,
    you are ensured maximum quality no matter what kind of output method you choose.
    Say if a document is printed in EuroScale then I make a PDF:X-1a for EuroScale,
    all elements not all ready tagged with this profile is converted in the PDF conversion
    to take advantage of the full gamut of the output method. Now say the client wants
    to have the same document as a colour ad in the newspaper, then I just go to the
    newspapers website and download their ICC-profile for their headset rotation press,
    choose it in when I output the PDF:X-1a and all ink limits, and so on are used
    to the full gamut. It's a real timesaver and you will be sure to always deliver
    100% perfect material to the printer in question.\r\n"

  body: "The problem with leaving your photos in RGB is that there are a lot of colors
    that are out of the CMYK gamut. Obvious things that die in the conversion are
    blue skies, glowing reds and greens, etc\u2026  I prefer to convert as the last
    step before placing in ID - although sometimes after I convert I find that I need
    to color correct just a little more. The document is going to be converted either
    way - I'd much rather see it before I finalize.\r\n\r\nWhat I see in newspapers
    in America (I do a lot of newsprint) is that the photos need to be sharper and
    have more contrast than something going to a magazine - something a conversion
    is not going to give you.\r\n\r\nUltimately it sounds like your monitor isn't
    calibrated correctly. Do that and always use Bridge to change color spaces, that
    way your programs are in synch.\r\n\r\nPrinting color is an art, not a science
    and color management has not delivered the magic bullet (at least in the US).
    You do want to use it though since it's as close as we get to a standard.\r\n\r\nBest
    of Luck!\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\n"

    set the rendering intent in the colour settings dialog box before making the convertion.\r\n\r\nBut

  body: "Let me try to fill in some gaps.\r\n\r\n<strong>Can you be more specific
    about your press problem?</strong>\r\n\r\nBack Story:\r\nI am working for a stone
    company. For the past three years I have been the junior designer here and the
    senior designer took responsibility for our color management--he mostly eyeballed
    things and used the monitor calibration tools provided with OS X. Said senior
    designer is no longer working here, which makes me the \"only designer in the
    village.\" ;-) When I discuss this problem with him on the phone there is not
    much he can do because there was not much of a system in  place to begin with.
    The stone that we work has been very difficult to color manage because the shades
    are extremely subtle.\r\n\r\nWe have an ad that we are running in a magazine.
    The former senior designer created the whole ad from photography to layout to
    sending it off to the magazine for print. When the ad ran in the magazine the
    photo came out too pink/magenta. The original file looks fine from our printer,
    of course. \r\n\r\nIn the process of trying to fix the ad I discovered that the
    magazine requires a SWOP Certified proof for color proofing. We did not provide
    one of these originally so I got one made with the original file. The SWOP proof
    does not look like the image on my monitor or from my printer so I am perplexed
    about how to adjust the file for correction when I do not have a reliable source
    for testing. \r\n\r\n<strong>Which software are you using to create your artwork,
    InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop? Is it in the creation of pdfs?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
    photo is originally edited on Photoshop and then the ad was laid out in InDesign.
    I have tried different methods for creating the PDF for print and they all come
    out the same when printed on the office printer.\r\n\r\nMy feeling at this point
    is that the problem comes from an over all lack of color management and calibration
    coupled with an overall lack of knowledge about what is actually necessary for
    good color management and calibration.\r\n\r\nThe most frustrating part is that
    we never seemed to really have this problem until the other designer left. Now
    I am not doing anything differently, but nothing is working like it used to. I'm
    sure the company owner thinks that this is all my fault and I can't figure out
    how to fix it."

  body: Any colour I have printed is on offset presses. I never print colour proofs
    in-house. I have my monitor calibrated, work in Adobe RGB (1998) colour space,
    and convert my RGB images to CMYK in Photoshop using the printer's ICC profile.
    The printer sends me a contract colour proof. Never had a problem. Mind you, these
    are high-end book printers who have very finely tuned ICC profiles for each press.

    in my chain. The printer that we are working with (Savin CLP28) is merely a \"business
    class machine\" as opposed to \"Commercial Class\" or Fiery. This means that I
    only have 2-bit (hundreds of colors) printing capability in-house instead of 8-bit
    (thousands of colors).\r\n\r\nIf I cannot get reliable samples from my in-house
    printer then I cannot judge whether my color is correct without taking my files
    to be printed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe'll either have to get a better printer or I
    will have to start making frequent trips to Kinkos or AlphaGraphics.\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "Ink jets can be very accurate and are very affordable - they take a lot of
    ink and are slow but the results can be very good and they can be profiled.\r\n\r\nThat
    might be a solution for you.\r\n\r\nI am printing on a Canon C1 Imagepress and
    that thing is fantastic.\r\n\r\nBut here's the problem - you get a SWOP certified
    proof and it doesn't match the printers version. If you sent that in they would
    have a responsibility to try and match it. How serious they take that responsibility
    depends on the printer. If this is a printer you use all the time I would establish
    a relationship with them and work to get the best output.\r\n\r\nMy stuff goes
    all over the place and I just don't have that luxury so I have to find a middle
    ground for magazine work and newspaper work. I've been pretty successful doing
    that.\r\n\r\nReally until all your printers, scanners and monitors are profiled
    then you are kind of shooting in the dark at your end. And using the OSX screen
    calibration might work for some, but you are largely guessing.\r\n\r\nTake a look
    at Eye One  http://gretagmacbethstore.com/index.cfm/MenuItemID/290.htm\r\n\r\nThat

    [[http://h41186.www4.hp.com/country/us/en/pdp/designjet/90-summary.html?pageseq=563590|HP
    DesignJet 90]]. The RIP that can actually utilise the [[http://h41186.www4.hp.com/country/us/en/efi.html?pageseq=563591|EFI
    Designer Edition RIP]]. The one I have is an older DesignJet 10PS which is A3+
    and was a fair bit cheaper. HP made a few generations to replace my A3+ model,
    but it seems the DesignJet 90 is now the smallest inkjet with loop-back colorimeter.
    Other manufacturers may have products with similar features but I have no experience
    with other inkjets. Hope this helps.
