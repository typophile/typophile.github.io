  body: the oddity (i.e. funny thing) is that it works perfectly, but reverses the
    the digits in the name in IndDesign's font list.

    assume we're talking about OpenType fonts here; where in the OT specification
    is this restriction specified?"

  body: "AFAIK, the restriction that font names must begin with an alphabetic character
    only holds true for the PostScript Name.\r\n\r\nSince there are various different
    name fields within a font, I suspect that you may have mistyped the name in one
    of those fields and that InDesign is getting the name from that field whereas
    other applications are getting the name from somewhere else. In FontLab, double
    check that the name used in the Font Names, OpenType-Specific Names, and Additional
    OpenType Names all contain 47 rather than 74 and that your PostScript Name is
    something like 'FortySevenHalfTon'.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
