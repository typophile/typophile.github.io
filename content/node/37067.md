  is the minor \u2018a\u2019 so hard to design?\r\nOr am I the only one in the world
  who spends months designing and correcting\r\nthis tiny little letter in every face
  I do?\r\nOr is this indeed the most difficult and therefore interesting letter form?\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: Stefan, I think it differs from designer to designer.  I find the lc "o" and
    lc "x" the hardest. Lowercase "a" and "g" are most fun.

  body: "I usually have difficulties with the the 'o' and the 'x' as well.\r\nSometimes
    drawing the 'v' and 'w', so thay they fit with the style of the typeface, are
    also a pain. With the last design I'm working on, drawing the 's' has also been
    quite a lot of work."

  body: I spend a lot of time with lc a as well, not because it's difficult, but it's
    fun tweaking it to perfection. It's a unique letter. The hardest I would have
    to say would be lc s and e/c.

  body: "Yes, I think you are all right.\r\nI believe I spend so much time with the
    \u2018a\u2019 because it\u2019s so much fun, too.\r\nGuess it makes me a bad type
    designer enjoying so much drawing things like the \u2018a\u2019 and\r\nneglecting
    so much important things like hinting, making the hard letters and so on ;-)\r\n\r\nPeter,
    agree with you that \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019 are one of a kind in a certain
    way.\r\nStrange in my case that I use to take and keep (!) my very first and spontanous
    version of the \u2018g\u2019\r\nwhereas in the case of \u2018a\u2019 I do it over
    and over again.\r\nIn fact its because the straight line that in the \u2018a\u2019
    must not be a straight one, yet I don\u2019t want it to be\r\ncurved as well.
    Something in the middle. Sometimes harder to achieve with bezi\xE9rs than drawing
    it by hand.\r\n\r\nYes, the \u2018o\u2019! It is very hard. Fortunately it doesn\u2019t
    draw my attention too much :-)))\r\n\r\nLowercase \u2018s\u2019 is fun isn\u2019t
    it?\r\n\r\nOk ok better stop here\r\n\r\nthanks guys for your opinions\r\ngood
    to know that someone shares..\r\n\r\nStefan"
