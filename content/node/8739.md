    small applications, with the following alterations: <BR> <BR>1 Solidify Phoenix
    &#40;no feather lines&#41; with no stroke &#40;it&#39;s causing the shape to lose
    detail&#41; <BR>2 Enlarge the word &#34;Phoenix&#34; to fill the space that is
    framed by the horizontal lines <BR>3 Relocate &#34;PRINT &amp; DESIGN&#34; and
    also &#34;SPI INC&#34; outside of the framed area <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: Thanks Scott, <BR>Sounds good, the SPI Inc is really getting on my nerves
    but they registered the business name that way so it has to be included!  <BR>

  body: The registration mark in the &#39;O&#39; looks a bit like a crosshair shooting
    the phoenix, to me. More so on the solid and outline versions. <BR> <BR>I prefer
    version B, as well. I agree that the &#34;SPI, Inc&#34; should be moved outside
    of the ruled area. I&#39;m not as sure about &#34;Print &amp; Design&#34;.

  body: I don&#39;t think &#34;Print &amp; Design&#34; should be moved from the main
    logo, only on very small applications because it is too small to be read, as is.

  body: 'I agree with Chris &#34;don&#39;t shoot the Phoenix&#34;. I don&#39;t love
    how rigid and compartmentized everything is. Did you investigate letting the Phoenix
    emerge from the O. That way you could loose the rules and loosen up the design
    so It can vary to circumstances of use.  <BR> <BR>An aside: Why are all the logos
    I&#39;m seeing lately here justified? Is Justifing the lines making it a logo?
    What I feel is you need to create a corporate or business idenity and make it
    flexible enough that it works in all your busniness environments. Then make the
    mark or logo fit the business scheme. It seems lately the opposite is true.'

  body: Our company also has an unwieldy registered name, so we use the &#39;snappy&#39;
    name in the logo, and put the full name in the address block of our stationery
    etc. Would that be an option to solve the &#39;SPI INC&#39; problem? <BR> <BR>I
    share Daniel&#39;s thoughts about the risks of &#39;designing yourself into a
    corner&#39;. You need to think about all the possible future applications of your
    logo and the potential problems of adapting your logo to them. <BR> <BR>BTW, I
    noticed from your profile that you&#39;re also a tattoo artist. I read a great
    thread here about tattoos last year that might interest you, if you haven&#39;t
    already read it. I can&#39;t seem to find it, though.

  body: Another vote for version B, although the placement of &#34;SPI Inc.&#34; is
    killing me. Maybe move it below the rule
