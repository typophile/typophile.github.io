  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All -- 

The project is an 8-page corporate editorial-style newsletter. 8.5 x 11" page, three-column grid, serif typeface (9.5 point Sabon on 13 points leading), ragged-right alignment. 

The client has got some bug up her @$5 that "hyphens are bad in all circumstances" and has directed that no words shall ever be hyphenated. Ever. 

Now, I understand that it's bad form to allow hyphens in headlines. Subheads. Deckheads. Maybe even pull quotes. But... eliminate all hyphens from the body copy? This is going to make for a rather awkward rag (at the best) or a lot of time spent walking the lines trying to fix the rag. 

Anyone ever had this request? I'm sure there's gotta be some readability study out there that I can point to that proves hyphens -- when used sparingly in body copy -- actually help readability. 

Thoughts?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">What is the measure? I prefer to avoid hyphens and consequently do spend a lot of time going over the rag at the end of a job. You are not the only one to have had the request.

Depending on your content and the size of your gutter, yes, it might be a problem, but it might not either.  If you've got a narrower gutter and wider columns, and most words under 11 letters, it may well not be one.

I set ragged-right text without hyphens very often, and no one has complained about readability, so you probably can't use that at a rationale.... </div>

Not to start a Typo-L-style mess, but the least problematic
solution I've heard of is to use the logical-not character.

With ragged setting, I've seen "no hyphens," "no more than two hyphens in a row" (a usual hyphen block in justified copy is more than three), "don't hyphenate after two only letters," and on & on. On the other hand, some specify "tight ragg." A few want lines to have a pattern of "long, short, long, short." Those are the only ones I tell to find another typesetter.

People have all sorts of theories on what is easier to read. I use to have them, too. But I can read a book & enjoy it & forget my profession. So on a number of occasions, after finishing a book, I went back to look at the hyphenation that had been used. Most of them broke all sorts of my pet rules, & I finally had to admit most of these rules are a matter of what people (including me) used to feel more professional; they had nothing to do with <cite>reading.</cite>

One thing people often seem to forget is that all composition is compromise. Hyphenation aids even spacing -- between words in justified copy, at line ends in ragged copy. Unless you write & rewrite the copy to fit the space, limiting one increased the amount of the other.

One of my favorite PE's was "PE, loose line; PE, hyphenated word." Both PE's referring to the same line. The hyphenated word was a long one, and all agreed it wasn't going to come up. So to banish the hyphen, the line perforce had to get even looser. Where do they think loose space space comes from?

There is also a fun situation with 18th century composition. Apparently, some felt the reader might get lost if a word hyphenated overleaf. So, if that happened, they would set the complete word on the line below that last line; the reader would then have the whole word. Next, someone got the idea that even if the word wasn't hyphenated, the reader might get lost, so they set the next word (that occurred overleaf) on the line below. Apparently someone finally figured out that the logical end to that was to set the whole rest of the chapter on the line(s) below, which wasn't going to work, so they stopped this nonsense. Today, with people reading while listening to music & maybe watching television simultaneously, this argument ("the reader will get confused") has little merit.

My initial read was that this person was used to fixing on the no-hyphens. I just worked with it and kicked it back for small re-writes to fix the worst problems. It still isn't as good as it could have been with a few selective hyphens, but as stated above, with the right measure you can work it out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm...  I did several projects with a client that said, "Our headline face is Torino." 

To me, it sounds like much the same thing. I don't happen to have many relationships with clients that I would describe as adversarial, although I admit -- they do sometimes exist.

In the end, I think (and this is my personal take) that both designer <em> and </em> client have a stake of ownership (for want of a better term) of a project, but perhaps the greater stake must belong to the client; it's to they that designers hope to give a voice, and it's also they who will either be served or not with the design. 

If you work at an office where the boss says, "No bolo ties," I think it's a losing position to declare that bolos, are, in fact, the accessory that asserts your freedom of expression. The boss has an overall image they are hoping to project, and if that one look doesn't fit into the definition, as they see it, them so be it.

Anyway, I'm rambling.

Any designer can work without hyphens, if they need to.</div>

Sry I missed the original. This is right on though. Most of human actions don't rise above the basic pissing and sniffing we are so fond of. To elevate the discussion to the betterment of the communication and function is limited by the lack of social intelligence.

To add a little more complexity, I believe the person I was working with was demonstrating to me her methods of dominating the in-house designer she was used to working with. My experience is that pressure to move in a better direction is best applied consistently over time. I'm sure my explanation of old style characters, which she had assumed were subscript?, did not sit well with her and only strengthened her resolve to not bend on other well established routines. 

Please send me the original comment if it is still to be had.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well part of being a designer is that you are also frequently dealing with people who have a little bit of knowledge about type and/or design, and want to make sure you know that. It is a power game - if they're the client they want to make sure they're getting what they pay for (and that you know you work for them). If they're the client's representative or liaison then they want to prove their importance to the client - make sure the clients believes they are instrumental to the design process. 

I've had all sorts of design rules spouted at me and most of the time, unless it's something I have a serious objection to, I roll with it. Being a difficult designer isn't gonna help you in the long run.</div>

No, it's not like that at all. Everybody, every human being, has some sense of design. It's true that not everybody is a fashion designer, but everybody can put together an ensemble. It's true that not everybody is an interior designer, but everybody can paint four walls or hang posters.

The profession of dentistry has nothing to do with design. So it's more like going a hair stylist and telling him what to do and how to do it. And that happens all the time.

That's quite a strong statement; seemingly hyperbole, and calls into question your fashion sense.

But unfortunately there are many people out there that they think they can outsmart the dentist. Of course they’re the ones that end up with “worst teeth”.</em>

Apologies to everyone for taking this Off-topic.

Litera - I learnt from a wonderful GP in New York to question every doctor I go/speak to. I'm glad I do it -- sometimes without thinking. 30 years ago, I went to a dentist on an emergency. He said I needed 2 root canals (because he didn't know which tooth was bothering me, and it wasn't clear on the x-rays). I said thank you, but no thanks. Took something to deaden the pain -- and drove home. The next morning I saw my own dentist. Well, a small bit of food had gone below gumline and was irritating a tooth. He removed it with a good cleaning, and I've never needed the root canals.

So yes, some of us do speak to the dentist - and know to get a second opinion. 

Now you can go back on-topic. I am sorry, but I couldn't let that statement sit there like it's correct. All doctors are human beings - and they do make very human errors. There are no gods among MDs or DDSs -- and one needs to know, not just to ask questions - but which questions. Honestly, I didn't want to help put that other dentist's kids through college.

Hehehe. My project manager calls the old style numerals "floating numbers." And she despises them. Except when she doesn't notice them.

		<div class="commentbody">Theunis, if you track Traffic101 through his/her/its profile, you'll see that the m.o. is to dig up some long dormant thread, post some vaguely related one-liner and then link to some forum spam. Sometimes it's pretty subtle, but it's been going on a while now.

I think a moderator should look into this account and verify whether it's a sincere and legitimate person; otherwise, eliminate it.
