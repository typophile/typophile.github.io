body: "I know the Jack Daniels label has been done to death on here but the poster
  adverts have quite a nice antique-looking body text on, which I can't ID.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jdposter_5949.png]\r\n\r\nSorry
  the size is so small. I've looked at LTC Kennerley as I heard JD uses that elsewhere
  in their design but the A doesn't match: serif on the top of the A in the poster
  but not in Kennerley. Also the serifs look bigger in Kennerley in general.\r\n\r\nOther
  features which stick out are the diagonal bar of the e, a straight tail on the y
  and the 3 terminal W."

  body: "I think you're on the right track with Goudy as the type designer, but Kennerley
    is not what this ad uses. I think this is a version of his Italian Old Style.
    The Lanston version sold by P22/LTC, called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-italian-old-style/|LTC
    Italian Oldstyle]] seems very close, unlike the Monotype version of this typeface
    (W wrong for starters). Judith Sutcliffe did one called Italian Electric, based
    on this Goudy typeface, and hers is also a better match than the Monotype version.
    Richard Beatty has also done some Goudy revivals, and he may have done this one
    too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Awesome. I think the Goudy one is right. I took a better picture of one of
    the other posters yesterday:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jdposter2_3816.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    c terminal is more rounded in the Goudy face, which seems to match the poster
    better. Those two faces are very similar though ... Maybe the Goudy is a slightly
    more consistent colour in blocks of text."
