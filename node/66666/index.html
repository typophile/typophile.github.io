Start sketching things that remind you of the city and of commerce. Brainstorming on paper really helps me. Or maybe ask your client what they had in mind, what logos they've seen that are appealing to them. Study other chamber of commerce logos so you can decide if you want to be the same or different.</div>

As for retaining parts of the old logo, you'd probably better ask them. Or just design a few completely new ones, and a few with elements retained from the old logo. I mean, for a project like this, you'll most likely present several different concepts anyway?</div>

To me, the seal just needs updating. I like the background guilloche pattern that's currently in the seal, so I'd look for a way to keep that feel to it. 

My starting point would probably be to pull the text down and arrange it on multiple lines, horizontally centered under the mark, which I'd keep as a circular medallion floating above the text. From there, I'd play around with each of the elements to see if other orientations might work.</div>

The reason I know this is because I read their "about us" pdf on their site. Plus, they bought land from the native american at a really low price, which might indicate they took advantage of natives.

		<div class="commentbody">The community plays a huge part in the chamber and its people that keep it running whether it be business people or people that work at the chamber. The seal also has to be done away with, according to the head of the chamber its dated and involves too much history of the town, history that has to deal with slaves and farming which is far from what south windsor is like today. The seal looks like its from the 1800s (Which it probably is) and even with a revamp the same message will still be delivered. plus it get pretty illegible when shrunk down, especially with the cross hatching background. They want something clean, sophisticated and memorable and obviously something that can be resized, faxed and copied easily and still retain clarity. Small detailed drawings might not be the way to go. I do however like the seal but after speaking to them about it they don't want to revamp it, they want to get rid of it.</div>
