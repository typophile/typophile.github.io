body: "Hello, everyone!\r\n\r\nI need help identifying this type used on The September
  Issue. It was used for the names during the movie and on the end credits. I thought
  it was a really nice serif font with a bit of a nice odd touch with the capital
  'C', which had like a small bulb hanging by the top end instead of a serif. They
  also appear on the ends of the capital 'S'.\r\n\r\nI did a search already but wasn't
  able to find an existing post.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample
  picture.\r\n"
