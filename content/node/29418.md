body: "From a paperback, apparently (from the punctuation) typeset in England but
  published here in the 1960s...the italics and oldstyle figures look like Bembo,
  but the roman looks much funkier and if digitized would be a wonderful alternative
  to the more formal Monotype Bembo. Note the slanted hyphens and many other kinks
  and oddities. Has this or something very like it been digitized?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olderBembo_6477.gif]"

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nIf it's of interest, Poliphilus/Blado (they're meant as companions
    even with different names) were designed to mimic ink squash, so they do have
    this irregularity built into them, kind of an \"antique\" finish. They're also
    much less delicate than the original Bembo digitization, so they're very well
    suited to offset printing. A possible benefit is that Poliphilus is probably more
    economical than Bembo. The family is small, but at this point, unique."

  body: "Thanks Carl, I did try out my Monotype digitized versions, which unfortunately
    are cleaner and lighter than my metal sample above, and thus very close to Centaur
    and Adobe Jenson. If Monotype were smart, considering the market interest in funky
    Renaissance faces, they would meet the Adobe competition by creating a unified
    P/F family, with easy keyboard link to the italic and, of course, with oldstyle
    figures loaded. Right now, all desirable options require manual switching: bor-ring!
    \r\n\r\nIt's so interesting what you say about mimicking ink squash. Fonts that
    address this period really should be a shade heavier and less delicate...the best
    entrant right now is Dupr\xE9's funky, robust Zingha, with that fabulous lower
    case a!"

    wrong with using a font program to rename the font from <em>Blado</em> to <em>Poliphilus
    Italic</em>?"
