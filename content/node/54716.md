  body: "Some of the more upscale fashion magazines use Bodoni for the masthead--Elle,
    Fashion Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue are a few you may wish to check out for
    examples. I used to get the funniest looks from women when I was sitting in the
    airport scanning through an issue of Harper's Bazaar to check out the type treatments
    and page layouts ... :-)\r\n\r\nGood luck with your project.\r\n\r\nWynne Hunkler\r\n<a
