  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all,

I have just been assigned to produce an essay on ethical design for college and i would be interested to know your views for my research. I would be very grateful if you could assist me by answering the following questions or by giving me any opinions that you have:

Whether you are prepared to design for charities for free or if you would demand a fee? 

Would you design for a firm that goes against your own personal beliefs? Or is money more important to you than your beliefs?

Any response would be much appreciated! Thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Q1. I too do a lot of volunteer work for charities and create for them. However, some are prosperous and wouldn't allow me to design for free (thank you!!!) but I charge them flat rates and much less than I would one of my not-for-profit customers.

Q2. I once designed for a small company in NY - they wanted a rip-off Nike logo. I felt so bad that day, I couldn't sleep -- and when they came in the next day to pick up the work - I asked them to leave. I remember one guy pulling out dollar bills - and I told him it wasn't about the money. I felt that I had sunk so low. I just couldn't live with myself. I do remember I had my office door open when I asked them to leave, and the business next door heard my pleas -- and came in to "help" out. We were a very friendly building on E. 44th St. But that's off-topic.

What is difficult about your question - is most won't know until they are in that situation. Mine came when the end of typesetting shops was near -- I had payroll, bluecross and so many other expenses to consider, it is why I even talked to those jokers. But in the end, I just couldn't do it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have done and will continue to do work for charities that I believe in. I get leary when solicited by strangers though. It is sad that there are con-men out there who scam people by pretending to be charities.
I would not do any work for shady outfits. I am not clear on what is meant by "against my beliefs". It would be a case by case thing. If it bothered me, I would not do it. I do not believe in any religion but would not turn down work for a religious group. I don't believe in suntan shops and think they are silly but I would not turn down work for them. I would certainly turn down work for racist or hate groups and for gun lobby groups like the NRA. Certainly forget any criminal or sleezy work.

The litmus test is, would I be willing to show my kids the work.

Not sure what the ethical slant on that question is. Doesn't seem to be an ethical-centric question to me.

But, the answer, of course, is 'it depends'. ;0)

"Would you design for a firm that goes against your own personal beliefs? Or is money more important to you than your beliefs?"

I think there's two angles to take:

 - pick and choose your work and only work for companies you feel meet your moral and ethical standards

 - accept the fact that we are a commercial service provider and that the goal is to give the customer the best of what they ask for independant of any moral and ethical standards of the company.

The latter is more akin to law. A lawyer is committed to representing the client regardless of their moral and ethical views of the person.

I don't think either one is more wrong/right than the other.

		<div class="commentbody">another angle on these very good questions is the overall issue of what we are a part of: consumerism and disposability, the commodification of desire, the impact of the products and services we help to promote, the creation and maintenance of identity-based illusions: coolness, hipness, cleanly drawn facades, etc.  i feel there may be no clear answer to these questions; only debate, controversy, survival issues, the inevitable politics of the free market, and the infinite complexities of culture itself.

but the extent to which we participate, select, and respond might make a difference.

recommended reading: "captains of consciousness" by stuart ewen. "commodify your dissent" and "the conquest of cool" by thomas frank. "no logo" by naomi klein. "emotional branding" by marc gobe. 

i am not endorsing the opinions in any of these books. i recommend them as food for thought.</div>

That's not a good analogy. Lawyers often represent people who appear to be just this side of pure evil, only to be exonerated through something the lawyer turns up, sometimes after a conviction. Designers are in a very different position; designers don't defend people accused of committing unethical acts, designers <em>become complicit</em> in said acts. The designers behind Joe Camel and the Kool penguin made a lot more effort to sell cigarettes to kids than the tobacco executives, whom simply provided the funding and collected the profits. The law firms that represented the tobacco companies only got involved after the fact.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Q1. Depends: if I've approached them because I'm already a supporter and I'd like to help, I look at it as my volunteer contribution.  If they approach me out of the blue like any other client, I might do it for a reduced fee if I sympathize with their cause.  If I don't sympathize with their cause, I would either say no or refer them to someone else if I thought they might want to get involved.

Q2. I don't take money for work/causes that violate my sense of ethics. Had to once when I was young and desperately poor, and was sucked into something that morphed into a situation that was borderline illegal and spent a lot of money getting my name off it.  Never again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. My last design job was working for next to nothing a nonprofit whose ideas I supported passionately. It's one of the shining starts of the nonprofit world, and dozens of people work there, for free, year round. They took advantage of me, treated me like crap, and from here on out I'm following Sagmeister's idea: nonprofits I like get a discount, but nothing free, because if they're not paying they have little reason to care about a designer or his/her work. 

2. It all depends on the client. Clients that really do shirk their responsibilities, such as Exxon refusing to pay for cleaning up oil spills, are definitely out. Work that's just blatantly wrong, like tobacco advertising, is also out. But I would happily do work for Kraft foods, even though it is part of Altria, because there's a big difference in selling food and selling addictive carcinogens. To paraphrase Chris, I wouldn't do anything that I won't be proud to show to my potential kids.</div>

I think that's a very good point.

In the end, as 'commercial artists' we're really an essential part of the consumerist machine. That, alone, has it's own set of ethics to consider.

I once did a web site for a national bank's Political Action Committee. I didn't agree with supporting their cause politically, but I got a lot out of providing them with a web site that met there needs that they were thrilled with. Depending on how wide/narrow you focus your 'ethics lens' on a project can make a huge difference in how you perceive the project.

Would I do another web site for a corporate PAC? I don't know. 

"Altria"

A great example of Point of View.

Is Altria the ultimate American company? Giving the masses what they truly want: Tobacco, beer and processed cheese? Or are they pure evil? ;o)

"Situational morality is the bane of western civilization."

It's what our civilization was built upon! ;o)</div>

I'll go with "it depends." How poor am I, what's the charity, and how much work is involved?

<cite>Would you design for a firm that goes against your own personal beliefs?</cite>

If the firm went far enough against my personal beliefs, I wouldn't work for them. Even in a full-time job situation, I have discovered that there are things I could be asked to do that I would say "no" to, for ethical reasons. If that means risking getting fired, or (in some extreme case) quitting, I'd be willing to do that.

Of course, I speak from the comfortable position of having a good income and some savings and so on. I am not about to judge people who take work for clients they are less comfortable with because they feel that's what they need to do just to make a living. I'm just grateful that I don't have to make those kinds of choices.

The parallel to the legal system doesn't do much for me, btw. The legal system is predicated on lawyers taking cases for people who are or may be guilty. I don't think the universe of design and typography would fall apart if designers and typographers followed their conscience in accepting clients.

		<div class="commentbody">thanks to paul cutler for the correction: "commodify your dissent" is an anthology edited by thomas frank and matt weiland.

as for charity work, my own guidelines are as follows: i never work for free. i think it's a bad precedent. but in certain cases i have exchanged services for specific things: a membership, the right to stipulate a specific and visible credit, or enough creative freedom to assure a portfolio piece for me (which can be worth more than a fee), but even then i work at cost.

if a charity or not-for-profit can't meet me there i try to refer them to someone else, usually younger and hungrier...

on topic:

Like I stated in another thread - I'll work for free for my Mom or if it's just a bunch of creatives having fun - like the type challenges here.

Charities are well funded and in most of them the money goes into administration. Non-profits are the same. If a charity that I believed in could show me the numbers indicating that almost all of the monies collected went to the cause - I would consider it.

#2 All firms of any size go against my beliefs somewhere so the answer is yes.

#3 If money was more important to me than my beliefs then my belief is I would be rich. So no.

Life is not black and white. I take things on a case by case basis…

I don't really do that but don't mind donating my time or design skills - again for the right cause.

I think it's a symptom of the times. Economic populism is seeing a resurgence both from politicians looking for easy votes (John Edwards, Hugo Chavez) and media outlets looking for quick ratings (CNN). This leads back to the old altruism is good, everything else is profiteering mindset, under which nonprofits are saintly and anyone actually trying to <em>earn</em> money is, at best, suspect. Given how badly America has been screwed by phoney economic conservatives in the last six years, it isn't entirely surprising or unwarranted.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>Whether you are prepared to design for charities for free or if you would demand a fee?</cite>

For free only if it's something I not only believe in, but have total creative control over. The charities must agree on a a quick thumbnail sketch I do on-site. No revisions allowed afterwards unless it's something critical (such as the date for a flyer changing). They are allowed to request what details they want in the beginning, but not after I start the job. 

Example: I designed flyers for the local firemen who had a fundraising event to buy new equipment. This was immediately following 9-11. They gave me full creative control and lots of respect and appreciation, and they got a great flyer. The only changes made were adding some program times. 

What was only intended to be an overnight illustration freebie wound up becoming one of the most talked-about portfolio pieces I've ever had, and it actually helped me get work at one point (the employer had friends at NYFD).

<cite>Would you design for a firm that goes against your own personal beliefs? Or is money more important to you than your beliefs?</cite>

That depends on how much it goes against your beliefs and how much you are willing to compromise to make a living. If it's something I wouldn't be proud to show to anyone, there's no use doing it.

I turned down an offer to design a web site selling pornographic materials. I did not seek out the work. I had done completely unrelated artwork for one of the company's investors, and that apparently led him to ask me if I'd be interested in doing the job. The money offered for the work was awful hard to ignore, but I just couldn't do something like that.</div>

What really irks me is that this is so much more of a problem with the visual arts than with many other fields. Why is it that so many people who can see the importance of art and design don't want to pay for it, but those same people don't even think about asking a plumber or electrician to work for free? It seems that the idea that artist don't need money is rooted in the leftist fine art world and its cult of genius, but given how little interest in, or respect for contemporary fine art people appear to have, why are they still carrying around the notion of the starving artist who only deserves a payoff after a lifetime of privation?</div>

our commitment to a personal quality standard is hard to quantify, and often what we end up with looks "easy". perhaps people don't see graphics the way they hear music. generally they don't see the same level of expertise and practice behind the product.

i work mainly in motion graphics and broadcast design. almost every piece i produce requires music. it has amazed me for years that composers usually get (small) royalties everytime the piece goes on the air - on top of their original composition fee - but my payment is one shot, end of story. or is it because they have a union ?</div>

I was referring to the leftist side of fine arts that perpetuates on the belief that artists are better off spending their lives in poverty while  trying to generate some wild new concept than they are just making work that people actually want to buy. These are the old hippies in schools and museums who scowl every time an artist who makes a good living from commercial work walks by.

Regarding musicians, isn't part of the reason that they don't get paid well that there are more of them out there then there are jobs? Musicians are like comic book artists—only the famous ones can make much money, because there are hundreds of people begging to get those jobs.</div>

well, i get your idea but i don't think this generalization is really accurate. most of the art students i know want to be rich and famous art stars. the market is driven by rich collectors who i suspect are not exactly "lefty hippies". i think the conflict is more theoretical: the pretense of "fine art" vs. commercial art, but it's not strictly about money or poverty.
i've also noticed more and more gallery artists contributing (selling) their work to pop cultural design - especially CD covers. i'll try and collect some examples. later. gotta work.</div>

One of the sad parts is that part of the oppression of artists comes from people like gallery owners, who tell artists that they can't make their work too expensive or "no one will buy it."  

A gallery owner who's selling some of my work suggested that I price my items at one level, whether it's in his window or I'm selling directly to clients. Well, if I charge $40, there's a big difference between getting that directly or paying him 40% off the top.  

OTOH, if I don't price my work so that I can at least break even on supplies and pay myself something reasonable as an hourly wage, why would I bother even trying to sell it in the first place?  </div>

I have done work gratis, for green groups.
Charity starts at home: SOTA (organizer of Typecon) is a non-profit organization which would not be possible without volunteers. The same is true of many industry organizations. However, there is "payback" in non-monetary ways -- but the same is true of all pro bono work.

@ Thomas <em>The legal system is predicated on lawyers taking cases for people who are or may be guilty.</em> 

In my time I have retained Corporate lawyers, IP lawyers, and Real Estate lawyers. All of which were hired to protect my ideas and designs.

New York in 2007, where it is virtually impossible to find an affordable apartment anywhere you'd want to live and the overhyped art world is dominated by vast international fairs, white box galleries and collectors, is a wildly different place than NY of the 70s and 80s when artists lived in subsidized lofts in SoHo and there was an energetic and experimental cross pollination between the various art disciplines. And you could visit all the major galleries in an afternoon! Today's art stars seem unfortunately, to be the gallerists and guest curators, not the artists themselves.

IMHO it'll take a major economic downturn and the wallstreeters moving onto the next big thing before the art scene in NY recaptures it's vibrance. I'm glad I was young & idealistic (and broke) in a different era!</div>

Nevertheless, I can affect my ethics regardless of the source of any funds, and make the purchasers aware of that. In order ensure !Exclamachine's agenda is funded, 5% off the top goes to Sabre International, and more goes to supporting Typosium and another non-profit project, along with a considerable amount of time.

If AcmeWorldCorp Inc. wants what I offer, they can buy my world view with it.

America is good for the advancements of the arts only through strength in numbers. I know too many proud citizens who have never been to any show but SFMOMA's "The Art of Star Wars". The general tendency of many Americans only to respect financial success, to shun elitism, and to choose casual individuation paired with from-the-hip analysis makes it a poor spawning ground of high culture. But dang if there aren't enough of us to have an impact anyway.</div>

I like fine art and the process of creating it, but it's not as fun for me as designing commercial art for the masses. I'm sure that sounds shallow/dull/uninspired, but in truth I actually thrive working under the corporate umbrella. My heart is in that kind of work and the fun part for me is seeing how far I can push the limitations I'm given... yes, I am a silent design rebel in starched clothing. :-) And that is the statement that I wish to make, and I make it almost every time.

One lady I did design work with had spent some time illustrating shoes and furniture for store catalogs (I believe Sears Roebuck, IIRC). She was one of the best fine artists I'd ever worked with, and of course with the abilities she had, drawing shoes was a very narrow scope of her talents. I never considered her as some kind of corporate sell-out or someone who compromised her beliefs for cash. She was simply making a living and it certainly didn't affect her ideals or her talents. She taught me so much.</div>

It's great that you've been assigned this as a subject (judging from the clouds of ethical dust this post has stirred up); I don't know when you have to have it done by, but my tuppence worth on this subject would include <a href="http://www.papress.com/bookpage.tpl?isbn=1568985827&cart=117101787221725">Fresh Dialogue 6: Friendly Fire,</a> convened by James Victore for the AIGA and published by Princeton Architectural Press. A very interesting read.

To answer your questions
1. I did work for free and/or volunteer assignments for the charities and non-profits I supported when I was a student in London. It was a privilege (I also worked for some of them on a salaried basis, but not as a designer. That was just work). These days I would charge a fee – if only to avoid the faffing-around factor.
2. To do something you don't believe in for the sake of money is to relegate yourself to the point of prostitution, whatever your line of work is. Having said that, I've done commercial work that was 'less than noble' because the noble thing to do at the time was pay my bills and feed my family. But I've never put myself in the position of having to fire a client outright on ethical grounds.

		<div class="commentbody">1. I've donated time to charities for work, and write it off at the end of the year. My mom runs one, so it's kind of expected that I do something for her when asked. I never mind. I've also done work for a few no-profits while working in a studio and some of them really take everything to the nth degree and it's torture. 

2. What I find morally unacceptable and the work I do have not crossed paths. I've come up against unethical and that's enough for me to walk away from a project, however.

I'm sure you already know, but professional organizations like AIGA and GDC provide ethical guidelines for designers as well, which is worth checking out, if only to have another view of 'ethics'.</div>
