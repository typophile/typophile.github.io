  body: "I don't mean to offend, but it's pretty illegible.  The O looks like a G;
    the L looks like a K; the K looks like an arrow, and the floating part made me
    wonder if it was a lower-case i.  Only the D is easily recognizable as a D, although
    you might get away with the S if everything else were more clear.  As it is, when
    I first looked at it, I thought it said GKdSiKGGK.  It took a bit of effort to
    decipher.\r\n\r\nIf I didn't have to read it, though, I'd say it looks nice.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps."

  body: "I think the treatment and colors are cool -- and I like the general feel
    -- but I also agree that you shoul increase legibility. There are lots of logos
    in this style and I think it would be good to look at some comparison examples.
    The Los Logos book series is packed with marks like this.\r\n\r\nWas this drawn
    from scratch?"

    then keep clicking on \"Suprise Me\" like 100 times and eventually you will see
    much of the book. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, I noticed that a lot of the best layouts
    aren't available to view at amazon. Sometimes you just gotta throw down and buy
    it or go search it out at a bookstore. There are used copies of this book for
    $10 at Amazon."

    it by hovering over the image of the book:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/surprise_me1_6463.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nOr

  body: "aric have you read the book there is not many pages available; however i
    like what i see. \r\n\r\njust a qesution so a good rule of thumb is start with
    a 3 by 3 grid sstem  9 squares is this known as the rule of thirds.\r\n\r\nSo
    this does apply to any sized paper a3 a4 as elam uses a square and a4 is not square???\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I got about 20 different pages of surprise me. You really gotta keep on clicking,
    because it's not really random. They hide pages in there. Literally, click like
    50+ times to see all of them.\r\n\r\nIf you want conventional grids, start with
    Making and Breaking the Grid or Grid Systems by Muller-Brockmann.\r\n\r\nThe Elam
    books are more about showing the wide range of possibilities (applicable to publishing,
    as well as fine art).\r\n\r\nIf you need to find specific advice for a specific
    project, you should look to contemporary, real-world examples.\r\n\r\nIs there
    a specific project you need a grid for? "
