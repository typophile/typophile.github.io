  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have been recently hired to create the layout for a couple of websites for a high profile university research group (don’t ask why, I really don’t have much experience in webdesign). The programmer is giving me a hard time because the only person he listens to is Mr. Jacob Nielsen. My main concern is to make the reading experience as comfortable as possible ON SCREEN so that the user doesn’t even dream about printing the page and wasting paper.</p>
<p>A part from considerations about the right typeface etc. do you have any information about column width? For big chunks of text, how long should the text column be? I don’t like the idea of wide chunks of text as I don’t find particularly comfortable moving my eyes (and neck) from left to right all the time when I read. The programmer wants to keep the text line very wide because he assumes people will want to print. I’m sorry if I’m not explaining it very well but I would be grateful if you could point me to interesting links on this issue, or websites that encourage people to read on screen rather than print and how to make things more comfortable for the reader.</p>
<p>We are designing one site with EZ Publish and another one with Moodle, anyone has an opinion on these?
I know there are tons of stuff on the web but I’m not sure which one is the most reliable and I dislike that J. Nielsen. In fact I know there’s been a discussion on him back in 2002 on Typophile but it was mainly about Flash. Thank you so much as usual.</p>

<p>Groan. But be gentle with him, and you might just awaken a sensitivity to what Nielsen is blind to. Maybe send him to us. You might encourage him by pointing out that some of us (including yours truly) are actually programmers [too].</p>

<p>One should also assume that people will <cite>read</cite> the printout&hellip; Long line lengths are in fact more damaging in print than onscreen, because reading in print has a much better chance of getting more immersive. Try explaining that the gap between lines has to be larger the longer the lines, to ensure good &ldquo;line returns&rdquo;, and that ends up wasting just as much space. And if you&rsquo;re not going to use CSS to increase leading you&rsquo;re sort of naturally channeled into a maximum line-length value.</p>

If you&rsquo;re ambitious, try two columns.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all, the great thing about the web is you can design the page to look different on paper than it does on screen. Use a print style sheet for that.</p>
<p>If the text is inevitably long, just assume folks will print it. The screen is great for scanning long texts, not so great for reading long texts.</p>
<p>Yes, line length is important. About the only way to control that on screen is to layout your columns of text using ems as measurements. That way, if the type increases/decreases in size, so will the column, thereby preserving the line lenght. Of course, if a person happens to need large time, but still wants a narrow browser, then things get hard for them.</p>
<p>So&hellip;I&rsquo;d set a width for your column using ems, and then set a max-width in pixels (to something like 700 pixels or so) to accomodate those that need big type but don&rsquo;t want to deal with horizontal scrolling.</p>

I have also increased leading by the programmer has encountered difficulties doing this with EZpublish. Not sure the problem is with him or with EZpublish yet.
I think I&rsquo;ll go through all the links and try to write something consistent to show them.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;d like to quickly weigh-in on this topic.</p>
<p>Though I have both a strong background in print and on-screen design, I am becoming more and more in favor of letting the individual user determine their preference of reading mode.</p>
<p>We should no longer think of web design as static, and we should make every attempt at allowing the user to have more control on how and when the information is to be assimilated.</p>
<p>[[Roger Black]] discusses user selectable column layout in a recent <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18650/" target="new">Technology Review</a> article. For purely onscreen reading, I, for one, would love to see user selectable screen font styles with adjustable spacing and column widths.

<p>Do note, however, that screen width != browser viewport width. They are two different things.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>lore&hellip;yes, stats are important, and something that is very much what design is about. That said, keep in mind that a lot of web stats are very much red herrings. Again, screen resolution is not the key issue. The size of the browser viewport is the key stat, and one that is very often not tracked at all. Yes, a lot of people will have their browser maximized, but there are a number of exceptions: those with side panels open, those with huge monitors that browser with multiple windows side-by-side, mac users, and power users who actually take advantage of modern multi-windowed OSes by having multiple windows open.</p>
<p>As for CMS, it depends entirely on the template engine they decide to implement. Most are really crappy. Few support true CSS layout and few support basic concepts like valid HTML. The best bet is to find a CMS that does not even try to implement a template engine allowing you and your developers to make your own templates from scratch.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m sure you agree that you can&rsquo;t please everybody. In web design, I think
saying &ldquo;bye bye&rdquo; to the bottom 10% or so is not so bad. I tend to consider the way
left-handers, who are about 15% of the population, need &ldquo;special attention&rdquo; in
some things (and they know they need it). Although in other ways (like tennis)
they actually have an advantage.</p>

<p>True, though the web allows you to accomodate most everyone if you&rsquo;re willing. Granted, accomodate and please aren&rsquo;t necessarily the same thing.</p>
<p>For instance, you could easily (try to) please a majority by assuming that a majority of users with the most common screen resolution maximize their browser and optimize your layout for that specific situation, but then let your site shrink or expand to fit those browsers outside the norm.</p>
