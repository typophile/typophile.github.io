  body: There&#39;s a LOT more you can do than just posters. Packaging, billboards,
    web sites, logos, brochures, books, manuals, POP, signage, environmental graphics,
    fleet graphics, menus, direct mail, motion graphics, bus ads, infographics, kiosks,
    forms, invites, letterheads, gifts, stationery, typefaces, icons, interfaces,
    cd packaging, etc.
