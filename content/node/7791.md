body: This Old English type of Font was found on Sports Uniforms.  Very likely the
  &#34;Champion&#34; brand of Uniform.  This sample is from a photgraph taken in the
  late 1970&#39;s or early 1980&#39;s.  This Font was likely used for decades before
  and probably after. <BR> <BR>Can anyone Identify the Font Name or Font Foundary
  for this and if it is available to purchase? <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/54058.jpg"

  body: Well, apparently there will be No &#34;Magic&#34; matching this Old English-like
    font this time. <BR> <BR>It is a personal favorite of mine and I was really hoping
    to find this one- maybe one day? <BR> <BR>Thanks to Mike and any others who did
    research on this sample but could not find an &#34;exact&#34; or &#34;closer match&#34;
    and therefore didn&#39;t have anything to post.  The time you may have put into
    it is appreciated nonetheless. <BR> <BR>Tom
