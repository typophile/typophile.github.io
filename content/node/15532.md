body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI`ve created a fashion logostyle for a young fashion designer,\r\nwho
  is oriented for men and women clothing. From briefing this identity must \r\nreflect
  classines, fashionableness. Must be wearable, but not quirky and not \r\ntoo high
  luxury. For the understanding \"fuchs\" is in german fox, so I tried\r\nto avoid
  typical association of logo with fox. I plan fox-heraldy-sign for\r\na monogram
  or for jeans-sub-brand, where fox is in the right place I think :o) \r\nSo I`m ready
  to be beaten with critics and would be happy to get some \r\ntips and ideas. How
  good is kerning? Color is replaceable."

  body: perfect fits the genre, technically the s looks too wide, the accent looks
    too big, and i don't think the ligature is necessary, it doesn't relate to the
    logotype; the unusual f is enough in 'cf'.

  body: "Yes Miles, I see now the accent is to0 definitive. It have to be discreet.
    I modificated accident grotesk extended`s \"F\" to avoid reading \"f...s\", that
    we get at small sizes and fast looks. :o) After that, the result of ligature must
    adumbrate the infinity sign, that signified the christine`s vision how clothing
    have to be. But if that don`t occured, then I go wrong way. Thank you for precise
    tips.\r\n\r\nOne thing you must confess... Are you Miles Newlyn, the owner of
    http://newlyn.com ? Then you are my logo-god! Your \"3\" is number one in my logolist
    and \"ish\", \"unilever\" top 10. Respect. My answer to your logostyle, better
    to say the try, you can see here: http://www.kahlkopf.com/deu/vita .\"Kahlkopf\"
    means skinhead in german. So it was near idea to create skined and nacked \"K\",
    but what could stand infinite times without boring."

  body: "Yup, it's him.  :-)\r\n\r\nMy only comment on the \"cf\" is that the join\r\nis
    too dark - it needs some gradual thinning\r\ntowards the end of the \"c\" stroke.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, big thanks. It`s something on Akzidenz Grotesk, that old drawn type,
    it`s a bit unclean and unbalanced. Wikipedia says, that accent has to be setted
    in 40\xB0 angle, not 45\xB0 like bevor. Here all 4 tips of homework:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kahlkopf.com/files/cf2.gif"

  body: I think the logo is fine loose enough to be embrodered but I think the pink
    is too femine for a mens wear line. You might just consider using it in black
    and white for the mens wear division.

    body: "Yes you right Dan, the colour is actually too feminine. The owner of this
      brand, christine fuchs will decide for colours in her collection, but black-grey-wite
      combination masters every situation.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.christinefuchs.com  for
      last fine details."
