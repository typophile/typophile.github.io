  body: Loucks, you&#39;ll have better luck if you post your sample as a JPG or GIF.

    <BR> <BR>Looks like a Jenson crossed with a Century. It&#39;s not Parkinson, or

  body: It looks a lot like italian old style but the sample I posted looks a tad
    condensed. Thanks for better linking my image. I didn&#39;t catch that while saving
    it photoshop

  body: 'I tried writing another response to this during the &#39;down time&#39;,
    so now that you&#39;re back I&#39;ll repeat it:  Veronese is very close but as
    the sample below shows, it is not exactly identical &#40;RR Veronese Book is the
    bottom sample&#41;. The sample looks like it is a thinner weight, the serifs are
    longer than Veronese Book, and the eye of the &#39;e&#39; isn&#39;t the same shape.
    It&#39;s almost like Steve Jackaman&#39;s adaptation of the font from the TP Collection
    &#40;the stated source&#41; is just a bit heavier. <BR> <BR>Even so, I can&#39;t
    disagree that Veronese is at least based on the same font, or vice versa. <BR><img
