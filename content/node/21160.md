    you post :)\r\n\r\nI thought I knew what \"chirography\" means after I was introduced
    to it (and Bouma) by you and John few years ago.  After the past days of discussions
    on Atypi list, I am at lost.  Please redefine it so I can connect (or disconnect)
    to it.  While you are their can you explain \"symbiosis\" and \"parasitism\".
    \ I told you I am a simple guy :)\r\n\r\n-Saad"

      Traveling from New York to Dubai is a big project.  But I would love to attend

    \"[[chirography]]\" after\r\nI get back. \"Symbiosis\" and \"mutual parasitism\"\r\nhowever
    are standard terms in biology: the study\r\nof living things (which to me can
