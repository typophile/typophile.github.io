body: "So I'm attempting to identify a font that appears in the cover graphics on
  the covers and spines of original editions of Everyman's Library. These appeared
  in the 1906-1928 period, incorporated into graphics designed by Reginald Knowles.
  I've tried to find a specific font but to no avail. It is possible this was a font
  designed specifically for the graphics, or a combination of more than one font.
  On the other had, it may be well known, but I can't figure it out, and have not
  found any information online. I have scanned some of the artwork; the artwork looks
  a little rough (gold gilt impressed into a leatherette surface), though it is possible
  this was done intentionally for a rustic look. I've isolated a few lines end removed
  most of the surround artwork. I'm looking to clean up the artwork and lettering
  as part of a project I'm working on, and any help identifying the fot would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\njeff[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample everyman_6473.png]"

  body: "It's possible, looking at it again I see that \"Everyman\" (as in Everyman's
    Library) is a slightly different and more formal font, while the rest of it is
    a little more cassual. If I get the chance I'll post the second line of text tomorrow,
    but it is possible it is hand-done for the original artwork, and I may just have
    to mix and match characters from existing fonts. The tops of the \"L\"s going
    off to the right is something I didn't see in many fonts in my original search...
    I know nothing about fonts myself, but if this is a common thing and has a common
    name, let me know and it might help me identify it. Thanks,\r\n\r\njeff"

  body: "The most similar font I could find was Nick Curtis's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/gandy-dancer-nf/|Gandy
    Dancer NF]], his revival of an old ATF face called Tabard, from 1912. Other sort
    of similar styles were Fonthead's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/el-franco/|El
    Franco]] a recreation of 16th century lettering; and A Scholtz fonts number called
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/figment/|Figment]]. I tried to pick hand-made-looking
    type, like your sample.\r\n\r\nI agree with Dick that the cover lettering you
    posted seems hand-made, possibly a lino cut.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The original scan was from a heavily textured leather-type book cover material,
    so some of the hand-made quality may be a result of that. Of course, since they
    knew it would go onto a heavily textured surface, they probably weren't so worried
    about how perfect the letters were on the original engraving. I'll look at the
    fonts you suggested.\r\n\r\njeff"

  body: "...and of course it's only after I go to all the trouble that I find a reference
    in A Companion to the History of the Book to the hand-lettered titles and art
    of Reginald Knowles. So that answers that question... probably based on a real
    font, but customized to fit the page. Thanks all!\r\n"
