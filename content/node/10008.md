  body: Watch the &amp;. It&#39;s getting too close to the 2nd &#39;Stamps&#39;. Also,
    I&#39;d track the 2nd line just a bit, since the size, weight and caps make it
    seem cramped &#40;to me&#41;. Also, it&#39;ll reinject the nice visual contrast
    from the first set. &#40;in this one it&#39;s too high in the first and not high
    enough in the second&#41; <BR> <BR>To be honest, I prefer the regular weight,
    mainly because the ampersand just seems to play better with the &#39;Stamps&#39;s.
    But it also seems more austere to me. <BR> <BR>I like the rule, but it&#39;s really

  body: 'Much better. I prefer the top one now, as well. Tap the &#39;S&#39; on each
    just a hair closer to the &#39;T&#39;, or loosen the space in the &#39;TAM&#39;
    just a tad to compensate &#40;this may be the best way&#41;. The rule when kerning
    is to find the most difficult spacing pair and match the rest to that. This is
    a minor thing, but will get exaggerated on signage. <BR> <BR>The rule you&#39;re
    using is a bit heavy &#40;1pt, right?&#41; Maybe try a .5pt rule. But it may just
    be too much. See what happens. I agree with Daniel on font in the all caps version,
    too. The &#39;S&#39; and &#39;T&#39; are odd, which is why I prefer the top one
    now. The &#39;T&#39; seems to stand too tall with its vertical serifs. <BR> <BR>Another
    suggestion, which may or may not pan out: try using the small caps for the &#39;attorneys
    at law&#39; with no full caps. Right now, I&#39;m guessing that you&#39;re using
    the full caps version of the regular weight, and the forms are getting very thin.
    This isn&#39;t necessarily bad, but you might be able to get a sturdier logo with
    the SC and still preserve hierarchical contrast &#40;you should track it slightly
    to compensate for the additional color from the heavier strokes&#41;. But, it
    could end up being too similar and look bad, or lose the fine, austere feeling.'

  body: 'If I may: imho the face chosen looks like belonging to a firm from the times
    of Billy the Kid. And although oldfashioned type can implay longevity and trustworthyness,
    I&#39;m afraid this one is beyond that point and plain stale. Moreover the caps
    are almost twice the height of the small caps, which is visually disturbing to
    me. I think the &#34;ATTORNEYS etc&#34; has become too small in relation to the
    name and thus too light in color. In the all casp version the ampersand seems
    a little too light, in the small caps version the name looks a bit &#39;fat&#39;,
    unelegant, unclassical. I hope you understand this is all meant to get you ahead.
    Hopefully you can out it to good use...'

  body: No, I don&#39;t. It seems really quite distracting to tell you the truth.
    It throws off the weight balance as well. I might also consider a little bit heavier
    weight for the attorney line. possibly just the SC version of that face scaled
    up a little would do the trick. If you do the grey for the bottom, it would make
    sense to make it a touch heavier. This will help it from being eaten up by the
    big red above. I&#39;m not saying you want an equal weight distribution between
    the two elements, more of a 70/30 ratio. right nw I think you are at more of an
    80/20. <BR> <BR>Just my thoughts.

    A sans might clear that up, I&#39;m not sure. Something simple, a grotesque face,
    I would suggest. Possibly even a trade gothic? Try that one for size. I feel something
    extended, with a wide footprint.
