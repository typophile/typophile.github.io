  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All,

Work has been keeping me away from typography & design all year, and I finally jumped in to something and realized that it's unfortunately not like riding a bike. Specifically, I found that my eye for kerning is in atrophy. {Okay, so maybe my eye for kerning, composition, and color are all in atrophy.} I haven't really been able to tell where adjustments need to be made — hopefully it will come back to me. I have attached a title slide that I had put together, in hope that someone could point out a few spots where the kerning could use some tweaking. Maybe with some help I can begin to start seeing things the way I used to.

I am also hoping that someone would recommend some light reading about typography. I'm in desperate need of motivation and/or inspiration.

Thanks!
Casey</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'll give it a go, although I'm not 100% confident of my kerning ability either.

Close up the space on both sides of the "o" in Louis; both sides of the first "d" in Mildred; the whole word Adam needs help, but especially closing up the space around the "d"; and tighten the space around the "w," "s," and "o" in Wilson.

As for light reading, I can suggest some things to read, but I'm not sure if much of what I've read about type would be considered light (although I read it for my enjoyment).

I've always been enamored with [[http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189913912&sr=8-1|Bringhurst]], so if you haven't read that, go for it. Even though reading something akin to a style guide/type speciment sounds dry, it's gripping as far as I'm concerned.

I'm in the middle of <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/Counterpunch-sixteenth-century-designing-typefaces/dp/0907259065/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189914002&sr=8-1|Counterpunch]]</em>, which is quite good so far. I wouldn't have thought a book largely about the mechanical side of type would be interesting (I've never been much for this kind of stuff), but in fact, Smeijers explains it so clearly that you feel like a master punchcutter reading it. The beginning part also has some thought-provoking points to make about the Renaissance revival of classical letterforms.

Ah-ha! Two good, lightish type books: <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568986998/ref=wl_it_dp/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&coliid=I24IVWHBG78ZY4&colid=3JXWXBKAYLA0F|79 Essays on Design]]</em> and <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977985040/ref=wl_it_dp/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&coliid=I1US0SSB3WMNUB&colid=3JXWXBKAYLA0F|Made with FontFont]]</em>. Michael Bierut talks about design in general, not just type, but he has some entertaining things to say about both graphic design and typefaces (check especially his essay "I Hate ITC Garamond"). <em>FontFont</em> is useful for introducing oneself to the highlights of the FontFont library. Some of the essays are fascinating (Martin Majoor's I remember), while others are less so and are outdated. A number of the type specimens are brilliant as well (the one for FF Unit contains a hilarious story by Twain, and I the one for FF Nexus, I believe, is absolutely incredible).</div>

Kerning aside, I am not a big fan of letterspacing "ADAM WILSON"... (Just my opinion, of course -- no one asked me.)

But back to the kerning: one thing that jumps out is the lack of space between <strong>T</strong> and <strong>h</strong> in "The Porchies"...</div>

[EDIT] Okay, to add some usefulness to this comment, I will recommend a few books... (And <em>Counterpunch</em>, already mentioned above, is supposed to be quite good. Same goes for the one by Michael Bierut, a thoughtful, articulate designer).

<em>Anatomy of a Typeface</em>, by Alexander Lawson (cited on hundreds of threads here on Typophile, I know!)

<em>Revival of the Fittest</em>, edited by Philip B. Meggs and Roy McKelvey, if you can find it.

		<div class="commentbody">I recently read Robert Bringhurst's collection of talks, _The Tree of Meaning_, which I can recommend.

For kerning, I suggest looking at it upsidedown and squinting looking for light and dark areas, I don’t mind the Th joining but I would look at the spaces adjacent to curved characters and AWV.

All three of the books I mentioned are broken up into chapters or essays, so they are easy to put down and pick up again as the mood or time strikes you (similar to what Tim said about McLean's book). But 400+ pages in one sitting -- yeah, that's a tough one.  ;-D

On the other hand, Lupton's book is easily read in just a few days, and has plenty of substance (not that the others don't, of course).

About <em>Revival of the Fittest</em> -- I think it rapidly went out of print, because it goes for  lots of dollars on Amazon, hence my comment... but you can still find copies in antiquarian book stores. And there is always your friendly public library.</div>

I mentioned it in part because it seems to me that Bringhurst's ideas about caps spacing especially are more Zaph oriented ( the tighter model ) and were also ideas that I was confident you would run into. Whereas Jan's ideas ( wider ) are less common. I don't suggest either one per se - I just think they both have merit and are worth mulling over.

My current idea about it in case you want to know is that the forms of Caps aught to be a factor in your approach. Some cap forms really benefit from wider spacing. I feel like Gil/Johnston style or English style caps fall into that category. With other forms it's reversed. In any event it's about cultivating & trusting your eye. Being able to modify forms can help too if the forms will be big it's and a tricky word like OCTOBER or LAWYERS.</div>
