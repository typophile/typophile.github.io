body: "hello,\r\nI recently installed CS3 on my computer (MAC OS 10.5) and I work
  with Fontlab 5.0.2; I now experience a very strange thing... While Fontlab generates
  my opentype whitout problems (appearently), the CS3 apps don't recognize ligatures
  fi and fl... And it is also impossible to take these glyphs from 'special characters'
  or popchar... \r\nThe same font works fine in CS2 with MAC OS 10.5 or 10.4!  \r\nDoes
  anyone experienced this? It could be my fault or error in generating opentype? \r\nThank
  you very much for your answer!\r\n\r\nRoberto"

    You can use something like FontNuke to do it....\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "... I tried to clear all font caches, even with FontNuke or FontFinangler,
    but the problem is still here... I think it could be a problem in Fontlab encoding,
    or I do something wrong in encoding. Fonts I buyed from Adobe or other foundries
    work fine... the strange thing is that the same fonts I generated work well in
    CS2, and have troubles in CS3... \r\nThank you! \r\nRoberto Necco"

  body: If you are talking about InDesign, in CS2 we didn't utilize the language &
    script tags when applying OpenType features, but in CS3 we did.  I suspect that
    the ligatures may be marked as only running in a particular language or script
    which isn't matching the actual text. In CS2 we used the equivalent of "default"
    language & script which you can get to in CS3 by applying [No Language] to the
    text.

  body: "Roberto, \r\n\r\nit is, indeed, possible, that you have not registered the
    ligatures in all languagesystems that your font is using. \r\n\r\nI also recommend
    updating to FontLab Studio 5.0.4. \r\n\r\nAdam"
