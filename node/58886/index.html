How did the Vietnam Memorial get to &ldquo;own&rdquo; a layout as simple as:

<p>I think that the key factor here is running the advertisement on the subway line that takes people to the memorial. That mall has been running various wall-of-names ads for years, they just tend not to handle the ad placement so badly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mayalin.com/">Maya Lin</a> designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, although I don&rsquo;t know who chose Optima.

</blockquote>
<p>Huh? According to Hermann Zapf where and when? In Linotype&rsquo;s brochure for Optima nova, there is a photo of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial lettering, because it is done in Optima. For the same reason, in at least one of Hermann Zapf&rsquo;s books, a picture of a rubbing from the wall appears as well.</p>
<p>You should know who John Benson is… aside from being a type designer in his own right, he ran the John Stevens Shop in Newport, RI for decades, and undertook a number of prominent lettering commissions in Washington, DC (and elsewhere). His son Nick runs the business now as far as I know. I&rsquo;m sure that David Berlow could fill in more details.</p>
<p>The story that I had been told was that Maya Lin spoke with him about the lettering. It would have been too labor intensive to letter all of those names by hand, so a typeface was used instead. Apparently, Benson suggested Optima to her, and it was used.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Being a VietNam vet and living 4 miles from Tyson&rsquo;s Corner, this is not an issue of who owns all caps Optima lists. This is VERY clearly a take off on the Memorial. Anyone who thinks otherwise has not seen it. I am as fond as anyone of the visual pun but this is just insulting and in very bad taste. I hated the war then, I hate the war now, I hated being there and seeing a country being strangled by bloodshed there while another country, mine, was being strangled by lies and losses of its own. Whatever you think of that time in our history, the people who died there needlessly deserve better than this mockery. 
Imagine if Bloomingdales&rsquo;s or Macy&rsquo;s in New York would place posters in the New York subways depicting people jumping out of windows of the WTC holding signs with the names of the various department store locations? This isn&rsquo;t just a coincidental use of Optima, it is done on purpose. I can&rsquo;t imagine the conversation at the presentation of those ads to the client. Sick bastards!</p>
<p>Like Dan said above, everybody who lives around here knows damn well what that is!</p>

Is it really true that they knew enough about the memorial to ape it&rsquo;s style, but not enough to appreciate it&rsquo;s meaning? Could the work have been outsourced to another country or something? I could almost imagine someone using Google&rsquo;s image search for ideas&hellip; but then not really understanding the image they were using.</p>
<p>It also reminded me of this:

The song wasn&rsquo;t even the US national anthem yet… that happened later, in the 1930s. But the resonance of this song before that baseball game went over so well that it was quickly incorporated as a feature in ALL major league baseball games, not just World Series Games.</p>
