  I the only one who paid for a subscription but didn&#39;t get the goods? Do snake-oil
  salesmen still exist? Or am I being too harsh. Could somebody please tell Don Hosek
  &#40;a founder of the ethics-centric TypeRight...&#41; to let his subsribers know
  exactly when to expect the next issue, or how to get their money back? <BR> <BR>hhp '

    now I&#39;m feeling a bit peeved too. <BR> <BR>He should either prioritize putting
