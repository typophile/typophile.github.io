  is a very common one, but for some reason I am having some trouble putting my finger
  on it -- I imagine you all can figure it out in 2 secs, so I thought I'd post --
  thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ab5e15a72b6ca47d742520507a73ed44_6014.jpg]"

  body: My bad, I (as usual...) over-read your request. Can't identify the slab BTW.
    If this comes from a online website, try to inspect CSS code, it might reveal
    font name.

  body: "A quick visit to the website revealed the font name: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/adelle/\">Adelle</a>.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there is something strange going on. For some reason I cannot find a variant with
    the alternate one-storied /g -- its default /g is double-storied. The superior
    and inferior /g, on the other hand, <em>is</em> one-storied. It strikes me as
    odd if the designer purposely selected an inferior /g and scaled & moved it into
    position ... But perhaps he did. Or perhaps there is a version of Adelle with
    this alternate as a selectable option."

  body: "Sorry: on further reflection, this is <em>not</em> Adelle. It's not just
    the /g, the /t also doesn't match. (As well as a number of ever-so-slightly differences.)\r\n\r\nI
    guess their webmeister searched for a webfont similar to their identity font and
    came up with this. Good job -- but now I don't have any suggestions left."
