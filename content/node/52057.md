  really fit with the rest of the typeface (which I'm sure a few will agree, isn't
  the nicest), but I thought the g was pretty cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/efg_6439.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone
  got any other gems they would like to share with us? Or their favourite character(s)
  in general?"
