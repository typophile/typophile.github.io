body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am trying to understand better OT features in commercial
  fonts since the features I write are pretty basic.\r\n\r\nWhen I check the following
  piece of code:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nfeature dlig
  { # Discretionary Ligatures\r\n # Latin\r\nlookup dlig14 {\r\n    sub A E by AE;\r\n
  \   sub I J by IJ;\r\n    sub O E by OE;\r\n    sub a e by ae;\r\n    sub i j by
  ij;\r\n    sub o e by oe;\r\n} dlig14;\r\n\r\nlookup dlig15 {\r\n    sub period
  period period by ellipsis;\r\n} dlig15;\r\n language AFK ; # Afrikaans\r\n language
  DEU ; # German\r\n language NLD ; # Dutch\r\n language ROM ; # Romanian\r\n language
  TRK ; # Turkish\r\n} dlig;\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n...
  If I understand well the substitutions asked by the lookup \"dlig15\" and \"dlig14\"
  \ will work only for the languages listed by the statements. Is that right?\r\n\r\nAnother
  question:\r\nOnce the font is installed, what does the OT file in order to identify
  the language in use? Does it check the selected keyboard?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRamiro.\r\n "

  body: "In Adobe InDesign you can set the language of each paragraph of text through
    selecting it and setting\r\nit's 'language'. Okay- I remember having to change
    this after modifying InDesign files for a catalog we were sent from Germany, so
    that I could spell check it.\r\nIn Illustrator- Show Options in the Character
    panel, then choose your language from the list at the bottom. (To change the language
    for just the selected type). \r\n\r\nNow, I've had to do this for spellchecking
    reasons (most of the ad stuff I do has to be bilingual) but I'm not positive that
    OT features are picking up on this setting... Just checking the keyboard wouldn't
    work too well for anybody who works in more than one language."

  body: "Starting with CS3 InDesign does look at the language selection in determining
    whether to apply OT features or not. Through version CS2, however, all it did
    was choose a dictionary for spell checking and hyphenation.\r\n\r\nHaving said
    that, there is a bug in CS3. I believe it was with the various forms of German
    not calling features correctly. Adobe documented that, and it was fixed in CS4.\r\nChristian
