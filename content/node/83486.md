  here with experience from the digital/e-book publication world?\r\n\r\nBW,\r\nKristian"

    the new .issue format. Wired Magazine and several other publications use it to
    create their iPad magazines.\r\n\r\nhttp://layersmagazine.com/using-indesign-to-publish-your-ipad-magazine.html\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to try it, you can download a free trial version of InDesign 5.5 at Adobe's
    site. It's fully functional but will only work for 30 days unless you buy it.\r\n"

    somewhat limited, but I''ve produced books with custom fonts including OT features
    like small caps, different numeral sets etc. It requires a little extra effort
    though.'

    \r\n\r\nYour app/method of choice dependes on a lot of things: How big is your
    budget? How are you going to make money on this? Are you going to make money on
    this? Is the current paginated app style the best model (read some of iA's musings
    on that one -- swiping vs. scrolling)? Do you have a budget for font licenses
    (embeddable tends to be expensive)? What level of user interaction do you need?
    Do you want people to be able to read your magazine offline? Have you considered
    other platforms?\r\n\r\nI went through a process like this a while back and found
    the best solution for my clients needs was a website custom tailored to the iPad's
    resolution, orientation modes and \"touchability\"."
