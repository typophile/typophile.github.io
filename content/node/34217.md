body: "I'm back, but I am desperate. :-)\r\nI have Perla alternate (lower case) as
  my logotype - first question, would it look too confusing and \"messy\" to pick
  another font for the word \"Collections\" and for the names of the collections,
  or should I go with Perla all the way? The problem is that it's very hard to read
  it when it's a smaller size and it has to be smaller than the first page on the
  web site. And secondly, would it be even more confusing to choose two different
  fonts for the two collections and keep the rest of the text in something neutral
  like \"Century gothic\" or something more \"clean\"? I've been thinking about this
  -after someone suggested it to me - and it is a good alternative to the fact that
  I didn't managed to get symbols for the two collections. \r\n\r\nIf I should just
  go for Perla all the way except for the rest of the text, can anyone suggest a font
  that would match? Thank you!!   :-)"

  body: "Perla is expressive enough that you might in fact need another font between
    it and the text sizes, at least onscreen. I'd try a low-contrast Didone, like
    maybe this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/walbaum-text/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It's customary to keep a logotype reserved for \"special\" purposes only.
    So you could certainly go with another face for headings and subheads. There are
    many that would work with Perla. \r\n\r\nStorm's Walbaum is a great choice, or
    Emigre's Filosofia (I hear the spacing is improved). Both look nice on screen.
    Or a geometric sans like Proxima Nova, Gotham, Avenir, Futura for a different
    effect. That's your call."

  body: "I'm thinking Filosofia is probably a better choice than Storm's Walbaum-Text.\r\nFor
    one thing it's narrower, which is almost always a plus onscreen. Plus it's a\r\nlot
    more elegant, without going for high contrast.\r\n\r\nBTW what's your HTML body
    face [first] choice, Georgia?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I wouldn't use a font like Filosofia which is close in spirit to Perla. I'd
    go with a sans that has a similar shape. Seb's example is a good one.

    to finding it when I was looking for a font for my logo.  What's the name of the
    font in the picture? Yes, it does make a nice match with Perla. Like all the other
    suggestions - they're clean and simple. I don't think one should pick a font that
    could or should \"compete\" with Perla.  :-)   \r\n \r\n"

  body: "hrant - I never intended to be part of this forum again. But\r\nthen I ran
    into the problems with my font which to me was\r\na disaster. I'm racing against
    the clock to get this web site\r\nlaunched because selling jewelry is my sole
    income now and I\r\nhad no one else to ask for help. But when you and others asked\r\nme
    to post an image of the logo, a person who works with me \r\non this (with marketing)
    advised me against it. He thought I\r\nrisked having someone else \"steal\" the
    name. I have - as you\r\nknow - previously posted the names of the collections\r\nand
    several pictures of my jewelry (probably not that smart\r\neither) and was actually
    cautioned by someone at Typophile\r\nto get the rights before another company
    stole my ideas. So I\r\ntold the truth and that was the main reason not to do
    it.\r\nBut having said that, I'm sure you're right too. Part of me\r\ndoesn't
    want to reveal anything more about me because of\r\nwhat happened, which is really
    sad, because that's not who\r\nI am and that's not how I felt when I first became
    a\r\nmember. But I'm not trying to hide - if I'd wanted to do that\r\nI could
    just have created a new account.\r\n\r\n "
