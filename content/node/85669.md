  if i copy and paste all of them in my windows/ fonts folder. I would like to know
  if there is a software that allows us to browse all fonts in that folder and helps
  me choose the right one so i can copy that font alone and install it.\r\n\r\nI would
  be grateful for any help.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"
