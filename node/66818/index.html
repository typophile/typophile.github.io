		<div class="commentbody">The type and frequency of accent collisions depends heavily on the language used. Native American languages have some orthographic practices that cause thorny problems in this area, like the use of multiple accented vowels in sequence, surprising letter combinations, or unusual sequences of diacritics. Consider examples like íì, íë, fì, ęj, fš, and fā which are not sequences that occur typically in European languages. How much of this should a font designer reasonably be expected to prepare for in advance? It is however not that much trouble to automatically generate a large pile of text with potentially problematic combinations and then eyeball for the worst ones.</div>

Think of type as an artifact of Guttenberg's promotion of the printing press rather than the photocopier. On that model, it is better to design ligatures to solve crashing problems that would be avoided by the skilled scribe.

* * *

I don't know how much the font designer is responsible, esp. for Native American language combinations. To add to the list above, Kiowa uses macrons above and below vowels. The combination i+macronbelow, f, i+macron does occur. Of course, the editor wants the word in italic. "Crash" isn't strong enough to describe such a mess. I know this the usual way; I had to set it. The solution was to draw several f-ligatures to work with the various vowels. I'd say the designer can't anticipate all such occurrences; what they can do is to have a EULA that permits the compositor to go into the font and do the needed work.</div>

Better yet, use contextual variants to dynamically create ligated or otherwise adjusted glyph sequences that resolve collision problems. This is more flexible than creating actual ligature glyphs, and enables you to hit a wider range of potentially problematic sequences with a smaller number of glyphs.</div>

That is what I did in the case above. As you say, a slightly fewer numbers of glyphs to create. For the Kiowa, I used several variant f's rather than ligatures. As I remember, there one "f" for use with an i+macronbelow before, one for an i+macron after, one for any other vowel with macron or grave after, one for the i+macronbelow with a vowel+macron or grave after, and a final one for the specific sequence mentioned above.

Whether to use liga or calt depends on what is involved, and the solution. There are a number of European languages where an f followed by certain accented vowel are problems. Depending on the font, sometimes I make up a ligature, sometimes switch to a different f via a calt feature. Sometimes I use both, a ligature for the i and only a different f for other vowels. 

YMMV, but my point is that much of this is only possible by the compositor, who has a manuscript in from of him/her. To anticipate all problems just isn't possible -- I believe even Ross Mills wonderful new font doesn't cover Kiowa.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I put together a 6MB text file containing newspapers and Wikipedia articles from European languages and a few others I had listed above. I also Googled each pair just to see what came up. I assumed FPKTVWYft are the only letters at risk for accent collision. Lowercase t is an unlikely risk but I've made some strange lowercase tees before. In small cap fonts you might want to check more A accent pairs.

I don't think any capital accents are collision risks.

</ul>

The whole point of this is to have a "at the very least, check these pairs" list. What to do about accent collisions is a different matter. I just want to have a reasonable, practical list that covers the majority of European languages which use Latin 1,2,3,4. If anyone knows of any important pairs I've missed, please let me know.</div>

There's no reason to slavishly perpetuate such bad design.
If the result is 1% less historically Scotch Modern but 100% better ahistorically (read: functionally) then it's almost certainly good design.

		<div class="commentbody">An early 21st century solution to the ogonek clash might be to use wider tracking throughout the text. I haven’t a clue how the early 20th century printers managed it, but most of what I’ve seen in Athabaskan texts is actually pretty good.

I agree that the Scotch Modern a-ogonek is a disaster. I’ve seen examples where the ogonek was hung in the middle, which is antithetical to Eastern European typography, but can be acceptable for Athabaskan uses given careful design. Of course there are other occasions where they used a cedilla instead...

Any font aiming to support the majority of European languages should also try to handle the Pinyin occurrences. The demand for such support will only be increasing with time, and seeing the good support for various European diacritics would lead most users to expect the Pinyin ones to work reasonably well too.</div>

Note that Hànyǔ Pinyin with proper tone marks appears almost exclusively in pedagogical contexts (in particular, Chinese language learning and Sinology). Even in China proper Pinyin orthography has no everyday use (bar education). However, this fact does not nullify your thesis; demand for such support will surely increase, and any conscientious type designer would brook no collisions involving Pinyin diacritics.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Omitting tones from romanized Chinese is not very different from leaving the accents off caps in French: a custom arising from the character-set limitations of typewriters (in the case of French) and 1-bit fonts.  A great deal of sinological work still doesn't bother with tones, but it is reasonable to hope that usage will increase as the number of fonts with Unicode <em>pīnyīn</em> continues to grow (in 2008 <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html">Thomas Phinney</a> reported they are included in Adobe Latin 4).  Sinology may be coming around: for example, in 2008 the University of Chicago press included tones in Sigrid Schmalzer's <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&bookkey=5780990#">The People's Peking Man</a> -- where there is a noticeable difference in type color between pages with lots of <em>pīnyīn</em> versus those without.

Yes and no.  If one feels the need it is not so hard to simplify typing by telling MS Word to auto-correct "Ha4nyu3 pi1nyi1n" to "Hànyǔ pīnyīn".  And if one isn't sure of a particular character's tone MS Word's Phonetic Guide can produce its <em>pīnyīn</em> on the fly.  The various u-dieresis with tones are a particular pain, of course, but where there's a will ...

I can't be convinced that marking tones for romanized Chinese will ever spread beyond scholarly and technical publications, even with expanded font and input support. Will you see people spelling their own names with tones? Will road signs in China include tones for road names and place names? I just don't see this happening.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the important point is not whether the use of Pinyin  will become extensive and common or not. (I agree with you that its distribution is likely to be limited, though perhaps surprisingly large.) Learners can be expected to be somewhat familiar with Pinyin, and will occasionally encounter a situation where they may feel its use is important. In those situations, font designers are obligated to at least think about the results of Pinyin diacritic combinations, whether they bother to support them or not.

Font designers do not generally make fonts for use in random, one-off situations, at least not when designing fonts for commercial use. A good font is instead designed to be functional and convenient for the largest variety of possibilities within the designer’s capabilities and the design’s restrictions. This is a hard idea to characterize precisely of course, but it is intuitively easy to grasp: make your work fit as many possible circumstances and uses as is within your means to support.

My point is that if a font designer bothers to include the various European diacritics in a font, then they should consider the uses that an imaginative user might subject the font to. Deciding whether to support these uses is of course a separate decision, but a reasonable designer should at the very least ponder the possibilities. The large and increasing number of Mandarin Chinese learners – and occasionally native speakers – who have some interest in Pinyin behooves font designers to at least consider the possibilities inherent. Of course it’s still up to the individual designer whether they bother to invest the effort or not.</div>

As one can see from this – admittedly humble – proof, the result is roughly the same, both in terms of quantity and of selection. That means, rather few pairings are in particular danger. These are the i_accents following f or P or T or V; a_ e_ and u_ogoneks followed by j. The worst candidates seem to be the combinations f_igrave, T_imacron and Ukrainian idieresis_idieresis.

		<div class="commentbody">The sequence fj also occurs in English, where the word <i>fjord</i> is borrowed from Norwegian. It’s common in some contexts, like nature writing and glaciology. Although <i>fiord</i> is preferred in much of the Commonwealth, <i>fjord</i> is usual in the US and to a lesser extent in Canada.</div>
