  know i've seen it before used in more classy circumstances, like on the covers of
  paperbacks from the seventies...\r\n\r\nI also think this font is used for the Netflix
  commercial, for the \"Wrightnow Family\" title at the end of the skit...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0000040372_20070607144010_5659.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks, Brett - \r\n\r\nAfter a brief search online, I've come to the conclusion
    that this font does not exist anywhere in a freeware form - can you confirm that?\r\n\r\nI'd
    like to purchase it, but my company has no budget for anything like this right
    now (or so I am told) - do you know where/if I can get this font for free from
    somewhere?"
