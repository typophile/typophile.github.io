    a new trend. Looks like a customized <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=baskerville&sample_text=JPMorgan&sample_size=48\">Baskerville</a>.\r\n"

    of some kind, although some of the serifs are reminiscent of a Bodoni.  That might
    reflect one of the older JP Morgan wordmarks that was based on Bodoni.\r\n\r\nGood
    to see them try to differentiate themselves from the Chase retail banking side."
