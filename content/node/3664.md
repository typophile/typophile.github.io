  a spread for a magazine for class, but can&#39;t figure out what the copy should
  be set in&#93; ... the closest i have come is Caxton, ITC Jamille, or ITC Weidemann
  ... but it&#39;s none of the above.. :&#92; any help would be appreciated! <BR>
  <BR>&#91;ps: i&#39;ll probably have problems uploading this image.. bear with me&#93;

  body: ' Eidetic Neo is actually the only Emigre face that&#39;s also sold elsewhere
    &#40;the designer&#39;s own site&#41;. Maybe the pre-existence of an earlier incarnation
    of the font created that unique outcome - but Eidetic Neo is really a unique face
    itself. Anyway, I have a suspicion that Emigre gets a cut of any copies of it
    sold through Psy/Ops &#40;which is perfectly fine&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '
