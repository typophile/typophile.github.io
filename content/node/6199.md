  target="_blank">http://www.2001exhibit.org/arts/designs.html</a> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  an exhibit of the graphic design &#40;logos, signs, console displays, &amp;c&#41;
  on the movie 2001. <BR> <BR>The designers didn&#39;t &#40;unfortunately&#41; do
  any custom type designs.  They seem to have made the assumption that the future
  will belong to Futura,  Classical Sans, Eurostile, and stencilled Helvetica.  One
  spaceship sign was odd, using Helvetica with Future M&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Paul'
