    on a Mac. \r\n\r\nSometimes, when I open a file before the fonts are open some
    of the characters switch to other characters. I've found that I have to restart
    Illustrator to remedy it."

  body: "I've learnt through the years that if Illustrator has a problem it's usually
    related to fonts. Try quitting Illustrator, trash the preferences, turn the font
    off, turn it back on, relaunch Illustrator and see if that fixes it. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    if your swatch pallets ever go missing in Illustrator it's (probably) because
    there are a) too many fonts open b) there is a corrupt font open. You could try
    turning off a couple of fonts you don't need active while you're at it before
    you relaunch Illustrator and see if it helps. "
