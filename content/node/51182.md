    because I love the title of this thread.\r\nOf course letters are a metaphors
    of the very thing they try to communicate i.e. the a communicating a-ness.\r\nBut
    then when we know its an 'a', then what kind of 'a' is it?\r\nIs it a kind a or
    an aggressive a, what did it have for breakfast?\r\nIt becomes very Type CSI.\r\nInteresting.\r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\nMichael
