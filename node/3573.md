    a, compare to the black has a too wide top and why using the serif. Did you think
    to use that serif for the black one?  '

  body: "Look out! Crit coming through! \r\n\r\nThe heavy weight isn't working as
    well as the base weight for me. The contasts are lively but they overwhelm rather
    than pleasing my eye in the heavy weight. That B is a problem. In general I think
    you need to add some distictiveness to the letterforms so they don't resemble
    each other quite so much. Then the face will become funky. The distictiveness
    I am loooking for is in your a & your x. The n & v are mssing it.\r\n\r\nKeep
    going with this. It could get quite good."

  body: "Luciano,\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like you've got more fonts worked out in this
    family than you're revealing to us at this time. For example: the large title
    'sinaptix 0.1 [regular]' title looks like a 24pt typeface [21px], with 6px wide
    stems and 3px wide arms.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, your 'sinaptix 0.1 [black]' title looks
    like a 24pt typeface [21px], with a main dimension of six pixels for its horizontal
    elements, and a dimension of 9 pixels for its vertical elements.\r\n\r\nWhy not
    show us these fonts too, at their 8pt size, instead of their effective 24pt size?
    \r\n\r\nFurther, right now, you are showing us your 'regular' and your 'black
    at 8pt. Why not show us your 'thin' and your 'bold'? I strongly suspect you have
    them!\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring all this up, is that I see you've used different
    strategies for your glyph corners, and would like to see more use of the techniques
    you used in your 24pt titles applied to your 8pt text samples.\r\n\r\nEven if
    doing so meant you had to widen the entire family of fonts, I think it might be
    worth it.\r\n\r\nAs for the current 'Black' sample text, I'd like to see you create
    another version where your horizontal elements do not gain a pixel in dimension.
    Keep all horizontal elements at one pixel high, and instead of widening your characters
    to maintain their 'interior' dimensions, as they do now, try maintaining their
    'exterior' dimensions when widening your stems.\r\n\r\nOverall, I like your Sinaptix
    a lot in a lot. Again, I think the face would be stronger if you implemented the
    three-pixel corner technique as shown in your title texts, into your 8pt text
    designs. "
