body: 'This is the identity for Pressure Washers Inc. a company that specializes in
  pressure washing for the trucking industry. <BR>What makes PW stand out from competition
  &#40;besides the nice new logo&#41; is that they have better containment of debris
  and chemicals &#40;a special wet n&#39; dry vacuum system&#41;-which translates
  to environmentally conscious.  <BR>Clients of PW are mostly men, truckers and corporate
  clients that own fthe fleets. In this field there is no clear leader. My client
  and I are trying to establish his company PW as that leader of that industry. The
  usual identities related to this industry are amateur jobs.I am guesing other cmpanies
  in the field do not consider truckers critical in choosing companies to clean their
  vehicles. I agree they are properly less picky that someone shopping for a $3000
  watch. We still think a slick identity will help getting new clients.  <BR>BTW this
  job came with a 48hr. deadline as the Yellow pages ad <BR>needed to be ready in
  2 days. I think it is pretty good considering the time frame. I cam upload older
  version if anyone is interested. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-post.pl?action=posting_upload_form&what=show&img=26718"

  body: here is a few more newer versions. Client thought last version looked like
    it was for a shampoo brand. I can see that so where do I take it from here with
    no time left. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26724.jpg"

  body: Ole, the swoosh doesn&#39;t say pressure to me, it says ocean wave. I like
    the type but make the INC as small as possible. Try Italic with some force graphic
    making it italic. For your deadline use just the type and then explore the mark
    for future uses with the graphic.

  body: The swoosh doesn&#39;t really bother me. Does it say pressure? No, but the
    word pressure is present, so I think the water representation is enough. If anything,
    I agree with your client, in that it reminds me of hair for a cosmetic/shampoo
    logo

  body: I like the swoosh the only thing that&#39;s bothering me is the E it seems
    large and out of place.

    an unprecise feeling. <BR> <BR>Just some thoughts...'

  body: 'Hi Ole,  <BR> <BR>here are 3 ideas:  <BR> <BR>- Use the same direction of
    the curve with the A cross bar and the ilustration wave. <BR> <BR>- Use the wave
    but add pressure to it. You can use a presion point in the wave, fro example in
    the middle of the wave, so that way youve got a different icon instead of the
    wave. <BR> <BR>-Use Blue with some calid color combination, to show a pressure
    energy on this..you can use violet or some red color near to the blue. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>I think the Ying and Yang does not fit at all. <BR> <BR>BTW, please gimme
    your opinion of my Ma'

  body: The Fleet Services work has already gone through 2 print cycles <BR>&#40;4
    color process &#43; silver foil logo&#41;. Client was very happy with results.
    The critique got started again because there was comments on the Pressure Washers
    work that was posted 13 months ago. I should have mentioned that the Fleet work
    was <BR>already printed/delivered/used. I agree with Tanya there was a few tweeks
    needed on the curves.
