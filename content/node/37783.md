  that the only references I come across lead me to a particular font.  That is okay,
  but what I want to know is why and typically where they are used and some examples
  of their use. \r\n\r\nIs ESPN an example of a stencil font?"

    out of military life - and marking crates for soldiers to know what each crate
    contained.\r\n\r\nMaybe I watched too much M*A*S*H\r\n\r\nLet us know what you
    find out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile - and example of Stencil Fonts are fonts where the
    characters are broken up - so they can be \"duplicated\" onto walls, boxes, etc.
    You can go to http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=stencil and see commerical
    stencil fonts or http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=114&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Type+your+text+here&nb_ppp=50&af=on&psize=m&classt=pop
    to see shareware/charityware/beerware...\r\nbut also take a peek in at House Industires
    they have at least one very interesting and nice stencil font...(whose name escapes
    me right now) and several \"fun\" type stencil fonts.\r\n\r\nP.S. If you mean
    the logo here: http://espn.go.com/ -- I personally, don't consider that a stencil
    font - it's more of a \"techy\" font..."

    are the predecessors to stencil fonts, if you are interested in going that far
    back. I'm aware of 2 papers, the first in Typography Papers 5 and the second in
    Typography Papers 7; as well as at least one in Eye and another in Baseline. His
    line of work, I am sure, has good bibliography information. You can reach him

    jobs in mills and factories. Stencils were used to mark material for easy retrieval
    in a warehouse. They were an efficient way to mark numerous crates over and over
    on all sides so that they can be read from any vantage point. Since \r\n\r\nPittsburgh
    was above all an industrial town, It makes sense that the Steelers would follow

    made to improve hand painting of letters where such expertise was lacking, (Pittsburgh
    perhaps and the Military most certainly being good examples). After the islands
    were painted, the \"so simple a private can do it\" bridges were s'posed to be
    painted as well to make it look like there was an expert involved.  Oh well ;)
