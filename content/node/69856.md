body: the attached image shows the cover type on the current edition of "der spiegel",
  a german magazine. it's an article about apple so it should be myriad, but it isn't.
  any ideas? i really like these letters ... [img:sites/default/files/old-images/iKult_5109.jpg]

    be Myriad if this was an Apple ad. Independent journalism should use what they
    want.)"

    I think the italic is book weight.

  body: Thank you microspective, that's it! The letters on the cover look quite straight
    but when you see the whole typeface, there are some quite unconventional forms,
    especially the small "a" and "g". I would not have expected the rest of the alphabet
    to look like that ...

  body: Sure thing. I use Vista in my company logo (and the avatar to the left is
    a custom form of Vista's <em>m</em>). Don't sound so disappointed about the other
    forms! The OpenType fonts have a handful of alternates. It's a pretty versatile
    face. Enjoy!
