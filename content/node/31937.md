  repeating elements. Pixel- or stitch-based fonts are a good example of this, but
  I'm looking for fonts made from other patterns/units besides pixels and stitches.
  If anyone has a name for this type of font that would be helpful too. In case this
  all sounds too vague, one example I've found is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontboy/roartype-one/\">RoarType
  One.</a> Thanks for your help!"
