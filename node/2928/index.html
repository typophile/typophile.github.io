There is no such thing as a right to a continuing ROI. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eric Gill is long gone. Let's support contemporary type culture, as an expression of the present day and age, by licensing contemporary fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not saying there isn't a place for the classics, but they should not dominate the scene the way they do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interesting that you mention Gill Sans, as this was one of the typefaces that Adobe gave away on an Illustrator CD in the mid 90s. Millions (I assume) of free copies. Well, that's one way to prime a market. But it kind of pulled the rug out from underneath Cronos. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gill Sans is a 1930s typeface. The bowl of the a has the bulbous look of the baby carriages of that era. To me, it looks totally incongruous today. However, it made a valuable contribution to the living tradition of type design: if art directors want to choose a typeface that, because of its structure and proportions, works in a similar manner, they should use the present day &quot;equivalents&quot;, such as Cronos, Scala/Seria Sans, Bliss (good choice, m-ga), Agenda, Eureka Sans, etc. That would make our business more vital and sophisticated than if everyone just uses poor old Gill.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe were GIVIG AWAY Illustrator!? When was that? I thought Illustrator always cost money, and obviously, the customer also paid (among others) for the fonts included. They were not free copies, but of course, they were greatly reduced vs. the fonts sold separately.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't agree that Gill Sans is &quot;poor old&quot;. I'd rather say it's &quot;great old&quot;. I myself prefer a good typeface over a new typeface. Among the designs you listed, I can't find a single one that would be superior to Gill Sans. To me, the first sanserif for years that can stand up against Gill Sans is Frantisek Storm's Sebastian:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's similarly sophisticated without being artificially elaborate.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I were to choose between Gill and Cronos, I'd choose Gill &ndash; even if both were designed at the same time. The same for Agenda vs. Gill etc. I won't even compare Scala Sans, Bliss or Eureka Sans. They're nice but have by no means the touch of eternity and universality that Gill Sans has. I'd say, Gill Sans is still better.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

But if that person has to choose another typeface for another project next week, and again after that, and if choosing a typeface becomes part of that person's job description, e.g. if he is a graphic designer or art director, I think there is something wrong with choosing those reliable and proven typefaces year after year, for every purpose.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But &quot;mood&quot; is the only justification for making new type.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is probably true for display type, but in my experience most new text type development is driven by economic and technical requirements and what might be termed 'appropriateness to purpose'. We need new types because we keep producing new texts, and new kinds of text. This has always been the case, and it is worthwhile to map major developments in the history of type design to developments in literature. 'Mood' may be one of the factors that makes a typeface appropriate to a text, but it is certainly not the only one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, there is also the question of whether one needs to justify the making of new type &ndash; or a new chair design, or a new piece of architecture &ndash; other than by variety and by the human need to create new forms.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">After doing some research (only some because there is much more to be done) I'll agree that in general EULAs can be very restrictive.
