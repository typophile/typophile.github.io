  to be flexible and work on whatever comes my way! I've got to redesign an industry
  magazine - and it's not an area I work in everyday.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the brilliant
  resource in Newspaper design at <a href=\"http://www.newsdesigner.com\">newsdesigner.com</a>,
  I was wondering if there's any kind of equivalent for magazine design?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSimon"

    to go and beg borrow or steal a copy of the book SURPRISE ME by Horst Moser.

    Borders. Just grab a ton of relevant magazines and examine their guts to see how
    they solve the design process.

  body: "I don't know of a similar site for magazine designers, but the printed annual
    of the Society of Publication Designers is a rich source of inspiration. There
    are a few examples of winning work on the society's site:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spd.org\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592531814/sr=8-1/qid=1141972330/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9319734-7656151?%5Fencoding=UTF8\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'll second Gary's recommendation of \"Surprise Me\" and David's \"haunt the newsstand\"
    approach. I use both tactics from time to time. ;) "
