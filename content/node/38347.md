  body: "wwwwwwooooow !!!\r\nAm really curious to know which are those 7 languages
    you can design fonts for??_\r\n\r\nI am also from India, and have a little knowledge
    of 3 Indic languages other than Hindi  but since I born, brought up and studied
    in a Hindi environment, I can only challenge myself to design good Hindi fonts.
    Other languages are as foreign as France for me. For me, having a bit knowledge
    isn't enough for a solid output. And even if i design, i will have no idea whether
    its good or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really want to see your work samples if you want
    to share."
