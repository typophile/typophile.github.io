  5 year old thread and it called for a show of business cards. It has a link to another
  thread, but the link is broken.\r\n\r\nI'm sending my cards to the printer's on
  Tuesday, and I post the photos once I get them. But I also thought it might be worth
  repeating the 2003 thread.\r\n\r\nAnyone's interested ? \r\n\r\nI'm sure quite a
  few of you have cards that are just waiting to be bragged about :)"
