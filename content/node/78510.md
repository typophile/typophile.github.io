  top dot of the colon is appearing and printing small when loaded into an app.\r\n\r\nThe
  dot on my i looks okay though. The top dot on my ; looks swell.\r\n\r\nWhat the
  holy hell?\r\n\r\nI have deleted and replaced these dots and yet they still continue
  to shrink. God help the font designer who also receives this wretched curse.\r\n"

    (clockwise or anti-clockwise) got reversed in the shrinking dots. There is a command
    that does that somewhere on FL.  BTW can fonts be installed in the ipod touch?
    Just curious.\r\n"

    You''ll have to make sure your iPod is jailbroken and that you have Cydia installed
    on it first to use it. '

    of their contours ran in the correct directions. And that worked. Either that
    or something else I did worked but I think it was that.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
