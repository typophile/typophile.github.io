  the new history of the typeface. I also read that Apple licence the Linotype version
  of Times, and in addition they licence Times New Roman from Microsoft who in turn
  licence it from Monotype.\r\n\r\nMy question is this: I want to obtain the very
  best Times. I have an Apple. Is the Times on my Mac the same as the Linotype Times
  \ offered for sale by Linotype? In other words, is the system font 'Times' the same
  and as high quality as the 'Times offered by the major typeface foundries?\r\n\r\nI
  know there are other alternatives. I have Lido, Nimbus Roman, and plan to buy Starling.
  \r\n\r\nBut if anyone can point me in the direction of the most beautiful 'Times'
  [and I realise this is an oxymoron for some, as I've read the forum on the pros
  and cons of Times] then I'd appreciate it.\r\n\r\nWith apologies for loving 'Times'
  ;-)\r\n\r\nThank you."

    easily be distinguished from it by looking at the shape of the lowercase italic
    z; the Monotype version has two straight crossbars, the Linotype one has the lower
    bar curved.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Linotype version in metal type seemed to me to
    be just as good in quality as the Monotype version.\r\n\r\nEven the authentic
    versions from the major foundries, though, don't seem to look exactly like the
    metal type versions. One reason is that they follow the common practice of being
    based on very large sizes of the typeface - which was optically scaled.\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface Times Ten might be worth your consideration."

  body: "Thank you for your reply.\r\n\r\nMy concern with the Monotype Times is it's
    licensing by Microsoft. My understanding is that the Times New Roman bundled with
    Windows is effectively the Monotype Times, or are there differences between the
    purchased version and the bundled version. Thus, if I purchase Monotype TImes
    New Roman would it look just like a standard Microsoft Word document?\r\n\r\nTimes
    Ten is under consideration."

    licensed it to Apple. Windows 7 includes a newer version, some bug fixes and additional
    obscure characters. So the one you have is probably fine.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative
    how about Font Bureau Starling? "

    a pdf-file, that shows a comparision of Times NR MT Pro, Times New Roman PS Pro,
    Times LT Std, Times Ten LT Std and Starling.

  body: "Here's what Allan Haley of Monotype told me about Times New Roman:\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    spacing and design of the OpenType version of Times New Roman set at 12 point
    (and the alphabet length) is virtually identical to 12 point Times New Roman set
    in metal. There are, of course, differences in individual character-pair spacing
    in some instances, due to improvements made to the general spacing in OpenType
    fonts and the addition of kerning pairs not possible in hot metal. Overall, though,
    the spacing is virtually the same. The two versions clearly color out the same.
    \u2026 If you use the PostScript Windows version of Times New Roman, however,
    the alphabet length is markedly shorter than the standard Times New Roman \u2013
    and character designs had to be modified to accommodate the new spacing requirements.
    This is because the design was forced on to the widths of Times Roman from Linotype
    (the version that Adobe chose to use). \u201CTimes New Roman PS\u201D matches
    the Linotype character widths and spacing, while just \u201CTimes New Roman\u201D
    is true to the original design.</cite>\r\n\r\nIn addition to Starling, also look
    at Tiempos Text and Plantin."
