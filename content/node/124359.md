  but those \"r r\" aren't from the same family, anybody can help me tell which font
  is that? or at least something that is VERY VERY close to it?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_4_3742.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_4148.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4243.jpg]"

    beef it up and edit the loop):\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/radio-trust.font?text=rr\r\n\r\nAny
    chance of sharing the entire logo? It may give us clues to help you identify this
    letter...."
