body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm rather new here and have to say that I an so thrilled to
  have found this community.  It's fabulous to have someone to talk to about type.
  \ Most of my friends eyes glaze over if I even say the word :-b.\r\n\r\nI'm working
  on a logo for a client that supplies the jewelers trade.  I fell hard for Priori
  Acute and have them in love with it now as well.  I am now in the process of determining
  the font pairings and thought someone might have an opinion. \r\n\r\nI'll be setting
  a tagline as well as their name spelled out in full. Can't use Priori Acute for
  the full name as it will often appear small, for invoices and the like, and the
  sculptural beauty and playullness of it disappears at smaller point sizes.  \r\n\r\nThe
  Eras Medium in the tagline is merely a style placeholder. I want something that
  \ supports the type above, but does not compete with it.  something perhaps a bit
  approachable... any thoughts?\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/8_sfjs_logo_dev_3704.jpg]"

    F and the British Pound symbol.

  body: "Yeah, although I like Eras it's too 70s here.\r\n\r\nI was going to suggest
    Perpetua, but then I read \"approachable\"... Is the font you choose for the tagline
    going to be used for a good amount of text too?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you can read his comments about the ideas behind the design here: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.webstandardistas.com/2010/01/priori-acute.php\r\n\r\nStephen
    - I tried it and didn't care for them together.  Too period.  I'd like a lighter,
    complimentary effect.\r\n\r\nHrant - I thought to stay away from serifs, though
    that was what I tried initially, because though I tried several it seemed a bit
    over the top.  The Logotype is such a strong persoality, that I am thinking perhaps
    to compliment it with a sans.... I'm looking at Advert Light http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_advert_light/

    The letters present exactly as designed.  I did size, kern and rotate the finished
    logo.  I also crafted the lower case f out of a cap F and the British Pound sign.  '

  body: "I would suggest something sharp, like <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/beaufort.html\">Beaufort
    Extended</a>.\r\n\r\nBTW, equalizing the weight of the inline would improve the
    ambiguity of the effect, by putting all the letters on the same plane, as it were.
    At the moment, it looks like the J is too close to the viewer, and the S's too
    far back."

    and the S's too far back.\r\n\r\nBut I think that actually adds an interesting
    -and fitting- dimension of depth to it! It's like you're looking at a triangle
    from the top (with the \"J\" the high corner and the others sitting lower).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Thanks Hrant! That part of the design was done on purpose.  Though I did
    not change the perspective, the J is larger in proportion to the f, and significantly
    larger than the s''.  I wanted to emphasize the "Jewelers" in the name and pull
    it forward a bit.  The font itself very obligingly supplied the effect.  Did I
    say I love this font :-)) ?  '
