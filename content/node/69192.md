  fonts that come in both sans and serif variations, either a suite or two individual
  faces that work well together, for a title treatment design. I'm currently using
  Bodega Sans and Serif in my comp, which is a perfect fit proportionately, but not
  a great fit stylistically (reads a little too retro).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are
  appreciated."

    narrow as you want, but a solid sans/serif pairing."
