  am making a cash register application and I need to find the closest match for this
  font. Closest I was to this font was MS Gothic or perhaps this one: http://www.whatfontis.com/Hypermarket-Cond-Light-green-type.font?text=JOBCODE:%20Restaurant\r\nbut
  its noot good enough.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a possibility it isnt even a real font
  and its the printer internal font, or whatever you call it?\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate
  any help, \r\nThank You in advance"

  body: I believe you are correct in your assumption that it's not a "real font,"
    but a proprietary font for this particular dot matrix printer.

    are fonts coming with the driver, but none of them matches the receipt.\r\n\r\n"
