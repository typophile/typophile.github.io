  font and I have some problems with the lower \u201Cr\u201D and the other lower glyphs
  connected to it.\r\n\r\nAm I supposed to do a ligature for every lower letter connected
  to the lower \u201Cr\u201D? That sounds weird.\r\nWhen I look at my script fonts
  installed on my computer there are no big amount of ligatures.\r\n\r\nThere must
  be some other solution to it. \r\nWhen I look at fonts on MyFonts, like Ciao Bella,
  there are no ligatures for the lower r but when I write it in the \u201CSample text\u201D
  field there is a more accurate connection between the lower \u201Co\u201D and the
  lower \u201Cr\u201D and the \u201Ce\u201D and the \u201Cr\u201D and so on.\r\n\r\nAny
  smart and simple solution to this?\r\nPlease help me.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nAndreas

  body: "Right, you definitely don't want to make a font with ligatures for every
    combination of characters. Not only would the font be huge, there are usually
    more than two characters in a row that may need the same special treatment. \r\n\r\nThe
    trick is to write a contextual alternates (<code>\"calt\"</code>) feature. There's
    more than one way to do it, so you need to plan it out first and then implement
    it in feature code. One way to do it goes something like this:\r\n\r\nThe default
    \\r will be designed to accept the usual connecting stroke coming from the glyph
    that precedes it. In the absence of such a glyph, you need to substitute an alternate
    \\r that doesn't connect. The code would look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    calt {\r\nignore sub @glyphsthatconnectontheright r' ;\r\nsub r' by r.alt ;\r\n}
    calt ;</code>\r\n\r\nwhere \\r.alt is the non-connecting version of the \\r. The
    <code>ignore</code> line basically says, \"if the \\r follows a glyph that connects,
    skip the next part\". If it's some other glyph, then it will substitute the alternate
    \\r. (The apostrophe marks the glyph that you want to potentially substitute.)\r\n\r\nThat's
    the basic idea. There are other approaches. You could for instance make the default
    \\r one that <i>doesn't</i> connect and substitute a connecting alternate when
    it follows glyphs that connect. Or, your connection scheme may be more complex
    to get a more natural appearance (more than one possible connecting stroke, for
    instance, low, medium, high, none)."
