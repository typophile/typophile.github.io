  2007 program</a> and I have a question.\r\n\r\nIf you were a student attending,
  which parts would you want to visit? I know it's good and beneficial, yada yada,
  but realistically? \r\n\r\nWhich parts should I under no circumstances miss? For
  instance, listening to Matthew Carter or Robert Bringhurst would/should benefit
  and interest even the most newbie of Typophilers, and I won't be missing any of
  their parts. \r\n\r\nAny others that I should be looking forward to as a student?\r\n"

    it. Do you want to be a better designer or learn more about making type? Or some
    other thing.\r\n\r\nAlso when you say 'parts' - you mean classes- yes? \r\n\r\nThere
    is also a whole big Typecon seperate from that. If you don't teach you may not
    need to go to the educators forums... "

    make me a better person and a designer over the long run. That's why I like listening
    to Bringhurst, he really makes you want to do things the right way*, not the lazy
    or ignorant way.\r\n\r\n*There is no \"right way\" I know, but there is a \"right-er\"
    way."

  body: My plan is to do the font design sessions, the letterpress sessions, and then
    just follow Jonathan Hoefler around and try to absorb and greatness that pops
    out of his head.

    type designers and graphic designers will be around though--and very accessible.
    \r\n\r\nSee you there!"

    DC, we should do local SoTA meetings now and then. They would have to be more
    productive than the local AIGA meetings are."

    way I'll get in is as a volunteer. \r\n\r\nDoes SoTA have local meetings? There
    are enough here in Seattle that meetings could totally be a possibility. A meeting
    for graphic designers actually interested in their typographic work rather than
    appearances would be very interesting."

    a waiting list for the full classes. Believe it or not, sometimes there are last-minute
    cancellations that allow for waiting listers to get in.\r\n"
