  elements. Probably ones with only one or two colours and little or no pictures.
  Good typography is a must. \r\n\r\n\r\nsome sites i've found:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.coudal.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typographi.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/fourdayweek\r\n\r\nhttp://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/oct/01/what-does-it-mean-be-professional-web-designer/\r\n\r\noh
  and i think typophile makes the list :)"

  body: "Shaun Inman's recently lauhced <a href=\"http://www.shauninman.com/post/\">a
    pretty interesting redesign</a> that's pretty type-reliant -- even the coloured
    bar on the left of the page is partially constructed from type (bullet points
    for the corners and caps, it seems).\r\n\r\nHis use of colour to indicate the
    passing of time and the relative age of posts is pretty interesting as well."
