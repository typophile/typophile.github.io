body: "Swiss Style takes design back to simplicity, the notable principles of this
  style are based upon geometry, grid systems and pure objectivity. The design of
  this time moves away from hand drawn illustration and relies heavily on the use
  of industrial photography. The style is recognizable by use of sans serif, flush
  left, ragged right type set in narrow columns, giving it a look of precision and
  uniformity. My favorite designer of the period is  Josef Muller-Brockmann. In this
  particular image his use of scale and camera angle are visually interesting and
  delineate movement. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mullerbrockmann_3512.jpg]\r\n\r\nVictorian
  Era design has very ornate design, symmetrical layouts  and overall is very romantic
  and nostalgic. The image has thin decorative borders enhancing the text. I like
  that it is hand illustrated and very realistic. I love the typography of this time,
  it has a lot of ornamentation and is drawn to curve around the images and various
  hand drawn typefaces are incorporated into one poster. The posters designed during
  this time covered he entire page leaving little, if any  negative space.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beecham_4994.jpg]\r\n\r\nPop
  Art is a period of art that combines art with commercial and a reflection of that
  particular time. Everyday we are bombarded with advertisements and slogans and its
  not often that I stop and think of how much power they have and how absurd they
  sometimes are. One of my favorite pop artists is James Rosenquist, who was a billboard
  painter and who now makes billboard scale paintings. The painting below, F-111,
  was made during the Vietnam war and is made up of 23 sections, 10 x 86'. It depicts
  the war, economy and daily stream of images an American would see or a part of what
  someone could be experiencing during 1964. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f111_opt_3650.jpg]"
