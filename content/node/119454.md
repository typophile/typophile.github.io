  remember the time I was posting messages about the evolution of the Simplease logo.
  It started more than 5 years ago and it had produced a fair amount of artefacts,
  which can be found inside the linked messages below:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/58042\"

  the last years we were relatively happy with our logo:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://fs.simplease.at/XjHuBRahCo.gif\"
  alt=\"Old Simplease logo\"/>\r\n\r\nNevertheless I was never really satisfied with
  how it had turned out and tried dozens of redesigns and spent hundreds of hours,
  working on concepts and ideas that all turned out to be mediocre at best.\r\n\r\nSome
  days ago there was this idea of trying to set the word in a unicase type in the
  hope of ending up with a nicer and simpler overall appearance. I tried some different
  fonts and stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeotones/designal/\"
  title=\"Designal at myfonts.com\">Designal</a> from F\xE9lix Ruf\xEDn.\r\n\r\nI
  reworked the \"L\" to represent a lowercase \"l\" based on the underlying theme
  of DIN and worked on the overall rhythm by choosing a somewhat looser tracking.
  Finally I worked on the kerning and ended up with this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://fs.simplease.at/H2EJ4CptXv.gif\"
  alt=\"New Simplease logo\"/>\r\n\r\nIt would be really great to get your feedback
  on the concept, choice of font, and especially the tracking and/or kerning.\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much :)"

    not much choice between a big white gap or sitting uncomfortably on the baseline...
