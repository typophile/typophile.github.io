body: "I have found the perfect letter 'B' for a tribute tattoo. It is the elegant
  Schneidler by Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler, who is sometimes referred to as
  F. H. Schneidler. \r\n\r\nI can find little biographical informational about him
  in English. He seems to have been born and died in Germany, during the mid-century.
  Does anyone happen to know about his ties to the Third Reich. I just want to make
  sure that I don't commemorate my Jewish grandfather with an state-sponsored designer.
  Thank you for your assistance."

    really trust the biographer, can you? What if it was a propaganda plan to fill
    the world with nazist B's so they wrote a fake biography just to fool people like
    you and me in the future? I hope you are young enough to learn how to make tattoos
    since you can never be sure the tattoo person is not a nazist. Good luck and send
    us a pic (not taken by Leica of course)

    agree. Thus, the importance of knowing the designer's biography, to better understand
    her ideas and how they fit within a time and a place. So when you critique the
    value of a movie do you not consider the time in which it was created and how
    the director fit in to that time period? Seriously, please explain."

  body: Of course you better understand her work by knowing the historical context.
    But I think you can't say "oh she did that work for Hitler so she is a bad artist."
    Many great people that lived in Germany at that period are now depreciated by
    questions like "what if she/he was a nazi". I don't try to be the smart one here
    but I think neither Leni Riefenstahl knew what was going on neither the Jews in
    Germany. That's why so many did not leave the country. I think that American Government
    is just a more elegant butcher. You can ask native americans, black people, the
    japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki about that. I am not saying the people of Afghanistan
    and Iraq since your government has not finished the holy job there yet.

  body: "<em>Which I believe translates approximately that he was a professor at the
    national arts and crafts school at Stuttgart throughout the war.</em>\r\n\r\n\"Staatlich\"
    is this sense means that the school was publicly-funded, but almost all German
    institutions of higher learning were/are funded by the state. In this case, the
    state is not the \"State\" (i.e., the national government in Berlin), but the
    \"state\" (i.e., the local province of W\xFCrttemberg, now part of a larger post-war
    German state, Baden\u2013W\xFCrttemberg).\r\n\r\nSo the school got, and still
    gets, its funding from the state government, which was/is seated in Stuttgart.
    It wasn't a National school, just a state-funded one. Even the Bauhaus, when it
    was located in Weimar, had the word \"staatlich\" in its name (staatliches Bauhaus
    zu Weimar).\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about Schneidler. I can't say what his
    politics were. And to try to make judgments based on three-line biographies is
    impossible and not really something to recommend. But, since he was employed by
    the state government from 1921\u20131948, it is probably safe to assume that,
    when the Nazis came into power in 1933, they did not have a problem with him.
    That doesn't mean that he was a Nazi, it just means that he wasn't Jewish/Handicapped/Openly-Gay/Gypsi/A
    Communist/A Trade-Union Supporter/anything else the Nazis didn't approve of. Maybe
    he was completely apolitical, or maybe he just kept his opinions to himself. Or
    maybe he loved Hitler and all that, but just kept teaching instead of joining
    the party or the SS. We can't know from just a few lines in a biography. He clearly
    did not become too involved in the Nazi way of being, because he wasn't fired
    after the war, but was able to keep working until retirement in 1948, it seems.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and just to stir up the pot: I think that Riefenstahl knew. Just because she denied
    knowing anything after the war doesn't mean that she should be believed at face
    value. She made a lot of pro-government propaganda. Whether she believed everything
    in it is less important than this glaring act. She tried to get other Germans
    to go along with it all."

  body: "1. Your concern for the memory of your grandfather is touching. If you want
    to do more, learn more about Judaism. \r\n\r\nTatooing is against Jewish tradition
    as it is explicitly prohibited in the Torah (Leviticus 19:18). It seems that the
    origin of the prohibition is that it was part of pagan practices--pagans would
    tatoo the names or symbols of the gods they worshipped on their bodies. Also there
    is a rabbinic prohibition against harming the body--unless for an important benefit,
    as in surgery--as one's body is created by God.\r\n\r\n2. 'Kon', your comment
    about Leni Riefenstahl really stinks. She knew of Hitler's violently anti-Jewish
    views and admired him anyway. Also she  certainly later knew of the public support
    of attacks on Jews, and the laws dispossessing them of their homes and livelihoods.
    According to the Wikipedia article on her, she late in life--in 2002--falsely
    said that Gypsies in one of her movies all survived the war. She was sued by a
    Gypsy for holocaust denial--a crime in Germany now, I believe--and only was let
    off the hook by the judge because of withdrawing her claim and her extreme age.
    \ \r\n\r\nYour equation of the US and Hitler is also outrageously unfair, but
    I won't go there. "
