  body: Asia is a big place - not sure what &#39;Asian&#39; means in Boston. Are you
    looking for something Japanese, Korean, Chinese, or maybe something more Indian?
    More details on the nature of the project would be helpful.   <BR> <BR>Si

  body: thanks all, for all the fabulous ideas, especially on a vague subject matter!  &#40;I
    work for a company where people can have very vague requests, so ALL your input
    was helpful&#41;.  It was for a simple invitation, I found a typeface that was
    free &#40;very key&#41; and reminiscent of Chinese characters.  Wasn&#39;t really
    what I wanted, but on a time constraint, money constraint, and the client was
    happy. Thanks again!!!!
