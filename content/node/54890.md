  this add. Old school pen and paper, pure art and beauty. It is a very successful
  advertisement, in my opinion."

  body: I would guess this is Photoshoped onto the notepad, but still a beautiful
    image. The shear creative play between image and lettering is outstanding.

  body: 'It''s odd how rare seeing something done by the human hand has become. 20
    years ago no one would have blinked over someone using such archaic instruments
    as pen and paper to produce an illustration.  Unfortunately, once the object of
    the ad has been properly "trained" he or she will probably never pick up a pen,
    preferring a way to produce this entirely digitally. '

  body: "This is a lush add. Think that it is amazing how we don\u2019t believe what
    we see anymore. As nice as it is looks a part of me just doubts that it is a real
    pen and paper job. I would have to see the pad with my own eyes to believe it,
    I suppose that\u2019s the Photoshop curse though.\r\n\r\nI hope that the illustration
    was created by the pen in the pic, it would be nice for an advert not to lie for
    once, and give me hope that there are still free handers out there being recognized
    for what they do.\r\n\r\nStef\r\n"

  body: Looks freehand, maybe photoshoped a bit tho. Its probably safe to assume that
    the guy/gal who did the art for this ad has a decent job and is doing what they
    love. Go artists and designers!

  body: Its a nice ad, but i can safely say its photoshopped onto the notepad. You
    can tell because a ballpoint pen is not transparent enough to allow the lines
    of the paper to show through. It was probably placed on with a multiply blend
    mode - nice drawing none the less. very clever.

  body: "Lovely ad. Great idea and great execution. I would hazard a guess that it
    was first drawn roughly in pencil to bring all the elements together and ensure
    a nice composition.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is I hate drawings in blue Biro -
    in fact, I wish blue Biro had never been invented (every time I look for a pen
    it always seems to be blue!) My fickle complaints aside, it has definitely been
    drawn by hand and I love it!"

  body: This ad would not hold the visual weight it does if the blue ballpoint pen
    was not a ubiquitous instrument for note jotting. Therefore, props to everything
    we think is cliche or overdone. Just another weapon in my design arsenal.

  body: "What feast for the eyes...simply delectable... \r\nI agree it was well thought
    out, carefully drawn and likely digitized, to overlay the tablet. I applaud the
    final product, however it arrived.\r\n\r\nThe physical aptitude to draw well is
    so compelling, that I found ways to make ink washes on paper, which can be very
    unforgiving, behave in a true gestural style...on demand...\r\nby completing several
    ink washes of the same subject, then using a collage technique to marry the best
    areas into one perfect (to me) ink drawing...like layers. "

  body: "This is great. It takes the everyday, the hum drum, and the mindless and
    transforms it into an art form. I make lists everyday, to do lists, grocery lists,
    anything that is running through my head constantly until I get onto a piece of
    paper. The list above represents the trivial things we use and need in our daily
    lives that we might forget to appreciate. What would you do if you didn't have
    access to bread and milk, and toilet paper!?  \r\nJess"

  body: "I agree Jessica. I can't tell you how happy I was when I came across this
    on the internet. Unfortunately, I am too busy to make my everyday lists look this
    amazing because of school, but I have let it inspire me in other ways. For example,
    I have been much more creative when it comes to writing titles on my philosophy
    notes, and when a teacher uses a funny word or something really important is said,
    I take the time to make that word or phrase into something special in the margin
    of my notebook.\r\n\r\n-Jessica"

  body: In my opinion, one of the best parts about this work is that it appears as
    though the designer started with an image and forced the text into it. What I
    mean is that this piece looks very thought out so that the pictures become text
    rather than text become image, if that makes any sense.

  body: "Hey guys... all these comments are super encouraging!!\r\nBut just wanted
    to clarify the source of the piece. My name is Amritraj Gupta and i am an art
    director at TBWA (Dubai). I illustrated this piece last year as part one of three
    visuals for a recruitment company (Career Junction: part of Arab Media Group)
    \ The piece was illustrated on the same pad of paper and the only photoshopped
    bit on the image is the header that says 'GROCERY LIST'\r\n\r\nJacqueline.. i
    think Alison Carmichael's work is quite nice but unfortunately is not really the
    owner of the piece.\r\n\r\nThis was a older post on my blog dating back to the
    time when the piece was made - http://www.artraj.com/blog/2008/04/\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all the comments guys. it was tons of fun to work on the project.\r\n\r\n-Raj\r\nwww.artraj.com/blog"
