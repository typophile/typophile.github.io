body: I&#39;m an independent filmmaker and my current short is a black &amp; white
  homage to &#39;60s French new wave films. I&#39;m trying to simulate the look of
  subtitles from the pre-DVD, pre-closed-captioned era. Any suggestions? Thanks.

    have any visual examples that you could show us?

    would work. Subtitles were pretty primitive back then I believe.  <BR> <BR>Or
    are you looking for more of a nouvelle vague style for the type '

  body: 'I became interested in the concept of type design for subtitles a few months
    ago.  In my phase of cramming as much information on the subject as possible,
    I discovered that there is one handsdown expert on the subject--Joe Clark.  Go
    to his site:  <a href="http://www.joeclark.org" target="_blank">www.joeclark.org</a>
    <BR> <BR>When you get there you can either browse the seemingly endless resources
    he provides, or you can email him with your question and I&#39;ll bet he can answer
    it.'
