body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've looked through the FL manual but can't find anything mentioning
  a autotrace feature, but I was sure that FL had one, am I wrong\r\n\r\nI bought
  a copy of FL's Scan font but I've never been able to get it work. I click the ScanFont
  icon then click the install button and then accept the license agreement, but then
  I always get an error window saying - \"Installation interrupted - can't create
  destination folders' tree\". I tried contacting FL about this matter but never got
  a proper response. I'm using a Mac OSX 10.3.9.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help with
  the Scan font problem then I wouldn't need a autotrace in FL and that would be great.\r\n\r\nRr."

  body: In Fontlab, paste the bitmap that you want to trace into the glyph, it will
    become that glyphs background. Then use Tools > Background > Trace Pixels or Tools
    > Background > Trace. You can even add the Background menu to your toolbar and
    make this a quick button click.

  body: Start reading at page 456 of the Fontlab manual. Be aware that everything
    refers to simple bitmap format images because Fontlab will not process other kinds
    of images.

  body: "I'm using FontLab 5.0.4 on XP. I got it to work by pasting an image from
    Photoshop directly into FontLab Studio. It showed up as a gray background image.
    Then I used Tools > Background > Trace. The results were less than spectacular.\r\n\r\nUnder
    Tools > Options > Trace Options I made some adjustments and got much better results
    as far as following the contour. Unfortunately, there were way too many points,
    and the cleanup was too time consuming.\r\n\r\nI didn't spend much time on it,
    so there is probably a way to tweak it to get even better results, but drawing
    it manually seems like the best way to ensure a quality result."

  body: "You may find BitFonter 3 (which is a sort of ScanFont on steroids) giving
    the best results when it comes to autotracing. I agree that the tracing in FontLab
    Studio may be suboptimal. One trick is to convert your image to black-and-white
    and try different pixel sizes. In FontLab Studio, more does not always mean better.
    The autotracing of an image that is 800 pixels high may give you better results
    than of one that is 3000 pixels high. \r\n\r\nAdam"
