    the answer.\r\n\r\n<em>How does one say \u201Cnot again!\u201D in German?</em>\r\n\r\n(muffled
    sound of frenetic screaming) \"My baby! My baby!! They killed my baby! Ahhhhh
    my baby!\"  ;^)\r\n\r\nI don't mind Helevetica. I don't love it either, but I
    tolerate it, because it's there. Typographers like my compatriot Stephen Banham
    who make a point of loathing it desperately need to find some design work of their
    own to do.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
