    a match. Serifs are more prominent in that font, for example."

  body: "Arrow was a Visual Graphics Corp (VGC) typeface in the Film type era, and
    it was in the pre-acquisition versions of the Image Club Letterpress CD (one weight
    only). The typeface also shows up as a single weight in the Phil's Photo \"Homage
    to the Alphabet\" book from 1985. Joe Treacy's Arrow family was originally a Headliners
    family from 1992, before he took over that line of fonts. One book I have says
    Arrow was a type design by Walter Diethelm, a Swiss designer who died in 1986.
    There was no picture of it, so I'm not sure it's the same typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    to Diethelm in 1966-67. (edit: I fixed the spelling of Luc's last name).\r\n\r\n-
