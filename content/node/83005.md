body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am designing the user guide for a web application,
  in html and pdf version. As typeface I have chosen FF DIN Web because I was looking
  for something technical but still cool, and that could work in both formats.\r\n\r\nI
  will design the website for this software too, and I would like to carry DIN to
  tie the two experiences. For the website I am looking for a definetely less technical,
  more friendly human and warm tone, so I will use DIN only for navigation labels,
  meta and other secondary text.\r\n\r\nWhich typeface do you think I could pair DIN
  with for body text and heading? As I said above, this typeface should have a human,
  reassuring, warm tone contrasting the modernity and cleanliness of DIN. And obviously
  available for font embedding.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention."

    bit cold to me. Maybe I am wrong?
