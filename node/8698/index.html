  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So i was wondering if anyone had some interesting images of well known typefaces in progress and under the knife? i think it would be great to be able to see Helvetica or Univers being drawn or redrawn by hand. Maybe not even something that well known, just something being actually made by hand. I've seen some sort of images of Renner's Futura being constructed mostly since it's based on hard geometry and visual proof of that is exciting to see as well as revealing, so i really think seeing other typefaces in such circumstances would be wonderfully eye-opening and informative. any insight would be much appreciated!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Significant collections are available to those who can travel and can persuade the curators that they have a reason better than curiosity; keep in mind that most museums have an obligation to preserve, and it doesn't get much flimsier than working sketches and inked sheets. Some designers have had retrospectives issued in their name, or major exhibitions that, thankfully, were accompanied by substantial catalogues &ndash; these are pretty easy to locate. However, a major work has been announced for publication in a couple of months that has not appeared on any pre-publication reviews yet, so I will shamelessly take the opportunity to plug <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Printer's Type in the Twentieth Century<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.
