  super-families that offers maximum scripts or language support? I am not considering
  typefaces like Arial Unicode, they seems to me are different typefaces (at least
  their Indic fonts) compiled together. I was curious to know about the families that
  offer true companions such as Fedra Sans (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari
  etc).\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    is a Venetian Roman face designed to serve scientific publishing, in the fields
    of humanities and linguistics in particular.\r\nBy now Andron Mega Regular contains
    about 5500 glyphs, it comprises these writing systems:\r\n\u2013 Latin\r\n\u2013
    Cyrillic\r\n\u2013 Greek\r\n\u2013 Coptic\r\n\u2013 Gothic\r\n\u2013 Runic\r\n\u2013
    Ogham\r\n\u2013 Old Italic\r\n\r\nExhaustive Unicode support is given for Latin,
    Greek and Cyrillic. Additionally, Andron Mega provides complete Unicode support
    for Phonetics and Hundreds of ligatures, fractions, numerals, abbreviations, currency
    signs, symbols and many other typographical fancies.\r\nCandidates for an upcoming
    extension of Andron are most likely Hebrew, Armenian and Georgian; perhaps Arabic.\r\n\r\nMore
    Roman fonts of the kind are to be find at the [[http://www.mufi.info/fonts/|MUFI
    site]].\r\n\r\nOne of them has been upgraded recently: [[http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/~jmag0042/alphabet.html|Alphabetum]]
    boasts with about 6300 glyphs and many writing systems."

  body: "I second Andron Mega. It is a wonderful font, with visual elements that compose
    a strong identity through all scripts supported.\r\n\r\nAnother source is Rosetta
    foundry. Their fonts are also high quality products with multiple script support
    \u2013although not so wide as Andron.\r\n\r\nAlphabetum and the SIL fonts (Doulos,
    Gentium, Charis) also covers many scripts, but you don't get the same level of
    visual identity. Another source is Unifont.org: the fonts available also covers
    many scripts (but again, without high quality design).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Arial Unicode MS, as Satya said, is basically different typefaces thrown
    together. Andron Mega, Fedra, and the typefaces I mentioned are multi-script families
    where the different components were designed to go together.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    just looking for fonts that support multiple writing systems, a professional Japanese
    font may reasonably include hiragana, katakana, kanji, Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic,
    but the latter three will usually be existing designs chosen to match the specifically
    Japanese scripts. I know Korean fonts that cover all those writing systems and
    of course the Korean alphabet, but the same point applies. It is rare to see sizeable
    multi-script families where each component is designed from scratch to harmonize
    with one another, not just taken from an existing catalogue. I believe this is
    why Satya is asking this.\r\n\r\nLots of popular designs like Gill Sans, Meta,
    Palatino, and Farnham that were not necessarily created to be multi-script families
    are later adapted to different scripts like Greek, Thai, and Arabic due to client
    demand."

  body: Oops, I didn't read the original post properly. I think the reality of it
    is that generally speaking the most common demand is for a latin and a particular
    non-latin script to go together. Then there are countries where one other script
    is also common. But more than three in harmony, particularly with very different
    historical roots? Is there any need for that?

    there any examples of typefaces in which the Latin characters are designed after
    the Arabic, Cyrillic, Armenian glyphs? I would guess with most commonly used typefaces
    (at least in Europe and North America), the Latin is created and the rest is stylized
    to look similar. I'd be curious to see the results."

  body: "<cite>Is there any need for that?</cite>\r\n\r\nIgor Freiberger has made
    some good points already for that. Additionally comes to mind:\r\n\r\n\u2013 the
    six main languages of the UN are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and
    Spanish. There you have 4 writing systems at once.\r\n\r\n\u2013 In Israel Hebrew,
    Arabic and Latin are in everyday use, not to forget Russian \u2013 3 or 4 writing
    systems at once.\r\n\r\n\u2013 The major scripts of India count about a dozen
    or more.\r\n\r\n\u2013 In classical studies there is very often to deal with Hebrew,
    Greek and Latin on one page, even in the same sentence. Depending on the subject
    and period dealt with one is likely to additionally encounter Arabic, Phoenician,
    Syriac, Etruscan, Old Egyptian (3 systems only for that!), Linear A or B, Coptic,
    Ethiopic, Gothic, Glagolitic, Armenian, Georgian, Runic, \u2026 You can establish
    that situation for any region other than the Euro-Mediterranean: America, Asia,
    Africa.\r\n\r\n\u2013 The literal history of Azerbaidzhan comprises Arabic, Cyrillic
    and Latin. I\u2019m curious how a written history of the land\u2019s literal heritage
    may look like.\r\n\r\n\u2013 In user instructions for any technical device you
    often find the explanations in 20 or more languages, which means: Latin, Cyrillic,
    Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, \u2026\r\n\r\nThese are only
    few examples which come to mind instantly. In the age of \u201Dglobalization\u201D
    the multiskriptive situation will rather increase than decline. Beyond the target
    of 3 or 4 scripts to be adjusted."

    but you don't get the same level of visual identity</em>\r\n\r\nActually, these
    fonts (esp. Gentium) have been designed with a great deal of visual unity between
    the scripts (Latin/Cyrillic + Greek in Gentium).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of different
    aspects to visual unity - harmonized sizing (which <em>doesn't</em> mean the same
    dimensions), perceived weight, consistent level of contrast, curve and terminal
    styling, etc. So while it's easy to unity Latin & Cyrillic, it's more difficult
    to add a Hebrew or Arabic to the mix, but it can be done very well.\r\n\r\n<em>It\u2019s
    a monstrous perspective but: ONE decent font containing EVERYTHING in a harmonized
    fashion \u2013 this is the target.</em>\r\n\r\nI used to think that, but in the
    last decade I've completely changed my mind. Browsers and devices these days are
    quite capable of using fonts specified for specific character ranges. Super Mega
    Pan Script fonts that try to serve many different scripts equally well are difficult
    to maintain, take huge resources, and are always a compromise. For example, you
    can't really do a good job in setting hinting control values or alignment zones
    when you have a dozen scripts.\r\n\r\nIt would be much better to instead have
    an interrelated 'clan' of fonts where any one family only tries to serve scripts
    that are really visually related. Then multiple families could be used together
    (international documents, brand packaging...) with both fidelity to the script
    conventions and harmony to the 'clan'.\r\n  \r\n"

    a great work. Probably my opinion was incorrectly based on the natural differences
    between the scripts.
