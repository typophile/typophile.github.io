  used on a restored classic Ferrari.\r\nHopefully the good people of the forum can
  help me with a few pointers as to the fonts used.\r\n\r\nI'm counting  7 different
  fonts being used - not including the old style Ferrari logo typography (a vector
  of which is also proving difficult at the moment)\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "_SHELL SUPER MOTOR OIL_ Good find Kevin! Much closer than Tablet, where _O_
    was too square etc. For a perfect match very minor tinkering with the bowls on
    _P_ and _R_ to make them less squared and have the leg of _R_ join the bowl closer
    to the vertical stroke,\r\nDon"
