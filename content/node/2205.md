body: Hi,  <BR>Is the word GIFT hand drawn as well? It looks like helvetica, but the
  &#34;g&#34; is not the same. Any suggestions on the font would be helpful. <BR>Thanks,

  body: I guess &#39;IFT&#39; is VAG Rounded, and &#39;S&#39; and &#39;G&#39; are
    handdrawn. <BR>Where did you get this sample, BTW?
