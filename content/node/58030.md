  image has been scaled down sample to fit this page.</em>\r\n\r\nAdobe and The New
  York Times recently announced the <a href=\"http://timesreader.nytimes.com/timesreader/\">Times
  Reader</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/air/\">Adobe AIR</a> desktop
  application is well designed and stays true to the New York Times brand, largely
  owing to the reinforcing quality of the Time's custom typeface. \r\n\r\nThis is
  web content. It's web content that is neatly poured into a desktop application.
  Why is this news? It shouldn't be, except that somewhere back in pre-history when
  the browser was being forged in the fires of mount Doom it made sense to render
  content with fonts installed on the client device, not native to the server where
  the files were hosted. (Sure, it also makes practical sense where 14.4 modems are
  concerned, even if it seems like an evil plot to control the races of middle earth.)\r\n\r\nThat
  was then. But why are we still stuck with a lack of web type options? We hear about
  technologies but aren't sure about implementing them. Font makers licensing agreements
  are only part of this equation but it's time for them to recognize their culpability
  -- even if it's not solely their problem. It's also time for digital designers to
  embrace font embedding technologies and show that they're willing to buy licenses
  for embedding quality fonts. Every major brand understands the connection between
  type and brand identity. It's time to embrace technologies that will let fonts have
  a rich and pervasive digital presence. It's time to sell type to designers and brands,
  and not to every single reader, viewer, and consumer.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine if
  ESPN had to display sports tickers in the fonts natively installed on your television?
  Absurd. But that's what may happen when you start seeing Facebook and YouTube television
  widgets. (It's true, you can buy these TVs today from Panasonic or Samsung.) One
  of the promises of Adobe's <a href=\"http://www.openscreenproject.org/\">Open Screen
  Project</a> allows designers and brands to embed type into applications and widgets
  across devices: desktop, mobile, and TV. The foundries who already allow Flash embedding
  (which is increasingly permitted by many foundries) will win here.\r\n\r\nTypography
  is a means for brands like the New York Times to hold onto an identity that is tied
  to a rich history in printed media, a media that is becoming harder for them to
  justify. And yet, as they move increasingly to digital channels they have to find
  ways beyond the browser to reinforce their brand identity. Isn't this obvious? It
  was back in 1996 when I started my career making web pages and cutting up hundreds,
  thousands of little GIFs. But somehow under the numbing weight of Sauron's browser
  we all grew apathetic. \"Fonts are for print guys\" or \"I need a font when I design
  a logo.\" If you are lucky you get a client who will let you use [[sIFR]] because
  the days of all-Flash sites are dwindling. We saw the power of designing for machine-readability
  which good search engine optimization demands and gave up on GIFs (and at some point
  our souls). \r\n\r\nThe broader context and opportunity for designers, is creating
  digital experiences beyond the browser. Thinking beyond the browser extends to the
  desktop PC to handheld mobile devices, televisions, in-car experiences, etc. One
  of the gaps here is type.\r\n\r\nThe AIR app side-steps the browser discussion,
  but it underpins a much bigger discussion that is yet to happen on a broad scale
  in the design community. Designing for internet content that lives outside the browser
  will become a major discussion among web and branding firms in 2010. It's already
  a major discussion happening among consumer device UI companies like [[Punchcut]]
  and in foundries focused on device type like [[Ascender]] and [[Monotype]]. Questions
  about brand identity and user experience consistency naturally surface when content
  and functionality get poured onto TVs, desktops and handheld devices. \r\n\r\nI
  have to finish with a more personal note. Many of my friends and digital acquaintances
  are type designers. Many of them are graphic designers who pursue this passion on
  the side. Fewer of them make a real living solely from font sales and I have sympathy
  for their business when I write this. It's simply the basic economics of demand.
  A web that is friendly to font embedding, and designers that embrace font embedding,
  will create demand for embedded type that will help type designers flourish.\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n<em>For

  body: "\"Every major brand understands this.\"\r\n\r\nTo play devil's advocate (for
    the sake of discussion):\r\n\r\nIn the 10+ years of web publishing we've had thus
    far, rarely has the lack of custom font selection been seen as the major hindrance
    to the success or lack thereof of a particular web site by those of us that build
    them or use them. \r\n\r\nI think we web designers would be happy for an easy
    solution, but we'll keep on building web sites even if one doesn't materialize.
    At this point, it's a nice bonus rather than any sort of necessity.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, that doesn't change the intent of your message...to encourage more progressive
    font licensing to accommodate the web...which I agree with.  \r\n\r\nAs for the
    NYTimes reader, it's definitely neat and looks great. However, PDF embedding,
    Flash Paper, now Air...rarely have the 'it's like print on your screen' concept
    Adobe has always pushed really ever stuck enough to make any dent in HTML. However,
    potentially the advent of new devices (iPhone, Kindle) will finally provide a
    surface for it to stick to more permanently. \r\n"

  body: "Picking a \"web-safe\" font is the modern analogue of the decades ago typewriter
    and early desktop printing dilemma: \"You can have any font you want, as long
    as it's Courier.\" Now there are are a dozen choices, which isn't all that much
    better since it basically reduces to Times New Roman or Arial.\r\n\r\nThere's
    no technological reason why viewing a website in a browser shouldn't be like viewing
    a printed page or PDF, custom fonts included. The embedding a font in an image
    workaround should be a thing of the past."

  body: "As a type designer who does make a living at this I agree with Joe in many
    ways. The primary thing I am interested in is being paid for the work I  do and
    the fonts I license. Creating custom fonts for branding that allows web embedding
    seems like a no brainer to me. Custom font solutions have always been sold on
    two levels, both equal. 1. Unique type for the brand 2. Unfettered licensing restrictions.\r\n\r\nI
    have no trouble with fonts being embedded I only ask for a modicum of protection.
    99% of the consumers of web sites have no idea how web sites are delivered, even
    a @fontface font would be safe with these users. There are those nasty few who
    do go to great lengths to pirate, but  wonder how much their impact really is.\r\n\r\nI
    talked to my attorney about allowing some sort of web embedding (coming soon in
    our new EULA and website) and his response was to strongly suggest that I formally
    copyright the font software with the USPTO. Doing so allows one to sue for both
    damages and costs, and makes it a little easier to go after blatant commercial
    infringement"

  body: Joe's post also makes me think the the current font licensing model of a price
    for a particular number of computers will also have to be rethought. Perhaps with
    the desire for web embedding, font licensing will take on more aspects of an enterprise
    model.

  body: One of the key elements of why I find the new version of the Times Reader
    so good is how well the type reads on screen. To read up on the technology behind
    that you can read Miguel Sousa's (Adobe) post over at Typblography, <a href="http://tr.im/ljcD">Times

  body: "The Times Reader does have very nice on-screen type.\r\n\r\nAs an application,
    though, I'm still kind of scratching my head a bit. OK, it reads like the paper
    version. But it's more cumbersome than paper and a lot slower and smaller. \r\n\r\nI'm
    not yet sold on print-newspaper column layouts making a whole lot of sense on
    my laptop screen. \r\n\r\nI like it, it's neat, I hope it sticks around, but I
    don't think the Times Reader will be replacing HTML anymore than PDFs or Flash
    did.\r\n\r\nWhich, I suppose, is more of an argument for everyone to figure out
    how to best tackle @font-face. "

  body: "Lately I\u2019ve been wondering if the solution is for somebody to start
    a new MyFonts style foundry just to allow the handful of font designers who want
    to allow font linking to stand out. Having such a resource might encourage others
    to follow, and would make it easy for web designers to find type designers who
    will do custom work, allow linking, and not expect a substantial increase in the
    fee."
