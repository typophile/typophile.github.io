    they're using a typeface called IFFR Grotesk, so most probably exclusive for the
    festival.\r\nAccording to this [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/hello_kitty.php|article]],
    the company in charge of this redesign is [[http://www.75b.nl/commissioned/IFFR.php|75BL]].
    Try to contact them, they could probably answer it."
