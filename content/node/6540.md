body: I&#39;ve been a member of the Typophile audience for quite some time, and though
  maybe I&#39;d enter the arena with a pixel font, it&#39;s kinda up my ally. This
  is where one sketch headed. I don&#39;t know what to do from here. I see there are
  necessary changes to be made, the &#39;s,&#39; for example, could use some tweaking.
  <BR> <BR>I though I&#39;d keep it small, a six bit x-height, because that&#39;s
  a great strength of pixel fonts, and a challenge I thought I&#39;d like. Is it working?
  Is it worth it&#39;s weight in kilobites? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48267.jpg"

  body: How about these character replacements? I thought I&#39;d stay a step ahead
    and fix stuff before anyone even sees this thread! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48270.jpg"

  body: I&#39;m no expert on pixel fonts, but I&#39;d say that in your original concept,
    either your e&#39;s are top-heavy, your  <BR>s&#39;s are bottom-heavy, or both.
    &#40;The middle of the word &#34;hopelessly&#34; emphasizes the disparity.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Just looking at the set, it looks like the font wants to be a bit top-heavy
    - you didn&#39;t rethink the o, and  <BR>most of the other letters seem to be
    ambivalent. The word &#34;six&#34; makes it look like your s is upside- <BR>down,
    too. I&#39;d keep the old c for a bit, switch to the middle e, and try to redesign
    the s to match them  <BR>as much as possible. Then let&#39;s see another sample.
    It&#39;s always hard to judge a letter in isolation. <BR> <BR>As for your second
    font, maybe a second thread, just so things don&#39;t get confused?

  body: all good ideas, I&#39;m at work now, I&#39;ll repost later! <BR>Good call
    on the &#39;s,&#39; it&#39;s pretty off.

  body: I think it&#39;s pretty original, and that&#39;s hard to do at that size &#40;in
    1-bit&#41;. But I&#39;d either make the ascenders one pixel taller or the descenders
    one pixel shorter. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: BTW, you know what&#39;s really crappy about the original Chicago-12pt font?
    The &#34;g&#34;, &#34;j&#34; and &#34;y&#34; go lower than the &#34;p&#34; and
    &#34;q&#34;. Gag me with a bowl. <BR> <BR>hhp

    just taller&#41; ascenders, and a few adjustments to fix the letters mentioned
    above.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48582.jpg" alt="Fractured
