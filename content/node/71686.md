    another (completely different) slab-serif."

  body: "'circumcised' -- ouch! Yes, you're right Florian, and it looks like it was
    painful for the font too. It's funny how serif-ectomies can change the feel so
    much. Oh, look! They added a serif to the E, almost like serif conservation.\r\n\r\nI
    admit I didn't realize this was a mutilated Lubalin Graph, or I would have commented
    on that. This one is borderline piracy at best. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    can choose herself whether she really wants to go with that crippled thingy. (By
    the way, if you find Lubalin Graph\u2019s serifs to big, there\u2019s always its
