body: Having a problem exporting my font from FontLab. I've updated my font to include
  new characters, and everything is exporting fine, but all of the new work I've done
  on kerning pairs is not exporting. It's still using the default Metrics. Is there
  any way of changing this?

    good program. Just today it crashed while I was making an 'e'. I did nothing of
    interest, but FontLab Studio decided to crash anyway. So, take FontLab with a
    grain of salt."

  body: Have you updated your OpenType KERN feature? If this is metrics machine kerning,
    have you check that the imported KERN feature is still there? And have you checked
    that the kerning is still in the font? Have you opened up the Fontlab manual and
    reviewed the relevant section of the chapter on preparing and generating final
    fonts?

    blame Fontlab for this one?"

  body: ">do you remember that FontLab Studio is not a very good program\r\n\r\nCompared
    to what? It seems to be the best one for developing fonts, though it has a lot
    of limitations and problems, as the FontLab folks would I'm sure acknowledge,
    as they are working on improvements. \r\n\r\nHow does it compare to other programs
    with similar complexity and a similarly small user base? That would be a fair
    comparison. \r\n\r\nNow there are add-ons and the UFO based stuff such as Metrics
    Machine to improve on it. "

  body: "Not an answer to your question, but I have to defend FontLab a little bit
    here :) I think FontLab is a great application. I've used it for a couple of years
    now producing many fonts \u2013 and only had small, small problems now and then,
    which I also have with other application btw. Often these problems can be easily
    solved and many times they arrives from something wrong I did myself. Or by adding
    some third party macro which was not really clean. Since FonLab is very much open
    to modification by the users (like modifying databases and such), it's hard to
    say where the problems actually come from, FontLab \u2013 or the user.\r\n\r\nThat's
    my two cents anyway."
