body: "So, after spending the last couple years on my first font family, I am extremely
  close to releasing it, except for the fact that PS hinting is making my brain explode.
  \r\n\r\nI've figured out how to use the Adobe Font Development Kit for autohinting,
  but from my understanding, if you don't have good standard stems set up, the autohinting
  doesn't really help too much.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, what is the proper way to
  calculate the standard stem, and is there any sort of way to automate this? Even
  if there is a script that will do it to a decent level seems like something that
  would work better than my current understanding.\r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot
  showing how poorly my font is rendering on screen... (as you can see, the characters
  are hopping all around as if they were on a trampoline).\r\n\r\nAt this point, any
  help whatsoever will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    dealing with this over the last week or two, I realized my descender alignment
    zone (like for my /g/) was under the primary zone column, and by moving it to
    the secondary zone column in Fontlab it now looks 10x better!"

  body: "FontLab can fill in the stem weights automatically if you click the 'auto
    stems' button in the hinting settings page of font info. However, you ideally
    need as few as possible, so I'd recommend measuring the lowercase stem widths
    (horizontal and vertical) with the ruler and putting these in. If uppercase has
    significantly different weights you can add those secondarily.\r\n\r\nIt looks
    like you need to adjust your alignment zones a bit too; make sure they include
    all overshoots, and need to be entered in ascending numerical order (as you note,
    primary zones pull overshoots down, except the baseline and secondary zones pull
    overshoots up, like with the descenders)."
