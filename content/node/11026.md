  body: The Font could be used by bands on the record and or merch. It could be used

  body: 'I need  to ask for everyones help. I am thinking of coming up with a different
    name. I would like it to start with X if possible as that is my favorite character
    in my design. I would also like it to stay with the punk theme if possible or
    anything clever. Xploited maybe, just straight up X? '
