body: 'I&#39;m working on a project for a senior class at my school. The project is
  about typography and fine art. I&#39;m designing three alphabets and painting them
  onto a canvas, to make the point that typography is a fine art.  <BR> <BR>My professor
  is asking that we find ten &#39;contemporary&#39; artists that are doing what we&#39;re
  doing. So do any of you know of people who are treating type as a fine art. ie incorporating
  it into painting, sculpture or anything like that. Something beyond simply designing
  a font.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked around and I haven&#39;t really seen much of this,
  but if you know of anyone who is doing this I&#39;d greatly appreciate your input.  <BR>
  <BR>If you have any questions about what I mean exactly feel free to ask as well.
  Thanks! '

  body: Ifyour looking for present day artist then I think the list will be fairly
    short. I think a good look at any typographic book will give you a long list of
    artists such as the cubists &#40;Picaso and Braque&#41;, The futurists &#40;Bella,
    Cara and Severini&#41; most importantly Fillippo Tommaso &#40;&#34;words in freedom&#34;&#41;
    Marinetti. Then look at modernists like, El lissitsky &#40;who created &#39;of
    two squares&#39; typographical &#34;paintings&#34;&#41;. Constructavists Alaxandr
    Rodchenko. De stijl and Dada Theo Van Doesberg. The Bauhaus, Kurt Schwitters,
    Moholy Nagy, Lissitski and other modernists like Piet Zwart and Vilmos Haszar.
    You may also find that looking at some of hte graphis typographic manuals will
    give you a better modern approach and na incling of some more artistic renditions.
    I used to love the work of an excellent japanese sculpture/designer who&#39;s
    sculptural brushed steel work I would class as art but his name has been lost
    to time... I think it was something like, Takanobu Igerashi? you&#39;ve got me
    onto a subject I love, so I&#39;ll find out ond get back to you.

  body: paul, if you could find the japanese guy&#39;s name I&#39;d greatly appreciate
    it. I&#39;m really interested in sculpting letterforms in metal, but I haven&#39;t
    done it yet. So if I could see someone else&#39;s work who is/was doing that type
    of work that would be excellent!  <BR> <BR>thanks!

    kinds of aristic lettering. <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/withrington/delve/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/person/withrington/delve/</a> <BR> <BR>I
    also remember this guy &#40;once mentioned by Tiffany or Tanya, either here or
    on Typographica&#41; that took famous old paintings and added huge 3D letters
    into the scenery - but I don&#39;t remember his name. <BR> <BR>Lastly, our Ole
    Sorensen has made some 300-pound metal letters. <BR> <BR>BTW, the Japanese guy
    you want is probably Takenobu Igarashi. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Consider the role that lettering played in some of the work of Jasper Johns.
    He was using vernacular stencil letters, as opposed to designing an alphabet himself,
    but some of his large alphabet paintings are remarkable in their exploration of
    two-dimensional space. One example:<a href="http://www.popartuk.com/art/0-through-9-tsa961-print.asp"
    target="_blank">&#34;0 through 9&#34;</a>, maybe not the best; I can&#39;t find
    any images online of his large, alphabet canvases. <BR> <BR>Although not what
    you&#39;re specifically asking about, I suspect, you might also take a look at
    the work of <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/16701.html" target="_blank">Jack
    Stauffacher</a>, a typographer and printer who has explored letterforms as pure
    shape in compositions that he creates using old wood types. <BR> <BR>Almost completely
    unrelated to your exporation, but worth mentioning as a tangent, Beatrice Riese
    created a series of marvelous abstract, all-over compositions in pencil, each
    named for a different typeface. One example: <a href="http://www.uwrf.edu/history/prints/women/beatriceriese.html"
    target="_blank">&#34;Syntax, Souvenir, Symbol&#34;</a> &#40;a lo-res scan can&#39;t
    do justice to the work, unfortunately&#41;.'

    not a bad gues after ten years of not seeing his work. But yes very inspirational
    use of typographic forms to create truely original architectural sculprure.
