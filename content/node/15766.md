body: "I am trying to find a reference to the first publication of Goudy's <em>The
  Type Speaks</em>. I wonder if anybody knows. Was it originally published by Lanston
  Monotype Co. in Philadelphia? If so, when? One good reference I have here is, <a
  href=\"http://www.jumpingfrog.com/images/epm05jul18/epm2641.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The
  Type Speaks</em></a>, by Frederic W. Goudy (Chicago/Utica, NY: Black Cat Press,
  1937; 93 copies, hand-set by Howard Coggeshall and Norman W Forgue and printed at
  HC's press. 5 x 7 1/2 in., 8-page string-tied booklet). Also, <em>The Type Speaks</em>,
  by Frederic W. Goudy (Washington: The Press of the Three Bears, 1938). But that's
  about it...\r\n"

  body: According to to Bruckner (Frederic Goudy (Masters of American Design) Harry
    N Abrams 1990), it was first printed in 1931 and later in several formats and
    typefaces. There is an illustration of one version from 1933 printed as a keepsake
    for the AIGA. It allegedly was Goudy's favorite broadside.

  body: Thank you Richard. So 1931 was the date of the original publication. By whom?
    By Lanston Monotype Co. in Philadelphia? What does your book say?

    of a Lanston printing of this.
