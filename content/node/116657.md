  body: "Looks like a version of the circa 1900 DeVinne design. Not to be confused
    with current digital fonts sold under the name DeVinne, which are a different
    design. The DeVinne font was very popular and many widths and weights were produced.\r\nFor
    a digital variation of condensed De Vinne  see Hawthorne:\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/similar?6EF\r\nA
    regular width version of DeVinne was recently digitized by Jeff Levine as Publication:

    type fonts:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/\r\nThe De
