body: Once again, I have to work with an existing brand and I have no access to anyone
  involved with the business. Can anyone identify the font that &#34;Cabo Wabo&#34;
  is set in? Or give me a hint towards a font that I can use that will appear similar
  enough to an undiscerning web audience?  <BR> <BR>Thank you very much! <BR> <BR><img
