But anyway the problem might be GLC (even if MyFonts is OK with it). On the other hand, it seems that the free version isn't as complete as the commercial one (which means the commercial version is usually worth it).

BTW, before recommending a font it might be useful to follow the links a bit.

Steve, it's strange that you only ever find a problem with my stance, and never with that of people who clearly couldn't care less about type itself.

Uli, that doesn't mean Jenson's type was not used. For example Granjon's Armenian fonts were used for about 200 years.

The problem is not with your stance. I pretty much agree with you. Your posts about outline theft, pirated copies, and rip-offs are well taken. Mostly your posts are directed at a few people in IDing contests who are not as passionate as you in the sourcing or origin of the fonts.

You've made your point to them many, many times. Don't you think they understand your point by now? Will saying the same thing to the same people over and over again produce different results?

Also you are shifting the burden to the IDers to make sure they're naming a legitimate copy. Why don't you do a little checking before disparaging fonts and IDers? Why don't you start a list of illegitimate fonts? And more than once innocent posters looking for an ID, some newcomers, got caught in the crossfire.

I'd just like someone with your knowledge and passion to take the rant out of Hrant. Don't give up your principles; just give up being a nag that just incurs the ire of others. And who wants to see a thread about a font ID with more posts about (il)legitmacy (real or imagined)  than about the font itself?</div>

But I don't believe you care about me looking bad. I think what your removal of the offending font reference did is save <em>you</em> embarrassment. You're not getting away pretending that nothing was going wrong. And here's a crazy idea: when I do make a "true accusation", don't look the other way - especially when you actually edit your post as a result!

As for trying to change Dafont: what kind of crazy talk is that? I'm having a hell of a time changing <em>Typophile!</em> I've said a dozen times that I'm not on some delusional crusade to eradicate piracy or plagiarism - I'm simply protecting this place.
