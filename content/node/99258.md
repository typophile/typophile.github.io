  body: "Nick - this is meant in the spirit of constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nEvery
    time I see one of your recreations of a photo lettering font, I'm at first excited
    to see that a quality version now exists digitally - and then disappointed that
    you opt to pick and choose between the original's default and alternate characters.
    Why not include them all and make your offering so much more useful?\r\n\r\nIn
    this case, the poster cannot use your font to recreate the second image because
    he/she needs both (very different) versions of several caps.\r\n\r\nThe price
    you ask makes for incredible value, but what's the point if the user requires
    characters found in the original font that aren't in yours? I suppose that's not
    very common, but still ...\r\n\r\nWhat if you put the alternates in a second font
    \ (relatively easy to do) and offered both for, in this case, $10.95 or so?\r\n\r\nJust
    my one cent worth ..."

  body: Nice one, guys, thanks! Solid business advice from Mike there as well. Separate
    swashy version is certainly a good practice.

    plain, swash, wide, and wide swash vairiants. The fonts are anonymous, with no
    copyright or creator information. In the copyright field they say \"aka Romanopolis

    Standard, by Mickey Rossi]](subflux.com). It contains both regular and swash A-z
