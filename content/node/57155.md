  body: "I think it's probably custom, but it looks similar to an old film type script
    called Yale Script. It's possible this was drawn using Yale Script as a reference
    point. The place I saw Yale Script was in a German book of Script Types by Michael
    Rau & Rosemarie Kloos-Rau. The double-loop B is pretty distinctive and matches
    fairly well with Yale Script. The lower case in your sample exaggerates the connection
    dots, but they are present in Yale.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
