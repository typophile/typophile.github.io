body: "Hi, I am new here, so please have patience ;) thanks\r\n\r\nMy company would
  like to start a new magazine. It will be readable from both sides - one half is
  for men and one half for women. You have to turn it around and upside down to view
  the other side (if you understand what I mean).\r\nAnyway. I am something like a
  manager of this project and our \"art director\" sucks. I tried to find some solution,
  because we are close to deadline. I know that it also sucks (but believe me - it
  is better). I am not graphic and there is no typography involved, but I hope, that
  you will help me to improve the general image and the \"face\" of the magazine and
  layout...\r\n\r\nHere are first three pages, that will be used for text-type pages\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "With strana-velky-foto.jpg you reveal one of the problems of including the
    graphic by changing text color: as the columns rewrap, the shape can get distorted.
    I don't much care for changing the text color as it also introduces readability
    issues, but if you must do it try overlaying a translucent graphic object over
    the text instead of changing the text color. With that, you'll run into the problem
    of a few letters being only partially changed, but you will save a lot of time
    over resetting the text color letter by letter.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it isn't
    a <i>bad</i> layout, but it is indeed a rather boring one, more appropriate to
    a serious medical journal than a lifestyle magazine."

  body: "I agree with jason's assessment, particularly regarding the graphic/text
    relationship. \r\nAlthough I might suggest the translucent graphic BEHIND the
    text instead of in front.\r\n You may also rethink the elements in the open column
    to the left. I get the feeling that by rrunning the author credit at the top of
    the column and the one column photo at the bottom, you're negating the openness
    of the layout. Instead, it might be worth trying to group the author credits and
    the secondary image closer together, and letting the free space fall to the bottom
    left. It will really open the page up more.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/strana_6637.jpg]"

  body: I agree with Chuck re the rivers of space caused by not hyphenating. This,
    in narrow justified text columns is very unsightly. Actually I don't care for
    the male/female symbol behind or in front of text at all. It takes away from the
    text and meaning. It is simply too obtrusive. Why not a little symbol, light in
    color, in the open column under the caption or at bottom of page. Does it have
    to be so obvious?

  body: 'Jordy is right in saying the male/female symbols seem heavy-handed, esp.
    since you''re already using them (more gently) in the section headings (see: modakoncept).
    Unless you really need to drive it home which side (venus-mars) we''re reading.
    But as Hrant suggests, using differing faces could do the same thing with perhaps
    more communication, such as a sans serif for masculine and serif for feminine
    sides...'

    that's much better\r\n\r\nhyphenation - as i said - this was only a picture created

    are right. i will try to think of a better solution\r\n\r\n(more pages to come;)

    \r\n\r\nI should have added: What is wrong with ragged right instead of justified
    columns? This would be the easy way, avoiding rivers of space and using Quark
    cleverly you can avoid too much hyphenation."

  body: I love the images - fantastic. I think I prefer the wider columns and the
    captions in color bars outside of the pictures. I especially like the ragged left
    on the title spread. I'm sure you'll have other comments but I do love the images,
    they provide the focus for the text. The simple symbol is fine, font choices work
    well. I especially like Franklin Gothic Heavy for title. It always worked well
    for me.

    try -- just for fun -- something like Rotis? http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rotis-sans-serif/\r\nOr
    maybe the Letter Gothic would work better as slanted? I'm not sure. I just feel
    the word spacing is maybe too weird with the Letter.\r\nI'm with jordy on the
    images. Very lively."

    However, I would go for a thicker title bar and make the photo''s caption slightly
