  body: Nope -- R has a higher waiste, and S structure is different. Dunno what it

  body: "I know you guys hate these answers, but <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr/\">Block
    Gothic Extra Bold Cond</a> with a 20 degree slant, with widening and flattening
    looks almost identical. I suspect many other somewhat squarish sans could also
    fill this need, if you just want a quick look-alike. (Pragmatism is good too,
    I'd say.)\r\n\r\n(edit - if I could still attach pictures, like in the old days,
    I could show you, but we've 'improved' the system, so that older operating systems
    can not have this ability. gripe, gripe, grumble...)\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    and sheared.
