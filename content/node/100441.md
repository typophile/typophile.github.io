    sent me a portfolio that included one of my favorite art-director-and-client cartoons
    ever. It shows a pirate captain seated at a table surrounded by his pirate crew.
    Across the table, a man is holding up a picture of a skull and crossbones. In
    the caption, the pirate captain says, "Sure, it's a nice bold graphic, but does
    it really say 'piracy'?"

  body: "Real pirates, like most criminals, were probably careful to avoid using fonts
    of any kind, lest they create a paper trail of their activities.\r\n\r\nThe pirates
    depicted in books and movies are based on 19th-Century stories about the pirates
    who preyed on merchant vessels in the Atlantic and Caribbean in the 17th and early
    18th Centuries. My guess is that 19th and 20th-Century publishers used blackletter
    fonts for the titles of these stories for much the same reason they used them
    for stories about Robin Hood or the Knights of the Round Table. At least in English-speaking
    countries, blackletter is often used to cue readers that the story took place
    a long, long time ago. \r\n\r\nI'd like to think that if Adobe had been around
    350 years ago, pirates would have used Photoshop.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dither_4474.jpg]"

  body: Why do you think they used blacketter (or anything else, for that matter)?
    The only blackletter Pirate "Logos" I know of are for contemporary software pirates.
    In fact, I can't think of anybody like Blackbeard even having anything you'd consider
    to be a 'logo', except for their ships' flags, mostly black or variations of the
    skull and crossbones.

  body: That's quite possible, and other pop culture things besides liquor labels
    likely played a part as well. I was doing some searching, and the time of Blackbeard,
    for example, coincided with the use of Caslon itself, not the significantly different
    types which preceded it by two centuries.

    have little doubt that these notorious captains were well educated and knew a
    thing or two about expressive penmanship.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is more likely that
    if blackletter is to be  strongly associated with pirates it is due to the periodicals
    of the day such as in my above post, and not used by the captains themselves.
    But, having looked into this most intriguing matter a little further there was
    for a brief time a pirate's government formed. Located in the Caribbean it must
    of had some form of printed material, perhaps even a charter of independence.
    Whether or not such material used blackletter or even exaggerated swashes as above
    I would really like to see. \r\n\r\nn.  \r\n\r\n"
