  body: Do you have any more letters? G, J, especially, and any lower case? <BR> <BR>The
    M, N, 2 and R are about the only useful letters here. Some of us might be good
    enough to &#39;name that font&#39; with four letters, but I&#39;m not usually
    one of them.

  body: 'Mark,  Something went wrong with your image. Is this for the same font that
    Chris asked about?  <BR> <BR>&#40;If not, please open a new thread.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Here is a possible substitute if we don&#39;t guess this mystery font: Burin
    Sans with some squeezing &#40;75% width&#41;. Sorry, purists, I know you find
    this offensive, but it&#39;s just a compromise suggestion in case we don&#39;t
    nail the right font. &#40;Is it possible this image comes from a fax and the M
    and N are distorted?&#41; <BR> <BR>Of course, the bottom image is my simulation
    using Burin Sans, from Monotype Engravers 1 package. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65644.gif"

  body: Mark,  <BR> <BR>Your square font might be the lower case of <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=megaton&amp;text=CLOSEFONTS"
    target="_blank">Megaton</a> by DustBust.  <BR> <BR>There are so many square fonts,
    it could be any of several others from DustBust, from what I saw on DaFOnt.com
