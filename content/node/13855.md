body: I have identified this font as "Skin & Bones", apparently a VGC font designed
  by Douglas F. Jones. I have not been able to purchase it anywhere. Does anyone have
  any idea where this font can be purchased. "BuyFonts.com" has it under the name
  "Skinny" for Windows machines, but I need it for Mac.

  body: "Buyfonts.com sells the old Fontbank collection and I think that their 'Skinny'
    is about as legitimate a version as you are going to find.\r\n\r\nOther versions
    I've seen have been Duo Line by Weatherly Systems (WSI) and Twinkie Display by
    Southern Software SSi). Both were wholesalers of ripoff clone fonts and, at least
    in SSi's case, are pretty much out of business because of that. I mention these
    only because it seems like they had Mac versions of \"their\" fonts.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me, too, that there is font conversion software out there that, for Mac
    users anway, is free. Another option."
