  so much nicer than Platelet. I searched around a bit online... but... It's not Propane,
  Speedlearn, Dirk Uhlenbrock\u2019s Mass, or typografski's Designer's Cut.\r\n\r\nIt
  has a rounded 'A', but the M, N, W, F, and E have angles to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maya_font3_6143.png]"

    \r\n\r\nHard to tell since it's all caps, but I'd lean more on the Base 12 Sans
