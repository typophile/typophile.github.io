body: "Making a specimen. What's the easiest way to paste every glyph in a font to
  InDesign or the like? The closest I've come is:\r\n- Select all glyphs in Fontlab\r\n-
  Open a metrics window\r\n- Select all in that main metrics window pane and Copy\r\n-
  Paste into InD\r\n\r\nThis gets me most of the way there but some glyphs don't appear
  (replaced by a colored box) - I think it's the ones that don't have Unicode assignments
  (alternate characters, small caps, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?"

  body: "I haven't used Fontlab before, so I'm not sure what's required in \"saving\"
    a font, and I'm probably making the most obvious statement which has 100 good
    reasons why it doesn't work - but - couldn't you just install the font on your
    system and then type it regularly?\r\n\r\nThoughts on Type: http://www.sthursby.com/blog"

  body: I set the entire thing up manually once and I now just keep adding and tweaking
    it as character sets grow. If you have Metrics Machine you could always generate
    a text file with it and import that into Indesign.

  body: I'll assume you always generate and install the font before trying this. To
    easily grab the full set. Do an OT or TT test. Tools/Quick Test As. In the test
    window, display all characters, select all copy/paste in to Photoshop or whatever.
    That's how I make the samples on Typodermic.com give or take a few redundant glyphs.

  body: "I did something similar to what James did... I set up a document in InDesign
    and opened the Glyphs palette... That will show you every character in your typeface,
    allowing you to double-click on the ones that haven't been showing up and pasting
    them into a textbox. You can also choose different Unicode sets, like Basic Latin
    and Latin 1, Extended Latin A, etc. It's time-consuming the first time, then you
    just add to it or tweak it, as James says.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glyphs_6436.png]"

  body: Eric Menninga wrote an InDesign script for me that grabs all the glyphs from
    a font and puts them into a story. This approach captures all the glyphs, not
    just the directly encoded ones, so is useful for getting a quick grab of everything
    in the font. Eric mentioned that he might make this script publicly available,
    so I will direct his attention to this discussion.

  body: I've just made an InDesign document once, I got the whole characterset I generally
    use both by using the glyph palette and copy-pasting, and just saved that document
    and use it every time I need the charset. Only have to do that once, and just
    expand it if the typeface you are displaying has more characters.

  body: 'The trick is that you can describe an arbitrary glyph (one without an unicode
    mapping) using tagged text, so my script would create a tagged text file with
    all glyphs from 1-1000. AFAIK, scripting doesn''t have direct access to arbitrary
    glyphs directly. '

  body: "If it were possible to convert from a list of glyphs formatted like so:\r\n\r\nU+0020-U+007E
    U+00A0-U+00FF U+02C6 U+02D9-U+02DA\r\n\r\nGetting them out of Fontforge is easy.
    But unfortunately I think it would work only about as well as \"Quick Test\" in
    Fontlab\u2014only display glyphs with a unicode value. Unfortunately I don't have
    InDesign, only Illustrator, so the Macro wont work for me. Even OSX's \"Special
    Characters\" dialogue will not let you select multipe glyphs to insert. If I remember
    properly, the \"Character Map\" in Windows lets you do this. Microsoft pulled
    one on you this time, Apple.\r\n\r\nI'm going to have to see about Libr\xE9 tools
    on this one."
