  I have a couple of FontLab-documents/templates.\r\n\r\n\u2022 They all consists
  of empty glyphs connected to OpenType-script-code so I can just draw the characters
  inte their given places-\r\n\r\n\u2022 One template-document could cover a basic
  font\_\u2014 and then up to a very advanced OpenType-featured document with full
  set of everything that is possible with Opentype.\r\n\r\nIf this is available, I
  could concentrate on the design only \u2014 and the code would already be written.
  The glyphs would be named etc.\r\n\r\nDoes it exist?\r\n\r\n=)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes it does (I think FreeFont Pro).  You should have gotten it when you bought
    FL5.  It is one of the freefonts.  The boxes are not blank but all you need do
    is duplicate the file and replace the glyphs in it with your own drawings.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Yes, I got this document freefontpro.vfb.\r\n\r\nDoes this cover ALL features?\r\n\r\nI
    was however thinking of a more \"structured\" system of templates with maybe different
    sets of features, so \u2013 if I just want the regular characters + lets say swashes\_\u2013
    a document/template would already be there (aswell as thirty more templates for
    other purposes)\r\n\r\nIn this freefont \u2013 If I just want some of the features,
    I have to sit and take away a lot of things.\r\n\r\nI guess it's about saving
    time and effort, and instead focus on the design process.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a
    good business idea? =) To make templates for FontLab, I mean.\r\n\r\n"

    FontLab, just TypeTool--but purely for information's sake: \r\n\r\nIf it's just
    that easy to use Freefont as a template for new OT fonts, what would prevent people
    from creating OT fonts from their existing T1 and TT fonts? There must be a reason
    why foundries take so long to come out with the OT versions of their catalog.

  body: "It is not that easy actually. It certainly is easier if you have drawn all
    the glyphs already for say an expert set and multi-lingual sets. by adding a few
    hundred glyphs, you have multiplied the kerning requirements quite a bit. You
    have to adjust all the fontmetrics as well. If you have lots of combining to do
    with diacritics, your job is even bigger.\r\nThere is nothing to prevent people
    from making OTF fonts from T1 or ttf fonts as long as the EULA permits it but
    that is a big if. Thieves and pirates probably do what you said but they are probably
    more likely to just steal a font and redestribute it to avoid all the work.  My
    theory is that thieves are thieves because they are too lazy to do the work themselves.\r\nFoundries
    may have thousands of fonts in their catalogs as well as new ones coming out.
    Foundries these days don't have big staffs so they have to prioritize what to
    do first. It may sound simple but try it.  You will be surprised how much work
    is involved after all the outlines are drawn and done.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: "Chris:\r\n\r\nSo, if I understand right, all using FL's Freefont Pro as
      a template does is to save you the trouble of generating all the OT features
      from scratch. You still have to (re)do all the kerning and metrics yourself.\r\n\r\nWell,
      that would deter me if I were a pirate. It seems like combining even fonts with
      low glyph counts with their pro sets would be pretty time-consuming, even if
      you cribbed some of the content for the new tables from the orginal tables.
