  do you subscribe to in regards to proper use of small caps? For instance, I noticed
  that the Atlantic Monthly uses full caps for three letters or fewer; small caps
  for four letters or more.\r\n\r\nDoes the use of italics change anything? (Yes,
  I unfortunately need to set something in caps *and* italics. Even in small caps
  it looks a bit funky, but a lot less funky than in full caps.)\r\n\r\nWhich, I reckon,
  is the final rule: which looks better?\r\n\r\nBut, lacking a style rule (or at least
  I couldn't find anything relevant in the Chicago Manual of Style), I thought I'd
  solicit opinions here.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n__\r\n\r\nDavid"

    the basic opinions are outlined.\r\n\r\nI feel it all depends on the publication
    and the type. Some faces have small caps of varying height. Some people will set
    a three letter acronym in SC. What face are you using and what is the range of
    possible usage in the publication?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/12543\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the link to that thread. I did do a search before I posted, for
    what it's worth, although I admit I was a wee bit impatient sorting through it.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    face is LTC Deepdene. It's actually in the acknowledgments page of a poetry book,
    so it's small-ish (9 pt.) and there aren't all caps/small caps occurrences anywhere
    else in the book.\r\n\r\nThat said, on the same page is a three-letter all-cap,
    and for that I'm keeping full caps. For the longer word (seven character) I'm
    99% sold on small caps, with 10/1000-em tracking (which is probably conservatively
    tight, but it works--a reminder here that the text is set in italics, as that's
    proportionately relevant).\r\n\r\nGranted, too, it is, in effect, \"fine print,\"
    but thought it was as good a time as any to solicit opinions.\r\n__\r\n\r\nDavid"
