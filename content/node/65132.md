  used for \"The Whitlams\" in the image below. I'm also curious about the \"Sydney
  Symphony\" logo in the top left corner and the yellow text \"and the Sydney Symphony\"
  if they could be ID'ed as well, but \"The Whitlams\" is the most important.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitlams_5478.JPG]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help you can give! :D"
