  body: 'Bingo. Markham appears to be Adobe Bickham Script Swash Caps. <BR> <BR>I
    have to attribute this ID to RF on the MyFonts forum, but ... he/she <BR>only
    said Bickham Script MM. It took a lot of hunting to find a view of <BR>the Swash
    Caps font. <BR> <BR>Forget about <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1421.jhtml"
    target="_blank"> Adobe&#39;s</a> own site. I guess now that they don&#39;t support
    <BR>the Multiple Master technology any more, the MM fonts went out the <BR>window?
    <BR> <BR>Forget also Phils Fonts and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=408351"
    target="_blank"> Fonts.com</a>. <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=ADT0000435"
    target="_blank"> Veer</a> appears to carry the <BR>Swash Caps font, but doesn&#39;t
    show it to us &#40;sorry Grant, but Veer&#39;s <BR>previews leave much unseen&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I finally turned to the resource we know and love '
