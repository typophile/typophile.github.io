    fonts in terms of glyph coverage.

  body: "bahman - ycherem, Thanx for the comments;\r\n\r\nI hope this will be a good
    addition in existing Quranic Fonts. This is specially designed to view the Quranic
    Text according to Uthmanic Script and exactly as printed in Mushaf AlMadinah.\r\n\r\nWe
    also tried our best to remove the clashes of Dots and Tashkeel with the text.
    i.e. the Tashkeel & dots will not touch the base character.\r\n\r\nAlso We are
    providing Authenticated data of Quraan from King Fahd Glorious Quran Printing
    Complex. The Line and Page breaks are exactly as they appear in Mushaf AlMadinah.\r\n\r\nWe
    tried to place Tashkeel at their best possible place."

  body: "Ashfaq, the font is beautiful, thank you.\r\n\r\nBut, I'm not sure how useful
    DOC file will be in real-world usage (except for displaying quranic text on Windows
    with MS Office installed). DOC format isn't reliable, especially if used on OSes
    other than Windows and within apps other than MS Word (e.g., OpenOffice.org or
    LibreOffice on Linux have problems with displaying text correctly; same applies
    to XeLaTeX). And if one is about to typeset parts of quranic text, then an application
    like Zekr ([[http://zekr.org]]) is a must (I mentioned Zekr here because it's
    truly cross-platform). Unfortunately, this font doesn't play well with Zekr neither
    :( I'd like to hear comments from Mac OS users, but on Linux, usage of the font
    is quite limited. It's OK for typesetting common arabic, but not for quranic script,
    for which it's created in the first place.\r\n\r\n[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/171954/Fonts/Uthmanic%20Hafs/UthmanicHafs-LibreOffice.jpeg|LibreOffice
