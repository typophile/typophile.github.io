- body: 'It&#39;s sweet! <BR> <BR>the friendly fleabag! <BR> <BR>I think the typography,
    which seems to imitate a xylographic technique, could benefit from being more
    rough on the edges and less photoshop-blurrish &#40;in particular the &#39;R&#39;&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>otherwise, as I said '

    some of the marks more &#34;authentic&#34;. But it is a cute image.

  body: 'Haha. It&#39;s great! <BR> <BR>Picky things that I might adjust: 1&#41; the
    nose highlight seems too close to the edge, 2&#41; the nose and eyes seem too
    smooth compared to the rest of the form, 3&#41; could the bottom of the &#34;E&#34;
    be thickened slightly?, 4&#41; I like how his foot is sitting on the &#34;Q&#34;,
    but I&#39;m not fond of the trapped negative space. Could his front leg be moved
    to compensate?'

  body: Why do you need to choose? I would do 3 variations and alternate them on the
    applications. As long as the type treatment is consistent, you will not have a
    problem with branding. Version 2 looks as if he is peeing on the T. Was that the
    intention? He looks quite guilty. Very funny. <BR> <BR>Seriously though, I would
    do 3 different variations of the doggy interacting with the type. Maybe with one
    he is licking the Q! <BR> <BR>Be careful with scale also. He seems a little large
    in relation to the type.
