  for the poor quality of the image.\r\n\r\nI need to identify the font in which the
  name, the subjects, and the acores etc... have been written(in image 3).\r\n\r\nThis
  font has obviously been created by a kind of printer that is not used these days.
  Therefore am having difficulty finding fonts to compare it with. I tried Identifont
  and Whatthefont and failed.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any help with this a lot."
