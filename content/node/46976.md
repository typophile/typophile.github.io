  liked the looks of Mrs Eaves. It's likely target audience is going to be female.
  But everything I've read here suggests that the poor spacing in the font makes it
  less than desirable to work with for a full book. Does anyone have suggestions for
  another font that might have the same sort of character or liveliness of Eaves without
  the wonky spacing. I suggested Jenson and that was almost accepted but now they
  want to go back to Eaves.\r\n\r\nAnd am I correct in assuming that the OTF version
  has the same spacing problems? I have the postscript version and ended up using
  optical kerning in InDesign with tracking applied in the sample we were playing
  with.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for all suggestions.\r\n\r\nJohn"

    Atma</a>, my favorite alternative to Mrs. Eaves, was just released in OpenType.
    It has much of the vintage <em>Transitional</em> character of Mrs. Eaves and similar
    features like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/features/fontmag/002/02_atma/">three
    sizes of caps</a> along with corresponding punctuation.

    Typetool because I had not really needed it. Maybe I'll buy it now.\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe I should just buy a new font instead..."

    then! God I hate the anti-Quark bias on this forum. InDesign is a great app and
    easier to use and master than Quark but until it has kerning tables I have to
    say that for typesetting Quark still rules.\r\n\r\nI love Atma! It's on my wishlist
    (has been for awhile). Just waiting for the right project for it."

  body: It's nice to hear Quark is adding those niceties, but that's really only two
    Quark advantages in contrast to many more, and arguably larger, advantages on
    InDesign's side, not the least of which are Optical Spacing, deeper control of
    style sheets, and the Multiline Composer.

    Indesign has nice features, Quark has not (and vice versa).\r\nHowever I did NOT
    want to count features and which has more.\r\n\r\nMy point is that <strong>Indesign</strong>
    adds features which are production driven (nested styles, multiline composer,
    margin alignments) and <strong>computated by Indesign</strong>;\r\n\r\n<em>whereas
    <strong>Quark</strong> seems to concentrate more on <strong>customizable typography</strong>
    which has to be set by the designer.</em>\r\n\r\nI prefer latter, as I do not
