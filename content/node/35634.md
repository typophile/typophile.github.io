  think it's a woodtype from the 19th century,\r\nand I'm sure it's been digitalized.\r\n\r\nHope
  you guys will be more efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n"

    see you put this up on August 2, and today is the 5th and no one has replied.\r\n\r\nSo,
    perhaps you can accept a substitute - something that is similar but not the same...
    like:\r\nSaddlery: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/saddlery/\r\nRailhead:
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/railhead/\r\n\r\nSorry I couldn't find exact.

    FontMesa was the first place I had given a look."

  body: "Have you looked at the book \"American Wood Type\" by Rob Roy Kelly? This
    has been mentioned numerous times as the best book on the subject.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it's also possible that this is not American (and I think it's more ornate than
    most 'Circus' types), and it may be older than 19th century. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/\">Dieter
    Steffmann</a> has digitized a large number of initial fonts, but unfortunately
    he doesn't show samples all at once, and you need to search each possibility.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "@bowfinpw \r\n\r\nThanks for your interest Mike.\r\n\r\n#1\r\nI'd love to
    look inside that book (I've come across it several times while searching...) but
    I don't have it, and the local libraries either.\r\n#2\r\nThanks also for the
    link, I'll watch this stuff carefully.\r\n#3\r\nI agree with you, I'm beginning
    to doubt it's an American, and it might be older.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm quite sure
    it's been digitized as I've seen it printed at the top of a text set in Futura.\r\n\r\n+"

    given another look at the original image\r\n\r\n#1 my memory was wrong, it was
    near Gill, not Futura (at least your remark remains valid ) \r\n\r\n#2 This F
    has been scanned on a print ad for a nice lamp from a designy furniture store.\r\nthose
    ads need to look like oldstyle, but I'm 90% sure the company that sells the lamps
    did not print those ads with an old printer.\r\n here is the full image :\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_6171.jpg]\r\n\r\n+\r\nPlease,
