  body: "This is the logo from 1961 to 1972. http://logos.wikia.com/wiki/Sprite\r\nThe
    treatment of the lettering in_Sprite_ is very late 1950s early 1960s when \"tipsy\"
    or \"bouncy\" serifs were the height of fashion. \r\nThe Font Diner fonts already
    suggested are good options for substitutes with the  tipsy/bouncy style of the
    era.\r\nHere's a few fonts from Filmotype in the same style:\r\nOrlando:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/orlando/\r\nPanama:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/panama/\r\nParade:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/parade/\r\nAlso
