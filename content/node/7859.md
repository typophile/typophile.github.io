body: Hello again, getting the hang of this place now.  <BR> <BR>My last thread was
  about typographic handling by students but now I want to look back a little at those
  who influence them.  <BR>Two famous names many students look to where radical typography
  is concerned are Why Not Associates and David Carson. Why Not still seem very much
  respected wheras Carson recieves strong criticism. Where then is the line between
  expressive typography and typography which is too irreverent? <BR> <BR>hope that
  makes sense <BR>danielle

    with &#34;illegible&#34; and &#34;unreadable.&#34; Those are the grounds on which
    most of the recent criticism of Carson seems to be based. <BR> <BR>T

  body: IMHO, Typography &#40;and graphic design&#41; must by all and any means communicate
    the intended message to the target audience. Beyond that, the world is open.  <BR>If
    you can enhance communication by decreasing legibility, then this is fair game.  An
    example might be designing a poster for say an optometrist where the headline
    might say &#34;Blurred Vision?&#34; and you were to either use one of the &#34;Blurred&#34;
    fonts or distort the text in PhotoShop yourself.  The technique does not of itself
    seal the deal.  It has to be done well.  This is true of all typographic design.  You
    can follow every rule in Bringhist&#39;s book and still not make a good design.  Text
    can be readable but not effective.  To me, there is a difference between good
    typesetting and good typography. <BR>The major problems come when someone tries
    to mimic a technique that he/she has seen used successfully but without having
    it help convey the message &#40;&#34;If you are not part of the solution then
    you are part of the problem&#34;&#41;.  This is what we used to call &#34;Technique-ee&#34;
    design.  An absurd example might be to use the &#34;Blurred&#34; typeface we had
    successfully seen above in the vision poster and use it for a road sign because
    it was &#34;cool type&#34; or very &#34;hip&#34; or &#34;in&#34; but in the process
    destroyed communication. <BR>The designers task is to solve the communication
    problem to the best of his/her ability. You can do this by pushing the envelope
    or staying safely inside the box.  The key words are &#34;solve communication
    problem&#34;--this is always the measure. <BR>You can argue the merits of Carson&#39;s
    work.  Sometimes he was successful, sometimes not.  It is tough doing a monthly
    magazine and hitting the mark every article every month. In his favor, his audience
    loved it even if many outside that group may not have. <BR>To me Carson was always
    at least a very skilled typographic painter and at his best a good designer as
    well.  The tough part about being famous is that everyone sees all of your work
    and you are open to criticism.  The many of us who dwell in relative obscurity
    are not held up to the light for examination so readily and can choose just our
    best work to show our peers. <BR> <BR>ChrisL
