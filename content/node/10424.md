    so we could take a look at the type.? <BR><i>&#40; Edit.: Huh.? Well, Typophile
    seems to become &#39;A Bugs Life&#39;.. I havent seen your sample, when first

  body: It surely is Verdana. Try playing with the aliasing options in Photoshop.
    <BR>You have &#34;crisp&#34;, &#34;sharp&#34;, and &#34;none&#34; available.

  body: Have you tried setting the type,<i> in &#39;Verdana&#39;</i>, in <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/?promoid=home_prod_fw_082403"
    target="_blank">FireWorks</a>.? <i>&#40; As long as its still available.. &#41;</i>
    <BR><i>&#40; I always thought that FireWorks would render type even nicer than
    PhotoShop.. &#41;</i>

  body: You may try this software.  <BR> <BR>From graphics.com <BR>Microworld claims
    that its new plugin for the Windows version of Photoshop can create clearer type
    output at small point sizes.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no doubt that generating clear
    type output at small point sizes from any image editing application can be a challenge.
    Microworld has come up with a new approach in the form of a Photoshop plugin that
    it believes provides &#34;ultra-clear&#34; font output. It also adds a few extra
    touches, such as the ability to employ a user-defined font directory and provides
    a character map to ease font and symbol selection, with support for multiple languages.  <BR>

  body: From sharp-type.com <BR> <BR>Sharptype uses a distinct method to render font,
    it does not use functional routines provided by operating system, however, it
    optimizes vector information to sharpen the vertical and horizontal lines.
