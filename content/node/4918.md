body: hi <BR> <BR>I seem to keep using arial rounded in my design work, I was wondering
  if anyone can suggest a similar font, as all my work is starting to look the same.

  body: Jim, there is actually a plain version of Arial, with cleanly truncated stems,
    which looks quite &#34;similar&#34; &#40;as you requested&#41; to Arial Rounded.
    <BR> <BR>So, if you were to use that typeface, your work would be different, even
    though it looked the same! <BR> <BR>Best of all, it&#39;s free, so you don&#39;t
    have to pay onerous licensing fees.
