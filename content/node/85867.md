body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create a nested style, which would go something
  like this:\r\n\r\nTitle P (2pm)\r\nTitle Two P (2pm)\r\n\r\nI want to apply a character
  style to the single character (P). \r\n\r\nI tried to do this by running no style
  up to 1 P, then applying the character style through 1 character. It actually worked,
  except when there was a \"P\" in the title. *See attached image.\r\n\r\nAny tips
  on how I could target only the single character \"P\" and not \"P's\" that show
  up in title names??\r\n\r\nThanks, J.\r\n\r\n"

    still haven't wrapped my head around GREP styles, I ought to figure it out..."

  body: "Hi J\r\nI would suggest to use GREP rather than nested styles.\r\nIn Cs5
    you will find it in the paragraph styles - GREP.\r\n\r\nThis will give you the
    possibility to change the letter \"P\"\r\nto a different character style. Im just
    trying to get you\r\nthe GREP code as well.\r\n\r\nEdit: here a code which seems
    to work\r\n\r\n\\sP\\s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey Agostini,\r\n\r\nThanks man! Works like a charm. :) \r\n\r\nI now know
    more about GREP styles than ever before! Very useful, I will definitely have to
    explore the possibilities.\r\n\r\n"
