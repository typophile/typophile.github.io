body: "For those attending the TypoTechnica 2007 conference at the end of this week,
  it might be interesting to know that we will present a new FM module, namely DTL
  CompareMaster, in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nDTL CompareMaster is a tool for comparing the
  outline, metrics and hinting information of fonts / glyph databases. This way different
  fonts, different versions of the same fonts and different platform editions of specific
  fonts can be compared. Also the program provides the opportunity to compare (unwanted)
  adaptations with their origins. This is not only useful for type designers and font
  producers, but for instance also for design agencies and printers.\r\n\r\nCurrently
  the program supports the PostScript Type 1 format for Mac OS and Windows (so, for
  the moment other formats like OT CFF have to be converted first). Output options
  include PostScript plot files and extensive or summarized listings in text format.\r\n\r\nDTL
  CompareMaster was exclusively programmed for and in close co-operation with the
  Dutch Type Library by the Hamburg based company URW++, pioneers in the field of
  font tools development since the early 1970's.\r\n\r\nDTL CompareMaster is available
  for Mac OS X and Windows. "
