  font which looks like Dax.\r\n(It may be rounded. Np.)\r\n\r\nAlso, i need rounded
  version of Helvetica. I have \"Helvetica Rounded\" (Linotype) but i think it is
  too rounded. I need less rounded of \"Helvetica Rounded\".\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nPeace!"

  body: "I wouldn't exactly call Dax humanist, despite what Wiki says.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/shinntype/sensibility\">This</a>
    is a humanist sans.\r\nAnd <a href=\"http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/shinntype/sense\">this</a>,
    like Dax, is a condensed modernist sans.\r\nIn Dax, the elimination of tangential
    lower case joints is modernist, in a reductive manner.\r\n(Both support Turkish,
    BTW.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: A less rounded Helvetica Rounded simply does not exist. Calibri is very nice
    and has slightly rounded curves but isn't Helvetica.
