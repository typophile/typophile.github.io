  body: "I believe this may be a custom(ized) font. That M may be two inverted V's.
    The widths of some letters seem to have been altered. The R is a strange shape
    and may have been drawn by adding a leg to a P. If I were going to try to re-create
    this, assuming no one finds an actual font, I would start with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/bryant/|Bryant]].
    It's basic feeling and letterform shapes are close, and might not take much manipulation
    to match pretty well.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Seb, Just came across another font that has a similar feeling, a sans with
    varied widths. See [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/toasted-vein-btn/|Toasted
    Vein]], a recreation of old tobacco can lettering, I think. You could get a look
    a bit like your sample, without as much work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
