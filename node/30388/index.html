<p>Also, Pietro Bembo was a Venetian Poet and historian, not a type designer. The Monotype typeface Bembo is named for him, but Bembo Roman was based on a roman font designed by Francesco Griffo in 1495. Bembo Italic was based on Blado, which was, in turn, based on a font used by typographer Antonio Blado of Rome, but designed by Ludovico degli Arrighi about 1526.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was defining &lsquo;important&rsquo; as simply designers whose work -either individual designs, or as a body of work- I felt was relevant during the time it was created (or is now relevant today).</p>
<p>Hermann Zapf: Palatino, Optima, Zapfino&hellip; those are good reasons, I don&rsquo;t see a need to go any further.</p>
<p>Carol Twombly: because of Trajan, Charlemagne, contributions to Myriad, etc. Carol&rsquo;s name and work was one of the first I became associated with when I began with digital type (My first college text on type design was &ldquo;Stop Stealing Sheep &amp; Find Out How Type Works&rdquo;, and Carol was one of several featured within, IIRC). Also her Association Typographique Internationale award- it&rsquo;s always stuck in my mind she was the first woman to win it. I&rsquo;m not sure if she is still designing today, but her work with type certainly lives on.</p>
<p>Ray Larabie: I would bet some would be surprised to see my mention of Mr. Larabie, largely because his past work was not quite so &ldquo;original&rdquo; (considering the freeware fonts he created based from existing corporate logos). Love it or not, I think quite a bit of that became an underground movement in itself, spurred &ldquo;non-designers&rdquo; to experiment with type a little more, and indirectly drew more serious attention towards reproducing typefaces not yet digitized.</p>
<p>Since going commercial &amp; focusing on more original work, some of it&rsquo;s become quite popular- I see Neuropol X in the media quite a bit these days, and quite frankly, I think it&rsquo;s a good face for the times.</p>
<p>Does this explain the reasoning behind my choices a little better? I will admit my choices are a little more biased towards my personal taste rather than leaning towards what some may deem more historically significant. I really think this post&rsquo;s question is impossible to answer, but fun nonetheless.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just late and I&rsquo;m being curmudgeonly BUT: Bembo isn&rsquo;t a type designer by any measure. Poor Mr. Griffo always gets ignored when he invented a whole genre of typefaces. Where I come from not mentioning him is a hanging offense. And Johnston wasn&rsquo;t really a type designer&ndash;disagree all you want, he was a calligrapher who designed some signage. How on earth could you compile such a list and not mention Goudy, Dwiggins, and Cooper! And how could you make such a list and not mention any WOMEN designers?</p>
<p>Renner belongs even if he only designed Futura since it was one of the most popular and influential faces of the 20th C. and he has the distinction of having been persecuted by the Nazi&rsquo;s for having designed it in the first place. How many other type designers can say that?</p>
<p>And did anyone mention Menhart? The list isn&rsquo;t merely for western europeans is it? How many type designers have been commissioned to design a face for their country&rsquo;s constitution?</p>
<p>And where&rsquo;s Baskerville and Caslon? And if you mention Bodoni (my favorite) you must mention Didot, and not just Firmin, but all of the type designers in the bunch. And where&rsquo;s Fournier??? Vincent Figgins??? Doesn&rsquo;t inventing slab serif types mean anything?  William Caslon IV maybe? And where did all those 19th C. advertising faces come from if not for Mr. Thorne? Doesn&rsquo;t that rate? Darius Wells who invented wood type??? Shouldn&rsquo;t he be one of the top guys on the list? And I have to mention Augereau even if he isn&rsquo;t one of the top 20 since he is the only type designer executed for heresy.</p>
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s Jenson, and one could make a case for Sweynheim and Pannartz. But the most glaring omission is of course the most important type designer of all time: Johan Genzfleisch zum Gutenberg who invented it in the first place.</p>
<p>George 
I felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni</p>

<p>Hold your ideological horses here. I do not want to divert from the topic, but Paul Renner certainly did not get persecuted for having designed a typeface. Don&rsquo;t give the Nazis that much credit. Renner wrote about &ldquo;cultural bolchevism&rdquo;, which was directed at the Nazis more than at the real Bolcheviks, and he altogether didn&rsquo;t make much of a secret of his opinion about the Nazi party, especially their disdain of contemporary art and culture. That&rsquo;s why they sacked him from his teaching post. He never got &ldquo;persecuted&rdquo;. Saying that insults those who paid with their lives for having critized the Nazis.</p>

<p>Helvetica is an important font, by ubiquity alone, so Miedinger surely makes the first list. Because of that face&rsquo;s influence on other fonts and type proportions and perceptions in general, he perhaps should be on both. Larabie would be an example of someone I find &ldquo;list-level&rdquo; important for all the reasons NJPatrick is probably thinking of. His merit is not necessarily one insanely popular singular face, but his style, prolific work and influence on the masses and fledgling designers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unfortunately we have so many names and limited criteria for selection. Legacy may not be the issue. Johann Friedrich Unger, who applied the neo-classical style and engraving expertise of Firmin Didot to fraktur, is certainly an important type designer and one of the first to try to resolve the differences between German and Latin type design and typographic practice. However, black letter seems to hold little sway in the list.</p>
<p>Another important designer was Adolph Rusch who holds the historical priority for a roman type face—he was printing a roman as early as 1464. The face isn&rsquo;t very pretty, so he is an important type designer, but not a very good one when compared with those, like Griffo, who follow him.</p>
<p>William Morris/Edward Prince falls into a similar category. The Golden Type was one of the most influential of the 19th century, but doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to the Venetian revival faces that quickly followed. Morris' disciple, Edward Johnston, is certainly an important figure in the history of type design, but much more for the effect his revival of the art of the letter had on other designers than in the direct contributions he made as a designer of types.</p>
<p>The relationship of Linn Boyd Benton to his son provides an example that might guide selection. Without Linn Boyd&rsquo;s invention of the pantographic/engraving process, which Matthew Carter has called the most important invention in the history of typographic design since the 15th century, most of the type designs and type design processes that occur after c. 1880 would have much different. Benton&rsquo;s work on Century with De Vinne certainly qualifies him as a designer, but the greater breadth of his son&rsquo;s work qualifies Morris Fuller Benton as the more important designer.</p>

<p>As GGL was born in 1921, he could hardly have designed AG on his own. His involvement started in 1957, when he added a new series of weights and sizes, called – surprise! – Akzidenz Grotesk Serie 57. The light, regular and some bolder weights started appearing between the 1890s and the 1920s. All of them apocryphal designs, what Berthold called “Hausschnitt”, i.e. cut in house. Lange’s main contribution, apart from the AG development over 20 years and three technologies, was Concorde, the better Times. And his Bodoni Old Face from the late 70s was the first <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Bodoni, not a sanitized version like all the others before.</p>

<p>While i agree with that assessment of Rian’s work (and we published his first faces over 15 years ago), the list would be more than 200 names long if we only used these criteria (the FontFont library alone has 150 contributors). You do not design a classic; time, talent and economics need to come together to do that. Helvetica was a fairly mediocre cleaning-up of Scheltersche Grotesk via Haasche Grotesk, and Miedinger was a salesman, not a designer. His drawings were pretty basic, but the face hit a nerve: in 1957, postwar Europe was ready for something clean, without a past and without obvious ancestry, coming out of neutral Switzerland. The same applied to most faces that represent a period now; Garamond, Baskerville, Caslon, Bodoni, Akzidenz Grotesk, Futura, Gill, Helvetica.
Some of Roger Excoffon&rsquo;s typefaces are amazing, but they always looked too French to really be a world-wide success. AvantGarde Gothic was a sensation when it came out, but nobody would call it a good typeface. Neither would we regard most ITC designs from the 70s, but they were seminal in their influence. Zuzana Licko’s first Emigre bitmap fonts more than 20 years ago hardly qualify as type design by most standards, but they are now true classics.</p>
<p>And these days? We have more talented type-designers than ever before. They know both their history and their tools, and they make better type than any of the famous names mentioned above. But their chance to make history is minimal. I think that is great, because I do not consider us to be artists, but visual engineers who serve those people who use our typefaces: readers and designers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;I’m trying to compile a list of the 20 most important type designers of all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Germany since around two years the TV guys offer more and more &lsquo;Best of..&rsquo; shows. &lsquo;Best commercials of the last 10 years&rsquo;, &lsquo;Best 100 comedy shows of the century&rsquo; up to &lsquo;Worst celebraties of the world&rsquo; (No. 1 was Paris Hilton by the way).</p>
<p>I always try to see a font in close connection with the epoche it was designed. Otherwise you see all these old fonts with only &lsquo;modern&rsquo; eyes. What today is &lsquo;old-fashioned&rsquo; in the past was &lsquo;Moderne Fraktur&rsquo;:
<a href="http://www.bleisetzer.de/index.php?target=shop/shop_details&amp;artikel_id=355&amp;b=0004&amp;pic=a">http://www.bleisetzer.de/index.php?target=shop/shop_details&amp;artikel_id=355&amp;b=0004&amp;pic=a</a></p>
<p>And the marketing guys who created this name for the font, brought it to the point.. of 1886. Of course they did not want to design an old-fashioned font.</p>
<p>Its the same with the font artists of today. The answers they give are answers for questions of today. Do we know what a GG Lange or Paul Renner would say about one of the fonts of today? May be they&rsquo;ld say its not possible to use it (in 1936), because the market would&rsquo;nt accept it.</p>
<p>So: &lsquo;If you want to know who you are, you have to know where you&rsquo;re coming from.&rsquo; And so a best-of-list may be is a funny thing, but not realy important, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

Is that a truly innovative thing, or a mode that has existed for some time. Are you referring to the smooth merger of two similar faces, or that look where it seems like the trademarks of two faces have been smashed into a postmodern hybrid? Who&rsquo;s on the short list?

<p>The problem is that there can be no list that satisfies the criteria; the objective is futile. Top-N lists do not reach consensus and have very little value.</p>
<p>Change the criteria and the problem is ameliorated. For example, &ldquo;my top 20 favourite type designers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the 20 type designers I consider most significant&rdquo; are quite achievable lists. Do that instead.</p>

If you think of work of a life time, names like Frutiger, Zapf or Fuller Benton may appear, but if you&rsquo;re thinking about contributions that may have influenced largely in the history of typography and typeface design and innovation, then names like Jenson (first &ldquo;roman&rdquo;), Griffo(first italic), Garamond (First slanted caps), Eric Gill and Hans Meyer(humanist sans) Sumner Stone (family), Benton(again)(gothic style and family), Otl Aicher (family), Frutiger (again)(grid and family), Miedinger/Hoffmann (most popular) would make sense. Stablish the criteria first, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have preference and speculation. Some may agree with with quite a few, but the number 20 will become a problem&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Basically, I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense to think about such a list when you are considering typefaces coming out of such different eras of print, and thus out of radically different views and technologies.
Today we can talk of &ldquo;a Garamond&rdquo; or &ldquo;a Bodoni&rdquo;. There were no such things at the time of Garamond and Bodoni. And there shouldn’t be neither now. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I could conceive of a list of the 20 or 50 greatest type designers of all time.</p>
<p>After all, if one writes a book on the history of typography, one is exercising a process of selection.</p>
<p>But a list of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most important<!-- raw HTML omitted --> type designers of all time as distinct from a list of the greatest type designers of all time&hellip; that raises a new question.</p>
<p>Does it mean a list of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most influential<!-- raw HTML omitted --> type designers of all time? If so, clearly Jenson and Aldus get to be on the list, as well as Caslon. Paul Renner would make the list as well.</p>
<p>But if one actually wants to draw a distinction between most important and most influential&hellip;</p>
<p>The BAMS codebook used by British merchant ships in World War II was set in the roman designed by Alexander Phemister. Did this result in a saving of eyestrain that helped win the war, making him one of the most important type designers of all time?</p>
<p>That is a facetious example, but I think you can see what I&rsquo;m getting at. If one is defining &ldquo;importance&rdquo; in an open-ended way, to include impact on the outside world, one is venturing into very uncharted territory.</p>
