I am going to have to disagree with you. I think dafont.com is a steep and slippery slope for students. Free fonts are a prime example of "you get what you pay for" with <em>very</em> few exceptions. Not only this, I find that when designers (students especially) grow comfortable with DaFont, that they begin to devalue type overall and become more prone to find unethical methods of acquiring  the truly great typefaces. 

In my opinion, Bleeding Cowboy does not seem to define our time; it looks to me like it was designed to define a previous era.

Riccard0: <em>it seems to me that the typeface of this decade seems already overused just after a year or two.</em>
what typeface are you talking about, pray-tell?

		<div class="commentbody">Mr Evan
 in my heart I agree with you. But I do think Bleeding Cowboy transcended its visual intent by becoming a modern typeface that has nothing to do with cowboys or the West. I remember many years ago in NYC, DJ Jonathan Schwartz was about to play the definitive sound of the eighties—much to everyone's surprise, it was Jane Fonda's Workout.
Students do grow comfortable with dafont and the sad reality is, they really want to pay for little, given the high cost of tuition. Teaching typography, one can instill the notion that "you get what you pay for" but for the most part, at this point in their lives, they are happy about "borrowing" fonts, program, music, etc. The subject of this thread was a font that defined or defines our times. By defining one assumes that is not about liking it, but seeing it as some larger aspect of the culture. In that regard, Bleeding Cowboy is the Jane Fonda Workout.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My fave would have to be Proxima Nova. For the seamless blending of geometric, clasically proportioned letters and the more modern, currently preferred humanist type. I know other fonts are in this area (e.g. Avenir, Museo Sans) but I think Proxima does it best. Really flexible (loads of weights and widths) when I'm using type for image making, integration with a grid. Geometric fonts are too sterile (kind of unwordy) and have a dated look. To me it carresses the nebulous delicious threshold between looking and reading (pretentious, moi?)

Hrant, Legato is beautiful. Do you think you could elaborate on the critique you gave on typographica, as I didn't quite understand it?

You have created a time-waster for those who like to show off their impeccable good taste.

You have got me in a corner! What are the best? I guess that is different for everyone. (IMO) the best faces are the ones that have enough in them to allow a designer to set beautiful text. Type that one might predict would become a standard in years to come (in this sense, I agree with riccard0's first comment in this thread). Type faces like Univers, Scala, DIN, Minion, Meta, etc. 

My favs would have to be (in no particular order):

[[http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033|Archer from H&FJ]]
[[http://www.type-together.com/Skolar|Skolar from Type Together]]
[[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000431|Alejandro Paul's Adios]]
[[http://vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexSerif/mudTyper+Weights/|Apex Serif]]
And I am excited to get to know [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/calluna.html|Calluna]] a little better!

I am really bad at top-ten-esque lists! Maybe you're right, Nick. Maybe I am lazy :)

In this context, the questions of "best" is really of a subjective nature, not objective. I guess my original question was "what are your favs!"

Hey, hoe gaat het?

I think you got my point exactly, which was that one needn't necessarily have reacted to the word "best" so literally and strictly, but maybe listed fonts that answered any of your suggested questions.

Anyway, I probably sounded negative, but I thought it was an interesting contrast. I value the (over)intellectualization here.

@Nick
I certainly see your point, but it requires the contextualization of every font (or font choice, if you will). On the other hand, there are fonts there are just well crafted, widely used, and beautiful (ahem... Gotham... ahem). Who would say Gotham was THE best choice every time is has been used? Yet, there it is, a great font being used over and over and over. I'd say it's one of the best of the decade. ;)</div>

I have not! Have you?

@begsini

Great points there! I think there is an objective method for defining what are the best typefaces. While objectivity wasn't the point of this thread (I probably should've titled it "Favorite typefaces of the decade"), I think it raises an interesting question! HOWEVER! To pull the rug out from under your logic, arial is widely used beyond the scope of the personal computer (in signage, print, and even [[http://www.artofthetitle.com/2009/11/30/how-we-built-britain/|this almost-awesome title sequence]]). I don't think we'd find a pair of typophiles who think Arial is a great typeface.

Good points all around tho!

Owen, the explanation of why Legato is so special is admittedly esoteric, and difficult to do in the short space I had for the Typographica thing. I can't use up too much space/time here either... Basically though it breaks our dependency on the tools used (if only metaphorically) to make 99.9% of type; these tools are handwriting, and the grid.

Top ten? There is a useful purity in a singularity.

That's more like it Evan.

But I wonder if the types people have said are their favorites really are the faces they favor for their own work.
Sure, there are faces one has often seen well used, and admired, but they would be favorites as a reader or connoisseur.
What are the new faces that people who are graphic designers, art directors and typographers have actually used the most--i.e. what are your "go to" faces?

The only art direction I've done most of the decade involves promoting my own faces, so I don't really have a favorite in that sense, but it could be that Scotch Modern is my favorite, as I've been using it as my browser default face since 2005.

There are lots of faces I've admired for one reason or another, but I wouldn't say they were favorites or best.
Recently, I've liked Memoriam and Klimax. I was living in the UK when the Guardian was redesigned in 2005, and that was probably the typographic highlight of the decade for me (that didn't involve my own work)--of course the types involved were wonderful, but they were only part of the picture. 

If there is one face I could perhaps credit as Best, and most inspirational, it would be from the perspective of someone who has designed multi-script, feature rich OpenType faces, and it's there that I would single out Robert Slimbach's work in Arno. I mean, polytonic italic small caps? Five optical sizes? Cyrillic and Greek Swash caps? That's setting the bar pretty high!

<em>...to change the future, for the better.</em>

That's a good criterion Hrant, and your choice accords. But if Legato is so important, how come even its leading type-designer advocate hasn't got around to designing a face along its principles? Put up or shut up! </div>

«Do as I say, not as I do.»

I don't think shutting up is entirely beneficial; if I can make others realize the importance of something, I'm doing society a service. But I am actually working towards that, if only at a snail's pace. Another quote:
«Watching me work is like watching a refrigerator make ice.»

Sadly, my ice doesn't match Carter's however!  :-/

Yes, I know that over here FF Balance was early on pointed at as some kind of “rip off” from Antique Olive — but I know a lot of French type designers who talk too much. 
Instead we should be grateful to Bloemsma for having taken Excoffon’s tricks one or two or fifty steps further — thus giving him a well-earned credibility on the international stage, where French type design was notoriously (and for pretty good reasons) invisible for several decades.</div>

I’m only a teacher and writer, Nick — and I don’t even own FF Legato, though I've been drooling over it for quite some time. Full disclosure : I intended to have it as a Christmas gift this year, but my girlfriend found the idea really too “nerdish”, so I will probably have the Emigre book instead.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I've used Legato in two finished pieces – a small book, for text (although I set it badly), and in a poster and matching program flyer for a conference, for titling. I'm currently working with it in a small identity project, and a book (plus cover) where I use it for titling (combined with Patria for text).
FWIW, that's why I said I find it funny that people like it even if they don't «get» it – it's what I've had happen with clients, they take to it. Avance seems much harder to «sell» at least in my experience – more people think it's weird.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Certainly, designers have been nudging (or just playing around with) counters independently of the "outsides" since way back. But mostly as a form of compensation, without an explicit "plan", from what I've discerned.

I actually used AdLib as an example of that in my recent Mexico City talk. And of course I mentioned Dwiggins (who harbored a great paradox in terms of chirography).

Oof! It's one thing to call us frugal, but a whole other to call us cheap!

We simply don't have the money. My family—bless their hearts!—is already busting their behinds for my tuition and food. My mother very generously funds/assists funding for other pursuits—such as the Adobe Suite.

But for something like type? There's simply no money to be had. Students don't have money for complimentary supplements. We buy our cameras without the lenses, our paints without the varnishes, and our InDesign without the Gotham. 

Personally? I don't see a problem. If anything, I think it's a positive message to students to say that they have "enough" with simply the default set. 

(Interestingly enough, this board took very poorly to me when I suggested otherwise once before, so I'd be interested to see if that comment will be received differently this time.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">James,

I am with you. As a student I probably spend way too much on type (it's a bit of an addiction, really). However! For my fellow students who do not purchase typefaces, we have the luxury of using computers in the graphic design computer lab. Complete with a wide array of fantastic typefaces (from a complete set of Univers and Akzidenz Gortesque to newer fonts like Skala, Din, Meta, and tons of other typefaces).

As for your comment "<em>I think it’s a positive message to students to say that they have “enough” with simply the default set</em>" ... I agree 100%. Using poorly crafted fonts from DaFont can really be a scape goat for good design. Limitations are important, the hone your skills as a designer! By limiting oneself to the typefaces that come with one's computer and the Adobe Suite, one is able to really grow as a designer. Much more so that students who over fill their font libraries with the sludge that comes from free font sites*.

*NOTE: that not all free fonts are "sludge." There are some good free typefaces and with a trained eye and a sensitivity, one can find these rare gems! Places like www.exljbris.nl and fontsquirrel are good places to start.

They aren't just beautiful typefaces. Jos is one of the people who have been actively redefining how typefaces are developed and distributed. By offering some of the weights for free he's giving people a chance to truly test drive a font family. Very awesome idea Jos!</div>

Of course that doesn't mean I always stick to my favorites, and don't check if maybe something else wouldn't be more appropriate; I'm a designer, not a missionary.

I don't spend enough on type! But if I were to buy a set, it'd be Gotham, and that's simply not an easy first buy... 

One's possibilities with the simple basic set are endless. Though, if I may, Zapfino is hardly a satisfactory script font, in my opinion. Is Snell or Shelly default? Sheesh, I forget these days.
