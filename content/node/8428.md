  target="_blank"> Abaddon</a> is a version of an earlier typeface which he used to
  set on typositor. Does anyone know what this was called back then?

  body: I think the poster may be mistaken about that. Scriptorium&#39;s &#39;Abaddon&#39;
    is based on a display typeface  created by Alex Jay for the interior titles for
    the book &#34;The Dinosaurs&#34; by William Stout, published in 1981 by Bantam
    Books. The book notes say the typeface was &#39;inspired in part by letterforms
    in Alphonse Mucha&#39;s classic 1901 Art Nouveau portfolio, <i>Documents Decoratifs</i>&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>It does not give a name to the typeface. Dave Nalle does not usually
    credit the Scriptorium font sources.

  body: Thanks very much for that info, Mike. I&#39;ll point the <BR>Myfonts poster
    to this thread. <BR> <BR>Many of Mr. Nalle&#39;s early fonts were digitizations
    <BR>of typefaces that can be found in the Solotype <BR>Catalog and elsewhere.
    It always bugged me <BR>that he gave new names to those and never <BR>credited
    the originals. <BR> <BR>Have a great 2005. <BR><br>

  body: Thank you for letting us know that. I&#39;m sure I used a typositor font made
    by VGC or Castcraft in the 1980s for a designer named Carol Russo. She did science
    fiction covers for Tor Books, Baen Books, Bantam Books and a few other publishing
    houses.

  body: When you say Castcraft might have been the source of your Typositor font,
    that makes anything possible. Castcraft/Opti never designed any fonts that I have
    seen -- they are all copies of other designs. I am confident that the information
    I gave about the typeface is its true origin. What happened to it after that is
    something only those other players can answer.  <BR> <BR>The reason I knew that
    is that I bought that book when it was new, and had always been interested in
    that typeface. The small notes and publication data contained the information
    I quoted. When I saw Scriptorium&#39;s Abbadon, I knew at once what Dave Nalle
    had used as his model. &#40;Or at least, what it was based on. Maybe he had access
    to the same Typositor font that you remember using.&#41; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a pretty
    dramatic and distinctive typeface, so I am not doubting you would remember it
    if you used it. My initial statement was just based on the idea that I knew the
    source, but I don&#39;t know how Typositor fonts were supplied. I have never seen
    another digital version of the Jay typeface, except the Scriptorium font.
