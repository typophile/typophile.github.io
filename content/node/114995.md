  realise some of this is somewhat blurry or subjective and generalised!\r\nAny thoughts

  body: "<blockquote><strong>As part of my studies</strong> I'm writing an article
    on personal charatersitics/personality traits which are common with typographers
    and good leaders<cite> (emphasis added)</cite></blockquote>\r\n\r\nHmm. Can't
    think of any typographers who were also leaders, at least, if you count only corporation
    of over 50 employees or civil groupings larger than villages.\r\n\r\nWouldn't
    it follow that any shared personality traits would be accidental? As you might
    find with any arbitrary paring, such as typographers and serial killers?\r\n\r\nBTW,
    if you check Wikipedia on 'type designers,' you'll find that in recent usage,
    'type designers' prefer to be compared architects rather than to typographers.
    I can't imagine why, since the largest and most common  architectural works these
    days are strip malls (retail parks in the U.K.)... Perhaps apt, though, with the
    ending of the sign-painter era... http://typophile.com/node/114821\r\n\r\nOdd
    assignment..."

  body: When you're writing something "inspirational" for "leaders", falsifiable observations
    of reality (such as an ad hoc psychological profile of typography professionals)
    are only going to get in the way. A purely metaphorical premise is safer. Write
    about what they can learn from <em>typefaces.</em> "The spaces between things
    are as important as the things themselves," that kind of stuff. You could probably
    even derive something genuinely meaningful about clarity of communication.
