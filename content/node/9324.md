  body: Thanks Franz <BR>I looked at that one, but &#40;as with the other Caslon&#39;s
    I&#39;ve looked at&#41; it has no serif on the lower end of the &#39;C&#39;. <BR>
    <BR>Any others?

    SB.

  body: Franz, yes, you&#39;re right about the C - I think I must have been looking
    at Adobe Caslon. <BR> <BR>There are quite a few differences &#40;and an overall
    different impression&#41; to the Baskervilles I have handy. &#40;sorry!&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Caslon 540?  Could be...
