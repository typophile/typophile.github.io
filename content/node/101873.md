  door in a cooking store. I can hardly wait to get my hands dirty, but I was wondering
  if any of you have any experience doing such a job.\r\n\r\nI already found some
  useful tips-n-tricks on various blogs.\r\nThis door is freshly painted, so first
  thing I'll do is totally cover it in chalk and then clean it - this to avoid any
  scratching.\r\nFurthermore, I'll keep the door wet whilst drawing, wetting the chalk
  too.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I've already seen Dana Tanamachi's vimeo's. Great stuff!\r\n\r\nMore
  tips-n-tricks are highly appreciated!"

    recently, but worked dry.\r\nI found that spritizing with a detergent solution
    spray then wiping with a damp synthetic cloth was a better way to clean than dry
    wiping, or wet wiping without detergent, which left streaks.\r\n"

  body: "True, it's lettering, not typographic, I stand corrected.\r\nI'll get some
    detergent. Also one tip was to not use paper to wipe because is leaves residue,
    cloth is better.\r\nThe design will be made in advance off course. \r\nProjection
    seems a good way of enlarging the design, but since I don't have a overhead projector,
    a grid will have to do (besides, will projection work on a black surface?). \r\n\r\nThanks
    so far!"

    idea on paper).\r\n\r\nhttp://yourjustlucky.com/#/people-matter/"

    you could borrow one from your local library or a church or other organization
    that has one. \r\n\r\nThere are also multimedia projectors that can be connected
    to a laptop computer (that's how PowerPoints are projected). They usually cost
    several hundred dollars but again maybe you can borrow one. There are also devices
    called sketch projectors or tracing projectors that artists use sometimes. You
    can find those in the ballpark of $50 at Amazon, but I've never tried one.\r\n\r\n>
    will projection work on a black surface?\r\n\r\nIt should work if the drawing
    is white lines on a black background, and the room isn't overly bright."

  body: "Use a fairly hard pencil to draw a lineature, with the aid of a ruler that
    is long enough to cover the width. I guess doing this with two or three persons
    would be easier.\r\n\r\nDefine x-height for a start, maybe also cap-height.\r\n\r\nThe
    pencil lines are fairly invisible, but will remain when the chalk text is removed,
    in case correction or new text is needed.\r\n\r\n(Edit: sorry, just noted this
    is a fairly old thread.)"

  body: "Thanks Bert.\r\nI find that using a grid wasn't really neccessary. Mind you,
    I did draw it with chalk, which made the grid very wobbly. Not a good idea on
    my part.\r\n\r\nThought I'd use lowtack tape for straight lines in stead of pencil,
    that won't be visible after removal. And I'll be shopping for chalk in pencil
    form if there is such a thing :)"

    years ago one could have it for $10 new.  Unfortunately, I made presents of all
    the copies I had, and now when I need it, it is about $30\u2026\r\n\r\nThe book
    consists of 3 interleaved topics: <ul>\r\n<li>how to design 2D visualizations
    of complicated 3D structures, <li>tips on putting the visualizations on paper/blackboard,
    <li>math one can deduce from the example visualizations in the book.</ul>\r\nThe
    mathematical part is, I suppose, mostly a little bit dense for a non-enthusiast.
    \ However, I suspect that the other two parts may be of much more general interest."
