body: I need help with something. You see when I design a letter my biggest problem
  is creating the serifs. So I started this thread in hopes of obtaining info from
  fellow typophiles on serifs that set themselves apart from the usual triangle formation.
  I would really appreciate the feedback.  <BR> <BR>IM

  body: Instead of worrying about making serifs interesting/different, I would instead
    try to make serifs that are <i>appropriate</i> to the atmosphere you&#39;re trying
    to create with the design. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Try tracing a few letters from excellent fonts. You&#39;ll learn how the
    masters constructed their serifs. If you don&#39;t have it, Jan Tschichold&#39;s
    &#34;Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering&#34; is a good place to start. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    currently tracing Centaur caps, which have truly magnificent serifs. For a more
    typographic, less calligraphic approach, try the Le Be alphabet in the Tschichold
    book &#40;or in Harry Carter&#39;s &#34;View of Early Typography&#34;, which is
    more scholarly&#41;. Dozens of fonts with beautiful and distinctive serifs come
    to mind: Palatino, Bembo, Bodoni, Perpetua, Trajan, Columna, Goudy, Friz Quadrata,
    Albertus, Egyptian, Novarese, etc., etc., etc.'

  body: Hrant, you do have a point, but what I&#39;m trying to do is diversify what
    is appropiate rather than follow a set formula. <BR>    ex. what if one side of
    a serif was longer than the other. or what if one went straight in to the stem
    while the otherside curved into the stem softly. <BR> <BR>raph, thanks so much
    for the idea of tracing some classic lettering. It was an idea I had in mind but
    I was afraid if I based my ideas on other fonts my designs would lack originality,
    I know now that this is not true. also thank you for the font examples I&#39;ll
    write it down. anymore suggestions? <BR> <BR>IM
