    make an \"O\". As close as I can get for General Music is: MKaputt-Expanded from
    Dafont\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=MKaputt-Expanded+"

  body: "Photolettering era, when fonts were expanded, contracted etc. with ease.\r\nTake
    a look at Filmotype Manchester http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/manchester/
    expand the width and see the similarities, except for the different leg on R.
    Dig and there might be an exact match from a photo-lettering outfit, which was
    photo-stretched for the music label. \r\nDon"

  body: "Good find Dick. Looks like Mickey Rossi has provided the stretched font.
    I note that he puts it in his \"recreations\" category.  I wonder what he used
    as a source. Presumably one of the photolettering outfits? BTW, _Flytrap Wide_
    looks like a lighter weight of _Not a Number_.\r\nThe majority of his sources
    are familiar, eg _Level Fourteen Druid_ is the circa 1900 _Primitive_, _Barbender
    Bold_ is _Pump_, and _Flanders Ride_ is _Salut_ with a bonus italic. But some
    others, including the two stretched sans, are not obvious.\r\nInteresting collection.\r\nDon"

  body: Good find Dick - would love to know the source for the " recreation", wonder
    if Manfred Klein used the same one for his version that i found - his is more
    grunge.
