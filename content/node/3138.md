  <BR>Long story short, we&#39;re taking our nameplate back to the original it was
  in 1897, i digitized it and here&#39;s a comparison. <BR><!--attachment: Comparison-26544.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*117.2**Comparison%2ePDF

  <BR>I hafta get the final version on our paper to go out on Monday, in the meantime
  i&#39;d appreciate any criticism, written, visual or otherwise. I know i&#39;m having
  issues with my spacing that I&#39;m not quite sure how to resolve, if you see anything
  else, lemme know, BTW i like the lc w, so don&#39;t knock it! '

  body: The only thing that looks off to me is the ear on the top of the lowercase
    &#34;w&#34;. :-&#41; <BR>From the original, it looks like the ear hits the vertical
    at an angle instead of curved like how you have it.  <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t tell
    from the original if it&#39;s like this, but you may want to round the ends of
    all of the skinny strokes.

    <BR>besides making those changes, i tamed the top of the verticals on the lc h
    and the 2 lc l&#39;s. <BR>matt, do you think the skinny strokes need rounding
    at the end? i probably won&#39;t have time to do that for this week, but i may
    do that in the future. <BR>Any other feedback? is the revival too bland? too strict?
    too dated? too anything? would love to hear back from you on this, soon if possible.
    thnx again for your help.'

  body: Looking good. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s completely necessary to round the
    ends of the strokes. <BR> <BR>The only thing that slightly bugs me is that there
    are some inconsistencies in the skinny stroke weights and the skinny strokes in
    general are a little bit too heavy.  <BR> <BR>Those aren&#39;t huge issues, but
    may be something to fix when you have time.

  body: Paul mechanicaly its sound but optically I would tighten up the il combination
    in Mail, just a drop it would improve the overall color. The two verticles next
    to one another tend to float.
