    can deal a significant blow to the industry that underground piracy never can.
    They turn an uneducated public into unwitting pirates. The notion it breeds: \"If

    why should I ever pay for a font?\""

    containing fonts for download illegally. The best thing you can do when you find
    such sites is to e-mail the people whom you know which work at the foundries.
    Or, you can e-mail me as I'm in touch with some of the larger foundries in regards
    to this issue. Please edit your posts and remove the URLs. Thank you.

    guilt, er, I mean by educating them.\r\n\r\nI see your point Tiff, and agree that
    we don't want to steer anyone down the wrong path (the path of evil! \xABInsert
    echo here\xBB). However, I believe that there is a benefit to having the URLs
    posted, at least within discussions such as this (vs a collection of sorts that
    could potentially act as a resource for free font hunters), as a means of creating
    awareness \u2013 awareness within the type design community and also the general
    design community, those utilizing the fonts. It is so easy to take advantage of
    Google for these types of searches and it is probably the first step taken anyway,
    so I don't see any harm in the link being here.\r\n\r\n"

    from out of everyone's path. Which is, of course, in itself a completely unrealistic
    thing to do. If you are tempted by something and want it badly enough you won't
    stop looking until the so-called itch has been scratched. So to speak.\r\n\r\nAs
    I posted previously I did have second thoughts. But, obviously I didn't pause
    long enough. It comes down to trust. If we had a wiki full of \"evil sites not
    to visit\" would it become a bad thing? Or would it be educational. There isn't
    a black or white. I know that it would be used for evil and good. Gray is my color
    today.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I wasn't the moderator in this instance. I did ask
    for Mike to remove the URL and didn't intend to remove it. Well, not today anyway.
    But, I would have done it eventually. \r\n\r\nHow can we approach this? Putting
    it in the uppercase would be like preaching to the converted. Should there be
    a wiki? A wiki specific to sites that are wide-spread already but that need to
    be pointed out as bad? \r\n\r\nI am in agreeance. Sorry, my moderator hat was
    on a little too tight. Let's do something about this."
