  Black]] as a headline with [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson_studio/proxima_nova_condensed_thin_set_ot/|Proxima
  Nova Condensed]] as a subhead...it's for a university student newspaper I'm redesigning.
  I wonder, are there any other alternatives to Proxima Nova Condensed that I could
  test out? I really love the contrast between the two but I am not 100%  sold on
  Proxima Nova.  \r\n\r\nAppreciate the help!\r\nVikki"

    (scroll down to condensed styles), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-nobel/?refby=i|Nobel
    Condensed]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/erbar/?refby=i|Erbar Condensed]]
    (only bold styles available), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/?refby=i|Interstate]]
    or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-g-type/morpeth/?refby=i|Morpeth]] for example."

  body: "Kupfers - thanks -  great suggestions, I totally forgot about Interstate,
    but sadly, no italics are available. And yes, I'm going for a Thin or Book cut
    for maximum contrast to Utopia. hope it's not too jarring.....?\r\n\r\nApologies,
    I'm too dumb to make this show up as an image: http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/6457/screenshot20110714at146.png "

    Telefon has a light cut in the works and a lot of similarities in structure. There's
    no condensed style though. Other geometric sans serifs with condensed styles:
    Graphik, Gotham and VF Sans.\r\n\r\n"

    might also be too light (like in your image). What printing process?"
