  body: Definitely hand lettered, some of these letters would belong to different
    typefaces if it were done today. Also, it depends if you're wanting to match the
    underlying shape, or the round corners... You might look at Ultramagnetic, Garage
    Gothic... The "P" and "R" looks similar to Refrigerator Deluxe... (this is all
    off the top of my head, don't have time to check...)
