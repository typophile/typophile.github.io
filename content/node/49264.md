  contemporary [[Georgian]] (=Mkhedruli) font.\r\nAre there any professional (maybe
  even screen optimized) font famlies out there, that offer different thicknesses
  or \"caps\"? Alternatively, is there any family or cut of a solid \"western\" font
  (like Helvetica, Meta, Frutiger...) that includes letters of this exotic alphabet?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\nThomas\r\n\r\n"

    We all Georgian mac users deleting two fonts: Arial Uni and this new one Menlo
    because almost 10 years we using our own very nice and very beautiful fonts from
    Mr. Reno Siradze. He is a professional and working on macs almost 25 year.\r\n\r\nWe
    are almost 100 mac users and have our georgian mac community and if you all believe
    me, we are using fonts from Reno Siradze and many years asking apple to builtin
    georgian fonts in the Mac OS X but nobody cares or even listens.\r\n\r\nPlease
    people if you have any power or ways to contact apple, ask them favour from georgian
    mac users to change fonts. The best fonts with georgian keybord drive are there:

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nit turned out that after some research we still didn't find
    any font that was working for us at all. So, loosely based on Eurostyle, and on
    our requirements \u2013 it had to be bold, striking and compatible with a western
    font \u2013 we comissioned a custom-built typeface for the client, including three
    weights and Italics.\r\nIt was primarily used in news graphics, channel programming
    and on-air menus, but soon found it's way to the website, you can see some examples
    here: http://www.1tv.ge\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the font is used exclusively in-house
    and not out there, as far as I know.\r\nWe hired a native speaker/reader and tried
    our best to judge the effort, but if there are any mother-tongue readers out there,
    it would be interesting to hear their opinion about it!\r\n\r\nKeeping my fingers
    crossed for more good fonts in that alphabet,\r\nThomas\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eurostyle_GEO_6330.jpg]"

    been to tell what the problems are. And why do you recommend searching for a \"developer\"
    if these are \"problems in this design\"?\r\nYou make me curious, especially since

    made two Georgian fonts (one a \"progressive\" display face*, the other a run-of-the-mill
    text face), and as a non-native I appreciate what sorts of issues can go ignored
    (I was lucky to have the help of a semi-native professor at UCLA, as well as a
    native reader) and I see some of that here.\r\n2) A native reader helps a lot
    when you're lacking a native type designer, but it's not enough by itself.\r\n3)
    Most of all: it's too late. Any feedback at this point is largely academic. Certainly
    not a total waste, and it's nice to see a post-factum request for feedback, but
    I'd rather spend my own (inadequately managed) energies on things that can make
    a difference to a lot of people.\r\n\r\n* http://themicrofoundry.com/f_akhalkalak.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    allows it, I naturally prefer a discussion during the progress. Since my team
    initially didn't plan to create a custom font, we didn't have the time to develop
    the font with the help of expert eyes and the broader discussion as we have it
    here.\r\nGiven the enormously short development time, I'm really happy with the
    results, as is the client. But I'm sure that the font is imperfect. Meticulous
    analysis would be disproportionate - it's too late after all. However, if some
    native reader or native designer stumbles upon this discussion thread, I'd still
    be very interested to hear which impression it left on them.\r\n\r\nThrough a
    partnering company in Russia, we got in contact with Merab K. Getsadze who is
    the type designer. He is as far as I know Georgian or of Georgian descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Thomas seems to be a discriminating person, so if he's ever in a similar position,
    hopefully he can feel more confident that we can help, and more than just by providing
    a casual, academic critique. Even though I think he's ahead of the game (simply
    because he cares), everybody can benefit from help. \r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
