  font face as close to Adobe Caslon Pro as possible. The template I am using only
  allows the use of Google Web Fonts. \r\n\r\nSo, does anyone have any thoughts on
  the most similar Google Webfont to Adobe Caslon Pro?\r\n\r\nRealize I could use
  typekit to do this, but thats not what this theme comes with. Also maybe Georgia
  or Times but wanted to something a little more unique? \r\n\r\nAnyone have any thoughts.
  Greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nI\r\n\r\n "
