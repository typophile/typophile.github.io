body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/becksbeer_3414.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know what font Beck's uses at the top of their BecksBeer.com webpage? It says Different
  By Choice, and the fonts I was given for my project don't match what they're using
  on their website. I can probably get this information tomorrow directly from them,
  but I lose a day (somewhat).\r\n\r\nThanks!"
