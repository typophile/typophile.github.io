  had a very dark psychedelic (Seventies) mood. \r\n\r\nNow for a project of my own
  I'd like to emulate that feel. Can you help identify the logo font on <a href=http://www.heymikey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/man,_myth,_magic_1.jpg>this</a>
  hardcover? It was part of a series of paranormal encyclopedias published in 1970
  called Man Myth and Magic. \r\n\r\n<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_Myth_%26_Magic_(encyclopedia)>Here</a>
  is the wikipedia entry.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
