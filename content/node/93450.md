  anyone know which fonts are being used in the Paula Scher \"make it bigger\" book\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.be/books?id=IbT2TDjVK_YC&printsec=frontcover&hl=nl&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\r\n\r\nI'm
  thinking this could be suited for a project I'm starting on, if maybe there are
  similar looking fonts that might be just as interesting I'm always open for suggestions\r\n\r\nthanks
  for helping, its much appreciated"
