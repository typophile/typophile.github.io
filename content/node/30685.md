    I think they\u2019re <em>closer</em> than Sacker\u2019s Antique. I\u2019ll keep
    an eye out nonetheless."

  body: I think this is some version/digitisation of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=9&displayfontid=LH.108142.0.0&fontRendererText=03">Walbaum</a>.
    [[Nick Shinn]] digitised it as <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=2&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=walburn&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=03">Walburn</a>.
    [[Storm Type Foundry]] has a <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-52-walbaum-text">text

  body: "If you're happy, then I should be too, but I was under the impression that
    the '3' had a round serif at the end of the lower stroke. That's why I picked
    the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.2780.10.19&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=03&sampleSize=60\">Solid
    Antique Roman</a>. So did both of Conor's choices, but I don't see that on the
    Walbaum/Walburn numerals. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: You're right about that detail, Mike, I noticed that as well. I went for general
    feel of the stroke modulation and character structure. Well, as long as the customer's
    happy... ;^)
