  first is initially regency golf club. Its not really a big deal to be identified
  as much as the bottom, I can easily get away using Lucidia sans (with modifying
  the g) for this. \r\n\r\nWhat i am really needing a font for the St. Lucia West
  Indias... again any help would be appreciated. \r\n"
