  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">First, let me say I am aware of <a href=http://typophile.com/node/19778>this thread</a> and those linked from it. I do think I understand the concepts behind [[GPOS]] and [[ccmp]].

Now, my problem is the following: I am trying to tweak <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_UCS_Outline_Fonts>a font</a> into displaying certain diacritica combinations (such as k+ ̑ /006b,0311/ and a+ ̄+ ́ /0060,0304,0301/ and others) <i>and</i> I want to use it with a real-life word processor, either OpenOffice (NeoOffice) or Word (2003, for OS X).

My present solution is to create the glyphs I need and define them as "liga" of the characters involved. I know this is a "hack", not the purpose of "liga", since my glyphs are not ligatures in the narrow sense of the word (although I would argue that the boundary between ligatures and characters with diacritica is somewhat fluid).

This solution works for NeoOffice (but not for Word). Since this means I do have a working solution, I am now looking for a solution that is <i>not</i> a hack but still does actually work with my word processor (I won't be able to settle for a 'solution' that is theoretically correct but simply doesn't work, blame the developers)

What options do I have? I tried GPOS, and that doesn't seem to work with <i>any</i> of my applications. I think I tried ccmp, and that didn't work either. I tried fiddling with kerning and separate glyphs like "uni0311.Super" to be used in certain combinations, and I didn't get that to work.

So what makes me think I missed something? There is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doulos_SIL>Doulos SIL</a> which likewise defines certain diacritica combinations as precomposed glyphs, such as "uni00700304" (pmacron). This one does show up correctly for the p+ ̄ combination in NeoOffice (but not in Word). When I open the Doulos font in FontForge, I see that this glyph isn't listed as a ligature or anything else, it just sits there with its canonical name. I have no idea why NeoOffice displays this properly, it appears to be some functionality missing in FontForge, since when I generate it anew from FontForge, these glyphs cease to work.

I have given this a lot of thought, and I am still stuck with my "liga" hack. I would be very grateful for advice how I could build a 'correct' font that still works with OpenOffice/NeoOffice, and especially for clarification of the 'Doulos enigma' just described.

 Dieter Bachmann

1. I have never heard of Word 2003 for Mac OS X. 

2. No version of Word for Mac OS X supports any kind of OpenType Layout processing. In general, the Word for Mac support for Unicode is rather poor. 

3. Word 2003 for Windows supports "ccmp" (but not "liga"). 

4. You could assing the same lookups to both "liga" and "ccmp" if you want to maximize the "success rate" of your font.

I think "rlig" is not supported in InDesign except the Middle East version. This is why I'd suggest associating the substitution lookup with both "ccmp" (where they semantically belong) and "liga" (where they *may* be put although their place in "ccmp" is better). 

"ccmp" would work in Apple WordPad, Apple Keynote, Apple Pages and other Mac OS X 10.4 Cocoa applications, in Word 2003/2007 for Windows, and in Adobe CS2 Middle East applications, while "liga" would work in the regular Adobe CS2 applications and other apps that support "liga" but not "ccmp" (e.g. QuarkXPress 7).

		<div class="commentbody">What Adam said. Use 'liga' if you must to get functionality in current apps, but also use the "right thing" (namely 'ccmp').
