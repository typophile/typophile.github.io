body: Is there a way to modify interpolated nudge so that it works on the currently
  viewed master? Currently, I have to use Rearrange Master to make the weight I want
  to work on wt0 so that Interpolate Master works properly. Just switching to "Next
  Master" would be much faster and efficient.

    Maybe you can email him and ask him if he can send it to you. \r\n\r\nP"

  body: 'Sorry for being so late. I have provided a updated version of the Nudge Tool
    in the [[http://forum.fontlab.com/downloads.html;sa=view;down=5|download section
    at the FontLab Forum]]. This version is MM aware and works always on the active
    master. It comes in two pieces: one tool script and a modified version of the
    InterpolateNode module. Other tools which depend on the InterpolateNode module
    will also benefit from the update, if you redirect the import statements to this
    new version (as far as I have tested).'

  body: "I came across the same problem. Be able to edit without rearrange the masters
    it's really nice.  \r\nThere is a way to assign keyboard shortcuts for the Nudge
    MM to move the nodes in 10 or 100 units at time, like in the original version?"
