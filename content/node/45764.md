  body: "VILLE could be Andale Mono, or Verdana to name two possibilities you might
    have. \r\n\r\nThe script doesn't look like anything I could find in my Script
    Font ID Guide, but Bean Sprout DNA (below) was one of the most similar I could
    find (Bromont might be hand-lettered).\r\n\r\n\"branch\xE9e\" looks like de Groot's
