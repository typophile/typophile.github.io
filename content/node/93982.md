  some advices and opinions.\r\n\r\nThe project tells the story of the course of human
  history from the prehistoric to the modern age.\r\nIt's a collection of visual facts
  divided in 4 era:\r\n\r\n1- Prehistory\r\n2- Civilization\r\n3- Middle Ages\r\n4-
  Modern Age\r\n\r\nI am designing a visual identity for each section, so that design
  will evoke some sort of evolution. \r\nIs there a typeface - or a lettering style
  that you would use for each era?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or tips are very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you\r\n"

    of stuff to mind. Dunno why... *tries to look innocent and saint-like*

  body: "Prehistory is kind of a tough nut. By definition, anything prehistoric predates
    written records, and so predates any identifiable script. Ignoring this minor
    detail, one might choose something on the cusp, like cuneiforms, but that choice
    is historically incorrect and at least a tad intellectually dishonest. So, if
    you <em>really</em> want to be prehistoric, you might devise rebuses based on
    cave paintings: <em>that</em> would be stylistically and factually accurate.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    FWIW: the Modern Age is dead. We're all Postmodern now, hurling headlong into
    the Future\u2026"

    since 3 is mediaeval, is 4 'modern' the end of the middle ages and renaissance
    onwards?"

  body: "Thanks everybody for your contributions, much appreciated. \r\n\r\nSko -
    yes, it's just for main titles. For body copy I will use the same font across
    the 4 sections. \r\nSection 4, \"Modern Age\", describes the historical timeline
    after the Middle Ages, including also the contemporary history and historic events
    that are immediately relevant to the present time.\r\n\r\nI am still exploring
    but so far I am trying to adopt a different style per each section:\r\n\r\n1-
    Prehistory:  Handwriting \r\n2- Civilization: Calligraphy\r\n3- Middle Ages: Serif\r\n4-
    Modern Age: San Serif\r\n\r\n/or\r\n\r\n1- Prehistory:  Script \r\n2- Civilization:
    Slab serif (or Egyptian)\r\n3- Middle Ages: Blackletter (Based on Gothic type
    and late mediaeval calligraphy)\r\n4- Modern Age: Serif\r\n\r\nany opinions?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If Modern is post Middle ages, I would personally choose a serif (something
    like a Caslon perhaps, which is bang in the middle of the eras the section represents).\r\n\r\nEgyptians
    are rather 1800s rather than the ancients. What do you mean by Calligraphy? If
    it's something like a Chancery script I wouldn't put it with ancients either.
    Trajan says 'Ancient Rome' though if there are any suitable roman rustic style
    lettering might be more interesting?"

    we normally identify as the initial forays into writing\u2014cuneiforms and hieroglyphics\u2014were
    rigidly formal and, initially, also limited in their use to an educated elite
    class, whether administrative or executive. Scripts tend to reflect a democratization

  body: Cave paintings are the earliest artwork that has survived, but probably long
    before cave paintings were simple  symbols made with a finger or stick in the
    dirt to mark a spot, indicate direction of travel, etc.
