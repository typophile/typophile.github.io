body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find (preferably online) good graphic designer
  interviews where they speak about the importance of typeface in their work. Of course
  that everyone would say that, but I'm looking specific examples how they solve problems
  in projects. A good example would be an interview with Mark Porter and the work
  done years ago in \"The Guardian\"...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca\r\n\r\n"
