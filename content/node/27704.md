  design for which I would like to get your honest critique!\r\n\r\nI started the
  font under construction via pencil / marker sketches of some of the important small
  faces, following the general guidelines in the book 'Designing Type' (which I think
  is an absulote must for every beginner). \r\n\r\nI want the font to be applicable
  as a book type with good readability but 'with some tension and movement' here and
  there. I started with the 'a' and instead of having a rounded hook, I settled for
  a 'curve under tension' (i.e. a high curvature at the upper right shoulder. This
  was then used as the underlying theme in other faces as well (very noticeable in
  the 'e', 'c' etc. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate some feedback so that I can roll in
  some changes during further development.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!,\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This looks quite readable already in text-sizes, so the overall proportions
    seem to be right. But actually this can only be assessed if all characters are
    present, at the moment the more difficult ones are missing yet.\r\n\r\na: too
    narrow in textsetting I think, wonky lower left part, and it falls to the right.
    I like the upper part, but maybe it's just a bit too much tension.\r\nd: the bowl
    is somewhat \"undefined\" yet. give it more tension (upper right part of the bowl
    is too near to the stem, lower part of the bowl is malformed)\r\nh: is it wider
    than \"n\"? It appears to me, but I'm not sure.\r\nr: the right flag seems to
    be slightly too thin. Don't make it bigger, just thicker.\r\n\r\nPlease take these
    tips with a grain of salt and please don't rely on them solely, because I am not
    the Master of Typedesign, but I can only tell what I see, and give some of my
    experience with my own drafts.\r\n\r\nAbout \"Designing Type\": I own the book
    as well, and after several months in the bookshelf, I have found how it can be
    used: I draw my characters without the aid of the book, but when revising them
    I have a look at the book, and often I find the little \"problem\" the character
    is suffering from.\r\nIf I read before drawing, I'm so hooked up in \"rules\",
    \"proportions\", \"tendencies\" that every creativity is killed...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi Sebastian,\r\n\r\nI greatly appeciate you took the time to comment!
      To learn about font design I went through the string of reviews / posts on your
      Sofa font (which looks great!).\r\n\r\nI spend some time over the weekend and
      did the remaining lower case letters. During completion of this, I also start
      making some changes to the original version. I put in a sharp corner instead
      (as in Bembo) and did the same in the 'q' (not as in Bembo). \r\n\r\nOne of
      the things I wonder about as a beginner, is how rigid one needs to stick to
      the design language, especially for a text font (which seems to me like the
      'high-school' of type)\r\n\r\na: I wasn't happy with it also. I put it upright,
      removed 'tension' and tweaked the bowl.\r\n\r\nd: Changed the bowl to be more
      to the left. The stress is now more to the left. I tried to do that with the
      b and the q as well.\r\n\r\nh: I made it a bit wider than the n. (as outlined
      in the Desiginging Type book). But I have the feeling that there may be a bit
      too much white in the counter.\r\n\r\nr: Made some changes here to make it thicker.
      I homed in on the 'swash' a the common theme in this font (a, c, f, j, r and
      the y). \r\n\r\nAlso, I moved away from the spurs in the b and q. They didn't
      seem to belong in this font. Instead I used sharp corners (as the 'b' in Bembo).
      One of the things I wonder as a beginner is how strict the use of certain design
      elements is in a text font (which seems to be the most rigorous branch of the
      art). For instance, in Bembo the 'b' has a sharp corner, but the q has a spur.
      Would it be \"ok\" to have a font in which the 'b' and the 'q' are identical
      in 'design language'?\r\n\r\nI use the Designing Type book more or less the
      same way lately. When I do a group of letters I look up the general 'rules'
      and then start drawing and wrangling Beziers. Also, I printed a number of samples
      of fonts I like and look at how diferent elements are used in those fonts.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
      thanks again for your feedback. I hope you can have a quick peek at my updated
      version.\r\n\r\nSebastian"
