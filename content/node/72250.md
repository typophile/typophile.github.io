  body: "It seems to be a regular hyphen, albeit with a fairly non-standard design.
    It might be to match the rest of the font.\r\n\r\n\"To-night\", \"To-morrow\",
    with a hyphen, are ye olde spelling variants -- see also \"To-day\" on the bottom
    of the 2nd image."

  body: Thanks. I guess in context (spelling conventions) it had to be a hyphen, but
    I was worried there was some special archaic glyph in the world of hyphens and
    dashes that I hadn't seen before.

    I think it has this hyphen and the en-dash and em-dash. Nothing else.

    circa 1892 for MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan / ATF. The 1902 italic version for ATF
