  it's a custom job or not with those concave sides. \r\n\r\nThanks, Ben\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Levis_6173.jpg]"

  body: "It really feels like frutiger, but slightly bowled on the sides.\r\nCan\xB4t
    think of one that is bowled like that. Besides, the \"s\" is altered, unbalanced...
    I believe to be customed.\r\nHope it helps..."

  body: "I think it feels more like Optima, It's not though, the s is definitely not
    an optima s, the v is balanced and the counter of the e is wider. \r\n\r\nI'll
    agree with Sandro, Myriad is a better base to start with. "
