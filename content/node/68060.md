body: I am a designer, and over the past 2 years I have created several typefaces
  (Latin 9). I have done this at my salaried job. I also do freelance design and have
  recently been asked to give someone a quote for a Latin 9 San-serif character set.
  Does anyone out there have a general pricing guide they use for freelance type design?

  body: Much also depends on whether the customer wishes to own the resulting design
    and font completely, exclusively for a limited period of time, or non-exclusively.
    This determines your potential for future earnings from the design.

  body: "John Hudson,\r\n\r\nMy customer wants a quote for completely owning the font
    as well as an exclusive license. I would be creating the font for them (custom
    design), so as far as licensing goes how could I charge a different fee for licensing
    if they are actually paying me to design the font from scratch? Is that possible?
    I figure it will take me 125 - 150 hours to build it and will likely out source
    the hinting. Any thoughts? "

  body: May be I miss something, but could you explain how many weight will you draw?.
    How many glyph will you plan to draw? Is you typeface will included some ligature,
    OSF? Which language, basic Werstern Europe (256 glyphs) or more? Also, do you
    plan to draw both roman an italic. At first sight I found 125 - 150 hours is quite
    too low.

    They only want a regular weight, sans-serif typeface and they wish to completely
    own it in the end. I will design the font, but I will outsource the hinting.  I
    do not want to under sell myself or Price Gouge either. Any advice will be awesome.\r\n\r\nLatin-9,

  body: If your client licensed an off-the shelf design for an enterprise license
    they would pay anywhere from $6000-$12,000 and perhaps more depending on the font.
    You are creating a unique font for their exclusive use. So...

  body: "Terminaldesign,\r\n\r\nThanks, you are confirming that my quote will be pretty
    fair. I was told by a co-worker that the average license was around $10,000. Do
    you know if $6,000-$12,000 includes a font family (regular, bold, italic) or just
    one specific typeface?"

  body: Those are single font estimates. Certainly if more than one font was licensed
    the price per font might be lower.

  body: "Aaron: <em>Latin-9, 192 Glyph, Regular weight Sans-serif typeface.</em>\r\n\r\n$7,680
    for design. $5,760 for TrueType hinting. $480 per diem for other work (e.g. OpenType
    Layout, mastering and testing).\r\n\r\nJames: <em>Certainly if more than one font
    was licensed the price per font might be lower.</em>\r\n\r\nAlthough the opposite
    might be the case in custom type design. If a client can assure me that they will
    never want more than just the single weight and style, my job is much easier than
    if I have to consider how the type will fit within a family."

  body: "I suppose a non-exclusive license on a custom commission would have a substantial
    discount. By what percent I would defer to someone else's opinion, but the relatively
    high price of the exclusive license is as it is because it precludes further sales.
    \r\n\r\nIt's kind of a little small bit like winning the lottery, and they offer
    you the choice of collecting the prize in 20 annual installments or giving up
    half to collect the other half of it all at once. It's not exactly analogous,
    since long-term sales of a font are not guaranteed, but I think my meaning isn't
    completely murky.\r\n"
