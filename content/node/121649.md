  body: "Sorry, but I wasn\u2019t able to get a hit when searching databases, and
    no larger samples appear to be available. The italics have a passing resemblance
    to Walbaum, but the rest isn\u2019t a match....\r\n\r\nMs. Fischer does design
    typefaces as well, though it doesn\u2019t appear to match any she shows in her
    portfolio. She may be kind enough to tell you the name of the typeface if you
    ask:\r\nhttp://www.maria-fischer.com/en/contact_en.html"

    contain a roman lowercase |d|; compare it to the |d| in Fluena). '
