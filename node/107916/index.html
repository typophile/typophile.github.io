  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am reading through the license for Eames by House Industries:

"If you are an advertising agency, acting on behalf of an advertising agency or otherwise acting in a similar capacity or for the benefit of a third party, the purchase of a license for your client is required..."

Does this mean that I have to purchase a license for this font every time I use it for a different client if I am an independent designer?  That isn't how I have understood font licenses to work.

Also,

"The user of this House Industries font software agrees to credit House Industries as the trademark and copyright owner of the House Industries fonts and list the font names, wherever and whenever design, production, or any other credits are shown."

This seems a little absurd.  Does this mean whenever the font is used, it must be identified/credited at the bottom of the design or something?  I know that Old Navy uses Eames in their in-store displays, website, and even on their apparel, and I didn't see the font 'credited'.  </div>

House Industries license reads, in part: "...agrees to credit House Industries as the trademark and copyright owner of the House Industries fonts and list the font names, wherever and whenever design, production, or any other credits are shown."

In other words, if other credits (for instance Set Designer: John Smith) are given then credit must also be given for House Industries if their fonts were used.</div>

Has anyone ever bought a font that required you to buy an additional license each time you used it on a design for a different client?</div>

I assume they're thinking that clients sometimes ask the designer to email them copies of the fonts when the project is done (for future editing, etc.). 

And that does indeed happen occasionally, although in my experience it doesn't happen very often, because clients also need the native files to do any editing, and small clients don't own the necessary software (InDesign, Photoshop or whatever), and larger corporate clients usually understand the issue of licensing already.</div>
