  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">When it comes to down to my neighborhood, I think of antique stores with big letters and fancy script to show age and importance. When you live on a street named Magazine, the fonts better grab the attention of people. It does seem that the boutique shop lined street of Magazine really could be a well layed out print magazine intertwined with restaurants and residential housing. The font on every store window or sign is carefully selected in order to draw people in and that is what amazes me about font and the ability for it to make or break a business or even neighborhood. The power of font is one that most do not realize but as I learn and study more I&rsquo;ve come to understand, font is just another layer of who you are.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Magazine is a pretty unique spot being that the shops appeal to so many different types of people. I agree that just looking at the sign does let you know who shops there, very similar to what I said a few weeks ago about the restraunts. Just by the way a store presents itself through it&rsquo;s logo and style of advertisement, a person can automatically tell what the clientel of the store is like. The stores on Magazine appeal to hipsters, yuppies, tourists, old ladies that are antique shopping, all of which can be fore told by the signage in any particular window of the store.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Almost every sign on Magazine Street in New Orleans has been hand painted by the Mystic Blue Sign Company.</p>
<p>Some were designed by local designers, Tom Varisco and Adam Newman in particular.  According to local membership in AIGA, the national association for design, there may only be 40 professional designers around.  If you have a moment stop into Mystic Blue.  Eve, the proprietor, is a master typographer–she was once courted by Microsoft for her type knowledge.</p>
<p>Eve is also a master engraver but, she told me, she could not make a living at engraving when she moved to New Orleans so she opened up her sign shop instead.</p>
<p>Local economy dictates the choices that we make.  And the look of our streets in the signage we have, too.</p>
