  body: I like Trademarker. Serpentine is like Crillee- too overused.

  body: Tiffany I used your suggestion of Trademarker. I needed a quick logo for a
    package design I was doing last week. My client liked the feel of Crillee but
    was open to an alternative. Here is the finished product. My client loved it.
