    anyone has a specimen?"

    Alphabet Thesaurus 3, so House Industries should have the film masters...

  body: "Bristol (1929), Carlton (1929) and Savoy (1936) were drawn by Dick Dooijes
    (under supervision of Sjoerd Hendrik de Roos) for Lettergieterij Amsterdam. They
    were based on Broadway by Morris Fuller Benton.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Lettering Inc. made
    a film font of Bristol (and a outline version called Bristol Open).\r\n\r\nThe
    now defunct Bright Ideas made a digital version of Bristol called Beardsley (they
    added a lowercase to the typeface).\r\n\r\nHere are some specimen:\r\nhttp://home.planet.nl/~voogt053/Bristol.bmp\r\nhttp://home.planet.nl/~voogt053/Carlton.bmp\r\nhttp://home.planet.nl/~voogt053/Savoy.bmp\r\n"
