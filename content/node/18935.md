  the work they commissioned from H. Zapf in the late 1960s? There are some very nice
  faces there that as far as I know have never been digitized.

  body: "Zapf's dozen or so fonts that he designed for Hallmark between 1967 and 1972
    are still proprietary and are therefore not commercially available. Athough originally
    created for photocomp, a new and more flexible medium for type design than metal
    at the time, they have all been digitized by Hallmark's in-house font development
    group.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of them though. Rick Cusick (now in charge of font
    development at Hallmark) has written a very nice article about Zapf's Hallmark
    fonts that appears on pages 24-29 of the book/catalog for the Zapfest Exhibit,
    San Francisco, 2001. The article contains a two page spread with one line examples
    of all of the fonts that Zapf produced for Hallmark. I find one of the most intriguing
    ones to be Hallmark Textura as blackletter fonts are noticably absent from the
    reperotoire of this reknown German type designer. The book is entitled \"Calligraphic
    Type Design in the Digital Age: An Exhibition in Honor of the Contributions of
    Hermann and Gudrun Zapf\", John Prestianni, editor, Gingko Press.\r\n\r\nHallmark
    did release Gudrun Zapf von Hesse's font Renaissance upon the request of  Linotype
    and the Zapfs to Linotype to sell a few years ago. They also released the film
    about Hermann Zapf that Hallmark produced in the late 60's to Linotype and a quicktime
    version is included on some of the CD's of Hermann's fonts. However, there are
    no plans to make Hermann's fonts available.\r\n\r\n(Thank you Miss Tiffany!)"
