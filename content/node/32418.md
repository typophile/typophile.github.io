    free typeface or alternatively a typeface that is very similar for free? Thanks.

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/improv/\" target=\"_blank\">Improv</a>
    is not free font and, since Agfa/MT took the ICG fonts over, they've been rather
    pricy.\r\n\r\nI can't think of anything free like Improv. You can do a search
    by Theme (style, really) on Dafont from the link to Flowerchild above to see if
    something free there is acceptably close.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/postino/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Postino</a> (actually a backslanted Postino Italic would be
    even closer) as a cheaper commercial alternative."

    Curtis's old freebies</a> for a possible Improv alternative. It has the kind of
    'retro' vibe that many of his fonts also have.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
