  body: In your screenshot, it looks like the 'x' in the Font window is grey rather
    than black, which suggests it's showing either the mask or bitmap layer, and the
    actual outline layer is either empty or has open paths. As for the spacing sliders,
    they only appear in Metrics Mode, not Text Mode.

  body: "Thanks you sir, I have figured it out.  My first attempt at my own complete
    font was relatively successful.  I have a vintage type book that I am scanning
    and turning into vectors to make TTF\u2019s but so very new at this and am having
    trouble with everything.  Going to need to work at it more but appreciate the
    help."
