  body: 'Pretty close, but in my opinion it is handwork. The /T is too wide in proportion
    to other characters; also note the distortion at the right bottom curve of the
    /S. Note that upper and lower rounded characters do not extend above and below
    the baseline. '

    the way this graphic has been produced...
