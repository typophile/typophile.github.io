body: I am designing a font that has alternate characters. I have assigned kerning
  to those characters. When i generate it as a postscript font, i loose the kerning
  values for the alternate chracters. I am placing these characters in 0172, 0174,
  0165, 0169. I am running fontographer  on xp proffesional. Does anybody know if
  postscript does not allow kerning on those character cells? <BR>Thank you for your
  help. <BR>Chuck Borges
