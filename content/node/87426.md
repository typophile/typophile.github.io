  checked all the surrounding glyphs W,X,Y n,o,p\r\nand there doesn't appear to be
  anything obviously wrong. \r\nNo spacing issues.\r\nNo Reversed paths.\r\nNo kerning

    technical. I have just tried that saving the font as a .ttf and .otf but still

    the problem.\r\n"

  body: "Are the characters only missing in the Quick Look preview? I've come across
    a couple of fonts where the 'X' was missing in Quick Look\u2014 both were all-caps
    fonts with double-encoded glyphs and extended Latin characters. They otherwise
    functioned normally, and running fontQA reported no other obvious issues. I figure
    it must have had something to do with the encoding (re-encoding seemed to fix
    it), but no clue whether it's just a glitch with Quick Look or indicative of a
    real issue within the font. Although I've never seen a missing 'o' and your font
    obviously isn't single-case, it might be worth trying Reencode Glyphs or Generate
    Unicode from the Glyph menu > Glyph Names."

    then, that they are disallowed HTML tags. Try using &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; instead.
