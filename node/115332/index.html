  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m a longtime lurker. I finally made an account because I thought this might be a group that can help provide insight to a question I&rsquo;ve been stumbling with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through my first experience hiring a junior designer. The applications I&rsquo;ve received are all over the place &ndash; some outstanding, some hilariously unqualified to do professional design work, and some just tragically bad.</p>
<p>I find that I receive frequent requests from the last category inquiring why they weren&rsquo;t selected or what they could do to improve themselves. When it&rsquo;s a matter of not fulfilling all the qualifications for software proficiency or having rampant typos in their resumes, writing a quick critical response is easy (&ldquo;unfortunately, you do not currently meet the qualifications posted for this position&rdquo;, &ldquo;unfortunately, your writing shows that your attention to detail and communication skills need improvement&rdquo;).</p>
<p>But when someone is versed in the programs and wrote a nice cover letter and resume &hellip;. but their work is just bad, I&rsquo;m at a loss for a way to quickly communicate that without sounding like a jerkface. I work at a small business that&rsquo;s active in the community (chances are I might run into a couple of these people someday) and I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of constructive criticism, but saying that their taste level lacks sophistication still just seems  harsh. Am I just being a softie? I&rsquo;d love to get into the nitty gritty about what missteps they&rsquo;re making with type, color, layouts, etc., but it would just be too time consuming.</p>
<p>Anyone have ideas or experiences with this to share?</p>
<p>tldr?
How do you constructively tell a job applicant that their work lacks sophistication or that they don&rsquo;t demonstrate a good taste level?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my experience, there&rsquo;s a job out there for designers of all levels of sophistication. If an applicant&rsquo;s work is not at the quality levels that you expect at your organization, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with letting them know that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a good match&rdquo; or &ldquo;not what we&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;ve met many designers who didn&rsquo;t make it through our process who have gone on to great jobs and fulfillment elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you had all the time in the world, you could sit with each applicant and coach them through how they could improve their work. In my heart of hearts, I often feel the same way. But who truly has that kind of time? If you found a junior designer you believed in and exhibited other desirable qualities (cultural fit, proactiveness, humility, eager to learn/grow) that in-depth coaching might make better sense if they were employed with you.</p>
<p>If your workday is anything like mine, time is precious and almost always at a deficit. Unfortunately, you may have to ask yourself: Is providing feedback to applicants the best use of my time?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re totally on the same page, Jared. I&rsquo;m trying to find the balance between sounding curt and wasting my time giving thoughtful feedback to strangers. The responses I give are along the lines of your examples, but they also generate a lot of follow-ups asking for clarification. And <em>that&rsquo;s</em> where I get hung up.</p>
<p>I thought I had hit a good phrasing the other day &ndash; &ldquo;Keep developing your skills, and stay up to date with the standards and trends of the industry through blogs, publications, and professional groups&rdquo; &ndash; but it didn&rsquo;t go over so well. Using it twice, I got one snarky response that accused me of not actually looking at his portfolio since I didn&rsquo;t give specific feedback, while the other decided it was an invitation to turn this exchange into an in-depth portfolio review to get specific feedback. This is when I start to wonder, do I just tell them their work looks unrefined? That the multi-colored papyrus on their resume shows a poor taste level (true story)? I thought my response was sound, fair advice, so maybe it&rsquo;s just the best I can hope for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Jared&rsquo;s comments. And it&rsquo;s certainly not necessary to say negative things about their work, you could just say &ldquo;another candidate fit our needs better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, when I was just out of college several interviewers gave me some friendly advice about my portfolio and I found it very helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there&rsquo;s a job out there for designers of all levels of sophistication</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true. I&rsquo;ve known unsophisticated designers who made a nice living doing supermarket flyers, newspaper ads, and other work that didn&rsquo;t require much finesse. One of them makes more money than I do.</p>
