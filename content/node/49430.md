  If so, what kind of fonts? Urdu? Latin calligraphy?\r\n\r\nWe are working on [[http://www.princexml.com|Prince]],
  a web-to-PDF conversion tool that has come up on these forums in the past in relation
  to CSS and web fonts. We want to support OpenType properly in our next release,
  so we have been busy adding support for ligatures, kerning, mark positioning and
  shaping rules for Arabic and Hindi. However, when we tried to implement support
  for cursive positioning (the \"curs\" feature) we could not find any fonts that
  used it, making it impossible for us to test it.\r\n\r\nDo you think it is worthwhile
  for us to support cursive positioning in Prince, or is this OpenType feature rarely
  used in practice?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I believe Microsoft's [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=283|Arabic
    Typesetting]] font supports it.

    :)\r\n\r\nDo you know if any Latin cursive fonts support it, or are they more
    likely to use context-sensitive kerning instead?"

  body: "Latin cursive fonts almost exclusively use \"calt\" and \"kern\". I have
    not seen a single Latin font that would use \"curs\" as the none of the Adobe
    OpenType Layout engines does not support it (AFAIK). To my knowledge, \"curs\"
    is only supported in Microsoft Uniscribe. \r\n\r\nBTW, I found it quite surprising
    and amazing that you decided to write your own OpenType Layout engine rather than
    relying on an existing opensource solution such as ICU Layout. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Any nasta'liq style Arabic font, the typical style for Urdu, is likely to
    utilise cursive attachment positioning. As Miguel, notes, the MS Arabic Typesetting
    font (naskh style), supports this feature.\r\n\r\nAdobe's lack of support for
    cursive attachment positioning, even in the Middle East versions, has been a strong
    discouragement to more widespread use of the feature. I have plans for Arabic
    fonts which rely on this feature, but which I would not bother to implement until
    I know they will work in InDesign ME.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for additional
    fonts with this cursive attachment lookups for test purposes, I recommend joining
    the VOLT user community group on MSN. There are a number of people developing
    nasta'liq fonts, who would probably be glad to assist you."

    thanks for the info! We would like to support nasta'liq style fonts in the future.\r\n\r\nWe
    will prepare a beta version of Prince 7.0 for the Typophile and MSN VOLT communities
    to hammer on, and that will undoubtedly turn up a few issues we've missed. First
    though we have to add support for proper Latin small-caps; at the moment we don't
    apply the smcp feature, we just scale down uppercase glyphs, which I assume is
    a hanging offence in these parts :)"

    font based on Nastaleeq writing style. You may find Nafees Nastaleeq Font useful;
    it extensively uses cursive feature. The font is freely available with VOLT source
    code at [[http://crulp.org/software/localization.htm]]\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nBest Regards,\r\nAtif
