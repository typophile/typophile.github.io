body: "Some references state that the size of a printer's point in the English-speaking
  world was defined in 1886 on the basis of 83 picas being equal to 30 centimeters.\r\n\r\nOther
  sources state that while this was one of the proposals considered, the one actually
  adopted was the Johnson pica, which based the point on 1/72nd of 249/250ths of the
  British inch, not the American one, which still differed at the time.\r\n\r\nNeither
  of these standards, though, equal 0.013837 inches, which many sources give as the
  official printer's point.\r\n\r\nI've seen only one place on the Web acknowledging
  this discrepancy: a conversion table from Circuitous Root, which credits ATF with
  the modern printer's point as of 1902."

    can see that 60 picas (720 points) is visibly shorter than 10 inches, I suppose
    because of the 19th-Century difference between the British inch and the American
    inch. \r\nWhen desktop publishing software was developed in the 1980s, it was
    designed to allow users to switch units of measurement from inches to picas and
    back again, with the point defined as <em>exactly</em> 1/72 of a U.S. inch, which
    has become the new standard."

  body: The British and American inches were different up until 1964 (some sources
    give a date in the 1950s), and this has nothing to do with the size of the point,
    which is smaller than 1/72 of either inch.

  body: "I see that 0.013837 is given there as the Nelson C. Hawks point. But is that
    point therefore wrong, having been superseded, even though so many sources give
    it as the value?\r\n\r\nOn my page,\r\n\r\n[[http://www.quadibloc.com/other/cnv01.htm]]\r\n\r\nyou
    can see my thinking on this.\r\n\r\nI believe the sources that say Nelson C. Hawks'
    point was either 0.0138\" or exactly 1/72\", because he was the first person to
    propose the point system. It's a natural error to attribute the final point size
    of 0.013837\" to the first person in America to propose using a point system.
    (Attributing it to Fournier or Didot, though, is a harder mistake to make, as
    there's well-known history in between.)\r\n\r\nSince the sources I've found on
    the web don't even agree on whether the 83 picas to 35 centimeters point, or the
    249/250 of a survey foot point won out at the meeting in 1886, and that meeting
    is very obscure, skipping over it doesn't surprise me.\r\n\r\nWait - 249/250 is
    0.4% smaller than unity, not 0.325% or 0.375% smaller - maybe I've been fooled
    by a typo, and the Johnson pica is the right size...\r\n\r\nLegros and Grant claim
    in Typographical Printing-Surfaces that indeed the point of MacKellar, Smiths
    and Jordan, accepted as the standard in the 1886 meeting, held in Niagara, was
    the modern 0.013837\" foundry point. This is at least plausible, even if it requires
    Wikipedia to be wrong."
