    afii or uni?\r\n\r\nI am using afii in my latest font but that's because there's
    a whole lot of OpenType re-encoding implications to changing a batch of glyph
    names and there are already <a href=\"http://postdesk.com/christmas2011/erik-spiekermann/\">not
    enough hours in the day</a>."

    names.\r\n\r\nIf  you have coding to fix, either search and replace the painful
    one glyph at a time way and check the box \"update name in Opentype features\"
    \ Or just save your .fea file and search and replace afii names with uni names.
    \ Then, reimport the updated. fea file."
