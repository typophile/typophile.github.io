  body: Guys, please butt out. <BR> <BR>We would prefer if male typophiles respect
    this area of Typophile as a place where only women post.. So far it is not working
    very well. It is perhaps not very clearly posted. I&#39;m sure this can be remedied
    somehow. <BR> <BR>One tactic that I find women using more often than men, and
    I have no idea why, is that we often continue to carry on our own vital conversations
    and ignore any troll who might wish to sidetrack us with arguments that are both
    dull and silly. That is what was happening here, and the strategy was fairly successful.
    <BR> <BR>This area is currently visible to all so that both men and women can
    learn from the way women interact with one another and view a particular part
    of the typophile world. One of the best ways male typophiles could learn is by
    repressing the urge to post and, instead, to watch how we women prefer to handle
    these situations. <BR> <BR>I do appreciate the good intentions in your posts.
    I don&#39;t appreciate your inability to respect our request that you not post
    here at all. <BR> <BR>

  body: Compugraphic and Monotype were one of the few companies and this industry
    of type making had more woman managers than probably any other company producing
    machines. At CG I had a man middle manager on the second shift but the first shift
    it was a woman, and her boss a woman, and her boss a man. Then the late eighties
    it was a woman that headed the whole place. The drawing office had more men than
    woman and the first shift did too. The second shift it was about 50%. And not
    everyone was of the same race about more diverse than the general public. The
    more manual labour jobs were more blokey. At Microsoft and in most tech jobs it&#39;s
    more men in the engineering sections, more woman in the &#39;consumer&#39; groups
    and more woman as admins. In England it&#39;s a whole new ball game. You can ask
    anyone even a woman to make tea for you if they are making it. Watch &#39;The
    Office&#39; on BBC &#40;America ?&#41; and you&#39;ll get an earfull of culture
    you won&#39;t find in Springfield.. Even Lowri Turner shocked me on Shopping City
    &#40;2000&#41; at 5pm with her comment to a woman trying on a top &#39;look at
    the cleavage on you&#39;. God bless the English &#40;and Welsh too&#41;.

  body: as a Yank living in London I get to see how the non Americans act less worried
    about being sued or sacked so they say it like it is. That is pretty general but
    common. I saw a 45 year old woman in a car park ask 3 young males for change for
    the parking machine. That&#39;s what I love about England less racism, less fear,
    and a bit more freedom even with out rules for segregation to get equality. You
    could only find a place like Alphabetty in America. This is the ironic bit. My
    favourite difference is with my car keys for my two Audis. One is made for America
    and one made for England. The American key has a red button with the words &#39;PANIC&#39;
    on it, the english one doesn&#39;t. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14091.jpg"

    too is the American car has that annoying beepy noise if you leave the door open
    with the keys in. The English one doesn&#39;t nag so much and goes at a wicked
