  body: If I had brought the appropriate materials, I would have asked to make a rubbing
    of it.  :-) Got a limited edition of the specimen sheet instead....

  body: "You're quite welcome -- we had only intended (and Jim had only booked) 30
    minutes there, and we were there almost 90.  ;-)  At least I could give y'all
    a vicarious thrill.\r\n\r\n(Of course, it also didn't hurt that Jim knew my uncle,
    who had been the Linotype machine repair person when New Westminster had its own
    \"local\" paper....)"
