body: "Hi everyone, \r\n\r\nAs part of a research degree I would love to interview
  anyone who works on exhibitions or is part of a design team for a gallery, museum
  or arts program. My research will look into the growing use of type in exhibitions,
  and look at the value of typefaces when curating and promoting exhibitions, and
  how choosing appropriate type faces is essential for marrying artwork, photography
  and other types of exhibitions with information.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested
  in being part of this research and would later like to be interviewed, please reply
  to this forum post - and thanks a million!\r\n\r\nWillie  "
