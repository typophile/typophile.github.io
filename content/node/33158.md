  the typeface used on this picture; http://wtf.myfonts.com/images/a1/a167b91fe4692a44bbbd34e6593af579.8646.jpeg\r\n\r\nI
  do have an outlined (the original) version if it could help you, though I doubt
  it even exists separately.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance & blame Canada.\r\n/pico"

    not quite resemble my sample.\r\n\r\nShould I fear the worst; that it's custom
    designed?"
