  FREUDE); Mike Yanega thinks it might be a hybrid typeface (Gill sans Infant with
  l, t, u and M out of Futura/Twentieth Century) and suggested to post it here.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone another idea? Is it common to mix typefaces? Sorry, I am not a professional
  so please bare with my naive questioning.\r\n\r\nI would like to use the font for
  a publication, I find it very elegant...\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for helping me!!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oetker_0020_3428.JPG]"

  body: "I'm surprised there has been no response yet on this question. Is this a
    modified version of Gill Sans Schoolbook (Infant), or is it truly a hybrid typeface,
    mixing Gill with a Futura-like type?\r\n\r\nI suggested that Ralf post this here,
    becuase I was hoping someone else might know whether type mixing was a common
    practice to create a 'new' type look.  I know I am one of the older folks on this
    forum, but my background in type is based in my books, and not on firsthand experience
    in the field of typography. I was an engineer, not a typographer.\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: "i seem to remember reading that Monotype tried several different attempts
    to Futur-ize Gill and this may be one of those permutations. If this is the case,
    I doubt that there has been any digital version made of this particular model.\r\nYou
    could get pretty close with P22 Underground Pro Light + several of the stylistic
    sets activated, but even that would not give you an exact match (there's no splayed
    M, no single-story a with tail, no stem-less u--i had to stop with customizing
    options somewhere)."

  body: Wow, look at the spacing on the lc s. I really like the feeling though. And
    the lc b is pretty sweet I think.

    the '\xFC' not with the stem-less u... "

  body: I am not so hot on the Q but the M is kind of fun. The thing that is striking
    to me as I look again is the way the caps separate from the lc like ( as I have
    understood it ) you tend to see more in fonts made for English. Maybe that impression
    is just and artifact of the exaggerated scale. Hmm. Probably it is.
