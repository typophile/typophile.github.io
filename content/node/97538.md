  can't identify the condensed sans-serif typeface used by Utrecht in nearly all of
  their promotional materials\u2014 I thought it might have been Folio Condensed or
  Anzeigen Grotesk at one point, but Folio Condensed (at least the light version)
  seems to have a lower x-height, and Anzeigen comes only in bold and the capital
  \"R\" is markedly different.\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRobert"
