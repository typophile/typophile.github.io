  body: "Hi onathanhughes,\r\n\r\nMonologue has started quite well and it will evolve
    quite nicely eventually.\r\nThe relative widths of the capitals and the lower
    case letterforms could be similar to those of Eurostile Next Condensed. Or even
    better. go to the following link and look at typefaces in the same species as
    \u2018Monologue\u2019, actually Monologue looks more than the typefaces on the
    following link than DINish\u2026.\r\n\r\nEUROSTILISH\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/list?3+Eurostile%20Condensed+1+IE8+7+N8N+7+J3V+4+MJY+4+MJW+4+BQW+4+BQX+4+5PK+4+E0Z+4+R4+4+D7Q+4+HN1+4+HN2+4+HN3+4+HOI+4+HOB+4+IE7+4+CGK+4+F0H+4+KLI+4+6BT+4+BU2+4+MYY+4+EDV+3+VM+3+MQZ+3+HTI+3+9O7+3+9NV+3\r\n\r\nYou
    will find there 29 typefaces with relatively similar attributes. \r\n\r\nDINish\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?similar=DIN&q=Go\r\n\r\nYou
    will find there 29 typefaces with relatively similar DINish attributes. \r\n\r\nThe
    construction of lower case \u2018s\u2019 is better than that of capital \u2018S\u2019.
    \r\n\r\n\u2018Some concerns I have are about width (D, J, M, S, W, m), and the
    balance of upper and lower parts (g, S).\u2019\r\n\r\nD: looks relatively OK.\r\nJ:
    It could either drop below the baseline for better spacing or it could have the
    lower part of \u2018C\u2019 reflected but shoter.\r\nM: A little wider and with
    ink traps added.\r\nS: C, G, S, a, c, J, j and y they would better have similar
    \u2018beaks\u2019 \u2013 \u2018stroke endings\u2019. Either like those of \u2019C\u2019
    or \u2018G\u2019, or even just straight horizontal.\r\nW: Make it a little wider
    and add ink traps.\r\nm: In relation to \u2018n\u2019 it looks relatively OK.\r\nS:
    The diagonal stroke should move a little downwards and very slightly the diagonal
    of \u2018s\u2019.\r\ng: Its ear on the x-height should be a little longer.\r\nj,
    y: the end-stroke below the baseline could become a little horizintalized.\r\n\r\nThe
    metrics need fine tuning.\r\n\r\nI hope all the above will be of some use.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way I just posted some more things to Critique/San Serif/ Doric, you are welcome
    to tell me what you think about it.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBoris\r\n"
