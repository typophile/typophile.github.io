  a bit at my wits end fining the Typeface used on the \"blueprints\" on the Engineer
  Update page for Team Fortress 2. I know the stuff in all caps is definitely another
  typeface, but I'm more interested on the \"body\" text. I feel like I\u2019ve seen
  it before, but can\u2019t remember for the life of me where.\r\n\r\nAttached is
  a bit of said \"body\" text, and below is the update's page for a better look.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/engihandsample_6696.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teamfortress.com/engineerupdate/\r\n\r\nI'm
  aware brush/handwriting fonts are difficult to identify, so I wish you the best
  of luck, and thank you regardless of whether or not this gets resolved. I\u2019ll
  be continuing my search on my end as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
