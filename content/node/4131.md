  body: ' Your &#39;Q&#39; looks, perhaps, too close to an &#39;R&#39;. And while
    the double &#39;I&#39; makes visual sense, it causes readability problems. The
    boldness, however, of the black and red mark is very nice and seems appropriate
    for the company -- from what you&#39;ve told us. '
