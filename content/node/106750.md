  if this was custom lettering or an actual font; as well as being a font fan, I love
  retro gaming and would like to use a font similar to this for a titling font for
  a project."

  body: Microgramma Bold Extended looks really close... might be a digitized vs print
    difference... then again, so does Eurostile Bold Extended... and I have Square721
    BT (part of the fonts that came with WordPerfect) so that will do quite nicely!
    Doesn't need to be an exact match, just close enough for my purposes.
