body: Back in about 1996 I developed an interest in fonts and started making some.  I
  used Fontographer, the only program I knew of at the time.  I had a lot of fun,
  but I haven&#39;t done anything since then. <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;d like to get back
  into things.  Not only that, but my mother is interested and wants to learn as well.  We
  have slightly different goals, but I&#39;m hoping to gather some advice from all
  you experts about what software would be the best buy to meet our needs. <BR> <BR>I
  have a background in graphics design, and I just LOVE fonts, for reasons I don&#39;t
  think I need to explain to this audience!  I work with Photoshop a lot, but not
  with very many other graphics programs &#40;though I am quick to learn&#41;.  I&#39;d
  love to be able to create my own fonts to meet specific needs, and also just because
  it&#39;s art and it&#39;s fun. <BR> <BR>My mother is a schoolteacher, and her interest
  in fonts is primarily for her classroom.  She&#39;d like, among other things, to
  be able to make a font of her own printing, plus various cute, theme-based letterings
  &#40;animals, flowers, etc.&#41; that can be personalized more than the downloadable
  freebies out there &#40;we&#39;re talking pictures with letters pasted on top probably
  - nothing very fancy&#41;.  She is not very experienced with any design software
  though, so if this stuff is too complicated, it won&#39;t work for her &#40;she
  does have 2 capable people to help her out though, but even then there are limits&#41;.  Also,
  since it&#39;s just for her own personal use and satisfaction, the &#34;good enough&#34;
  motto applies. <BR> <BR>We both use Windows &#40;2000, probably XP sometime soon&#41;.  From
  what I have read, Fontographer seems easiest to use, but Fontlab sounds more flexible.  Can
  anybody comment?  Also, there seem to be a myriad of smaller, cheaper programs,
  but I can&#39;t tell for certain whether they will be a good enough starting place
  for us, or if we are better off with one of the big ones. <BR> <BR>Sorry for such
  a lengthy post, but when we are considering forking out $550 US &#40;which is more
  like $800 Canadian, for us&#41; it&#39;s a big enough investment that I want to
  make sure we make the right choice.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Looking forward to some interesting comments and
  advice!  Thanks everyone, <BR> <BR>Julie <BR>

  body: Julie <BR> <BR>FontLab is also selling a light version of its software called
    TypeTool. You can download a demo &#40;and manual&#41; from the FontLab site.
    I think it only costs about $100. About the same as Fontographer.

  body: Fontographer is most likely powerful enough to do what you need, but it&#39;s
    a dead end. So I&#39;d second Gerald&#39;s suggestion. Also, in the case of your
    mom, she might be better off drawning the letters on paper &#40;or maybe even
    in something like Illustrator&#41;, but leaving the gory stuff like spacing, encoding,
    etc. to somebody else - maybe you! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: FontLab also has a product called ScanFont which acts as a plug-in for either
    TypeTool or FontLab. It will take a scan of the complete character set and somewhat
    automate the process. Also available as a demo with downloadable manual. Another
    $100. And then there is TransType, a font format converter. Demo, manual, another
    $100. FontLab, yeah, they got it figured out.

    probably qualify as a teacher.  It&#39;s about half off. <BR> <BR>David

  body: At this time, I&#39;d recommend almost anything that isn&#39;t Fontographer.
    It is, as Hrant says, a dead end &#40;at least at this time&#41;. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
