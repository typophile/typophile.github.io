  body: "Thanks Penn for your interest.\r\nTo be perfectly honest, I didn't understand
    your advice... (google translator is useless English->Polish).\r\nHere is  a part
    of the map I made some years ago. I had a great problem with lettering on satellite
    image. Finaly I made black letters with white outline and names of villages in
    vibrant magenta. Some details http://mastertopo.com/maps/everest/index.htm\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mapa_5452.png]"
