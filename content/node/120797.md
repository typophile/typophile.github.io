body: "I'm going thru my type library, intent on using types I've not used in, like,
  forever, if ever. Though I love Univers--and I believe this book will have scientific
  formulae in it--with an Old Style serif--I also like the idea of trying something
  I've had around forever, but just never got around to using, Stone Serif and Stone
  Sans. But I'm concerned about the narrow width of the text column, a touch less
  than 20p. I'm figuring a generous leading, but would still like something that fits
  well, in a compact kind of way (but, of course, not a Times) without looking jammed
  in.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: It seems like this would have to depend on the formulae. If they require any
    complex math setting, there really aren't very many options. Minion is fairly
    compact and has a math companion.
