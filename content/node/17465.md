  body: "Your a true gentleman Si. The Seahawks have nothing to be ashamed of. They
    played a tough game and could have won if a few things had gone there way.  They
    got a bad call on the push-off penalty which was not too much of a push. Holmgren
    did a great coaching job too. The Seahawks will be back next year and better than
    ever. They are a class team.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/steelers_dog.jpg]"
