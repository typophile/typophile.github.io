  is a new geometric sans serif type family, and is the more rational sibling to the
  unabashedly Art Deco \"[[http://www.typetanicfonts.com/#Transat|Transat]]\". Transat
  Text has a slightly taller x-height than its counterpart, as well as more rationalized
  character widths, shorter descenders and fewer design eccentricities, making it
  easier to read in text settings. While designed to shine in paragraphs, it also
  performs admirably in larger display settings.\r\n\r\nTransat Text includes many
  OpenType features, such as ligatures, small capitals, case sensitive forms, stylistic
  alternates, arbitrary fractions, and a full complement of proportional, tabular,
  and oldstyle figures. With nearly 700 glyphs, it provides support for most European
  languages. The Transat Text family includes 5 weights plus optically-corrected obliques.\r\n\r\n<strong>Transat
  Text</strong> is currently available at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/transat-text/?refby=typetanic|MyFonts]],
  [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T4497/transat-text?affId=160188|YouWorkForThem]],
  and [[http://crtv.mk/dLKX|Creative Market]]. For a limited time, you can get the
  full family of 10 fonts for just <strong>$30</strong>."

    I just licensed it and it looks great! Thanks a lot!

    50% off. A $120 value for just $60.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>EDIT</strong>: Sorry everyone,
    but apparently MyFonts had some trouble running the \"buy one / get one\" campaign
    on their system. While the combo deal is no longer available, Transat Text is
    still available for $30 through August 3."

  body: "Thanks for all the kind words, everyone!\r\n\r\nSim, my decision to oblique
    the hyphen was just my aesthetic opinion \u2014 I've seen other fonts do it (most
    notably in my mind FontBureau's \"Whitman\") but not many sans serifs. I like
    the slight quirk that it gives the finished face and it also seems to add some
    motion to hyphenated words.\r\n\r\nI don't have any alternates for the hyphen,
    though all the dashes are the standard horizontal style."

    It wasn't a commissioned work, after all.."

  body: "The inclined hyphen isn't something unique to Whitman, similar hyphens are
    used in many other typefaces, particularly Venetian-style serifs like Adobe Jenson,
    Goudy Old Style and William Morris' Golden Type (Whitman just happened to be the
    first font that came to mind).\r\n\r\n<strong>EDIT:</strong> Charles, sorry \u2014
    I now understand what your comment was re: Whitman. I only said FontBureau because
    Kent's name escaped me for the moment and I only remembered the publisher. Generally
    if I know their name I do credit the designer when mentioning other typefaces."

  body: "In Nour&Patria I've given the dashes a gentle <em>perception</em> of slant
    -at text sizes- by shaping the ends like the wedge-serifs in the font, but facing
    in opposing directions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NandP_dash_4730.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    original motivation was that a plain rectangle doesn't feel like something that
    belongs in reading.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
