body: do you know of an application that does envelopeing &#40;sp&#41; really well?
  <BR>I want to do type on a radius, and so far I&#39;ve been drawing it by hand since
  the envelope tools in Illustrator and Fontlab are so primitive. I&#39;d have thought
  that there is an app that would properly curve the flats at baseline xheight and
  ascender levels, and maintain alignment. <BR>

    might have what you&#39;re looking for. They have a <a href="http://www.typestyler.com/pages/demodl.html">demo
    version</a> available - no OS X version yet though.

  body: Miles, Kai&#39;s Power Tools for illustrator <BR>is stuffed to the brim with
    envelopes <BR>and various stuff. <BR> <BR>I revert to Illustrator 6 to use it.
    I don&#39;t think <BR>it has any recent updates. Maybe you could <BR>find it on
    ebay. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also FilterIt.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.cvalley.com/"

  body: To get the level of detail that you describe, you will have to continue to
    draw it by hand. <BR> <BR>Not a bad thing. <BR> <BR>Why trust an algorhythm when
    the eye is so much more descerning.

  body: Illustrator CS does as well. But, as James as mentioned, even then, you&#39;ll
    have to finish it with the tweaking.

  body: Strangely enough Paint Shop Pro has been doing vector text on curves for a
    while, but its mainly a bitmap application, so its enveloping tools aren&#39;t
    that well developed.  <BR>It does do text on a radius though, and as far as I
    recall, it curves the flats pretty well at all heights.
