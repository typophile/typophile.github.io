body: Hello, typophiles. I am a designer currently working on screens for a satirical
  takeoff of American network news channels &#40;FOX, CBS, NBC, etc.&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Does
  anyone know what fonts are typically used on these channels for the &#34;infolines&#34;,
  meaning the bars at the bottom of the screen that deliver key information, e.g.
  names of places, people, &#34;Breaking News&#34;, etc.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s fairly
  obvious these fonts are fairly plain, condensed sans-serif fonts, but I can&#39;t
  seem to find any that really nail it.  <BR> <BR>Any help would be appreciated.

  body: 'I don&#39;t have a cable TV in front of me right now. But, if memory serves
    me right, Fox News uses Franklin Gothic bold and sometimes condensed. CNN &#40;and
    MSNBC?&#41; use Helvetica bold while CNN Headline News uses Helvetica in normal
    and light weights. CNN International uses Futura bold. All the channels do get
    creative and use a variety of fonts when big stories happen, practically designing
    a unique logo for each story, as in this example from CNN&#39;s coverage of the
    Shuttle Columbia tragedy: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64598.jpg"
    alt="CNN Columbia"> <BR> <BR>As a side note, I don&#39;t know why any of the channels
    use ALL CAPS in their tickers. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s an attempt to recall the
    outdoor &#34;zippers&#34; of yesteryear. But, it&#39;s a bad allusion compared
    to what they can do with today&#39;s better technology. For a great example of
    tickers done right see ESPN and, better still, ESPN News.'

    with some Times Bold thrown in for good measure. To wit: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64602.jpg"
