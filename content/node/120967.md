    really want to put a huge swash on it"

  body: "Actually most text fonts (and certainly the good ones) allocate more of the
    vertical space to the ascenders than the descenders. This is mostly because of
    letter frequency. What fonts have you been looking at?\r\n\r\nBy \"too timid\"
    I meant that the terminal of the descender could do a lot more than merely taper.
    It doesn't have to be huge though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hmm. Apparently some fonts have the same height for ascenders and descenders
    (like Minion or Proforma), but others have the ascenders longer like you said.
    I made the ascenders taller and the descenders shorter slightly but I think it
    looks a bit worse now, especially next to the capital letters and the \u2018t\u2019\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flowRoot4222_3759.png]\r\nAnd
    for the \u2018j\u2019, how does this look?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/j-test_5305.png]\r\nBut
    it would be inconsistent with the roman \u2018j\u2019, as well as the capital
    form\r\n\r\nBTW I made the capital Italics too:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rect4235_6732.png]"

  body: Actually taking off the extension on the ascenders, they are still 10.4% longer
    than the descenders (5.4% with the head-serif overshoot taken off) is that enough?

  body: "Even deducting the head-serif overshoot, Minion's ascenders are at least
    10% longer than its descenders. In Proforma it seems to be less than 5%, but it's
    there.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to nail down how much is enough, because it's not an exact
    science, and it depends on a number of things. But as a rule the more a font is
    serious about being read versus looking pretty, the greater the difference should
    be (up to some limit). I myself prefer ~20%.\r\n\r\nHere's my personal guideline
    of good descender length for a serious text face: when the \"g\" \u2013the most
    vertically \"needy\" descending letter\u2013 starts looking a bit too cramped,
    you're there. Because that's a good manifestation of the necessary balance of
    compromises.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "To me, looks more texty now.\r\n\r\nThe \"g\" could appear a little less
    small by having a larger top, flattening the bottom a bit.\r\n\r\nBTW I'd missed
    this before:\r\n<blockquote>it would be inconsistent with the roman \u2018j\u2019,
    as well as the capital form</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes, make the Roman one less timid
    too.\r\nBut the capital is a different story, because it plays a greater role
    in display than text.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "idk. I prefer tapered \u2018j\u2019s because they look more graceful to me
    and the blob on the end is either too distracting or awkwardly tiny. I think you
    can get away with blobbing the terminal more in the italic since it\u2019s more
    calligraphic and the stress is more diagonal, but not as much in the roman"
