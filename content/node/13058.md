  dingbat... This little fellow (<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0001130#detail\"target=\"_blank\">see
  veer's t-shirt</a>) has caught my attention a few times - always sitting by itself
  for no apparent reason. Is it just pretty? Or is there more to it than that? \r\n\r\nOr
  am I just being haunted by the thing?\r\n"

  body: "The Hedera was one of the first punctuation marks of Greek and Romans (beside
    Interpuncts). In the Middle Ages this meaning was forgotten and it became a decoration
    for title pages and so on. In Germany we also call it Aldus-Blatt, because the
    famous italien printer Aldus Manutius used it very frequently.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info"

    body: "Thanks Ralf, a great answer. I can rest a little easier now. Judging by
      the web pages I have found, it would seem that the Hedera/Aldus-Blatt has been
      given more recognition in Germany than in other countries (<a href=\"http://www.typography.de/ueberdenverlag/aldusblatt/\"target=\"_blank\">example</a>)...
      is that the case?\r\n\r\nI feel a little guilty that the meaning passed me by,
      although I am sure I am not alone...\r\n\r\nIn the <cite>Character Palette</cite>
      (Apple OS X 10.4) I have found the hedera listed under <cite>Ornamental Punctuation</cite>
      as a <cite>floral heart</cite> and a <cite>rotated floral heart bullet</cite>.
      Both in Zapf Dingbats. Now I am forced to ask three more questions:\r\n\r\n1/
      Is it commonly known in Europe as a hedera, but more commonly referred to as
      a floral heart in the States? (I am British).\r\n\r\n2/ Other than Dingbats,
      which character sets include the hedera?\r\n\r\n3/ Was the original use always
      as a bullet?\r\n\r\nPlease forgive my ignorance!"

    famous publisher of design and typography books (\"Hermann Schmidt Verlag\") uses
    it as their brand mark.\r\nBut I don't think the ancient roots and the name <i>Hedera</i>
    are well known in Germany or elsewhere. \r\n\r\nYou can find some more information
    in Parkes \"Pause and Effect \u2013 an introduction to the history of puntuaction
    in the west\" and in Paul Saenger's \"Space between Words\".\r\n\r\nI don't know
    which other typefaces include a Hedera. But if you find out more, please let me
    know. I would like to compare the different designs.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info"
