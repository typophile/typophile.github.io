  body: I would venture that they are all custom, except for the last one, which is
    good old <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bauhaus/medium/testdrive.html?s=BECKHAM&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Bauhaus</a>.  We&#39;ve had the Larsson jersey before with no
    answer.

  body: Frazer, note, Sports Jerseys = Big Business $. For that reason most are custom.
    The type pros here will give you good suggestions but you will probably have to
    modify the numbers and some of the letter forms yourself. The only other option
    is if the team logo is posted on a free logo site.
