  to be a little vector or font design issue. I was killing some time with drawing
  some letterforms in FontLab. And I just be coincidence opened up Joshua Dardens
  Freight Sans. And I saw something completely new to me, regarding the vector curves.
  I\u2019m not sure how to explain this, but I will try my best. It is as if all the
  control handles endpoints are linked or sticking together. So that you can\u2019t
  edit one without effect the opposite one. (I have added a picture too illustrate
  this, since I can\u2019t explain it proberly).  \r\n\r\nDo any one know how this
  is done or give me a clue? I have spend the last hour looking through FontLab trying
  to sort it out, but I can\u2019t. So look at the picture or even better if you have
  a font by Joshua Darden see or experience it for yourself (I guess everyone is more
  or less done the same way). \r\n\r\nThanks very much. "

  body: "Maybe I\u2019m drunk, but the graphic you linked to seems to me to be\u2026
    weird. \r\n\r\nAt the top of the counter it seems to be a cubic B\xE9zier curve
    (every on-curve point has 2 off-curve control points). This would be a PostScript
    curve. At the lower left part of the counter though, there are 4 off-curve control
    points which would be a B\xE9zier curve of 5th degree (??). The same holds for
    the outer curve. A quadratic B\xE9zier curve \u2013 in font tech terms: a TrueType
    outline \u2013\_has alternating on- and off-curve points. \r\n\r\nIf you are worrying
    about connected or not connected control points, I would say this is purely an
    alternative way of displaying the same fact. If you move one control point, the
    curve should behave exactly the same way in either case. I don\u2019t know too
    much about FontLab, but there definitely has to be an option for the display of
    curves.\r\n\r\nSo, if your font has <em>consistently</em> 1 (TrueType) or 2 (PostScript)
    off-curve points, everything should be fine.\r\n\r\nI hope I could help, and please
    correct me if I\u2019m drunk\u2026"

    What you envision to help your colleagues is already there, a subtle gray line

    a 2nd order curve can be expressed with 3rd order curves without loss of quality.
    In mathematical theory that is all correct, but the elements of those poor type

    (pOff1+pOff2)/2 (sorry for the odd notation) is far less obvious unless one knows

    is it important to visualize the touching point halfway between 2 off-curve points?
    Did you actually design your beautiful letterforms with 2nd order curves?\r\n\r\n<code>A
    cubic Bezier curve also has an implicit on-curve point exactly in the middle between
    the middles of the lines between the middles of the Bezier control vectors and
    the midpoint between the BCPs. Visualizing this might help understanding the effects
    of moving the on-curve points, but it doesn\u2019t help designing smooth curves.
    Equally to what you propose it would be confusing.\r\n\r\n<code>Not what is inside
    - between 2 off-curve points - but what is outside needs visualization, how do
    a range of off-curve points relate, are their distances equal or progressive.
    That's where tension can come from. Showing half distances (the implicit on-curve
    points) would obfuscate progressive distances. If off-point distances are 8, 10,
    12, your proposal would visualize 4 4 5 5 6 6. I think that is distracting.\r\n\r\n<cite>Writing
