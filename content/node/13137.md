body: "I'm making a (grayscale) pixelfont of an existing outline/print font.\r\n\r\nAlthough
  the bitmaps of the glyphs can only occupy integer pixel\r\nwidths, I need to assign
  to each glyph the non-pixel-integer set\r\nwidth from the outline font, which will
  (assumedly) be additioned\r\ncumulatively by the typesetting application, causing
  an occasional\r\nextra pixel shift, in order to match linebreaks/the_right_rag with\r\nthe
  equivalent setting in the \"source\" outline/print font.\r\n\r\nI assume the only
  way to do this is by assigning width adjustments\r\nto each glyph via hinting. I'm
  wondering if anybody can offer help\r\nin how best to do that, and what to worry
  about.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Question: When the hinting is applied it will need to be in whole pixel width
    increments - no? If that's the case maybe you can't match the source - you just
    have to improve the pixelfont directly. Or are you using some kind of substition
    of alternative greyscale bitmaps for sets of common combinations of characters...\r\n\r\nI
    am probably missing something since I haven't even seen a greyscale font in use
    yet ( that I know of ). "

  body: "I realized this morning that the issue simply is not an issue. I thought
    that a character in a pixelfont that has a non-pixel-integer width would cause
    subsequent glyphs to get misaligned... but they don't! So it turns out hinting
    is not even necessary. BTW, I also noticed -more like was reminded of- something
    else: apps like Photoshop use only the pixel-integer values from the bitmaps/rendering
    (not the actual em values) to place glyphs, while Word for example does use the
    underlying \"true\" width value (resulting in occasional unsightly gaps, but accurate
    line ends/breaks).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
