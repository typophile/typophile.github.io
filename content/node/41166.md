body: "So, I know this is not exactly a type identification topic but I have been
  using the Franklin Gothic family because it is so diverse and has a lot of condensed
  and compressed versions and I was wondering if anyone knew of any other great families
  I could be using. I am not a big fan of Helvetica or Univers (well not as much as
  I have come to love dear Franklin). But it would be nice to have some other new
  families to invest in that are Sans and have a great variety. Help me out? Oh and
  my favorite face is DIN 1451! So a slightly similar family would make my day! Thanks.\r\n"

  body: "One of the most versatile sans serif types is Meta Plus. I use it frequently.\r\n\r\nDespite
    your dislike of Helvetica, consider Helvetica Neue. It comes in six weights, in
    condensed, regular and expanded widths. If you have to set type in different sizes,
    and have to balance the weight of the type, this variety is extremely useful.\r\n\r\nInterstate
    is also a good choice, though a little cold."

    Meta is another beast to tame altogether. \r\nMeta is one of my favorites euro-flavors...
    for the knockout power alone. And now there's a Serif! holy cow!"
