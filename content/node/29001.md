    not the work of a type designer. Overall, I might suggest a heavy weight of Avant
    Garde Gothic, with a customized G and O.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    suitably shoddy! I want to try and recreate that industrial homemade feel so mixing
    and matching will probably do the trick.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTerry"
