  body: "I don't think so. I looked at the Bodoni, and it's really close..save for
    the caps. I don't think the swashes were done by hand..unless of course it was
    modified by someone....i'm crossing my fingers it's not.\r\n\r\nBTW, this font
    is used pretty extensively in Blueprint, so maybe they got it customised.."

  body: "Looks more like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=giambattista&x=0&y=0\"
    target=\"_blank\">Giambattista</a>, especially that lowercase h.\r\n\r\n\r\nedit:
    Yeah, it looks like they customized the Y from Giambattista Three script by removing
    a bit of the swirl, and the h from Giambattista One script--doesn't go as far
    below the baseline."

  body: This is not Giambattista but [[Gert Wiescher]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/wiescher/bodoni_classic_2/&sample_text=Ye%20history%20doesn't&sample_size=36">Bodoni
    Classic Chancery</a>. I suppose the h is an alternate character.
