  body: "As for the first image, I suspect that this an old generic hairline slab
    serif lettering design rather than a font as such.\r\nYou can get pretty close
    by using Nick Shinn's Bodoni Egyptian Pro Light Italic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BodoniEgyptianProLightItalic_6643.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?4XO\r\nThe
    C has a serifed lower terminal, but everything else is a match to the letterforms
    on the pencil, with some differences in emphasis.\r\nDon"
