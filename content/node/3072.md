body: I have been racking my brain all day and reading about exporting PC TrueType
  faces that work in Adobe products as well as Macromedia&#39;s. I am a Mac Fontographer
  user and it seems no matter what font generating application you use, the TT fonts
  on PC will have some odd conflict or don&#39;t name properly.  <BR> <BR>I will cut
  to the chase, does anybody know how to export PC TT properly &#40;in Fontographer
  or Fontlab&#41; so that all the fonts in a family will show up in Flash MX without
  using a font management program? I have had my friend that is well versed in Fontlab
  &#40;PC user&#41; look into it and he is stumped also. In theory, it should be a
  brainless task, but it seems whenever I try and properly generate a family, some
  app on either platform &#40;usually Macromedia&#41; gives me problems.  <BR> <BR>
  I know of shortcuts and older methods to make it work, but I am looking for someone
  that understands this problem a little better than most people do. It is late and
  I hope I am explaining myself properly, but this is driving me nuts. Anybody know
  why or how to generate in either platform in Fontographer or Fontlab so it lists
  &#34;properly&#34; in Flash MX for PC?  <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance. &#60;/font&#62;
