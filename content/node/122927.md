  from a book titled \"Is Paris Burning?\" and published by Simon and Schuster, Inc.
  in 1965.\r\n\r\nThis font is only used on the inside front and back flap as a title
  for the maps on both. I thought it was Akzidenz-Grotesk Bold but now I'm not so
  sure (it's not Helvetica either). The boxed orange letters shown with the type image
  are Akzidenz-Grotesk Bold from <a href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/akzidenz-grotesk/standard/'>Berthold</a>.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-David"

  body: "Yes, that seems very close (see attached image). However, I'm confused on
    the timeline \u2014 Berthold's website says AG Old Face was released in 1984,
    but the book I have was published in 1965 (well, that's the copyright date anyways).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ag-old-style-medium_3604.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ag-old-style-bold_4325.jpg]"

  body: "Akzidenz-Grotesk was released by Berthold in 1896 as a metal type -- digital
    came in the 1980s. Also available as metal type from Linotype and Intertype. Your
    book is definitely pre-digital so ignore the digital release dates.\r\nDigital
    versions are not necessarily a perfect match to the metal type.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks for the clarification. I'm going to go ahead and mark this as AG Old
    Face Bold. (Or is it Medium? I really can't decide).\r\n\r\nThanks again for the
    help!"
