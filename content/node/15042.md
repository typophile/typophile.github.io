  I want to improve and update my portfolio. Does anyone know of an online resource
  of example design/typography briefs I could work on?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers, Nick.\r\n\r\n  "

  body: You could always find some bad typography and rework it. You could start off
    by deconstructing it and writing your own brief for it. Might be good practice
    for art direction.
