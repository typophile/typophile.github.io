    Handmade Books</a> is a great visual reference, although it doesn't really go
    into detail on how to build. For that, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cover-Creative-Techniques-Beautiful-Journals/dp/0937274879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1273463503&sr=1-1">Cover
    to Cover</a> is one of the best I have found.

  body: I like [[http://www.keithsmithbooks.com/|Keith Smith's books]]. There are
    lots of them but they all demonstrate lots of techniques (the Non-Adhesive Binding
    series, at least). I find them very inspiring.

    and Hudson Manual of Bookbinding]], which is serious & detailed, assuming you're
    <em>not</em> after artsy-craftsy bookbinding, but <em>proper</em> (ahem) stuff.

  body: <em>Proper</em> is relevant. Maybe the "proper" binding for a booklet is a
    French-folded folio with a 4-hole Japanese stab bind, because the booklet is about
    the history of Japanese prints? Or maybe it's a 2 inch thick journal and it needs
    a good ol' coptic stitch? :)
