  etc) electronically ? E.g. using Digital Postmarks and such.\r\n\r\nI just came
  across an idea of how to dramatically simplify the process and that made me wondering
  how many people have thought about doing that, but never did due to whatever reasons.
  It'd be also very interesting to know if anyone ever found themselves in a situation
  when having a timestamped work would've helped with resolving a dispute.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  care to share an opinion or an anecdote ? \r\n\r\nThanks"
