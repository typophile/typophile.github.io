  wandering north in a fierce southward river when it comes to my skills in typography.
  \r\n\r\nI wish to submit to all here for advice a font I recently found. I am a
  Classics major, and so have to deal with Polyphonic Greek as well as Latin. The
  font I have found is called GFS Didot, and am wondering what all of your opinion
  on this particular font is. What I mean is, what is its quality as a font, and what,
  if any, form of publication this font would be suitable for. \r\n\r\nI ask because
  I have grown to like *subtle* modern serifs, and this seems as such (think kind
  of like Kepler - Didone style but Old Style charm). My own personal problem with
  this is that the lowercase \"t\" is a bit too short for my taste, but that is venial.
  \r\n\r\nAlso, what fonts would work well in pairing with this, if it is suitable
  for publication uses?\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Futura and Helvetica (both sans) are some I've used in the past with Didot.\r\n\r\nBut
    seeing your examples a bit closer, yours is a very different version of what I've
    seen before.\r\n\r\nAs to what I (personally) think about Didot, for some reason
    I associate it with fashion magazines. Go figure\u2026 I see it as a very elegant/formal/serious
    typeface. And I love the contrast between roman and italics.\r\n\r\nHope it helps!"

  body: "Actually, this is not GFS Didot.\r\n\r\nGFS Didot is a Greek-only version
    made by George Matthiopoulos and based on scannings of Didot original work with
    Greek script. The font is freely [[http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces19th.html|available]]
    and has good quality.\r\n\r\nThe images you posted shows a font with several problems,
    built from different origins in a Didone style. Figures were taken from GFS Didot.
    Latin uppercase glyphs present in Greek alphabet seem to be modified versions
    of GFS Didot. S is a badly modified Palatino glyph. Ampersand is completely non-Didone.
    And lowercase is a low-quality mix, with contrast and stress not Modern at all.
    You are right about t: it is really too short.\r\n\r\nIt seems someone took GFS
    Didot and tried to add Latin script to it. But the result is not good.\r\n\r\nI
    like to combine Didones with grotesques and neogrotesques, especially condensed
    cuts. Modern fonts became firmly associated with fashion and women-related publications
    because Vogue established a standard on this many decades ago. Health and tourism
    publications also use to adopt Didones.\r\n\r\nYou can find several quality versions
    of Didot and Bodoni, not to mention other Modern variants, like Scotch."
