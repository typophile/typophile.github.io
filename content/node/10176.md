    target="_blank">ITC Kendo</a>. It also has decorative initials, not shown in the
    Test drive.

  body: I entered a poster in a contest for the Calgary Dragon Boat Festival a couple
    of years ago - I used <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/john-handy/john-handy/testdrive.html?s=DRAGON+BOAT&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">John Handy</a> for the headline. They didn&#39;t use my entry,
    but the next year, they cropped out the graphic and set the headline in <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=takeout&amp;page=&amp;nb_ppp_old=10&amp;text=DRAGON+BOAT&amp;nb_ppp=10&amp;classt=alpha">one
    of those god awful Chinese fonts</a> that border on racist. I never even got paid
    for the use of my graphic. <BR> <BR>Hmm... I don&#39;t really know where I was
    going with this. I guess it&#39;s good to see the use of some better brush scripts
    than Takeout for Asian cultural events. <BR> <BR> - Lex
