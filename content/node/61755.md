body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am interested to know if anyone can identify this typeface?
  \ It should be quite easy, I just cannot seem to find it online anywhere.  I'm sure
  this will be an easy one\u2026\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iso50-g-giveaway-101_4174.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I've not used extended fonts ever, and wondered what are a few good ones to use?
  \ More importantly, are there any good ones stored away in my default typefaces
  somewhere (I'm a Mac user with CS3).  Any help you could give would be very much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nNat"

    Extended and Univers 53, 63, 73, 93 (both a bit obvious, I expect someone else
    will suggest more interesting examples).'

  body: "Hmm\u2026 Akzidenz-Grotesk Extended is almost there.  Unfortunately the terminal
    of the G doesn't quite lie parallel to the crossbar, like it looks like it does
    in this example.  It is quite small though, so maybe it is.\r\n\r\nBeing a poor
    graduate, I have been buying Univers in stages as I've got the money, so I only
    have 6 fonts so far (not got as far as the Extended fonts!)\r\n\r\nHelvetica could
    be a good one though.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nNat"
