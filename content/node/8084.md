body: 'Lately, I have been a bit frustrated with my type design ideas and it&#39;s
  something I believe everyone in this forum faces from time to time  so I don&#39;t
  feel so bad. <BR> <BR>Recently a fellow Typophile called my latest &#39;entry&#39;
  for critique as having a &#39;me too&#39; kind of feel. I agree 100% with this person&#39;s
  comment so I didn&#39;t take it as a &#39;sign&#39; that I should quit or anything
  like that &#40;besides, i&#39;m certain he at no point suggested I should do such
  a thing&#41;. <BR>I guess I realized I needed to &#39;open up&#39; and experiment
  a little more. So i&#39;m trying to do just that . <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;ve always
  thought of this forum as a way of calibrating my technique as a designer and as
  a typographer. So I submit this letter &#39;n&#39; I&#39;ve been working on in hopes
  of finding out wether my idea is sound or am I going a bit overboard. Sometimes
  I &#39;fall in love&#34; with a particular glyph and don&#39;t know when to stop.
  <BR> <BR>Your input would be greatly appreciated <BR>IM <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: I think this has a lot of character, and potential to be a really interesting
    face. I think it&#39;s general structure is sound, but the details you&#39;ve
    carefully drawn make it interesting and unique. I would suggest you dive into
    it and see what happens, how the face might function, if there are interesting
    ways to build it to fit a purpose. <BR> <BR>Rock it <BR> <BR>Aaron

  body: 'Very interesting glyph. I think you should question yourself  what it is
    going to be used for: display or text? From this decision start developing the
    other characters. <BR>At the moment it is quite condensed so it might be good
    for headlines. <BR> <BR>Keep at it'
