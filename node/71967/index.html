  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am working on my first typeface and would like a bit of advice. I started with the lower case letters and am fairly happy unity of the set. I am having a bit of trouble, however, with the capital letters. Applying the curvy aesthetic of the lower case letters to the upper case is a stretch at times and it makes many of the letters look awkward.

I am curious as to the process of some more experienced type designers. Do you start a design with both upper and lower case in mind?  What are some tricks you use to balance the two? 

Any general comments on the typeface would be greatly appreciated as well. Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Basically you're getting tunnel vision about the distinguishing characteristics of your typeface. No typeface succeeds with only one salient feature; there are always multiple elements working together. Your lowercase k does fine without being shaped like an egg, so there is no reason to try to force your capital K into the shape of an egg. If you set "Hello", there is a reason the ells look much better than the H. Sometimes you have to give the recognizable features of a letter priority over those of the typeface. Use straight lines wherever they are appropriate, and you will find that in context they won't be as out of place as you expect.

At the same time, you can seek commonly accepted alternatives that let you work in the signature shape without compromise: an A can be round on top; an E can be shaped like a C with a crossbar; M and N can take the forms of a giant m and n.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You could want to reduce or accentuate the comic book feeling.
That said, I’m not sure the crossbar of A is working. Also B, V, W and Z could be revised.
But I love X and Y!</div>
