  of warning now about the aalt feature:\r\n[WARNING] <Longhand-Plain> feature 'liga',
  referenced in aalt feature, either is not defined or had no rules which could be
  included in the aalt feature.\r\nIt still compiles, but has something changed about
  this feature?"

  body: Nothing has changed about this feature. The new FDK version build in FontLab
    now tells you that it makes no sense to include features with ligature lookups
    in order to build a feature with a 'select one from many' lookup. The old FDK
    has ignored it silently.
