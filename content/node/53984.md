  Bauhaus and seems a bit too old fashioned. Does anyone have any suggestions on what
  typeface I could use which is similar to Bauhaus?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance..\r\n-mike"

  body: What's the business about? That might make it easier to get suggestions. Maybe
    something geometric, like Futura or Avenir? Avant Garde is very constructed, but
    less wierd then Bauhaus.
