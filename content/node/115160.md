  body: "Hi Bob, I believe you probably have it. The unusual ampersand matches. The
    HPLHS fonts are very poor quality -- designed as prop fonts for the Lovecraft
    Society games -- but this one could be expanded to be a fair match for the lettering.
    Indeed this may be where the poster makers obtained the letters.\r\nThe HPLS headline
    font is from a 1920s newspaper. All I know is that I didn't spot it  in the 1923
    ATF specimen book. \r\nDon"

  body: You were right about these being very poor quality fonts. The original designer
    also extended to 150%, and that's why it didn't match perfectly. Thanks again!

  body: "If you like the ampersand, and are prepared to use a narrower headline font
    of slightly different design, I have a couple of suggestions. Toronto Gothic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/toronto-gothic/
    Still has rounded corners and irregular lines that are meant to make it look worn
    from years of use, but much better made than the HPLS prop font.\r\nNewsflash
