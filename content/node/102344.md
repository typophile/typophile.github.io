body: Does anyone know any typefaces that would have been used in correlation with
  the Gustavian design style from 18th century Sweden? I am a graphic design student
  working on a design project and am having trouble tracking anything down. More broadly,
  anything with Neo-Classical influence that was prevalent in 18th century Scandinavia
  would also be relevant. I would appreciate any insights!
