body: 'As one might expect, the design of Gregory Maguire&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060987103/bsleeper"><i>Wicked:
  The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</i></a> is quite playful and
  Oz-like. <BR> <BR>In the hardcover and trade paperback editions, the text itself
  is set in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/truesdell/">Truesdell</a>,
  but I&#39;ve had a harder time than I expected identifying the face used for the
  chapter titling and cover design. Neither Identifont nor WhatTheFont came close,
  which surprises me, given the distinctive letterforms. Maybe they&#39;re too distinctive?
  FWIW, the &#34;R&#34; and &#34;K&#34; remind me of the New Yorker&#39;s iconographic
  logotype, and the &#34;Y&#34; is HTF Requiem-like. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Brent <BR>

  body: I absolutely love this typeface. Were I to name it, I&#39;d call it Olde Mischief.
