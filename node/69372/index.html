  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a freelance graphic designer. I was hoping if I could get a little advice on font licensing and such. I&rsquo;m keen to keep everything legit, but find it a little confusing.</p>
<p>Over the few years that I&rsquo;ve been working in the industry, I&rsquo;ve accumulated a lot of fonts - from other designers, clients, print houses etc. I understand that I can&rsquo;t legally use fonts that I do not own the license for, and that&rsquo;s absolutely fine. The problem is, I&rsquo;ve sorta lost track of which fonts I can/can&rsquo;t legally use.</p>
<p>Some time back, I was working on a client project that used a lot of Din Condensed. At the time, I had a copy of the font installed on my system, but had not yet purchased the license - I have no idea where I picked up the copy along the way. My intention was to keep working on the job using the (unlicensed) font and then buy a license before final delivery to the client.</p>
<p>The thing is I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find the font with the EXACT same name - &lsquo;DinCond&rsquo;. In the end, I opted to buy the nearest thing I could find, which was the &lsquo;Din OT Condensed&rsquo; family, and removed the original unlicensed version from my system.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m doubting myself a little now - for example: inDesign can&rsquo;t find the font I originally used because the name is slightly different, even though the set I bought <em>looks</em> identical.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does the licensed copy that I purchased cover me, even though the name itself is slightly different?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally speaking, what can happen if it turns out I&rsquo;ve used a font in the past that I didn&rsquo;t realise was unlicensed?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any advice would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Dee</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To answer your first question. It depends. There are more than one DIN out there, and they come from various resellers. Unless it was the exact same font — in this case if it were an OT update of the old font — you don’t own a license to the first font.</p>
<p>Btw, the dialog Indesign shows when you don’t have the correct font installed allows you to redfine all your styles using the old font in just a few clicks.</p>
<p><em>“… what can happen if it turns out I&rsquo;ve used a font in the past that I didn&rsquo;t realise was unlicensed?”</em>
There have been some cases of big corporations recieving lawsuits, but in most cases I’d guess the type designer would just ask you to license the font. I can’t really answer for others, and I’m not a professional anyway.
I don’t question your motives asking this question, but in general I think respecting the hard work of a fellow designer by not stealing it is just plain good for you, for the client, for the design industry and for the type designer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks a million for the reply. Regarding the Din font question - what you&rsquo;re saying makes perfect sense to me. The difficulty is I can&rsquo;t seem to actually find the exact same font so that I can buy it. Pretty frustrating, as I&rsquo;m perfectly happy to buy the license, but all I can find is variations! So in the interest of &lsquo;being legit&rsquo;, I figured it would be best to buy whatever I could. At least that way I &lsquo;tried&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I guess this type of thing is pretty common, huh? I know there are a lot of small-fry freelancers like me out there that don&rsquo;t pay much attention to font licensing.. at least in the early days. I guess as I start to earn more money from my work, I&rsquo;d like to gradually obtain licenses for anything I may have neglected in the past - it&rsquo;s just confusing with all the variations.</p>
<p>I mean, there seems to be dozens of different Helvetica. And I really have no idea how many of them I have used in previous jobs. Some legit; some almost certainly not. The font is just so ubiquitous - I swear I seem to accumulate different versions of it without even trying :)</p>
<p>Should I be worried about that type of thing, or would you say I am being overly cautious?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I wouldn’t worry about this sort of thing too much, it happens to everybody at some point. I find random commercial fonts on my system all the time with no clue where they came from, my best guess is that they were installed with software that didn’t clean up after itself when I got rid of it. You did make an effort to license something, that’s a lot more than most people do.</div>
