  body: "I have looked in all the books I have that might show this style, including
    a number of Dan Solo's books for Dover. There was a typeface called Atlas which
    is somewhat similar, but other than Bifur (also known as Matra) and Sinaloa there
    wasn't much else that was very similar. It's possible that they used an original
    (custom) design for that titling. All the shading lines are straight lines, so
    it may have been fairly easy to create.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I also looked in the Photo-Lettering catalogs I have and found a typeface
    called Niebolo Moonwalk, which is more like your sample, but still not identical.
    I am still leaning towards an original design, although I am sure my collection
    is not complete enough to be sure about that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
