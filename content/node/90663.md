body: hi, this is my first post, i really need to find the name of this font, it actually
  looks very familiar, i just found it on a Swedish website and it showed perfectly
  on my browser so i guess it must be quite popular. I really would like to use on
  my website as its very clean and thin, this is the website http://www.thesmileshop.se/.
  many thanks in advance.
