  just so I can freelance and do some work on along side my studies. I used to be
  an interface developer so mostly what I do is just \"PSD to XHTML\" or \"PSD to
  Wordpress\" work.\r\n\r\nFor the name of my company I'm using Calgary script. I
  wanted something that looked handmade as all my work is bespoke and handcrafted,
  and not using templates or dreamweaver etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I worked at a large agency,
  I only recall using Arial, Georiga, Tahoma and Verdana, the boring web-safe fonts.
  I've never been involved in print...\r\n\r\nSo my question is, should I have the
  same font for print (letterheads, invoices) as for the website? Or can I choose
  something more exiting for print?\r\n\r\nShould I have a mix of serif and sans serif
  on the website? What could go well with Calgary script?\r\n\r\nAny advise or links
  to relevant articles etc woukd be very much appreciated=)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLinda"

    want to explore non-web fonts for printed materials. You can then use an image
    of the logo on the website, until we finally get our act together to allow all
    fonts to be used effectively on the web.\r\n\r\nI would suggest a open, humanist
    sans serif with large x-height to complement Calgary Script.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"

    a different font, still sans serif though, that I really like. Trade gothic found
    here: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/\r\nIt might be a little
    bit harsh compared to Calgary but I'm just strangly attracted to it.\r\n\r\nBad
    idea or could it work?"

    some of the thinner weights would be a problem, but the bolds might stand up to
    Calgary. Make a sample of the work and see how it looks."

    of corporate training projects.\r\n\r\n@lindaS - why are you considering mixing
    your web and print type choices? For consistent branding, I'd use the same fonts
    across all mediums."

    and tahoma, which seems to be all websites come in these days (although I'm not
    a designer, I just do the xhtml/css/javascript/php...)\r\n\r\n@Bert Vanderveen
    -I think a script can work. If you have a look at Calgary script at http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/90,
    I think it it is fun, playful and would stand out among the normal corporate-y
    looks. \r\nI think making a website should be fun, for both the client and for
    me. I used to work in a big agency and for a lot of very, eh, boring clients.
    If candy script would scare them off then great.\r\nAnd it could work, take a
    look at Morphix for example http://www.morphix.si/#home\r\nAs I said, I wanted
    a script font because it looks human made rather than computer made. I handcode
    everything, I do not use templates. I want to emphasize this."

  body: "oh and @Don McCahill \r\nof course the best would be to just try it out,
    do a photoshop mockup and try some different combos. The only thing is... Since
    I'm not a desiger, I don't have  alot of fonts. I don't mind paying for the fonts
    that I'm going to use, but I don't want to spend all that money for then to find
    out that I'm not going to use the fonts... \r\n\r\nI'm probably being silly but
    I want to know I'm going to to use the font before purchasing it."
