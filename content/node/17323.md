  body: "Ellipsis traditionally have three dots in them, to indicate, as James suggests,
    a drifting off of a sentence. \r\n\r\n**IF the sentence ends with the ellipsis,
    then it should have four dots -- three for the ellipsis and one for the period
    at the end of the sentence.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the sentence is continued,
    then you'd have the ellipsis, a space, and then the continuation of the sentence
    like so:\r\n\r\nIs this... what you were asking?"
