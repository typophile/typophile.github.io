  I seem to have more faith in my mathematical skills than my optic senses. One thing
  I can't seem to figure out though is how to make a nice S (even in existing fonts
  I usually dislike the S-character the most)...\r\nAny suggestions on the \"scientific\"
  approach of the S would be much appreciated!"

    far more complicated than just providing it naturally.  Do a lot of drawing of
    the s and get inside of it.  You may have a better idea of what the mathmatital
    measurements you get are all about--you may even pass on the math :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    smooth connection (straight handles) equal length control vectors ?

  body: "Equal length of control vectors does not improve the geometric qualities
    of the spline, I am afraid. It seems to be one of the most widespread fallacies.\r\n\r\nIf
    your curve looks somehow wrong or discontinuous you almost always need to shift
    the position of the actual nodes. Fiddling about with the control points does
    not help.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "as a novice, my input may not be as valuable as those above... then again...\r\n\r\nThe
    Briem site is terrific. His advice to draw the damned thing again and again...\r\n\r\nand
    again...\r\n\r\nis right on. I must have drawn 20 esses before i got to one i
    was ready to settle on... at least until i get back to balancing weights and such.
    The following samples each have 10 bezier pts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_5367.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    they don't look much different to you, again, M. Briem has the right advice. sit.
    look at them. and then look at them some more. I take a printed page of chars
    with me when i ride to the beach every day. and look at them.\r\n\r\nOnce i got
    to where i like the basic shape, I removed the points  from the top and bottom
    of the bowls and from the mid stroke and added points to the outsides of the bowl
    strokes, resulting in 8 points which gave me better control of the weight and
    curvature. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s2_3412.jpg]\r\n\r\nof
    course, this is a pretty simple shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeo."

    of the left-right side of the black, thanks for the 'spline' term, and William
    Berkson, thank you for the link to the previous discussion with John Hudson\u2019s
    contribution, I also enjoy tech/creative English language skills very much."

  body: It's sooooo much easier with Cornu spirals, which have a smooth and natural
    "S" shape built-in. Crap, I just realized that I first posted about that on Typophile
    <a href="http://typophile.com/node/7099"> two freakin' years ago</a>, and still
    haven't gotten to the point where I can talk about my secret project openly. Ah
    well.
