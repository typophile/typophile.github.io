    live here for too long. However the pay is better than outside of London and there's
    always stuff to do and see. \r\n\r\nPlus its raining again...\r\n\r\nWhere would
    you be moving from? What area of design are you looking to move into?\r\n\r\nG"

  body: "Hey G,\r\n\r\nI'm coming from France.\r\nI'm looking for an art director
    / graphic designer position at a fashion magazine or a creative agency. I'm starting
    to have interesting offers but It's difficult for me to estimate what would be
    ideally my gross salary / annum.\r\nSo I'm starting to collect informations about
    other art directors / graphic designers income there.\r\n\r\nI wanna live in zone
    1 or zone 2 max. I have a daughter who'll have to go to the French Lyc\xE9e. What
    about health insurance ? do employers provide it there ?\r\n\r\nThanks again everybody
    for your support !"

  body: "well I'm a designer in my second year of design and my first at this magazine.
    Its a larger company (Natmags) than when I first started and so there are more
    benefits. My experience isn't very broad, but it seems the larger the company,
    the more perks/policies you get. I think they offer me life insurance and a pension,
    but we've got the NHS for health problems so no need for health insurance (not
    entirely true, the NHS does suck so it depends what quality of healthcare you
    want).\r\n\r\nI'm on about 21k a year which does me ok. But then I'm only a designer
    with limited experience. \r\n\r\nZone 1 will cost ya. But then you'll save on
    travel if you are within walking distance (and willing to do so) of your work.
    Oyster travelcards are not cheap to say the least (there are less polite words
    I could use to describe the London transport situation but this is a family restaurant...)\r\n\r\nI
    live at the edge of zone 2, in North Acton and it only takes me about half an
    hour to get to work at Oxford Circus on the central line.\r\n\r\nHope I've been
    of some help."
