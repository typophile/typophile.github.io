body: "This may be a simple question, but I can't find an answer anywhere, including
  at typophile. \r\nDoes anybody have a clue of what was the first metal <em>italic</em>
  (or in fact <em>slanted</em> sans serif font? \r\nMy guess from the material that
  I could look into would be something in a field where many different typefaces are
  needed in one composition: map printing or the like (on the other hand, maps were
  seldomly printed from lead letters apart from trials by Raffelsberger and others,
  but either engraved or later lithographically reproduced from ~1800 on). \r\nSo
  any clues that could point into the right direction? Akzidenz Grotesk?"

  body: "Whatever it was, it probably wasn't AG as AG was cobbled together from other
    grotesks purchased by H. Berthold A.G.. \r\n\r\nThe Berthold specimens from the
    1960s on <a href=\"http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/#BERTHOLD\">Uli's site</a>
    has italics (kursiv), these weights are not mentioned in the list of weights and
    releases up to 1958 published in <em>100 Jahre Berthold</em>, which suggests to
    me that either they were added by G.G. Lange when he redesigned AG in the late
    1950s or that they existed previously and nobody cared enough to list them in
    what writings and specimen books  survive. Either way Lange would probably know."

    lower case sans serif type I've come across in use, which also happens to be italic,
    and there is no instance of a matching roman lower case. It's from an advertising
    leaflet for the Liverpool & London & Globe Insurance Comapany, bound into The
    Sunday Magazine, Oct. 1874, printed in London by Virtue & Co.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Insurance_1874A_6230.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tontine_5396.jpg]"

      <em>Steinschrift Kursiv</em> (most likely, H.Berthold's). It's a truly cursive
      grotesque sans. Interesting, huh? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Steinschrift

  body: The Nymph and the Grot has quite a bit about the origins of the term Egyptian,
    and a reproduction of an 1834 Thorowgoood sans lower case, but no mention of italic
    sans serif.

  body: "Thanks everybody! Interesting sample that Nick Shinn posted \u2013 this is
    indeed an <em>italic</em>, not just a slanted variant as it seems to have become
    standard for \"prototypical\" sans serif or \"Grotesk\" fonts (i.e. not humanist
    sans). The uppercase looks more like a slanted roman as in \"LIFE DEPARTMENT\",
    though. \r\nI will keep looking and post what I can find. If anybody only had
    some more ideas where to look\u2026"

    were in signs before the advent of sans type. Wasn't Caslon's Egyptian based on
    letters he saw in signs?"

    after signwriters, lettering artists, architects, stonemasons and calligraphers
    had had their way with it.\r\n\r\n\"Phantom\" was one of the few display styles
    that were \"type first\", from the 1830s, because type founders used engineering

    genres which originate with type, one should look to text type, although even
