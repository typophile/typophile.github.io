body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Could anyone please share any advice with diagonal lines? They
  seem to thin out compared to the other lines, despite using the same width as the
  vertical lines. Is there a quantifiable approximation as to determining the optical
  thinning of the line? <BR> <BR>Mahalo!

    <BR> <BR><i>Could anyone please share any advice with diagonal lines? They seem

    lines.</i> <BR>When you slant them, yes they get thinner. When you rotate them,
    they actually get thicker. The above pdf shows the difference. The top excercise
    shows slanting, the bottom is rotational thickening. <BR> <BR>Have fun! <BR>Randy'
