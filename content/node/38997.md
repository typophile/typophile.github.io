body: So this is a new typeface I'm working on based on the supposed font choice of
  the Belshaw Donut Robot 42. It's the first monospace I've ever done and I'd really
  love some feedback as it's hard to find specific design information on the web.

  body: 'The O (oh) and 0 (zero) look virtually the same. Depending on what you''re
    intending it for this might be immaterial, but if you want people to be able to
    code with it, one of the glyphs needs something to distinguish it (like a center
    dot or a slash). Maybe as an OpenType alternate, as slashed zeros often are? '
