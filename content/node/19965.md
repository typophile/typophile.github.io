  than normal Caps, but larger than Smallcaps?\r\n\r\nI've read about them somewhere,
  but can't remember where. It said they can be used for terms like \"USA\" in texts,
  where Smallcaps would be too small and looking strange on abbrevations, but Caps
  be too large (especially in english fontdesigns with quite large Capitals).\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help\r\nSebastian (ex sebilar)"

    or script-dependent. You better have taller s.c. in Cyrillic. In the Russian edition
    of Bringhurst's <em><a href=\"http://community.livejournal.com/ru_typography/363193.html\">Elements
    of typographic style</em></a> (it's just off the press) Dmitry Aronov, the publisher
    and the compositor of the translated version, had to use s.c. in a slightly larger
    size (9.3 pt.) than the surrounding text (9.0 pt.), to make them work. The typeface
    used in the Russian edition is ITC Charter.\r\n\r\nIn the new version of his typeface
    Bilss (<a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/blisspro.htm\">Bliss Pro</a>)
    Jeremy Tankard has revised the height of the small caps. They are significantly
    taller than in the <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/bliss.htm\">original
    version</a> of 1996. The reason is, Bliss Pro now has a Cyrillic version (along
    with Latin and Greek).\r\n\r\nIn the multilingual <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/resources/design/ClearType.html\">ClearType
    font collection</a>, put together for Microsoft by an international team of type
    designers, the relationship of the cap-height, x-height and s.c.-height in all
    constituent typefaces was thorougly discussed among the participants, and co-ordinated
    across all design and language versions."
