  thing is I'd like to make silk screen prints, only thing is i have never made a
  pdf file that's good to go and send to the guy who's actually going to do the silk
  screen printing.\r\n\r\nThe design is made up out of green, red, black and yellow.\r\n\r\nDoes
  every color need its own pdf file?\r\n\r\nWould be really nice if someone could
  point out on how to save a file for silk screen printing with multiple colors\r\n\r\nthnx
  guys!  "

    separation themselves, not too sure about this guy you're talking about.\r\n\r\nBut
    yeah, it's always a good idea to speak with the service provider and nail down
    the artwork specifications."

    screen printers require positives to make their films, but it is critical you
    speak with the printer directly. Perhaps the best way to manage it is to send
    native files. \r\n\r\nAnd remember, Spot Colors only."

  body: Yeah always ask the printer. Sometimes what they ask for will surprise you.
    I've put lots of extra work into preparing files for print, only to have the printer
    tell me it wasn't necessary after all.
