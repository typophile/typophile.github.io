  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So the very first time I submitted to Print I got into the Print Design Annual.

It was really great since that is my favorite design contest out there. However I have been submitting every year since and have not made it in again. So now they have raised their prices and I have lost a bit of my confidence...

so my question is are design contests worth the money to submit and how can one tell when something is worth submitting?

thanks!</div>

So it's not the celebrity whim format used in the design world, more of a rank and file thing.
That much at least keeps it real, although the campaigns targeting Academy members, and the awards night hoopla are a bit over the top.</div>

You can tell that contests like the Oscars and many design ones suck simply by looking at the results: they suck.

Actually, good design judges actually exist, and some
organizations manage to select them for their contests.

I generally feel weird about contests and whatnot but Jakes has a great point about employers and resumes and whatnot. I think it was at the AGI student conference this past Spring where the panel was giving us advice about winning contests:
<ul> <li>make it big, if it's printed and huge, it dwarfs everything when they're all laid out on the tables.</li>
<li>make it quickly/simply understood.</li>
<li>no complicated folding.. the first judge going through the work will unfold it and wont care to fold it back up.</li></ul>

Most of this is pretty life-coachy, but #26 is a good one.

I don't really follow this rule 100%, though -- I enter in free contests, because there's nothing to lose except a little bit of time. Most of these are books, which will stay on the shelf a lot longer than a magazine, too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@jakes: totally agree. in school, you get a lot of info about how to impress art/creative directors. What you don't learn is you're lucky if you get to deal with a creative director, and a lot of times you're dealing with some MBA clown who can only see "oh, they must be good, they worked on Coke and Nike, and have won a bunch of awards." And often times "creative" directors are the same way, as this [[http://businessguysonbusinesstrips.com/art/hiring.jpg|cartoon points out.]] It's nice when you deal with someone who can recognize great concepts and executions in a project for a small non-profit as much as they can for a big global company, but this is not always the case.</div>

That said, now that I'm on my own I never enter these things. It's a lot of money. I also think (at least with AIGA) that if you don't participate and schmooze you don't win prizes. Sorry, but it feels like an old boys club to me. Again, I'm not paying their exorbitant membership fees now that I no longer have a company buying it for me.</div>

That said, now that I'm on my own I never enter these things. It's a lot of money. I also think (at least with AIGA) that if you don't participate and schmooze you don't win prizes. Sorry, but it feels like an old boys club to me. Again, I'm not paying their exorbitant membership fees now that I no longer have a company buying it for me.

FeeltheKern: the answer is never. Ever.</div>

I can't picture a lot of people <em>actively shunning</em> competition results.

In my case, two that I know of (and probably more that I don't).

Besides getting projects, it can also help in being accepted as a conference speaker (if only because somebody who has won awards makes the conference look better) which is of course yet another way to promote yourself and get more work.

The trick I think isn't to shun contests, it's to
not get duped by lame ones that charge too much.

However I have been wondering lately since I am about 8 yrs out of school how can I find a mentor who can help me reach for excellence? Any ideas? I really wish I could find someone that I respect to give me regular crits.

		<div class="commentbody">@Hrant: Thanks for the reply, I think that affirmed a lot of my assumptions. Sometimes I think designers shun contests because by nature we have an extra dose of ego, so when we don't get our work validated in a contest we assume that there must be something intrinsically wrong with the system. That said, I have come across many that are way overpriced and definitely seem like an old boy's club, where the same 5 firms take home all the awards.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Awe this is the cutest post ever.
Seriously though I think that when designing something for a practical application or use there is great reward in seeing the design being used and appreciated over long term.
The exposure from winning contests is super. At this point in my career just seeing the satisfaction on a client's face once Ive given them something they appreciate is enough for me. Even encountering a piece of my portfolio in it's intended use years after designing it is satisfaction enough. I often feel like I've won an award just knowing people like and use my work. It is wonderful how my pieces show up in odd places and not a soul in the room can identify the connection between me and the design.
It is delightful like being the writer of a book with a secret alias.
