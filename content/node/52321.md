  body: "Hi Tony,\r\n\r\nDid you try playing with the uppercase of these two letters,
    it could be more successful. The uppercase N and H have a similar form and could
    be played with without the llama effect happening.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to
    keep the serif on the lowercase n and remove it from the ascender on the h part.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!\r\nDiane"

  body: "If this looks like a lama...\r\n\r\nYou have a good concept here, it is creative
    and does exactly what it needs to, I'm sure the main issue with the client is
    that she is expecting a mono using a script wedding face, which will not work
    with this concept. I think you could try a few different faces as well as Will's
    idea to finesse out the cut creating a more styled 'n' and 'h'. I do think you
    need a face that has a visual tie in the 'h' character so when you do make the
    split the pieces still look part of the same realm.\r\n\r\nOf course, as a married
    person, this concept could be crushed the minute someone say it represents a break
    up not a union.\r\n\r\n-titz"

  body: "titz is right on in my opinion. the letters should be making sweet type love
    and not be disconnected a bit. the implications of such a break up could be disastrous.
    Good idea w/ the uppercase letters (Diane) but I like the hairline serifs for
    the font. This is just to spark some ideas...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HN_4740.png]"

    more than the disconnected aspect

    here is your idea refined. It works beautifully in 2 colors but does not work
    in BW so well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nh_monogram_4188.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    am revisiting my original idea in an italic version.\r\nIt still looks a bit bland.
    I am going to try to enclose it in an ornate shape.\r\n\r\ni'll just keep playing
    with it. Thanks again everyone.\r\n\r\nWHURD!\r\n\r\n"
