  fear I'm being too critical of my work, so I figured what better place to have people
  critique it then here.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone thing of this? Are the fonts too
  busy? I feel like the entire thing is rather dense, but like i said before, maybe

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI think the whole piece has a pretty vintage 1900's kind of feel
    to it, which is cool. Was this your intention? I think the calligraphy looks pretty
    good (although I get strong Coca-Cola feelings with it, but maybe that's just
    me). I think the word 'brand' is not in the right place, it feels like an afterthought
    to the calligraphy. I think you should try to integrate it more with the calligraphy.
    The 'designs...' texts could be moved a bit further away from the calligraphy.
    Give it a bit more air. And you might want to look into the colors a bit, as I
    feel they are not completely matching.\r\n\r\nGood luck! \r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

    look, and I agree it does have a little bit of a Coca-Cola feeling which I tried
    to avoid with the colors and skewing. I definitely agree with you on the placement
    of 'brand' and 'designs.' I think giving it more air, as you say, will help lighten
    it up a bit.\r\n\r\nR//R\r\nhttp://web.me.com/kyleleitch"

    definitely has a very old-timey look to it. If that's not the kind of work you're
    going to be pursuing or doing, yu might want to consider another approach.\r\n\r\nFor
    me, the treatments on the two fonts don't work well together. You name has a simple
    (green?) drop shadow behind it, and the rest has a very modern (or maybe more
    like 1990s) 3D feel to it. I think if you could give the same treatment to both
    of them, it would be a lot more cohesive.\r\n\r\nThe red in your name doesn't
    pop well on the black background. Maybe try brightening that up?"

    script looks like it's been squashed and stretched; frankly, VERY tortured. Skewing
    and distorting text is <strong>the</strong> mark of an amateur. \r\n\r\nThe contrast
    is uneven and the yellow-ish outline makes it worse. The angle of stress is inconsistent;
    most glaring in the arm on the K and the whole swash underneath. The perspective
    on the swash is totally out-of-sync with the lettering, making the wide left side
    look like it's reaching out directly at me, and the Kyle is a few feet behind
    it. Look at some videos on YouTube about how to write calligraphy, then pay close
    attention to natural the angle of stress and contrast.\r\n\r\nThe colors don't
    bother me, but the background gradient doesn't match the era. The green shadow
    is just odd.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but I'm starting to feel mean. I hope I helped
    without hurting your feelings!"

    the smaller type would be better suited set in a similar color.\r\n\r\nOther than

    now, its cliche -- I cant count how many brands, shirts, logos, or products use
    the exact same styling, and that just works against you. You're not designing
    a cool t-shirt, you're trying to create a corporate (or personal) identity - remember

    on the right track with the classic typefaces for the description and contact

    definitely up the quality of the lettering (i.e., don't simply skew a font).\r\n\r\nI
    would consider going back to the conceptual stage of your branding process. A
    specific mark or font is secondary to what you convey with your presentation as
    a whole.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the list of things to convey should -- in my opinion
    -- be technical proficiency. So I think it would be better to simply use a standard
    font like Helvetica with the right size and spacing. Of course, my immediate follow-up
    advice would be to, if possible, convey some personality (which might rule out
    Helvetica).\r\n\r\nBut proficiency should always come before originality. That
    is, if you want to make $$."
