body: What type size would you suggest using for the captions in a photography magazine?
  I'm a Graphic Design student. I'm using Neutra Text. I've been trying with 8 pt
  because anything else seems way too small, but it still feels dense on the page.

  body: "There can be many reasons why the text feels dense on the page, but size*
    is not the only factor. For one thing, you have to see it in print (if that\u2019s
    the end product) to judge how the type really works because the rasterized image
    on a screen is influence by many factors that don\u2019t apply in print. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not familiar with Neutra Text, but a couple of things that\u2019s worth looking
    at if things feel too dense is the leading (line spacing), the tracking (letter
    spacing) and the weight (perhaps try a light?). I advice against pushing the tracking
    too far, because the space inside and around letters are drawn to balance each
    other. If Neutra still feels too tight, perhaps you should look for another face.\r\n\r\n*Although
    increasing size means increasing weight."

    term, see paragraph styles/justification) helps also.

    is by adjusting the letterspacing. Another thing to consider is whether you\u2018d
    use U&lc or All Caps. The latter makes for a better experience in most cases,
    IMO."
