body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI need your help. I've got this excel file with thousands of
  lines that I need to transport to a pretty table in InDesign. So far so good, copy
  paste does the trick. The problem is: there are some products that have multiple
  codes in it and copy/pasting it to ID creates multiple rows instead of a single
  row followed by \"child\" rows.\r\n\r\nI've attached an image to clarify what I
  just tried to explain.\r\n\r\nBasically I need to be able to import the Excel table
  (exactly as it is) to InDesign.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThank you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/illustration_01_6069.jpg]"

    > Place, and when it asks you to select the file to import be sure that the \"Show
    Import Options\" checkbox is checked. InDesign's Help files explain what the various
    options do."
