body: I'm stumped. I have to design a website and some other stuff for homecoming
  this year, but I can't identify the font. I've attached the logo. Do you think there
  are subcaps in it? Anyone know the font for the top part and the bottom part (if
  you know of a font that encompasses the 3D look, great!). Thanks!
