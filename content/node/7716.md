    online game that was used to promote Halo 2? I don&#39;t play Halo, but one of
    my best friends wrote the online promo game. <BR> <BR>T

    Mac...or PC if I&#39;m desperate. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t see how people can play
    Halo with a controller anyway...give me a mouse and keyboard any day.

  body: When I was at high school I really liked to play Age of Empires, nothing as
    the war horn soud, but I had to leave games of any kind, I wasted too much time
    on them.

  body: How do you find the new nostramo, Vincent? I had the earlier version on my
    Mac for playing Quake III but I found my fingers too large and I kept messing
    up on the side joystick. <BR> <BR>Oh... and any Quake III players out there or
    am I painfully unfashionable in my choice of game?

  body: David, I&#39;m still hoping someone will retool the code for Carmageddon,
    the ultra violent driving game. Loved that back in the days of OS 8 and 9. Now
    I just stick to Unreal Tournament 2004. But I did play Quake quite a bit, too.

  body: I bought the nostramo 52 from dabs.co.uk <BR> <BR>I like sports games most
    Cricket 2004, NHL 2004, then TombRaider is a retro fave, then Doom 3 and Halo.
    find sports games best with the playstation one. maybe it&#39;s just me.

    Kral and I worked at Bigwords.com, it was the multiplayer of choice after work.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve been playing Counter-Strike almost exclusively lately. The Source
    version is extremely fun with it&#39;s amazing physics engine. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not much of a Halo fan &#40;Don&#39;t have an xbox&#41; but I have played through
    Half-Life 2 three times now. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    time had to be Myth &#40;no, not Myst!&#41;. That  <BR>was the best multiplayer
    game ever built. &#40;Ahem, also by Bungie,  <BR>the chieftains behind Marathon
    and Halo.&#41;

  body: I am so jealous of you all. I desperately wish I was playing all these games.
    Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have much self-control when it comes to video games,
    so I would never stop and I might have to drop out of school. <BR>However, I am
    graduating in a couple of months
