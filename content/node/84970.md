body: "I did release Van den Velde Script, my new calligraphic (more or less) font.
  The work was hard, but more easy than Penabico, because some things which I learn
  when build Penabico. \r\n\r\nThe font is here\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/van-den-velde-script/\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I appreciate critics, which will be used to increase the font, with possible updates.\r\n\r\nall
  the best for all\r\n\r\nPaulo W\r\nIntellecta Design"
