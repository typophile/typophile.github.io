  body: "Do you need to know the names so you can further research them?\r\nOr do
    you need us to supply you answers to an assignment?\r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to ID
    any of these outright because I suspect you might just be looking for name/foundry
    and I don't think many in the Typophile community want to do your homework. I
    know I don't. Besides, what is the fun in just being told?\r\n\r\nThat said, I
    highly recommend the [[http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/|What the Font]] tool
    at MyFonts.com. The whole site of MyFonts would help you track these down by searching
    through similar looking typefaces. Try searching broad categories (geometric,
    slab serif, etc.) and narrow your searches from there.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are
    at least two images in there that I feel any new graphic design student should
    probably know. You have at least heard of Helvetica and Futura, yes?\r\n\r\nSorry
    if that sounded harsh. Good luck, and believe me when I say the process of researching
    all of those will be more rewarding than having us feed you answers."
