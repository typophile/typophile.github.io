body: "Hi \r\n\r\nI've been handed a copy of InDesign and a document to modify. I'm
  unfamiliar with both the software and the document.\r\n\r\nWhat I can quickly see
  is desperately needed to to take the 85 page document and align all the text boxes.
  \r\n\r\nIm sure there is a simple way to do this, but for now Im going from page
  to page changing the x, y W and H variables ... for the left facing pages and the
  right facing ones.\r\n\r\nPlease can someone tell me how to do this to all text
  boxes, there is one txt box per page, rather than individually\r\n\r\nTo clarify...\r\nI
  need all left facing pages to be set at \r\nx 4,1666 in y 5,625 in w 6,4761 in h
  9,3333 in\r\nall left facing pages should be at \r\nx 13,1547 y 5,4583  w 6,4761
  h 9,3333 in \r\n\r\nThere is apparently one other document that will need these
  changes and I have no desire to do this 170 times!\r\n\r\nThanks so much\r\n\r\nYvonne"

    them there?

  body: "Ralf,\r\nI checked there first. There aren't any text boxes set up there,
    just graphic boxes.\r\n\r\nSince these boxes are alright in the document itself,
    might there be another way to get there all to a uniform size?\r\n\r\nYvonne"

  body: If you're lucky, the existing text boxes are aligned to the documents' Margins
    settings. You can see that by moving or resizing one of the text boxes; were they
    aligned to deep purple lines? If so, you can change <em>all</em> of 'em in a single
    go! See Layout Adjustment in the Help.

  body: 'Not sure if there is a way left to do it with one click, but you certainly
    don''t have to enter all the values on each page. Just make it once (with the
    Move palette) and the just use the shortcut for Redo Transformation on the following
    pages. You might even select many text frames at once if you zoom out enough and
    change them with the shortcut. '

  body: "Yvonne,\r\n\r\nI think Ralph means,\r\n1) Use the <strong>Move...</strong>
    command (found in menu Object > Transform > Move...)\r\n2) Use the <strong>Transform
    Again</strong> command (found in menu Object > Transform Again > Transform Again)\r\n\r\nThe
    above assumes that you're using InDesign CS3."
