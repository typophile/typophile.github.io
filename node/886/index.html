Progress, progress, progress. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll admit, I have not been around here forever.

It would take to much time and I must make a living. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do however, perhaps more than anyone else's, follow  Hrant's posts. I find the discussions he participates in to be, more often than not, learning experiences. For that I am grateful. And for the most part (I've been around about a year now I think)  I have not seen Hrant attack anyone who did not deserve it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In fact, many times, it seems as if a few have logged on for the purpose of attacking him. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I feel that if anyone has been inappropriate around here, in proportion to the total number of times they have posted, it would be  .  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, Hrant, I would think that enough of the people around here would indeed know you well enough ( even on a forum ) not to be so offended by some of the things you say. It seems, according to your accusers, that you say these things often enough that they would carry little weight by now. But obviously you are respected.

		<div class="commentbody">I've applied my own rigorous 72 hour rule for this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reply. If you read any of this at all, please read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whole thing so I'm not misunderstood. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope I can say this once and get it off my chest <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forever. More than that I hope Hrant doesn't respond. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've written drafts of this letter many times over the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->span of my involvement here; some for Hrant in private, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some for the public. Most sat forever, unposted. One or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two got sent to him privately as formal censures, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wait; Jared got to write those. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've never commented publicly, mainly because I didn't <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think Hrant would take it as helpful criticism and also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->because I thought posting it online would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inappropriate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In some ways I'm posting this in hopes we can move on. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other ways, I'm really hoping Hrant is listening for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his sake and ours (so he can help us move on). I'm also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tempted to link to two-year old posts so some of you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new folks can see what all the fuss is about, and that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant has come a long way, but the archives have saved <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me the effort and spared us all the past. A past that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hopefully we can all laugh about later. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lastly, I won't speak as a moderator/partner here. It's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just me. Hrant hasn't asked for this thread, nor does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he deserve more air time (or scolding for that matter), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but in so many ways he has been asking for it for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very long time and rightfully deserves a lengthy public <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scolding in the form of a roast from someone who likes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to think he cares. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I could just second most of what Jon Coltz and all of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what John Hudson wrote and sit down. I could just agree <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with anonymous, that Hrant is a tedious, insufferable <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bigot. I do think I have a different perspective to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->offer and hopefully it can be taken constructively by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant and his detractors. (Besides, John's British <!-- raw HTML omitted -->roots betrayed him; he was way too polite for Hrant to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actually see the critique. =) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll be as blunt as Hrant seems to prefer and I'm going <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to try to be candid and also fair. Hrant needs to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->change, frankly in ways I'm skeptical are possible. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type community, including myself, needs to change: to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->consider Hrant for what he is now, and move on. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only caveat is, I've never met him. I don't read every <!-- raw HTML omitted -->single post here (or elsewhere) so I don't consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->myself privy to everything he says or did in his past <!-- raw HTML omitted -->life. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On to the letter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->_________________________ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In some ways I agree. In other ways Hrant angers me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beyond words. Thanks for giving me a platform for my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vent and call to action. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've heard too many people, whom I respect and whose <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experience I would love to hear from more, say he's the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reason they don't post more. That's a shame. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I believe he's becoming sufficiently *ignorable for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->those who find him insufferable. (I'll elaborate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->later.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like Yves, I too believe Hrant's not a bad guy, I know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he's had a legal run-in with a major foundry in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->past which, to my 3rd-hand knowledge is resolved and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forgiven by all parties (if I'm wrong someone will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->correct me within the hour) and is deeper than being <!-- raw HTML omitted -->removed from any online discussion, but not so deep <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that the type community should hang him out to dry. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don't fully know the details, nor should we care, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unless they are pertinent or threatening or affect us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personally. I even believe, if one are sincere and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant sensed that sincerity, he'd probably tell about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it. Finally, from what I can tell, Hrant never holds a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->grudge. Okay, so I shouldn't say never, but at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when he holds a grudge you'll know about it. For these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reasons I no longer question his motives, only his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->approach. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's the past baggage,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that's Hrant pre 2001-2002 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I sincerely hope). Let's move on already and hope <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant can help us tolerate him more with my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simple-Action Reckoning and Carefree Approach to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Symbiosis Method outlined below. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On to the present baggage.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Yes, this is for those <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of you intolerant of hhp. He's become more ignorable in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the past year. He's more willing to admit wrong or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->listen to another view. Sometimes, though, when I can't <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bear it, I still have to post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->around<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Hrant by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->picking up a thread at a point before he got to it. For <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the most part this works, but honestly, Hrant is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better man than some of you grudgingly hold. Even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->though he's still an insufferable tedious bigot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mr. Papazian's online wanderings would be more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fruitful to him and others if he found better focus.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Were his postings more targeted and less haphazard he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could focus on mutual understanding and less time <!-- raw HTML omitted -->responding to every thread, everywhere. (Does Hrant go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->home at night and check off a list off all the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->perceived wrongs he righted?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seriously, Hrant should use his online time (is he ever <!-- raw HTML omitted -->off-line?) to pick a few key discussions and really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->explore them, rather than his current method of reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->every thread and taking a shotgun-blast approach to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->leaving quick comments in each one. When Hrant agrees <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with a thread, these quick comments are cheapened by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their quantity like showering too many compliments. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, when he disagrees, these quick comments come <!-- raw HTML omitted -->off as blanket statements wherein he endicts entire <!-- raw HTML omitted -->industries, classes of people, organizations and entire <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nations. They are antagonizing and, by their quick <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nature, unproductive and take away from the times when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he's caught being helpful or kind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant has to help us like him better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> In your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->letter Jon, you assert that others don't post because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they're afraid. That may be so, for a minority. Most <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just see that it's fruitless to engage in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conversation with someone who just wants to antagonize; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->someone who just argues, and seemingly not for the sake <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of disagreement, but for the savor of being <!-- raw HTML omitted -->disagreeable. If that keeps someone with real-world <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experience &ndash; as opposed to being well read or even the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most verbose &ndash; away from online forums, that's a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shame. (Unfortunately the 'fruitful avoidance' thing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only seems to work in hallways and lecture halls.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This isn't the 4th grade where we get an S if we play <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nicely or a U if we don't. Unfortunately, in the past, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant has given people plenty of reasons to not like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->him. Some people just want more reasons to like Hrant. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some of these will never be satisfied and that's okay, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and it's probably okay with Hrant too. Afterall, he's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never sought anybody's approval. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I already responded to Hrant's comment about tolerance. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll elaborate since it suits the structure of my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->letter. On August 11, 9:25am, he wrote: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We come from different environments, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->naturally civility has different measures for you and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me&hellip; The only thing you should try to enforce is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tolerance&hellip; It really is a matter of spine, which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->translates to self-control. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even though Hrant can be insulting, he may be the most <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tolerant of us as people. Afterall, he chooses to live <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in America, a land he loathes, among mostly Christians <!-- raw HTML omitted -->who he deems worse than nazis, in LA of all places, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ideological capital of all things decadent, fat and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SUV-driving. Phew, now that's tolerant! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He's certainly not the most tolerant of ideas, however. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->His tolerance argument sounds good if it's coming from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mr. Bowfry (ahem, back in the 4th grade). If Hrant were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the picked-on kid who was always nice, but still had no <!-- raw HTML omitted -->friends, we'd be inclined to agree with his view of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tolerance and have empathy. Or at least, he'd be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chick magnet with the 6th grade girls.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure if I should congratulate Hrant on growing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a stiff spine or if I should challenge him to now grow <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some manners ('Western' or what he calls'traditional' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd take either one. He is essentially saying, &quot;if you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can't tolerate my abrasiveness, then you're intolerant, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and that's your fault, not mine.&quot; That's Hrant's excuse <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for not taking the time or effort to articulate what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he's thinking. Honesty doesn't have to be rude and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blunt is not the same as brash. If Hrant were really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trying to have a conversation or productive dialogue <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he'd strive to communicate and be understood rather <!-- raw HTML omitted -->than aiming to offend. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I'll try to tone down my digs &ndash; some friendly, all <!-- raw HTML omitted -->critical. Truthfully, when he takes the effort to stay <!-- raw HTML omitted -->through an argument, the harsh points, the brazen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->attitude and caustic shards are broken off in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tussle and the result is a mishappen but recognizalbe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nugget that many seem to agree on.

The example you give is phrased as a personal attack because you aledge personal failings in the person involved. You can make the same point about the substance of the debate without getting personal.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, you could say, &quot;Taking calligraphy as a model rules out valuable improvements such as trapping.&quot; I don't know what you meant to say on the substance, but if you have a point to make about the type design issue, it is always in principle possible to do it without getting personal. (Assuming of course it is not a personal issue to start with, such as piracy.) Shifting to the personal - the 'ad hominem' attack - is unnecessary, and damages rather than furthering the search for truth.</div>
