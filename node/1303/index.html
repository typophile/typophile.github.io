<div class=commentbody>Yes, a work is coprighted at the moment of it's creation. but maximum protection is only extended to registered copyrights. In the U.S. you register with the US copyright office at: <br><a href=http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/ target=_blank>http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/</a> . $30 would cover the cost of a registration of a single image of suite of images. My knowledge of copyright law is a result of my volunteer time spent with the Graphic Artists Guild. While I've never registered a website, I have registered many images. The process is similar. <br> <br>Mailing a copy to yourself, or "schoolyard copyright" proves nothing in a court of law, except that you mailed it to yourself. It's worthless as far as protecting your interests. This wives tale will still be around long after the postal service has gone out of business. <br> <br>Here's why registration is worthwhile: <br> <br>In the event of an infringement, an unregistered copyright creator would probably search for a lawyer to take his/her case. In court, the holder would then need to prove the damages the infringer inflicted, and would be eligible for actual damages. Not many lawyers would take that case, because the return would be so small..., and more difficult to bring to court. In the end, this person would likely just mail a cease and desist letter without any teeth to back it up and hope the infringer does the right thing. <br> <br>In the event the </div>

<div class=commentbody>> When you are finished with something, burn it to a CD and mail it to yourself. Don't open it unless it's needed for litigation. <br> <br>That is a wives tale. That holds nothing in court. <br> <br>I just delt with something very similar to what Joe was describing, and this wasnt the first time. It was a web related incident. <br> <br>You would be amazed at the power to scare" that a lawyers "cease and desist" letter has. <br> <br>hildebrant,</div>

<div class=commentbody>As far as the poor man's copyright...it is good to point out <br>that this alone is not helpful. <br> <br>But if I remember correctly, it does hold "minor value" in showing <br> <br>1) diligence <br>2) that you are cognizant of intellectual property <br>3) that you want to protect intellectual property <br> <br>Let's say you went in front of a judge and said, <br>"I had no idea I could copyright my web site until <br>I learned it from my attorney." <br> <br>That would hold less weight than the judge hearing <br>how diligent you were in trying to protect your work <br>and seeing your poor man's attempt at copyright. <br> <br>Of course the minor value would only come into play when <br>the poor man's legal maneuver is executed <i>in concert with</i> <br>a properly filed trademark, copyright or patent. <br> <br>I'm not 100 percent sure on this, but I'll check on it this weekend. <br> <br>Also, see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22wives%2Btale%22%2B%22banned%22&btnG=Google%2BSearch" target=_blank> THIS</a> on Language Police and the term <i>wive's tale</i> <br> <br> <br>bj</div>
