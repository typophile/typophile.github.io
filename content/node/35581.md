  now, but it was impossible to resist. I'm still thinking about Ezzo, Priva Pro and
  Leitura so I'd like to hear your opinion about them.

  body: Their typefaces are quite reasonably priced to begin with even before the
    discount. Hmm...now I'm tempted too...

    even mailed me a few samples so that I could figure out which version I needed
    of the text face.\r\n\r\nMusee is the next one on my list. I would totally invest!"

  body: "I'm a big fan of dstype -- nice selection, great prices, and good quality.
    I'll definitely be picking up something before August 14th.\r\n\r\nI use Priva
    for my own materials. It works great for display and text, and it also seems to
    hold up pretty well when printed at low resolutions (like inkjet). My only complaint
    is that the g tends to stick out a little in text blocks, but I've been very pleased
    with it.\r\n\r\nCultura is also one of my favorites. The shapes are beautiful
    and the spacing is a little wider than normal, so it reads a little more smoothly
    in my opinion. I'd love to see it available in OpenType."

    Estilo Script and Volupia), for some new projects. There is also a further discount
    when buying full families \u2013 well worth the buy.\r\n\r\nI bought Cultura a
    few months ago for a job (soon to be completed) and I\u2019m more than pleased
    with it. My only problem is that it would be handier in Opentype format.\r\n\r\nSo\u2026
    buy buy buy!"

  body: Estilo! That's the other one I forgot to mention. Cool, cool, cool typeface.
    Leitura Display was unavailable when I purchased it. How do you like it?

    it. Fantastic for titles (I\u2019m using it for a theatre poster).\r\n\r\nEstilo
    was more of an impulse buy. The price was too good to turn down. Volupia likewise,
    great price and perfect for some quirky theatre production."

  body: Estilo and Estilo Script were just too cool to pass up for how cheap they
    were. As it stands, if a project that needed that sort of treatment came up, I
    wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price for it at all. The amount of work Dino
    puts into them is evident and certainly worthwhile.

  body: "I agree. His typefaces have a distinct personality and surely i will buy
    more. The Leitura Family and Priva Pro are at the top of my wishlist for their
    versatility. I also like very much Ezzo, even if it seems to me a bit decorative
    (perhaps this isn't the right word, pardon my English) and better suited as a
    display than a text face. Did anybody try that?\r\n\r\n> <em>Estilo and Estilo
    Script were just too cool to pass up for how cheap they were.</em>\r\nSo true!"
