  I wonder about logos and how events can change how people perceive logos. Like bp
  (image below courtesy of google images). [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bp-logos-with-rse_500_3952.JPG]\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

    British Petroleum moving to BP, or Kentucky Fried Chicken becoming KFC, all examples
    of cultural norms changing enough that the brand gets a negative connotation.  Also:

    perception. The logo being an indicator of said brand. '

  body: "Certainly a logo or symbol can have negative connotations (a nazi flag, for
    instance).\r\n\r\nRegarding the modified/vandalized BP logos, I doubt if they
    have any substantive impact with the general public, other than with those people
    who already have negative feelings towards BP. \r\n\r\nA more common reason for
    a logo having negative connotation is that it makes the company look old-fashioned,
    or highlights a technology that's now frowned on. For example, an old logo for
    a power company showing smoke stacks with billows of smoke. A few decades ago
    those smokestacks would be a symbol of power and progress; today they would symbolize
    pollution.\r\n"

  body: "The images you showed aren't examples of a company rebranding, they're examples
    of a well-known logo being turned into propaganda against a corporation: In effect,
    leveraging its own brand recognition to discredit the brand.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    companies rebrand to keep up with public opinion: Ronald McDonald is far more
    trim and athletic than he used to be. And Fred Flintstone no longer appears in
    cigarette commercials. \r\n\r\nSome brand disasters are unrelated to the product
    itself. The weight-loss candy product called AYDS disappeared after the the disease
    AIDS became widely known. \r\n\r\nFord is a great master of protecting the integrity
    of the brand through a series of disasters. The blue oval seems to be made of
    Teflon, surviving the Edsel debacle, the Pinto and Explorer lawsuits, and OJ's
    notorious Bronco chase. "
