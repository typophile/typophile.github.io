  of 70s, Avante-Gardey, no? \r\n\r\nSo i'm trying to come up with a suitable companion
  body font to be used in their collateral wherever text is called for: letterhead,
  status report, website, etc. Sans serif is preferred, but i'm a little insecure
  about matching 2 sans together. The font should be both more readable and somewhat
  more formal than Rimouski.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n(First time poster, by the way;
  thanks for a great site.)\r\n\r\nAaron"
