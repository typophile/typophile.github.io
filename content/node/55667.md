  body: "1: Get hold of a broadnibbed pen and start drawing! Essential for understanding
    the fundamentals in type. \r\n2: Print out typefaces you like really huge and
    study them.\r\n3: Take a look at this: http://typophile.com/courses/type110\r\n\r\nGuess
    there are tons of other stuff to learn from."

    you design something, post it in the critique section. If people are willing to
    give feedback, it's usually a lot of help.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Think up a concept. Study lots of existing, good fonts that share some of
    the characteristics you want yours to have (I personally prefer doing this directly
    in FontLab). I've found this even more insightful than the \"Designing Type\"
    book; YMMV.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've got to agree what Jonathan said about posting stuff
    here for critique. Vastly helpful. Btw, it doesn't hurt to start really early:
    I've gotten great input even on really wonky first sketches."

  body: One more questions. Do you know if its better to draw your glyphs in Illustrator
    and then paste them in Fontlab? If so what size do you recommend the size of document
    to be in Illustrator so that the glyphs are the same proportion.
