body: I think the logo is most likely done by hand, but the text used on the packaging
  of the game is not. I was wondering if anyone could ID this font. The sample contains
  the logo, but the ID is for the text underneath &#40;unless someone IDs the logo
  as a font&#41;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66823.jpg"

  body: Do you need to find the exact font or just a similar looking one? In any case,
    I would suggest <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script12Pg1.html" target="_blank">Mike
    Yanega&#39;s Guide</a> as a starting point. <BR> <BR> - Lex <BR> <BR>P.S. There
    is a ton of fonts out there that look similar to this, and you can get one made
    for under ten dollars, so this may be custom.

  body: You&#39;re right, the Logo looks hand-drawn, since no two letters are identical.
    <BR> <BR>However, the lettering underneath that is a font, although as Lex suggested,
    this may be a personal font, since fonts based on hand printing are so cheap to
    make. <BR> <BR>If this is a font I have collected I would most likely have put
    it in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html" target="_blank">Part
    14 &#40;Strange, Distressed scripts&#41; of the Script Font ID Guide</a>. Part
    12, that he pointed you to, is also a possibility, if you don&#39;t see it in
    Part 14.  If you don&#39;t see it in either of those places, my advice is to pick
    something similar. I don&#39;t have time right now, or I would help.

  body: Thanks for the help guys. I wanted to get the actual font for nostalgia&#39;s
    sake, but I think you&#39;re right in that it would&#39;ve been a personal one.
    Anyway, thanks to those links I can find a similar one anyway. Although, if anyone
    manages to find the actual one, please let me know. <BR> <BR>Also, I live in Australia,
    so would any of you know any places or links, that would help me in purchasing
    fonts or getting someone to make one of my own professionally? I wanted to get
    some handwriting made into a font. Wondering if it&#39;s possible for me here
    in Australia. <BR> <BR>Thanks guys.

  body: <a href="http://www.fontifier.com/" target="_blank">Fontifier</a> will let
    you download a template, print your letters in it, scan and upload it, have the
    font produced and download it -- all for $9 &#40;US&#41;. It&#39;s hard to beat
    that deal, although for a while they were doing it for free when it was a new
    service. I think if you&#39;re quick the whole process can take just minutes.

  body: I guess this font won&#39;t be ID&#39;ed. So I&#39;ll let it go, and try to
    do a scan-and-create version with one of those companies/sites. Thanks for all
    the help anyway, guys!
