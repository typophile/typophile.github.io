  body: Then you best trash your CurrentWorkspace.rc file. It seems to be the root
    cause of many of FL's instability. I have found it goes bad from time to time
    and trashing it every few weeks gives me a great deal of stability.

  body: "Let me reveal a bit of \"kitchen secrets\" here. \r\n\r\nOn Mac OS X, one
    of the principal reasons for the stability problems is the fact that the application
    is running in the Rosetta environment, which translates the PowerPC code into
    Intel code. That environment is not completely stable. So the only solution was
    to move the code from PowerPC to Intel, which turned out to be more difficult
    than we originally planned for various reasons: the original code was created
    in the PowerPlant/Metroworks environment for Mac OS 9, and then moved to Mac OS
    X using Carbon. Apple XCode was not around when we first developed FontLab for
    Mac. Unfortunately, PowerPlant/Metroworks was practically discontinued because
    they sold their Intel compiler to a different company a few months before Apple
    announced their plans to move Mac OS X to Intel (one of the worst business decisions
    in the software industry I've heard of, the Metroworks Intel sale, that is). \r\n\r\nFontLab
    Studio is a complex application, and we're a small company (about 10 people) with
    limited resources. Some of our Mac developers got bored with working on font editors
    and left the company to try something new (developing iPhone and iPad apps). We
    hired some new people, but they weren't any good, so we let them go. Then, about
    1.5 years ago, we hired a new team, but we were not sure how well they would manage
    something as important as FontLab Studio, so we put them on the Fontographer 5
    project, which was a bit more experimental (and, in a way, smaller in extent).
    Among others, that project was a test for the new team, and it worked very well.
    We're very happy with Fontographer 5, the developers delivered what they promised
    and the result is a fast and stable application. \r\n\r\nSo we gave the team the
    task of rebuilding FontLab Studio for Mac Intel, while also adding some new features
    and fixing some bugs in the \"core\" code (which is shared between Mac and Windows).
    \r\n\r\nThere will be a new version of FontLab Studio (version 5.5) for Windows
    and for Mac OS X this year. The project is finally well under way, and good people
    are working on it. Personally, I'm very excited about it. I agree that a new version
    is long overdue, and I hope that the users will be pleased with the results. \r\n\r\nBest
    regards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

    There was FontLab 4.0, FontLab 4.5, FontLab Studio 5.0, now we'll have FontLab
    Studio 5.5. It could be also 5.0.7 or 7.0 -- I mean, the version number doesn't
    really mean anything :)\r\n\r\nBut if it does indeed mean something, then: the
    5.5 version number primarily should indicate that the users of current FontLab
    Studio 5 will feel instantly at home with the new version. There won't be any
    radical changes, but some important and useful new features, bugfixes and Mac
    OS X Intel compatibility. "
