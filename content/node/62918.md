  a \"free font,\" the spacing doesn't look up to professional standards.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Runebound/frozen_wastes_previews/princess_preview/princessicononrumorcards.png\r\n\r\nPlease

  body: "\"Magic Cards\" looks to have alphabetics identical to the display text,
    but the numbers are different (and really look like they were a different typeface
    to start with). I suspect that \"Magic Cards\" is something somebody threw together
    to match what started as two separate fonts....\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/magic-cards.font\r\n\r\nSo
    there might be some other font out there with the same letters but different numbers?
    Or are my numbers just from a different typeface?\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I think I was only able to see three numbers (3, 4, 5). That's a tough ID
    chore. It would be easy to suggest similar alternatives, like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sherwood/p22-elven/|P22
    Elven]], but not so easy to spot the original without more numbers. It could come
    from a wide range of font styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I've determined that the display text is Goudy Medieval. But the numbers
    are a different typeface, after all. Drats.\r\n\r\nThe last couple of links (which
    require registration, I know) show the numbers 0-5 at decent size. The 5 in particular
    is quite distinctive.\r\n\r\nThis is tough!\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hey Thomas,\r\n\r\nMy jaw was on the floor. No one had come up with [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/richard_beatty/goudy_mediaeval/|Goudy
    Mediaeval]], in one of its lesser revivals, as a better match than \u201CMagic
    Cards\u201D for the title font. Even though, ostensibly, that is what the card
    designers used here. But, of course, you wanted a match for the numerals, so I
    didn\u2019t chime in before you wisely tracked that one down.\r\n\r\nRest assured
    \u2013 I finally found those for you.\r\n\r\nBefore I get to that, though, I want
    to offer that the distinctive numerals in the set we had to work with are the
    <em>0</em> and the <em>3</em>. All the others \u2013 including the <em>5</em>,
    albeit in condensed form and with a downward-pointing lower terminal \u2013 to
    a great degree emulate the structure of any [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/old-english/|Old
    English]] font and its dozens of freely available knockoffs and derivatives who\u2019s
    creators had no qualms about ripping off numerals. Just sayin\u2019.\r\n\r\nWithout
    further ado: You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a more exact match than [[http://www.sulucas.net/fonts.htm|Boere
    Tudor]]. Unless, of course, you can track down the designer of \u201Cthe first
    Afrikaans family magazine, <em>Die Brandwag</em>\u201D that inspired Su Lucas
    to create it!\r\n\r\n<em>~ William Leverette</em>"

    that identifying the font from just the numerals was going to be very, very difficult.
