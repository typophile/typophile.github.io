  body: "I don't look at many r\xE9sum\xE9s, but I'll give an opinion anyway.\r\n\r\nThe
    top of the r\xE9sum\xE9 has left aligned, right aligned and centered copy. For
    me, this is too much. I would prefer the top to be left aligned, just like the
    body.\r\n\r\nToo much font variation: The worst case is on the job title line,
    for instance, the one that begins \"IT Project Manager\". This line is half empty
    but there are four different font variations! First it's very bold, then its a
    less bold italic, then its a smaller italic with small numbers, then a slightly
    bolder roman with large numbers. On one line! This is two or three variations
    too much. The Adelle font looks nice in the body, though. \r\n\r\nRe: the \"Almost
    PMP certified...\" part at the type. To my eye this font doesn't go with any thing
    else. It's un-needed variation. What is the significance of the gray type throughout?
    Is this the more important stuff, or less important? It seems a little arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIt's
    all just my opinion."

  body: "Besides what J said, the side margins are too small, and the line length
    is so long it's painful to read (around 100 characters--75 would be more comfortable).
    The type can be smaller, and the main headings can hang out into the left margin.
    But I'd avoid going onto a second page; nobody reads the second page of a resume,
    unless you're applying to be the chief brain surgeon at a big university hospital.\r\n\r\nThis
    has nothing to do with typography, but if you have a college degree, you would
    be wise to include it (unless it's in something completely unrelated, like flower
    arranging). \r\n\r\nTo me the word \"exposure\" sounds like \"this is stuff that
    happened to me,\" when what you want to say is \"this is stuff I accomplished.\"
    Could you replace it with something like \"software skills\"?\r\n\r\nIn the same
    vein, it doesn't make a good first impression to have the very first word of your
    resume be \"almost.\" I'd say something like \"Project manager and entrepreneur
    known for successfully leading high-profile development projects through focused
    user-centered design. Currently enrolled in course for PMP certification.\" Also,
    you need a hyphen in \"high-profile\" for the same reason you need one in \"user-centered.\"
    And avoid breaking a hyphenated phrase at the end of a line. "

  body: "Layout:\r\n\r\nA bit too much going on here, try to have a minimum of 25%
    white space.  The paragraphs looks may be a bit too wide I think, try reducing
    the width (45-65 characters is often though of as the optimal). I can't say I'm
    an expert on r\xE9sum\xE9s, but how about making it 2 pages to get the whitespace
    I suggested.\r\n\r\nHow would the email-, twitter- and linkedin-links look as
    a single line on the bottom? \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as J.Tillman said, too much font
    variation. \r\n\r\n\r\nJust some suggestions here :)"

  body: I think the bullets would be better off flush left with the text margin.

  body: "Rules of typography to consider: \r\n\r\n1. Lines should be 60-90 characters
    wide. \r\n2. If your font size is 10, leading should be at least 4, more if your
    font is condensed. \r\n3. On top, it seems you are trying to use a \"newspaper\"
    layout, and you can make it work if you use proper fonts. Right now your mix of
    fonts don't really work. They are almost similar. You want to choose fonts that
    compliment each other yet have contrast. Like an Jenson pro and a medium weight
    condensed avant garde. If you don't have experience mixing fonts, use typefaces
    from a similar family. \r\n\r\nLook at templates and research good typography,
    then apply it to your layout. \r\n\r\nGood luck. \r\n\r\n"
