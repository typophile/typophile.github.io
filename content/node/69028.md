  It's labeled as \"Indestructible Script\" circa 1895. Appears to have been created
  by the Indestructible Type Company, of Chicago, patent pending Lindsay Type Foundry.\r\n\r\nI've
  searched high and low (What the Font + every major & not-so-major foundry I can
  think of) and haven't found this script anywhere! Surely something this lovely hasn't
  died, or has at least been resurrected?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SCAN_1_1_4597.jpg]"

    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/glenda/|Glenda]]. They are not
    this typeface, but they have some of its qualities.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
