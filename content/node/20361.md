  body: "Doh! I looked at the headings\u2026 It might have helped if I read your post
    properly.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, it does look a bit like Brush Script. Note that the
    a\u2019s and i\u2019s are different, so\u2026 not a font? I think it is quite
    a new thing to have alternate characters in digital fonts. How old is the design?"

    is pretty close and that is no doubt why they used it on the site."

  body: "I know...this is an old thread.  Just wanted to chime in here since I designed
    that type for the license plates.\r\n\r\nIt originated on the special Yosemite
    License Plates in 1995-ish.  Our firm was tasked with designing the plates, including
    an original illustration.  I did all of the type and layout, and a very experienced
    painter and illustrator did an original painting that was then imaged electronically.
    \ The \"California\" type design was then used on virtually all (with some exceptions)
    California license plates to this day (how many millions?).\r\n\r\nI have to agree
    with APS221.  But I wasn't convinced until I fired up Illustrator to see for myself.
    \ All these years, I had it in my head that I used Zephyr Script, a Casady & Greene
    font.  Yet today, both Zephyr and Mistral weren't even close, but Rage Italic
    was a virtual match.  Yes, the \"i\" and \"a\" were altered in Illustrator, along
    with other minor alterations, including the tittles above the \"i\"s I believe.\r\n\r\nI
    still have the original files, permanently entombed somewhere on a Syquest drive,
    and I have a few physical license plate prototypes (mfd by 3M) that didn't end
    up being chosen for the final design, along with a few \"SAMPLE\" plates of the
    final design, and one blank finished plate. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope this comes
    in handy for someone...it's definitely Rage Italic."
