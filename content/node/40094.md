  body: "Ages ago I downloaded a \"DR Font Pack\" from usenet, which included the
    top one as \"Wip3out\" (it was used in the PSX game of the same name). I have
    no idea if the fonts were \"real\" in so much as a DR release (possible, knowing
    them and I do vaguely remember an interview with DR/Tomato - Creative Review I
    think - saying they were going to release them) or just a fan-boy creation.\r\n\r\nDafont.com
    might be the place to look for the A-Z only copies.\r\n\r\ns"
