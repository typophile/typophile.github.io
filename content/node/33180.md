  I have made a few quick mock-up, and I would love to know what you think.\r\n\r\n*Please
  excuse the crappy compression on the logo. I think it has something to do with the
  .pdf\r\n\r\n**also excuse all the typos I just noticed.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Consider using a multi-column layout. \r\n\r\nAlso, drop the indents in the
    text blocks under \"Introduction\" and \"New MediaBank 3.1 Release.\" \r\n\r\nYour
    use of blue text seems awkward. I see that you have somewhat of a hierarchy with
    the black, grey and blue text, but I think it could be clearer. \r\n\r\nYour subheads
    could use some more punch. By letterspacing them, you nearly lose the contrast
    you obtained in setting them in bold. \r\n\r\nConsider using a second typeface
    that adds contrasts to Helvetica.\r\n\r\n"
