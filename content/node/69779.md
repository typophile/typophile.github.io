  body: "Um ... er ... many questions:\r\n\r\n- Does your licence cover that conversion?\r\n-
    What format did you start with?\r\n- Are you aware that you can use OT fonts on
    both platforms (PC/Mac)?\r\n- Are you aware that the endash is not a \"small hyphen\"?\r\n-
    What dash exactly is missing?\r\n- In what application did you miss the dash in
    question?\r\n- Does that app. make use of automatic character substitution?\r\n-
    FOG 4.7.2 sounds like Apple Mac - what name and unicode nr did your dash have
    in the first place?\r\n- What TT options _did_ you use?\r\n- Did you notice you're
    in the wrong forum?\r\n- What experience do you have in font conversion?\r\n-
    Are you sure [Y/N]"
