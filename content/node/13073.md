  the \"O\"\r\nb. the width of the \"H\" (measured as the distance between the strokes)\r\nc.
  the letters \"E\" \"P\" (based on the \"H\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "-- Warning, Non-Type Designer -- \r\n\r\nYou seem to have the right things
    in mind. Stems and curves are a good thing to watch. WIth the technology as it
    is today, is it necessary to start a design in this way? It seems to me that you
    do keep the rudimentary elements in mind still, but can push forward much quicker
    without having to worry about test characters. Or not?"

  body: "I think the most important thing -at least concerning Latin caps- is that
    there are two styles of proportions/widths:\r\n1) The classical style, which has
    a lot of divergence; like look at the \"B\" versus the \"D\" in Trajan.\r\n2)
    The modern style, where the widths converge a lot; see Spiekermann's stuff.\r\n\r\nAs
    always though there are exceptions, such as Nick Shinn's Richler.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Tiffany & Hrant.\r\n\r\n I understand that i need to be creative
    with my letters and less mechanical. I think that the main obstacle that I have
    with the serif is:\r\n1. to  measure the width with the serif?\r\n2. if not -
    why not? \r\n\r\nbut again - I don't want to be too mechanical or scientific.\r\n\r\nright
    now I'm studying:\r\n1. Galliard +  Hoefler text\r\n2. Futura + Bauhaus (to understand
    the simple geometric shapes)\r\n3. Myriad + Myriad Condensed (to understand what
    is condensed and to compare it to the regular font)\r\n\r\n\r\nand the next step:\r\ntext
    vs. display (such as Minion)\r\n\r\nand I hope that after that I can start to
    explore more modern designs.\r\n\r\nany thoughts, ideas -- you're welcome....."

  body: I would think that including the serif in measuring the width of a character
    is the actual, but without the serif is the optical.

  body: "Historically, I think designers have typically worked from the elemental
    structures. On the other hand, since serifs <strong>do</strong> exist as more
    than disposable decoration, the <strong>apparent</strong> width is more important
    in the end. In fact it's quite hard -if cozy- to justify reliance on skeletons
    in type design.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Designers tend to see letters are skeletons with stuff wrapped around them.
    I think this is problematic, especially when the structures are chirographic (derived
    from hand movements), but even when they're \"constructed\". We need to see letters
    are contributors to notan (the unity/contrast of black/white).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
