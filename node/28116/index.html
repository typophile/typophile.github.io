  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Okey, I'm creating a logo for a research project of mine. It can be described as <em>a xml-based markup standard for defining graphical user interfaces</em>. The technology name/acronym is XUG, which means, roughly, "XML Graphical User Interface Language for Games". It's kinda like HTML, but for game interfaces.

The general idea is that I wanted something that looks simple and modular. It's not a commercial project, and not something for large database applications, so I don't want anything bussiness-like - it has to be a bit fresh.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xug_logo_5311.png]

<!--break-->
<em></em>
The use of red/green/blue is kinda obvious, since it's a technology for defining the appearance of stuff on screen.

The glyphs are meant to be very simplistic and, again, very modular. The "G" is meant to look like an arrow circling - one of the main features of the technology is the ability to have animations/transitions done easily, so I wanted to give a little hint of that on the logo.

Is it too cliché? I know these blocks around the letters is probably overused, but I can't remember of any similar logo right now. Can anyone remember a good example that will force me to change that?

And what do you guys think overall - does it have too much space between the blocks? Are  the glyphs too heavy?

Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It maybe a little cliched but i generally like it and think it's very appropriate, though it does look a bit too child-like at the moment.

I would...

get rid of the blocks
have the 3 letters in the 3 colours
make the 3 colours a bit less primary
have the 3 letters just touching
make the ends of the strokes only 50% rounded
make the arrowhead not quite so rounded
lower the curve of the U and enlarge the arc of the G a little so they look as big as the X

I don't know exactly what it will look like if you do all that. Quite possibly worse :)

		<div class="commentbody">I like it. Fresh colors, simple yet sturdy, and I get the modularity thing you mentioned.

Maybe the blocks could be more close, I think it's a little too wide now. And the G is too thick; the arrow tends to 'dissappear' now.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good strong idea, agree with the others that the letters probably need to be slightly less thick so you can make the arrow on the "G" clearer. Like the symbolism of it, it's appropriate yet rather subtle. Love the simplicity.

Maybe tweak the colors around a bit, try making them less saturated or try a couple of different color schemes, perhaps even different shades of the same color.</div>

Though I agree with Jon that I would expect to see this logo in a toy store or on baby-care products. It's got huge child-appeal (or, parents of young children-appeal?)

I like the colours. Given your explanation, they make a lot of sense.

I agree with Tiff about the 'roundness'.

I think it's a good logo. But I would love to see what Jon's tweaks do to it. Mostly out of curiousity.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, guys. Good suggestions so far; it all makes sense and I'll review it based on these accounts.

The child-like appearance was bugging me too; it's good to see it's not just me. I think I'll still go with R/G/B, but tweak it a bit to make it less saturated - just a bit more serious.

Spacing and positioning has to be tweaked too. Funny that some stuff started to bug me just because it was mentioned and I wasn't seeing it before. :)

Thanks again!</div>
