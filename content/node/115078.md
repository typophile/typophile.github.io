  It's supposed to look modern and contemporary, but still I want some kind of a subtle
  connection to the proper period. \r\n\r\nDuring research I realized that while I
  have quite a definite idea on how the '30s, '50s or '60s typography looked, it's
  not that obvious with the '40s. Also it's more difficult to find examples of the
  '40s in typography, of course there are lots of movie titles, bit it's not Europe...\r\nI
  assumed that in the middle of the World War II there wasn't too much space for designing
  new typefaces, so they probably used mainly what was designed earlier. But what
  about trends?\r\n\r\nI know these were the times of hand lettering and brush scripts
  were popular, but it's not enough. \r\nI thought about some references to the Art
  Deco lettering, especially that it fits to the fashion subject. It seems to me that
  this trend was still present in the '40s, but I would be grateful for the opinion
  from people who know more than me. \r\nWhat do you think?\r\n"
