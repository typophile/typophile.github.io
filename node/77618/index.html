  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was born Gereformeerd. Gereformeerd is or was in my youth a denomination within the Dutch Protestant orbit stemming from the Calvinistic response to 15th-century Catholicism. While keeping our distance from denominational expressions of Christianity my immediate family and I still keep to some of the observances ensconced in the wider Christian tradition. For Christmas I asked for and received copies of Stanislas Dehaene’s recent book <em>Reading in the Brain: the Science and Evolution of a Human Invention</em>, and Oliver Sacks’s <em>The Mind's Eye</em>. <em>The Mind's Eye</em> describes, among other things, the case of Howard Engel, the Canadian detective story writer who lost his ability to read due to a lesion caused by a stroke, in what Dehaene, the author of the other book, and his research associates have dubbed the Visual Word Form Area of the brain (VWFA). In <em>Reading in the Brain</em> the VWFA is called “The Brain's Letterbox”. <em>Reading in the Brain</em> describes: how we read; the VWFA; the neuronal basis for reading; the evolution of writing; learning to read; the dyslexic brain; reading and symmetry; the author’s own pet theory of neuronal recycling; and it speculates about neuronal recycling as the basis of culture.

Along the way Dehaene forcefully (his word) blasts (my word) the Whole Language approach to reading instruction, mostly on account of the apparently well-documented damage it’s "Whole-Word" instructional bias has caused to literacy. The bug-a-boo is the approach’s sidelining of the systematic inculcation of phonemic awareness. "Cognitive psychology directly refutes any notion of teaching via a 'global" or "whole language" method." Dehaene incidentally keeps his description of this method vague.

I haven’t finished reading the entire book, but noticed in passing that, as part of this critique, Dehaene mentions that the emphasis on the global shape of words “also invaded the world of typography, where the term “bouma” (named after the Dutch psychologist Herman Bouma), was coined to refer to the contours of words.” Deheane adds, “In the hope of improving readability, typographers intentionally designed fonts that created the most distinctive visual “boumas.” His source for this observation is — wouldn't you know it — Kevin Larson's 2004 “The Science of Word Recognition.”

I of course find this somewhat disappointing because the slight involves a misreading of what Bouma Shape was actually coined to refer to — something more than “contour” or the “global shape” of words. Perhaps the slight or slam is excusable, but digging deeper into both the psychological literature where it originated (Insup and Martin M. Taylor’s <em>The Psychology of Reading</em>), or Paul Saenger’s <em>Space Between Words</em>, or the peregrinations on typophile surrounding the term might have induced Dehaene to explore the matter a bit more fully.

The book is wonderfully provocative though, and it has it’s uses. In some places the language positively sparkles. And it has an endorsement from Oliver Sacks. Moreover, it’s a fairly manageable and, for the most part, internally cohesive compendium of a host of empirical rummaging in various domains. It’s also a bit of patch-work in places, in that there are disparities between several of the ways of seeing reading that Dehaene recruits to build his case. For example, Dehaene passes along the interactive activation model but his own local-combination detection based approach doesn’t fully mesh with the interactive activation account’s basic premises.

But somewhere in the section on “The Brain’s Letterbox” I had to take a break. The reason's were: 1) my ever-mounting frustration with the — to me — too rudimentary notion of how words are encoded in the brain — i.e., according to their spellings — became insurmountable, as did 2) an intense feeling that I had to make a more significant concession to the parallel letter recognition scheme than I had felt able to make before. In other words, I felt I needed to rethink the “inhibition of incipient recognitions for letters” idea I had found in Edmund Burke Huey. I felt the need to try and plot a “convergence of perspectives.”

The long and short of this is that my thinking is entering a bit of a new phase. Basically the idea is that on the new iteration of my scheme, categorical perception at the letter level can and does occur, but it doesn’t normally or necessarily lead to an independent downstream labeling in the higher regions of the brain. This is a kind of paradox that might require further elaboration. A similacrum of parallel letter recognition happens, but parallel letter recognition as currently schematized isn’t the central or foundational mechanism. The central mechanism remains for me the variety of “feature analytic processing” or “simultaneous co-activation of letter parts” I tried to describe in the recent “Monitor on Psychology” thread, and prior to that in TypeCon Atlanta, and the central event for me remains Bill’s notion of matrix resonance.

I’m thinking of starting a typophile blog page to describe 1) how I now see the structure of the underlying matrix — the inner bouma, if you will, 2) how I think it becomes established, and 3) how the connection with it is made in normal reading contexts. 

I think I might call my scheme “distal ring plus proximate ring coding” or some such thing. DRAPE-coding for short.

I'll do that when I get a chance, and if my intuitions about this stick.

I don't believe the major concern of type designers is either letter shapes or word shapes -- this formulation of our readability concern is simplistic, if not banal. We place a great deal of importance on "fit" -- of which letter spacing (sidebearings and kerning) is as important a component as glyph shape.

I design typefaces as combinatory glyph reading systems with the goal of making individual letters look good as well as syllables, words, sentences and paragraphs -- at sizes from small body text to large display, in various media and with various text content. My readability concerns transcend the simple distinction that scientists have so far made between reading letters and reading words. 

I will not have my work reduced to the level of their understanding.
It is a gross misrepresentation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course, one can go back to "Typographical Printing-Surfaces" to look at comparisons of letter outlines for differences. But the original point was about the "boumas", which is supposed to be the look of an entire word.

I suppose that if research is to transcend the idea that words are only perceived as individual letters, according to their spelling... one should study people who read Hebrew or Arabic, where the individual letters are particularly challenging to read, and so being able to use context speeds things up considerably - too much to be ignored.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, Stanislas Dehaene puts forward a combinatorially-based hierarchical coding scheme that moves from oriented bars through letter fragments, case-specific letter shapes, and local bigrams to frequent substrings, morphemes, small words and beyond. He might applaud your concern to make all these things look good, and recruit your list as evidence for the aptness of his scheme.

In relation to your ‘fit’ comment, I’d say the type designer and typographer is oriented to strengthening our immediate or everyday, ordinary, lived-experience of words as 1) unitary rather than broken-up or fractured; 2) internally differentiated but not chaotic; 3) uncrowded; 4) familiar rather than foreign, or strange; and 5) sense-invested rather than as cryptic or meaningless things. As you say, “letter spacing (sidebearings and kerning) is as important a component as glyph shape” in ‘fit’. Perhaps scientists understand this, perhaps they don’t. But a hierarchical scheme such as Dehaene presents, with local combination detection as it’s foundational routine and parallel letter recognition as it’s defining mechanism, has difficulty addressing how it is that we experience words in this way.

So that's in part where my discomfort lies, and one of the things that motivates my search for a less heirarchical and less letter-based coding scheme. But of course, “global shape” or “outer contour” don’t do any better at addressing or lived experience of words. I want a coding scheme that is both richly evidence-based and addresses the lived experience of skilled readers.</div>

I don't believe that's possible.
Consider music, where coding has been split into categories such as tempo, pitch, timbre, harmony, etc.
Listeners can decode, concentrating on these different categories as they see fit.
The map is not the territory.

		<div class="commentbody">I believe there is indeed a good chance that, yes, due to both Hebrew and Arabic being normally written so that individual letters are considerably less legible (or certain pairs of letters are much harder to distinguish, to be specific) than with the Latin alphabet, it may well be easier to experimentally detect the contribution of recognizing the shape of a word as a whole in reading those languages.

The skepticism of other posters about being able to determine what is really going on when people read through the kind of clumsy experimental techniques that are available is justified, but, on the other hand, that is not an excuse for not doing what we can to at least begin to have hard evidence and quantitative measures which can be a solid foundation for some forms of progress.

Not everything can be made a science instead of an art. But those things that have been changed from craft to engineering have yielded great progress. So if even a sliver of the type designer's art can be aided by science, it could well be worthwhile.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I know the map is not the territory, but I think I’ve happened upon a description that can address your skepticism about the powers of coding schemes. John, I’m not sure I can produce hard evidence at the outset, or introduce quantitative measures without assistance, but there are tantalizing convergences in existing data sets. Christopher, I’ll do my best.

I’m going to wait with my description until I’ve finished reading Dehaene.

As a side note to my comment about Dehaene’s dismissal of the Whole Language approach to reading instruction let me say that, on my view the testing of and systematic inculcation of phonemic awareness is vitally important. It's just not all there is. Systematic inculcation of phonemic awareness forces the mind to create vectors over bigrams, syllables, morphemes and small words. This is good. It also tends to erect a hierarchical and dendritically complex coding architecture. (Dendritic, means tree-like.) This is the kind of architecture Dehaene's book describes. Such hierarchies can be difficult for a processing routine to navigate. It's basis is a decomposition into letter-wholes. A less coarse-grained, more elemental recoding has to happen alongside of vector-formation to make word recognition rapid, automatic and effortless.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When we first learn to read, we sound out syllables and check memory maps for similar phonic or written matches.  We also do this when we come across a foreign word or words new to us that are in our own language. After enough readings, we learn the word as well as the glyphs and then read it more quickly without needing so much time needed for analysis. This process never stops as long as you come across an unfamiliar pattern of glyphs. Read any foreign text or a technical jargon that you are not familiar with and you slow down, decode, compare, and interpret or find a source to translate what is still a mystery. I don't see how we are talking about an exclusive either-or situation.  The brain is much smarter than we give it credit for. Reductionism only works some of the time, the brain works all of the time, even if the answer is "I don't know that word"</div>

<strong>Abstract</strong>
This study seeks to provide new insight into the phonemic, orthographic, and syntactic awareness of individuals with prelingual deafness and the way those contribute to reading. Two tests were used: one designed for the assessment of phonemic/orthographic awareness (PO/OA) and another examining reading comprehension (RC) in contexts where prior knowledge was either helpful or not. Participants were 83 prelingually deaf individuals (DIs): 21 primary school, 36 high school, and 26 university students. The control group consisted of 85 hearing individuals (HIs) from parallel education levels (29 primary school, 29 high school, 27 university). Contrary to predictions made by current reading theories, findings imply that the failure of DIs to develop sensitivity to the phonological properties of words may not underlie their reading difficulties. Rather, this weakness seems to reflect a processing deficit at the supra-lexical (sentence) level where the final meaning of single words is elaborated by its integration based upon syntactic (structural) knowledge.

<em>“Given that an adult reader’s eye registers not individual letters but whole words, or parts of them, it is not surprising that words play a particularly important role in the reading process.

I didn’t actually tackle the whole language debate because it’s not a debate anymore. The whole language idea for teaching reading was to provide a positive, reading-rich environment, and children will just naturally learn to read on their own. While it is certainly a good idea to read to your kids, it is false that kids will learn to read without direct instruction (some will, most won’t). Kids need to learn certain precursors to reading, particularly letter recognition and phonemic awareness. Kids who have learned these skills will go on to become proficient readers, and kids that are struggling to read in the 2nd and 3rd grades are still poor at these skills. I hope to turn this talk into a paper this year.

		<div class="commentbody">Right Kevin, I think I can empathize with your motivation: it seems wrong to suggest that the adult reader’s eye doesn’t — in some form or other — register letters, but I wonder if you think that when Jost Hochuli says ‘whole words’, what this contains for him can be adequately circumscribed by terms like “envelope”, or “outline”, or “global shape”, or locutions like “the raw pattern of x-height neutral, ascending and descending shapes?” Is this in effect what the typographers you consulted and Jost Hoculi were anxious to convey?

And if it isn’t, or can’t, can a marshaling of evidence that shows that “envelope”, or “outline”, or “global shape”, or “the raw pattern of x-height neutral, ascending and descending shapes” are in fact not used actually falsify Hochuli’s claim?

I’m not sure how to properly operationalize ‘whole words’, but it seems wrong to me to do this with the terms I've place inside double quotation marks.

The writings of James Townsend and Michael Wenger lead us to ask: “Is it possible to translate, [pe (their words, with my insertion here): within the realm of perceptual processes in reading], an inchoate notion of holistic or gestalt processing into a set of more precisely specified possibilities based on the characteristics of information processing?” Townsend and Wenger’s try to do this (witin the neural network domain) in terms of process architectures, stopping rules, degrees of process independence and process capacity. We might be well-served by taking a close look at how they try to do and test this.</div>

Look. One of the fundamental, no... foundational principles of readability design, in the realm of optical trickery,  is the modest to excessive exaggeration of the lowercase ht. relative to all other hts. Now, the accompanying ascenders and descenders are shortened in this process. That's not an option, it's a requirement, and this most assuredly has a clear impact on diminishing the uniqueness of word shape. Thus, anyone who says what's quoted above is not saying it right, or worse, not doing it right, or even worse simply not a designer of readable  faces and just blabbing for gold.

Maybe, this Hochuli fellow was thinking of headline fonts, where indeed the design  of larger size provides spacial freedom to wander more in word shape via letter forming, but not in design for readability. On a much larger scale, I still wonder how those hundreds of millions of  letterless  Chinese get any reading done at all, without word shape recognition.      </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Legibility and readability are two different things, and legibility is easier to measure than readability - as others have noted in this forum in other discussions.

Typefaces like the Linotype newspaper face Corona, or the 4 3/4 size of Times Roman designed for what the British call "Newspaper Smalls", known as Claritas, most definitely exaggerate the x-height. This allows letters like a, c, e, and o to be distinguished from each other.

But once letters have a large enough size so that legibility is not the issue, instead of going from 11 point Times Roman to 14 point Times Roman, going to 11 point Times Roman with three points of leading is a more reasonable thing to do. (Admittedly, three points of leading is a bit much, unless the lines are quite long.)

Better yet, though, would be to <em>use</em> that empty space, and make the ascenders and descenders longer.

Most English words can't be distinguished from each other purely on the basis of their pattern of ascenders and descenders. So if a lowercase "e" looks like a <em>dot</em> in the point size in use, reading will not take place. So "word shape" will have to involve delving a bit further down into the word, and it will only be a help to reading, not the main engine of reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks David H. for summary of the paper on Hebrew vs English reading. It makes sense that Hebrew readers process via a common root path, since the roots are so much of an organizing principle in Hebrew. In English we have such a mixture of sources we are most often unaware of roots. I don't know whether this implies anything with regard to the issue of letter recognition first or not. That's because in Hebrew root and meaning usually, but not always go together. 

David B., Peter's theory does not privilege extenders over other letter features, and their length is not the main thing. This idea that whole word pattern is just a matter of ascenders and descenders was an oversimplification of the idea of word pattern. In Peter's view it was a straw man used to dismiss a promising line of research, which he has taken up.  </div>

IMO this is a "legibility" requirement.
Consider this model of the reading process:

1. Sentence structure (purely textual) suggests a set of options for the upcoming word.
2. Word shape narrows the field.
3. However, at small size, legibility is more important to fine tune the exact coding, as more acuity is needed to distinguish letters precisely, for instance, differentiating between "e", "a" and "s". Therefore x ht is made larger for small text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, for your #2, I'd say <em>the compilation of ensemble or summary statistics in parafoveal vision</em> narrows the field. Both terms occur in the perceptual psychophysical literature on object perception and crowding, and in some cases reading. Summary statistics capture more than information about the outer contour of the word, but not as much or as accurately as the information made available by ‘sharp-rendering’ in foveal vision. This is shown by a juxtaposition of the tests that Kevin recruits to argue that “letters are used,” with tests that show words in parafoveal vision are susceptible to “silent substitution” [Denis Pelli]. But in the case of words, summary statistics render precise identity indeterminate.

In relation to your #3, I’d drop the word ‘legibility’ and say <em>access to role-unit level information</em> is important to fine tune the exact coding. This is as true at normal sizes, where acuity is not a problem, as at small sizes. At small sizes, it's not that more acuity is needed, but that there are thresholds to discrimination affordance, which can to some degree be addressed by fiddling with x-height.

Role-unit level information is letter-part level information, that is information about the shapes of counters and individual strokes.</div>

Kevin: <em>I developed the word recognition talk and paper because the people on my team at Microsoft (as well as other typographers and type designers) told me that they were designing for word shape.</em>

Type designers have historically made a lot of more or less voodoo claims about how they work -- e.g. 'designing the white not the black' --, especially then they are to be quoted in print. The disconnect between how people claim to work, or how they think they work, and how they are actually observed to work can be considerable.

Words are the primary context of letters, so of course when we design letters we look at them in words, and we adjust them to produce words that look good. We also look at them in sentences, and paragraphs, and pages of text, because these are also contexts of letters, and we want the typeface to look good in all these contexts, and different contexts reveal different things about the design. For instance, the slightly-too-heavy left diagonal on a letter v might not reveal itself when looking at some individual words, but will reveal itself in page tests.

I can't honestly recall any colleagues claiming to design for word <em>shape,</em> in the sense of word envelope. Rather, I reckon we might reasonably claim to design for words, in Peter's excellent phrase, as ‘lettered things’. And by the same token we design for sentences, for paragraphs, for pages....</div>

I quite agree. I know I tend to design for letterfit with left and right neighbor.  Typically, the same kind of groupings into classes we use for kerning, tend to yield what I will call "shape groups" for fitting and sidebearings.  I, and others, make necklaces of glyphs that put each glyph in position with all of its potential neighbors as well as control characters to check fit.  After coming to some reasonable satisfaction with this process, long texts of various languages are set and printed at various sizes looking for fit, color, readability, and even aesthetics. This is not just a word outline, it is permutations of all players to seek problems out and solve them.</div>

That is fantastic if most typographers and type designers don't actually believe in simple word shape, then we’re in agreement. I know I come across arguments that suggest that this isn’t always the case. The page after the Hochuli quote above shows a word (Alphabet) with an envelope drawn around the word.

James Felici’s 2003 book The Complete Manual of Typography shows three images of the bottom half of words, the top half of words, and unoccluded words: <em>“Our comprehension of the text we read is based largely on the tops of lowercase letters, the bottom halves consisting mostly of “legs and feet.” The top sample here is impossible to decipher, but the middle sample is comprehensible. Rendering those shapes into patterns enables us to recognize whole words and phrases at a glance.”</em>

'...and only believe some of what you read'

Rolf Rehe's1974 book "Typography, How to Make it Most Legible" [the one with the crashing over-tracked Helvetica cover] became the mantra of many design educators. Page 35 shows a  word-shape example to describe how lowercase reads better than uppercase. There were other  studies at that period in time professing the "Top half of words" theory.  This is the period in time that spawned most of today's design professors, therefore the spreaders of the true WORD on what is good typography to today's young designers. Sadly, some of these theories which were tested to some degree, were quickly elevated to the level of "GOSPEL TRUTH" in the eyes of adjunct professors seeking tenure on the grounds that they were actually using Science to teach design. I guess some folks, including Mr Felici, still give these theories more ink than they deserve. When social scientists measured for the density of information in upper vs lower halves of words, they found an interesting tidbit of information which may help other scientists explain reading in the future.  It was the design education community of that era that went a bit overboard with it, not the scientists. In practical use, cutting off the bottom half does less damage than cutting off the top half but it still Does Damage.  It is like saying most human activity and sustaining organs are in the the top half of the body.  Cuttoff the head or thorax and death swiftly follows.  Cuttoff the lower half and you will still live to be a happy paraplegic with a colostomy bag and a hampered sex life. Design professors used this kind of thing as a parlor trick to show they read the research.

		<div class="commentbody">I wouldn't equate any general understanding amongst typographers that people read word shapes with the way that type designers work.

Do type designers ignore the idea that people read word shapes, even if we happen to believe it's true? I would say so. There is a gulf between theory and practice. I mean, how would a type designer put the "word shape" theory into practice?

H&FJ give some indication of not having done so in their description of the nonetheless very word-shapey Mercury, by not mentioning word-shape readability benefits, leading me to believe that it was not an explicit criterion in the type's design, whereas these other criteria which led to short capitals with much higher ascenders are cited: "…[allowing ascenders] to help define the lower case", "…more compact capitals that help economize on space", "…a useful advantage for older typesetting systems that aren’t equipped to handle true small caps", and "…look[ing] less conspicuous on the printed page." --

<blockquote><strong>Maximal Lowercase</strong>
Every typeface designed for small sizes begins with a large x-height, which helps a font feel bigger than it really is. Where Mercury differs from most newspaper faces is in its ascenders and descenders: many fonts truncate these forms, rather than allowing their shapes to help define the lowercase.

<strong>Minimal Caps</strong>
Mercury uncouples the height of the ascenders from the size of the caps, and introduces more compact capitals that help economize on space. As an added benefit, abbreviations set in ALL CAPS merge more seamlessly with the text, a useful advantage for older typesetting systems that aren’t equipped to handle true small caps.

<strong>Efficient Widths</strong>
Even many classic newspaper faces have sprawling capitals (Times Roman, despite its popularity, has some of the worst.) Mercury’s capitals have been made as discreet as possible in order to look less conspicuous on the printed page — an especially important feature when setting news stories that are filled with proper names.</blockquote>

I would suspect that if word-shape had been the principle upon which a type was designed, then it would have been mentioned in promotional material and type histories -- but I have never come across any such thing.

If we accept that prioritizing word shape leads to small x-height, then ironically, or perhaps paradoxically, the claim of "large x-height for superior readability" is usually made, if any readability claims relative at all to word shape are made, and I have never seen a face described as "small x-height for superior readability".

<cite>"I can't honestly recall any colleagues claiming to design for word shape, in the sense of word envelope."</cite>

<cite>That is fantastic if most typographers and type designers don't actually believe in simple word shape, then we’re in agreement.</cite>

As three experts have already noted above, there's a distinction between typographers and type designers with respect to this issue. Typographers do believe in word shape to some extent, which is why they prefer using normal upper and lower case to ALL CAPS. But there isn't much that type designers <em>can</em> do about word shape; after designing each individual letter to be beautiful, and then ensuring that the letters look like they belong together, and then adjusting for the right side-to-side fit, there's not much they can do for more distant concerns.

However, there is one respect in which this isn't entirely true.

Type designers - at least if they're trying to revive Jenson or Aldus - do tend to try for generous ascenders and descenders. It's commercial considerations, not aesthetic ones, that led to the stubby descenders of Caslon 540, Goudy Old Style, and even Times New Roman.

Of course, there are also typefaces in which the x-height is very small for a deliberate effect in a display face.

But the ascender and descender height of a classic face (Cloister Lightface, Bembo, Poliphilus, Caslon Old Style, Garamond) is, I would think, generally regarded as optimal for readability provided a suitable point size of type is used.

For applications where smaller point sizes are used, well, you can't have readability if you don't have legibility: the two are not the same, but legibility is a prerequisite for readability. Definitely at 8 point and below, and even at, say, 10 point (and the default settings on computers are such that "12 point" is really often "10 1/2 point, with 1 1/2 point leading" - I was quoting foundry type sizes, not what you get these days) you do need a large x-height. But that's a situation where one is struggling for legibility in the face of severe constraints, not one in which optimal readability is possible of achievement.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">JH> Type designers have historically made a lot of more or less voodoo claims about how they work...

An interesting take, and that may be so, but I think it's a different thing to publicize a flavor of voodoo, as if it were normal, when it is in fact contrary to good practice. 

The bottom line on letter vs. word for me, and perhaps for type design aimed at any sort of automated composition, is that I can give you letters that might look rather uneven and contrary-looking to each other (see Goudy, Brody or Excoffon), but if you allow an expert composer control over the word making, readability emerges from a seeming mishmash of letters. 

And, I can give you even and compatible-looking letters to each other with perfect spacing,(see a lot of stuff), but if you arbitrarily miscompose them (even by thin spaces), there are situations where words will just become a mishmash of letters.

So, I think it's just simply much more important not to fool around with word shape than pretty much anything else.

What you imply by ‘word shape’, though, based on your comments, is something very different from word envelope as illustrated by Rolf, Hochuli et al. You are talking about the relationship of letters and how they succeed or fail to cohere as what I'll call wordforms, since the meaning of ‘word shape’ is ambiguous. This is a cognate of letterforms and, like letterforms, wordforms are composed of the relationship of positive and negative shapes, and it has to do, as you say, with how type is used (composed). The obvious conclusion to draw is that any typeface <em>optimally</em> produces wordforms at a specific size, track, resolution, etc., and may only acceptably produce wordforms at some variations of those factors, and not at all at others.

[By the way, speaking about type for specific sizes and resolutions, when a font is identified at webtype.com as being intended for a particular px size range, is that CSS pixels or actual device pixels? That is, is it an optical size target or a ppem target?]</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">David [B]: below is a riff on what you wrote.

A letter is a combination of 1) positive shapes built up from black strokes, and 2) white or negative space. The white space is the space around and inside the letter and the negative space, the space between the strokes. The space around the letter is background. When the negative space is the space between adjacent or opposing strokes — that is, the space inside the letter where the background shows through —, it can have a shape, or be given form. Negative or white space becomes evoked form with a more or less tractable shape. Designers of letters attend to both: for the designer a letter is two shapes. Both the black and the white are information for vision. Perceptual psychologists and cognitive scientists tend to forget about the white.

A word is exponentially more complex. On the one hand it is — at least in alphabetic scripts — an ordered combination of letters. On another level, it is an aggregation of the shapes, the more elemental whites, and the simple-to-complex stroke-constituted blacks. Within the word the combination of letters makes a second set of whites — between-letter whites. These whites appear to be less shaped and less informative. Yet conventional craft wisdom wants <em>all</em> the whites to be ‘in synch’ and it wants the blacks to be well-coordinated according to their proportions (the implementation of Cartesian space), weights, compositional logic (construction) and ‘swept-object’ logic (contrast). The total wordfrom is the totality of all this: the totality of in synch whites and the coordinated blacks. 

Notan-think wants the black and white to be completely equipotent. Designers should at least think of how they relate. (This has to do with ‘colour.’)

All of these things interface with sight. A functional ontology of reading has to go hand in hand with a well-developed theory of writing. Currently they don’t. For example, arranging the whites so they are in synch, and tuning the blacks so they are well-coordinated affects ‘phase’ alignment. Arguably this will have an impact on processing routines. It will bias the system toward taking a more holistic or gestalt approach. But what that means in neural architecture and information processing terms is unclear. So the question becomes again, “Is it possible to translate an inchoate notion of holistic or gestalt processing into a set of more precisely specified possibilities based on the characteristics of information processing?”

I said both the black and the white are information for vision. By Stanislas Dehaene’s logic the decomposition of words into their component letters and the increase in phonemic awareness has to have something to do with the adaption of certain parts of the lateral geniculate nucleus to reading. I’ll bet ‘reading’ the whites, and the neural entrenchment of a decomposition of the blacks into role-units (through writing!) does too.

Of course you didn't, but you used the term ‘word shape’ in the context of a discussion in which, among other things, this has been associated with word envelope. My point was that it would be best to avoid this ambiguous phrase and be quite specific about what we mean, individually, when we talk about letters and words. I agreed with your comments, but thought you risked confusion by referring to word <em>shape.</em>

[<em>And, would you ever use "CSS pixels" to describe anything to the public without saying so.?</em>]

I wouldn't mention ‘px’ at all in relationship to the Web without specifying exactly what I meant. px is a CSS unit measurement, and since @font-face implies use of CSS, I think it is more than likely that use of ‘px’ is going to be interpreted in terms of CSS code. I wanted to confirm whether or not that was your intention.</div>

Lol, well go on ahead then... But first, let me fill you in, since you don't type direct any web font services, and maybe ya don't know any normal users.
  There is no "actual size" for specification type on the web.(ahem)
  Most users have no clue about how pixels become px to become different from pixels.
  Our larger RE fonts read well to 4.5 point (where a pixel is at least .5 point). 
  WT says "Paragraphs, 9px–14px", so that's how much space you have to specify "exactly what you mean". 
  If you don't say exactly and precisely the right thing, the word shapes can become unclear through misunderstanding of size. :)

		<div class="commentbody">White space not enclosed by the glyph takes on great importance when glyphs have neighbors.  The resulting shape of the interlocking white spaces created when set together is every bit as descriptive of the letter-word conglomeration as the black that it brings to life. You cannot make a form without it being affected by the shape it makes in its surroundings. To call this a "word shape" for want of a better term is okay, but to then redefine "wordshape" as something loosely encompassing the blurred outer edge of the word, is a different story.  If we need a term for the lassoed shape of the word without consideration of all the internal and external whitespace, then let's create 2 separate terms.  Granted, some negative shapes do less to activate the figure than others but this, perhaps, aids in reading and helps us decode the forms.  I don't know this to be true but I would hate to throw out avenues of investigation just to be neat and tidy with terminology.  We have a tendency to spend more time arguing about the exact classification of pigeon holes than we do looking at the migrations of birds.</div>

The longer the lassoo, the more it comes to represent individually discernible letters.

A similar difficulty occurs with open counters: the boundary between internal white space and between letter spacing is fuzzy.

But at some point in the perceptual process, a decision must be made which fixes such values, in terms of their textual meaning.

In the language of quantum physics, this might be described as decoherence -- the untangling of multiple quantum states (possible words) into a single macroscopic meaning, or reality as it is read.</div>

Yes, the discussion is interesting for me. The participants argue at a considerable level. The weak point is the separation of type design from other kinds of lettering and from handwriting. Under general conditions you make the counters by enclosing them between consecutive strokes; by isolating pieces of shape from the world wide background. It does not make any difference whether successive strokes belong to the same letter or to the space between letters. Typography breaks the pattern of strokes. The counters of the letters are prefabricated in typefaces. Only typesetting makes the white shapes between the letters. Rolf Rehe demonstrated impressively how a self-indulgent typographer may spoil the equilibrium. The jammed shapes can’t dance anymore. We should regard typography as a special instance of lettering that obeys the same laws.

In a subsequent e-mail he added: Feel free to throw my reaction into the ring.

That is it in the nutshell! Neighbors semi-enclose the sum of their adjoining negative spaces, thereby, creating a new shape that describes their union as much as it described the glyphs individually before. Letter pairings, or groupings, make distinct shapes which probably are not describable as a specific object but none-the-less contribute to reading a word or words.

		<div class="commentbody">Peter,
Can I ask you why do you find the hierarchical model used by Dehaene has difficulty with your description of our lived-experience of words?

I'm asking this because, when I read the part of the book where D. explains this hierarchical model (if I remember: neurons that can discriminate between black and white, group of neurons that can see the difference between more complex things, etc.) I thought: this is the little door from where someone can re-introduce the 'wordshape'. You only need to 'enter' at the level of 'word' (to give an example: When I see a tree, I have no doubts that a single neuron only knows about really simple stimuli, but from my 'normal', 'natural' knowledge – our lived-experience – I see a whole tree.)

Moreover, if we think about, a text (set with type or written) is hierarchical because (as someone said before) we have spaces that define words, spaces that define lines, paragraphs, etc. Organizing phenomena with hierarchy seems to me the 'normal' way our perception works.

("My" point of view is that white spaces are there to define hierarchy.)

By the way, there are also other thing interesting in the book: what he calls proto-letters (simple shapes recognized by primates), graphic 'invariants' in writing, for example.</div>

White spaces between letters, lines, etc. define (or contribute to the definition of)  the contour of the 'object'. That's why I think that the function of white spaces is the definition of hierarchy. (Moreover, you notice white spaces when they are 'wrong': wrong letter spacing etc.)
By the way, If you remove the white spaces it is very hard to read. 

Another thing about white space: Longer ascenders and descenders, for early typographers and generally for letterpress printer, had also the side effect of a bigger gap between lines (they didn't have 'leading', right?, so this was the only way to achieve a bigger line height) and hence a better line definition, etc.. This side effect, maybe, can partially explain the improvement in legibility of longer ascender/descender.

But I'm not an expert</div>

Letter, word, line, paragraph and section definition are important things and a hierarchy of white space helps delineate them for vision — see Gerrit Noordzij, <em>Letterletter</em> (the book) page 126. Such delineations help us navigate the text.

In Deheane’s hierarchy anything beyond V4, starting with his “abstract letter detectors,” but including identity as a word, exists outside or beyond the visual cortex. The only representation of shape that is responded to — beyond V4 — is ‘orthographic shape,’ and that is done by way of local (open) bigram detection. Global shape is not a feature that is used. You can’t enter the recognition hierarchy at the top level, you have to come up from the bottom.

When I used “unitary” above, I didn’t only mean “as an independent unit.” I also had in mind “whole,” in a gestalt sense of figural, with a unique internal structure of <em>intrinsically</em> interconnected parts.

As far as I know, all letter press printers have strips of lead for leading, but I'm not sure when these strips were first invented.</div>

Interesting analysis. I think you have here a valuable insight, and a mistake. You have a good point that "figure" and "ground" are probably treated differently in the brain. I suspect you are right that the shapes of the whites themselves are not "read" by the brain *as shapes*. And this is where Frutiger's statement that type design is about "designing the whites" is misleading. And I suspect that Peter's "role units" as "atoms" making up a word pattern don't include white shapes themselves. 

Where I think where you are mistaken is on the importance of the white spaces, in spite of their shapes not being "read" directly. That is because the ground helps define the "figure". Getting width of the letter spaces right is important to reading, as it is important to get the rhythm of the blacks, and the overall density—"typographic color"— of a word, and of the text, right. Rhythm and color are both important to readability. There are also other issues of the relation between black and white, related to optical illusions such as Mach bands and the picket fence effect.

Finally I should note that your use of the the term "word outlines" is not clear. If it means the outer perimeter of the word, as in the citations of Kevin, then it has little to do with Peter's theory, or with how we actually read. I prefer the phrase "spatial pattern of sub-letter features across the whole word" to explain how skilled readers normally recognize words. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniele, a further (cryptic) thought: Hierarchical coding has it's uses. Extrinsic stabalization — which is what happens through teaching in reading acquisition — combined with narrow phase alignment and the rhythmic formatting of the whites inside the word — gives rise to intrinsic integration at the level of role-units.

I'm going to describe an encoding of order that places information about fine-grained recognitional parts in concentric rings around salient centres (of the coarser granularity of letter-wholes). Sets of these combine to form highly redundant matrices. These become synaptically entrenched. We identify familiar words in immersive reading not by climbing ladders but through matrix resonance.

The idea is that there’s another way of schematizing the encoding of order that makes better sense of how we experience words.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While I understand Bill's reasoning and Christians preference for looking at a different order of magnitude to describe how he works, I don't think we can ignore what the negative space does at any level of description.  We can debate how much we "choose" to infer from negative vs positive shapes but we cannot deny that form is described simultaneously by both! As much as the black describes the white, the white describes the black.  There is an interlocking that occurs without the need for a hierarchy.  The better the two interact with each-other, the more descriptive the form and accurate the read. My guess would be that the earliest humans (probably all animals as well that survive partially on vision) developed this keen sense of quickly extracting a form from its surrounding noise if for no other reason than detecting both predator and prey. I surmise that this early "instinct" that evolved further into a "skill" survives today in all of us as "that which makes visual decoding of all things practical" to us.  This includes reading, sign recognition, logo recognition, and still includes "that eery feeling" about walking down a certain fear-inducing path.

Leading: I think that early printers didn't use strip of lead to space lines, but my point was that longer ascender/descender always increase the 'white' between the lines, that in turn can make the text more legible, or readable (I don't know why I introduced the early printers leading problem).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I think we agree, and I didn't make myself clear enough. I do think the whites are very important, just not the exact shapes that they make. An exception is very bold faces, where figure and ground start to be ambiguous.

Frutiger said (p. 217 of Typefaces. The Complete Works), "The realization that the balance of the counters was responsible for the actual beauty of a type face was, for me, a revelatory experience."

I don't think I can go far as Frutiger on the the balance of counters being *wholly* responsible for "beauty". But the balance of counters (letter spaces included) is astounding important, and a fundamental insight on type design. 

When it comes to designing, for example a swash stroke, the beauty of the shape of the black is more important than the shape of the white ground that it cuts through. That's because it is "read", more than the white.

Both black and white are important. I think what's very interesting here, and what John's (Quadibloc's) post raised, is that what is important in the white and the black are different. The eye-brain combo handles them differently, so the designer is better off doing so as well. </div>

There is good evidence that we perceptually distinguish figure and ground and that we give preference to figure as shape. Indeed, given our narrow field of focus and the need to identify shapes against backgrounds, it shouldn't surprise us that we treat figure and ground differently. Yes, the figure is defined relative to the ground, but that is not the same thing as suggesting that figure and ground are <em>perceptually</em> equal.</div>

But they perceptually create each-other! There is no equality, one requires the other to exist.  If you choose to call that "superiority" that is your choice.  If you take away the one you feel has the "inferior" role, then the other more superior one also disappears.</div>

No, they don't perceptually do anything. <em>We</em> do things perceptually.

We see figures that are defined by contrast with ground: the stronger the contrast, the more defined we say that a figure is. The role of the ground in perception of the figure is to contrast with the figure; the shape of the ground is not like the shape of the figure, because what we recognise is the shape of the figure, not the shape of the ground. This is why we have notions of figure and ground, and not merely of positive and negative. Remember that reading is unusual in that figure and ground are on the same focal plane; but I see no reason to think that this changes the dynamic by which we perceive the shape of the figure against as ground that is ignored. The ground has to be there in order to make perception of the figure possible, but that is not the same thing as saying that the ground is perceived in the same way as the figure. And I'm perfectly comfortable characterising this as giving perceptual precedence to the figure.</div>

Fine, make this about semantics or philosophy if you want to stray away and ignore the concept completely. Just rewrite the statement in any way with the euphemism of your choice to cloud the issue instead of confronting it.  We are talking about perception! If you remove the perception of the ground then you remove the perception of the figure.  The perception of the one is created by the perception of the other. 

"I predict that almost everyone -- especially non-type designers -- will paint a white A on a black"

So what! I am not talking about paint.  Sure they would.  They can paint the A with 2 strokes that way and they would need many more to paint out the background with any color.  Pick any 2 colors, one for figure and one for ground. Another way to look at it is to give them a smooth wooden board and a chisel and hammer.  Most people would cut away the thing we call the figure much the same way ancient Greeks and Romans carved letters into stone.  By so doing, they are removing some part of the ground to reveal the figure--oh and both are the same "color," wood. The glass is half full--the glass is half empty. ;-)
This is not about efficient writing it is about seeing.

No, you don't perceptually do anything. You do things semantically.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, maybe John's thought experiment is not very persuasive, but surely we do "do things" perceptually. Our visual cortex and brain has an extremely active process for extracting figures and objects from a visual field. 

It has been shown by studying cat's optic nerves and brains that the visual cortex starts by identifying edges. And at the end of the process there is not a reproduction of exactly what is "out there." This shown by optical illusions, and these are important in type, as you well know--the overshoot on round letters to look the same as square ones, dividing letters above the middle to look equal etc., etc. The brain is contributing a lot to what we see, and it seems to treat figure and ground differently. 

That is the point John S. was making above:that we usually don't identify shapes in the ground. I am grateful for it—Thanks John S.! It identifies something that has bothered me for a long time about the idea of "designing the whites", without my being able to put my finger on it. 

An example is the "arrow" in the Fedex logo. People usually don't see it until it's pointed out. How much a subliminal effect it has is open to debate, but if it were a black arrow everyone would see it right away. Hence, to me John S.'s point is made.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris: <em>If you remove the perception of the ground then you remove the perception of the figure. The perception of the one is created by the perception of the other.</em>

What can you mean by ‘remove the perception of the ground’? Let's say that you mean remove the contrast between the ground and the figure, because it is the contrast that enables us to perceive the difference between the two and hence perceive the recognisable shape. [The alternative would be to somehow remove the perception itself, i.e. mess with someone's eyes or brain.] Diminishing the contrast obscures the figure relative to the ground, and if the contrast is removed completely then we could say that the figure is completely obscured, and hence not available to be perceived. Perception of the figure relies upon contrast with the ground, but that doesn't say anything at all about perception of the ground. To say that 'removing the perception of the ground removes the perception of the figure', by which I understand you to mean remove the contrast between them so that the one cannot be distinguished from the other, is simply a truism. So what? It doesn't say anything about the process by which, given sufficient contrast, we perceive and recognise the figure. Nothing at all. It certainly doesn't imply that the figure shape is not hierarchically preferenced in our perception, or that we do not habitually ignore shapes in the ground.

<em>No, you don't perceptually do anything. You do things semantically.</em>

Of course we do things perceptually, and much of what we do in terms of semantics, when we assign meaning to what we perceive, is dependent on and subsequent to perception. Where else do you think perception resides if not in our visual cortex and our brains? Perception is not a quality of the object perceived. And I am not being euphemistic or trying to ‘cloud the issue instead of confronting it’, I am trying to be precise -- anything but euphemistic -- and not to play fast and loose with words and concepts. Far from trying to avoid confronting ‘the issue’, I am saying that there is no issue in what you say, only a poorly worded truism.</div>

I would not be surprised if people who can't hear have more of a difficulty reading and writing then those who can hear (even if I haven't noticed anything firsthand to suggest that), since the alphabet is inherently phonetic and to a lesser degree orthographic. 

Which brings me to the "Word Superiority" in Arabic. Whether it's an unfamiliar word (it could be familiar to hear, or to read in Latin, but unfamiliar in the Arabic script) or whether it's a bad handwriting or a really nice and ornamental piece of calligraphy I find my self spelling it out phonetically decoding the individual letters before understanding and reading the word. Same thing happens in English when you read the name of the Icelandic volcano or shorthand or overly done logos. Reading in Arabic is very similar to reading in English, there's somewhat of a difference in writing.

The major building block of reading an alphabet is recognizing individual letters and then seeing them in context to figure out how they're pronounced and then seeing them in pairs and then in groups. Therefore letter recognition is much more important than word recognition and this is exactly why type designers will sometimes design words or pairs of letters, because they don't want the r to look like an n or the v to touch the a in case that slows down the recognition of any of the letters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As designers we often need to train ourselves to see the ground in ways that we wouldn't naturally. This is why we do things like turn the letterforms upside down, invert them, concentrate deliberately on the white space, squint to blur the forms, etc.

I wonder if some of our focus on figure/ground is an artefact of our need as designers to override the perceptual shortcuts our mind takes as we process visual information. Think of the first graders' art lesson where the teacher reveals with a ruler that the eyes are not, in fact, positioned at the top of the head but in the middle.

I recently heard a great interview with Chuck Close, the famous photorealist painter where he described his struggles with a condition called "face blindness". Apparently a small fraction of the population doesn't have the specialized wiring in the brain connected with facial recognition. This makes it almost impossible to distinguish people by their faces. I wondered if his ability to dispassionately observe the contours of the face contributed to his photorealistic portraits.</div>

Thank you, John. You just proved my point. Your gift with semantics serves you well. Instead of making a respectable argument, you just attack the source of disagreement.

Yes, but there are pieces of the brain that are doing things to signals from the eyes before they're passed on to the other parts of the brain in which our conscious minds reside.
So while the brain doesn't have a mind of its own, it does do things on its own apart from what we do with our own minds.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">“we […] don't identify shapes in the ground” [Bill et. al.]

Perhaps, but in the letter “o” the size of the counter and the roundness of its expression on both the left and right have tremendous cue-value. This is augmented by the full closedness of the ring-like black that contains it. 

Now take the letter “n”. The size of the counter and the greater squareness of its expression to the left and right, as well as it's lack of containment at the bottom have critical cue value. This is augmented by the bilateral disparity, lack of closure at the bottom, and conjunctivity of and in the black that contains it.

I can devise similar statements for other letters.

Perception — or better, feature-analytic processing — relies on cues.

At the level of distinctive features it does not matter if the cues are provided by the black or provide by the white, by what is “figure” or what is “ground”.

Perceptual discrimination affordance or visibility relies on a differentiation between “figure” and “ground,” but in feature analytic processing, both the black and white are used.

There have been studies to determine what things have cue value. I don’t have them at my finger tips, and I don’t remember their exact content, but I know my impression about the whites comes in part from having had a look at them.</div>

We may not have an agreed upon name for these shapes, true; We may not consciously attend to these shapes to the degree that we would if they were an agreed upon object, true; That does not mean that they do not play a role in our perception of the agreed upon figure.  Look at a script that is completely foreign to you, one that you cannot read or even know what the glyphs are.  To me, the negative shapes in Arabic, Indic, and Asian scripts are fascinating beyond belief because I am not encumbered by  "knowing the code". I am free to just see shapes as they have evolved over time and as they vary from one scribe to the next. I fear that the day I can read these scripts will be the day I lose this phenomenal joy.</div>

For there to be a refutation the account must develop a conjecture about what produces the effect that makes new or different testable predictions than another model.

I can imagine that interactive activation theorist may invoke some external explanation, not intrinsic to the scheme, but this makes the model weak, especially in the face of a model in which the slowing is expected on intrinsic-to-the model grounds.</div>

You could argue, as in my article on readability, that to identify letters we need regular rhythm, and with mixed case rhythm is disrupted. Then you could test this explanation by mixing lower case with similar stretching to caps. I would expect a similar stretching would not slow reading down as much as mixing in the caps.    </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Derek Besnera -- Abstract: 

A common assumption in the reading literature is that function words are often identified wholly or in part on the basis of outline shape and/or word-specific visual pattern. This assumption was examined in three perceptual identification experiments, a speeded oral reading experiment, and in a lexical decision task where the visual pattern of function words and control items (content words, non-words and control strings) was systematically distorted by cAsE alTeRnA-tIoN. In all five experiments distortion failed to impair performance more on functors than on various control items. This result is argued to be inconsistent with the view that outline shape and word-specific visual pattern typically play a role in the identification of isolated function words. 

Shape distortion impaired function words less than controls in perceptual identification, but impaired function and content words equally in speeded naming and lexical decision. These contrasting effects of shape distortion are discussed in terms of a distinction between the uptake of information (lexical access) and phenomenal perception.

		<div class="commentbody">WSVP (Word-Specific Visual Pattern)

Derek Besner [1989]: that is, (a) visual information that might span letters (e.g. the shape of the spaces between letters) and / or (b) visual information that forms part of the feature list that specifies a word without recourse to letter identification (e.g., components of letters).

In a chapter to the 1991 book <em>Lexical Representation and Process</em> [ed., William Marslen-Wilson] Besner and James C. Johnston explain that these features could be “the set of all component strokes in the proper arrangement, or they might be more exotic aspects, such as junctions between strokes, the shape of spaces between letters, or any other property of the pattern.”

So on this view the visual information that might be used in word identification is the “entire set of visual features in a word,” collectively constituting “a word-specific visual pattern or WSVP.”

David Berlow asks “[a]nd what does Besner mean by “none.”” Aye, there’s the rub. In the case of the WSVP it’s at best a qualified “none”. I actually laid down a 35 spot to find this out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">More about the NONE:

‘The careful reader will have noted that words are more impaired than non-words by format distortion in Experiment 5. At first glance this seems to offer support for some form of wholistic analysis. This result is not new, however, and is discussed at length in Besner (1983), Besner & McCann (1987), and Besner and Johnston (1989) where it is argued to reflect a form of wholistic recognition, as opposed to wholistic idenrification.

Note that the word “identified” is used in Besner's title.

We get an idea of what the wholistic [Besner’s spelling] recognition versus wholistic identification entails from the following: “Deleterious effects of case alternation may arise in part after abstract letter identities have been computed and an attempt is made to integrate abstract orthographic information with the original sensory pattern so as to afford a linguistically interpreted phenomenal percept (Besner, 1983).

The idea is that in the uptake of visual information case mixing doesn’t affect performance, but in the formation of a stable percept it does. The Perea / Rosa paper explores this further but also makes the following claim about Besner: “[…] the multiple-process model of Besner and Johnston (1989) predicts that when the visual format is familiar, lexical decision responses could be made on the basis of “word-specific visual pattern information” (i.e., it would reflect a form of holistic recognition, as opposed to holistic word identification, as in the Allen et al., 1995, model). However, when the format is unfamiliar (e.g., alternating-size stimuli), participants will ordinarily use the letter-level routes (i.e., the orthographic familiarity assessment process or the unique identification of the word).

Lexical decision responses are no / yes responses when the subject is asked to decide if the presented letter-sequence is a word (using short exposure times). This is “wholistic recognition,” as opposed to identification.

So the NONE relies on a distinction between recognition, which can rely on word-specific visual pattern, and identification, which can’t.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, the full story is even more complex — to complex for here. Solving the conundrum provided by mixed results for mixed case also drives Besner to also assume alternating case affects the identification of single letters, which isn't such a bad result, considering.

17.50 minus or plus the exchange rate? Do I get to choose the date to my advantage? We're about at par now.</div>

Besner rejected it. 

The phrase was picked up recently here:
http://l2c2.isc.cnrs.fr/publications/files/Nazir%20and%20Huckauf%202008.pdf

IMHO WSVP is OK iff V becomes more RULI and P becomes 2D

RULI = <em>role-unit level</em> information

D = distributions (and they're of two kinds: <em>local</em>, i.e., at salient centres; and <em>global</em>, i.e., across the bounded map of <em>role-unit level</em> information)

More at a later date.</div>
