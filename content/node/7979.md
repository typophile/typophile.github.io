body: I know you&#39;ve all ID&#39;d GQ fonts in the past, but I couldn&#39;t find
  a thread with some type names for Woodward&#39;s latest incarnation. I think the
  body is still Miller ... Any takers on the rest?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/55031.jpg"

  body: I just picked up a GQ the other day for the sole purpose of looking at the
    type - no really. The headline looks like Fountain&#39;s Borgstrand - <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/borgstrand.asp"

  body: The odd thing about GQ&#39;s use of Miller is that it almost looks they&#39;re
    using the display weight for body copy. You can&#39;t really tell from the scan
    Jason posted, but in print it looks lighter than the everyday text weight of Miller
    I use. The spacing is looser than you&#39;d expect, too.
