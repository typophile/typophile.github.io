body: I am currently working on a B2B logo which will appear as a three letter acronym,
  for a government backed Import business and am trying to identify simple and clear
  typefaces that would suit this. The main clients are logistic companies and corporations
  who import huge en masse. The logo will be used on everything, through print to
  TV. The companies main attributes are that of Speed, Efficiency and Growth. Does
  anything spring to mind that could help me out? I will also develop some form of
  device to support this acronym.
