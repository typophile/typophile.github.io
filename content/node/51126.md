body: "Hi. I'm sorry if this is the wrong section, but I have been a long time lurker
  here and usually have my answers solved by searching or reading other peoples posts.\r\n\r\nI
  have the font set LTR Federal from letterror. (http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/federal_shop1.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  is my first time with opentype fonts and I am trying to learn. \r\n\r\nIn his description
  and instructions, he advises:\r\n\r\nThis is best done in some sort of graphics
  application, like Illustrator or Freehand. Create an object with the text, size
  and location you need. Select one of the four optical sizes, for instance Eighteen
  Line (as in this diagram), then choose the one of the drop-shadow shadings: named
  HShadow for the horizontal shade lines and DShadow for diagonal shadelines. Set
  the font color for the Shadow layer. \r\n\r\nThis is simple enough, but I cannot
  seem to find the \"drop shadow shadings\" he mentions, hshadow, etc... I have tried
  in Freehand, Illustrator, and PS CS3. I am so lost on how to achieve the affects
  he has made with these fonts. I understand layering and using photoshop, but I cannot
  figure out where I am to find dshadow etc. \r\n\r\nPlease advise, because I would
  much like to use these fonts, and can't until I solve this. Thanks to everyone.\r\n"

  body: "What exactly do you want to do with OpenType?\r\n\r\nDo you want to convert
    your outlines of characters, with the various effects from different programs,
    and import them into a font editor to produce an OpenType font to use in MS Word
    or Adobe InDesign to produce your desired results?\r\n\r\nTo do so, you must think
    outside of the box.\r\n\r\nA typical font editor can not produce the same effects
    that your can create in Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, or Freehand. Rather, a
    good flexible font editor can make a font which creates characters that look like
    the desired results you showed in your link.\r\n\r\nLike most people, you think
    that OpenType is the key to almost everything. \r\n\r\nOpenType is merely a new
    sophisticated font format, used by many font editors. Most font editors can not
    offer all the advanced features of OpenType. Maybe in another 5 years. Maybe 10.
    Maybe never. \r\n\r\nMicroSoft and Adobe have created advanced tools to harness
    much of OpenType. One is called VOLT; one is called a tool kit. Each is not intuitive
    and easy to use. \r\n\r\nTo succeed, you must know its capabilities and limitations.
    Then, think of a way to achieve your goal with those limited capabilities. That's
    thinking outside of the box.\r\n\r\nOver a decade ago, I created a font with characters
    like those that appear in your link. I did it in Fontographer, now from FontLab
    at www.fontlab.com by creating all the different graphic shaded elements as different
    characters. Then, I pasted composites of them in different character locations
    for the alphabet. The solid black or white elements I drew in those locations.
    \r\n\r\nEven though it looked like a mess, after I created a PostScript font,
    it printed as desired. PostScript fonts in those days did not render on the screen
    until after Apple and MicroSoft came out with TrueType, ad then Adobe followed
    with Adobe Type Manager.\r\n\r\nToday, we have MicroSoft and Adobe offering OpenType.
    I won't get into the advantages of OpenType over TrueType, but it's only time
    for Apple to offer a new font format, code-named, \"Bric-or-Brac\", or Everything-You-Could-ImagineType.
    I got a beta. Boy, it makes OpenType look like rotten tuna fish!"

  body: "sk1n_w4lk3r,\r\n\r\nthe various shading parts for Federal are all in separate
    fonts. The Federal fonts are released in OpenType format, but layering and color
    effects are not OpenType features. You need to do some assembly.\r\n\r\nIf you
    install all the fonts from your download, you should have the following items
    in your font menu:\r\n\r\n> Federal\r\n> FederalSix\r\n> FederalNine\r\n> FederalTwelve\r\n>
    FederalEighteen\r\n> FederalReserveNote\r\n\r\nThe first, Federal, is the font
    with the regular, unshaded forms. Use this to set the initial text and get the
    size and position right.\r\nThe numbered entries, Six, Nine, Twelve and Eighteen
    Line are sets of shades with different levels of detail. \r\n\r\nFor instance,
    in the Eighteen menu you will find 5 fonts with shades and parts for the 18 line
    version:\r\n> Bevel\r\n> DShadow\r\n> Diagonal\r\n> HShadow\r\n> Horizontal\r\n\r\nBevel
    is the three dimensional looking body. It makes the letters appear as if cut out.
    \r\nDShadow contains the diagonal (D) shading for the shadow. This fits behind
    the bevel.\r\nHShadow is the same, but now horizontal lines.\r\nDiagonal and Horizontal
    contain the shading for inside the letters. These need to go on top. \r\n\r\nYour
    download also includes a FederalManual.pdf in which the layering process is shown
    step by step.\r\nThe Sample Art folder contains 4 illustrator documents with lots
    and lots of examples of layered words in all sorts of different combinations and
    color schemes.\r\n\r\nIf you can't find these files, send me the order number
    off-list and I will send you a new set.\r\nCheers, Erik\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Erik,\r\n\r\nthanks! I'll look through for all my info, and see whats there.
    I actually ordered these a long time ago through my company, and just got the
    chance to use them for the first time, so I will look around for all the info.\r\n\r\nThanks
    to both for your advice. When I installed the fonts, I do have \r\n\r\n> Federal\r\n>
    FederalSix\r\n> FederalNine\r\n> FederalTwelve\r\n> FederalEighteen\r\n> FederalReserveNote\r\n\r\nshowing
    up, but I don't have  a \"menu\" for like federal18... I don't know where it would
    be, in any of the programs, but I'm assuming it's where it would usually say \"italic\"
    \"bold\" etc.... and they aren't there... I must have installed them improperly.
    \r\n\r\nI just went through windows fonts, clicked install new font, and located
    the OTF folder and installed the fonts there. Was there more I was supposed to
    do??\r\n\r\nI'll have to look for my order number... I'm not sure if I still have
    the info, it has been a long time and my company has changed around a lot as of
    late, meaning i don't know if the info is still on their servers.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help so far.\r\n\r\nEric"

    font menu are you looking? Which operating system?\r\nIf you like, send me the
