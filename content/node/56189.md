body: "so, this project was called \"ekphrasis\". we, the students, had to produce
  ekphrastic [graphic description of a visual work of art] representation of a chosen
  site of a New Orleans neighborhood. For one of the two compositions, we had to transform
  our visual experience into a textual experience. \r\n\r\nthe ekphrasis that i have
  posted is my visual ekphrasis of the house of blues. i took a picture of it, pen
  tooled it in illustrator, printed it out, put tracing paper on it, hand lettered
  words, scanned in the tracing paper, pen tooled the words, then combined them. the
  result is by far my favorite project that i have ever created--and i thought i'd
  like to share it with all of you! its attatched! enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
