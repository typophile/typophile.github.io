  and some cool printing techniques to make some fancy cards. I know there was a thread
  lying around that was talking about new techniques (anyone got the link?)\r\n\r\nPersonally
  I like really smooth matte cards that feel like nice book covers, thick gsm stock
  (though maybe not for this particular card) UV Printing, Die cuts for rounded corners...\r\n\r\nFor
  this project (oh its for Dolce Vita Day Spa :P) I am thinking a card like Nordstroms
  or something, It will need some metalic for the logo, but the rest is up in the
  air. Hopefully I can get the clients to spend and get some really nice cards. So
  let me know any techniques you think may be cool for this one. \r\n\r\nAlso the
  clients were wondering about stock that looks sort of like a cracked marble surface
  or something for the letterheads and maybe business cards. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Jesse"

    customer screams more when they really want less. Your job is to really sell a
    good solid design that will be cost effective for them over time. The more elaborate
    ideas you described that they want will get pretty expensive and they would be
    tied to the printer/paper manufacturer. Good design will make you more money,
    while allowing the customer flexibility in producing good design. I am not saying
    to skimp on quality printing or paper.\r\n\r\nOh heck, make the typophiles happy
    and have the customer spend money on fonts that will really differentiate them
    from the competition.\r\n \r\nThe Truth shall set you free"

    a print shop that does, that's the best place to start -- look for what they think
    they want, and design around it.\r\n\r\nOf course, you should also look for what
    they need in a paper, and design for it.  Present both, and the rationale, and
    then move on."

    for <em> stock that looks sort of like a cracked marble surface or something</em>
    you may get better results by photographing and printing such a surface rather
    than relying on a paper or card stock to imitate it. I used to do paint effects
    like marbling and wood graining, and you can get a lot more control over the end
    result that way."

  body: "years ago, we did this logo on a business card for the client:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jouletechnologies.com/\r\n\r\nWe
    embossed the 'J' globe. Nothing fancy, but apparently it was a huge hit, with
    lots of 'oohs' and 'ahs' when they handed it out.\r\n\r\nI also have a bit of
    a crush on the cheesy thermo-printed fake-embossing that you can get at places
    like Kinkos. It's that rubber raised ink. I always wanted to do a card that had
    a heavy amount of that ink on the front.\r\n\r\nI also agree with Rodrigue. In
    this day of 4-color double-sided glossy business cards for $100 per 10000, what
    stands out moreso is typically 'less'. Often, just using a sturdy, quality card
    stock is enough to invoke a good impression on someone."

    It's a German paper, it comes in a good range of colors, is made in text and cover
    weights and prints real nice. However, it is no longer available in Canada. It
    might still be available in the U.S."

    have very little, as in none, in the the paper swatch department. I plan on stopping
    by a few paper suppliers later today to see what they have. But I am not very

    what do you consider a sturdy, quality card stock?\r\n\r\nBen, thanks for the

  body: Yeah, that Elephanthide is damned elusive now. It, and other Zander papers,
    used to be readily available in North America. It was distributed by Unisource.
    I tried to get some last year, to use as a flysheet, and was told it was not longer
    available in Canada. My paper rep thought there might be some in the States but
    we never pursued it. I ended up going with a Reich Paper product called 'Shine'.
    Shine isn't marble. But it's pretty. (Reich Paper also makes a translucent.)

  body: "<em>How did you achieve the paint effects?</em>\r\n\r\nTraditionally these
    techniques involve underpainting in a base colour and then applying successive
    washes or glazes of broken colour over the top. Different tools (rags, sponges,
    feathers, specialist brushes) are used to break or figure the colour according
    to what kind of texture is to be achieved. Further layers of coloured glazes and
    varnishes add tinted but translucent depth to the finish. It was a pretty labour
    intensive traditional craft, that had a revival during the 80s and early 90s,
    but these days it can be successfully mimicked in PhotoShop if one has the time
    and patience.\r\n\r\nTo my lasting regret I once left behind a quantity of embossed
    and coloured 'antelope hide' paper in a house move. I think it came from a bookbinders
    suppliers."
