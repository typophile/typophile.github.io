body: "Unicode points 2090\u20132094 are described as subscript a, e, o, x and schwa.
  The official Unicode chart says nothing about the usage of those glyphs, and I can't
  seem to find information on them elsewhere. Can anyone shed some light on this?"

  body: Subscript e is used to indicate eletrons and also in Euler notation for derivatives.
    Subscripts a, e, and x are used in logarithms.

  body: 'Than you ever so much, David. Much appreciated. I really should have known
    this! (May I be redeemed by the fact that my two typefaces in the works already
    support reconstructed Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Norse, and have stylistic
    sets for Transcribed Gothic.) '
