  I lower the height of a stem, by highlighting the upper nodes and drag it down a
  little bit. Or by hand move a nod little to the left.\r\n\r\nCould I just repeat
  this last \"session\" in some way?"

  body: "\r\nHey, that's a good idea. Simply allow redo even if you are at the end
    of the history. But I do not think it is possible. You should post your suggestion
    to the official FL forum on msn.\r\n\r\nIn case it is just shifting nodes you
    want to repeat I suggest to use the transformation panel, which \"remembers\"
    the action. This should do what you want to do."

  body: "Thanks, in this case I believe the transformation panel will do, but I would
    die for a global \"repeat last session\" that remembers anything you do \u2013
    just like in Illustrator, but even more advanced.\r\n\r\nLets say you convert
    a sharp connection to a smooth, or whatever, then had a quick command to repeat
    it, it would Rock! :)\r\n"

    by double-clicking on a node. That is quite quick (if you use a mouse). \r\n\r\nA."
