body: "The RoboFab developers would like to invite you to a new Robothon conference,
  Thursday March 5 and Friday March 6, 2009, at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague.\r\n\r\nThis
  time around we want to focus on the type design and production workflow. Sessions
  will address drawing, managing sources, class kerning, interpolation and generating
  and testing OTF. And of course scripting to glue it all together. We'd like to have
  some tool demo's as well. And of course a couple of parties, people to meet and
  letters to look at.\r\n\r\nThere will be other type related events at the same time
  and venue: an exhibition of the work of Tobias Frere-Jones will open Friday afternoon,
  \ and the new winner of the Gerrit Noordzij Award will be presented.\r\n\r\nRegistration
  info and programme will be  posted on [[http://Robofab.com]]\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nErik"

    to get started, or will the sessions be targeted at advanced programming?

    Shu Lai, plus Yves and Lolo and Type-o-Tones and so many more Typophiles! The
    SOTA crew is staying in a lovely apartment off Denneweg, can't wait to get back
    to Dutch goodness.
