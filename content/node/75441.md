  movie footage and I really want to be able to type in some Chinese characters in
  Illustrator or After Effects without having to enable a foreign language on Windows.
  \ Yes, PC's suck, whatever.  Does anyone know of a (free) symbol font I could use?
  \ It doesn't really matter if it looks cheesy, within reason of course.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: For Illustrator, you should be able to 'type' the characters by selecting
    them from the Glyph palette with a Chinese font selected. Not sure about AE.
