  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I haven't done much environmental design, so I'm not sure about this one:

I have to pick a typeface for vinyl lettering to go in a street-facing window. The art area is huge — about 6 feet by very tall — but the sentence has to be readable on the sidewalk and I don't know, across the street?

The sentences, about one each per window, are memories about the history of an area in the city, winning contest submissions. They'll also be part of an inside exhibit, and later a book. So history, first person voices, collective memory, lyric-poetry type stuff.

I like the feel of Filosofia and Mrs Eaves italics for this, even ITC Century roman — but the first 2 are definitely not strong enough for across the street viewing. I need something strong and quirky. With multiple weights?

Suggestions?</div>

I saw a window installation I liked the other day,  the whole window was frosted glass and the type itself was left clear with a lot of negative space around it. Similar dimensions to your's as well, 6x6 Feet and the text was set in about 900pt.

		<div class="commentbody">Something slightly condensed with a large x-height is going to work in your favor. Consider the average height of a viewer/cars and other obstructions and placement/visibility above this level, contrast of the color in relation to the coatings/color of the glass and how the color of the glass can change based on viewing position. Sometimes a pearlized reflective vinyl can shift from neg. to reverse as the sun sets and the environment changes.

Folowing Dave's direction, you could look at Lucida Fax. I've used Apex new in a similar situation, but I was following the lead of an existing book design.</div>

Just please avoid a Didot-like face. Those ultra delicate serifs are a bitch, even at large sizes. If someone asks me to weed the "Burberry" logo at 1 inch tall again, I'm gonna scream.

The problem with something as easy to work with as Gotham or Trade Gothic is they don't relate to the content in any way. But I hear you on the contrast point .. deadline approaching, still have to figure out who in this organization (#$*&^) will actually get on a ladder and whether it is in their collective agreement.

Vonnes Black condensed. Chunky, space-conscious but clear, with some 1950-ish  quirks. Proofed and taped up, passed the angled walk-by and across the street tests. Not the best thing I've ever done, not my favourite typeface in the world, but I can live with it here. 

Here's a snip. 

thanks everyone for chipping in.

		<div class="commentbody">Not to be a party-pooper, but just the old typesetter in me - since this is a quote by M.J. Florczak

1. Should there not be periods after the M and the J as they might stand for a first and middle name - or was he/she like Grant whose middle name was S - no punctuation needed?
2. Since this is a quote - should we have quote marks around it?
3. Since MJ is the source - it should be a 1/m dash - with no space between the 1/m and the MJ

and while I'm on it - since the second line has all that white space, it should be alright to move the source of the quote up one line. If this is large for display, and you want to fill three lines, I'd like to recommend then centering the source. Just a design thing.

Otherwise, it's done! And fine! And probably hanging up somewhere already. My comments are just comments...</div>

The client liked it so much we're adding 2 additional panels, and once they're installed I'll photograph and post the thing as it looks on the street.

I think many of your concerns about my choices will make sense seeing it in place. But some of the typographic things are also style decisions, yes? Like APA and MLA; no periods after initials are a decision to stick to out of a need for fewer extraneous bits.
