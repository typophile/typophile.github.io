  midst of reworking an old identity and the logo is giving me fits. One of those
  things where I've been at it so long I can't think straight about it anymore.\r\n\r\nHere
  are some of the things going on:\r\n\r\n1. Since the same is a bit odd, I wanted
  to go with a simple type-only logo.\r\n2. I wanted to increase the readability of
  the name by visually separating \"Eureka\" from \"ville\".\r\n\r\nI'm down to these.
  Some I like, some I'm not sure about. I'd like your comments and thoughts. Don't
  be kind, if they suck, let me know (I have not kerned these yet). \r\n\r\nGroup

  body: "I think 11 (at least that sort of direction) is the best. It definately seems
    to hit on all levels you were aiming for. Having \"eureka\" slightly higher also
    is a nice play on the word and emotion usually associated with it. However, splitting
    the bottom copy \"advertising & design\" creates an easy feeling being split like
    that (and it doesn't help that I can't think of anything right now to suggest
    about that.\r\n\r\nI also like some of the typ treatments you are getting in group
    a, particularly 3,5,and 6. I think, though, that you could push the contrast in
    weight a bit more (if the typeface weights allow). \r\n... _._. ... .. ... __..

  body: "Group A definitely looks most elegant. I'd forget group B. But truth be told
    group D (logo 11) has a nice twist that promises the most.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest
    you try combining groups A and D. Put \"Eureka Ville\" in a green square with
    a twist. The square will grow in height a bit. And \"advertising & design\" outside
    if you need it.\r\n\r\nThe choice of colour is very very good for group A. It
    makes it very elegant. The same colour doesn't work as good in other groups.\r\n\r\nWe'll
    see about the fonts later."

    travel posters - as does the word \"Eureka\" - so I think the design is very cohesive.\r\n\r\n-Scott"

    13!!! I just noticed that. Group D 11 = 13."

  body: I like the C 11 most, but the other 11 is a good start, too. I'm a bit bothered
    about the two levels of advertising & design text, though

  body: "At times when i have lots of choices I try to reduce the amount of choices
    to find the best solution. \r\nI would suggest eliminating #5 as the lc \"e''
    is too awkward and the \"ville\" is too thin,and overall balance is poor. placement
    at the bottom of the box where it touches the white below.\r\n\r\nThe lc \"k\"
    in 10 is weak as well, not sure what font it is but amateurish at best. I do however
    like the idea of at least one font being rounded (apparently trendy these days).\r\n\r\nWhich
    is best - I don't know. 11 which several folks like is a bit too standard for
    my taste. Neutra is simply too common in my opinion. If you like something with
    an architectural history try Frank Lloyd Wright's Midway font (designed for Midway
    Gardens), or better yet design your own.\r\n\r\nAs Lex recommended, you need to
    consider a mark/icon.\r\n\r\nAll this advise is pointless unless we know exactly
    what type of work you do and who your clients are. \r\n\r\nLikewise going with
    any of the choices the use Neutraface if your clients are all high tech companies
    may not be a good idea as the retro 40's feeling will not be appropriate. "
