  \r\n[[http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/classifications.html]]\r\n\r\n\"Since a
  Parisian printer created the first in 1643, script typefaces...\"\r\n\r\nDid that
  first script type receive a name?\r\n\r\nA quick gooogle indicates the Adobe material
  has been regurgitated without reverence...\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated."

    In an event, <em>Encyclop\xE6dia of Type Faces</em> credits the first French cursive
    to Robert Granjon of Lyons in 1557, and asserts that Morris Fuller Benton's <strong>Civilit\xE9</strong>
    is a faithful rendering of same."

  body: both. I can't really imagine such a thing in metal, perhaps the first flowing
    script?

  body: My guess is that they refer to Pierre Moreau who, according to <a href="http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/history.html">Luc
    Devroye's page</a> on the history of type "endeavoured to cut printing types in
    the style of handwriting". He gives a link to a <a href="http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/imrereiner/imrereiner-ornament3-pierremoreau1643.jpg">scan
    of his cripts and ornaments from 1643</a>.
