body: When kerning fonts with both Lining and Oldstyle proportional numerals what
  is the generally accepted form when it comes to kerning? Are all numbers kerned
  with every other glyph or is it best just to kern 0-9 with all punctuation and parenteses/brackets/braces
  only? Interested to hear thoughts. Thanks.

  body: "The only time I see numerals kerned with \"every other glyph\" is when class
    kerning has been used. Usually poorly.\r\n\r\nRemember that \"lining\" is another
    name for \"uppercase\" (& \"oldstyle\" for \"lowercase\"). If you don't have small
    cap figures, the oldstyle will usually be selected when small caps with numbers
    are set. Make sure your oldstyle figs work with them, and if that destroys the
    look of the them, add small cap figures.\r\n\r\nAnd I would say remember to check
    the comma and period with your tabular numerals. I frequently wind up adding a
    comma.lt and peroid.lt to switch in -- usually works for with tabular oldstyle
    numerals, too. And If you're really careful, you might want to have slightly different
    numerals for tabular figures... \r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "I'd assume they should be kerned with alphabetics, punctuation, mathematical
    signs and the word space (and of course with other numerals). At least I always
    feel happier when fonts include those kerning pairs, especially if I've paid a
    lot for them.\r\n\r\nAgree with Charles, tabular numerals should be slightly different,
    and smallcap numerals are often indispensable."

  body: "I'm not a type designer but I would probably kern everything with everything,
    if you're releasing a font into the wild for general use. Never doubt that someone's
    going to want to write 6a = b, Section 12c, l33t, 221b Baker St, a 501(c)(3) organization,
    c u l8r, a 1p6 gutter, map coordinates 18f, smith38@yahoo.com, manuscript leaf
    18r, and license plate T42N24T.\r\n\r\nHowever I can't think of any circumstances
    where you'd mix lining and oldstyle numerals within the same word, so you can
    probably skip kerning the two sets of numerals <em>to each other</em>."

  body: You should certainly *inspect* all the combinations mentioned. If your glyphs
    are well-fitted, however, you should have to *kern* relatively few of these, mostly
    punctuation.
