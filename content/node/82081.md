body: "The Tsukurimashou project is now <a HREF=\"http://sourceforge.jp/projects/tsukurimashou/simple/\">hosted
  on SourceForge.JP</a>, and recently made a new release.  At this point, coverage
  includes Latin, katakana and hiragana, and 349 kanji including all of the Grade
  One and half of the Grade Two kanji taught in the Japanese school system.  I figure
  I'm on track to have the full basic character set of roughly 2500 kanji, in a year
  or two.  Note that since version 0.2, it has full proportional spacing and kerning
  of Latin (not necessarily well demonstrated by the font viewer that produced the
  screenshot below), and so could be taken more seriously for typesetting English
  even though it remains primarily intended for Japanese.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/images/2011-05/20110511tpshot.png\"

    yet.
