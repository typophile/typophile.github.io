  body: "Certain details, like the E, look like a Goudy typeface, such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/goudy-old-style-mt/?refby=bowfin|Goudy
    Old Style]], but I wasn't able to find a full match. The J seems quite odd with
    such a small, pointed hook. This one is a mystery to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I agree Mike, with Goudy Old Style. The edits for the logo are mostly minor.
    As for the J, the hook seems to have been edited to line up with the first horizontal
    line under JOYNER.\r\nDon"
