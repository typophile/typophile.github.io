body: "I'm a complete newbie at opentype features. Trying to learn as much as I can,
  but there doesn't seem to be that much information on the web for beginners. \r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for an explanation of the logic and basic syntax of class-based kerning.
  Something in the style of this wonderful [[http://ilovetypography.com/OpenType/opentype-features.html|article
  about substitution features]], but for kerning. I would also love any resources
  on specifically doing this with fontforge, but I can figure out this easier if I
  understand what's going on in the background (tables? subtables? what?)\r\n\r\nAny
  pointers will be very much appreciated\r\n"

    Add Lookup\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/111_4879.jpg]\r\nChoose Pair
    position (kerning)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/222_5032.jpg]\r\nIn
    window Kerning format choose Use a matrix of kerning classes\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/333_3417.jpg]\r\nIn
    fields First character I put D and O, and in Second character C G O Q. FontForge
    set the kerning to -110, I changed it to 10.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/444_4720.jpg]\r\nIn
    Kerning Metrics window I wrote OQ\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/555_5269.jpg]\r\nYou
    can change the kern value moving the green line between chosen letters\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/666_3440.jpg]\r\nIn
    window Kerning by classes you can see the result\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/777_6261.jpg]\r\nIn
    window Font information/Lookups/GPOS you can right-click the lookup and choose
    Save Feature File (or only choosen lookup)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/888_6113.jpg]\r\nSaved\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/999_6371.jpg]\r\nThe
    important part of this file looks like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nlookup kernHorizontalKerninginLatinloo
    {\r\n  lookupflag 0;\r\n    @kc0_first_1 = [\\D \\O ];\r\n    @kc0_second_1 =
    [\\C \\G \\O \\Q ];\r\n    pos @kc0_first_1 @kc0_second_1 22;\r\n} kernHorizontalKerninginLatinloo;\r\n\r\nfeature
    kern {\r\n\r\n  script DFLT;\r\n     language dflt ;\r\n      lookup kernHorizontalKerninginLatinloo;\r\n\r\n
    \ script latn;\r\n     language dflt ;\r\n      lookup kernHorizontalKerninginLatinloo;\r\n}
    kern;</pre>\r\n\r\nAs you can see there is one class -left=first- with /D/O and
    one class -right=second- with /C/G/O/Q and the kern value between them is set
    to 22.\r\n"

  body: Wow, Janek, is that FontForge!? (Scratching head -- perhaps I should check
    it again. The interface looks more than a bit improved over the butt-ugly version
    I tried a couple of years ago.)
