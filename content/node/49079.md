body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI am looking for a serif face that works with Avant Garde. Avant
  Garde will be used in headings, (mostly bold and in all caps) but I am looking for
  something a little more refined and readable as body text, as I find Avant Garde
  too hard to work with for this purpose. (It always ends up as a one-trick pony when
  I use it in body) \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I want something a little machined, masculine
  and serious as I am using it in a brochure for outdoor furniture for public places
  (lots of wood and steel). It also has to work well on glossy paper.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: The obvious choice is Lubalin Graph, which is essentially the same as Avant
    Garde with serifs added, but it's still not great for running text. A sturdy slab
    serif like Clarendon might work, depending on the weight and size you use.

  body: I might go for a slab yes, but I was thinking lighter, more delicate than
    both Lubalin and Clarendon

  body: Melior wasn't bad. Is it well behaved on high-gloss paper?
