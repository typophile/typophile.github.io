  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My question is on the old typewriters, before the electric typewriter, when typewriters had fixed type sizes.  Those sizes, if I correctly recall, were "pica" and "elite."  One was 10 pts, and the the other was 12 pts. (I can't remember which was which).

If a form was printed, in those days, that was to be filled out using a typewriter, was the leading when using single spacing on the typewriter equivalent to the values used in modern software (12 pts. for 10 pt type and 14.4 pts. for 12 pt. type)?

If not, does anyone remember the old typewriter single space leading values for those two type sizes?

I tried several searches on this forum, without success.  Perhaps I did not use the correct search criteria.

Thank you.</div>

There was a time when I knew the linespacing value. You can find out yourself: Type a few lines and scan them.

		<div class="commentbody">If I remember correctly (it's been a long time; but I did do a ton of research 'cause I was really curious about all this) - for my Chandler 42 fonts, I measured everything directly from the typewriter and used that for my 10 point master (I was actually trying to do an exact copy of that machine) and the measurements were not consistent with typographic standards.
 
Buried in the back of my head there's a note that says, 'typewriters have different measurements, don't trust them.' 

So measuring them directly would be your best approach, that is a good suggestion.

What I am positive about is each manufacturer had their own standards for developing their 'fonts' - and this was entirely based on their machinery, even the design of the letters themselves were drawn (large, at a drafting table) as one thin stroke, whereas the weight of the metal - when cast - would provide the weight.

Courier's release changed all that. Kinda. It was the first time a typewriter manufacturer decided that there should be a standard.

If memory serves.

		<div class="commentbody">All measures were based on inches: 10 pitch meant 10 characters per inch, 12 — 12 per inch.
Linespacing in the same measure: fractions of an inch. If I recall correctly double spacing meant 2 lines per inch. Single spacing ergo 4 and one-and-a-half = 3.

Please correct me.

And pre. The leading was called platen advance, and it was fixed, usually to six lines per inch. A few systems had the ability to advance a half line, but less than that meant the platen was not on a gear tooth, and was dangerous. 

I can't believe that something as common as the typewriter (my key tool when I was a journalist) is now an antique that people have to recall into memory as to its operation.

I have an Smith Corona Coronet Automatic 12, and while trying to figure out whether it was pica or elite, I came across this neat document on typewriter forensics:

<strong>A Systematic Method for Identifying the Make and Age-Model of a Typewriter from Its Work</strong>
Ordway Hilton

Vol. 41, No. 5 (Jan. - Feb., 1951), pp. 661-674

The PDF isn't publicly available, but my institution has access -- grabbed a couple shots just to give you an idea of what it covers.

		<div class="commentbody">Normal typewriters in the English-speaking world indeed typed 6 lines to the inch (12 point) whether using pica (10 characters to the inch) or elite (12 characters to the inch) characters.

Since single-spaced elite typewriting included, effectively, leading, though, one <em>can</em>, if one wishes, consider elite type to be 10 point type - but if one does so, one should be careful about asserting that as an intrinsic property of the type instead of simply a choice one has personally made, because otherwise it would confuse people (no typewriter advanced 10/72 of an inch after printing a line of elite type).

At least one Swiss company, Hermes, made typewriters that put characters on the page with metric dimensions - 2.5 mm wide characters instead of pica, 2.0 mm wide instead of elite, and 1.5 mm was available for a typestyle called "Economic".

I've seen an office manual typewriter made especially for government work, I believe, that typed 16 characters per inch and 8 lines per inch. And daisywheel typewriters often allowed the use of small 15 character per inch typefaces, since that fit in with the 1/60 inch unit that supported both pica and elite (and which was also often used for proportional spacing).</div>

Except in single spaced lines or what do you mean?  Mechanically: Single spaced 12 pitch is 10 on 12 or so, double spaced 12 pitch was 10 on 20. Digitally: monospaced fonts have all kinds of other measuring and making present to deal with, when the technical and international forces are loosed. 

I think "'points in both dimensions'" to measure monospaced fonts, as an old 'abbot to keep "it" together. ;)

It is certainly true, on the other hand, that digital monospaced fonts come in only one version - and thus they can be in any point size, and their horizontal spacing will decrease proportionately as the point size is adjusted. So if you have a Pica typeface, then the 10-point version will have 12 characters per inch horizontal spacing - but things won't necessarily match up so well.

Incidentally, the Pica version of Courier had basically the same character height as most Elite typefaces on the Selectric. If a digital version of Courier did not include the extra space, the 10 pitch version could therefore have a point size of 10 points instead of 12. But, as you've noted, with digital faces, spacing is often arbitrary. As well, digital faces seem to, at least by default, include considerable built-in leading.</div>
