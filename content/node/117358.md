  body: "Better to buy from Adobe. If there are any differences in the licenses, the
    Adobe license will be in your favor. At this late date, it won't help you with
    modification (for that, the purchase had to be before August 8, 2011), but might
    with font embedding in certain kinds of digital documents. Best to check.\r\n\r\nSee\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/additional-license-rights.html\r\n\r\nAt
    this point, the licenses may be the same. But if they're not, be assured the Monotype
    conglomeration will get you for every nickel thy can. Except it won't be nickels...
    And they also now own several distribution channels, including MyFonts. Adobe
    is rather more generous."

  body: In my opinion Avenir Next is much better than Avenir. It has optically corrected
    italics, not just the slanted ones (a disease many sans serifs from the early
    years of PostScript fonts suffer from). Also the quality of the curves of Avenir
    Next comes much closer to the original digital Linotype version from the pre-PostScript
    era.

    Adobe apps.

  body: "Sye: twice, no.\r\n\r\nFirst, it doesn't matter whether you are on Windows
    or on Mac -- the set of free (and, might I add, <em>very good</em>) fonts is the
    same.\r\n\r\nBut, second, only Minion Pro is in that list. Zapf Dingbats comes,
    IIRC, with Acrobat Pro (but if you have a recent Arial Unicode MS, you don't need
    it), and Avenir and Antique Olive need to be purchased separately."

  body: "You can get the entire Avenir (plus Next) on a PC? how? It comes with OSX
    on a mac.\r\n\r\nI am wrong about Antique Olive, I thought it came with either
    Adobe or Apple, but seems it does not."

    he was right to use the word \u201Cbundled\u201D which is not the same as \u201Cfree.\u201D
    None of those are \u201Cfree fonts\u201D!"

  body: "Thanks Thomas!\r\n\r\nIn regard to the original question, and the response
    from Charles Ellertson, if you buy from MyFonts, my understanding is that you
    are bound by each foundries own EULA, not an overriding MyFonts EULA, so you could
    buy the Adobe versions of the fonts if you felt the EULA was better. \r\n\r\nYou
    could also equally buy them from FontShop or Fonts.com direct (not sure if Minion
    Pro is sold there).\r\n\r\nOne question about Minion Pro, if you have InDesign,
    it is one of the bundled fonts, so you should already have it. Or do you need
    the license for a client's use?\r\n\r\nWhat version of InDesign are you using? "
