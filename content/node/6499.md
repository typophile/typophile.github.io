  body: The catalogue is in English and published by the Argo publishing house in
    Prague. The ISBN is 80-7203-515-0, I guess it should be available internationally.
    <BR> <BR>I visited the exhibition in the <a href="http://www.nmn.de/">Neues Museum
    N&uuml;rnberg</a>. The exhibition there is very nicely done and I enjoyed it very
    much. I

  body: What was very nice to see was at the time of the exhibition in Prague, the
    posters of the exhibition were &#42;everywhere&#42; &#40;bus shelters, billboards
    etc&#41;. You wouldn&#39;t see that in many cities around the world...

  body: In fact, it was the very first Sutnar&#39;s retrospective exhibition in Czech
    Republic. And yes, it was quite successful with a great media support - every
    newspapers and weekly magazine reviewed it. The curator, Iva Knobloch, had been
    preparing it for five years. I hope that ATypI Prague Conference attendees won&#39;t
    miss an opportunity to watch her talk on Sutnar! She is really an expert in Sutnar&#39;s
    life and work. <BR> <BR>Pavel
