body: "Hello\r\nThis was a sticker on a truck that needed to be vectorized. Its a
  serif font, in which the letters have been manually moved around. I would just trace
  it, but the angle is wrong... \r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, and it
  doesn't have to be exact, just close!\r\n\r\nThanks"
