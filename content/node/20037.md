  funky and handdrawn, but not novelty or wedding-invitation-y. Seems like the vast
  majority of script faces out there are just silly.\r\n\r\nStorm's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/rondka/\">Rondka</a>
  is really close, but too slanted for my purposes. I like that it's deliberate, not
  like dashed-off handwriting, and not too ornamental.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    target="_blank">mahogany script</a>, but its not really what you're looking for
    i think?

  body: "Thanks all for the suggestions. Sadly none of them are quite right. Stanyan
    Autumn is way too casual, Coquette too stylized (though I've always loved it),
    Mahagony Script too journal-y. Stefan, Montessori is really nice and not at all
    silly, but also not quite what I need.\r\n\r\nI'm really looking for something
    that looks like it was labored over, but labored over by an amateur. Something
    like a Brothers Quay title card. Something like the attached image, which is a
    portion of a piece in the book...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/doodle_4805.jpg]"
