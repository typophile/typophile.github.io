body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nClient likes http://www.linotype.com/799/ITCSlimbach-family.html
  for body text. I, too, am finding it quite lovely.\r\n\r\nThe client has seen it
  paired with Univers for titles, headings, and captions, and they like it; client
  already uses Franklin Gothic for a lot of their visual identity, which I think pairs
  with Slimbach about as well as Univers. Which is to say, OK but not great.\r\n\r\nSo,
  what sans would YOU pair with body-text Slimbach for titles, headings, and captions?
  And, what would you use for pull-quotes?\r\n\r\nIt would be for publications for
  a department at a major university. So, inviting and serious, but if we can avoid
  being stodgy that would please the client (and me).\r\n\r\nWhat think you?"

  body: I second Antenna. Also, since Slimbach has a large x-height, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/vectora/?refby=i">Vectora</a>
    could fit well, too.
