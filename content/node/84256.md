  website that I'm currently designing. I'd love to know people's thoughts on the
  typography - this isn't my strongest area and is something I'm really keen to improve
  on. I've included a few notes on my thought process when laying this out. Please
  tell me if you think I might be doing something wrong! Also let me know if any of
  this doesn\u2019t make sense.\r\n\r\nA few notes - This is for a website and uses
  fonts on the google web fonts service displaying on a vista machine - therefore
  some things might not look as crisp as they would in a perfect world.\r\n\r\n(You
  may need to scroll to the right to see these full and I've also uploaded them as
  files and there are a few more notes below them)\r\n\r\nNORMAL VIEW:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norm_4746.jpg]\r\n\r\nWITH
  GRID\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/withgrid_3494.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted
  the heading to have twice as much space where possible above as they do below so
  that are in close proximity to their paragraphs.\r\n\r\nI've set the base font to
  a simple arial at 13/18. I've tried to stick to the classical typographical scale
  but 12 was too small and 14 too large in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThe \"leading text\"
  (first bit in italic) is open sans condensed italic at 24/36. I've added a 4px margin
  at the top which puts it on the baseline. I've made this up to 18px by adding a
  14px margin at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe headings are all open sans condensed.\r\n\r\nSecondary
  headline is 36/36 with 9px margin top and 9px margin below\r\n\r\nThird headline
  is 24/36. 36 seems a bit too much but the likely hood of these going over 2 lines
  is very low. I also thought about shifting this a few pixels so that it falls on
  the either the baseline or the \"half baseline\" but decided against it.\r\n\r\nThe
  quote on the right does a similar thing to \"leading text\" in that it shifts as
  its so close the baseline."

    paragraphs than between heading and paragraph.

  body: "Thanks for the reply riccard0. I really wanted the headings to be in close
    proximity to the text that was associated to it so that a quick scan made it obvious.
    Perhaps its obvious anyway? \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? \r\n\r\nDoes anyone
    else feel the same? would be great to get other opinions on this.\r\n\r\nappreciated\r\nMatt\r\n"
