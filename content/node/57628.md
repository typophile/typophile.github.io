  for the life of me remember.\r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Eastwood_Collegiate_Institute.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated. And try not to tease me TOO much. I know that
  I should know it."

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/martin-gothic/|Martin Gothic]] seems like
    a better match, because the W is crossed, but the S is fully curved. I wonder
    if they changed the S shape for manufacturing simplicity, or if it only looks
    straight in the photo?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nI agree, Martin Gothic is a good suggestion, the only difference
    is that the crossbar in their \"A\" runs lower. I checked their web site and their
    logo is inconsistent across the board....\r\n\r\n- sal"

  body: Yes, sadly the school doesn't exactly have the GREATEST sense of design. I'll
    keep looking, maybe I have a better image somewhere.
