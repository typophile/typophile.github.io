  alt=""> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not going to bother stepping up to any soap boxes over
  this one. But it&#39;s just more evidence that co-branding, while it may make absolute
  pefect business sense, rarely looks good. It rarely bolsters either brand&#39;s
  image. &#40;Speaking from purely a visual-branding perspective.&#41;

  body: Seems to me they could have silhouetted the little guy and it still would
    have read correctly, with the added bonus of following the style already set in
    place. Whoever drew it though, blew it. Those outlines are all wrong. I&#39;m
    happy someone else agrees with me. The ad has been an eyesore on their homepage
    for too long &#40;or so it seems&#41;.  <BR> <BR>
