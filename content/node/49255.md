body: "This is my first post on Typophile, so i'm not sure whether this is best placed
  in a Blog or a Forum Topic for help, but here goes: I have been asked to create
  a folded leaflet for NHS Employability. It will be a 6 page DL (flat size A4 - folded
  twice to DL).\r\n\r\nI have created 3 colums with 4mm gutters. Type will be Frutiger
  - 14pt for headings and 11pt for body copy - there is a 2pt leading for the body
  copy and all text is aligned to the baseline grid.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if these
  measurements would be suitable for a leaflet like this - as it is the first time
  I have used InDesign and the first time I have created something for print. If anyone
  could offer any advice with the measurements or suggest alternative fonts to have
  the best impact in this medium, I would be extremely grateful.\r\n\r\nMany thanks."
