body: "Hello typophiles,\r\n\r\nI've been pondering on this job for some time now,
  and thought I'd get some feedback and inspiration.\r\n\r\nI volunteer work for the
  communication group of a newly started political organisation in Denmark, called
  \"Yngresagen\" (literally: \"The younger cause\", playing on the existence of a
  large danish organisation: '\xC6ldresagen', which means \"The older cause\"). Yngresagen
  wants to help the young generation(s) get an opinion in the parliament (that's the
  lobby-part), but also to make it easy for members and volunteers to start up projects
  of their own (that's the activity-part, which is the most important one). Our target
  group as far as members goes, are young people between 13 and 35 years old (yes,
  that's an awful large and diverse group). But we also need to communicate with all
  sorts of media and of course the politicians. Furthermore, it's going to be a nation
  wide organisation, possibly the largest for our target group.\r\n\r\n------\r\nI
  hope to express some of the following words: young (duh), competent (instead of
  the empty 'serious'), a pinch of politics, progressiveness & forward-thinking, creativity
  (more than a lobby org.), dynamic, fun & play,\r\n\r\nI really want to make the
  logo dynamic and non-static. In fact even plastic or elastic, in the sense that
  users/members/supporters could \"remix\" and even adopt the logo for their own purposes,
  thereby making it their own. My working idea is a green (yngresagens color) spiral,
  that, when it is drawn, resembles somewhat a fingerprint - with a wee imagination
  at least. Their initial logo was a real fingerprint. If drawn differently, it could
  also look like a tube \u2013 or even a megaphone (symbolising how the organisation
  could get the youth heard in public matters). If we want to be really fancy, it
  could also look like an ear. Nature is full of spirals and that can be exploited.
  I've included some examples of what I mean. I hope my idea doesn't sound too diffuse.\r\n\r\nFor
  the logo type, I thought having it:\r\n* Sans and lower-case (maybe the 'Y' as a
  small capital, thereby only reaching the x-height)\r\n* A grotesque of some sort,
  but with a humanistic tendency: cut-off sharp corners to make it less solid, but
  keep a vacuum-feeling\r\n* Perhaps: transparency? (symbolising just that: that we
  want as little as possible to be hidden from the public). Example: http://www.cphdox.dk/d1/front.lasso
  (by the way, does anyone know this type? Maybe it's a custom design)\r\n\r\nBy the
  way, I have (almost) completely free hands on this project, so deroutes from my
  original idea are greatly appreaciated as well! I just want to discuss this as much
  as possible and look forward to hear your suggestions and ideas\r\n\r\nMalte"

    me what I could do to better may chances for a dialogue on this, I'd greatly appreciate
    it. I'm still rather green in the design community, so I have a tendency too describe
    and talk about things in a more intuitive way. But I try to learn a lot from reading
    this board, so please suggest me what to do.\r\n\r\nI could write a short version
    of the above, maybe? I guess I just like lots of words, and therefore slack on
    being precise. Oops."

  body: "The spiral is one of the greatest symbols. I think you've activated enough
    ideas that you may need to take the next steps and offer something more finished
    for comment. \r\n\r\nThe font you show does look custom because of the transparent
    overlaps. [[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-38-politic-abcd|Politic
    ABCD]] has a similar feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Why don't you tighten up your spiral mark and let the line quality guide
    your sense of the type.\r\n\r\nPolitic ABCD used to be Politica. From the description
    it is used by the Green Party. The C and D versions, in particular, do look like
    police. Because this type is devised of large blocks you might attempt to render
    the spiral in a block style\u2014as if the pixels were very large\u2014and match
    the weight to the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "edit: oops. I meant to say: \"there are <em>no</em> lower-cases in the type.\r\n\r\nI've
    been thinking in lower-cases so far, and only the relation between 'y' and 'n'
    is what keeps me from being absolutely settled about it.\r\n\r\nI'm going to work
    on the spiral with my type-ideas in mind\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yikes. It seems like my pre-previous post was deleted. I might not understand
    the editing system of this board. Hm.\r\n\r\nI like elements in your idea, thanks
    for the input! I was beginning to turn my head towards very thin sans types, because
    of the 'y' (actually Gotham thin - but it's probably too american). But I like
    the layer effect, so maybe I'll try heavier weights in that kind of setting.\r\n\r\n\u2013
