  After researching Vox's classification system, researching modern type (that added
  several new factors to typeface classification), I'm still not sure if there is
  a 100% correct way to classify typefaces.  I've seen the following categories in
  different resources (printed, not online resources):\r\n\r\nv1\r\n- Old Style\r\n-
  Italic\r\n- Transitional\r\n- Modern\r\n- Egyptian/Slab Serif\r\n- Sans Serif\r\n\r\nv2\r\n-
  Archaic\r\n- Old Style (aka Classical)\r\n- Transitional\r\n- Modern\r\n- Sans Serif\r\n-
  Slab Serif\r\n- Graphic/Display\r\n\r\nAny of these correct categorizations in terms
  of historical as well as modern day context? Can anyone shed some more light on
  the situation?"

    one category. I honestly don\u2019t use classification a lot, but the categories
    that make sense to me are:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Serif</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Old style</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Venetian</li>\r\n<li>Aldine/Garalde</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Transitional</li>\r\n<li>Modern</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Sans

    serif</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Humanist</li>\r\n<li>Grotesque \u2014 <em>Hmm? Not sure

    \u2014 <em>I have to dig deeper into this</em></li>\r\n<li>Blackletter \u2014
    <em>I have to dig deeper into this as well</em></li>\r\n<li>++</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nMonospaced
    fonts and pixel fonts are often grouped on the side but I happen to think that\u2019s
    a bad idea. The usually fit into one of these categories.\r\n\r\nApart from that,
    I also operate vaugely with, and might not fully grasp yet, terms like Egyptienne,
    Italienne, Scotch, Semi serif, Cursive (often connected to the roman, but still
    something completely different) and a few others I can\u2019t think of at the
    moment. Edit: I can think of Fleischmann, but that\u2019s only because I always
    think of it as so unique it doesn\u2019t really fit in any other category (in
    my mind)."

    same or similar model: the (former) writing tool which determines the type of
    contrast and principle of form. Roughly that is broad nib/old style/humanist/chancery,
    pointed nib/modern/grotesque/roundhand, round nib/geometric/free"

    Yes, clarendons - they're under the slab umbrella. You can always dig deeper.
