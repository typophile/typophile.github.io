  than a decade and i\u2019ve finally decided to seek some wisdom from the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt
  is generally recommended that you place points at the extreme tops, bottoms, lefts
  and rights of your glyphs. My question is: exactly how important is this? I mean,
  what happens if you ignore this rule.\r\n\r\nI do a lot of rounded type and especially
  rounded glyphs can get you in a bit of a headache here, because the extreme points
  of rounded glyphs are not necessaryly important points for the definition of the
  shape - in contrast to non-rounded glyphs where extreme points are almost always
  also defining points for the glyph shape.\r\n\r\nSo far i\u2019ve always followed
  the extreme point rule eventough it meant polluting my outlines a bit, but in the
  fonts i\u2019m working on right now i\u2019d like to keep my outlines clean. And
  so far i havn\u2019t had any problems with printing or displaying these fonts...\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone shed some light?\r\nThanks, Alex.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kk_4808.png]"

    I thought this article might really be of help regarding the story behind FF DIN
    Round. The PDF linked at the bottom of the article regarding it's construction
    is very informative.\r\n\r\nI believe one of the main reasons behind constructing
    the rounds with extremes as you mention, has to do with hinting, which is covered
    on page 20 of the DIN Round PDF.\r\n\r\nhttp://fontfeed.com/archives/the-new-ff-din-round-much-more-than-a-rounded-din\r\n\r\nMike"

    of your idea. Nothing should overrule that. \r\n\r\n\"Hinting\", though not nothing,
    is only truly effective in TT, where a format conversion is going to leave points
    close enough to extrema, and your example, as shown on the left is entirely hint-able.
    T1 hinting depends on Zones which your example can fall nicely into as well, as
    shown on the left.\r\n\r\nIf you want to prove to Yourself! that the left version
    is best for font scaling, regardless of hinting, follow these simple steps, and
    look at the illustration below. \r\n\r\nIn a copy of your font with both digitizing
    options represented, change the Em to around 50/1000th of it's existing units
    per, and scale all the glyphs too. \r\n\r\nThen, scale the Em back to it's original
    size, 1000/1000ths, all the glyphs too, and observe: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClubOne_5561.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    top left contour is the clean and accurate capture of the idea at 1000, unscaled.
    The top right is the capture of the idea at 1000 according to the prevailing suggestion,
    also unscaled.\r\n\r\nThe bottom is both options scaled to 50 units per em and
    back.\r\n\r\nAs big as the deformation to both shapes appears, the deformation
    of the bottom right seems a bit more serious, and directly related to the presence
    of the extrema."

    you for your clear example.\r\n\r\nI have been discussing this topic over and
    over, and I agree with Alex that his original drawing (left) is just more natural,
    specially when it comes to rounded fonts.\r\n\r\nI mean, we all agree that drawing
    glyphs with proper extreme points facilitates things enormously, and is a useful
    thing to do.\r\nHowever, when placing extremes presents more difficulties than
    advantages, I\u2019d really rather focus on the shape instead of trying to fit
    extreme points, distorting my outlines.  \r\n\r\nIt feels to me that \u2018points
    at extremes\u2019 has taken the place of a dogma for many, and although 20 years
    ago printers might have crashed trying to process badly-drawn fonts, it is time
    to re-think this assumption in many cases. \r\n\r\nBTW: even the original <a href='http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF

  body: "So do you guys think the FF Din Round example is a bit extreme? Considering
    we're moving towards higher and higher resolution devices it looks like hinting
    will eventually become unnecessary and with that said extremes on rounded forms
    will be unnecessary as well.\r\n\r\nI've been facing this dilemma as I have an
    upcoming face that will have a rounded version and I've found that depending on
    the weight and size of the contour it can be really difficult to attach an extreme
    point without compromising the form even if the compromise is very subtle. At
    the same time, I PS Hint all our faces and know that I'll be at a loss with attaching
    a hint to a rounded end that doesn't have an extreme point.\r\n\r\nI also have
    some older faces that I intend to rework, adding extremes and properly hinting
    them although, again with say a Thin weight, even at 2000 UPM things get really
    tight when trying to attach points on such small rounded contours.\r\n\r\nAny
    advice on this?"

    that bit about PS-to-TT outline conversion leaving [off-curve] \u2018points close
    enough to extrema\u2019 needs to be highlighted and properly understood, because
    if the points are not close enough to extrema then you end up with a segment of
    curve that is beyond control of the hints and may round in unfortunate ways.\r\n\r\nNot
    having nodes at external extrema also means that the glyph bounding box will be
    inaccurately recorded. Tom Rickner told me off for doing that some years ago,
    and I've been faithfully noding my extrema ever since."

    low rez conditions (including serif details) just clutter the hinting scheme so
    they are best left without points at extremma. Curves that are of a relative size
    to be described adequately under low rez conditions still need points at extrema,
    however.

  body: "Alex, \r\n\r\nif you define an alignment zone or ghost hint for the purposes
    of equalizing the baseline and the x-height in very small screen sizes (through
    hinting), and in some glyphs there will be no point there, or the point will not
    be at the extremum, then the hinting may work not as you'd expect. In your design,
    hinting will work better if you draw your glyph as you've shown it on the right
    (with points at extremes). \r\n\r\nPoints at extremes are primarily relevant for
    hinting purpose. Other than that, you don't need to worry about them. Especially
    in italic typefaces, points at extremes in the x-direction (i.e. on the left and
    on the right) are not really important if you don't use x-direction hinting. "

  body: 'Points at extremes are important for both .otf and .ttf because of the hinting.
    Basically, if you want to have your baseline and x-height align at small sizes,
    i.e. you want the overshoots for your round and spiky letters not to look awkward,
    then you need some points there (and hints) so the rasterizer knows WHICH points
    to align. Because of subpixel rendering, points at extremes are still important
    in the y-direction (i.e. on top and bottom of forms) while in the x-direction
    they are not. For example, for italic letterforms, I would say that they are no
    longer really mandatory on the left and right edges. But it''s still "safer" to
    put them there until we can reliably find out that not having them doesn''t cause
    some awkward issues in applications that rely on bounding boxes when doing line
    layout (for example, I suppose Adobe InDesign''s "optical margin alignment" does
    take bounding boxes into account). '
