body: "I'm looking to get back into type design after being away from it for quite
  a while.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit long in the tooth, (<em>I'm one of the people who can
  actually remember the last glorious days of hot metal</em>) and when I last had
  anything to do with font creation on a Macintosh, Fontographer was the industry
  standard program.\r\n\r\nI've just checked the comparison charts between this and
  FontLab Studio on their website, (<em>which didn't really give me the information
  that I wanted</em>) and I'm now not sure whether I need to spend the extra money.\r\n\r\nEssentially,
  I'd like to be able to create OpenType typefaces, (<em>possibly sometimes using
  an OpenType face as a starting point for the creation of the font</em>). The programs
  look broadly similar to each other in terms of what they can and will do, and I'm
  not really sure what the pros and cons are of the two programs when compared to
  each other.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help please? Thanks!\r\n"

    do. It has a steep learning curve, and it is more expensive than Fontographer.
    Leslie Cabarga's book, \"Learn FontLab Fast!\" is highly recommended.\r\n\r\nI
    prefer Fontographer. The interface is much, much easier, and it's generally a
    joy to use. All of the shortcomings of the current version will be addressed in
    a later update, as promised by the developer.\r\n\r\nI'd get both, as I prefer
    doing most of the work in Fontographer, and fine-tuning and finishing up in FontLab.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can only get one, and a full battery of OT tools is a deal breaker, FontLab
    is probably the better choice."

    product line with Type Tool 3? If you decide that it's right for you, you get
    all but $9.00 of the purchase price back by upgrading to FontLab...

  body: "Unless you're aiming to become a font engineer, I think you'll find that
    Fontographer 5 is just what a long-in-the-tooth type designer needs. Fontographer's
    huge advantage for me is its superbly  intuitive drawing tools.\r\n\r\nFog enables
    and encourages me to think about designing rather than fighting with the TypeTool
    user interface that is not as elegant or FontLab's which is complicated by more
    bells & whistles than I'll ever need.\r\n\r\nFontographer 5 now opens and generates
    Fontlab quality OpenTypes, glyphs look beautifully antialiased, keyboard commands
    are still where they used to be in Altsys Fontographer - better because command+7
    gives you a really useful 1600% view of a glyph. If you're already familiar with
    ye olde Fontographer, version 5 is just as delightful to use and has added Fontlab
    funtionality too."

  body: "Yes, it can.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FOG-OT_4079.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,
    please note that Fontographer can create OpenType fonts, but you cannot create
    OpenType features inside Fontographer (i. e., automatic glyph substitutions such
    as ligatures, small caps, contextual alternates and so on). According to Adam,
    \ http://typophile.com/node/65415, 17.Jun.2010 8.13am: \u201CThe main organization
    for the windows is largely the same as in FOG 4, i.e. a Font Window, a Glyph Window,
    a Metrics Window. No classes editor, no OpenType features editor, no Preview panel
    etc. You can specify OpenType Layout features in an external text editor using
    the AFDKO 2.5 syntax. We plan auto-generation of OpenType Layout features for
    common European scripts in a later version, but there won't be a \"visual\" feature
    editor -- this is something for FontLab Studio. I mean, you can use Microsoft
    VOLT or the demo version of FontLab Studio, or one of the DTL applications or
    FontForge etc. to develop the features if you want. Or a text editor. Or something
    else\u201D."

    be kind.)\r\n\r\nCan an OpenType font be imported into Fontographer 5.0 to have
    some modifications and additional glyphs added and then generate a new OpenType
    font without losing any of its original open type functionality?"

  body: "Emkeyser, \r\n\r\nunfortunately, FOG is still missing an important bit, which
    is decompilation of feature definitions into the Adobe FDK format. FontLab Studio
    can do this (you can download the demo version, open an OpenType font, save the
    decompiled features into a text file, and proceed in Fontographer). The DTL OTMaster
    which is also available from our website can also do it, and does a somewhat better
    job since it supports the AFDKO 2.5 syntax. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
