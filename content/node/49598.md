  body: Really cool! I do have a postcard which I was thinking to hand set the back
    side. Now looking at Museo 500 I think I am going to use it instead. Re-que-congrats!

  body: "\"Only for a day ;-)\"  LOL! (literally)\r\n\r\nThat was great Jos... I absoulutely
    love Museo, when you released the sample, I adopted it as my corporate font, not
    knowing that it was going to be more popular than helvetica, even if if is just
    for a day, dude... that is frickin' awesome. Well done, thanks and keep up all
    your hard work... Can't wait to see what's next!\r\n\r\n\u2014Justin"

  body: And now Museo has been used in <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2009/01/14/inconspicuous-vertical-metrics/#more-4002">an
    article about type design</a>. Does that make it a new classic?
