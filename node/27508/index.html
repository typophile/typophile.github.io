		<div class="commentbody">I must agree with Sii, 

The Univers Chart is so cool, and has been used by many other typefaces to show off the weights. 

The Table is a piece of artwork in itself. I am not really a fan of the word 'cool' but i guess if a typeface can have such an effect on people without even trying, then its pretty cool

maybe, erik meant with "more cool" -> more neutral. less character in its shape, more neutrality.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Henry

To get to the heart of Spiekermann's statement, I suggest you try setting the same text, preferably one in a foreign language* (maybe a hundred words at about 9 point and with a reasonable line length and leading value) in both Univers and Helvetica; print them out and compare them side by side. As you look at them, try and gauge them in relative terms of function, temperature or visual edge - which of the two appears to be more rational or more humanistic? which appears warmer or cooler? or softer or harder?
* if you can't read it for sense, it will help you look at it objectively.

I gave up long ago on expressing a preference for either one of these particular faces, but there are many <em>typographers</em> I know and respect who feel passionately about these things. There are also many alternatives to both Univers and Helvetica, since we are now nearly fifty years beyond their original release dates. Having said that, Bram's oblique reference to <a/href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/390030.html">AG </a>should not go univestigated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yesterday I got the Linotype newsletter celebrating Adrian Frutiger’s 80th birthday. Amongst other things, there’s an <a href="http://www.linotype.com/en/2705-27594/may2008.html">article by Akira Kobayashi on Univers vs. Helvetica</a>. You’ll see how Univers’ spacing is much wider than Helvetica, which supposedly makes it more fit for text settings. More open counterforms and finer details give it that sharp look, which may be perceived by some people as overly “cold” – but not to me.

(As a side note: Linotype’s Web site is terrible, I tried finding that article and could not figure for the life of me where they put it. I ended up going back to the newsletter, in frustration).</div>

It’s not too long (about 40 minutes) and I quite enjoyed it. As far as I know this is as close as it gets to a biography, but keep also in mind that the man wrote a lot of books: I recommend you try to find a copy of <cite>Type Sign Symbol</cite> through some library, it’s impossible to find one to actually buy.

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>I just can’t see Univers being characterized as “cool”... more of a bread-and-butter, nuts-and-bolts kind of thing, right? As in not very glamorous or sexy. I’m mean, we’re talking about the typeface on the “Yes, we’re open!” signs here.</cite>

Oops! I was thinking of Frutiger when I posted the pic of the Concorde, but I think the idea (and shape) stands. Frutiger is French-ish, to use an absolutely awful expression that I may have just made up. Univers is not some old German clunker, it's sleek, new, sexy, and yes, cool...in a late 60's French-sort-of-way. It's power was in what it replaced, which is hard to know about today.

I could also make the jab that Univers is to Segoe as Concorde is to Boeing 787. Some Boeing fans might interpret that comparison favorably, although I mean it ambiguously. Newer is sometimes better, but not always. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Honestly, the Frutiger DVD is terrible. Very boring and uninteresting. When you have seen a documentary like Helvetica, then what is possible to do with such an artist, it's a pity. As of the biography, It actually exist in french language, the title is "Adrian Frutiger; une vie dediee a l'ecriture typographique", and it is a great, 128 pages book. I suggest some of you convince an american publisher to get the translation rights from Atelier Perrousseaux.

		<div class="commentbody">I've heard over ad over from designers in my area that their default body copy choice is Univers.  Their reason for choosing such is that they consider Helvetica totally clean and neutral, but Univers is *almost* helvetica, but not quite.

I think it's that tiny bit of cayenne pepper in the pot of spaghetti sauce that gives it a slight kick - it's not much but it doesn't have that skeleton feel helvetica can often have.

Maybe that's what he meant…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Like Helvetica there seem to be so many rip offs of Univers - that we haven't seen a good version in years. I hated it when Adobe released their version - and used a "common" ampersand, instead of the distinguished ampersand Univers was known for.</div>
