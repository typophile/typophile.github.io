  know if I may be off the mark or maybe I have to look again but I\u2019m in the
  middle of font production with Illustrator and switched to Fontlab Studio 5.04 after
  using Illustrator to draw and Fontographer to do everything else...not to go into
  too much detail but where is the mythical \u201CDo Not Rescale EPS\u201D feature
  that is supposed to be under the Preferences section on the Macintosh version of
  Fontlab 5.04...or does it go by another name now?\r\n\r\nSecond question...does
  anyone know about any good (existing) type foundries in Atlanta?\r\n\r\nCan\u2019t
  wait to hear the answers,\r\nSas"

    grid in Illustrator properly. Great detailed instructions can be found here \u2013

    is what I used when I first started with FontLab. But after a short time, I realized
    how much of a waste of time it was to draw in Illustrator first. It is better
    to learn how to draw in FontLab.\r\n\r\nAs to your second question, there is no
    type foundry in Atlanta, good or otherwise. The closest are probably Phil's Fonts/Garage
    Fonts in Washington, DC, House Industries in Delaware, H&FJ in NYC, and Monotype
    and Font Bureau in Massachusetts. \r\n\r\nSorry :("
