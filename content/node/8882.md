body: 'Hebrew currently has a system of 8 punctuation marks. mainly, they arent used.
  even books hardly use punctuation. it&#39;s specifily used for making the meaning
  of a word clear, in case its spelling allows multiple meanings &#40;for example,
  God and To looks the same without punctuation&#41;.  <BR>and I have been thinking
  to myself - maybe there is a place for a simplified punctuation system. i have made
  sketchs for a system that uses only 3 marks, which are a line [A sound], a dot [I
  sound], and two dots [E sounds]. &#40;the O sound is has a letter in hebrew.&#41;
  <BR>so basicly, i choose 3 punctuation marks that are enough to be used today. all
  the other punctuation marks are variants of those simple sounds. they are learnt
  in high-school, but after that nobody really pays attention to them.  <BR> <BR>i
  can see the pro and cons in such a punctuation system: <BR>pros- <BR>&#42; not many
  people use the current punctuation system, the new one is much more usable and simple.
  it could be used more then the old system. <BR>&#42; it suits the way we speak hebrew
  nowadays. <BR>&#42; this has been done before. the current hebrew punctuation system
  is a simplified system of an even more big system. in the original system, the text
  looked like a mess, each word was surronded by many marks. <BR> <BR>cons- <BR>&#42;
  because 3 punctuation marks will be simplified into one, when someone will punctuate
  a word with this system, it will look like a punctuation mistake.  <BR>&#42; people
  probably wont like the idea because its a change too big to make. <BR> <BR>well.
  please tell me what you think. im very unsure about it.'

  body: 'This is very interesting. But any formal reform like this is a monumental
    task, nearly impossible to carry out in a democracy, due the fossilizing effect
    of that social system. The Koreans would never have gained their resplendent Hangul
    -which puts all other scripts of the world to shame- without their dedicated Monarch.
    <BR> <BR>But playing along... <BR>What I would ask is: what benefits does using
    <i>any</i> punctuation have in Hebrew? Does the potential disambiguation bring
    any de facto benefit to adult readers? &#40;Learning readers already have the
    full system.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: i heard you talk about Hangul in some other part of the forum. it sounded
    incredible indeed. yet this change im proposing is not in that scale. it far less
    revolutionary then the new alphabet of Wim Crouwel, or the CH glyph in some bauhaus
    fonts. <BR>thats why i feel it has more potential to survive then those attempts.
    <BR> <BR>well, currently some of the letters are partially used as vowels. the
    letter Vav for example, sometimes stands for the same sound as V, and sometimes
    it stands for O. there&#39;s nothing that points out its use other then the context
    it is used in. the word im currently looking at could be read &#39;reforma&#39;
    or &#39;refverma&#39;. i could even go farther when reading this word because
    there isnt any punctuation to the letters. its like reading the word &#39;rforma&#39;.
    the only way to know exactly how to read it is to know the word allready.  <BR>this
    happens in english too, when sometimes words look diffrent then they sound. but
    here it happens all the time, since we sliced the whole punctuation off the language.  <BR>im
    just not sure thats a good place for a language to be in. <BR> <BR>&#62; what
    benefits does using any punctuation have in Hebrew?  <BR>i think it could increase
    readability.  <BR>

  body: 'Punctuation is entirely the wrong term for the <i>nikud</i> points. These
    are vocalisation marks, i.e. vowels. <BR> <BR>You say that the &#39;current Hebrew
    punctuation system is a simplified system of an even more big system&#39; and
    note that in the original system &#39;the text looked like a mess, each word was
    surrounded by many marks&#39;. Surely you know that not all of those marks are
    vocalisation marks, the <i>teamin</i> are cantillation marks used pretty much
    exclusively for religious texts to assist the cantor during recitation. So the
    &#39;simplified system&#39; to which you refer is not really simplified at all:
    it is the use of vocalisation without cantillation, as has been done for non-religious
    texts for many centuries. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not saying your idea is without merit,
    only that you need to be much more sure of your facts before developing the proposal
    any further. Sadly, many proposals for reforming writing systems come from people
    who do not adequately understand the existing system.'

  body: '&#62; it far less revolutionary <BR> <BR>Let me ask: would a reader automatically
    understand your system, with no &#34;learning&#34;? In a society where a top-down
    implementation would be nearly impossible, the key is not requiring any active
    conscious effort. This limits ambitiousness, but at least it&#39;s realistic.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; this happens in english too <BR> <BR>With the huge difference that
    English is an Indo-eurpean language, where vowels play a pivotal role, while Hebrew
    is a Semitic one, where vowels only serve to differentiate between things like
    &#34;dig&#34; and &#34;digger&#34;, which are very rarely confusable in context.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; it could increase readability. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s possible &#40;although
    not to the extent of an Indo-european language&#41;. I guess the core question
    is, how often does the absense of points cause a reading stutter in an adult?
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Punctuation is entirely the wrong term <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right,
    it&#39;s confusing. Although maybe <i>technically</i> it&#39;s OK, since &#34;punct&#34;
    just means &#34;point&#34;! <BR> <BR>&#62; many proposals for reforming writing
    systems come from people who do not adequately understand the existing system.
    <BR> <BR>Very true, and this includes the great majority of people who never acquire
    even a cursory understanding of how humans actually read, as well as people who
    have misguided or circumstancial motivation - for example Bradbury Thompson was
    motived to create his unicase alphabet basically because his son had trouble reading.
    <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I would say that too much reverence for a writing
    system &#40;including its history&#41; can be a psychological barrier towards
    improvement. I&#39;m sure the Romans would have hated lowercase &#40;even Cassandre
    did&#41;, even though it&#39;s so much more readable than UC. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    cause a reading stutter in an adult?  <BR> <BR>well, i know sometimes it hard
    for me to read text aloud in class. sometimes i confuse one word with another.
    more often i stop for a split second to think &#39;how should i read this word&#39;.
    i know the word but its still alittle stuck on my tongue. this wouldnt have happened
    with some vocalisation marks. dont you think? <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: I encourage you to continue to think about it, but I worry that proposing
    a solution &#40;replace existing vocalisation with three marks&#41; is jumping
    the gun. You should never begin with a solution, but always with a thorough analysis
    of the problem, beginning with the question &#39;Is there, in fact, a problem?&#39;
    There are lots of solutions floating around out there looking for a problem. You
    should try to avoid any prejudgements or hasty conclusions that will impose a
    teleological programme on your investigation.

    of Reading&#34; &#40;which contains a great explanation of Hangul, btw&#41;, and
    there&#39;s some stuff on Hebrew. Specifically, there&#39;s a reference to a study

    adults ... the presence or absence of the vowel signs does not seem to affect
    the latency for pronunciation&#34;. On the other hand, there&#39;s certainly a
    difference between deliberative reading &#40;the case when pronouncing things
    outloud&#41; versus immersive reading &#40;where vocalization -even silent vocalization-
    is tangential, and speeds are much higher, fixations much shorter&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp
