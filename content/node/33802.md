  The Art of Matthew Carter\u2019) and fell in love with Galliard (again). However,
  there seem to been a whola lotta versions out there. \r\n\r\nThe roman cut seems
  to no problem, the CC version is available at fontshop. Too bad it isn't opentype
  yet (somebody has an idea if its coming btw?).\r\nAfter some reading it seems the
  Bitstream version (for the bolds) fits the CC roman best.It was digitised under
  MC\u2019s supervision.  The ITC version (+ adobe, E+F, Linotype) has shortenend
  ascenders & descenders (Carter's drawings we\u2019re \u2018adapted\u2019 for jobbing
  purposes). \r\n\r\nSo I surfed to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-galliard/\">Myfonts</a>
  \u2014 but to my dismay, myfonts can't sell the Bitstream version anymore due to
  licensing issues :-(\r\n\r\nAnybody has a clue when this issues will be resolved?
  Or when Bitstream Galliard will be available again? Or is there another foundry
  with a version that goes with the CC version? "
