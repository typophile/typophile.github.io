body: "As a small foundry we have developed numerous typefaces and are in the process
  of converting all our fonts to open type. The problem we are having is that our
  kerning pairs (although displaying fine in the metrics/kern window) are not making
  it into our otf file, or it appears that way when loaded into indesign and illustrator.
  What we are looking for is an online tutorial or some expert advice into generating
  reliable, complete, and of course cross-platform font files.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  or suggestions would be most appreciated.\r\n(we are running Fontlab 4.5)\r\n\r\nNiels

  body: "Niels, this has been covered here somewhere before, but...\r\n\r\nYou need
    to add a second OT feature to your files. For some buggy reason, fonts which only
    have a kern feature do not access that feature. The most common solution is to
    add the \"basic\" ligature feature for fi and fl substitution.\r\n\r\nLet us know
    if this works for you."

  body: "It's important that the second feature is of substitution type. With just
    the \"kern\" feature, only the GPOS table is included in the font file, and no
    GSUB. However, falsely, InDesign CS2 only checks for the presence of the GSUB
    table, and if there is none, does not process any OpenType features. Something
    like: \r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  sub f i by fi; \r\n  sub f l by fl; \r\n} liga;
    \r\n\r\nwould help out as this will ensure that a GSUB substitution table is included
    in the font file. I have requested that in the next version of AFDKO, an empty
    GSUB table is always included even if there are not substitution features are
    defined by the user. \r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

  body: 'A small quibble: There are a number of fonts where either there are no f-ligatures,
    or shouldn''t be (cap/small-cap fonts come to mind). If you use f-ligaturing,
    then any letterspacing you use runs into a bump with the ligatures. The most innocuous
    candidate I''ve found is "zero" "slash" "zero" to percent.'

  body: "Charles, \r\n\r\nI don't think a replacement of \"0/0\" with \"%\" makes
    any sense at all. But if you think it's a good idea, what feature would you associate
    this with? \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Adam, you're right, I should have listed the feature -- it is the fraction
    feature, which FontLab (5.0) will generate automatically. If there are no fractions,
    you can use\r\n\r\n@SLASH = [slash fraction];\r\nfeature frac {\r\n sub zero'
    @SLASH' zero' zero' by perthousand;\r\n sub zero' @SLASH' zero' by percent;\r\n}
    frac;\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be a ligature feature -- Anything that generates
    a GSUB table will work, and fractions, which aren't on by default, are a safer
    substitution. If there is no \"perthousand\" in the font, just kill that one (actually,
    FontLab just won't generate the routine if it isn't in the font).\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "I believe it's also perfectly fine (spec-wise) to substitute a glyph for
    itself, so you could have something like:\r\n\r\n<code>feature lnum {\r\n\_\_\_sub
    zero by zero;\r\n\_\_\_sub one by one;\r\n\_\_\_# and so on...\r\n} lnum;</code>\r\n\r\nI'm
    sorta working off the top of my head here, so maybe there's a good reason to not
    do exactly that, with lnum; it's just an example of an approach worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n(In
    fact, I think the feature file \"ignore sub\" statement ends up in an OTF the
    same way, i.e. <code>ignore sub a b'</code> ends up being <code>sub a b' by b</code>,
    so perhaps a single <code>ignore sub</code> statement is also an option... not
    that I've actually tried this yet!)"
