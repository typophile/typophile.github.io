  body: "i like the font but i actually need it to match as close as possible >_<
    \r\n\r\nin yours the Y, C, and h are just to far off. the others i could probably
    use but i need the uppercase to match mainly. and im pretty sure its not hand
    lettered because it the duplicates match quite close if not exact. \r\n\r\non
    a side note, nick i noticed your font didn't have any tags adding tags to this
    might help it get out there more ;) "
