  body: "Here are two data points from original editions that I am fortunate to own
    (my late father was an architect and a big fan of Wright). I'm not suggesting
    that you slavishly follow the format of FLLW's own books, but at least this is
    instructive, since both books were produced with his blessings and participation:\r\n\r\n<em>When
    Democracy Builds,</em> Univ of Chicago, 1945\r\n<em>An American Architecture,</em>
    Horizon, 1955\r\n\r\nBoth books use Futura for display set in all caps, and Baskerville
    for text. Curiously, there are a few instances of what looks like Kabel that managed
    to sneak in (cap Y has fully slanted right stroke, and G looks like Kabel, although
    I suppose it may be some other design. In any case, a very minor thing.)\r\n\r\nOne
    interesting aspect of these designs is the use of Futura in two simultaneous modes:
    on a typical page, you'll see a running head in a dark stripe of smaller letterspaced
    Futura Bold, and in the midst of the light gray plane of text, an A or B head
    in larger Futura Medium set absolutely tight and solid. (My eye looks at these
    and immediately wishes they had letterspaced it a <em>little bit</em> at least,
    just to equalize interletter space, but it was clearly a very deliberate choice.)\r\n\r\nThe
    title pages use Futura. The 1945 book has letterspaced Futura Bold for the title,
    with smaller Baskerville all caps for author and publisher. The 1955 book has
    a very memorable design: the spread has a  large b&w portrait photo of Wright
    as frontis, seen from the side with his gaze directed toward the gutter, and opposite
    this is four lines of Futura Medium all caps, widely letterspaced, in horizontal
    stripes going from the gutter right out to the edges of the paper (rather than
    conforming to the limits of the type page).\r\n\r\nHope this is of some use. The
    fact that two books ten years apart share a number of the same characteristics
    makes me think this is aligned with his own tastes (or at least he agreed with
    what the publisher presented to him)."
