body: Should the business card and compliment slip reflect the design of the letterhead?
  i.e. should the layout and positioning of text, logo be similar so it looks more
  like a set rather than 3 different pieces? or is it best not to?

  body: Yes, it should look as if it is part of a set, i.e., all the pieces should
    reflect the save overarching corporate identity.

  body: "The short answer is keep it as a suite, bearing in mind that a letterhead
    obviously has a different purpose to a comp. slip and a business card. \r\n\r\nThe
    relationship of letterhead to comp. slip is much closer than the business card
    in that they will need the same information, postal address, registered address
    and registered number, probably with a generic telephone, fax, e-mail and url,
    wheras a business card has some of this information but with the name of the individual,
    with a direct line and e-mail and is not primarily intended to be written on.\r\n\r\nThe
    logo should be the same unless you have a clear reason why it shouldn't be, although
    you might consider if you have a particularly vertical logo you might require
    a horizontal logo for some applications, for example van graphics or website masthead.
    The treatment of the text needn't be exactly the same although I would keep to
    the typeface family, the proportions of point size and leading the same. It really
    depends on the design and requirements of the client, as a student (and I am guessing
    this a college project) you are probably best off starting with keeping the elements
    the same. \r\n\r\nTry searching for stationery projects in some design agency
    portfolios.\r\n\r\nTim"

      slip should be too? is there anything such as a vertical comp slip? '

  body: "There are vertical comp slips, the <em>usual</em> format is landscape.\r\nThe
    problem with portrait business cards is that one will occasionally come across
    somebody with a double barrelled name whether inherited or due to a marriage and
    that can present a problem with the name, but more of a problem is the e-mail
    address a long name joined to a long e-mail url can be too long for portrait to
    contain in one line.\r\nTim"
