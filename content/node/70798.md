  I'm wondering if any of you can recommend an alternative to Maison. Here's some
  info about what I'm looking for:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The font will be used as the logo
  and the soul font for my company, which is a graphic design studio.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  As an alternative I've looked at NBGrotesk from [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neubauladen/nbgrotesk_3585/|NEUBAU]]\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Another alternative is Akkurat from [[http://www.lineto.com|Lineto]], but I don't
  like the lowercase 'g'.\r\n\r\n\u2022 I'm looking for something quite strict and
  clean. The font will not be used in many different weights, I will mostly use other
  means to create a hierarchy in the typography (capital letters, size, kearning etc).\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Legibility is not the most important factor, but it needs to be legible enough for
  a couple of paragraphs.\r\n\r\n\u2022 As the font will be the main identity for
  our graphic profile, it needs to have a certain uniqueness (e.g. not Helvetica,
  more like Maison or NBGrotesk).\r\n\r\nThank's for your time, any help is greatly
  appreciated!"
