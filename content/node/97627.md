    in </blockquote> \r\nI meant all the glyphs in that particular font file. It should
    preferably be a PDF file(not a great fan of printing, unless it is absolutely
    essential)"

    get it here:\r\nhttps://github.com/houseind/robothon/tree/master/GlyphProofer\r\n\r\nYou
    can add several fonts (eg. all the upright fonts of the same family) and have
    each glyph render as a string of the weights of the fonts you have added."

  body: I vaguely remember doing this once... first exported the glyphs to EPS with
    FontLab (select glyphs, File > Export > EPS), then used something else to batch
    convert EPS to PDF (probably a Mac/Unix shell script).
