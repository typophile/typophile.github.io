  lettering (about a dozen letters in all) in an early 1900's enamel advertisment
  for chocolate.  A sampling of work to date is shown below.  All feedback greatfully
  received...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clementhorpe-_5753.jpg]"

  body: "I think a lot of the forms are very appealing, and I definitely think the
    style and feel of the original translates nicely.\r\n\r\nMy issues with it involve
    some of the vertical strokes, especially on the lowercase. A lot of them just
    seem too thick and weight the letter one way or the other, like with the \"p.\"
    I'm also not a big fan of the \"S,\" I think the upward bulge in the bottom curve
    is just a bit much.\r\n\r\nThese are the first impressions of a novice typophile,
    so take them for what they're worth. A well-executed revival, I say!"

  body: The LC z looks...awkward. And the quote marks need a bit more of the "hand-brushed"
    feel that you have going throughout the rest of the characters. I really like
    the leg of your UC R though. That's pretty!

  body: Actually-the quote marks re a mistake-the actual ones aren't done yet and
    my proof document has added in default ones! On reflection I think know what you
    mean about the 'z'.....  I'm still trying to decide what to do with that one.  Thnks
    for the comments :)
