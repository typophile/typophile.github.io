body: "I apologize if I'm missing something major, but I've spent the night searching
  Google and this forum and haven't really felt like I've found the information to
  satisfy my questions.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'm a design student currently, so I'm working
  on drinking up as much information as I can now, but I may be drowning &mdash; please
  educate me! I've come from a web design background, and now as I learn more about
  typography, I want to apply that knowledge back to the web by way of embedded fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm
  really interested by the idea, which technically isn't provided by many browsers
  at this point (I can only find Safari and older versions of MS Internet Explorer
  supporting it. I'm not sure if IE has continued support of embedding) but I'm also
  concerned with the legality of it. I've found many fonts that I've found have provisions
  for embedding in their licenses, but they tend to refer to PDF and Flash embedding.
  The only typeface I've found (that I would use) that specifically mentions embedding
  on the web in it's license is [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium|Gentium]],
  which looks like a decent serif, when your choices are between Times New Roman and
  Georgia.\r\n\r\nWhere I get confused is things like [[https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=MYRW10005000|Myriad
  Web]] (It looks like that link needs an Adobe account to access) and a few other
  fonts Adobe sells with a &#8220;Web&#8221; suffix. I understand that the embedding
  policy on that font is listed as &#8220;Editable,&#8221; which is generally pretty
  open, but I've yet to find a definitive answer as to whether that allows web embedding.\r\n\r\nI
  assume &mdash; it does say &#8220;web&#8221; in it's name &mdash; that web embedding
  is allowed, but when I assume, I tend to be wrong. So, somebody please educate me
  on the legalities of embedding."

    use. The way font embedding works in Safari is not allowed for commercial fonts,
    since you need to upload the fonts on a public server.'

  body: "Alex, really the only advice anyone can say with any certainty is \"read
    the license\" - some font embedding applications and tools respect embedding permissions
    encoded within OpenType and TrueType fonts, others ignore these permissions. However
    the permission bits only talk about embedding the font within a document file,
    and don't talk about what you can do with that document - only the EULA can give
    a full picture. If the EULA isn't clear ask the designer/foundry. \r\n\r\nBeth,
    some EULAs prohibit server based rendering where the user interacts indirectly
    with the font. \r\n"

  body: "<cite>Ralf, am I correct that server-side image generation from a font is
    kosher?</cite>\r\n\r\nA typical EULA is based on the assumtion the font is used
    by a limited number of users on local machines. Web uses are always a different
    thing. Some vendors don't allow such uses at all, some require an additional web
    license. So most of the time, it is not kosher. "

  body: "<cite>Or am I misunderstanding?</cite>\r\n\r\nNo, you don't. \r\nThe problem
    is where to draw the line. The images could be created by dozens of users in the
    backend of  content management system. Or every page request by thousands of users
    could create new images (with dynamic texts). Or the server could be used to create
    high-res images, for example for an online t-shirt printing service. These are
    things the that can't be covered with a typical license for 20 bucks. That's why
    many foundries rather prohibit server use alltogether in their standard EULA."
