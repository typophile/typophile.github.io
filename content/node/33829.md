  everyone who comments and criticises the attached drafts for my freelance project...\r\n\r\nIt
  is for a gallery in NY, a new exhibition space for Contemporary Art. The new Gallery
  space is going to allow in a \"contemporary context\" other curators to showcase
  their works varying from Art Brut to Outsider Art and New media Arts to innovative
  Art productions...\r\n\r\nThese are my first ideas/drafts on the job. I would like
  to hear your opinions and constructive critiques. I very much appreciate your time
  and valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAyse\r\n"

    of the floor. Museums always seem very modular to me. But, the typeface use for
    \"space\"\u2014News Gothic?\u2014seem counter to the feel of the mark."

    body: "Dear Tiffany,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your thoughts. Yes the conception
      derived from the modularity of space and architectural wide planes/floors of
      contemporary galleries. I was impressed by The Tate Modern's spacious galleries
      and i was thinking very much about them when i was designing. The \"space\"
      typeface is not News Gothic but Franklin Gothic Book. \r\n\r\n* Thank you Tim
      for your insights. I will consider them and post reviews asap.\r\n\r\n* Thank
      you Patricia. I liked somehow the embedded Cross in the center of the 4th piece.\r\n\r\n*As
      for the 2nd piece i have some earlier drafts distinguishing AE from one another
      I'll review it and post later. \r\n"

  body: "While 3 and 4 have a Piet Mondrian effect, which I am not sure works with
    the contemporary, they need some work to make them more apparent as AE, combining
    upper and lower case (4) doesn't really work for me especially when ae could work
    in lowercase, while 3 is a bit too FF. 5 and 6 are a little too obvious and they
    seem as if I have seen them before or at least the essence of them. 1 and 2 seem
    to have the most mileage in developing they both are a little severely geometric
    and I am not keen on the use of Helvetica for SPACE in 2. I hope you don't find
    this harsh, welcome btw.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I'd be careful with image 4 - it has an embedded cross in the negative space.\r\n\r\nI'd
    stay away from the @ symbol unless you really want to stress the net-art aspect.\r\n\r\n#2
    reads as AF to me, not AE\r\n\r\nI like #1 but am not sure I read the \"a\" that
    well."

    be careful with that cross on 4 - maybe thinner lines?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't go with
    the @ symbol, its just everywhere nowadays.\r\n\r\nI read number 3 as AF.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sorry if this wasan't helpful, but New York museums just remind me of Tobias Frere-Jones's
    work. :/"

  body: "Hello again,\r\n\r\nHere are the second drafts after your comments and my
    clients requests as well. (I have attached the 2nd Draft to the 1st post)\r\n\r\n*
    I had to eliminate the 3rd one, however i did try my best, somehow it wasn't a
    strong proposal in between the others.\r\n\r\n* I did minor tweaks and colour
    changes \"earthy tones\" on 1st-2nd\r\n\r\n* As 4th design, my client liked it
    very much and wanted some alternatives on the same conception eg. \"soft corners
    and earth \r\ncolours\" so you will see 2 extra proposals with the same concept."
