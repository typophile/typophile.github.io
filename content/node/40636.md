body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of designing a student newspaper (Studentbladet
  www.stbl.fi). It's about 20 pages in size. Size of the paper is A3 roughly.\r\n\r\nNow
  I'm looking for header and body text fonts. I'm thinking about useing four diffrent
  fonts, two sans-serif for header and body text, two sans for smaller column headers
  and text.\r\n\r\nYou can find last years editions in PDF files here http://www.stbl.fi/tidning/.
  I'm going to redo pretty much everything since I and the rest of the new staff don't
  agree with the current layout.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated
  since I'm new to designing a newspaper. Specially type, suggestions on good readable
  sans and sans-serifs for print.\r\n\r\n\r\npeter"

  body: I think if your paper is North American, you really should look at a serif
    face for the text. Very few newspapers here use sans for text. I would also be
    very careful about mixing different text faces. You are better to keep to one
    family for the text weights. It would be acceptable to find a pair of complementary
    sans families for heading applications.

  body: "It's not North American and it shouldn't matter.\r\n\r\nAfter looking around
    some more I think I'll go with one serif for main articles headlines and body
    text and a sans for smaller columns headlines and body text. I'm also considering
    a third font for vignettes to certain articles that always occur in the paper
    with some added graphic elements.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm leaning towards Caslon
    or maybe Jenson."

  body: "Trim size, number of columns, and measure (as I'm sure you know) can demand
    a face that will set conservatively. Low x-height will also be tough to handle
    well in smaller point sizes. I would like to see a sample design if you have time
    to post.\r\n\r\nYou might slug in some [[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/free.php|Lido]]
    for reference if the Caslon and Jenson are not working like you would want.\r\n"
