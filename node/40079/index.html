  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was reading a book last night when it occurred to me that I didn't know what font was used. Probably something basic like Times or Garamond. But I didn't *know*.

It also occurred to me that I was glad I didn't know, because if I did it might drive me to distraction. I might be thinking of the font, not the words I was reading.

Anyone else find some truth in that?

<em>I might be thinking of the font, not the words I was reading.</em>
patty's right -- although we may always think of the type (because, jeez, it's what we do), the only time it's a problem or interuptive is when the type has been used inappropriately or poorly. i would guess a horticulturist would look at a landscape, mentally noting the plants but appreciating the <em>garden.</em> but if something's wrong, it might stick out leaving him distracted and wondering. "why are the ferns next to the cacti?"</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you're a designer or typographer, or just interested in type, it pretty much goes with the territory that you'll note the type used in anything you read, or try to figure it out if you don't recognize it offhand. But as Patty says, this doesn't interfere with reading unless the type (or the typesetting) is bad. My wife likes to test me: she'll have a book out of a library, hand it to me, and ask me was the typeface is. But she will get annoyed when opens up something like an art book to a specific page and say's "Look at this!" I study it carefully for a minute, then announce the body type is Monotype Baskerville and the captions are Gill Sans. She sighs. "The picture! What do you think of the painting?"</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it enhances my reading experience when comprehension rests on visible  differences. When there's a high frequency in a story of an inner voice set in italics, I consciously appreciate a face with a distinctive old-fashioned italic that keeps me from getting confused. I like it when manuals set off command terms from the text with an entirely different face. I like the bottomless timbre conjured in my mind when Death speaks in small caps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe "you read best what you read most". Trough the years I've read so many books set in Simoncini Garamond&mdash;the default of most italian publishers&mdash;that I don't notice it anymore. There are some book faces that are a bit distracting to me, like Perpetua and Electra&mdash;even when properly set&mdash;because I stop to read to look at the letterforms.
