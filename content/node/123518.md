  I\u2019ve seen this elsewhere, but I can\u2019t pin it down. It\u2019s a little
  similar to fonts that are called Lombardic, but it much less flowing. Can anyone
  identify it?"

    builder rather than being copied direct from a font. As you note it's similar
    to Lombardic. The medial spurs and Tuscan terminals make it a true Victorian Frankenfont.\r\nFor
    digital fonts with some similarity to the Lombardic design you could also check
    for fonts tagged uncial, medieval, illuminated, Irish, medieval and Celtic.\r\nI
    posted a fairly comprehensive set of links to this genre of fonts in http://typophile.com/node/123144\r\nDon"

    as such. I wonder though if they did work from some kind of examples.\r\n\r\nI
    knew there was something incongruous about it all, but as frankenfonts go I don\u2019t
    find it too appalling. I don\u2019t need to reproduce it. I was just doing some
    research on the history of the building\u2014some of the descriptions of early
    picture shows there are quite amusing."

  body: "I agree that the letters say Victorian neo-gothic whimsy more than appalling.\r\nIn
    my opinion, there is nothing wrong with a Frankenfont if the mash-up creates a
    coherent mood.\r\nThey would work quite well for a dragons/steampunk/Harry Potter
    milieu. \r\nPerhaps the letters will inspire a lettering artist or fontmaker to
    venture a full alphabet.\r\nDon "
