body: "I bought my first wireless mouse yesterday... Kensington PilotMouse Laser.\r\n\r\nhttp://us.kensington.com/html/7195.html\r\n\r\nThe
  biggest selling point for me wasn't the laser technology or the wireless, but the
  comfort of the design.  It has these squishy rubber \"gills\" along the sides.  Kinda
  like a Koosh toy or a BMX handlebar grip.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to share my ergonomic
  bliss.  What other gear is everyone diggin on these days?"

    - it certainly took some getting used to, but I can''t imagine working without
    it now. '
