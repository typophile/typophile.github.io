  body: Awright, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8651.html?1050565799"
    target="_blank"> you all know the drill</a>. Adriano&#39;s birthday  <BR>present
    will be up for download for a little under  <BR>36 hours. Grab it while you can.
    Enjoy, but keep it  <BR>off the music-sharing websites or I&#39;ll hunt you down  <BR>and
    redefine the meaning of suffering. If you like it  <BR>let me know. If you don&#39;t
    too. I can take it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
