  body: Another important aspect to look at is the nature of customer support offered.
    The main reason why people fail in any web design service has been attributed
    to miscommunication. Communication is a very important aspect in service provision.
    If there is misunderstanding, the end results will be below expectation. A person
    should, therefore, take time in considering the nature of customer support rendered
    by a web design company before confining to their packages. Look at their telephone
    support center as well as their promptness in responding to emails. If in doubt,
    it is highly recommended to arrange an appointment with the company. This will
    give firsthand experience on the nature of customer support rendered.

    at all. A stylized image may be complemented by a similarly stylized type, if
    one can identify the style, which I did in this case as \u201Cmelted\u201D.\r\n\r\nIf
    you take a sharp typeface and blur it, then adjust the sliders to make it high
    contrast with no grey, you end up with a melted effect like Ketchupa. (Thermography
    produces the effect quite literally.)\r\n\r\nIf you take a greyscale image of
    a face, and adjust the sliders to high contrast with no grey, you end up with
    a melted image like that of the OP.\r\n\r\nI had a go with your avatar and Souvenir
    Demibold seemed to work quite well, better than Ketchupa\u2014the trick seems
    to be too relate the B/W proportion and the scale of detail of the typeface with
    that of the image, and that is not guesswork but a matter of skill and taste.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dean_6661.png]"
