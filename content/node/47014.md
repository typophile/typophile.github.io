  body: "The typeface in the sample is ITC Uptight Regular. It had a lot of alternate
    characters and some of them are used here. ITC Uptight Neon is similar, except
    that the ends of the strokes are all rounded, like neon lights. It also didn't
    have as many character variations.\r\n\r\nAn aside: An illustrator I used to know
    told me that the guy who designed Uptight Regular and Uptight Neon shared studio
    space with him in Minneapolis in the early Seventies. I don't remember what his
    name was, though."
