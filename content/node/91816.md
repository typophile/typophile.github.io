  chance to see a screening of the documentary \"Linotype: The Film\" a few months
  ago, and it was excellent! I thought it was better than the documentary \"Helvetica,\"
  with the addition of some wit and charm. If you are in the Baltimore area, check
  it out on May 3rd! I hope to see you there!\r\n\r\nhttp://bmorelinotypethefilm.eventbrite.com\r\n\r\nBaltimore,
  Maryland\r\nThursday, May 3, 2012 \u2013 5:30pm to 9:00pm\r\n\r\nBaltimore Museum
  of Industry\r\n1415 Key Highway, Baltimore, MD 21230\r\n\r\nCome see a Linotype
  in action! There will be refreshments and discussion about the impact of the Linotype
  before and after the film. All proceeds of the event to go towards the renovation
  of the Mergenthaler wall displayed in the main Gallery at the Baltimore Museum of
  Industry.\r\n\r\nPresented by: AIGA Baltimore, ASMP Baltimore, the Litho Club of
  Baltimore, the Production Club of Baltimore, and the PGAMA.\r\n\r\nScreenings in

    assorted typophiles in the audience, including several Linotype operators and
    people interviewed in the film. Had a wonderful time.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm not sure
    I would say it was \"better\" than the Helvetica film. It was very good, certainly,
    and sometimes very funny and entertaining. But whereas \"Helvetica\" used a typeface
    as a metaphor (or window into) the much bigger issue of the importance of type
    throughout the world, \"Linotype\" really just told a collection of specific stories
    about specific people, and never seemed to resolve itself into making a point
    about anything larger. Which isn't necessarily a weakness, and perhaps when I
    see it again (of course I'm getting the DVD) I might feel differently."
