  set.  The intentions are that of a display face for titles and labels.  I have tried
  to build alternate characters with the intention that they be used as MINIMAL accents
  to the Regular face.   <BR>Please feel free to comment'

  body: I like this a lot. Especially the flavor of the alternates. <BR> <BR>In Rouge
    Reg. <BR> <BR>I see some little incongruities &#40;flatness in the top of the
    lc d&#39;s counter - compare with g, the fleck at the tip of the lc k&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>UC A - more air in the counter? <BR> <BR>the lc k&#39;s arm feels cramped,
    id open it up a bit <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also not too fond of the number 4 <BR> <BR>I
    feel uncomfortable posting in these forums, because im just a beginner, but those
    are some of my thoughts. <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: Hi Jeremy, <BR> <BR>I like it. In Rouge Alt the &#34;W&#34; is a little to
    wide for me. <BR> <BR>Rene

  body: Neato! It is very &#39;dark&#39;. Perhaps the wild west gone a  <BR>little
    goth. I agree with Andrew- the UC A and SC A  <BR>need some air to breath, drop
    the crossbar a little. The  <BR>SC W looks too wide, snap it into shape. Original,
    to my  <BR>eyes. Good show old bean!

  body: I like this. Lots of fun options too. <BR> <BR>I like to think of type &#40;in
    one sense&#41; like legos, something you can play/build with. The more options/pieces
    you have, the greater variety of things you can build. Something like that. <BR>
    <BR>I would consider smoothing out the swash decenders/ascenders in the alternate
    set. Some of them are nice and smooth &#40;like the A&#41;, but most seem to have
    some anchor-point bumps in there. I attached an image, so hopefully you&#39;ll
    see what I mean. Granted, they are tricky to get out, but resolving this makes
    your face much more professional. <BR> <BR>Have you made any progress since posting
    this? <BR> <BR>r. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16721.gif"

  body: This is pretty cool. <BR> <BR>Ryan, those are probably Flash distortions to
    the outlines. They might be cured by exporting as TT and/or defining the inflection
    points explicitly. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    the wisdom you all share. And I really appreciate some fresh eyes looking at it,
    I&#39;m way too close to it to see some of it&#39;s problems.   <BR>In answer

  body: i&#39;m surprised no one mentioned the Q. that&#39;s the first thing i noticed
    when i looked at the regular version. that tiny tail doesn&#39;t make it instantly
    recognizable as a Q. very cool stuff.
