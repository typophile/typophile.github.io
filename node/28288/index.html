  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm a violinist who is also a self-publisher, and I recently asked a friend of mine (a book designer) "What's up with all the slab fonts everywhere?"  He suggested that I contact this forum.  So that's what I'm doing.

It seems that I started to see them a few years back when Martha Stewart LIVING commissioned its slab, Archer.  Ever since then, slabs seem to be popping up more and more.  What's it all about?  Was Martha Stewart an instigator--THE instigator--in this?  Or was she picking up on a trend she saw coming.  Because slabs are very now.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the present era of new genres such as deconstructed, techno, pixel, distressed, etc., and with the dominance of the sans serif, the subtle distinctions between historic serif genres (old style, transitional, didone) have become relatively unimportant, and the more extreme variants such as slabs have assumed greater typographic significance for art directors.

Archer may have been influential, due to MSL use.
However, TheSerif (1994) was well used editorially before Archer, and Clarendon began to return to favor ten years ago.
I designed an "old style' slab serif type, Bodoni Egyptian, in 1999, it seemed like a niche that needed filling.</div>

While there are underlying cultural/psychological reasons why slabs might be appealing right now, I think obvious one is that they were underused for a long time. Art directors, always in search of variety/novelty, rediscovered slabs -- just as they've rediscovered scripts of late.</div>

I wouldn't know cos i was too young. But what comes to mind when i think of type in the 90s is that David Carson/Garage Fonts style and Emigre. They were all abit shaky, rigid and too messed up.

I think slabs are a solid, heavy and sure answer to 90s type. 

Actually i think all present design is a reaction to the 90s. I don't think it was a particularly good decade for graphic design. Unlike the 2000s which have been amazing so far.</div>

Sure, when something goes out of fashion, it falls hard.
But there's more to this than fashion, and with a greater historical awareness I think you will come to realize what a remarkable time for typography and design the late '80s and early 1990s were. You could start by getting a few of the Emigre magazines from that period and reading about the issues that were being addressed.</div>

Among the slabs that I like are Chapparal and Gill's Joanna. The latter has just the right color. Ooh, has there been a revival for that type? It was used in <em>An Essay on Typography's</em> opening chapter, wasn't it?</div>

Chapparal is probably the only slab that has optical sizes. I do have to say that it's really versatile, though it's not exactly a Scala-kind-of-workhorse.

By to by, where can I find Scala printed on low grade paper, guys? For some reason, Whole Foods printed matters is all-matte.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Chapparal is probably the only slab that has optical sizes.</em>

This begs the question of how a slab is defined:
1. Squared-off structure.
2. Thickness.

Many didones could be considered a slab according to 1.
And many thick-serifed faces with wedge serifs (eg TheSerif} or bracketed serifs (eg Clarendon) fit definition 2.

Bauer and Berthold Bodoni at display size are very slabbish, whereas ITC Bodoni, never is, even the small text size set big. I have used the Bauer and Berthold in combo as an "optically-scaled" Bodoni.

I found that Scala was a good text face up to about 9 pt., then it started to get a bit clunky. Of course, that was 10 years ago, and my experience might be different now, what with different glasses, the march of fashion, and my own changing tastes and ways of setting type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Do you guys think it has anything to do with an increase in sidebars in newspapers, magazines, and books? The old need for two types (headline/heading and text) becomes three (headline/heading, text, and sidebar heading), and slab serifs offer a compatible but distinctive type for the latter? 

If so, that might be seen as an effect of the "hypertextification" of text in print media.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I doubt that an increase in sidebars has much to do with it. There are plenty of non-slab faces being used in magazines; I'm pretty sure that the majority of sidebars I've seen lately aren't slabs.

I think slab faces may be the flip side of the trend toward ornamental design. Fette Fraktur and Zapfino Extra are huge pop-culture trends, floral ornamentation and Prussian/Russian crests are everywhere, and splatters of ink and paint have are finally tired. In the face of all that, it makes sense for an anti-pop designer to use a simple slab for display without just digging out Univers/Helvetica/AG/et al.

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm, i think that both sides of the arguments are true. While i've seen that slabs have been used in titles for that extra decorative, industrial-age punch (or not), it also have been set in a lot of body texts, particularly in lighter weights, to connote humble, organic stylishness.

I'd say that, in text situation, slab is the new humanist sans.</div>

Or rather the non-specific, if the definitions are refined enough only one font per category remains.

TheSerif is a slab face in my view, but the serifs aren't wedge, which for me would be something like Albertus or Copperplate.
