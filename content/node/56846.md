  The \"n\" and the \"e\" are killin me. i feel it has the right feel but my weights
  seem off.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-4_6614.jpg]"

  body: It has a nice feel but the 'v' to 'a' join needs a bit of smoothing out, it
    makes a square profile which doesn't sit comfortably with the circular shapes
    of the other letters.

  body: "Personally I like the <strong>n</strong> with all 3 terminals curved. \r\nHave
    you tried an <strong>e</strong> with the cross-stroke curving on the right where
    it joins the round stroke? Everything else is so smooth and rounded, that one
    corner stands out because it's the only pointy thing. "

  body: "This looks nice! Though I agree about the \"va\" join and the pointiness
    of the nose of the \"e\". Re the latter, maybe also try just adding a curve on
    the outer contour to soften the corner itself?\r\nAlso, in the \"t\", the lack
    of curves on the terminal of the tail seems odd. Not sure about the crossbar.
    All in all the \"t\" seems surprisingly \"angular\" to me.\r\n\r\nBTW: Might the
    crossbar of the \"e\" be a bit heavier than the curve (especially the top curve)?
    Not sure which way is best to fix it though. Maybe compare the \"e\" to the \"o\"
    again, the \"o\" seems heavier?"

    the 'e''s crossbar similar to the v-a connection?"

  body: "the problem with the e is on the right side of the top bowl. it's too pointy
    at the corner and too flat at the 1-2 o-clock part of the curve. \r\n\r\nthe curved
    terminals are cute. they would work better if they were consistent in their direction
    and application. try writing the name on paper a few times with a brush or a marker
    or something then pay attention how the terminals look. if you don't do anything
    else, at least add your curvey things to the crossbar and tail of the t.\r\n\r\nif
    you want to have this thing spaced so tightly, consider getting rid of the left
    side of the t's crossbar. \r\n\r\nlastly, that's a bad place for the registered
    mark. you want it out of the way, somewhere I'm not going to notice it. "

  body: "First of all thank you everyone for your immense help. I've taken all your
    comments to heart and tried pretty much everything you mentioned. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-4_4907.png]\r\n\r\nSpecifically\r\n<b>e</b>:
    I agree they seemed pointy at the 1-2o-clock part of the curve. I adjusted drastically
    to see the differences, and came up with a minor change that i think works.\r\n\r\n<b>n</b>:
    I wasn't too sure about the 3 curved terminals, but they have grown on me.\r\n\r\n<b>o<b/>:
    Thinned it out a little to help with the balance of the \"e\" however i may thin
    it out a little more.\r\n\r\n<b>va</b>: Completely agreed with the \"boxy\" shape
    and completed the curves. Still not sure if the weights are perfect yet.\r\n\r\n<b>t</b>:
    The t, frankly has been the hardest i wanted something more custom with a little
    flair to it so this is what i came up with - everyone inhouse likes the added
    well... whatcha think?\r\n\r\n<b>\xA9</b>: I completely agree, still not sure
    where to put it. Kinda like its place ment here.\r\n\r\n\r\nRip it apart one last
    time folks, i really appreciate the help!\r\n"

  body: "There's something bothering my a bit about the left stroke of the V. \r\nIt's
    hard to say exactly, it could be the bottom terminal that does it,\r\nbut somehow
    this stroke feels more stagnant and blocky to me than the rest\r\nof the letters.\r\n\r\nI
    tried reversing the top terminal of that V. Maybe (?) this helps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-4_49072_5779.png]"
