  body: "In contemporary types Didones usually have flat serifs and Bodonis usually
    have tapered serifs. But there are exceptions, because Bodoni\u2019s later types
    are very similar to Didot family\u2019s work."

  body: "This is almost an odd question to me, since there are relatively few Didots
    compared to the amount of Bodonis. Frutiger's Didot, H&FJ's Didot and Porchez's
    Ambroise seem to be the only actual Didots available. Canada Type has their new
    Didot, but it's self admittedly not a faithful Didot.\r\n\r\nAm I completely missing
    out on some cool Modern types?"

  body: "Nick, I have compared quite a few bodonis with didots. I am just yet to figure\r\nout
    the essence of a didot as against that of a bodoni. In many versions\r\nthe serifs
    of didots are very similar to a bodoni. I know the key charachter\r\ndifferences,
    like the lowercase a and g are dead giveaways, but in capitals,\r\n(used in magazine
    covers) at times I find it hard to tell if it is a bodoni \r\nor a didot, especially
    when one cant really see if the serifs are flat or tapering.\r\n"

  body: "One definite difference I just remembered: when a hairline meets a serif
    (at the top of a U  or W, or bottom of an A, for instance), in Bodoni it's bracketed,
    in Didot it's not.\r\n"
