  point upwards, with the middle segment almost horizontal. So I designed a tilde
  like that. Of course, a spacing tilde should have the more common angle (for use
  in URLs, mathematics, etc.).\r\n\r\nBut I have two worries. The first is that the
  tilde on my \"n\" doesn't match the others. Does Spanish use a tilde on other characters?
  What about Spanish words in other-language texts? Will it look awkward?\r\n\r\nMy
  other worry is other languages that use the ntilde. Are there any? Is the Spanish-style
  acceptable/correct in these languages?\r\n\r\nI know OpenType allows one to specify
  language-specific substitutions. Should I use them? What software actually implements
  this?\r\n\r\nLastly, have I got the shapes right?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tilde_4199.png]"

  body: "I can answer only a couple of your questions, because I speak for Spanish,
    only. \r\n\r\n1. Does Spanish use a tilde on any other characters? No. Just the
    N. I am fairly certain that Portuguese uses a tilde on either the a or the o,
    but you'll have to consult a Portuguese speaker on that one. \r\n\r\n2. I'd be
    curious to read more about the idea that the tilde should \"point up.\" The example
    you show of a tilde over the n seems to be \"flying away.\" It doesn't look right
    to me. The tilde example you show over the a looks more like what I would expect
    to see over an \xF1 in Spanish. \r\n\r\nHope that helps get the conversation rolling. "

    do think the version above is a little extreme, and I've shortened the end strokes

    not read that on Typophile, but this I can tell you \u2014 15 or so years ago,
    when the Spanish-speaking market was embracing the new technologies for news,
    magazine and book publishing, (and Font Bureau was embracing back), I had a note
    passed onto me from a famous Spanish-speaking artist who had been using some of
    our fonts to compose a book. He was pleased our tildes did not look like \"the
    _________ ones from Adobe which seem to be 'flying away'\".\r\n\r\nWith no Spanish-speaking
    clients complaining against a 'running' tilde since then, I came to the conclusion
    that the flying tilde may be proper for calligraphic or historic designs, but
    perhaps not for typographic designs. With the addition of the low-resolution/poor-print-quality
    appearance of a running tilde proving unique-r amongst the accents than the flying
    tilde, our die was/is cast. \r\n\r\nBut as always, if a 'special' is needed by
    anyone, in any of our fonts, for any language, we're happy to oblige whatever
    local designs apply.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    thing.  I need to update my blog posting as I've collected more examples to show
    in the past few months and also to simply clarify my position.  But it's important
    to note it's primarily about the tilde in Spanish.  Other languages, as I noted,
    probably (surely) have different traditions.\r\n\r\nBoth of your tildes are fine
    to me though I'd move the one on the n a little more to the right.  Probably best
    though to go for something in between the two but that depends on what your tilde
    and acute are based on. The thing to avoid is one which appears to be heavily
    slanted the other way (even though the curves are properly placed).\r\n\r\nAs
    to do a language based swap, I know of handwriting fonts that do that for a number
    of differention langauge's diacritics, including making the \xF1 a macron, or
    in German making the umlaut a macron (or was it more like a tilde?  I forget).

    posted a while ago. One of the pages presents digitized books <a href="http://purl.pt/index/livro/date/PT/index.html"
    target="_blank">in chronological order</a>. Clicking through some of the books,
    my impression is that the "flying tilde" was the norm (e.g. in books from <a href="http://purl.pt/14441/1/P13.html"
    target="_blank">1573</a>, <a href="http://purl.pt/13832/2/P8.html" target="_blank">1728</a>,
    <a href="http://purl.pt/14440/1/P34.html" target="_blank">1757</a>) and only shortly
    before 1900, in books typeset in classicistic type, the shape got more 'symmetrical'
    as is obviously expected today (e.g. <a href="http://purl.pt/1341/1/P11.html"
    target="_blank">1838</a>).

    on how to design the tilde sign. Even if you think on a typeface for \u2014let's
    say\u2014 spanish language purposes. Only tradition could fit in order to reach
    to a conclusion. And common sense, of course!\r\nMy opinion is that a pointed
    upwards tilde is not very suitable and quite odd.\r\nAnyway, we could find a pointed
    upwards tilde sample (for lowercase n) in the punches cut by Geronimo Gil, around
    mid XVIII century in Spain. I believe, it is because of calligraphic influences
    on his type work.\r\nFurthermore, there shouldn't be any difference between spanish
    and portuguese \"tilde\" sign. Although it is better to design different versions
    for upper and lower cases (in order to fit better with the width and weight of
    the characters \u2018n\u2019 and \u2018N\u2019).\r\nBest,  andreu\r\n"
