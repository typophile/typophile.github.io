  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Has anyone at Typophile ever designed something to be harder to read on purpose&ndash;to make sure the reader slows down, and thus better understands the text? In particular, has anyone ever done this with a textbook or other educational materials? Or has anyone made another design decision with a similar effect, such as printing the text in light gray?</p>
<p>Note: there is some empirical research suggesting that using more difficult typefaces can increase comprehension. Dan Kahneman discusses some of it in Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow, and a very recent example is the new study described here, which finds increased gains for dyslexic readers:</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the studies, but generally speaking designers make something harder to read if their clients  want to discourage folks from reading it. For example, in annual reports bad news is sometimes put in dense paragraphs of all caps, with numbers spelled out, making it harder to read.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That Arial is easy and Monotype Corsiva is hard to read is just an assumption the teachers did make. Maybe Corsiva is more readable because it&rsquo;s an italic, maybe because the letter forms are more differentiated than in Arial. The same results could be argued to just prove the opposite, that Corsiva is more readable and thus the pupils' comprehension was better.</p>

<p>Jens, I haven&rsquo;t read the study cited in the news article and can&rsquo;t vouch for its research design. But it&rsquo;s not the only one&ndash;I mentioned Kahneman&rsquo;s secondary work, and Chris listed other studies. I don&rsquo;t care about the details of this study (or the dyslexia vs. general population point). I&rsquo;m interested in the general principle.</p>

<p>Speed/slowness and ease/difﬁculty are not the parameters I use for typeface design or typographic design. I prefer not play the game according to those rules.</p>
<p>The following example isn’t “text type” per se, which is what some say should be optimally decoded at rapid speed prior to comprehension, but poetry, where the idea is to savour the words. That principle applies to prose, too, although to a lesser extent.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A quick review for those who don’t have database access (or don’t want to pay $40.USD to download it).</p>
<p>For starters, the authour’s and those who administered the tests are middle-school teachers, not research scientists.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Subjects (Ss)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
275 students in Years 9–11 (age range= 13–16 years).
Mean and standard deviation not reported.
Ss were previously grouped into four “bands” by Middle Years Information System tests.
Some were diagnosed with Dyslexya, but there was no agreed upon definition, nor were they diagnosed by the same person with the same methods. Uncontrolled.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Experimental design<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Between Ss. Each group of Ss only received one condition (font—Arial or Monotype Corsiva).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Methods<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Double blind study. Neither the experimenter (a teacher) nor Ss knew what condition they were about to administer/receive. During a 40 minute lesson of students copying material from the blackboard and answering questions from a textbook Ss were stopped, and shown a powerpoint slide. It contained the following text:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The line-breaks can not be discerned from the figure presented in the paper.</p>
<p>Ss were given 90 seconds to read the text in silence. The lesson continued. Approximately 35 minutes later, they were administered the following questions:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In which constellation is it? 
Cassiopeia/Cancer/Capricorn/Pavo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of star is it?
White Dwarf/Red Dwarf/Red Giant/White Giant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many times the mass of the Sun is it?
Half/Double/Ten Times/Five Times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the temperature on its surface?
Twelve Kelvin/Twelve Thousand Kelvin/Twelve Thousand Centigrade/Three Thousand Kelvin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is it mostly made up of?
Carbon/Helium/Iron/Cadmium</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have we found planets orbiting it?
Yes/No<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They were on paper. Their typographic design is not reported.
121 Ss saw Arial, 154 saw Monotype Corsiva.
Ss were grouped into two groups by random balanced assignment—random assignment followed by re-grouping Ss to ensure that each group had a similar percentage of Ss from all bands, including readers with Dyslexia.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Results<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Across bands, and including dyslexic readers,  Ss who saw Monotype Corsiva scored 12.8% higher. This was statistically significant.
Within bands, excluding dyslexic readers, the mean difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 11.5%. This was statistically significant.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The interesting part of the results<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Across bands, the difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 12.8%. Within bands, the mean difference was 11.5%. However, when looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> readers with dyslexia, the difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 19%. While arithmetically different from the overall difference, it was not statiscically significant.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In one sentence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
When students with Dyslexia saw a slide with a passage of text set in Monotype Corsiva compared to Arial , they performed significantly better on a short comprehension test, but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->difference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> between their scores was not significantly greater than the difference between the scores of  students without Dyslexia.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A nice short and easy to read article. however, it is full of confounds and impossible to reproduce from the paper. In the concluding remarks of Diemand-Yauman et al. (2010, pp 4), they state “The potential for improving educational practices through cognitive interventions is immense. If a simple change of font can significantly increase student performance, one can only imagine the number of beneficial cognitive interventions waiting to be discovered. Fluency demonstrates how small interventions have the potential to make big improvements in the performance of our students and education system as a whole.”</p>
<p>This is an great example of non-scientists testing disfluency theory, and a testament at how easy it may be to implement these techniques in real-world settings, for which they should be applauded.</p>

<p>I can see how slowing down might increase comprehension when dealing with a few sentences. But would the same result happen when reading a whole book, or would people (like Thomas mentioned) simply give up?</p>
<p>A real-world example: If someone sends me a handwritten &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; note, I&rsquo;ll take the time to decipher the writing. But a few years ago someone showed me a handwritten 1800s diary of our church history. Even though the subject interested me, I gave up after a couple of pages because reading the handwriting was just too slow and difficult.</p>

<p>In the sample I posted, one typeface was set large, bold and solid, to represent “typical”, and the other small, italic and screened, to represent “hard to read”. So, it was not typefaces that were being compared, but settings, according to the prejudices of the researchers, who rigged the experiment to set one typeface so that it was “harder to read” than the other.</p>
<p>Without seeing the slides involved here, I can nonetheless state that the Arial setting will look really boring, just the kind of thing that would make students’ eyes glaze over and their minds wander, while the Corsiva setting will have a degree of novelty that warrants more attention.</p>
<p>As I pointed out in a previous thread, what is being compared is not, as the researchers believe, difficulty of typeface, but appropriateness of type choice and type specs, about which they are somewhat ignorant, because that ain’t their bailiwick.</p>
<p>So congratulations, they have discovered typography!</p>
<p>The researchers here are victims of the Beer Test phenomenon: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->a small amount of something unusual<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> will have immediate highlight appeal, but is not the kind of thing for prolonged consumption. Display Beer, as Hrant termed it.</p>
