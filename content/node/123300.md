  body: I think Nueva was once available in a multiple master format. It's possible
    that the weight of the type in the logo was creating using the mm font.

  body: "Good find Josev. \r\nNeuva was available in a multiple master format in the
    1990s but is now sold only as individual fonts. However, there are a large number
    of weights and several widths http://www.fonts.com/font/adobe/nueva#product_top\r\nNeueva
    includes true italics but they do not fit the logo.\r\nHere is Nueva Regular sloped
    11 degrees [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NuevaSloped11deg60pct_5948.jpg]\r\nCompare
    to the italic [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NuevaItalic60pct_5257.jpg]\r\nDon"
