  few weeks I've been getting no replies to emails, faxes, and the phone number seem
  to be not in service or forwarded to fax lines. \r\nAnyone know of a way for me
  to contact them, or someone I can get a hold of who's close to the school, or why

    kind of assignments do you get to do? I realise this is a broad question, maybe
    you can talk about what you're doing at the moment and tell us how it's going
    to be reviewed.\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "Hello Sebsan,\r\n\r\nYes you can apply if you don't have a background in
    type design.  The participants have a  broad range of backgrounds and interests.
    Not so specifically type design, but typographic design and a few with no formal
    design background at all. There seems to be a big emphasis on content and giving
    appropriate form to the content \u2013 whether it be self generated or given\r\n\r\nAt
    the moment my year are working on a 'reader' project which will eventuate in a
    book on the subject of biography \r\n\r\nAlso the WT is open to commision work,
    and every so often something comes in. For example a student here has just completed
    a series of stamps for the TPG Post. As for the review process, it is quite informal
    here, but we have an evaluation in december \u2013 so then I can tell you more!\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps,\r\nDavid"

    realize it's slightly delayed response :) but did you eventually? \r\n\r\nIf you
    did, I'd be grateful for any information on how the process went. I know from
    your blog that you went to KABK and not to the WT finally, but you may have gone
    through some of the earlier stages of admission...   "
