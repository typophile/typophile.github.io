  body: 'BJ -- <BR> <BR>1&#41; As JFP mentioned, there was a catalog published in
    conjunction with the traveling exhibit of Matthew Carter&#39;s work, <i>Typographically
    Speaking: The Art of Matthew Carter</i>. This included a complete checklist &#40;well,
    complete as of last year -- it doesn&#39;t include the most recent designs, like
    the Monticello revival&#41;. The checklist was compiled by Carter himself. <BR>
    <BR>John Berry wrote an article about the exhibit, which you can read at <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18099.html"
    target="_blank"> http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18099.html</a> <BR>
    <BR>The catalog may still be available. You can try contacting Cynthia Wayne,
    Curator of Exhibitions at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery -- e-mail: <a
    href="mailto:cwayne@umbc.edu">cwayne@umbc.edu</a> or telephone &#40;410&#41; 455-2270.
    I think the cost is $20 &#43; $3 S&amp;H. <BR> <BR>The checklist lists 72 designs,
    including the ITC Greeks. And the Shelleys are counted as one. <BR> <BR>Too bad
    you didn&#39;t inquire before doing all that googling. <BR> <BR>2&#41; The typeface

  body: Matthew mentions in his introduction that he doesn&#39;t include several faces
    that have been attributed to him but that he doesn&#39;t consider that he really
    designed -- including things like Auriol and Cochin and Optima Greek. But they
    show up in the index that I counted earlier. Go figure. <BR> <BR>He also omitted
    a couple designs that he did for corporate identities &#40;such as the one I think
    you are calling Airport in your list&#41; because they were never manufactured
    as fonts for typesetting, but instead only pasted up from photostats -- so he
    says. <BR> <BR>I see no mention of Century 725. Elephant was renamed Big Figgins
    for general release. He says New Baskerville is wrongly attributed to him; John
    Quaranta directed that one. The <i>Washington Post</i> Bodoni is called Postoni
    &#40;no &#39;d&#39;&#41;. He doesn&#39;t mention Rocky.  <BR> <BR>He did Ionic
    Number One in 1999 for Carter &amp; Cone. You&#39;re missing Wrigley for <i>Sports
    Illustrated</i>. He also includes the Manutius Latin supplement to Miller that
    he did for UCLA. There was Benton Bold Condensed for <i>Time</i>, Foreman Light
    for <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and Newsbaum for the New York <i>Daily News</i>.
    <BR> <BR>It is now clear to me that the index I counted earlier is not a definitive
    list -- it&#39;s just an index; and several entries are faces that he doesn&#39;t
    claim. So that 72 count I mentioned earlier is incorrect. I don&#39;t have the
    time to assemble a more definitive list from the 16-page specimen. <BR> <BR>But
    get the book. It&#39;s well worth it. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: bj <BR> <BR>I sent a post previously but it hasn&#39;t shown up. Probably
    hit the wrong button. <BR> <BR>One item you are missing is LeBe, a Hebrew that
    was used in the Pennyroyal Caxton Bible. Not available otherwise. There are also
    beta fonts that have been around for a while that have not appeared and probably
    won&#39;t until there is some commercial interest.  <BR> <BR>I was involved in
    the Manutius face mentioned by Kent. At the time Miller Text and Wilson Greek
    were in beta and we needed a roman/Greek face. Matthew configured them for us
    and also supplied every glyph we could find that existed in the 16th, 17th, and
    20th century. It grew to be quite a monster. It is no longer available. I wrote
    about the project in an issue of Printing History. The beta fonts I mentioned
    above were also discussed in the article. Not sure how Matthew felt about that
    so I will only refer you to the article. <BR> <BR>Skia was initially a QuickDraw
    GX font and had much more extrapolative potential &#40;amazingly so&#41; than
    what was eventually made available as a TrueType font. Might want to somehow deferentiate
    this?
