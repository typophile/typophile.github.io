body: "This should be a very easy one. I just need to know the font or fonts (if they
  are different) on my web page. The font is part of a template which I cannot change
  and there's no way for me to know exactly what it is (I don't know much about fonts,
  otherwise I would ID it myself).\r\n\r\nWhat I need to know is the font that is
  used at the top of each page where it says \"Botanica Atlanta Landscape Design\",
  the font used to the right at the top of the page where it says, in small letters,
  \"Landscape Design, Construction & Maintenance\", and the font used in the navigation
  menu on the left of the page.\r\n\r\nI have multiple fonts on this website and I
  want to change that so at least most of the text matches the headline font. Here's
  the address:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.botanicaatlanta.com\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nStuart"

    But what does this mean? Those are three different fonts, correct? Which one is
    it? Or is it Times like Jan said?"

    Arial; on a Mac, Helvetica; on Linux, maybe one or the other, or maybe something
    completely different, but definitely sans serif. If you want a definitive answer,
    grab a screenshot so we see what you see."

  body: I most assuredly see Arial there, Jan. Maybe your local browser settings override
    the site css?

    check the availability of those fonts on your computer in the order specified
    in this CSS property and display the element using the first font that is available.
    If you've got neither Arial nor Helvetica installed, then it will default to whatever
    sans-serif font is set as default on your machine.\r\n\r\n"
