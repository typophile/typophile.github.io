  be cool to get a cheeky preview of what you lovely people submitted.\r\n\r\nIts
  not necessarily a crit, just a place to see what different styles and variations
  you come up with. Feel free to comment how you wish tho.\r\n\r\nI went for a simple,
  circley, wiggly, snowman style :)\r\n\r\nAnd off course what a great thing the Font
  Aid team are doing to raise money for this tragedy. Good to know there's so many
  caring people out there.\r\n\r\n---\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snowman_6518.png]"

    designs from 37 different countries. \r\n\r\nChank Diesel is doing an amazing
    job behind the scenes putting the font together. The font will be sold for $20
    (same as Font Aid III) through several different font distributors. We\u2019ll
    announce which distributors once the contracts and plans are finalized. \r\n \r\nAll
    money raised will be donated to Doctors Without Borders to help with their work
    in Haiti. \r\n \r\nThe SoTA board is overjoyed by the response to this project.
    We hope many of you will join us at our annual conference being held this year
    in Los Angeles, California at the end of August (www.typecon.com). We also encourage
    you to become a member of SoTA to help support projects such as Font Aid (http://www.typesociety.org/memjoin.html)

    study, and support of type, its history and development, its use in the world

    they are in this gif, but they are quite ornate and completely chaotic and organic.\r\n\r\neverybody
    did such a good job with this project. so proud I was able to get so many glyphs
    in there and keep the final OTF file size under 300K. fontlab and opentype work
    like magic sometimes.\r\n\r\n-chank"

    put together\u2026 and wondering whose ampersand I get when I type & (shift+7),
