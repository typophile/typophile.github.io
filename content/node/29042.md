body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI left my job about six months ago and started freelancing.
  I've now decided it's time to take things a bit more seriously and design a business
  card for myself.\r\n\r\nSo far I've got four options, they're not too different
  from one another but I'd like to get some feedback on the layouts.\r\n\r\nI've left
  them B&W for the moment until I reach a decision on what colour(s) I'm after. I
  plan on getting them printed on a matt stock using an offset printer.\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\n"

    like so."

  body: "I think A is good - your details and logo are on the same side, which would
    be better if your card ends up in one of those business card files that some people
    use... if you go with option D, I think the side with the logo should carry your
    web address also.\r\n\r\nAs Gavin P says - the d needs capitalising in 'Art Director'.\r\n\r\nAs
    the design is minimal, it might be an option to use a strong colour to complement
    it - maybe a metallic."

    (green 556U), and all the text was in white. It had a lot of positive feedback,
    especially the colour.\r\nIn the new version the green is on the reverse side,
    for a change."

    Now I'm stuck between option A or D for the win. I'm kind of leaning towards D,
    but I'll see how they look once I've mocked them up.\r\n\r\nSatya, they are going
    to be offset printed.\r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bezarama.net\">A

    card isn't going to be easily printed offset unless you plan on going with a black

  body: "If art director / designer is a description of what you do vs. a formal title,
    it should absolutely not be capitalized.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find this sort of
    indiscriminate capitalization a huge problem, especially in advertising. Why are
    graphic designers not required to take basic courses in grammar, structure and
    spelling? The people responsible for the text we read should also have training
    that is a bit broader than aesthetics and tool-use.\r\n\r\nCertainly, I have never
    asked if there was \"a Doctor in the house,\" but I would address my friend James
    as Doctor Liau. Capitalize a title or honorific, sure ... but not a description;
    that doesn't make any sense at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com

      probably would haved worded it Art direction/design.\r\n\r\nOn another note,
      most Art Directors work with Copywriters and generally they take care of all
      the grammar, structure and spelling.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bezarama.net\">A
