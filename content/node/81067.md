  \r\n\r\nInspired by the Gralab logo from the 70's, I am trying to create an aesthetic
  that can make my logo memorable, fun and classic.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly happy with the
  logo at this stage, but I'm not sure the uppercase 'G' is really working and would
  love an opinion /advice on any of the other letters. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nNick"

  body: This is looking good, but I might recommend a crossbar on the G, so it doesn't
    look like Crafik.

  body: Looking awesome!  Maybe a horizontal cross on the lower part of the G would
    make it less ambiguous.  The only other thing I would look at is the inconsistent
    treatment of rounded vs brush lines.  Nice start!

  body: "Hi Frode,\r\n\r\nYip aware of that, Grafik magazine is a recent re-brand
    of 'Graphics International' and they dont offer digital design services. If I
    was using 'grafik magazine' as my brand then I would have reason to worry =) Well
    I think thats how it works anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick"

    of the \xA9 or have fun with it by creating a lowercase <em>i</em> or an exclamation
    point.\r\n\r\nThe apex of the <em>A</em> looks thicker than everything else to
    me."

    the a and f a bit. Keep the overlap but not making them 'one'.\r\n\r\nHanddraw
    a \xA9 in same style would look a lot more professional to me.\r\n\r\nFun logo!"

  body: I still get caught up on the inconsistent terminals - R & F have brush stroke
    terminals and the rest have rounded terminals.  But it really is nice!

  body: "Looks great! I dont think I mind the inconsistent terminals. It's a bit awkward
    but in a good way. It ads to the uniqueness. Just like the GRA FIK composition.\r\n\r\nYou
    tell us when your website goes live?"
