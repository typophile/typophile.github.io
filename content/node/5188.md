body: 'I&#39;m trying to identify this font. I know it&#39;s not Times New Roman,
  Garamond, MinionPro. They are close but there are subtle differences. This logo
  was created back in 1987, which may be why I&#39;m having so much trouble identifying
  the font.  <BR> <BR>Please help. <BR> <BR>Can be viewed here :  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.bluespot.net/clients/logo/ncilogo.jpg"
