  body: "The large display type on the bottom is Adobe Garamond Italic with italic
    alternates (the unusual Q in Quando).\r\n\r\nMaggio and the year could be Helvetica,
    but the sample is so small I can't say for sure."

  body: I stand corrected. Save for the more ornate alternate Q, it's difficult to
    distinguish between the two...at least before I've had breakfast.
