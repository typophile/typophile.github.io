body: 'Hi folks... greenhorn here with a question &#40;yes, I already did many a search
  before posting&#41;: <BR> <BR>I work for a car dealership doing design- now, some
  manufacturers are more than willing to give me their typeface &#40;BMW and MINI
  demand it&#41;... but other companies, such as Toyota, do not provide any aid to
  me whatsoever.  I was wondering if Toyota happened to be a pre-existing font, or
  if they created it themselves.  I&#39;ll try to attach an image here of my best
  attempt to mimic it &#40;ironically, what I found to work best in my library is
  MINI&#39;s corporate font shrunk to 90%&#41;... to me the most glaring difference
  between Toyota&#39;s and any other font out there are the O&#39;s which are basically
  perfect circles- in fact it almost appears as if all of the Toyota characters are
  basically geometric symbols of any sans serif font.  Ok so at any rate, does anyone
  know this font, or where I might get it?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49350.gif"

  body: I got a pretty close match from <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/testdriver/gotham_bold.html"
    target="_blank">Gotham Bold</a> from Hoefler. It&#39;s hard, though, with only
    these few characters. It does have the round O.

  body: It figures that I didn&#39;t think of Avenir - I&#39;m using it for a job
    right now. You never see what&#39;s right in front of your face.

  body: Well, I finally got an email back from corporate... they told me there is
    no &#34;official&#34; font, and they directed me to an area of the dealer interface
    website where they have some logos.  I don&#39;t believe that these people are
    passing some vector image back and forth whenever they do Toyota design... there
    must be a set of characters somewhere.    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the font suggestions...
    those are both pretty damn close... I think i&#39;d give the edge to Gotham Bold...
    now if I can just get the brass to order it for me... <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    the help folks
