  looking to update my font collection. If you were to reccomend 10 fonts that you
  feel are essential to your craft, what would they be. Thanks. : &#41;'

  body: I disagree with the philosophy that one should have a stable of fonts, ready
    to use on whatever job comes along. <BR> <BR>As an art director, I was always
    looking for the new font for the new job. As a type designer, the one&#40;s&#41;
    I&#39;m working on at the moment are always the most essential.  <BR> <BR>And
    bear in mind, the right font for the job in hand may not have been designed yet,
    and may require commissioning.

  body: Please bear with me while I make an analogy. <BR> <BR>When my wife&#39;s brother
    got married and bought a house, he and  <BR>his wife purchased all of their furniture
    and decorations in one  <BR>sitting, so they could have their new house entirely
    furnished by  <BR>the time they moved in. <BR> <BR>Their interior looks like a
    cacophony. <BR> <BR>My wife and I on the other hand started out with leftover  stuff  <BR>from
    family and friends, and gradually acquired new items.  <BR>Every time we&#39;d
    bought something, we waited till we got used  <BR>to it and evaluated how it interacted
    with the house and the  <BR>other objects in the room before buying the next item.
    <BR> <BR>Decorating a house is not unlike building a type library.

  body: There are no &#34;10 essential fonts&#34;, just like there are no 10 essential  <BR>furniture
    items. Every time you find there&#39;s a typeface missing in your  <BR>library
    for a specific job, select a new one that will both do for that  <BR>job and make
    sure it stylistically fills a gap in your collection, so odds  <BR>are you&#39;ll
    be able to get some mileage out of it. <BR> <BR>Instead of going for Garamond,
    Caslon, Perpetua, Gill Sans, DIN, Helvetica  <BR>and so on try FTF Rongel, Enigma,
    Delicato, Parisine, Klavika, Galaxy Polaris...  <BR>There&#39;s so many brilliant
    contemporary designs which are tomorrow&#39;s classics.
