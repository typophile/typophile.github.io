  then last night I get an email saying could I try the following (specifically with
  these colours)....\r\n\r\n\r\nI ring them and ask them why the change in colour
  and apparently its because they looked at someone else's site and those were the
  colours they used.....they wanted fresh and modern and to me what they want looks
  terrible in these colours (conservative grey, too many competing elements in the
  logo with the colours)\r\n\r\nI'm meeting with them in a few hours- and as I always
  say it's their logo at the end of the day...but can anyone else see where I am coming
  from??\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANNARQ_5880.jpg]"

    what color do you use when you have to print the logo on white?"

    ROFL.\r\nThere's a black and white version...part of the problem is there are
    two people in the team and one of them would of just gone with first option...but
    the other is interior designer and keeps tweaking things..I think it looks bankish
    or a football team...\r\n\r\nAnyway wish me luck..\r\n\r\nM."

    though one of my favourite colour combinations I have had the problem of the yellow
    disappearing into the grey when just squinting a little - unfortunately it was
    the date of the event and I wasn't asked to do flyers for that club again!\r\n\r\nI
    like the softness of the type. The tail of the g however is getting a bit close
    to its own bowl!\r\n\r\nHope you can think of other was to push this along...\r\n"

    it looks awful at all. I have more problems with the loop of the g and width of
    the i than with the colors. You might be valuing your own taste too much. '

  body: "\r\nHello, Maree.\r\n\r\nYes, they are insane. Sorry I'm late.\r\n\r\nIt's
    really hard to talk about design with a client, when they ask why you are using
    this colour and not the other, what's the difference between Helvetica and Comic
    Sans...\r\n\r\nWe must be prepared for this kind of questions. My way of telling
    a client that his logo is \"crap\" is by telling them that it is \"non- functional\"
    and asking them what they want to communicate, what values do they have as a business.
    \r\n\r\nThey might answer:\r\n\"We are a fresh and modern company that provides
    design solutions to bla bla bla...\" \r\n\r\nNow you have to take a big breath
    and start telling them why their propousal isn't communicating what they are as
    a business.\r\n\r\nYou can start saying something like:\r\n\"Yellow is a warm
    colour, in your propusal is losing power, it looks like worn out. The contrast
    with light grey isn't helping at all, it isn't a fresh colour.  Beside, you are
    adding more colours to the logo, making it more difficult to recognize. If you
    go for one colour it is more recognizable, it's easier to be positionated in the
    mind of the client.\"\r\n\r\nYou may also do some research of all the competition
    logos that have the same colours, shapes, etc. You must convince them that the
    most important thing in a company is to be different from the competition.\r\n\r\nThat's
    another very important point, competition.\r\n\r\nI'd love to keep writing about
    this subject, I really like talking to clients, it's a trhilling moment that defines
    you... But my english is quite rusty and I'm afraid I'm not making too much sense.\r\n\r\nI
    recommend you this blog:\r\nhttp://justcreativedesign.com/featured-articles/\r\n\r\nAnd
    this special article:\r\nhttp://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/27/what-makes-a-good-logo/\r\n\r\nLet
    me know how it was.\r\n\r\n\xB7Panda\xB7"
