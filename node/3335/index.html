<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Doggy Overnight Bag is to be a small kit that's placed in hotel rooms that are pet friendly. It will contains things such as a dog blanket, food & water dishes, dog treats and other such stuff. <br> <br>They were presented with three different concepts and this is what they're going with. I have some tweaks in mind, but overall I'm pretty pleased with it. I would like help seeing the things I shouldn't be pleased with. I'm sure they're there.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the mark and the type on the second version but the letter spacing needs work. I think you need to take some space between the o and first g out in doggy and please don't crash the y into the g. In Overnight the t is floating and you can crash the ni combination a bit more. In Bag make the B a combination tighter. <br>Question: could you have come up with a harder to space font? I remember this font from the 70s and it never set well. If you have time take a look at ITC Caslon 224 Extra Bold, it has character and the color of the letter spacing is much better and it has some of the feel you have here. <br>Did you do a verion of the mark with a black lab and a outline moon? I haven't seen a black moon lately.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Daniel, don't you think that Caslon is lacking the warmth and friendliness of this one (for the life of me I can't remember it's name)? <br> <br>Don't you think the first is stronger? The blackness of the moon and the type in the first creates a nice contrast for the puppy.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you much for the feedback. <br> <br>Daniel, (I forgot to mention) you'll have to excuse my spacing on this for now. I've yet to purchase that font, so it's as spaced by myfonts.com. I do expect some difficulty in spacing it well, though. <br> <br>I haven't yet tried the outline moon with a black dog, but I'm trying it real soon like. Does anyone feel the black moon is a serious issue? I'd like to know. <br> <br>Windsor is the name, Tiffany. I felt it was quite warm and even sleepy(?) <br> <br>Thanks again</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the dog needs to be much bigger than it is (in relation to the crescent). <br> <br>Be careful of choosing a font based on its name! That said, I think this choice is pretty good - if you could only make the "g"s less cramped in the light version. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>lc. 'g" reminds me of a lazy dog. Perhaps a bit reworking on the "g" would harmonized the design. Maybe tail shoul be wagin' a bit like a dog ( as much as hate "cuteness" this might work). I do not care for currrent lc"n" especially next to the lc"i". straigthen it up a bit on the right side. Illustration is very nice and perfect for intended use. </div>

<div class=commentbody>>Be careful of choosing a font based on its name! <br>Huh? I'm guessing there is a correlation, but it's not obvious to me. Do tell. <br> <br>Hrant, for what reason does the size of the dog concern you? The illustration goes quite small with the dog still being discernable. I don't think he could sleep comfortably on that moon if he was very much bigger. I will try him as big as I can though (the client also wanted to see this) <br> <br>Ole, waggy-tailed g's? I don't believe I would know how to pull that off. What are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/brighton/bold/testdrive.html?s=Doggy&p=60"> these g's</a> doing? I was looking at that font(Brighton), but I don't think so. <br> <br>I like the sloped sides in Windsor but, maybe I'll have to reign them in some. <br> <br>Is there any reason why the stroke contrast differs between letters in this face. Compare the the capital and lowercase o's. <br> <br>Thanks again for your comments everybody.</div>

<div class=commentbody>C'mon Ole, why do you gotta go and suggest such lovely types and get me all confused. ;) Okay, I agree that Sauna is great. (I've always wanted it myself, hasn't everyone) But it's probably out of range for this project. I do agree that it's a good value. I'll see. <br> <br>quick question: I've had the inkling that an Italic would be less appropriate for this, as they are less "at rest". What do you all think? <br> <br>>There is not any weight that would be perfect <br>I'd love to know you're thoughts (or see an example) of a perfect weight for this. <br> <br>Johnathan, that's interesting, but I'm guessing I don't have to worry about that too much. That's a cool flag, though. <br> <br>Thanks everybody</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mitchell - The dog on the moon is very very good. <br>Going against the grain, I'd suggest maybe <br>looking into something a bit more playful for <br>the type. <br> <br>Here are a few more suggestions (couldn't clean link these for some reason.) <br> <br>Softie <br><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tailspinstudio/softie/regular/testdrive.html?s=Doggie%2BOvernight%2BBag&p=48" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tailspinstudio/softie/regular/testdrive.html?s=Doggie+Overnight+Bag&p=48</a> <br> <br>Beachbuoy <br><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/joevanderbos/beachbuoy/medium/testdrive.html?s=Doggie%2BOvernight%2BBag&p=48" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/joevanderbos/beachbuoy/medium/testdrive.html?s=Doggie+Overnight+Bag&p=48</a> <br> <br>Retrofit <br><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/joevanderbos/retrofit/light/testdrive.html?s=Doggie%2BOvernight%2BBag&p=48" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/joevanderbos/retrofit/light/testdrive.html?s=Doggie+Overnight+Bag&p=48</a> <br> <br>Tarnation <br><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sparkytype/tarnation/tarnation/testdrive.html?s=Doggie%2BOvernight%2BBag&p=48" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sparkytype/tarnation/tarnation/testdrive.html?s=Doggie+Overnight+Bag&p=48</a> <br> <br>Whichever direction you choose, try setting the word <br>in different cases and look for ways that you <br>can customize the type. <br> <br>* You have four lowercase 'gs' in play. <br>* Look at how the letters fit together and play off each other. <br>* consider the counters. <br>* consider alternate letterforms not "in the font". <br> <br>good luck! <br> <br>bj <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure the moon's outline is a bit mis-shapen. Perhaps too many pen points are getting in the way of a smooth vector circlish shape? <br> <br>Also, I really like PJ's Retrofit suggestion, though it might be better if it were slightly rounded.</div>
