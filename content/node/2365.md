  <BR>I&#39;ve heard about this book, but confess I&#39;ve never seen a copy in person.
  How useful/valuable is it? Is really out of print, like Amazon suggests. <BR> <BR>Is
  the 1980 reprint as good / better than the 1937 original? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22180.jpg"

    status, but these days people have been pointing out weaknesses &#40;which it
    does have&#41;. On the other hand, those -the few- who really bag on it have got
    it all backwards. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s really a goldmine of type knowledge, and brings
    together many historic specimens, with usually expert analysis from an actual
    user of type - and a proficient one. However it&#39;s also a very personal book
    - not a &#34;scholarly&#34; one deep down. Like when Updike makes Dutch type sound
    like trash and Spanish type like the best thing since sliced bread. But if you
    take his particular opinions in stride and realize it has some historical gaps,
    then it&#39;s really uniquely useful - there&#39;s nothing like it. However, it&#39;s
    also a specialist&#39;s book. It&#39;s all about type, not much more. You really
    have to love type to enjoy it. <BR> <BR>BTW, there have been three &#34;historic&#34;
    editions: 1922, 1937, 1967. The first one is supposed to have the best reproduction,
    the second one has new material, the third neither - which is I guess how I managed
    to buy a copy of that one &#40;both volumes&#41; for only $75. The Dover &#40;?&#41;
    reprints are not considered very good, but the textual content of course is there
    &#40;as opposed to the fidelity of the specimens&#41;, and that&#39;s most of
    its value as far as I&#39;m concerned. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    anything to write home about. You don&#39;t often see superb reproduction in book
    materials from that era, mainly because of the paper that was used. And the out-of-print
    Dover, by the way, is much superior to the Oak Knoll reprint in quality of reproduction.
    Someone just had the Dover up on eBay, think they were asking $25 for the two
    volumes.

  body: John <BR> <BR>Yes, there is no dot pattern with collotype but there is reticulation
    &#40;zero to infinity on the grayscale&#41; and often extreme exposure variation.
    I do know this as my partner and I spent six months researching how to do collotype
    and another six trying to do it. After all that time we actually got 146 pretty
    damn good copies &#40;!!!&#41; printing on an Albion iron handpress  <BR> <BR>But,
    that was just the results of a couple of enthusiastic learners. I&#39;m quite
    sure, that as you say, the Oxford collotypes were quite on the mark. That was
    somewhat the peak of commercial collotype production.  <BR> <BR>Shortly afterward,
    the process began to disappear from the commercial scene. I have a very intriguing
    French literary magazine, published immediately after WWII, that has wonderful
    photos of the French Resistance Printers. And they were all in collotype, very,
    very rich in tonal quality. In the postwar years the process fell into the domain
    of fine printmakers. Very few folks are masters of it today. <BR> <BR>Gerald

    heritage, and followed in DeVinne&#39;s path in this regard. Like DeVinne, because
    he was a printer, he brought a prospective to printing history that was refreshing
    clear compared with previous scholarly efforts.  <BR> <BR>This book is actually
    the first encompassing look at the history of type design and development. It
    is quite important despite any views we might choose to project from our contemporary
    perspective. <BR> <BR>Updike had prejudices. He denigrated blackletter, had little
    use for the travesties of the nineteenth-century... He was a revivalist and sought
    to understand and explain that lineage, in doing so he discarded what would not
    fit.  <BR> <BR>He was no elitist &#40;not in the way you choose to see him at
    least&#41;, just a proud working stiff, with, actually, very little use for work
    outside the commercial sphere. For instance, he had little respect for the private
    presses of his time period, oddly, as they contributed significantly to changes
    in the industry that Updike himself championed. <BR> <BR>The typographic revival
    was not started by Updike, he was simply one of those who had a hand in legitimizing  it.

    By the way there is a great East Indian restaurant in Toronto. I think a lot of
    great typograhy got rolled out in the twenties. Talking to you makes me hungry.
    I  will look for the business card of the restaurant. There is never any cheap
    flights to Canada. Updike printed a really lovely corporate book for a wicker
    funiture manufacturer. I actually read the book, it was interesting. He got pretty
    wealthy with his shop. Both Updike and John Henry Nash. <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald,
    <BR> <BR>Middleton was one great guy. Well in any event I am envious you had the

    by the young turks in the printmaking department. During a round table meeting,
    as a form of rationale Middleton began discussing the wonderment of some stone
    cutting he had seen on one of the buildings outside. Two turks turned to each
    other in bewildered astonishment and one of them said, &#34;he&#39;s talking about
    _letters_ again&#34;! This took place, of course, at a time before type was cool.
    Despite their noble or ignoble efforts, the program was established.

  body: 'Gerald, thank you for pointing out Updike&#39;s position as an innovative
    historian. <BR> <BR>When you say he was a working printer, do you mean that he
    actually got his fingers dirty? <BR> <BR>You are right, a little historical relativism
    is called for: what we would today call snobbery was, in the context of the class
    system of his time, merely &#34;pride&#34;. <BR> <BR>But by the same token, you
    shouldn&#39;t describe Updike as a &#34;working stiff&#34;, with today&#39;s connotations
    of exploited labourer. <BR>Updike&#39;s prejudices were those of his time. Book
    printers &#40;such as he?&#41; looked down their noses at jobbing printers who
    did commercial &#40;ie advertising&#41; work, did they not? So, in that sense,
    it is incorrect to describe him as a commercial printer.  <BR> <BR>Wasn&#39;t
    there a &#34;class&#34; system, with private presses at the top, the Updikes and
    De Vinnes in the middle, and jobbing printers at the bottom? <BR> <BR>To revise
    my point: the idea we have now of the importance of popular culture didn&#39;t
    emerge until the 1960s. So Updike, in writing a serious history of his discipline,
    ignored popular &#40;commercial&#41; culture. <BR> <BR>&#40;Mind you, things haven&#39;t
    really changed, it&#39;s still only a small &#34;arty&#34; part of the graphics
    industry that gets the trade press coverage and the critical analysis in books.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>All the marvellous typographic inventions and virtuosity &#40;you consider
    these &#34;travesties&#34;?&#41; of the mainstream 19th century, Updike regarded
    as degradation. So, there are no showings in his book of fat faces, Clarendons,
    Sans Serifs, etc. <BR> <BR>The founder&#39;s specimen books of the 19th century
    give a far broader idea of what was happening than Updike&#39;s narrowly focused
    exposition. <BR> <BR>So, Updike: big ommissions, if you&#39;re expecting a broad
    coverage of type history. But at the time, innovative, and substantial in those
    areas he did cover. And very relevant to the graphic historicism of the early
    20th century. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Nick <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t consider the typographic explosion that occurred
    in the nineteenth century a travesity, but certainly those who had hopes to revitalize
    and improve typography in the early twentieth century did. Even good ole bad boy
    Marinetti hated the typography of the nineteenth century. At the time, I suspect
    most folks in the industry were quite pleased to get beyond it, or there simply
    would not have been the intense interest in the revival and, as well, in the modernist
    approach. <BR> <BR>There is unfortunately no study yet compiled that provides
    a good prospective on nineteenth century printing and typographic innovations
    and developments. Certainly, the great strides that occurred in the twentieth
    all were put into place the century before. I&#39;m much more interested in the
    nineteenth century than I am the twentieth, but NOT a nineteenth century based
    on twenty-first century cliches. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m certain you are right that Updike
    considered many nineteenth century faces as degradation, even ahistorical, but
    he was hardly alone at the time. But yes, he was a working printer, in the guts
    of it, not just books. I have a nice little book of his called, I think, A Day
    in the Work, something like that. Pretty much the routine of the printshop. <BR>
    <BR>Don&#39;t know that one could strategize the various kinds of work of that
    time into anything like a &#34;class&#34; system. Many of the typographic high-rollers
    in the commercial realm, Gill, Goudy, etc., were also involved with the Private
    Press Movement. I doubt the output of the private press was considered high class
    as much as it may have been considered archaic, and perhaps of interest because
    of that, since therein lay the roots of the revival. But the mixing only occurred
    because of the players involved, who straddled many fences. <BR> <BR>Popular culture
    is derived pretty much from the sloganisms of any period isn&#39;t it? As much
    as it can be defined at that time, I assume through advertising, etc, yes, Updike
    would certainly have been part of it. I assume you are talking typographically.
    If anything, he wasn&#39;t purposely ignoring it, but unaware of it since as you
    point out, it wasn&#39;t a defined concept. But, as far as the commercial printing
    industry&#39;s influence on distributing the slogans of commerce, yeah, certainly
    Updike was instrumental in evolving that.

  body: Nick <BR> <BR>Typographically speaking, I think the auteur theory has been
    around for some time, if not defined as such. Wouldn&#39;t William Morris be the
    auteur of the Kelmscott Press output even though he had little workaday involvement
    in the actual production? I&#39;m sure one could find all kinds of examples that
    go way, way back. &#40;???&#41; <BR> <BR>I think Updike&#39;s history was actually
    a map for the future. He probably thought what he considered deadends were not
    worth inclusion. He dismissed letterforms that had no defining historical lineage
    or linkage. I think that&#39;s pretty much it. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know that
    one can make the case that there was some kind of opposition or counter-action
    going on at the time. I&#39;m wondering if you think there might have been? Diehard
    nineteenth centuryists or something like that. I kind of doubt it. The future
    was a big deal. Even the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement was an attempt at salvation
    rather than a looking backward. The attendant typefaces of the Industrial Revolution
    that evolved out of nowhere for the sole purpose of selling the commodities that
    came out of industrialization were considered dehumanizing, no matter how funky
    or attractive they may seem today. Without previous investigations to lead the
    way, I suspect neither Updike or anyone else at the time could really make head
    or tail out of the nineteenth century&#39;s typographic cornucopia and so it was
    pretty much sidestepped.

  body: Gerald,  <BR> <BR>Updike was not alone in being unable to &#34;see&#34; the
    19th century. To this day, the standard conception of modernity is that there
    were political and industrial revolutions c.1800, but that modern art didn&#39;t
    ramp up till impressionism, and take off till the 1900s, a century later. This
    viewpoint has been challenged recently by post-structuralists &#40;eg &#34;Techniques
    of the Observer, by Jonathan Crary&#41; but there is still a huge amount of work
    to be done unearthing the modernity of the 19th century. Of course, type designers
    were right there early on, with the unicase bold sans serif! <BR> <BR>As a counterforce
    to Revivalism, I would say that Cheltenham bridged the gap between 19th and 20th
    century modernism. It had a big, systematic family, printed well on coated and
    uncoated, in text and display, hot and cold. It&#39;s definitely not a Didone
    Modern, but in true Victorian fashion combined pseudo-historical forms with precisely
    engineered serifs. It was massive exactly concurrent with revivalism, until the
    1930s. The Century typeface can also be seen as an evolution of the 19th Century
    modern. I have a 1921 edition of De Vinne&#39;s &#34;Correct Composition&#34;,
    still set in -- De Vinne. <BR> <BR>For editorial text type, revivalism never supplanted
    the &#34;numbered romans&#34; &#40;Victorian didone&#41; in mass market magazines,
    books and newspapers. Even the Linotype &#34;Old Style&#34; is pretty much a Century
    &#40;except for its italic&#41;.

  body: Nick <BR> <BR>This is good stuff. There were a lot of train wrecks with the
    turn of the century. Or perhaps the problem has been to make distinctions between
    the centuries. Its very difficult to sort out the Northern European transistions
    for instance. To have clean cut ideologies like Revivalism and Modernity unfortunately
    serves to both clear and cloud the vision. Thanks for doing the work. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: Some considerable comment could be made about general quality of printed products
    during the nineteenth century. <BR> <BR>Washboard type heights, multitudes of
    point standards unsuccessfully mixed into a singular type forme. Some reflection
    is more than deserved pondering master/slave working conditions non-conducive
    to fine typography. The results are generally best appreciated if you consider
    yourself viewing a typographical freak show. <BR> <BR>Not to mention such things
    as cylinder presses that were built for one thing in mind, production. Quantity
    had clearly surplanted quality. The same could be applied to the inventions of
    both the Linotype, and Monotype machines. The mother of their inventions was <i>Mrs.
    Get The Lead Out.</i> <BR> <BR>Later, Monotypes machines were tinkered with by
    the <i>why can&#39;t you crowd</i> such as the great Bruce Rogers. Cylinder presses
    were adapted for fine printing by John Henry Nash  and Fount le Roy. The latter
    pioneered fine press work aboard semi automatic cylinder presses. A very novel
    idea at that time. I remember in my days this had been reversed and I was told
    that cylinder presses were superior to platens for fine printing. Both opinions
    are non sense if applied generally. Compare the problems of rule work on a cylinder
    press, vs. rule work on a platen press. Simplified, the purchase of a press was
    not a mechanical decision, it was a marketing decision. <BR> <BR>Also the nineteen
    century was plagued by insidious optometry experiments regarding spacing techniques
    causing our great grand daddies to either become blind, or wishing they were blind.
    Pages with mutton spaces  after a periods. &#40;A frightful eyesore that lingered
    on even into my own day.&#41; <BR> <BR>This period of typography I hope does not
    inspire typographical nostalgia. Rightful it would be banned along with the past
    Chinese custom of binding young woman

  body: Gerald&#39;s comments are exactly why the nineteenth century was such a mess
    typographically. The concern for preserving type design &#40;or wishing there
    had been more concern&#41; that we may share today has nothing to do with the
    reality of the type industry at that time. The turn of the century brought with
    it a massive change in technologies and standards. No one wanted to look back.
    <BR> <BR>Today there is growing nostalgia for the faces of photofilm but the reality
    of that technology was that it was a bloody degradation of quality. Welcomed when
    it superseded metal, but its demise was cheered as well.

  body: Gerald G, <BR> <BR>If you were a myopic snob like Updike, you would now write
    a history of types that ended with the eclipse of metal, ignoring that which is
    immediately in front of you, phototype and digital type. Not to mention dry transfer
    type. <BR> <BR>But from any meaningful historical perspective, surely the work
    that is most expressive of an era is done when designers come to grips with the
    new technology of that era. &#40;Although, as you say, this takes no account of
    the social consequences.&#41; <BR> <BR>For instance, the ability of the phototypositor,
    and Letraset, to set type extremely tightly, overlapping and negative leaded even,
    produced a style of setting, starting in the early 60s, that later informed a
    generation of type designers such as Lubalin and Benguiat. Whatever one thinks
    of the quality of photofilm, At the time, it ruled.  <BR> <BR>Working with filmset
    ITC faces as an art director in the 70s and 80s, I always felt as if there was
    a wall between me and the ancient noble essence of typography that I sought to
    somehow incorporate in my work, yet at the same time, I have to say that the way
    the typesetting industry was set up put a lot of typographically skilled, knowledgable
    people into the production process workflow, and accorded a huge importance to
    typography -- just look at its prominence in the print ads of the era, in the
    awards annuals. <BR> <BR>And although Ed Benguiat thought Herb Lubalin was the
    only one who ever used Avant Garde&#39;s alternates with any taste, those alternates
    made typography a lof of fun for---the working stiff.
