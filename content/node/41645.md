body: "hi \r\n\r\ni will be vacuum forming type shortly for a mould.\r\n\r\ncurrently
  using helvetica (i know) ultra compressed at 320pt with +10 spacing.\r\ngoing for
  the hersheys logo feel.\r\n\r\nthe issue im having is that the S and G have too
  much happening and im a bit worried that the vacuum process will not pick up as
  much detail as id like.\r\n\r\nany ideas? maybe alternative typefaces?\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough
  glyph modification could be an answer im not too versed in that area\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregards\r\n"

    it more condensed than that? \r\nscroll down to see it here:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html\r\n\r\nYou
    could use 59 (ultra condensed), but at that narrow width, there's not enough room
    for a bold weight.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Hi there...\r\n\r\nI have done something similar, and just wants to give
    you a little word of advise.\r\nSince there is a limit to how much the plastic
    can stretch before it cracks, you might want to consider the sizes of the counters,
    which is where the cracking will happen first.\r\nHowever your size is slightly
    bigger than in my example(280PTS), but being condensed also  decreses counter
    size. Anyway just give it a go, it is a very interresting process. :-)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC00046_3790.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC00047_3760.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC00087_3505.jpg]"
