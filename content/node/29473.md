  types of font, any one would be fine, though I would personally prefer the \"PHOSPHOR.\"
  font.\r\n\r\nThese fonts in the picture are hand-drawn, so no 100% match is possible
  (tried the What The Font website, no luck), but I'm sure very similar fonts must
  exist.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bottles-s_3434.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? (Preferably free fonts)\r\n\r\nBest regards & TIA,\r\nTillmann\r\n"

  body: "Hi Tillmann\r\n\r\n(Question) If you want them for free, and you know they
    are hand drawn to begin with, what is stopping you from redrawing them yourself?\r\n\r\nThe
    Sol.Zinc.Sulfur lettering is a fat face \u2013 something like <a h/ref=\"http://www.linotype.com/1363/posterbodoni-family.html\">Poster
    \ Bodoni Compressed</a>\r\n\r\nThe Phosphor.Sol lettering is some kind of mangled
    sans serif (of which there are many available as freebies on the web), but I don't
    know what it might be called. Probably someone else here knows what it is..."

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n@ ben_archer:\r\n\r\nThanks, Poster Bodoni Compressed
      matches quite well - knowing that, I also found the cheaper alternative \"Arsis\"
      where the uppercase characters seem to look pretty much identical (the lowercase
      ones don't).\r\nWhy I am not redrawing it myself? Well, I'm an engineer not
      a graphics artist, I neither have the tools nor the skills to do it :)\r\n\r\n@skyfein:\r\n\r\nThanks
      also, I checked out these fonts but they don't really match. If you look at
      the S on the bottle - the outside of the letter is squarish, but the inside
      of the S is perfectly round, and the thickness varies across the letter. Haven't
      found a font with these characteristics. I think that's what gives the \"handmade\"
      feel. \r\n\r\nbye,\r\nTillmann\r\n"

    feel you're after, and a few of them are free. I'm thinking of Alternative Three,
    C.I.A., Ginger Mint (the lowercase is stupendous), Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and Traktor.\r\n\r\nI'm
    a sign painter and a huge fan of naive typography. Hence, my enthusiasm! =) \r\n\r\nSkylar"
