    you, it&#39;s just  <BR>that we don&#39;t have a clue. I already looked for it
    twice,  <BR>but nothing yet. I&#39;m really sorry mate. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Gia&#39;s a fair enough guess: it&#39;s very
    similar in concept, <BR>though there&#39;s a couple of mismatches in some characters.'

    thanx! Welcome to the Typophile regulars  <BR>&#40;check your status at your 101th
    post&#41;. <BR> <BR>Really, the person to thank would be my co-moderator  <BR>Stephen,
    who -by example- inspires me to be a nicer,  <BR>gentler and helpful online person.
    He&#39;s the original,  <BR>I&#39;m just following his lead. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really touched. After receiving last
    Thursday what might  <BR>be the most beautiful present <i>ever</i> and an incredibly
    sweet  <BR>Christmas card from another Typophile, this is the second  <BR>time
    I&#39;ve been touched by pure kindness from this board.  <BR>I fully agree this
    joint is the best to be part of, damn straight! <BR>Thanks Joseph&#39;n&#39;Jared!
