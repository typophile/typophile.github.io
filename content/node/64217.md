  body: "We have had this question before, and the answer was that \"Captain Morgan\"
    is custom lettering, as most logos are. If that's not the lettering you are interested
    in, you should show us a picture of it.\r\n\r\nFor pirate-themed fonts, just search
    at MyFonts.com with the term \"Pirate\" and you will get a number of suggestions.\r\n\r\n-
