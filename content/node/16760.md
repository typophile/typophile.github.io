body: "I have to create a signage system for a school of engineering and would need
  some font recommendations.\r\nThe architectural style of the university is somewhere
  between Art Deco, Functionalism and Modernism. (with an emphasis on functionalism
  and modernism) I don't want to use the \"classics\" like Frutiger and co., I would
  be more interested in a sans with a more technical look (but still legible).\r\n\r\nTill
  now, I found Foundry Monoline and Gridnik somehow suitable.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  any recommendation  of modern sans serifs with \"not so\" humanistic influences...\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Michi"

  body: "Other excellent squarish sans you might compare are mentioned in <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000944.php\">this
    note</a> by Yves Peters.\r\n\r\nI would also look at a face specifically for way
    finding, such as <a href=\"http://vllg.com/TypeInitiative/Arrival/Example+About/\">Arrival</a>\r\n\r\nIf
    it were me I would also look at decorative stuff reminiscent of the twenties,
    if that is when your buildings were built--such as the gorgeous Minha from FontBureau.
    (There is something weird with their site at the moment.)\r\n\r\nAlso my current
    favorite is Chris Lozos' <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16147\">NOW</a> Maybe
    you could get him to do a medium weight for signage!  "

    you will have a lot of technical (and lengthy) words, a narrower face will give
    you more flexibility. Here are some options, I don't have a preference for Font

    it wasn't mentioned).\r\nAlign is a beautiful typeface but I think it has too
    much \"character\" for this signage.\r\n\r\nMeta/Unit are a little bit too humanistic
    but I can imagine FF Info on these signs.\r\n\r\nI think Klavika and FF Info are
    on top of my list so far.."

    weight of Sabon we've got on signs here.
