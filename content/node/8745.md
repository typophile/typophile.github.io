  body: Do you mean the font Apple uses for web and print media? That&#39;s indeed
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/myriad/headline/testdrive.html?s=iPod+Music+Extras&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Myriad</a>. But if you mean the font that the iPod uses on its
    display, that would be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/chicago/chicago/testdrive.html?s=iPod+Music+Extras&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Chicago</a>.
