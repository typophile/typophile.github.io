<p>But I’m trying to get away from relating everything in my fonts. I’m starting to feel that hyper-anal normalization of type across fonts and families gets really boring after a while. This style can really suck the life out of a project as consistency overwhelms personality. I’ve had a couple projects die when normalization took over and blandness set in, and I’m tired of running into that wall.</p>

<p>As a calligrapher one of my canons is if the interior of an o is off it distracts the eye&hellip; extrapolate from there, at least for me, I keep consistent the interior shapes and vary, within reason, the exterior shapes. Of course you cannot  go &ldquo;letters gone wild,&rdquo; well you could with a bizarre font.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Maybe I have been living under the delusion that &ldquo;calligraphy is about fancy and flight whereas type is about continuity&rdquo; too long : )</p>

(In my textured fonts I always keep the interior shapes clean for this very reason.) In lettering my eye stops dead in its tracks on interior shapes that are not quite right. So, to me, would inconsistencies in the continuity of interiors in type cause a double take, interrupting the flow.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think letters like the O, o, H and h is the key to every other glyphs design when speaking of pen angle, consistency and such. The other thing is how terminals are ending, what angle? The same angle, or does it follow the curve in a logical way? Or not? As long as it is consistent I think it&rsquo;s a well designed typeface :) 
As James are saying, the s and the e should harmonize more, now they come from two different kind of &lsquo;pens&rsquo;. Sorry about the pen-talk, but it gets easier to think as if it came from a pen, even if it doesnt, in our digital age.</div>

To me the s unjulates more than the others. I think you have to decide if you want line variation to be strong or not. The o looks almost monoline compared to the s. Right now, it all looks a bit too constructed without being a geometric face. You might want to decide which way to push it&ndash;looser and more fluid or tighter and more constructed and systematic.</p>

<p>Sometimes, but no – not really, it depends&hellip; but I always get back to them in the end. And, for instance, sometimes it can be that the &rsquo;s' doesnt work (or any other letter) but you feel it is consistent. Then perhaps the best is to redesign the o instead, and then adjust the glyphs after that.</p>
<p>Then of course, it is always nice with a little human touch, so we dont have to follow this mathematically, but as a start I think this is very good.
Btw, your typeface is looking better and better :)</p>

But they could relate to each other a bit more closely. Look too at the top of the g. It is a much heavier stroke overall than the bottom half.heavier even than the o. Try making it slightly lighter than the o.</p>
<p>Another thing. If you have a nice curve you can copy it &amp; then stretch and skew and interpolate (option command P  on mac) it. Even though you have a new curve it will share some dna with the old one. It isn&rsquo;t always what you need, but sometimes it is.</p>

Actually, the g match the others, though there might be some optical thing playing in. Should it be lighter since it&rsquo;s a smaller circle?</p>
<p>Eben: Could you illustrate what you are saying about the joins? The curve stretching is a good advise. Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The classic standard of beauty says that you need unity, variety, and balance. I think the same is true in type design. Unity can become boring, as James said, but variety can become visual noise that doesn&rsquo;t make visual sense as a design. The excellent critiques you got above address the problem of the design not looking coherent. The challenge I think is to have unity of vision that includes lively variety in the execution.</p>
<p>You need a design idea that is rich enough to get both unity and variety, pulled off with balance. This is difficult to bring off, which is why type designs that are really new and great are not so many.</p>
<p>Two interesting recent examples of those who have brought it off are: Christian Schwartz&rsquo;s [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude|Amplitude]], where he has &lsquo;traps&rsquo; all over the place, but changes them significantly with the position and character; and Matthew Carter&rsquo;s [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Rocky|Rocky]], where, as I note [[http://new.typographica.org/2009/typeface-reviews/rocky/|here]], the &lsquo;spikes&rsquo; on different letters are all different, but fit together harmoniously.</p>
<p>Added: I also find it helpful in checking for consistency to look not at curves, but at weights, or widths of strokes. Look at the weights of joints, branches, verticals, horizontals, shoulders, terminals, etc. The goal here is not uniformity, though there is a certain amount of that, but coherence of the design, even &lsquo;color&rsquo; and a nice &lsquo;dance&rsquo; of characters across the line. To me, getting the curves pretty comes after getting the weights to work, and the widths of counters and spacing. But that may just be my thing.</p>

<p>This has been covered some, and in some cases is hard to see in a gif of this size:</p>
<p>g: feels a little boxy in the tail for the roundness in the other letters. Perhaps less weight in the tail join to eye (as in the a). Tail needs more weight on the right. Looks like the top pt could slide right a touch. Could be a hair narrow.</p>
<p>a: a little weighty in the terminal. Bowl, inner and outer curves are too disparate. Outer is boxy, inner is round. Angle on the tail is maybe a little much, and too weighty.</p>
<p>e: crossbar is too thick. Compare to a. Also, a has very even counter spaces. Consider equalizing the e also. For example taking the weight out of the crossbar only from the top. Might be a hair narrow.</p>
<p>o: could be a hair wide.</p>
<p>n: wide. Not sure about the taper on the stem. Feels week to me. Might need to be more deliberate - eg. a curve, or perhaps flaring the outside too. Then again, could be fine.</p>
<p>s: seems a bit narrow.</p>
<p>in general, i&rsquo;d consider shaving the horizontals a bit. o looks ok, but g.eye a.top s.top look a little hair heavy.</p>
<p>This looks like one of the funky grotesques en vogue now: eg Maple and National. So don&rsquo;t regularize too much. I think especially the forms and proportions/widths should stay unique. Color aberations should be fixed IMO.</p>
<p>Nice going!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Randy&rsquo;s advice is very good. The only thing I am not so sure about is the n. About the n: I wouldn&rsquo;t change it until you do some spacing tests. Figure out how big the optimal use size is going to be sort out some spacing and see how it relates to the o at that size. If it is meant to be used quite large with smaller spaces between the letters then Randy is right. If you want it to work at small sizes then I think you may want to keep it as is. I would leave the g out of the development until you have the rest of it more definite. The g is fun but it distracting. Designing it doesn&rsquo;t contribute dna to the rest of the face. I suggest things like d v and an h instead. Then j &amp; y.</p>
<p>BTW why such closed bowls on the e a s?</p>
<p>I do want to be clear that the joins don&rsquo;t need to be identical. It was more a question of narrowing the range of variation.</p>

<li>The top-right of the &ldquo;e&rdquo;, I think that needs to be a little bit wider, so that it fits the top-left side (optically).</li>
<li>Same issue with the &ldquo;s&rdquo;, bottom-left seems a little bit to narrow in comparison with top-right (optically). I tried to draw it below, in red.</li>
