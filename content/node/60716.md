body: Okay, I'm trying to work with MS Volt to help on working the Open Type subs,
  etc; but so far the only thing I've found remotely resembling an instruction manual
  is the 60-minute training video that has so far put me to sleep repeatedly.  Does
  anyone know if there's an actual instruction manual or something approaching that?  Any
  help would be appreciated, thanks.
