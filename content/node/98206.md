body: "Currently finishing the layout of a work on architectural theory and aesthetics,
  originally published in English, though now it's the German edition I'm involved
  with. We've replicated the design in most aspects, however the Baskerville italic
  used extensively throughout for titles, references,  introductory quotes... it just
  looks very tight and condensed by default (or perhaps even more so in the German,
  contrasting with lengthier words).\r\n\r\nIs it a kind of type crime to stretch
  the font ? I recall hearing it's preferable to use another font altogether if the
  italics look wrong. "

    you would find something that says to German readers what Baskerville says to
    English readers (assuming Baskerville <em>was</em> originally a good choice).\r\n\r\nPablo,
    I think your project is a great opportunity to reduce the confusion of calling
    the Fry's cut \"Baskerville\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thank you, and I'm assuming switching out both the regular and italic rather
      than just the italic, is best?\r\n\r\nYou know, what the Baskerville to me says,
      in conjunction with the subject matter, is really a point of interest. The book
      has recently been republished (in English) by another press in an updated edition,
      and totally redesigned. I'm more fond of the original Baskerville, somehow.
      The text itself is a weighty contribution to architectural theory in the area
      of phenomenology, condensed into a book containing less than 100 pages. A degree
      of humility is expressed in its brevity, in what is otherwise a heavy philosophical
      treatise. The Baskerville is elegant and light, and again, this relieves some
      of the weight, for me. Perhaps Walbaum does the same? It's difficult to register
      as a non-native German speaker, but this question of  a kind of equivalency
      in interpretation of styles across cultures, is very interesting."

      which is no small task at this stage. The suggestion just makes sense. We've
      translated the book into a new target language, so why stop there \u2013 why
      not the font as well? How important do others find this; is it essential?\r\n\r\nThe
      book is by an influential Finnish architect, originally penned in English, now
      translated into German. Comments very appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    for Germans as Baskerville does for English readers).\r\n\r\nI'm starting to think
    you should entirely ignore the original font choice and simply find a typeface

      it the cramped condensed quality of Baskerville that makes it poor choice in

    sober. Another possibility is The Foundry's Wilson.\r\n\r\n* To me a serious weakness

  body: "I don't recommend mixing Baskerville roman and Walbaum italic: although they
    belong to close periods of style, and are both associated with forms of neo-classicism,
    Baskerville marks the typographical beginning of this style, while Walbaum belongs
    to the transition to Romanticism. The context here is that English and French
    typography had distinctively neo-classical typography (Baskerville and Fournier)
    and then distinctively Romantic typography (mostly using imported types in Britain);
    while Germany went fairly directly to the Romantic style but not with such extreme
    forms as the French and Italian. Hence Walbaum, which is classed as Romantic,
    but which is generally considered easier to work with than Didot or Bodoni.\r\n\r\nAll
    that said, and following Nick's suggestion to use a new typeface by a living designer,
    I would recommend taking a look at <a href=\"http://www.typejockeys.com/fonts/Ingeborg\">Ingeborg</a>,
    which is in the Walbaum tradition but even better suited to running text. I think
    it is one of the best products of the type design MA programme at Reading.\r\n\r\nRomantic
    types lend themselves to fairly short texts of the kind you describe, that benefit
    from slow and thoughtful reading. This is why they are often used for poetry and
    essays."

    body: Experimenting now with Walbaum... it really appears less elegant to my eye,
      but I suspect it would appear more normal to German readers. Other versions
      should be sampled, h0wever, initially, the weight throughout most of the line
      more dense.
