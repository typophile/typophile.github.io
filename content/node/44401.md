body: "Hi everyone - I've designed some logos for a US company, and they're getting
  them made into vinyl stickers (like the Oakley stickers people have in their car
  windows for example).  Anyway, the company that does the stickers uses Corel 8,
  and a program I've never heard of before - Omega.  Now, I'm sending them eps file
  & pdf files, both of which they say they can't open in Corel, and if it won't open
  in Corel they say they can't use the file...\r\nSo here are my two questions;\r\n\r\nfirst
  off, what version of Illustrator eps (version 7, 8, 9?) do I need to save my logos
  as in order that Corel can accept them?\r\n\r\nSecondly, does anyone know of this
  Omega program?  If I can find info out about it, then maybe the company can skip
  the Corel side of the process and take the file straight into Omega.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nJH"

    on the version of CorelDRAW. \r\nI usually choose Illustrator 3 to be on the safe
    side. (Yes 3, no kidding)."

  body: "Thanks for the swift response everyone.  Ralf - I did indeed save the files
    as version 3.0 EPS's, and I'm told it worked this time.  I'm guessing he has a
    really old version of Gerber Omega otherwise he would (surely) bypass Corel and
    just drop the eps files right in there - unless there's a stage I'm not aware
    of that need Corel.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: Yea, the Gerber software can be quite finicky actually. I've used an older
    version of a program by Gerber called Composer for vinyl cutting and it rarely
    opened, or imported, .AI files, regardless of the version. Illustrator 3 EPS files
    seemed to do the trick, I'm hoping that's been worked out in some of the newer
    software but who knows.

  body: It's already been answered, but yes, Illustrator 3 is the only version Corel
    seems to support properly. It's really annoying, thankfully I've not dealt with
    a sign shop using Corel in years.

    a small stall in one of the malls in the Orlando area of Florida, so I guess he
    can't afford to upgrade from Corel to either Illustrator or just a new version
    of Corel.\r\n\r\nThanks again to all the responses, it really makes a difference
    getting help out there.\r\n\r\nJH"
