body: Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I am extremely glad I stumbled across this forum. I&#39;ve
  read a great deal of posts, and am extremely impressed by the quantity and quality
  of feedback. <BR> <BR>Maybe I could ask for your help. I designed this logo for
  my own freelancing business, but I think it could use an update.  <BR> <BR>I want
  to emphasize the notion of sequentiality, building, and progression in the logo.
  <BR> <BR>My second goal is to use a more modern design and &#40;especially&#41;
  typeface. I don&#39;t think I really like this font as much as I did when I designed
  the logo a while ago. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any assistance rendered! <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Nice start.  colors look good together. Dots have been done a lot in the
    dot com boom, but I have not seen them done exactly in this sequence/composition.
    I am not sure, but perhaps a bit dated? I still like it. &#34;ti&#34; seem a little
    small. bowl on &#34;a&#34; a bit large with respect to negatiev space above bowl.
    &#34;o&#34;&#39;s a bit small, should usually reach a bit above and below x-height.
    perhaps most characters are same width, they need to be optically adjusted. As
    is &#34;n&#34;s and &#34;u&#34; seem toog big as the negative space within the
    characters open it up too much. Try to un-focus your eyes as you look at this
    and you will notice these characters stand out from rest. <BR>I personally like
    when letters with long verticals align, but this is not always possible. '

  body: Why is it Sequential, what does that mean? Maybe what you need is a tagline
    to frame the context of what Sequential Communications is/are.

  body: Ole, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the tips about the font. I think that a complete
    change might be in order. Do you have any suggestions/names? <BR> <BR>Daniel,
    <BR> <BR>Sequential was only chosen because I liked the name. As I mentioned above,
    I like the connotation of progression and building. As for a tagline, I suppose
    I left one out because I was concerned about overcrowding the visual space. Even
    so, I&#39;m not sure what to add. I don&#39;t really specialize in anything and
    I almost feel like adding a tagline would be redundant... <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    the comments so far!
