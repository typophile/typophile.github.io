  body: Well, there are a lot of font managers, but a lot of them are pretty crap.
    I've tried [[http://www.proximasoftware.com/fontexpert/|FontExpert]], which is
    not super, but it is not too bad either. I don't run Vista, but the website says
    [[http://www.proximasoftware.com/fontexpert/|FontExpert 2007]] is also for Vista.

  body: "Note that you don't actually require ATM to use Type 1 fonts (PFB/PFM) under
    Vista. Of course, you may still want to use a font management tool of some sort.
    Currently, Windows font management is unexciting IMO.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    PFB/PBM fonts!\r\nYour contribution was really appreciated.\r\nThanks again :)"
