  body: "I checked this one and I believe we are looking at two different typefaces
    here. While the \"copy\" indeed appears to be <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts\">House
    Chalet</a> (good one Sebastian), the logo shares several character traits with
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.116138.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Cravendale&sampleSize=48\">Neuzeit
    Grotesk</a>, apart from the more closed UC 'C'.\r\n\r\nUltimately though, I think
    the logo was hand drawn, as the lack of optical corrections where the curves hit
    the the straights seem to indicate."
