  body: The head of the paper looks like it might be custom. If you compare for instance
    the two a&#39;s and the the two l&#39;s you will see that they are not identical.
    <BR>A font similar to this one but not at all exactly could be <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/F/LNTQ/F_LNTQ-10005000.jhtml">Linotext</a>
    <BR>But you could also try browsing through the fonts of <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm">
    Dieter Steffmann</a> there might be some candidates. <BR> <BR>The heading looks
    a bit <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=201431">Helvetica
    Extra Compressed</a>. But then again this isn&#39;t an exact match.  <BR> <BR>Have
    patience, though. Someone is bound to know the face. They always do here. <IMG

  body: Hey Guys, <BR> <BR>Just an update, if this helps. <BR> <BR>This is a scan
    from a newspaper prop from the 1978 Movie, so obviously fonts designed pre-1978.
    I also understand that the type has an appearance of hand lettered, the &#34;a&#34;
    &amp; &#34;l&#34; dont match 100%, and was most likely cut &amp; pasted to create
    the design, pre desktop publishing programs, if someone was creating movie newspaer
    props now, ie. Spiderman Daily Bugle, but I&#39;m sure the headline Daily Planet
    is based on an existing font. <BR> <BR>I thought the SUPERMAN SAVES NATION type
    would be easy, well not for me anyway, but dont let me down Guys, <BR> <BR>Cheers.

  body: I think that Daily Planet just might be a modification of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cloister-black/cloister-black/testdrive.html?s=Daily%20Planet&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Cloister Black</a>. <BR> <BR>Did you look through Herr Steffmann&#39;s
    collection, as magnus suggested? <BR>If so, you would have found that he offers
    two quite similar digitizations of <BR>Cloister Black. One, <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/i/iglesia.htm"
    target="_blank"> Iglesia Light</a>, is, I think &#40;I have both&#41;, slightly
    heavier <BR>than BT&#39;s Cloister Black &#40;ironic, given the naming of each&#41;.
