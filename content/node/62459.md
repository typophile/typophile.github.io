  body: "Mark is dead on but his link references the Adobe version with only 4 styles.
    (Book & Demi)\r\n\r\nHere is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/lubalin-graph/\">ITC
    Lubalin Graph</a> from ITC with 20 styles and the 'Bold' style used in the majority
    of the two ads. It also appears a stroke was added on most of the type."

  body: 'Further looking at the type seems that it is extended. Is there an extended
    version? The added stroke is dead on, I also stretched the type and it fit perfect.
    I just find it hard to believe that whoever designed these ads stretched the type. '

  body: There is no extended version. They just stretched it. (Not a good idea for
    a geometric face like Lubalin Graph.)
