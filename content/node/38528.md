  TYPOGRAPHY WITH LOMOGRAPHY IN A WAY BECAUSE I DO FEEL THAT IN TYPOGRAPHY, WE ALL
  HAVE THE FREEDOM AND NOTHING LIMITS US. (THOUGH THERE ARE PROBABLY RULES OR GUIDELINES
  IN TYPOGRAPHY SUCH AS KERNING, SPACING ETC..) BUT THE ALL IMPORTANT THING AND THE
  BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PASS OUR MESSAGE ACROSS AND AT THE SAME TIME,
  WE FIND OURSELVES LIMITLESS IN WHAT WE CAN DO.\r\n\r\nAND OH BY THE WAY, KNOW MORE
  ABOUT LOMOGRAPHY PHOTOGRAPHY HERE: WWW.LOMOGRAPHY.COM"
