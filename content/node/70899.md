  of central european and cyrillic glyphs, especially I am interested in bold italic
  font. Thank you all very much.

  body: "Aside from whether \"true\" italics are suitable for a sans, the Frutiger
    Next italics are a bit off, with too much skew on the curves of a, d, g and q.\r\nThe
    derivative Myriad gets that detail right.\r\n"

  body: 'Frutiger says in Frutiger: The Complete Works that the oblique italics are
    more suitable for a sans. So the recent Neue Frutiger (2009) is more faithful
    to his vision than Frutiger Next (2000). It also reversed compromises that were
    made for the Linotype photo unit system, I believe. '

    to Myriad Pro Bold Italic, not making a value judgment on the italics.\r\n"
