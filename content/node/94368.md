  I'm hoping this time someone sees it who can help\u2026 I'm looking for the now-no-longer-in-circulation
  cut of Bembo by Berthold. It's used by the publisher dtv to this day, so it must
  be out there. If anyone can help me locate it I would be so grateful!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nMichael"

    body: That depends how you define 'out there'. I was using it in the sense of
      'out there in the world' rather than 'her new haircut is a little out there'.
      So your having those applications would (to me at least) mean they exist 'out
      there'. So did you have any information on Bembo BQ?

  body: "My point is that there are several fonts that were commercially available
    at some point and, for a reason or another, were retired from the market.\r\nThis
    means that who purchased them at the time could still be using them, but someone
    who wants them now will need to look for alternatives.\r\nBut, of course, someone
    on Typophile could want to sell you their license. Or know some old software bundle
    you still can hunt on eBay. \r\nFor that, I\u2019m sorry, I cannot help."
