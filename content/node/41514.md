  I think I have finalized it. I'm really happy with the letterforms but I wanted
  to see what some of you thought. It's obviously a display face and yes it does pay
  homage to Avant Garde. It was also designed based on a grid.\r\n\r\nLet me know
  what you think. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Enotmik_6010.jpg]"

  body: "It looks very interesting to me. I like it!\r\n\r\nBut I have some questions:\r\n\r\n-
    Why do the apex and vertex of the letter N end peaked? In my opinion it should
    be like the M, V and W.\r\n- The upper end of the G's throat seems to end above
    the arms and crossbars of E, F and H.\r\n- Why did you fill the bold glyphs' counters?
    It looks like stencils, but why? It's not what the font looks like.\r\n- I think,
    that the curly braces don't fit in your obvious concept. They don't seem to be
    created on the grid.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, I like the font! Especially, I like
    the M, Y and Q.\r\nWhat about the lowercase?"

  body: "Alfred, thanks! I'll answer your questions in order.\r\n\r\n1. I made the
    vertices that way on the \"N\" because if I kept it consistent with the M, V and
    W, the \"N\" looks too wide. It didn't fit in and felt bigger than all the other
    letterforms. It also makes the N unique.\r\n\r\n2. I see what you are saying but
    I can assure you it's aligned with the E, F and H. It's possibly an optical illusion,
    which I don't see, but I will explore it.\r\n\r\n3. I filled in the counters to
    give the typeface a unique feature. I like it a lot, especially when the it's
    used at large sizes, but I'm also considering a version with counters.\r\n\r\n4.
    The curly brackets were created on the grid and use the same corner angles and
    thickness as the rest of the forms.\r\n\r\n5. I tried doing some lowercase letters
    but they weren't working out well in the grid but I'll revisit it soon."
