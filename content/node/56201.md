    but there are some similar fonts: Water Brush by Rob Leuschke, Blaze from SIgnfonts
    (not Adobe font by same name); Scriptorama Tradeshow by Jason Walcott (Veer);
    Hauser Script (Red Rooster); and Banshee (Adobe).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I suspected that it might be original and not a typeface, however I overlayed
    several of the letters and they are dead on. I'm guessing that whatever it is,
    it has an extensive glyph set with multiple alternates. I appreciate the suggestions.
    Thanks.

  body: "Do you have more samples or something? I don't see any repeated letters that
    are the same. The 'n' is close, but not \"dead on\". Otherwise, every repeated
    letter is different from its brothers.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: 'Unfortunately, that is all that I have. The jgp posted doesn''t do justice.
    I have a vector that I was matching letters against each other. There are variations
    to certain letters, but the base of the ''n'' ''u'' and ''i'' are the same. That
    is what I was referring to. '
