  cursive and something that can be easily read (even at smaller sizes).\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to add to the unique, hand drawn feel that the site will have. The site is
  for my graphic design portfolio and will have watercolor paint and paper as the
  background texture.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated! Also, if there's
  anyone who thinks that their own font might work, please let me know:)\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    send in your own handwriting to The Font Garden.  They'll turn it into a font

    The question is: Is your handwriting legible?\r\nHere it is some excellent Type
    Foundries specialized in handwriting/lettering:\r\n- Sudtipos\r\n- Borges Lettering\r\n\r\n-
    DStype has the great Ventura (Dino is not a specialist in handwriting but Ventura
    is worthwhile to see)\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: mb - I like many of those too, but I would call most of those decorative scripts
    by professional letterers, not natural, everyday handwriting.

  body: "Stephen, you're right.\r\nVentura from Dino is a calligraphic font, and the
    others are more decorative script/lettering fonts. \r\nBut as you say, we can
    find some handwriting fonts like: Tiza; Romy; Pronto... \r\n\r\nMaybe FF Mister
    K from FontFont is more what you're looking for...\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

    which one works. I think Tiza is an interesting one... not what I thought I was
    looking for at all, but I really like it.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
