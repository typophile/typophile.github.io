  body: "Reading the Wikipedia article suggests that the single-story lowercase G
    is not merely a feature of modern sans-serif typefaces, modelled on children's
    handprinting, but was also found in blackletter.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, that is the
    case.\r\n\r\nThus, one might better ask: where did the <em>double-storey</em>
    lowercase G come from? The Wikipedia article also gives an answer to that: in
    Roman type, it allowed descenders to be shortened.\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't <em>quite</em>
    explain why it was found in the typefaces of Nicholas Jenson, instead of waiting
    until American Type Founders came along..."

  body: I like 'closed tail' and 'open tail' a lot more then 'single story' and 'double
    story.' The later just seems so modern. I would find it a little hard to believe
    that Garamond referred to the forms as such (though I don't think her ever produced
    the open tail variety, am i mistaken?).

    and nod.

  body: A binocular "g" with an open tail is what's known as a "double story with
    walk-out basement".

  body: I like double story with walk-out basement. I seem to recall a discussion
    somewhere here on names for punctuation points and such like. When I was an apprentice
    comp., way back when, we used to call exclamation marks "dogs' willies".
