body: "Hello friends. After a hiatus of about a year (cataracts operations restored
  vision, and  the Japan earthquake survived!) I am back here on these Typophile Arabic
  Forums that I had the pleasure to help initiate with colleagues. \r\n\r\nI am a
  bit puzzled about the behavior of some Arabic fonts on the Mac and how to generate
  Arabic fonts that work properly on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and using the Arabic
  (QWERTY) input method. Here are some questions:\r\n\r\n1- On some applications like
  TextEdit and Photoshop my fonts display properly, but on others such as Pages or
  OpenOffice the complex script is outputted with the letters disconnected.  This
  is not a problem with the applications themselves because Arabic fonts supplied
  by Apple like Al Bayan and Baghdad display properly there. I looked at Al Bayan
  and it has no classes whatsoever yet it works perfectly. This is puzzling!\r\n\r\n2-
  On some applications like GIMP the keyboard does not even type Arabic at all.\r\n\r\n3-
  Is there a Fontlab setting or workaround that allows generation of OT Arabic fonts
  that work on the Mac?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your experience with these issues and
  how to resolve them."

  body: "Some applications use old system text layout APIs that does not support OpenType,
    so only AAT fonts (e.g. Apple supplied fonts) will work, I know that OpenOfice
    (and LibreOffice) are so, may be Pages as well.\r\n\r\nNo idea about GIMP problem,
    but it seems to be a text input issue rather than text layout, but if everything
    else is fine OpenType should work in GIMP as well since GTK (its the UI toolkit)
    has its own text layout engine.\r\n\r\nIf you are building your own fonts, you
    may want to make them hybrid OpenType/AAT fonts, but I don't think FontLab can
    create AAT fonts, you'll have to use separate tools from Apple."
