body: "Hey everyone, so I'm looking for a similar font to this picture.  The font
  in this picture isn't a font, it's a custom made logo.  I'm just looking for fonts
  that have the same vibe or would fit nicely if I wanted to add a U at the end so
  it'd say APKU.  It would also be greatly appreciated if you could list some suggestions
  on what fonts you think would look nicely with it if I were to put some text around
  it, lets say I wanted to incorporate the words \"affiliate program\" in the design.
  \ Let me know what you think!  Any input is greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.americanparkour.com/images/stories/site_images/APK_Graphics/apk1.jpg\"
