body: I have been looking for the font that these numbers came from and only able
  to get close. I do not know what the number 4 and 9 look like as they were currently
  being used by my customer. I need to get as exact as possible on matching this font
  because the customer needs some numbers replaced. Any help is greatly appreciated.
  Thank you in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/needed number font_5305.jpg]
