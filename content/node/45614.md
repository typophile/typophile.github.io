    \r\nBut at first sight, i don't see the spirit of Frutiger (Sans) in it, which
    i expect from the naming Frutiger Serif. \r\nOk, the marketing people could argue
    that it is based on a existing typeface (Meridien) of A. Frutiger, that's why
    it is appropriate to call it this way \u2026 "

    great fonts and learn to combine them. They would much rather just have a Palatino
    Sans, a Meta Serif, and so on. It\u2019s sort of sad, but on the other hand, I
    guess that these brand families will increase the overall quality of design by
    reducing the number of really crappy pairing decisions."

    it more as an original creation and not feel like it was piggy-backing on the
    brand success and innovation of Frutiger (sans).\r\n\r\nAlso, it's too prickly
    for my taste in serifs. The sans is much friendlier on the eyes."

    just want an easy pairing and that just seems like its a lot less fun. It\u2019s
    not that I think the fonts are bad, or that designing them was a bad idea, I\u2019m
    just disappointed that some designers get hooked on easy type decisions. Maybe
    I\u2019m just reading way too much into this."

  body: "I totally disagree. It has nothing to do with an easy pairing. You aren't
    giving type designers any credit if you think that.\r\n\r\nI tend to use only
    a handful of foundries because I really trust their abilities. Does that make
    me lazy as a designer? I trust their designers to make the right choices about
    serif structure, encoding, kerning, etc. It is then up to me to choose. Sometimes
    I do choose a sans and a serif <em>because</em> they were designed to be used
    together and sometimes I don't. I think it makes a lot of sense to design these
    so-called super families and they fulfill an important niche. "

  body: "I have not taken a very close look at the new 'Frutiger Serif' but I've been
    a fan of Meridien for a long time. There was a brief period abut ten years ago
    when, by chance, several books that I read in succession were all set in Meridien.
    I think its unfortunate that Linotype felt the way to market the new weights and
    styles was to rename the type to exploit the better known Frutiger 'brand', since
    Meridien is a nice name, but if it gets the types more widely used, I won't complain.\r\n\r\nI
    read many years ago about a custom newspaper face based on Meridien, but I never
    saw it and I don't know if it was legitimate. Maybe we can look forward to 'Frutiger
    News' from Linotype in future?"

  body: To add to my initial line of thinking, we (designers) should think of type
    designers as being on our team and interested in helping us with our work. Deciding
    not to use a typeface because you think it is lazy is missing out on an opportunity.
    Just because typefaces may be designed to work as partners doesn't mean what is
    designed will be easy. You still have to do the work, choose the point size, choose
    the column width, etc.

    by reducing the number of Ford Explorers with $50,000 in options that end up on
    the road. Sure the Cayenne is awesome, but it feels forced.

  body: "My gut response was very similar to James's. For the four years that I've
    been designing seriously and have had Meridien, I have been a huge fan of it.
    I have certainly enjoyed pairing it with Frutiger, and admittedly hold some pride
    in the fact that I know it makes a good pairing even though they aren't branded
    as a Serif/Sans combo. So, it saddens me to see Meridien updated and renamed to
    follow the current trend for Serif/Sans super-families.\r\n\r\nBut, the logic
    of people like Miss Tiffany seems to prevail in the end. I'm sure many people
    in the industry had similar gut responses when italics were added to fonts like
    Centaur, which were not originally designed with italics but had well known italic
    counterparts. Now we don't hesitate to use Centaur Italic instead of Arrighi.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I would have been more fond of carrying on the Meridien name, but as long as good
    type is proliferated and proper credit (and payment) is given where it belongs
    I have no problem with what the name is."

    be your judge. It is hard for a type designer to anticipate all needs of all text.
    Type designers do their best either on purpose as in a superfamily or by accident
    when 2 different families happen to suit the job together perfectly. The graphic
    designer is the vigilant watchmen who does his best to represent the text or content
    in a suitable way. At least now choices are not limited by the library of the
    compositor you were forced to choose.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
