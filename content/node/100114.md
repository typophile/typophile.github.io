  body: btw - there seem to be two versions of mendoza for sale -- the adobe and the
    elsner and flake -- any idea the differences / which one is better? I would prefer
    the higher quality one - don't mind the price.

  body: no idea, unfortunately. i tend toward adobe if there's a question but if you
    have to match exactly and there are character differences, go with your gut.

  body: "Related to that last question, if anyone knows of any books set in Mendoza
    that I could look at, I'd appreciate it --\r\n\r\nHrant -- I've read your many
    comments about pirating, and though I'm not in your business I can understand
    your cause and support it --\r\n\r\nOn the consumer end, and being a novice consumer
    at that, I must say that it's a challenge to figure out a lot about these fonts
    before I buy them (maybe I just don't know how to research well enough) -- the
    little bit that one can see in the window of fontshop or myfonts or whatever is
    just not enough for someone like me to know what a font is really going to look
    like -- In the last few months, I've spent quite a lot of money on fonts that
    ultimately I don't have a ton of use of for -- in large part, this is because
    there is no way for a basic person like me to know what different fonts look like
    set in a page of text, or whatnot -- I looove that fontsinuse website -- if there
    were a similar sort of site that gave examples of different fonts in use in books,
    it would be of huge use to us end users. \r\n\r\nThanks again to all of you on
    this site -- I've learned a lot from it, and it's been amazingly helpful.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Its stylistic suitability needs to be considered, but in terms of readability,
    it's rock solid. You do also have to worry about it having all the \"parts\" though
    - like the right kind(s) of numerals, smallcaps that work for you, and other things
    your text might need. But if you get the Adobe version you can always get me to
    make any mods you end up needing.  :->\r\n\r\nConcerning piracy, I'm actually
    a pragmatist, and a big believer in Good Intentions. I hope you know what I'm
    getting at without me having to spell it out... The good news is increasingly
    there are ways of trying out fonts without taking out a second mortgage, like
    SkyFonts.com - and they happen to have Mendoza!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant - how would you describe this style? \r\n\r\nThe books are study guides
    for standardized exams -- the font should be erudite but approachable, which I
    know is not an easy combination -- I've written the books, and they are currently
    set in minion -- I know that that's supposed to be the no-fail font, and who the
    hell am I to say it's not right for me, but it's just not right for me -- I'm
    looking for something else, and unfortunately I've been going through a painful
    buy and try approach -- hoping to get some guidance before buying the next one
    to try.\r\n\r\n"

    actually sounds like a good match. But hopefully others will suggest faces that
    are even better.\r\n\r\nBTW, SkyFonts is very new so don't beat yourself up too
    much.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
