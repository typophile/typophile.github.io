		<div class="commentbody">I really do not want to avoid the stars completely. One of the reasons is that the agency's main office will be situated in the cinema centre and I would like to make a association to (movie)stars. But I have to agree with Alex about the blured stars when they are too small. So I tried to replace some of the most delicate by dots.  <BR> <BR>I am presenting four more versions now. I was thinking about making windows on the flying saucer. First I thought that legs won't be necessary then, but now I am thinking about canceling the windows idea. <BR> <BR>Some questions: <BR>Christoph &gt; What purpose could shadow below the stars have? <BR> <BR>Andrew &gt; What does teleporters look like? <BR> <BR>Thanx for your comments. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13024.gif" alt="UFO_logo_version2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Andrew for that teleporters. Now I see what you've meant. And, yes, of course there is too much alien abduction suggestion in it. My intention was to make a funny logo with a smell of sci-fi films of the fifties and sixties. This X Files feature might scare most of the possible turists. But I like your drawings so much and I appreciate how much of your thoughts my project deserved. But of course I accept yours and Chris's suggestion about all-dot-logo. I made my own (very similar to your suggestion) version. And I changed the lower leg a bit (the legs seemed too similar, I think). <BR> <BR>Chris, it is really good you've spoted that UFC. It seems nobody elese (incl. me) did. It really made me think, so, as you can see, I changed the position of that blank space in the upper circle/roof/&hellip; Hehe, I really wouln't like to disappoint those who would expect the Ultimate Fighting Championship&hellip; About grey colour - I am worried about your screen since there was no grey colour in my posts (or do you maybe own a monochrome display). <BR> <BR>Thanks Tanya, at least one, who likes the legless version, but everyone (inc. my client) say that it looks like a car wheel. So I have to cancel it, even it maybe could look good. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13071.gif" alt="ufo_v3"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't say I like the Baker swwosh solution, but I do prefer the way the dome of the spacecraft is a completed elipse. The &quot;C&quot; shaped dome has always looked a bit &quot;nippley&quot; to me, and this solution does help the &quot;O&quot; reading. <BR> <BR>Reviewing all the logos, I am beginning to be bothered by the thickness of the double outline within the inside of the &quot;U.&quot; I'm not sure how to solve it. Perhaps the lower leg (of the ship) balances it a touch when it is black, but I do prefer the versions where the lower leg has white definition. <BR> <BR>Does the swoosh make the logo more vertical than it needs to be? What will by the applications? Sign? Web site? Letterhead?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christoper and Alvaro, you made me think now about making the logo more simple. Thanks Paul for those details i really appreciate it. <BR> <BR>&gt; What will by the applications? Sign? Web site? Letterhead? <BR>All of that and more (posters, employees' uniforms, guides umbrellas, probably vehicles&hellip;) <BR> <BR>&gt; darn, I always wanted one like that.  <BR>Yeah, me too. So I like your logo proposal very much (not sure about my client).  <BR> <BR>Anyway, thanks for your imput. I need a thinking-break now, to decide what to do. I never thought how many possibilities you will suggest. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the idea of rotaing the mark in space, as it were; it feels much more other-worldly hovering like that. <BR> <BR>Integrating the type into the mark is (almost) always a bad idea. It immedaitely limits the versatility of the logo in terms of scale. I.E. the&quot;travel agency&quot; type becomes illegible when the logo is reduced even to a reasonable size. Also, reversing the type out of the beam is a bit contrived, no? <BR> <BR>I'd suggest letting &quot;UFO&quot; just be on its own - it's much more confident representation of an enigmatic name. If you want to include the descriptor, let it live somewhere else (the bottom or side of a letterhead, tha back of a card or t-shirt, the wall of the office, the title bar of a web browser, etc.)  <BR> <BR>Just some thoughts. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13321.gif" alt="UFO"> <BR> <BR></div>
