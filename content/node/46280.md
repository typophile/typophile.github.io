  body: The low-slung crossbar of the 'A' looks more like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/frankfurter_medium/|Frankfurter
    Medium]] to me. It has been slightly modified to add the stencil-like break on
    the 'A', The 'C' looks like it has been slightly squooshed to make it sit better
    within the circle.
