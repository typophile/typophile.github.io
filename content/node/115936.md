    Three weights, italics, ornaments. For some reason this reminds me of a spaghetti
    western.\r\nThe wedge or triangular serifs originated with a 19th century font
    category called \"Latin.\"\r\nYou might also like the somewhat similar font Latin
    CT http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/ \"With six widths (from Extra
    Condensed to Wide), Latin CT offers the most extensive collection of Latin fonts
    available, each with a large character set that includes support for all European
    languages including those that use the Cyrillic alphabet.\" \r\nThere almost certainly
    other Latin fonts that are close matches.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks everyone, that was very helpful! Goblin (Google Fonts) is the closest
    look to the searched for font, as it's elongated and the wedges are not as large
    as some of the others mentioned.  Thanks for the info on the Latin category in
    general, interesting to view all of these and see the variations. I learned something
    new here.
