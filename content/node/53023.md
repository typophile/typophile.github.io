body: Wanted to ask what most of you may do with setting your text in large documents,
  do you set your paragraph styles with text to stick to baseline grid then space
  your baseline grid instead of the leading?

    but it does work out alright. It was a bit tricky sometimes not to have so much

  body: I always use the baseline grid when setting large bodies of text (even in
    brochures). I usually use a divisor of the primary body text leading as the measure
    for the grid, which helps with the paragraph spacing, but still keeps things aligned
    nicely.

  body: "I generally rely on a baseline grid that is equal to the basal text leading
    (or sometimes one-half) and feel that this is usually a very useful reference
    to aid the underlying harmony in a complex design. \r\n\r\nHowever, I *never*
    use the Align to Baseline feature. I feel this is far too Procrustean and makes
    it inconvenient to work with syncopated rhythms. When I'm designing a book with
    many elements and many levels of text, simple ratios like 1:2 are not always enough.
    \r\n\r\nI have other techniques that I've developed for maintaining absolute precision
    with a baseline grid, while still offering plenty of flexibility.\r\n\r\nI happen
    to think the Align to Baseline feature is superfluous, and in some cases enables
    sloppy work habits and lazy design thinking (not a personal criticism of anybody
    in particular, just my general opinion about the feature).\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to? I find that a baseline grid forces designers into *good* design habits like
    carefully considering space between paragraphs and heads, or paying attention
    to horizontal alignments between columns.\r\n\r\nIn many-paged documents, if I
    can, I like to use a baseline grid that is 1/2 or even 1/3 of my body leading.
    I try not to baseline-shift except for special cases like heads. Then I make sure
    to set leading, space-before, space-after, etc. to multiples of the grid increment."

    . . .\r\n\r\nHere is an experiment. Get a copy of <cite>Art of the Printed Book,
    1455-1955</cite>, by Joseph Blumenthal (printed by Godine). Take whatever design
    manual you favor as having the best \"design rules,\" and go through the books
    Blumanthal has selected. Likely, according to the set of design rules you followed,
    most of the books are poorly designed and set. Yet most <cite>are</cite> works
    of art, and belong. In fact, they are still fairly easy for a modern audience
    to read, assuming you know the language. Why is that?\r\n\r\nLong texts are to
    be read. That is the designer/compositor's primary job, facilitating reading.
    Snapping copy to a baseline grid doesn't much facilitate this, in spite of what
    some might tell you. Pleasing spatial arrangements are more complex."

  body: "The truth of the matter lies somewhere between never snapping to the grid
    and using this feature without any thought. Like Kent, I never use it. However,
    I have received files from designers who do use the feature. But as I have worked
    with these files, I have seen the designers have also used what pica pusher has
    called \"*good* design habits like carefully considering space between paragraphs
    and heads, or paying attention to horizontal alignments between columns.\"\r\n\r\nIf
    one does pay this close attention to detail, there should be no need to use the
    snap to grid. Perhaps the designers used the snap as insurance.\r\n\r\nRE Charles'
    comment about the Blumenthal book: I'm the guy who did the page composition on
    that book. I know that if one examined Blumenthal's book as well as the books
    discussed therein, one would find plenty of divergence from the book's supposed
    grid. I had to do that to get things to fit and to look good. I did try to start
    all the shoulder heads on the baseline of the adjacent text. One of the most valuable
    tricks I learned as an apprentice comp was how and when to \"cheat\" certain spacings
    in order to achieve other pleasing spatial arrangements. This lesson came not
    from a design classroom nor from a textbook, but from a skilled journeyman.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "<cite> > Kent, can you be more specific as to which sloppy work habits you\u2019re
    referring to? </cite>\r\n\r\nTo clarify: It's the use of the Align to Baseline
    Grid feature (sometimes referred to as \"sticky baseline\" or \"snap to baseline\")
    that I think leads to sloppy work habits -- an inattentive designer can end up
    with several elements all specified with a mish-mash of leadings, paying no attention
    to relationships, and then all of them will magically snap to a grid: the results
    may look clean, but the work habits are sloppy.\r\n\r\n(Believe me, I've had to
    come in and revise documents done this way -- you can't trust the readout of leading
    values, because the program isn't using them if it's snapping to a grid; the stylesheets
    are usually a mess, because there's little consequence to overriding everything,
    or no motivation to update and clean them up, etc.)\r\n\r\nAs you say, working
    with a baseline grid (but not necessarily \"snapping\" everything to it automatically)
    can encourage more attentive design, by highlighting alignments and relationships.
    To be clear: it's the \"snapping\" feature that I find problematic.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to my \"lazy design thinking\" comment, this goes along with what Charles
    was getting at. Over-reliance on a baseline grid (especially \"snap to\") promotes
    a cookie-cutter approach. \r\n\r\nSometimes, you have to turn the grid off and
    use your eyes. Just because it's on the grid, doesn't make it right.\r\n\r\nAs
    Charles so eloquently put it, \"pleasing spatial arrangements are more complex.\"
    I like that.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n(Long enough for you ;-)"

    grid to the text leading I'm using for a book, but it is just there to aid the
    eye. With InDesign, I spend at least half the time working with it turned off.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    we can sum it up this way: It is a tool, and like any tool, under some circumstances
    can aid (speed) production, but used without thought, can \"foul\" [things] up
    beyond all repair.\r\n\r\nFair enough?\r\n\r\n(& unending kudo's to Will for the

  body: I use Align to Baseline Grid 9 out of 10 times. Mostly to make sure that lines
    align on two opposite pages, and don't shift for whatever reason. But it depends
    on what kind of project I'm working on. I design alot of poetrybooks, and for
    those Align to Baseline Grid is ideal.
