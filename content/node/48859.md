  Hotel in Chicago:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suttonplace_6638.jpg]\r\nIt's
  a semi-swanky hotel from what I understand (never stayed there). The paper is a
  pretty nice laid finish cotton, but the typsetting wasn't impressive to me. Reminds
  me of when I played with Formatt rub-on letters as a child. "
