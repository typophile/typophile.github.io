  found at http://typophile.com/node/120859.  \r\n\r\nDuring the course of that discussion,
  Vladimir commented that the font had a \"<em>dynamic quality... as if a breeze is
  blowing through the letters...</em>\".  Separately, I've been quietly following
  the conversation about Gill Sans Arabic (http://typophile.com/node/92658), as well
  as other threads here, which touch upon the tendency by some designers to Latinise
  non-Latin scripts.  Chris Lozos posted the following comment in a thread about the
  correct way to draw the Greek letter /Mu/:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>My opinion is that
  Greek text should dance more than say Times Roman Latin. Many Latin faces have glyphs
  which appear as a single gestalt on the page and group together as words with a
  single gestalt. I feel Greek text swings together as a flowing, undulating tango
  rather than marching lockstep in very even time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nEverything
  I'd read made me wonder if it was possible to develop a worthy Greek character set
  for my new font, notwithstanding it's more jitterbug than tango.   This is the first
  draft; it includes only lower case characters at this stage and I'd welcome any
  feedback (please ignore the accented characters for now).\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/f949b115fe.pdf\r\n\r\nFor
  a comparison with the current Latin characters set, please view http://freepdfhosting.com/0ff63ba208.pdf\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much in advance.\r\n"

    appreciate it.  I'm in the process of creating small caps throughout the entire
    font, including polytonic Greek; I'd like to iron out any problems (particularly
    with my regular caps) before doing this.

  body: "I do not think that greek characters should dance tango on the page.  Ancient
    greek inscriptional letters had very simple forms, similar to modern sans serif
    typefaces, before the roman alphabet even existed.  Thus, I think it is a misconception
    that simple, rationalized forms are in any way unsuitable for a greek typeface.\r\n\r\nI
    really like your greek characters, and they match the roman characters nicely.
    \ However, I would remove the little top-right loops on zeta and xi, I think they
    are too much.  I would also try less curved kappa and lambda forms.\r\n\r\n<cite>Most
    of these caps are copies of the Latin characters set - is this correct for Greek</cite>\r\nYes."

    about the kappa and will change it.  However, I'm less enthusiastic about changing
    the others at this time.  The loops on the zeta and xi seem to me to be a very
    typical feature of both Greek handwriting and Greek fonts.  These loops also tie
    in well with the loops I have on the beta, gamma, epsilon and omega.  And, on
    the xi in particular, I can't help thinking the removal of the top loop will leave
    the middle loop looking a bit out of place.\r\n\r\nAs for the lambda, if anything,
    I was concerned mine wasn't curved enough.\r\n\r\nNone of this is to say I'm opposed
    to change, and I'd welcome your further thoughts on this.  "

    \ But, I needed an electron microscope to discern it at anything below 20pt, so
    removed it.  I didn't compensate enough and I agree that the resulting loop looked
    wrong.  Good spot on the inebriated /epsilon/ too... both have been edited.   \r\n\r\nBetter?\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/1eaa10ebda.pdf\r\n\r\nOnce

    /epsilon/ from my earlier update remains unchanged, but the revised /gamma/ has
    since been re-revised and is now harmonious with a similarly revised /nu/.  Is
    it appropriate for these two letters to share the same structure?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the /lambda/ has been made more upright (with a general shape also in keeping
    with the /gamma/ and /nu/), but the top more curved.  This seems to me to be very
    much in keeping with Greek handwriting styles.\r\n\r\nFinally, for now, I've experimented
    with a new form of /phi/.  I saw this looped transition in a calligraphic font
    and thought something along those lines might complement the loops in some of
    my existing characters.  Is it an acceptable form?\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/76846b4628.pdf"

    feels a bit lopsided, how about moving the loop more to the right?\r\n\r\nThe
    /lambda looks a bit like Elvis in flared pants. Maybe you can counter that impression
    a bit by bowing the legs a bit towards the outside. \r\n\r\nWhy the \"wrong\"
    pen angle in /eta and in the middle of /Xi?\r\n\r\nCould the bowl of /Phi be made
    bigger somehow? I believe the stem is often extended beyond the base-/cap-lines
    in the Cyrillic equivalent to make it fit in with the other caps optically.\r\n\r\nHow

    :)  Nice catch on the /eta/... I've corrected the stroke ending.  The 'error'
    on the /xi/ (and also on the /kappa/), however, was deliberate.  I didn't see
    a good way to have the NE/SW diagonal strokes agree with the pen without making
    them either very curly or very thin.  I justify this by telling myself that Greek
    is full of these anomalies but, if you could suggest a workable solution, I'm
    more than happy to explore it.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/79f4f73561.pdf\r\n\r\nI
    have to step away for a while, but will take a look at the /Phi/ and /Omega/ later
    this afternoon.  A quick question about the /Omega/... given it evolved by taking
    a chunk out of an /Omicrom/, is the underscored version considered appropriate?\r\n"

  body: Yes, I think the new zeta and xi drawings are better.  But have you made them
    different by intention?  In my opinion they should match.  I actually think the
    zeta in your last example looks better than the xi, maybe because the top left
    and top right parts optically balance each other out.

    suspect I'm going to ultimately have to offer the underlined form as an alt, but
    I'd love to be persuaded otherwise! :)\r\n\r\nAs for ligatures, I've been debating
    what to do about them.  I was researching the subject a few days ago and came
    across an interesting article by William H Ingram.  It includes a great many historical
    ligature forms, some of which are quite extraordinary.  Check out, for example,
    the ligatures for '\u03C5\u03C0\u03B5\u03C1\u03C3\u03C5\u03BD\u03C4\u03B5\u03BB\u03B9\u03BA\u03BF\u03C2'

    at the top of page 3 (which is numbered 373 in the document)!\r\n\r\nObviously,
    very few of these are appropriate for this font, but I think it would be interesting
    to include them as part of a handwritten font project.\r\n\r\nhttp://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/11391/4169"
