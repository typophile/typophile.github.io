  and understood by those who need to read it. I have seen the cap Eng with the cap
  N used as in Garamond Prem. Pro (see below) and as done in Gentium, where the cap
  Eng looks like an enlarged version of the lower case eng (using lc n).  Which will
  read best to most people?\r\n\r\nBelow is a graphic showing both:\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eng_5392.png]"

    alphabet in Lapp, and in its lowercase form, widley used in lingustic and lexicography.
    It represents the ng sound in the word wing. (Note the different sounds represented
    by the same letters in the words wing, Wingate, singlet and singe.) Thought it
    is ISO character, the eng is missing from most text font."

    Eng are also used in the western African language of Hausa. In this African language
    the preferred design for the uppercase Eng is one that has a rounded top similar
    to a lowercase n.\"\r\nChrisL"

    eng.smcp2];\r\n\r\nyou could also make a stylistic set that makes the same substitutions.
    This makes it easy to implement on the application end too (for InDesign CS2 users)
    until the locl feature is actually acessible by software apps.\r\n\r\n"

  body: i'm afraid i grossly oversimplified what needs to be done, chris. To see how
    to properly implement the language and script tags, follow Adams advice above
    and check out Adobe's [[feature file|feature files]] that they have made available
    to the public to see how to properly write the coding. Thank you Adam, for clearing
    up my statement above.

    2 Oct 2006:\r\nWith the current FontLab Studio 5.0.2 it is not possible to add
