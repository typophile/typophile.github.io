		<div class="commentbody">thanks so much for the replies <BR> <BR>Jacques - I don't believe I fully understand what you're saying - but what I think are your ideas are interesting - I'd imagine transposing the 'texture' of this font under a different / more typical screen font could maybe lead to some surprises. <BR> <BR>the font came from a few different ideas, most prevalent was the old DOS boot-up screen font; I'm pretty sure that has the same 'scanline' look to it.  also old fonts that worked w/ dot matrix printers&hellip; anyway there's gotta be at least a few fonts like this already in existence&hellip; like rodolfo's ;) <BR> <BR>found the limitations in making this font to be interesting though, which is pretty much why I made it.. I definitely agree with you stephen about the 'y'&hellip; sticks out like a sore thumb actually <BR> <BR>again thanks very much for your comments and ideas.  it means a lot, I don't know what I'm doing :D <BR> <BR>- andrew</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andrew, make Paul Rand with his striped version <BR>of City for IBM the first of us. ;)  <BR>Your face has merits, mine was an incomplete <BR>one-off affair. <BR>About the 'y': what's interesting is that you've <BR>achieved almost an italic construction in letters <BR>like b, g. Quite a feat, considering the <BR>constraints. You should try to obtain the same  <BR>suppleness in other characters, like the y that's <BR>been mentioned. Just as an experiment, I've tried <BR>two alternatives to your y: <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1948.gif" ALT="temp_ac.gif"> <BR> <BR>I've also fiddled with the v and the d (in the word  <BR>'traded'). You could try to 'italicize' more your <BR>design (italicize, not slant ;) <BR> <BR> <BR>&gt;Rodolfo, what about that font you used for your typographi.ca banner? (V2000?) It looks interesting, like it has *vertical* scanlines, and it's made of two fonts that combine in different colors or something&hellip; Wazzat? <BR> <BR>Hrant, that 'font' was done in fact for print. It <BR>was a set of pseudo-bitmaps I designed to use in <BR>a poster. The idea was that odd and even &quot;vertical <BR>scanlines&quot; were differently colored - but with some <BR>&quot;pixels&quot; out of place according to letter structure <BR>(in the case of the typographica banner, *many* <BR>pixels). This construction principle allowed different <BR>shapes to emerge. I think I have an image of the <BR>thing as it was used somewhere. If I find it, I'll <BR>post it. V2000 was a codename (the poster was <BR>called &quot;Verão 2000&quot;, which means &quot;Summer 2000&quot;.)</div>
