  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So ladies and gents, I&rsquo;m working at a company that is pretty much just forming an in-house design department. I have a few questions that I&rsquo;m hoping to find answers to.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How much is a reasonable target price to get a design firm up and running? We have virtually NO purchased typefaces, most are system fonts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some of the best valued combined packages that contain multiple typefaces? I need the classics too (I can&rsquo;t live without Univers.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also need some more modern typefaces to keep things fresh, any suggestions on more modern packages? (I also can&rsquo;t live without the Thesis Family.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I convince my company that after taking the huge hit financially in purchasing a &ldquo;classics&rdquo; package that modern typefaces also need to be part of the budget?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping a few of you might be able to point in the right direction. I know the subject of price is a touchy subject so if you&rsquo;d rather not discuss it in a public forum please e-mail through the link on Typophile or at the e-mail address listed on my site. Thanks all!</p>

<p>I’m working at a company that is pretty much just forming an in-house design department.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised no one asked for an explanation to this. What type of company would decide they want to set up an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; design department, that would need to be stocked with a wide range of typefaces?</p>
<p>Most companies I&rsquo;ve had experience with set up an in-house design department so that they can remove or reduce their dependency on the outside design firms they use. Either they want to do everything in house or they want to do the grunt work in-house to cut out the middle-man&rsquo;s markup. Either way they’d normally start with the fonts their existing design resources are using and then acquire additional fonts as the need arises. But maybe I’m missing something?</p>

<p>The company didn&rsquo;t decide. As a designer, its just very hard to design without having much type to choose from. We&rsquo;re missing many necessary fonts.</p>

Bitstream&rsquo;s Type Oddity, sorry, Odyssey, will provide all the classics, including your fave, Zurich. For a Typophile, there&rsquo;s hours of fun there just relating the wacky names to the proper ones. Also included are new fonts from a variety of independent foundries (self-interest declared).
It&rsquo;s affordable, but not the latest versions, and not OpenType.
However, it delivers the canon, and in a way that doesn&rsquo;t make it indispensible. So when a job cries out for a spiffy new OT typeface, you should be able to justify the expense, because there&rsquo;s nothing like that in the collection, and continue to add to your library in that way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, yeah I participated in that thread. I think it was called All-American Type or something like that. I just don&rsquo;t think that Arial is acceptable to use for every ad campaign. There is plenty of good type out there that is not too in your face. Off the top of my head Griffith Gothic and Knockout are two faces with a lot of personality, that I could see being used for political ads. I don&rsquo;t think either one would annoy a potential voter. System fonts used in print ads annoy <em>this</em> potential voter.</p>
<p>Nick, thanks for the suggestion. Wading through the &ldquo;Humanist&rdquo; faces is indeed an ordeal.</p>

Politicians and very large organizations are committee addicts and make decisions based on what is &ldquo;least objectionable&rdquo; and won&rsquo;t make a negative soundbite. Since the marketplace for political campaigns is perceived by them as being &ldquo;Gaff grabbers&rdquo; as opposed to ground-breakers, I don&rsquo;t think they fear market loss by lack of innovation.</p>

<p>I guess you think that he should license fonts on a per per project basis, as is needed. This is not a bad idea, and I&rsquo;m sure that he&rsquo;ll do that, too. He just wants to license a bulk library of good types to fall back on first, I think.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about stealing, but paying for a font that you&rsquo;ve decided to use after being able to experiment with it would make a lot of sense. Foundries should have a &ldquo;try &amp; buy&rdquo; proposition &ndash; you&rsquo;re free to play with their fonts, but have to pay for the ones you use in designs that you sell (or give away). Isn&rsquo;t there a licensing scheme along these lines out there?</p>

<p>Paul, I agree with you that enforcing licensing policies is a nightmare, but there really isn&rsquo;t much a foundry can do if someone decides to download one of their multi-thousand dollar packages without paying anything. I mean, it&rsquo;s as simple as running a Google search with the words <code>font folio 10 torrent</code> and then using a torrent client to download the stuff.</p>
<p>In the end, all this discussion about licensing &ndash; whether or not a EULA allows for the fonts to be installed on one, two, five, or more machines; whether a PS1 font can be converted into an OT font; etc &ndash; is really a matter of trusting that some people will respect the licence. What are you going to do if someone doesn&rsquo;t? Ever heard of a foundry getting a warrant to check whether one of their fonts is being used on eight computers instead of the allowable five? Or to make sure that the client is not using an OpenType font they created from the PS1 font originally purchased?</p>
<p>My point is, in the real world foundries <em>have</em> to trust their paying customers, because it&rsquo;s just so easy to obtain their fonts for free from illegal sources anyway. And if it&rsquo;s all a matter of trust, why not go the &ldquo;try &amp; buy&rdquo; way?</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re straying further and further from the original topic, but it&rsquo;s my fault.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had type designers give me a tryout before, and I think a brilliant idea is linking that tryout to some printed swag showing the font in use. For a few dollars (less than the font) you can get a good taste—the font designer gets to sell a printed sample rather than giving it away, and the customer gets a disc with a tryout version of the font plus printed sample.</p>

<p>There are many graphic designers who have relationships with type designers, and get all their fonts on a tryout basis. The secret is establishing a relationship with the type producer. That can begin by licensing a fair amount of fonts, and just maybe you&rsquo;ll be put on the short list to get the tryouts. You&rsquo;ll have to sign some legal documents, but hey, what are a few contracts between &lsquo;friends&rsquo;.</p>
