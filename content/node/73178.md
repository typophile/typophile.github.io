  body: 'You''re on the money about that. I can only assume that it''s an eroded (read:
    bastardized) version of Impact Wide, most likely a freebie, but I''ve had a look
    on DF and AbstractFonts and nothing comes to light. The fact that like characters
    are identical indicates that it''s a font in its own right and not a one-off customisation.
    But what it is, I do not know.'
