  body: "A domain will cost you around $8 per year.\r\n\r\nHosting can range from
    free to many thousands. ;o)\r\n\r\nI'd say anywhere from a free WordPress account
    on up to around a $10 per month shared LAMP hosting package would likely meet
    your needs.\r\n\r\n"

  body: doteasy.com has nice hosting packages for around $25 a year. You get your
    domain name registration, email and hosting space for that (with no ads). They
    don't support any of the more intense coding languages like css or anything though.

  body: "they don't support CSS? I'd be worried about that.\r\n\r\nAlso beware of
    web hosts that 'include' domain registration. Some of them will register the domain
    in THEIR name, not yours, so you don't actually own it."

  body: wooloo.org is completely free and can be self-edited on the fly, but it's
    visual material only with work captions, not blogs, I believe. Mine is.

  body: "I don't know exactly what part of css/perl/whatever it doesn't support. Just
    that my backends wouldn't work. But I used them for several years while my websites
    were still just simple flash and html. They were really great. Cheap and good
    customer service. \r\n\r\nAnd I owned the names. Which I have since switched over
    to my own dedicated server.\r\n"

    not support CSS. Perhaps you need to log in with Netscape Navigator 1.\r\n\r\n:)"
