body: Greetings! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m new to this forum so be gentle!  I&#39;m wondering
  what the general feeling is about the &#39;Th&#39; ligature in body text.  It seems
  that many of the Adobe OpenType fonts &#40;WarnockPro, Jenson, etc.&#41; have this
  ligature, and I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s easier to read. <BR> <BR>Is this a
  &#34;feature&#34; for the sake of a feature, or are there appropriate &#40;and inappropriate&#41;
  place for this ligature? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>Chris Swingley <BR>University

  body: Personally, I like it. I think it can get more even spacing for the Th - depending
    on the other features of the font. I was interested to hear at Typotechnica, though,
    that Adobe gets a lot of complaints about the default Th ligature.

  body: William, <BR> <BR>I can imagine the complaints they get because I thought
    it was a defect at first &#40;I&#39;m using TeX, and sometimes the translation
    of formats results in things like this&#41;, but when InDesign did it too I realized
    it was the way the font was designed. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your opinion.  I&#39;ve
    been keeping my eye out for it in print and haven&#39;t seen it yet, but it does
    seem almost a natural ligature given how much white space results around the T
    without it. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Chris Swingley <BR>University of Alaska

  body: I think it depends on the font and the spacing of it, but generally I don&#39;t
    mind it. When I read things set in Times New Roman and I come across Th without
    it, it bothers me. Just for instance. But not as much as not using the fi lig.

  body: Bringhurst doesn't like it. At first I had to double-take every time I came
    across it, but not anymore.

  body: "I'm thinking that the near-future proliferation of advanced reading pads
    (like the iPad) will make the Th ligature an INDIVIDUAL READER option. Each reader
    will get to choose what ligatures he or she likes or doesn't like.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the social network will make the total sum of the reader preferences available
    for all to see.\r\n\r\nSome book designers, typesetters, and type designers might
    get their feelings hurt.\r\n\r\n"
