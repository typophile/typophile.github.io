    understand what you mean</cite>\r\n\r\nAnything, I'd say something like 'Rattlesnake
    Point - Sans Serif' It's just easier if someone wanted to go back and find your
    thread, rather than if all threads were just 'ID this please?' Also if it's a
    more famous ID then people can just jump in and type up a response. Correct me
    if I'm wrong, someone! :)"
