  body: ' Bj, <BR> <BR>This is fun, F-U-N. Some small suggestions: <BR> <BR>1 - On
    some glyphs &#40;B,D,F&#41; the black backing  <BR>takes the form of a shadow
    while on others  <BR>&#40;A,C,E&#41; there is no break in form, creating a 3D  <BR>shape.
    I would seek consistency. Personally, I  <BR>prefer the 3D, because it requires
    more time and  <BR>perfection of craft, but perhaps that wasn&#39;t the  <BR>direction
    you wanted to go. <BR> <BR>2 - Is there a version without the shadow? <BR> <BR>3
    - How about adding alternates with enclosed  <BR>counters that aren&#39;t filled?

  body: ' hello Bj, congratilations for this funny typography. I also would like to
    ask why you have the counter empty on l/c &#40; ABDOPQR &#41;on your positive
    version. I think that make few contrast betten the rest of the caracthers &#40;
    suggestion &#41;. <BR>Good work and welcome with this great idea. Do have more
    versions or weights? <BR>Regards/Ricardo '

  body: ' Thanks for the feeback Stephen and Ricardo. Stephen, I like your suggestion
    to make consistent the shadows on A,C,E. I think I will revise those. Yes, there
    is a version without the shadows. This originally was named Meek Gothic. The idea
    was to have a playful font that could never hurt anyone - no angles or points
    or serifs, just lazy curves. And no dark shadows. But plain, it was TOO MEEK.
    I changed the name b/c I liked the alliteration of Geek Gothic and the shadows
    made it no longer meek. I am working on alternates. Because there is only one
    case, I am filling in with the opposite case &#40;the A, E, etc.&#41; Also, letters
    that have quirks &#40;the phallic I, the cross J, the one-armed Y&#41; will have
    &#39;normal&#39; alternates. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also use unfilled counters as alternates,
    good suggestion Stephen! <BR> <BR>thank you. I&#39;ll post some more stuff later
    this week. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj harvey '
