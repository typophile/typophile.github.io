  references with co-workers or students, to make a foundry portfolio, or as a private
  tool.\r\nYou can [[https://github.com/raphaelbastide/ofont|download, modify and
  contribute]] to ofont on GitHub.\r\nYou can see ofont in use [[http://usemodify.com/|here]],
  in a project that lists libre fonts I like.\r\nOfont is still in development. You
  can submit features on the [[https://github.com/raphaelbastide/ofont/issues|issues
  page]]."
