  Porchez Typofonderie, but it is not. Can you help please?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/granfoulard_6366.jpg]

  body: "I think it may be a customization of Parisine Plus. The 'a' for example is
    an alternate glyph (just with a shorter tail). The 'f' may just have had part
    of the crossbar clipped off. I can see that the G and R are also not straight
    copies, but I believe the modification might be easy enough for someone with some
    skill at manipulating font outlines.\r\n\r\nI kept trying to see if there was
    a unicase version of Parisine Plus, because that would probably look like this,
    but even the PTF web site doesn't show one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "@botinkin I can confirm that its not Parisine Plus as basis for this piece
    of lettering. Basic forms as n are not Parisine. But indeed, there is some effects
    a bit on the same style. Perhaps Myriad as starting point?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePlusPTF"
