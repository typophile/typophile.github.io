<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>EAU CLAIRE, WI – November 16, 2006 Font Diner, Inc. (www.fontdiner.com), a leading retro typography design firm, has announced the revival of the historic Filmotype, Inc. font library created in the 1950s and 1960's.
Filmotype initially manufactured a simple manual phototype machine utilizing display typeface designs on 2-inch filmstrips. Additional films were sold to start-up typesetting companies in order to increase their product selection. Font Diner will create new digital versions of the Filmotype collection, recreating it to meet today's graphic design standards.
Stuart Sandler, President of Font Diner, Inc., intends to release the Filmotype library in OpenType format so the original designs can be fully realized with a dynamic feature set including alternate glyph forms and automatic substitutive ligatures. "We are pleased and proud to reintroduce this unique font collection to an entirely new generation of graphic designers," says Sandler.
"I have seen a disturbing trend in our typeface design industry," he notes, "as more fonts are being poorly digitized from vintage specimen showings. I believe it is important to protect and preserve the future of this historically important collection, numbering well over 500 unique designs."
Graphic designers and the worldwide font community can order the newly designed typefaces at: www.filmotype.com. An illustrated history of the classic Filmotype brand has been carefully researched and is currently being written by Sandler. His work will accurately re-tell the evolution of the Filmotype Corporation, its founders and the significant contribution of Filmotype™ to the typographic industry.
Font Diner, Inc.
Stuart Sandler launched the Font Diner (www.fontdiner.com) foundry in 1996 and has become a major resource for retro design software products. He has created more than 400 original typefaces for the graphic design industry and established a reputation as the premier retro display typography designer inspired by 1950s popular culture. Sandler added a second division to the Font Diner umbrella in 2004 (www.misterretro.com) that features Machine Wash Image Filters™ and Snappy Hour™ vector images. Earlier this year he expanded his corporation again thru a joint venture as publisher of high quality display typefaces (www.fontbros.com). Filmotype is a trademark of Font Diner, Inc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stuart, this is such great news. I love seeing the rebirth of languishing collections of type. Just tell me you're going to charge more for your typefaces starting with this collection ... please.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In the Solotype Catalog of typefaces by DAN SOLO. There is 3 fonts in the book and 1 ive just learned of recently that id like know more about but very little is known about them. One is <strong>EARTH</strong>, <strong>Othello</strong> (Morris Benton) <strong>Bathysphere</strong> created by Gustav Schroeder and <strong>PREVIEW</strong> but it was renamed "AIRLOCK".
Id like to know the creator of those fonts and were can i find the alphabets of those fonts? And other information that is available. And if proper digital versions of specifically EARTH. And are those fonts going to be done in digital if anyone knows?
As there have been some good uploaded versions but none match the original Othello. Ive got many sources for the <strong>EARTH </strong> but sources arent going to be as good the original 2-inch film strips or whatcever the source is.
Ive knowledge of dates and sources for earth font thats in the book. Thats been seen in books, movies and loads more locations.
Any information would be greatly received.
John

<div class=commentbody>Hi Stuart
In your acquired collection. Do you have any of the fonts i mentioned in the paragraph. Such the EARTH font and OTHELLO. I cannot find anything on the internet on the EARTH font at all. Other than ELFRING but its not even close the full character set that's out there. I don't even know if that the EARTH font is the original name of it or who designed. Its all a mystery. In the library you acquired is that font in it. Or the OTHELLO by Morris Benton.
There are no websites that have viewed have samples. Or any sources I could see more of the characters of the fonts mentioned.
John</div>
