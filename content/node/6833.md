  body: Galliard is my favourite font to read after I read it on Letters of Credit,
    I had seen it before but always so badly printed or used.

  body: 1 <BR>I also like Galliard. I have Bitstream and Linotype versions, but would
    like to buy the CC version; however, I don&#39;t need all the package. Is there
    a way to buy specific fonts instead of the full package? <BR> <BR>2 <BR>Furthermore,
    I hate the policy of buying before trying. I&#39;m willing to have another blind
    go, but this has already cost me money I wouldn&#39;t have spent. Anyone knows
    if it is possible to actually try a typeface &#40;say, just the roman&#41; before
    buying? <BR> <BR>Rodrigo de S

  body: why not ask mr carter himself? see john&#39;s post above. <BR> <BR>some vendors
    may supply you with a specimen pdf on request, or even typeset some text for you
    and supply the outlines as an eps.

  body: Rodrigo, <BR> <BR>I would be surprised if the CC version lines up exactly
    with other versions. The Bitstream version is closest to the CC Version, from
    what I understand. I think ITC may have done something with Carter&#39;s original
    proportions.

  body: 'John: <BR> <BR>Yes, I am prepared for that. The Linotype version is very
    different from Bitstream&#39;s &#40;which I actually like much better&#41;. The
    CC version seems to stand somewhere between the two, perhaps closer to BS; so
    I&#39;ll be needing the experts. However, the small caps and the Titling from
    BS or even LT will do, I suppose. They are not that different from CC and, anyway,
    I only use small caps and Titling in headers, where difference will not be noticeable.
    I try to avoid bold, but Bitstream&#39;s is very attractive &#40;as much as a
    bold can be in text setting&#41;. Anyway, if I use it, I again restrict its use
    to headers. <BR> <BR>I hope I can get away with buying only 4 fonts &#40;roman
    and italic osf and the experts&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Thank you for your advice. <BR>

  body: 'This is what Cherie Cone wrote to me: <BR> <BR>&#34;Now, on to ITC Galliard.  Back
    in the seventies, when we were both at Mergenthaler Linotype, Matthew designed
    4 weights of Galliard, each with an Italic version.  They are the Roman, Bold,
    Black, and Ultra weights.  Mergenthaler later licensed the design to ITC, and
    it became ITC Galliard.  When he and I started Carter &amp; Cone, he went back
    to his original drawings and added all the wonderful characters that we had never
    produced while we were at Bitstream &#40;he and I were two of Bitstream&#39;s
    4 founders&#41;.  Anyway, we brought out the package of 11 fonts for Galliard
    Roman and Italic, and we&#39;ve been trying to find the time to fill in with the
    other weights, but we do so much custom work that Matthew hasn&#39;t gotten back
    to that project.  When people want the additional weights, we suggest going with
    the Bitstream version, which was produced under his direction.&#34;'

  body: 'Kris: <BR> <BR>Yesterday a compared I specimen sheet of Galliard CC with
    Bitsream&#39;s: they are not completely alike, but the roman lowercase is very
    close, at least in overal proportions &#40;the descenders are slightly modified
    and perhaps &#40;I was comparing a printed sheet in a 1200 laser to a JPEG image&#41;
    the serifs are a little different, too. The uppercase has slightly less space
    &#40;but I think it is not more condensed&#41;, but otherwise it is the same.
    SO I think yes, they should work together. Linotype&#39;s is a rather different
    fount.'

  body: If you go to a good newsstand and pick up a copy of <a href="http://http://newcriterion.com/">The
    New Criterion</a>, you can see what may be one of the best regular settings of
    Galliard CC, though they don&#39;t use quaint ligatures or ornaments. <BR> <BR>I
    wish Galliard had some swashes. Luckily, FB Meno does a good job of providing
    those.

  body: "Another thing in the *complete package* (but be sure to ask Cherie) are tabular
    old-style figures. The package, as I remember, is has only roman and italic fonts.
    These are Type 1 format, so it takes multiple fonts to contain the characters
    an OT font would have.\r\n\r\nAlso think about the \"Swedish\" version -- it has
    a slightly different lower-case \"f\", which fits better with umlauted vowels.
