  random text. This crap is wonderful: it\u2019s full of oddball words that either
  don\u2019t exist or only a lunatic uses, and because none of it really makes any
  sense I can ignore most of the meaning."

  body: "If you ever need randomized text based on an interview or script format,
    My type professor gave us these interviews from IEEE (Institute of Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers, Inc.). They're wonderfully interesting, but at the
    same time terribly dry:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/oral_history/oh_a_fo.html\r\n\r\nJames,
    I love sample of pretentious black-turtleneck art-speak. It's oozing with bs."
