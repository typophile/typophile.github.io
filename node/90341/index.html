If you remember more please do let me know. I need

Simon: I mean that switching the font doesn't
affect text-flow. So ideally total conformity,
although I guess there could be "levels" to that
that can be switched on/off?

And since you're here:
Do you know if MS and/or Monotype mind the metric
"compatibility" of Liberation, officially or otherwise?
Although now that Monotype owns ascender...  :-/
BTW, the wiki ways "closely match" - might that just be
sloppy/hedgy writing or are there in fact discrepancies?

I can understand looking at a few basic relationships of sidebearings to try to get a certain fit and color as a starting point but a wholesale lift from someone else just makes me very uncomfortable.  Not just for the property rights and honesty issues but just for the assumption that it would work to my liking.

		<div class="commentbody">A font has to be terribly close to an existing font to be able to use the same metrics, kerning, etc. However, I can see the point of temporarily using another font's metrics (and all the rest) when testing it during the design process, instead of constantly having to adjust the spacing and kerning as you change the glyphs. Furthermore, if the fonts are similar, I wouldn't mind at all if someone just took another fonts metrics and changed them a bit to fit his/her own font. It's more efficient in some cases and you can hardly call metrics intellectual property, right?

But how far do you go?

If you have a specific target, it sounds viable. For example, replacing Arial with a custom font in a company's Word templates. (I believe there is a set of fonts in the DBType family that does exactly that.) You could be pretty sure that kerning isn't used, so keeping the horizontal glyph metrics (and vertical font metrics!) should be enough.

If you're targeting InDesign, you need to take into account kerning and other OpenType features that are on by default (ligatures, contextual alternates).

There can be some glyphs that severely limit your choices when you want to stay compatible. For example, an uppercase I with serifs in a sans face (e.g. Verdana). You just can't make it sans-serif and keep the advance width the same.

On a side note, in the IBM Selectric Composer the characters were proportionally spaced, but every letter had to have the exact same width in all fonts! Frutiger notes in his big book that he had to compromise on his Univers adaptation because the engineers had chosen a Renaissance face as their model for the character widths. E.g. the s in the Composer Univers looks much too narrow.</div>

Indeed - and that's what Simon was alluding to.
So, is that an extra legal barrier? An extra ethical
barrier it's not (I mean in terms of already being
OK with copying metrics).

Hm, what's your rationale for this? It's a lengthy process to settle on really good metrics. Also, as many have observed, a well-spaced font with some bad curves is more useable than a poorly-spaced font with amazing curves. I see metrics as an integral part of the design process, requiring just as much skill as the actual drawing, if not more. 

Even if there's no legal copyright infringement, I would personally consider it bad practice that raises ethical issues.</div>

I didn't consider the legality of reproducing OT features, I was more thinking that it would be a design barrier ;) The more restrictions you have, the less you can diverge from the »original« design. For example, if OpenType substitutions occur that replace glyphs by other glyphs which have different metrics. You would have to emulate this behaviour exactly to avoid reflow.</div>

Could a font that copies the metrics of another reduce

I don’t think that’s necessarily so. Often the impetus to provide an alternative that fits/flows exactly as another is to allow document sharing between one party who possesses the font and another who does not, thereby relieving the second party of having to license the original.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Since the question of two typefaces different in style, but designed to have the same metrics, has come up, I thought I might remind people of the IBM Selectric Composer, where faces designed to resemble Bembo, Times Roman, Optima, Century Schoolbook and Garamond, among others, all used exactly the same metrics.

Oh, and here's a link to a page from which you can download a book of the typestyles:

		<div class="commentbody">Richard Fink has been promoting the idea that fonts are not really subject to copyright. 

While I'm personally view open to his ideas on that, my understanding of those who say copyright in the USA does apply to font data is that its based on the Adobe vs SSI case, in which the placement of bezier points was held to be a copyrightable expression, since different people will place the points differently around the same shape, when digitizing an existing design that is scanned into the computer as a bitmap and traced by hand with a bezier tool. 

Following that logic, I can see how the metrics would not be subject to copyright, because anyone would copy the metrics of the original in the same way. 

However, that court case is years later than the classic Bitstream/URW/ScanGraphic/etc clone fonts.

The Liberation fonts aren't a good example, because even before the buyout Ascender had a close relationship with Monotype. Is there any other fonts made in the last 5 years that are well known to have cloned metrics?</div>

The word "promoting" is off the mark and incorrect. I have no interest in "promoting" the idea and have not done so. Discuss it on occasion? Yes. Research it? Yes. Promote it, no. I have no interest in creating bandwagons.

I for one would love to see an objective talk at TypeCon or ATypI that explores the history of "compatible" fonts (as distinct from straight clones) especially in an age of OpenType, class kerning and hinted widths. That talk could be followed by a more subjective panel discussion featuring say John Downer, Richard Fink and a high profile designer who has made compatible fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, that works the other way around. The purpose of it is to <em>exactly</em> match the original font metrics <em>as</em> a temporary workaround until the original font shows up again.

The glyphs themselves get expanded and compressed beyond recognition--but they are in this case <em>less</em> important than keeping the correct spacing and word count.

Adobe pulls off this trick by requiring that if a font is not allowed to be embedded, at least its metrics should.</div>
