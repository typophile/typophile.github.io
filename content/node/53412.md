  order to do this, I have to delete all the outer contours, plus some (very few)
  counters.\r\nAs this is a very repetive task, I thought how nice it would be if
  there were a script or macro for deleting all outer contours of selected glyphs.
  This would simplify the whole thing quite a lot; I'd only have to check for the
  counters again.\r\n\r\nIdea, Resource or Script, anyone?\r\nMany thanks!"

  body: 'I don''t know if there is a script to handle that, but when I read this I
    wondered if just deleting the outer contour would be enough. When I have played
    with some of those type of designs before I usually increase the weight of the
    fill just a hair so the overlap is solid. Also: don''t forget that your inside
    contours will be in reverse compared to the outer ones, so you''ll need to switch
    those over.'

    solution of writing a script myself; for now I have done it all manually, but
    a script will come soon!"
