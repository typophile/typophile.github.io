Godine, and as far as I can tell the only difference is the cover design. The back cover of the paperback states that Tracy died in 1995, and the copyright date is still 1986. There are no new forewords, prefaces, or other updates to the 2003 paperback.</div>

Unless you are crazy about Van Krimpen, Dwiggins or Morrison, this book is not "introductory" in any way.

And about Lieberman: quite a nice book, but not very much up to date (1958).

And at last, about the other two "essentials" (gee, I really don't agree on these by the way), Bringhurst is very good but imho oriented towards the designers, and a little old too; and Lawson is very interesting but terribly boring to read and absolutely not up to date. It contains, though, very detailed information about typefaces prior to the XXth century.

		<div class="commentbody">David, the request was, "I'm very curious about typography in general ... an introductory book... "

I think you assumed that when Victor spoke of the characteristics of "types", he meant particular typefaces, rather than genres of type or typefaces in general.

It seemed to me (and other people who responded) that he is looking for a general introduction, rather than a work themed by typeface.

That is why I thought your statement, "...there was nothing close to what you are asking for..." was absurd, as, obviously, there are lots of general introductions to typography.

Perhaps if I had been <em>more</em> prejudiced (i.e. taken into account that you are French and may have misinterpreted the nuances of the request--spelling errors and all), I would not have offered such a literal criticism!

Nonetheless, your work is, I think, as good a way as any to get deeper into typography--in fact it may be better than those, such as the ones I mentioned, that enforce an author's grand teleological structures.

Let the reader look, enjoy a series of discursive essays, and make up his own mind!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the book, David.
Please send me your address, and I'll mail you one of my books in return.

I've read several of the essays in it, and my first impression is that you've simplified the genesis and history of the types in order to create a grand narrative: myth-building.

For instance, there is your assertion that Cooper Black had fallen from usage mid century, to be revived by the Pet Sounds album cover, a notion which I disproved in a Typophile thread.

With regards to Futura, you state that, "...les premiers succédanés de Futura apparurent dès années 1950..." which is incorrect, as the face was immediately plaigiarized by foundries in many countries in the 1930s, e.g. Intertype's Vogue of 1930.

You explain how DIN typ[eface was "...dédié aux panneaux routiers..." which is incorrect, as it was initially a face used by engineers, dating from well before the first autobahn, and its use, upon adoption by the DIN in 1936, was not especially connected to autobahn signage, which had very few kilometers at that point in time, but was in many media such as type and acetate stencils.

Nonetheless, I do agree that the format of the book, focusing on well-known typefaces with samples of their usage and an accompanying essay, is unique and fascinating.

For the second edition, please include some Shinn types, and I will go a little easier on my criticism :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Nick, you're welcome.

First of all, my purpose has never been to create a grand narrative, but to give basic biographical information about type designers at a time it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so (finding today a detailed (as much as possible) biography of Roger Excoffon or Giambattista Bodoni is almost impossible for a regular student, at least in France, unless you have access to rare and old books in some way). I tried not to simplify too much, but the book is indeed an introduction: I also, therefore, tried not to make it look too much boring. I tried to talk about as many type creators as possible, and also not to go too much over 200 pages. If the book contains some unprecise facts, it is because I couldnt get any more precise information at that time. I am well aware that it contains some mistakes, it is after all talking about a lot of facts that take years to confirm, and I had it read by many people whom you can trust when it comes to being precise and reliable in type history; still, some mistakes went throught the net, though not that much. I can actually see that you focused on the mistakes without talking about the 200 other pages of reliable facts - if you know any other book like this one, please tell me so. I guess the second edition will be much more precise and in many ways corrected, thanks to interventions like yours. But still, I am happy to have produced a book which talks extensively about the life of famous and obscure type designers, about the genesis of type creation (even if you consider it simplified), and which contains at least a crash course on how to choose it well, a starting point into developping your own way to do so. And most of all, the layout is clear, rich in colors, not too boring (hopefully), so that it may attract students and other people into reading it. It's not what you consider a "perfect book", it's too simplified, etc... but this book is not for you. You don't need it. It's not perfect, I admit it, but it's better than doing nothing at all, I guess you will admit this.

About Cooper Black: all the sources I checked are pointing to the lack of interest in the typeface between 1930 and 1960, and its revival in the sixties mainly due to this album cover. I couldnt find the thread you mention, I'd be happy to read it.

About Futura: you are right, I should write the 1930's. I will correct this in the next edition.

About DIN 1451: it is widely accepted that this specific variation of the DIN type system (for engineers indeed, as I wrote in my book) was mainly created for use on railways and road signs, a quick look in Google and in the articles of Albert Jan Pol will show you that - my mistake if I believed it to be true. You obviously have access to information which states the opposite, I'd like to see them.

Well, apart from a 1952 ad, honestly, I don't see exactly how you disproved the theory of "nobody, almost, used cooper black for 30 years, and suddenly, thanks to tommy steele, everybody is using it".

		<div class="commentbody">David, I looked in some 1960s Playboy magazines from before Pet Sounds in 1966, and immediately came across the Teachers Scotch campaign, among other uses of Cooper Black. If you want to form believable theories about the popularity and usage of faces, it's important to look through the mass media of an era first hand, and also consider the typographic trade practice, i.e. which fonts are being offered by print shops--if they were putting it in their specimen books, it was because it was being used.

Pet Sounds was not actually a popular album, in fact its critical acclaim is probably partly due to that. If you are looking for an influential Cooper Black album cover, this, from 1963, would be a better candidate:

<em>you focused on the mistakes without talking about the 200 other pages of reliable facts</em>

You're right, the vast majority of the book is sharply observed, for instance (just opening it at random) some nice comments about Stella and Optima.
I'm just an incorrigibly petty typographic nit-picker!
