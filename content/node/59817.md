  How can I over-ride that and place text on the whole page, by simply clicking (the
  icon for place - apple D) and without having to create a text-frame within the page
  margins?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\n\r\nGirish  "

  body: "As soon as you 'loaded' the cursor with text, you can place this text inside
    the current margins by clicking once near the top left (holding Shift will automatically
    add pages as well). But you can also create a new frame on any position you want
    by click-and-dragging the outline of the frame. If you release the mouse button
    and there is still more text to be placed, you will see a red \"out box\" at the
    bottom right of the last frame. Click on that to re-load the cursor and drag a
    new frame, where the rest of the text will flow into.\r\n\r\nOn the PC, you can
    hold Alt down to keep the cursor loaded with text after drawing a frame -- on
    your Mac it's probably the Option key. The cursor will change to reflect the new
    state."
