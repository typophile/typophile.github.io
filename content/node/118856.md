body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI am about to embark on designing a bilingual publication
  in English and Arabic. With the client we have been using Caslon for a couple of
  existing projects already however this is the first time that the project needs
  to be designed with arabic as well. Overall I am looking for an arabic typeface
  to match Caslon. From what I understand (I am an absolute novice at this) however
  this kind of matching is not necessarily always visual but more based on the specific
  cultural context of the arabic typeface is that correct?\r\n\r\nAs a westerner not
  accustomed to using arabic typefaces at all I would be interested in an arabic typeface
  that would visually (at least in it's grayness / contrast) match the Caslon I am
  otherwise using but would be interested in any opinion or advice on the matter.
  \r\n\r\nWilliam Caslon appears to have designed an arabic typeface as well - however
  I can't really discern what his interpretation was like in terms of readability
  and overall functionality as an arabic typeface - would anyone of you be familiar
  with any contemporary re-makes of his arabic type?\r\n\r\nI hope this questions
  are not in any way offensive to the visitors to this board - as I said I am very
  much a novice to this.\r\n\r\nAttached is the only image of Caslon's Arabic that
  appears to circulate the web...\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WilliamCaslon-EnglishArabic-1785

    first steps in Arabic), the Lamalif's odd shape and the dots stacked vertically
    seem very distracting.\r\n\r\nAnd couldn't find an arabic pairing for Caslon.
    Perhaps the way to go is to get someone to design the arabic for it."

  body: "Which version of Caslon are you using? Your instinct re. harmonising the
    overall colour of text is sound, although note that you may need to set the Arabic
    at a larger nominal point size than the Latin.\r\n\r\nA custom Arabic type would
    be a lovely idea, but if that's not reasonable given the budget, then I would
    go for something like Tim Holloway's <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/898/karim-family.html\">Karim</a>
    type, i.e. a fairly traditional neo-naskh style. However, you should check the
    weight, as it might be too dark for some versions of Caslon."

  body: "The style of the Arabic font to use will depend in large part on the type
    of document you are producing and its audience.\r\n\r\nCaslon Arabic, for all
    practical purposes, is not appropriate for a contemporary document. It was also
    not successful in its own time as well, due to its failure in capturing the natural
    spirit of Arabic Naskh writing of the period. Despite being a pioneering work
    in adapting Arabic to metal type, it can't be used nowadays.\r\n\r\nJohn Hudson
    is right, most Naskh fonts will be too dark when compared to most versions of
    Caslon, and that includes the font Karim he recommended. I have the font but was
    not able to typeset a text with it to compare to Caslon because it did not work
    in InDesign. Perhaps I need to check with Linotype to see if they have an updated
    version.\r\n\r\nI did however set a text for comparison using Arabic Typesetting,
    which has an excellent companion Latin designed by John Hudson, and believe that
    its color will work better than many Naskh fonts because it is already designed
    lighter in weight, and will be closer to the Latin font's color. As you can see
    in attached image, once you match the size of the Latin in Arabic Typesetting
    to Caslon, the size of the Arabic will be fairly compatible.  I included two TT
    letters at the bottom of the English text to demonstrate, one is Caslon, the other
    Arabic Typesetting.\r\n\r\nLine spacing will usually be more in Arabic compared
    with Latin text of the proper size, but if the two texts do not appear next each
    other and lines do not need to be the same, this should not be a problem. If the
    line spacing needs to be the same you may can adjust the leading so it is a little
    larger than usual in Latin, and perhaps a little tighter that usual in Arabic.\r\n\r\ndocument,
