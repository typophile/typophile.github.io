    a few interesting pieces.\r\n\r\nOn Cahuenga there was a prop warehouse for the
    movies that had a ton of neon signs on one large wall - I walked by it one night
    and it was open and all the signs were lit up - I suppose someone was there to
    pick out some props.\r\n\r\nHeavenly."

    Earth or Google Maps, where a gigantic skull sign, laid flat, stares up into space
    (and into the LandSat cameras) for your amazement. I need some other pretext to
    visit Vegas, however, I hate smoking and gambling and I like good food. '

    food now.\r\nBut the good stuff ain't cheap like them steak & shrimp deals.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    one day I'll show you something about roulette that might\r\nmake it highly enjoyable
    for you. But perhaps equally costly...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    like becoming a Stepford Wife. I recently stopped in Henderson for the night and
    wished I would have known about the \"boneyard\". I gambled and was winning but
    it can only hold my attention for about 30 minutes - I just don't get it.\r\n\r\nDiscarded
    neon signs are right up my alley."

  body: "Actually the level of quick, lucid evaluation and self-discipline required
    to beat roulette (because, unlike most any other form of gambling, it can be beat)
    is quite humbling. I've tried a few times, and always exhausted myself mentally
    (although one time the <cite>instant</cite> I quit my \"magic number\" came up!)
    It's really quite refreshing in a strange way.\r\n\r\nThe thing is though self-discipline
    is not enough: you also need a good deal of money that you're not too attached
    to - something I've never managed. But the romance of possibly beating a machine
    is worth a little bit of waste. However things like the lotto, slots, etc. are
    definitely not for me. That \"Deal or No Deal\" show makes me nauseous.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    was thinking of Reno, which I quite realize is not the same thing.\r\n\r\nI'm
    waiting for a trade show of interest. So far TypeCon has not seen fit to meet
    in Vegas.... "

    it out when I visit. Is it run like a museum or is it more literally a dump? How'd
    you arrange to take the tour? Great shots, btw."

  body: "the website is:\r\nhttp://www.neonmuseum.org/\r\n\r\nthe museum is a work
    in progress. they're actually quite ambitious with what they are trying to do
    in rescuing some of the old lighted signs that once lived on the vegas strip.
    Most of the stuff is just piled around and it's hard to get good shots of some
    of the stuff, so you hafta be creative. i think it's well worth a visit, but you
    have to try to schedule in advance as tour slots are extremely limited and fill
    up fast. you can schedule online or call, but you may need to follow up if you
    don't hear back from them, as i almost didn't get to go (again) because they didn't
    call back after we registered online."

  body: 'Oh thank you Paul for sharing your photos. So many people post shots of signs
    and neon on flickr and are apparently much more art-inclined, because they crop
    them to bits and skew the angles and all kinds of showy photo stuff that blows
    their value as documents of the letterforms. FInally a type nerd visits the boneyard!
    And there you are next to that giant pirate skull! Kudos. You even got some of
    the letterforms House used in their Vegas font set. I have to go now. '

    go and visit this place, i believe they're trying to do a good work that could
    benefit from support of folks like us.
