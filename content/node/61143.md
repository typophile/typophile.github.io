  body: "I have been away since June or so, but expect to return actively in 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nI
    was shown a source in the famous commentary on the Code of Jewish Law, regarding
    the Magen Avrahom's views on contextual placement of the shva-na.\r\n\r\nThere
    appears to be a grammatical view, based upon the Radak, with three levels of interpretation:\r\n1.
    Minchas Shai - Shai L'Morah\r\n2. Eliyahu achur - Gra - ArtScroll\r\n3. R' Zalman
    Henna or Hanau - Chabad USA\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a contextual view, based
    upon the Magen Avrahom (based upon the Radak, R' David Kimchi).\r\n\r\nApparently,
    the view of the Magen Avraham is most accurate, with the other 3 views simply
    modifying or adding to the rules of the MA.\r\n\r\nHence, automatic shva-na placement
    will be based upon the MA, with 3 alternative versions."
