But it does take a lot more time to do the research for that, and to satisfy myself that those other fonts with which I’m less familiar would do the job. Of course, I could recommend the old faithfuls, and sometimes do (e.g. Avant Garde, recently), but would prefer to keep it fresh.</p>
<p>I don’t start threads about my work, unless in the Release forum.</p>
<p>I will often illustrate topics on subjects such as small caps or ﬁgure styles with my own types. Again, I’m familiar with them and the line of thinking that went into them, and have them on hand.</p>
<p>BTW, what happened to the Featured Font?</p>

<p>To what end? The greater good of the community depends on the type industry and related industries thriving; the promotion of those people (by themselves or others) is key to that. I think there are cases where that promotion can be detrimental to a given thread or discussion but in general contributors here are intelligent and able to cope with the occasional over zealous self-promoter and call shenanigans when necessary.</div>

<li>Ghettoize the ID section. Too many bottom-feeders* with zero real interest in type, making us look cheap and shallow. If you look carefully you&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s near-zero interaction between most people who ask for and ID type, and most people who actually talk about type. And the only reason not to nuke the ID section outright is that the parasites would simply infect the other sections.</li>

<p>Chris, I don&rsquo;t think you can have a successful policy. For example, I&rsquo;d agree with Nick, he does, from time to time, promote his own products, but it is as much a service as anything else. Yet how could anyone write &ndash; and moderate &ndash;  a policy that allowed this while &ldquo;discouraging&rdquo; the prolific promoters?</p>

By my definition, I don’t consider recommending a font you designed to be self promotion, unless of course that’s all you do as a member. Another instance could be someone flagrantly posting examples of their work which don’t really bear any relevance to a thread, treating Typophile as a portfolio/job board of sorts to drum up business, without actually participating in the dialogue. This can easily be discerned by looking at a members history. The same way you can see if all someone uses Typophile for is an ID board and homework help. Obviously this is a scale, and not a black and white. You all raise good points. Thanks for your input.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s the key phrase. Someone who&rsquo;s only interested in posting spam or self-promotion typically doesn&rsquo;t get involved in discussions. But if a member who participates in discussions wants to do a bit of on-topic self-promotion, that seems fine to me.</p>

It would be nigh on pointless to do so, and even posting relevant fonts (your own) is hardly a money-making scheme. I reckon if you total up the amount of time you spend replying to &ldquo;recommend a font&rdquo; threads versus the return from recommending your own, you end up out of pocket. I honestly think the typophiles &lsquo;promoting&rsquo; their own fonts in this way are genuinely trying to help, rather than make a quick sale.</div>

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you might accept a perspective based on a wider view of human ethics:</p>
<p>Issue 1 - The Intention of a Question. To use a recent post as an example: &ldquo;Alternative to «Quiosco»&rdquo; ( <a href="http://typophile.com/node/100311">http://typophile.com/node/100311</a> ), the intention of the question was to seek out suggestions for a quite specific set of requirements (foreign language and scientific accents which are more legible for school use). This type of intention is different than someone more simply looking for an alternative to a specific typeface for the purpose of saving a bit of money, or to find something in the same genre, but slightly different. Consequently, an operational suggestion might be to provide separate forum sections for these differing intentions.</p>
<p>Issue 2 - Self-promotion in an answer. Self-promotion of a specific typeface (or in the case @hrant and the aforementioned Alternative to Quiosco post, the capacity to customize existing fonts to meet specific needs) is not necessarily a good/bad or wrong/right proposition. The ethics is: how to couch the answer? In my travels through diverse cultures and comprehensions of ethics, the effective answer might be this:</p>
<p>(a) first, make an honest effort to identify already existing alternatives as @Igor Freiberger did in attempting to provide a broad answer to the student&rsquo;s question&hellip; and certainly, list your own designs and/or preferences amongst the wider list&hellip; but do so transparently and non-aggressively&hellip; I once counseled a large computer retailer to first listen to the specific needs of a customer, and provide tailored solutions to the customer&hellip; and if, for any reason, you don&rsquo;t have the specific solution, it is wise to recommend to the customer to go somewhere else for that specific occasion (even help them to identify which retailer to visit). Customers remember this, and come back to gain &ldquo;honest&rdquo; buying suggestions. Long-term value versus short-term grab for money. A couple of the type designers that frequent Typophile, unfortunately, are just grabbing for short-term profits rather than seeing the wider, long-term value that they COULD have been providing. As a side note: from a designer&rsquo;s perspective, their designs are a true work of art (and indeed, they are). But to the user, fonts/typefaces are tools. That distinction tends to be lost when designers participate on forums such as this. An example: I personally love the pure artistry in H&amp;FJ&rsquo;s Didot&hellip; and use it whenever it is appropriate. But there are other occasions where a condensed version of a didone is required&hellip; thus, I tend to turn to Porchez&rsquo;s Ambroise (which I also admire its artistry&hellip; if didones were wives, I would have these two!)&hellip; but, alas, at the end of the day, a specific function of the typeface is required, and I make my choice based on the needs of the reader, not the type designer.</p>
<p>(b) only as last resort, should someone recommend a customization solution. How would you like to go into a computer store seeking solutions, and the salesperson, in his/her first breath says: hey, let me build you a custom computer?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; just a view from the peanut gallery&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well stated. I mostly agree, and would elaborate thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can quickly* think of an easy/affordable solution, offer it**. In the case of finding just the right font, some of us don&rsquo;t have an encyclopedic knowledge or haven&rsquo;t developed/collected search tools.</li>
<li>Recommend customization only if you think it&rsquo;s unlikely to find a good canned solution, or if it brings something extra that the requester might value (like exclusivity).</li>
<li>If you recommend yourself, also recommend that the person look to the rest of the Typophile crowd, and/or a specific expert: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/100207">http://typophile.com/node/100207</a></li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@hrant, why should it not be expected or hoped that a stranger might provide advice without expecting an immediate reward? Again, short-termism versus long-term relationships&hellip; how does one begin to build a relationship&hellip; only when there is a reward attached? I say this not merely from an ethical/spiritual perspective, but also from a practical perspective. The relationships that I am fortunate to have now, are most often as a result of many years ago providing counsel or just an ear/shoulder to someone in need&hellip; this is the human factor that I find missing in &ldquo;western&rdquo; culture, but is the core of socio-economic relationships in other parts of the world&hellip; there is a slippery slope component to your ethical judgements: it is predicated on &ldquo;consequence&rdquo; ethics, rather than ethical judgement based on &ldquo;natural truth&rdquo; as Immanuel Kant was trying to explore&hellip; if we truly love one another, then the relationships we develop (including economic relationships) will be much more than fruitful&hellip; they will be eternal in their power&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re a recent arrival, so you don&rsquo;t realize that I agree with you. :-)  In fact I&rsquo;ve been helping people on Typophile for over 12 years now, generally with little hope of material reward. I guess the operative words in what I wrote are &ldquo;stranger&rdquo;, &ldquo;hours&rdquo; and most of all, &ldquo;expect&rdquo;. I just think it&rsquo;s unreasonable for somebody to pop up, ask for help on a difficult problem, and <em>expect</em> everybody to devote hours helping him.
