  for a start-up title called 'Status', it's targeted at the 'Exclusive, Rich, Powerful,
  Sexy and Sophisticated' or at least that's the strap line they've given me!!\r\n\r\nAll
  the sophisticated faces I've tried have a bit too much going on (think meta) for
  a logotype.\r\n\r\nSo I'm spreading the net, any thoughts of something fresh, beautifully
  cut, stylish and fashionable? I'm tending towards a sans as the serifs tend to be
  too fussy but am open minded.\r\n\r\nthanks__"
