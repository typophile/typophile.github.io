  Contemporary or \"ambiguous\" are all I can come up with. I'm working on list, and
  have not used \"contemporary\" yet, and don't want to. \"Ambiguous\" would not really
  be a classification, but more a lack thereof. \r\n\r\nHow 'bout: Blurry Neo-Grotesque?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: You have "neo" bracketed. If it's based on Helvetica, it would formally be
    neo-grotesque, correct?

    to inflate the perceived importance of 1950s/60s modernism, aka Swiss modernism
    or the International Style. But none of the original neo-grotesque families really
    does anything new stylistically; regimented grots/gothics with horizontal terminals
    date back to the nineteenth century and ATF had produced excellent examples in
    the early twentieth. The careful planning of the entire Univers family is really
    the important feature of the neo-grotesques and is not a stylistic feature. For
    the sake of honest design history the entire notion of the neo-grotesque category
    needs to be swept into the gutter."

    such as outline and shaded, are not classed as different typefaces, so why should
    blurred/rounded be?\r\n\r\nNeville Brody originally created this style by sandwiching
    sheets of clear acetate between negative type image and positive film, for an
    out-of-focus contact print. That's mentioned in the <em>Graphic Language</em>
    book."

    thing I've read so far about this. In a sense then, you can't really produce a
    new neo-grotesque. It seems like the term was the \"contemporary\" classification
    of the 50's-60's for sans-serif designs, and now makes much less sense 50 years
    later. If it's not a formally differentiated style, then \"neo\" is really anachronistic,
    correct?"

    the International Style is (slowly) becoming an anachronism."

  body: "Distressing is a category of style (bold and italic are others) which  may
    be applied to many traditional categories of type.\r\n\r\nFontShop lists eight
    cross-categories of \"Distressed\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps if it is done with a generic
    provenance (such as Blur), the result may be considered a new typeface, rather
    than a variant of an existing one (e.g. Metallophile, clearly a Futura family
    member).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
