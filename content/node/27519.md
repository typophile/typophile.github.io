body: "So I'm doing a last minute small run of biz cards for Typecon as I've just
  registered a domain that will point to my new portfolio site: http://www.dsinelab.net/dave/index.html
  (temp location) I'm trying to keep the site, resume and biz cards of the same family
  so they feel cohesive but I don't know what to do about the card. Here is what I
  have so far...hopefully there's still a few people who aren't on their way to Boston.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/db_4431.bizcard.1.png]"

  body: "You use oldstyle figures for your telephone number\u2026 how about lowercase
    for the URL and e-mail address. The Internet is lowercase anyway and it matches
    the numbers better\u2026 plus you'll be able to read it to boot!\r\n\r\nThe \"GRAPHIC
    DESIGNER\" can stay uppercase, since that matches your stuff on your site."

  body: Letterspace all your capital letters and numbers at the lower right. They
    are hard to read right now. If they are full caps (and you are in Illustrator)
    try setting tracking to 100 and work down from there. If they are small caps,
    start at 50 and work up. Also the type at the lower right is too big. If you are
    printing litho, you can go as small as 5 pt with that kind of slabby serif in
    all caps. 7 pt is probably more realistic. It will add some depth to the card.

    Dan's comments. The CAP-height overpowers the non-lining numerals.\r\n\r\nIs the
    black border going to print?? Or are you just showing me the edges of the card?
    Trimming out a border that thin will cause headaches."

  body: "well it looks a bit boring imo. The logotype is the only thing that stands
    out and it doesn't match the look and feel of the rest of the card. Also why not
    adding some colour? or some logomark, or something to show people that you are
    a designer. Right now that card could be for dumbo the clown or Jane the interior
    designer, nothing says \"graphic design\" to me. \r\n\r\nAre yout printing on
    white stock? Did you leave enough extra black around the border so that if your
    cutting is off it is still a full black border?"

    either.

  body: Nothing wrong with gray, but a bold color might have more impact. Like the
    lowercase, but think the lower right type could be even smaller and url and email
    letterspaced a bit. I also agree about the rule; don't think it's necessary. Also,
    the leading looks a bit tight and uneven to me. The oldstyle figures provide more
    space above than the line above.

    try a version sans border.

  body: Thanks for the replies everyone. Concerning the weird spacing lower right...that's
    just a product of the fact it's a screenshot. I've already printed/trimmed about
    100 and passed a good deal out at TypeCon this weekend. I'll come back to this
    thread when I need to print more.
