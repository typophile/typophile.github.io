  body: "Need more information about your intentions for the logo, what service do
    you offer your demographic etc.\r\nThat said I like the crown but I don't see
    why the \"co\" should have a 3d effect nor why it should have a different light
    source than the crown or the mix of faces.\r\nTim"

  body: 'Co., has as Tim said, has much to much emphsis. The crown doesn''t mean anything
    but who cares. I think the type is to tight. Especially the CTU in picture. Did
    you investigate Caps and Small Caps, everything feels heavy. Lastly, the name
    isn''t memorable '

  body: "I like the crown and the 'co', but in the context of 'Schreiber Picture'
    they feel odd and out of place. The name and the 'co' are going in opposite directions
    right now. Honestly, I'd push the name in the more ornate direction, to make it
    more memorable and unique. If you stick with the sans serif, I don't like the
    noisy outlines on 'Schreiber PIcture' and I agree with Dan that it's too tight.
    Go smaller and more loose. That may solve the problem.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does
    the company do?\r\n\r\nAlso, how does this logo work on a white background? Or
    is the black box part of the logo?"
