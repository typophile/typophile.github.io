  what appears in the following image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hebrew_5710.gif]\r\n\r\nAs
  a web designer primarily, the only way I can describe this is that I want the Hebrew
  word to \"Float Right\" immediately preceding (or inside) the English paragraph
  comprising the Hebrew word's definition.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to assign this
  as a paragraph or character style inside InDesign (CS2 Middle Eastern)? Thanks!"

  body: "<cite>Does the MS Word doc encode the Hebrew characters right-to-left?</cite>\r\n\r\n(Sure
    it does. Word even has no problems at all with Arabic and its initial/medial/finals.)\r\n\r\n(Post-edit:
    \"encoding\" ... the text appears left-to-right in the actual file, and that's
    what InDesign/Regular reads and shows. It's <em>also</em> what InDesign/ME reads,
    but that shows it correctly.)\r\n\r\n<cite>How averse are you to moving to CS3?</cite>\r\n\r\nIf
    I was the OP, I'd go down kicking and screaming.\r\nSure, CS3 has a few advantages
    over CS2 -- it's significantly faster, and its GREP Search and Replace has some
    fantastic applications. But, like CS2, it has <strong>no</strong> support at all
    for RTL languages. It will import the Word document just fine, but without warning
    it will load all text left to right, thus \"gnisrever\" the RTL text. The ME version
    has it all.\r\n\r\nNo anchored frames because of\r\n<cite>thousands of entries,
    and each will be imported from Word text.</cite>\r\nwouldn't worry me in the least.
    If these words always appear at the same place, for instance as a heading before
    the actual definition paragraph, it's well worth the effort writing a script that
    cuts the word, inserts an anchored object, and pastes the word inside it. Thing
    is, anchored objects do not like text wrap, and reverse. I think there are solutions
    to this; perhaps you'd better ask in the [[http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bbf275c/|InDesign
    User's forum]]. Whatever the solution is, scripting is the way to go."

  body: "Adobe InDesign CS/3 ME (Middle East edition, for Middle Eastern languages,
    such as Arabic, Hebrew and Persian [Urdu]) is a very intelligent program which
    handles mixing both left-to-right languages, such as English or Russian, together
    with right-to-left languages, such as Arabic or Hebrew, in an intelligent way.\r\n\r\nThe
    combination can either be for a left-to-right language (in which the arrow indicator
    in the character palette should be on the left side, pointing right (see the character
    palette), or be for a right-to-left language (in which the arrow indicator in
    the character palette should be on the right side, pointing left (see the character
    palette), or side by side, with each language in its own text block.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the two languages are side-by-side in separate text boxes, consider carefully
    the best side to place the boxes.\r\n\r\nAs a professional typesetter, I suggest
    to place the left-to-right language on the left side, and the right-to-left language
    on the right side. \r\n\r\nThis decision is based upon the graphic arts concept
    of \"eye movement\". When the left-to-right language is on the left side, the
    left-to-right language reader simply places his or her eye naturally on the left
    side. So, too, when the a right-to-left language is on the right side, the right-to-left
    language reader simply places his or her eye naturally on the right side. \r\n\r\nIf
    the right-to-left language is Hebrew, the size of the font and the line spacing
    is not simply automatic.\r\n\r\nThis is because Hebrew text translates into much
    more words in Western languages, such as English. Thus, if the font size and line
    spacing remains the same in both languages, the Hebrew side will take up far less
    lines than English. If you desire this kind if result, fine. If, however, you
    desire to each text block to be filled with lines equally, you have three choices:\r\n1)
    to keep the same line spacing, but to increase the font size for the Hebrew;\r\n2)
    to keep the sane font size, but to increase the line spacing for the Hebrew;\r\n3)
    to increase both the line spacing, and the font size.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration
    is that Hebrew letters look much too big if they match the size of uppercase English
    letters. Yet, if they match the size of lowercase English letters, the Hebrew
    letters look much too small.\r\n\r\nI think the correct way to match side-by-side
    languages is to weigh the \"color\" look of the page as a whole. This means, each
    side has a certain \"color\" of the amount of black ink and white empty space.
    The best font size and line spacing for the Hebrew is a proper \"color balance\".\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    the font should not be increased too much for the Hebrew to cause ot to look too
    \"holey\" or \"spacey\". On the other hand, the line spacing should not be increased
    too much to cause the Hebrew letters to look too small in comparison to the English
    text, or to have too much space between the lines.\r\n\r\nOf course, since the
    right-to-left language determines the page count, it should be laid out first,
    and the left-to-right language should follow later."

  body: "I forgot to mention that if you choose to use Adobe InDesign CS/3 ME, you
    will need up-to-date Hebrew fonts with Unicode encoding. Older Hebrew fonts, including
    some TrueType Hebrew fonts, will not work.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to use Adobe InDesign
    CS/3 in its US or Western European version, then you could use older Hebrew fonts.\r\n\r\nYou
    might be able to position the Hebrew words as embedded or anchored graphics. However,
    before you make the graphic, you will have cause the Hebrew text to be lowered
    a little, so the baseline of the English text lines up with th Hebrew word. Also,
    you will have to key in the Hebrew letters in backwards order, or hit the left
    arrow key after entering the Hebrew letters in correct order.\r\n\r\nI syuggest
    to mix the languages in the proper way, and use Adobe InDesign CS/3 ME.\r\n\r\nYou
    can contact FontWorld (at www.fontworld.com), for very good sales and free technical

  body: You can do this with anchored text boxes very easily. You will probably want
    to script this and do it in CS4 since there is a bug in CS3 which will cause you
    problems but not unsurmountable. GoHebrew is correct in that the direction is
    odd. The Hebrew should be on the left of the English paragraph, but of course
    that is an editorial decision.

    This project is a revision of the classic Jastrow Aramaic-English Talmud dictionary
