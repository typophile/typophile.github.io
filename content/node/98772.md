  body: "Sorry, it's not blurry enough. I can still almost see the New York Jets'
    Logo.  As is your question. You ask about \"The Typeface used ... \" when there
    are at least four different faces whose existence is hinted at by the fog.\r\n\r\n
    The Hoefler/Frere-Jones  foundry created the proprietary font used for the Jets
    logo, remarkably named \"JetsBold\".\r\n\r\n- Herb"

    body: 'Hey Herb. Thanks for the reply. Think you didn''t scroll to the right.
      Didn''t mean the ones blurry in the background. Only the clear one in the foreground.
      The image was a bit too big. '

  body: "I'm sure he was speaking of the non-blurry letters, and the first response
    was just chiding him in jest for not being specific.\r\n\r\nAs for the OP's comment,
    I feel no need to judge Tim Tebow for his personal faith.\r\n\r\nI might judge
    Katy Perry's relatives for suggesting him to her as a possible marriage partner,
    after her marriage to Russell Brand broke up over him wanting her to abandon her
    career to have kids - she would naturally fear that a man of such demonstrative
    faith would also have traditional attitudes to a woman's role - but that's their
    problem, not his."
