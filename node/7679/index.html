<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Heres a project i have been working on. I want to come up with three strong comps for the client. I already favor one but wanted to get your imput. <br> <br>Quantum is a little different than most construction company's. They are experienced in German Craftmanship and use ecological building techniques.(not on every job) <br> <br>Regardless heres what I have so far. I could play with the square for days. I havent picked a font and the client said he is willing to purchase any that would fit right so any suggestion are helpful. I just layed it out in frutiger to make the most legible type for now. I put construction smaller because it just seemd to work better that way, since its in all caps i spaced out the lettering to make it more legible. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53513.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Gregory, ask yourself this question. Is the word Construction as important as the name Quantum? If not make it alot smaller and tuck it under Quantum. <br> <br>On the mark try making the black area in perspective. Move the point of the lower left of the black in towards the center. Move the point of the lower right towards the center, just a little.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think I like your bottom-right design in post 34 better than these later posts. The 3-D effect is distracting from the "Q-C" combo that creates the mark. <br> <br>As Daniel described, tuck that "Construction" underneath "Quantum" as you did in earlier posts. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gregory, why is all the type so heavy? The only type I would make that bold is Quantum. Construction is far too important and because everything is bold nothing stands out. The forced justifcation isn't working the gap between the License# and the number is terrible. Also you forgot the zip code. The gaps in the other lines aren't much better. Make the type flush left, rag right, use a lighter weight on the information and fix the spacing. I would also look at a different face for the clients name, its too imposing. Sorry, but thats how I see it. Its not a reflection on you or your talent.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gregory, just open the PMS swatches in the program you are using, but even better would be to go to an art store and buy a PMS swatch book. They are expensive but worth it. <br>The terms Steel gray and Granite gray are just directions not specific colors. <br>Did you investigate a horitonzal version of the business card? Also think about embossing the mark. It could be a tinted emboss it would screem construction without saying a thing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It looks like I'm in the minority but I'm not wild for the rubik's cube/electric plugs logo mark. As others mentioned it seems to convey pre-fab more than quality construction. And the QC connection in the mark is strongest where the leters interlock which also looks confusing because then one of the letters is on it's side. Not until I started typing this did I see the right reading QC relationship. But because one's eye is drawn to the tension of the interlock, it's harder to see the QC next to each other. (I hope I explained that clearly.) <br> <br>Since you are planning on showing three concepts to your client, I suggest re-visiting your first logo. I liked the simplicity of the form (but not the rounded font you selected) and the centers made me think of screwdrivers. Which in turn makes me think of fine hand craftsmanship. In reality hand tools are probably so infrequently used in construction these days but I think the symbolism is timeless. <br> <br>I'm attaching a down and dirty sketch. My thoughts were that the mark should look built and organic at the same time. My version may have too much of a ying/yang feel to convey German Craftsmanship. I just wanted to illustrate that your initial sketch has other possibilities. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55112.jpg alt="QC logo test"> <br> <br>I also like the basketweave line that you incorporated onto the business card, but I don't like it with the cube logo. Perhaps it should be used on it's own with a clean type treatment. <br> <br>Keep posting.</div>

<div class=commentbody>HI guys! <br>im in the "Cube logo fun club" <br>no 3D - that loosens its very strong visual power. (well.. to me.) <br> <br>and the house in green made of bamboo, is not german or precise craftman like to me. <br> <br>and the first QC version gives me the idea of (+) and (-) signs, which is like this next to eachother are like battery rechargers signs... nahhh.... <br> <br>but the blocky one is wonderful. house blocks attached 2 eachoder - veryproper. dont mess up the good concept with too much lines. (including 3D, or strong outline or so...) simply use some green in the first version... (i liked that a lot) <br> <br>but just to show u that u r confusing, Post nr 43 is very nice suprice as well.. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>....search in progress.... <br> <br>chill, gregory.</div>

<div class=commentbody>hey all thanks for the suggestions. <br> <br>Daniel i like the way you think. An emboss would be awesome. It would give the card a three dimensional feel. <br> <br>Do you know any homemade techniques to do this? I would like to test if first to see if it works for the project? <br> <br> I went to Kelley Paper picked out some stock and printed some stuff and I will post them. This process has been fun. <br> <br>Kristen: I agree I think that I could explore older options. Iam open to anything new. I like your exploration of the logo.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gregory, there is only one way to simulate the emboss that is to pain stakinly cut a piece of the same paper and paste it on a flat piece of stock. I've done it before myself. It takes time but is worth it.</div>
