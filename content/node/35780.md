  Runen, Wilhelm Carl Grimm, G\xF6ttingen, 1821). The shape of the umlaut caught my
  eye, but I paid no further attention. Today I visited someone who had a piece of
  furniture with type on it. This cupboard is made in 1855 and the type used seemed
  familiar. Indeed, it featured the same kind of e-shaped umlaut on top of the 'a'.\r\nWhere
  does this kind of umlaut come from and why is it replaced by the 'dots'?\r\nArjen[img:sites/default/files/old-images/umlaut-e_6235.jpg]"

    on Umlauts</a> that describes the possible evolution of ae > \xE6 > a with superscript
    e written in some kind of German script [see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin\">S\xFCtterlin</a>]
    > \xE4.\r\nOf course, there may be other explanations to the same phenomenon,
    e.g. the e getting smaller and smaller in medieval script or the like. \r\nThese
    Umlauts were quite common in Fraktur types of all origins, also up to the 1930s
    (though not necessarily in all blackletter types). \r\nMy example is from J.J.
    David, Gesammelte Werke, M\xFCnchen und Leipzig R. Piper u. Co., 1908:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/umlauts_5486.jpg]\r\nProbably
    you'll find out the printer of the \"Dieterichs Buchhandlung\" in G\xF6ttingen
    around the time of publication, or you start looking for other books published
    in the 1820s. Maybe you can get closer to your \"what's the typeface\" answer
    that way\u2026\r\nGood luck, Stephan"

    for the little 'e' shaped umlautt! In Seutterlinschrift the shape over the 'u'
    to distinguish it from the 'n' and 'm' (lower case) is a harken and it is like
    a slightly exaggerated comma.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the little 'e' shape it seems
    to me that it might have originated in the handwritten form as most of these things
    are.\r\n\r\nA little comma is interesting in that a daub with the nib of the quill
    would create a dolop of ink from which to pull the tail of the comma but if the
    nib was cut for square pen scripts then the ink might not readily flow and so
    would need a lead-in stroke/serif to initiate the flow of ink. If you start with
    the internal cross bar of the 'e' this then up and over, around and down would
    quite happily create an 'e-like' shape.\r\n\r\nThe existence of 2 'horns' on this
    like of 'e' could then lead to some interchange with 2 dots as the horns would
    look like 2 dots! But this mainly in the formal Fraktur and not the more rounded
    Schwabacher!\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "Paul, \r\nwhile it seems possible from a graphic/chirographic point of view,
    I don\u2019t think that your idea is of any relevance due to the <em>linguistic</em>
    necessities of the German language. \r\nIn Suetterlin (and of course, also in
    earlier instances of \"German\" Kurrent handwriting systems \u2013 your argument
    would also be historically out of place as Suetterlin was a creation of the 20th
    century whereas the first printed Fraktur types with this kind of e-shaped umlaut
    may date from as early as the 15th century) any u is written with this small mark,
    and any umlaut is written with two small dots or strokes. There is no connection
    between the two strokes, and if there were one because of casual writing, any
    reader would easily discern whether \xFC or u were denoted depending on vocabulary
    and therefore context of the letter. The same would apply if one wrote a Suetterlin
    u with a e-shaped u-mark as you suggest. \r\nTo sum up: My main concern with your
    idea is that an u is not an \xFC. "

  body: if i'm not mistaken, the two-dot umlaut derives from the script form of the
    german e. see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_%28diacritic%29">English

  body: "Paul, I presume you refer to this part:\r\n<cite>Originally, phonological
    umlaut was denoted in written German by adding an e to the affected vowel, either
    after the vowel or, in small form, above it. (In medieval German manuscripts,
    other digraphs could also be written using superscripts: in bluome (\"flower\"),
    for example, the &lt;o&gt; was frequently placed above the &lt;u&gt;.) In blackletter
    handwriting as used in German manuscripts of the later Middle Ages, and also in
    many printed texts of the early modern period, the superscript \t&lt;e> still
    had a form which would be recognisable to us as an &lt;e&gt;. However, in the
    forms of handwriting which emerged in the early modern period (of which S\xFCtterlin
    is the latest and best known example), the letter &lt;e&gt; had two strong vertical
    lines, and the superscript &lt;e&gt; looked like two tiny strokes. Gradually these
    strokes were reduced to dots, and as early as the 16th century we find this handwritten
    convention being transferred sporadically to printed texts too. </cite>\r\n\r\nTo
    me it makes absolutely sense that a \"superscript-e\" was used to express a change
    in pronunciation. Especially because a similair \"sound\" is written as \xE6 in
    Danish. Could there be any relation between those two glyphs?"

  body: "Yes, that makes sense. \xE4 and \xE6 have something in common, both show
    some kind of combination of a and e. But this does not necessarily have anything
    to do with them denoting similar sounds (although they are indeed similar in German
    '\xE4' and Danish '\xE6'. \r\nAlso, there are different ways of describing sounds
    (most commonly, the IPA is used, see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-sized_IPA_vowel_chart|Wikipedia:
    IPA vowel chart]]. \r\nMoreover, on the German keyboard layout on the Mac, \xE4
    and \xE6 are positioned on the same key, only \xE6 can be accessed with the alt
    modifier key, so they must have something in common ;-)"

  body: "Just for the record, the primary/initial/original form of the umlaut was
    the superscript e. In the inital years of German print, both in fraktur and antiqua
    you'll find it solely. In print however it was replaced by double dots pretty
    soon. The latest you could find O WITH SUPERSCRIPT E for umlaut in Antiqua would
    be (cca.) early to mid 18th century.\r\n\r\nThe argument of S\xFCtterlin is really
    highly anachronistic, though similar mechanisms might have influenced the coice
    of diacritic when replacing superscript e."

  body: "This excerpt: \r\n\r\nThe typographers who created the Schwabacher font in
    1481 picked up this style and included a small \u201Ce\u201D above their vowels
    in the type case. This simplified into a little open \u201Co\u201D in some font
    designs. The double dot likely originated from a long script \u201Ce\u201D that
    looked like two loops in handwriting and eventually became the standard symbol
    for the umlaut.\r\n\r\nfrom:\r\n\r\nhttp://clicknation.com/snoof/stuff/umlaut.pdf"

  body: "Another excerpt from the link above:\r\n\r\nEnglish is promiscuous in its
    pronunciations: the classic \u201Ctough, cough, bough, though, through\u201D with
    its variations of silent letters and dipthongs. Germanic languages are much more
    regular. The umlaut properly speaking is a sound, as well as the symbol for the
    sound. The umlaut (literally \u201Caround sound\u201D) is a vowel that is pronounced
    differently because once upon a time it was followed by another vowel. The old
    vowel no longer appears in the word, but it still affects the remaining vowel.
    This process is also called vowel mutation. So the sound caused by ai, oi and
    ui mutated into umlaut \xE4, \xF6, and \xFC, alternatively written as ae, oe,
    and ue. A German example is the word mann (man in English), pronounced like \u201Cmahn,\u201D
    becoming the plural m\xE4nner (men), pronounced much closer to \u201Cmainer.\u201D
    English has some Teutonic roots through Anglo-Saxon and the umlaut mutation explains
    how the plural of mouse is mice, tooth is teeth and goose is geese."
