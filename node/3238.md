  It a handlettered serif with gravy on top. The glyphs were drawn at 1cm high and
  digitized. There are some color issues with the smallcaps, but overall I was pleasantly
  surprised by the nice texture. If you can think of other fun addition to the set
  I&#39;d love to extend it. It kinda reminds me of emigre&#39;s journal with a bit

    to rotate and/or skew most of the glyphs slightly to make it more upright.

    people have accused me of being left handed after looking at my handrawn work.
    I&#39;m not sure where the backslanting comes from. I will go through and rework
    the regular lc. There are also baseline/x-height issues in the italic to be addressed.  <BR>
    <BR>I was thinking a bit about doing a clean version &#40;digitally remastered&#41;
    keeping the funky quality, but with smooth curves. It would be included in the
    set. Thoughts on that? Or other comments? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Randy

    thread isn&#39;t really the proper forum for this topic, I will mention that we
    are adding more text faces to balance out the collection as we speak. For instance,
    a full blown OpenType version of Christian Robertson&#39;s long anticipated <a
    href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/156.html">Pill Gothic</a> will
    be coming out as part of Umbrella next month.'

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll let everyone know as soon as it&#39;s available in
    our system. Which will probably be before the end of May. The fact is... Randy&#39;s
    little disc of golden master love only dropped onto my desk yesterday. We still
    need to run the typeface through the <a href="http://www.veer.com/">Veer Supa

    - hence the Provo address. Head office is in Calgary, Alberta. We do have a shingle
    hanging in NYC now though...

  body: "Hi Polly,\r\n\r\nJust saw your post, but since you have a license it may
    yet be useful:\r\n\r\nShort answer: I cheated!\r\n\r\nLong answer: I made a flat
    banner using the ends and middle. Then arched the whole thing using Adobe Illustrator's
    envelope feature. After, I added the text along the path. So you're not missing
    the super secret arched version, you have to make it. I couldn't figure out how
    to make an arched version as a font since the amount of arch would depend on how
    long the text was. Anyhow, glad to hear you're enjoying Olduvai."
