  think of good fonts to pair with Bank Gothic that I can use for body text? I'm currently
  using Gotham for body text. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTal"

  body: "This is going to sound monotonous to some of the regulars here. Perhaps something
    for the FAQ:\r\n\r\nMany different typefaces will work with Bank Gothic. To narrow
    down the list it would be best to know more about your project. What is the message
    of the organization? Who is its audience? These are the first questions you should
    ask <em>before</em> you think about pairings."

  body: 'Thanks Stephen. The client, a photographer, wants to send his work out to
    several top-tier magazines and newspapers. He wants to look strong, ballsy, and
    unique in his vision. His photographs are a social commentary based on images
    of luxury goods and high fashion. '

  body: "Great brief. Thanks. Gotham seems okay for this, but it has the drawback
    of being overexposed right now. So if he wants to be unique, best use unique type.\r\n\r\nBank
    Gothic has a vintage pedigree, but you can make it live comfortably in a modern
    design if you want. Suggestions in that vein:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Amplitude%20-purchase\">Amplitude</a>\r\n<a

  body: Thanks, Stephen. I'll try those out. I do like the slabs of Caecilia off the
    bat. What criteria did you use to suggest these typefaces as pairs to Bank Gothic?

    which might be ideal for this, but no italics.\r\n\r\nI think Caecilia is your
    best bet."
