  body: You mean like a slab serif -- Memphis or something like that? <BR> <BR>Biggest
    serifs I know of were in 1960s San Francisco psychedelic poster lettering. <BR>
    <BR>Nothing like Bodoni or Waters though.

  body: When I read your question I wasn&#39;t thinking about thick serifs, I was
    thinking thin and long. My suggestions are Carol Twombly&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/charlemagne/"
    target="_blank">&#39;Charlemagne&#39;</a>,  or Xavier Dupre&#39;s new one for
    Font Font called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/angkoon/" target="_blank">&#39;Angkoon&#39;</a>

  body: You could also look at Ablefont. I can&#39;t find a showing for this but when
    I googled it I learned that it was used for Harry Potter. It&#39;s a variation
    on Charlemagne but less regular.

  body: I know a typeface with such long serifs the <a href="http://lucasfonts.com/"
    target="_blank"> designer</a> had to <a href="http://lucasfonts.com/lucasfnt/punten/punten-.html"
    target="_blank"> bend</a>  <BR>them inwards in order to make the characters fit
    next to each other. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
