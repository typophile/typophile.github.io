body: I know this has been brought up before with some response, but it never seems
  to go anywhere. So I&#39;ll ask again ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Is there anything we can
  do to fix the fact that if one posts a wide image it completely messes up the entire
  layout of the thread with extremely-wide-impossible-to-read line lengths? <BR> <BR>It
  seems the easy solution would be to wrap each comment in it&#39;s own table and/or
  div instead of putting them all in one containing table. <BR> <BR>Just a thought.
  It&#39;d sure make reading some threads a lot easier.

  body: the problem with wrapping manually is that it produces clumsy markup/content
    stored in the database. Not a huge deal, but it&#39;s something to consider. Plus,
    it&#39;s more work for the people posting, not to mention that everyone has their
    own preferred line-lenght ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>As for volunteers, send the templates

    will still maintain the page width, but Safari doesn&#39;t. What do you think?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>I think that&#39;s simply too wide for comfortable reading lengths for
    a lot of people. Plus, I normally browser with my window at roughtly 5/600 pixels
    wide. I think the problem is how the template is spit out. <BR> <BR>The code is
    also INCREDIBLY messy, redundant and bloated with all sorts of font tags and such.
    On this page, I see 16 closing font tags in a row &#40;yikes!&#41;: <BR> <BR>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;
    <BR> <BR>The problem is that the entire thread is in one table that is nested
    in another table. Each comment in the thread is a TR of the parent, so whatever
    the parent table&#39;s width is, each comment will be that width. <BR> <BR>If
    you want to stick with tables, the fix &#40;I think&#41; is to get rid of the
    wrapper table and then allow each comment in the thread be it&#39;s own table,
    with a percentage width. <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t an uncommon problem with these
    types of forums that were built in the hey-day of &#39;let&#39;s do everything
    with a ton of tables&#39; and it&#39;s really only a problem here due to the fact
    that we post rather large images. <BR> <BR>&#34;Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif at

  body: 200 DPI and 4 POINT TEXT <BR>John, are you suggesting that the problem could
    be fixed by  <BR>specifying points rather than pixels in the style sheet? <BR>
    <BR>In my experience, pixels render truer across platforms than  <BR>points &#40;given
    the Windows 96dpi and Mac at 72dpi&#41;. I can&#39;t  <BR>explain the math, but
    in testing many sites, they look more  <BR>consistent across platforms by speccing
    pixels. I will  <BR>concede that the testing I&#39;ve done has always involved  <BR>common
    laptop and CRT screens. &#40;I wish I had the problems  <BR>associated with a
    $7,500 screen.&#41; <BR> <BR>NOT A VERDANA FAN? <BR>Not <i>always</i> a Verdana
    fan, no. Verdana is brilliant at 9 to  <BR>11 point, aliased. It also maintains
    bold at 9 and 10 pt <BR>&#40;Helvetica/Arial at 10 pt on the Mac do not&#41;.
    However when  <BR>the new OSs anti-alias all the text, and when text must be  <BR>larger,
    especially at 14 or 16 point, it&#39;s clunky. &#40;And I don&#39;t  <BR>think
    I&#39;m blaspheming when I suggest it doesn&#39;t perform  <BR>optimally at larger
    sizes.&#41; Aside from that, we know a great type <BR>blog that uses Verdana and
    we wanted to differentiate  <BR>ourselves. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>MESSY CODE <BR>Darrel,
    you&#39;re right. The messy code and the lack of control <BR>&#40;over line widths,
    layout, et cetera&#41; is the danger of using a  <BR>canned product instead of
    building something from scratch.  <BR>I&#39;m sure what you&#39;re pointing out
    contributes to slowness  <BR>that some people notice. We&#39;ve looked at other
    discussion  <BR>forum software &#40;which is not the same as blog software&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The danger of moving to another discussion platform is that <BR>we potentially
    lose convenient access to the past 2 years of  <BR>content generated by this community.
    Although we certainly  <BR>haven&#39;t ruled that out. &#40;If we installed new
    forum software we&#39;d <BR>certainly make the old one available to search and
    read.&#41;

  body: 'Joseph, spec&#39;ing type in pts or another resolution-independent measure
    is certainly the best idea. Yes, the results are going to vary across platforms,
    but they are not going to vary as greatly as fixed size pixel type across different
    resolutions. Personally, I think type size should not be spec&#39;d at all, except
    as relative to body type, but should be determined by the user-side preferences,
    and all other measurements, e.g. text block width, should be spec&#39;d in ems
    so that these too are relative to the body type. That way you have perfectly scaleable
    web pages. <BR> <BR>Above, Darrel says that he thinks 780 pixels is &#39;simply
    too wide for comfortable reading lengths for a lot of people&#39;, but this observation
    is itself based on the assumption that the type is spec&#39;d in pixels. If the
    type were spec&#39;d in pts, then the number of words a on 780 pixel measure would
    depend on the resolution: it would probably be a bit narrow for comfort on my
    screen. But if the type were spec&#39;d as pts and the measure spec&#39;d in ems,
    then the number of words on a line would be the same regardless of the resolution.'
