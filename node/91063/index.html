  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am proposing my thesis topic and could do with some feedback. My aim in the thesis is to critically look at typography in print and on screen, and examine the differences between them focusing on legibility and readability, and perhaps transferring a piece of visual communication in print to screen and see if it captures the viewer the same or creates a completely different feel. I am looking for as much information on the topic and to find professionals who may have applied theories to either print typography or on screen typography. I think it is fairly new topic with the rapid emergence of new technologies and how type can be treated on screen - kinetic type, 3 dimensional etc.
So if anyone has some opinions or links I can research, I&rsquo;d really appreciate it.</div>

<p>You asked for opinion: The primary differences are 1) resolution and 2) light source.</p>
<p>As for 1) that&rsquo;s slowly but surely becoming irrelevant (e-ink, retina/high-density iOS devices, etc). As for 2) still a primary difference (reflective vs. projected light) though, again, e-ink is making that a bit less of an issue.</p>

I knew it was so broad but wasn&rsquo;t sure how to narrow it to something that was interesting and could be supported by theories.

Thanks also the links those who posted them

than a sophistication) that Verdana sort of matches. I think a
bigger problem than the font chosen was that it was in effect a
technical cop out, and <em>right when</em> webfonts were taking off!
They thought it would save them money, but resorting to a
pedestrian solution loses you money in the long term.</p>

<p>Look at the &ldquo;N&rdquo;, third line from the bottom. If that &ldquo;N&rdquo;
is large enough to read comfortably, it&rsquo;s also messed up
to the naked eye. So if you&rsquo;re going to render like a slob,
you need <em>much</em> higher resolution. You can get away with
coarser (I mean ~300) resolution if you&rsquo;re mindful of how
the pixels lay down. You can&rsquo;t have both, no matter how
many laymen (and rosy-eyed non-laymen) you fool.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For an example of the difference between print and screen typography, consider Ikea’s change of corporate typeface from Futura to Verdana.</p>
<p>Verdana is brilliant on screen, for which it was designed, but lacks sophistication in print, which is unfortunate for a design business like Ikea.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of items that will give you a good idea of how designers can dislike a face in print (to the extent of it being the butt of an April Fool’s joke), which has long been extolled on screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://idsgn.org/posts/verdana-and-georgia-grow-up/">http://idsgn.org/posts/verdana-and-georgia-grow-up/</a>
<a href="http://idsgn.org/posts/apple-switches-to-verdana/">http://idsgn.org/posts/apple-switches-to-verdana/</a></p>
<p>More typically, the issue of screen/print portability is framed the other way around, with the main culprits being faces which have excelled for centuries in print having difficulty adjusting to pixellation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So I finally got a chance to check out an iPad3,
and even with my 20/15 vision I was impressed.
Although I can detect a bit of strangeness in the
text rendering, since I don&rsquo;t expect most people
to curl up with it for hours and read a book* I have
to think it must be good enough. The fact that there&rsquo;s
a lot of real-estate means you can hold it at a decent
distance** and that makes the resolution effectively
much higher. So I&rsquo;m guessing that for a large device,
above 250dpi is good enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>The emissive nature of the screen is
still an obstacle I think. In contrast
e-ink is much kinder.</li>
</ul>
<p>** In fact the notable weight means you
have to rest it somewhere soon enough.</p>
<p>There are other large devices with high resolution
already on the market, but my question now is: are
there any good analyses of when most people will
start seeing such screens in front of them most of
the day?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">If a font has poor hinting, it will look poor onscreen but look fine in print. Sometimes design applications change the way a font appears. Photoshop has four different anti-aliasing modes and each one changes the appearance of a font drastically. In Illustrator, if you create outlines, the font suddenly looks better, though it is thicker and darker when printed. Basically, when type is editable, that editablity seems to detract from its looks. The best looking type is the type that cannot be edited or selected or copied anymore. It&rsquo;s been flattened out somehow. Or printed.</div>

<p>Here we will have to disagree. Flattening the type into a graphic changes the rasterization model to a graphical one, which leads to bolder type. It also eliminates hinting. At screen resolutions, particularly at smaller sizes, I find these to be objectionable effects.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ll be the first to concede that some folks prefer this look. But most do not.</p>

<p>Reference?</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure this has been discussed, but from what I understand, based upon a few readings:</p>
<p><a href="http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2010/06/apple-retina-display/">A Jonesblog post about the Apple retina display</a>
“<em>According to a relatively recent, but authoritative study of photoreceptor density in the human retina (Curcio, C.A., K.R. Sloan, R.E. Kalina and A.E. Hendrickson 1990 Human photoreceptor topography. J. Comp. Neurol. 292:497-523.), peak cone density in the human averages 199,000 cones/mm2 with a range of 100,000 to 324,000.  Dr. Curcio et. al. calculated 77 cycles/degree or .78 arcminutes/cycle of <em>retinal</em> resolution.  However, this does not take into account the optics of the system which degrade image quality somewhat giving a commonly accepted resolution of 1 arcminute/cycle.  So, if a normal human eye can discriminate two points separated by 1 arcminute/cycle at a distance of a foot, we should be able to discriminate two points 89 micrometers apart which would work out to about 287 pixels per inch</em>.”</p>
<p>The article it references: Curcio, C. A., Sloan, K. R., Kalina, R. E. &amp; Hendrickson, A. E. (1990). Human photoreceptor topography. <em>Journal of Comparative Neurology, 292</em>(40), 497-523. doi&gt;10.1002/cne.902920402</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
“<em>We have measured the spatial density of cones and rods in eight wholemounted human retinas, obtained from seven individuals between 27 and 44 years of age, and constructed maps of photoreceptor density and between-individual variability. The average human retina contains 4.6 million cones (4.08–5.29 million). Peak foveal cone density averages 199,000 cones/mm2 and is highly variable between individuals (100,000–324,000 cones/mm2). The point of highest density may be found in an area as large as 0.032 deg2. Cone density falls steeply with increasing eccentricity and is an order of magnitude lower 1 mm away from the foveal center. Superimposed on this gradient is a streak of high cone density along the horizontal meridian. At equivalent eccentricities, cone density is 40–45% higher in nasal compared to temporal retina and slightly higher in midperipheral inferior compared to superior retina. Cone density also increases slightly in far nasal retina. The average human retina contains 92 million rods (77.9–107.3 million). In the fovea, the average horizontal diameter of the rod-free zone is 0.350 mm (1.25°). Foveal rod density increases most rapidly superiorly and least rapidly nasally. The highest rod densities are located along an elliptical ring at the eccentricity of the optic disk and extending into nasal retina with the point of highest density typically in superior retina (5/6 eyes). Rod densities decrease by 15–25% where the ring crosses the horizontal meridian. Rod density declines slowly from the rod ring to the far periphery and is highest in nasal and superior retina. Individual variability in photoreceptor density differs with retinal region and is similar for both cones and rods. Variability is highest near the fovea, reaches a minimum in the midperiphery, and then increases with eccentricity to the ora serrata. The total number of foveal cones is similar for eyes with widely varying peak cone density, consistent with the idea that the variability reflects differences in the lateral migration of photoreceptors during development. Two fellow eyes had cone and rod numbers within 8% and similar but not identical photoreceptor topography</em>.”</p>
<p>And some quick web searching:</p>
<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell#Humans">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell#Humans</a></p>
<p>It seems that there simply a finite number of photoreceptors in the human eye. This is not a question of of good or bad science, but human physiology. You can cut an eye open, and count them. If there is something I am misunderstanding, please explain, as this is a topic I am quite interested in (sans line breaks please).</p>
<p>And if the afore mentioned literature is correct, then obviously issues of rasterization and hinting are moot.</p>

<p>Hinting is only a significant portion of the time involved in making a font if the font is hand-hinted. It&rsquo;s a distinct minority of fonts for which that has been the case, to date. So I don&rsquo;t expect that eliminating the need for it would cause prices to go down.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s also hard to compare because of both text vs display and webtype subscription vs FB licensing, furthermore by Webtype vs self-hosting options. and then finally, it&rsquo;s hard to compare because of what can be auto-hinted vs what can&rsquo;t auto-hinted.</p>
<p>it goes without saying thay we&rsquo;d rather not pass these complexities on to the broad market, treating hinting like kerning, and only doing it when it&rsquo;s useful, and not e.g. charging less for monospace fonts.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you understand what I was saying. What I meant was that when you flatten type it looks closer on screen to how it will print. While it&rsquo;s editable, in most apps the type is distorted. The kerning looks uneven and bad for one thing, until it is coverted to outlines or rasterized, and then suddenly - presto - it looks nice. That is it looks nice on screen, but not nicer if you print it. That&rsquo;s the paradox I was talking about.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@HP &ldquo;but then I don&rsquo;t get your stance that Apple-style hint-dumping is OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Okay is relative. First, most of their platform is above 120 dpi, and second, the hintless rendering they do for screen is &ldquo;color&rdquo; compatible with the printed result. Compare and contrast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that highly size-specific rendering (basically simulating a bitmap font) is the way to go, at least for lo-res screens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a best way to go, and there is a way to get somewhere, and they are not always the same. I think,the best way to go is to design and hint superpolateable fonts that render like Franky from super hints and can parametrically style for size, width and weight to compensate for everything from background color to dyslexia, but that&rsquo;s not yet the way to go. Clearer, I hope.</p>
<p>@fontdesigner2 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the paradox I was talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that is a superficial paradox, with acdeeper issue being that Adobe font technology is just not engineered to optimize the appearance of every type design for both print and screen from  the same source.</p>

<p>It is distorted in ways that make it more legible. That&rsquo;s what hinting is and does: it sacrifices print-preview-style rendering in favor of making the rendering more legible, strokes more consistent, etcetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a distinct minority in preferring the look on screen of type that has been converted to outlines. Not completely alone, but a small minority. Most users prefer type that is rasterized using font-specific rules and using hinting as well.</p>
