  If you could tell me what this typeface is or something close, I'd be most appreciative.
  Thank you.

    seem to have been identified, which means it's probably custom. Disney is known
    for creating customized fonts; they did the same for Haunted Mansion (which was
    based on Runic). I think there are sites where you can download these fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/34905\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/1434\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/667\r\n"
