body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI've recently decided to design and create a monogram
  for personal use. In the era of e-mails, IMs and text messages I find myself writing
  an old-fashioned letter more and more often. The personality of the handwritten
  letter is unparalleled by electronic communication, and its old-fashioned charm
  is lovely.\r\n\r\nThus my decision to design a monogram, which will be made into
  a seal (you know, the kind with lacquer you stamp at the bottom of letters), and
  which will be printed on stationary.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think of this
  first design. The initials stand for Wouter Spaak, which is my name."

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI like the crown and the letters, but the S should not cover the
    first vertex of the W. The S needs a bit of curve fine tuning. Personally, I don't
    like the rhombuses, it makes the whole thing to busy. Do they stand for something?
    Most seal I've seen are placed in circles.\r\n\r\nCheers! \r\n__________________________________________________\r\nFischers

  body: Wouter, this is very nice. The diamonds seem a bit distracting to me though.
    Maybe there are too many?

  body: I really like this but i have to agree about the diamonds! they seem to be
    taking away from the design.
