body: "Dear Typophiles\r\n\r\nCan anyone remember or does anyone know who may have
  been the first college-level students to design their own typefaces? I ask because
  the topic came up while I was visiting with a type designer friends this last weekend.
  I know of an RIT student in the late 60's, but could there be an earlier example
  of a student type designer? I'd be very interested to find out. Meanwhile, I am
  transcribing a paper written by aforementioned RIT student describing his process
  to post on my Typophile blog later.\r\n\r\nKindest regards\r\n\r\nTeePeeCee"

  body: When Bauhaus moved to Dessau I think Bayer did some type design work with
    students, but I could be wrong.  That may be one possibility to research more
    on.

    at the Allgemeine Gewerbeschule, Basel, by 1966)\r\nProject 306 (students of Ronald
    Arnholm at the University of Georgia). \r\n\r\nBoth were released for display
    filmsetting by VGC.\r\n\r\nI'd guess there are other designs accepted for production
    that originated as student projects. How about the 1949 sketches for Univers,
    according to Friedrich Freidl?\r\n"
