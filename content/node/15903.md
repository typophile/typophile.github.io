  Type 3 FF Beowolf stopped working! I have a need to use it again after briefly played
  with it in 1994. Would anyone have any info as to how to make it work? I can select
  the fonts in OS9, but the print out from a postscript printer get substituted with
  some other fonts. I have also printed to PS but Distiller refuses to process it...\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance"

  body: "I think the point when Type 3 fonts stopped working was when ATM was added
    to the mix. ATM only supports Type 1 fonts. Perhaps if you disabled or uninstalled
    ATM and put the fonts directly in the Fonts folder (in the System Folder), they
    might work. You do have to print to a PostScript printer, of course. Whether it
    needs to be a true PostScript printer as opposed to a clone, I don't know. And
    it is not possible to see the results on screen (it never was).\r\n\r\nYou might
    also try contacting <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/\">Letterror</a> and ask
    for advice."

  body: "Thanks folks,\r\n\r\nATM in OS9 did manage to activate the fonts, though
    I didn't expect it to render the fonts on screen, I will try deactivate ATM next
    and see.\r\n\r\nI am suspecting the printer, which is an HP and it is not Adobe
    Postscript eventhough it is postscript 2 clone and I have not had issue with it
    before.\r\n\r\nReceived this email from Fontshop:\r\n\"FF Beowolf worked up through
    OS 9, as long as ATM is installed.\"\r\n\r\n!!! I specifically mentioned Type
    3 version of Beowolf, I am feeling more and more like a dinosaur..."

    especially in earlier versions. I was just explaining a known bug with its overshoot
    suppression in another thread.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have access to another printer,
    can you create a PDF as a test?\r\n\r\nT"

      Adobe may have secretly stopped supporting Type 3 fonts - my search on Adobe.com
      revealed no relevant info\r\n\r\n2. Mac OS 9 (or 8 even) may not support Type
      3\r\n\r\nAll I have now is a test print out dated sometime in 2000... Will try
      it on an old machine when I get some time."
