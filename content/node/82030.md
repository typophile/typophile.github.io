  now that I have occasionally pulled out, worked on, and then put away again until
  I had more time to repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\nI am wondering (I am by no means an
  expert in font creation) whether there is an easy way to create different weights
  in FontForge?\r\n\r\nMy typical workflow involves creating a glyph in Illustrator,
  saving it as an .svg, and then importing each glyph individually into their appropriate
  character space in FontForge. This is time consuming, but perhaps it is easier to
  create different weights in Illustrator than FontForge?\r\n\r\nI often hear of Multiple
  Master fonts, but I have no experience with creating them (and I understand they
  are outdated?)\r\n\r\nAny assistance would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!"

    import them into fontforge, and save a lot of time. Just copy each glyph to the
    appropriate slot.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend you try to work directly in Fontforge.
    The way you draw things is probably roughly the same. I never use the pen tool
    in FF - I just select the corner or curve tool and click away. Probably I could
    become more productive using the pen tool.\r\n\r\nMultiple Master isn't exactly
    outdated; Superpolater works on the same principle of Adobe's MM. Adobe type 3
    fonts are, however, deprecated. So you can't <em>release</em>  MM fonts very easily.
    But MM can be great for development. That said, Fontforge's MM implementation
    seems to be broken, and the only alternatives seem to be either Superpolator or
    to work for Adobe.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here is a thread with some help on bolds:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/74895"

    is not. If you want to a bold font then start drawing. If you want to create a
    bold font easily then stop drawing type families and move on to something that
    interests you more. \r\n\r\n<cite>Superpolater works on the same principle of
    Adobe's MM</cite>\r\n\r\nOnly if you are interpolating between only two fonts.
    Once you go beyond that it does a hell of a lot more. Try extrapolating between
    three masters on two axes with MM. For that matter, try having an MM font with
    three masters.\r\n\r\n<cite>That said, Fontforge's MM implementation seems to
    be broken, and the only alternatives seem to be either Superpolator or to work
    for Adobe.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere's also Fontlab, which has semi-functional MM support
    with an awkward but useful interface. As long as you aren't working with components
    it will do the job. One can also interpolate between two fonts with Robofab, although
    that isn't exactly the most user-friendly interface. And the MM system in Glyphs
    is supposedly wonderful."

    two interpolatable fonts in Fontforge with Element > Interpolate fonts, and you
    can select which open font to interpolate with. But that's not usually what people
    think of when you say MM.\r\n\r\nI am going to have to license a copy of Superpolator."

    a different name. \r\nselect the glyphs you want to render in a different weight\r\nFrom
    the Element menu, select Style>Change Weight\u2026\r\nSet your parameters in the

    tweaking, but it'll give you something to start with.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a clean
    version of your font in two weights, with the same number of points, starting
    points, and path directions in each corresponding glyph, you can interpolate between
    and even extrapolate beyond them using Element>Interpolate Fonts. This is not
    the Multiple Master method, but the effect is similar."
