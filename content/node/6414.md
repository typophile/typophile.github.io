  target="_blank"> yet another post</a> i read some time ago. <BR> <BR>Yes, I know
  there are some great talented women in type design, but doesn&#39;t the field seem
  heavily weighted with men even today? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering if anyone has compiled
  any kinds of statistics or could make an educated approximation of: what percentage
  of type designers have been women 1&#41; since the advent of moveable type, 2&#41;
  since 1960, 3&#41; since 1990 and 4&#41; as a percentage of type designers currently
  practicing the craft. <BR> <BR>I guess these dates are fairly arbitrary and maybe
  someone can suggest some better cutoff points but my rationale goes something like
  this: for &#40;1&#41; i think it&#39;s fairly self explanitory &#40;2&#41; to find
  out how many women have been involved in type design since the itroduction of women
  into the &#40;mainstream&#41; workforce &#40;3&#41; to find out how many women have
  been involved in type in the digital age &#40;4&#41; self-explanitory. <BR> <BR>It
  seems to me that there are more men interested in type than women, which strikes
  me as slightly strange &#40;and i could be completely wrong in my assumptions&#41;
  However maybe there are just more male type hobbyists &#40;like me&#41; whereas
  in the professional realm the field is more even. I don&#39;t know the answers to
  these questions, but I thought this would be worth discussing. If any of you have
  thoughts, insights, additional questions relating to this topic i&#39;d love to
  hear what you have to say. thanks for looking.'

    have way too many thoughts to put into one concise post, so I&#39;ll just put
    down a few things. <BR> <BR>1. There are fundamental differences between men and
    women as a whole. It&#39;s more nature than nurture. <BR> <BR>2. Please don&#39;t
    hate me, my sisters, for saying that. <BR> <BR>3. Despite differences, anyone
    is capable of doing anything they want. <BR> <BR>4. Josh Darden is 100% awesome.
    <BR> <BR>5. Broad generalizations must have exceptions. <BR> <BR>6. Text faces
    are less fun to draw than displays, but only because they are lower in contrast
    and allow less room for pleasant little idiosyncracies. But that&#39;s just my
    taste.  <BR> <BR>7. To really find out why there aren&#39;t more women in type
    design, you will have to ask women who had the opportunity but turned it down
    &#40;i.e, graphic designers, Reading graduates, etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>8. Everyone
    needs to buy the first season of Wonder Woman on DVD and marvel at how something
    could be so feminist yet so sexist at the same time. <BR> <BR>9. My thoughts are
    mainly influenced today by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060929596/qid=1093907839/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-2662433-9191230">this
    fascinating book</a>. While it makes a strong case for the nature vs. nurture
    debate, it also asserts that human beings vary so much, ergo we should focus more
    on the individual than on trying to categorize everyone into two groups.

  body: Dyana, would you please stop impressing me already? <BR> <BR>&#62; because
    they are lower in contrast <BR> <BR>This is interesting. I&#39;ve noticed that
    when I draw letterforms on paper I make them higher contrast than what they have
    to end up being. I guess I&#39;m essentially drawing the display cut. <BR> <BR>&#62;  allow
    less room for pleasant little idiosyncracies. <BR> <BR>I think this depends on
    the types of idiosyncracies, and because text type is inherently set smaller the
    details become part of the texture and don&#39;t stand out, hence to some extent
    idiosyncracy becomes more tolerable, probably even more functional. Think of Dwiggins
    for example. <BR> <BR>&#62; focus more on the individual than on trying to categorize
    everyone into two groups. <BR> <BR>I agree about the total relevance of individuality,
    but generalizations do help organize and direct thought - it&#39;s a natural heuristic
    mechanism. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;d be interested to know what percentage of students in type design programmes
    are women, and how many of them manage to get into type design professionally
    on graduation. I&#39;m impressed by the number and quality of women students at
    Reading, and some graduates seem to be succeeding in making a living at least
    in part from designing type. Anyone know what the numbers are in The Hague? <BR>
    <BR>During the industrial period, both Monotype and Linotype employed many women
    in their drawing offices. I believe the majority of Fiona Ross&#39; team at Linotype&#39;s
    non-Latin department in the 1970s were women. Of course, the &#39;designers&#39;
    whose work they prepared for manufacture were most often men, but I think one
    needs to give full recognition to the degree of typographic skill and knowledge
    that some of these women posessed and the degree to which they contributed to
    the creation of many typefaces. Of course, Fiona herself is a designer in her
    own right, and its been a great pleasure to collaborate with her. <BR> <BR>By
    the way, I can attest that cooking and ironing do not get in the way of designing
    type.

    <BR>Perhaps typographers are used to categorizing because it is vital in distributing
    type--Here I mean putting hot metal type characters back into their correct boxes
    in the job case. <BR> <BR>Why should it matter if the designer is a particular
    gender or race or from a certain part of the world? What matters is the quality
    of the work.  The only need is too determine if any group has been held back from
    the opportunity to contribute fonts or anything else.  The truth is, there is
    not much money in font design &#40;unless you are a rip-off house&#41; and it
    takes a certain &#34;love&#34; for letterforms that only the individual knows
    they have to get involved in it.  Is there a &#34;Good-old-Boy&#34; network controlling
    type design that does not allow minorities or women to design type?  I don&#39;t
    know.  My guess is that type design is too small-potatoes to warrant such activity.
    We as typographers should make sure not to discriminate against those different
    than ourselves--not that I have ever seen any such discrimination anyway.  We
    should encourage and embrace all who care to join us in our little profession
    and I am sure that we do.  I don&#39;t feel it would be proper to label designers
    by their sex, language, religion, place of origin, or their sexual preferences.
    Just let them be who they are as individuals. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'

  body: <i>The only need is too determine if any group has been held back from the
    opportunity to contribute</i> <BR> <BR>exactly the reason i started this thread.
    i believe in diversity but i know that i am boud by views that are distinctly
    male and that are distinctly American. the reason why i&#39;m interested in minorities
    is that i feel they have a lot to contribute that i could learn from. <BR>i didn&#39;t
    start this tread because i wanted to point out that men are &#34;better&#34; at
    type design or at anything. Simply stated there are significant experiences that
    shape a person - and their work that depend on sex, language, religion, place
    of origin, etc. i want to learn from all these people who have different experiences
    and different points of view. <BR>True, we are all individuals and have our own
    life experience that shapes us but some factors &#40;such as those you listed&#41;
    can be generalized to a certain extent. I believe that i could learn certain things
    on an individual level from one-on-one contact and there are other things to be
    learned from making well-formed opinions from genralizations. <BR>This is the
    reason i ask about the experience of the woman type designer - not to discriminate,
    but to be educated about what their particular experience is like, what their
    special needs are, how to help integrate more women into the field and other goals
    which i feel are worthy pursuits.

  body: '&#62; what practical steps would you/could you take to do about this? <BR>
    <BR>Here is one admittedly small thing I suggested at the ATypI Boston conference,
    during a formal brainstorming session there, where it was asked how we could get
    more women involved: Whenever a woman is chosen as a &#34;token&#34; &#40;for
    example as one of the five jurors in a type competition&#41;, she should say &#34;I&#39;ll
    only participate if there are two of us&#34;. <BR> <BR>During that discussion
    I also opined that the main reason to involve more women is because they could
    teach us things that men can&#39;t. I believe in celebrating difference. <BR>
    <BR>hhp'

    I might be mistaken, but I sense a need to put women on a pedestal, and I don&#39;t
    think that&#39;s in anyone&#39;s interest. Then again, you might have referred
    to breaking up a homosocial culture. Anyway: Involving women shouldn&#39;t be
    about teaching men things, it should be because it&#39;s the <b>right thing to
    do</b>. And that&#39;s an improvement for man<i>kind</i>. <BR>&#40;I&#39;m no
    stranger to quotas btw, but I guess that&#39;s a too hot potato.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;  <i>I
    believe in celebrating difference.</i> <BR>In typography, as in most other  places,
    the difference you want to celebrate, is hardly between man and woman, but between
    individuals. Wouldn&#39;t you agree? Or what is it you&#39;re thinking of? <BR>
    <BR>&#62; <i>what practical steps would you/could you take to do about this?</i>
    <BR>Acknowledge the problem&#39;s structural. It will get you a whole new set
    of glasses to see through. <BR>At least that worked for me. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: Women should be given special attention in type because they&#39;re 50% of
    the population but like 5% of type designers&#42;. The imbalance causes discord
    between the resultant designs and society, and it should be addressed, that&#39;s
    all. To me that makes it the right thing to do. Not discriminating against is
    another topic - we&#39;re not even close to discriminating against women in type,
    since we have so few of them. <BR> <BR>&#42; Worse with blacks. About 1% of attendees
    at TypeCon were black. The good news is that that&#39;s 1% more than ever before!  :-/
    <BR> <BR>And I want to celebrate any and all differences, especially the most
    important one in life, gender. <BR> <BR>hhp

    and i were discussing this the other day. she asked me to try and name any female
    designers &#40;graphic or type&#41; over the age of 30. then try doing the same
    for males and notice the disparity.  <BR> <BR>as an example, the reading course
    at undergraduate level has always had a high proportion of female students, often
    out-numbering the males. both genders graduate and get jobs in the design industry.
    but then babies occur &#40;amongst other things&#41;, and it seems less women
    go back to becoming designers.

  body: From my own experience, I was never taught type design at college, and my
    interest in type design came out of reading other designers speak about it. <BR>
    <BR>I was never encouraged to design type, and even my friends in design think
    it&#39;s a bit odd &#40;My girlfriend tells people I am a fontgeek... &#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I guess that all the people I know who design type have gravitated towards
    it themselves, without encouragement and maybe in those circumstances, more men
    then women take up type....  <BR> <BR>Just like Star Trek! <BR> <BR>As for what
    can change this, well I think all design students should be introduced to type,
    and creating type. As design classes now are at least 50% women &#40;in the UK
    at least&#41;, maybe an introduction to type would encourage more female designers
    to develop an interest in type. <BR> <BR>But I think everyone &#40;in the design
    field at least&#41; should be more aware of type design / designers and the work
    that goes in to making a typeface, maybe if every student had to make a typeface
    for class, then they would appreciate proffessional type designers work, and be
    more willing to part with hard cash for fonts when they reach the working world.
