  body: With the exception of the bronze plaque, these are not fonts, but rather examples
    of inscriptional lettering. A straight-on shot of the plaque would help a lot
    too. Anybody know which fonts were popularly used in Philadelphia in the 1940s
    for casting plaques? For something similar to the inscriptions in the world of
    type, might I suggest Christian Robertson's <a href="http://marketplace.veer.com/type/UMT0000386">Grant
    Avenue</a>?

    helps, and I found another of the same piece on flickr. Is it safe to say that
    this is <em>some</em> Garamond?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_4674_5901_6435.jpg]\r\n<a
