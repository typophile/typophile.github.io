  / body text typeface, and we've been attempting to redesign our website to match,
  but we're finding that while Source Sans works brilliantly on a Retina Display,
  it's much less appealing at the DPI of a typical computer screen - feels very muddy
  and cluttered.\r\n\r\nSo: can anybody recommend a webfont (paid is fine, just has
  to be available as a webfont) with a similar feel to Source Sans that performs better
  for website body text? Thanks."

    FF Kievit is the best match among their collection at least.
