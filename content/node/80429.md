  in the vein of Fedrigoni's wordmark.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fedrigoni.com/\r\n\r\nThere
  are only a few that I am aware of and like ( e.g. MVB's \"Sweet Sans\" or URW's
  or E+F's \"Castle\" ), but I know there must be others out there that I am unaware
  of. \r\n\r\nLike in that last example, I would be open to faces with very small,
  flare serifs that appear at a distance/small-size to be almost unnoticeable if this
  opens up my search.\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for any help."
