body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at an identity project, and not
  having proper graphic design (much less typographic) training under my belt, I would
  really appreciate some feedback from more discerning eyes!\r\n\r\nThe \"client\"
  is a technology startup, looking to make sense of financial networks.  The goal
  of the identity therefore is to convey the idea of innovation, and data connections
  on a global scale.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about the proportions here, but my main conundrum
  is that I would like for the text and the graphic to have a visual relationship,
  e.g. echo each other in some small detail of form (I'm thinking United Airline's
  original logo by Pentagram here...)  Any suggestions?  I'm also afraid that it looks
  really boring.\r\n\r\nI am certain I have overlooked / am unaware of many other
  problems, so please do help!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophiletest_3997.png]"

  body: "Agnes, I'm seeing a lawn sprinkler company. Or St. Louis arch or Sydney opera
    house if I were to be pressed for more associations. The mark appears to be completely
    detached from the concepts of finance, networks and analysis. You could potentially
    get an K out of it by flipping it horizontally, but this would still not add a
    meaningful and recognizable concept to it. \r\n\r\nConsider dropping the mark
    off completely for now and focusing on a typography as it too needs work. The
    \"Global Markets\" part looks off, the R lacks stable footing (for something that
    is involved with \"Global\"), the text is either too loose or too tight. Also
    it is too light. Flip through the typefaces (e.g. on MyFonts), consider a heavier
    weight, italics, small caps and lowercase. Slabs and serifs... just play with
    the type and try and find one that captures \"technology, making sense, financial
    networks\". Then, based on the type see what could work as a mark.\r\n"

- body: "I disagree with apankrat about the mark. Kinetic means energy in motion,
    and the mark conveys energy and motion. The arches, to me, look like those travel
    lines drawn across the globe to indicate air travel. It reads as \"global energy\"
    to me, which I think is very appropriate for the company. \r\n\r\nThe first set,
    first row works the best IMO. I might try putting the mark over the type, possibly
    even looking for optical connections between the top of the stems and bottom of
    the arches? The second line of type needs a more stable font; and stick to small
    caps. \r\n\r\nThe second set (your second comment) starts to look like waterfalls,
    which doesn't work. Strong color choices will squash the water associations --
    just stay away from shades of water! Finance companies tend to stick to greens,
    grays, browns; but color should really be your absolute last step. "
