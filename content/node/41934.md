  Adobe included a large chunk of their then-Postscript 1 library on, I believe, an
  Illustrator upgrade CD some 10 or so years ago. I'm wondering whether anyone knows

  essentially, steal from the fonts' real creators).\r\n\r\nThank you."

    for about $100.\r\n\r\nThe full Adobe package, like that of the other major foundaries,
    is several thousand dollars."
