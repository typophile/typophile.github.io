  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Looking at the history of type and the role that process-based limitations have played in its design, what will be the future of type design as we approach the age when retina-level displays are the norm? Limitations on the design of type will be almost completely eliminated. Without these constraints, there is only a blank canvas. What do you see as the future of type?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, lessee here. 

Technology is solving so many manufacturing issues the demand for paid labor is dropping, globally. 

Infant mortality rates are dropping, but the birthrate remains essentially constant. 

Education is just one more commodity; it's cost is through the roof.

In short, there are going to be a lot of people with no income, no useful skills, and not much hope of acquiring either. They will be hungry. And mad.

So, I'd say type design, along with most everything else, will be trampled under the feet of warring soldiers.

That do for you?

		<div class="commentbody">Ironically, the biggest limitation of screen typography is that it is scalable. Increased resolution will, I think, create a new technological monster to replace hinting -- the problem of how to adjust the appearance of typography according to absolute type size. We will have to go back to designing multi-size-specific fonts, or parametric fonts. Either way, that is a daunting constraint.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We'll probably see script fonts gradually disappearing, since the ability to read cursive seems to be on the way out.

From a recent New York Times article: "Cursive should be allowed to die. In fact, it's already dying, despite having been taught for decades," said Morgan Polikoff, assistant professor of education at the University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education. "Very small proportions of adults use cursive for their day-to-day writing...As we have done with the abacus and the slide rule, it is time to retire the teaching of cursive," Polikoff said. 

The recently established Common Core State Standards, the standardized educational benchmarks for U.S. public schools, omit cursive as a requirement. Some states, including Indiana and Hawaii, have dropped cursive from their curricula.</div>

Speed is important, because it allows the writer to capture thoughts before they dissipate.
Typing is of course faster, but if one is going to use a pen, then cursive is the way to go.
It is also a more joyful and expressive act—dancing and ﬂowing rather than marching.</div>

So it seems while the cursive form will disappear in general writing, I don't think it can disappear completely. Also, with everything looking clean, automatic, rational and all that, there is a resurgence of everything old and everything we feel nostalgic about. I suspect the cursive form won't disappear this century at least and I can barely imagine it disappearing in upcoming centuries. </div>
