  with typography. So much so, that I've now decided I'm going to create my own.\r\n\r\nI
  present to you: Camber - a delicate and tiny seriffed type.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture1qc1_4143.png]\r\n\r\nPlease
  be aware that this is my very first attempt at a typeface, and not yet produced
  in a font editing application, so nothing is set in stone just yet - especially
  the letter spacing.\r\n\r\nI'd just like some feedback on my lowercase before I
  move on to CAPS or numbers. Please let me know what you think."

    is too similar to an existing font, but I think your font looks nice. So far I've
    made a few brief attempts at creating my own typeface and I realize it's extremely
    difficult to create something subtle and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThat said here are
    a few thoughts: I think the lowercase e, o, and r should be a bit wider. I'd rotate
    the axis of the lowercase s counter clockwise a little; right now it looks like
    it might fall over. I'm not sure what it's called but I think the horizontal stroke
    of the lowercase r (the arm?) looks a too short, chopped off. At smaller sizes
    I think some variation in the width of the vertical strokes will help the letters
    look balanced."

  body: "It has some superficila similarities to my [[http://typophile.com/node/28416|Palormak]]
    font, like the tapered ends of the a, t, and f, but not so much that anyone would
    say one is derivative of the other.\r\n\r\nOverall you have a pretty good thing
    shaping up. The \"o\" is a bit pointy looking, and something is a bit awkward
    with the descender of the \"g\", but that's something I have a lot of trouble
    getting right myself."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback guys, I've had some other similar comments regarding
    the height of the e and o, problems with the letter s and g. Here is an update
