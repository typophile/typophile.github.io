    aren\u2019t any proper (and common) animal names starting with umlauts. <a href=\"http://www.aeffleundpferdle.de/\">\xC4ffle</a>
    is a little ape, \xD6chsle \u2013 as Nina explained \u2013 a little Ox. <em>The</em>
    <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/\xD6chsle_(Bahn)\">\xD6chsle</a> is a narrow
    gauge railway that ends in Ochsenhausen. \xDCberich is a German word, but it is
    neither an animal nor masculine. Although I can imagine it to be one, some creature
    living in the forest around \xDCberlingen."
