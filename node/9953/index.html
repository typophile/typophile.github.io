		<div class="commentbody">On a Mac, Alt is also often referred to as Option. <BR> <BR>The proper use of hyphen, en, and em dashes is also frequently covered by editorial style guides, since the various dashes serve different semantic purposes. <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> is a good reference, in addition to Bringhurst. <BR> <BR>In short:  <BR> <BR>Hyphens are used for hyphenating words, either because they are spelled as hyphenated compounds or because of end-of-line hyphenation.  <BR> <BR>En dashes are used for ranges of numerals. There are also special circumstances for using an en dash in certain hyphenated compounds, but editorial style guides differ on this. <BR> <BR>Em dashes are used for parenthetical statements. These are the dashes that are often represented as double hyphens in text &ndash; such as I'm doing here &ndash; and usually indicate a change in voice or a subordinate clause with a relatively looser relationship to the main statement. Style guides (editorial and typographic) differ on whether em dashes should be set on either side with full spaces, thin spaces, or set closed. <BR> <BR>HTH <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

Quark doesn't have access to a thin space, per se; but you can set the value of the flexible space in the Document Preferences &gt; Character tab. The specification is a percentage of the width of the normal space. I like to use 25%, which generally yields approximately a 16th em space. <BR> <BR>You can do this with a global search-and-replace. I usually replace all em-dashes with the string <b>\f\f</b>. (That should read <i>backslash f emdash backslash f</i>). The \f (<i>backslash f</i>) is Quark code for the flexible space. Then I follow up with a search for the [space][flexible space] combination and replace with just the flexible space, and the same for the reverse, to catch any double spaces fore and aft. <BR> <BR>You can add the command key (command-shift-opt-space) to make the flexible space non-breaking, if you need to (to prevent a line from breaking before the dash, for instance), although you can only do this manually, as far as I've discovered. <BR> <BR>If the em dash in a font is too long for your taste, but the en dash too short, you can create your own &quot;three-quarter&quot; em dash by horizontally scaling the em dash 80% or so. In this case, the scaling does no damage to the integrity of the character shape. You can define a character style specifically for applying this to your em dashes and do a search-and-replace, unchecking the Ignore Attributes box and applying your character style. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Kent. Your solution to the spacing issue is good. My script, such as it was, went like this: Do a search for an em-dash, place cursor before, go thwack-thwack-thwack on the keyboard (that's shift-command-] for you Mac folks), move the cursor to the other side, go thwack-thwack-thwack, then repeat as necessary. It was always the last thing I did on a document, so it was kind of soothing, like cleaning one's desk after a job is done. <BR> <BR>As for horizontally scaling the offending em-dash, you just blew my mind. It never occurred to me. I wish you were in my life six years ago.</div>
