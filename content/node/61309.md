  body: "This matches a font called <a href=\"http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/cnrswfte.html\">Chestnut-Plain</a>
    from the defunct font forgers SWFTE International, who were sued by Bitstream,
    et al. There is also <a href=\"http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/chesc.html\">Chestnut
    Condensed</a>.\r\n\r\nI did find another version called <a href=\"http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/chester.html\">Chesterfield</a>\r\n\r\nIn
    all of this I discovered an eye opening website...\r\n\r\n\"The history of typefaces
    is the history of forgeries\"\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/\r\n\r\nBelow
    is an overview from the the page on SWFTE\r\n\r\n------- snip --------\r\n\r\nThe
    defunct font forging company SWFTE International in Rockland (Delaware), forged
    roughly 1,600 fonts sold as CDs, at first by SWFTE itself, then by the front company
    Expert Softare, Inc. (also defunct) and in recent years under the label Fantastic
    Fonts.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned as an irony of fate that the SWFTE font forging
    company forged the fonts of the Bitstream font forging company, which had forged
    the Linotype font collection. Strangely enough, the Bitstream font forging company
    (and other font outfits, e.g. Adobe) sued the SWFTE font forging company (see
    the court file: Bitstream, Inc., et al. v. SWFTE International Ltd. Case No. 93-11067H,
    District of Mass) i.e. \"forger v. forger\", so to speak, but the claims of the
    font forging plaintiffs were dismissed by the Massachusetts court.\r\n\r\nExample:
    The original Monotype typeface 'Rockwell' was cloned by Linotype. This Linotype
    clone was forged by Bitstream and sold as 'Geometric Slab 712', and this font
    was forged by SWFTE and sold as 'Rockland'.\r\n\r\n------- snip --------\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/swfte.pdf"
