  Russia. We are at the point where we are starting to develop a color palette & research
  appropriate typeface. (The logotype and monogram are hand-lettered.) Now, this is
  a high-end salon that (depending on the success of the first location) will spread
  across the country (and maybe internationally?) like wildfire! ;) \r\n\r\nI am looking
  for two typefaces: a serif and sans serif to complement each other. The catch...they
  both need to have at least 3-4 weights and be available in both Roman AND Cyrillic
  versions. The full glyph set, numerals, punctuation, mathematical symbols, etc.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts? "

    religiously. \r\n\r\nNick, will have to take a look at those two typefaces to
    see how much of a match they are for the brand they're trying to establish/develop. "
