  body: There aren&#39;t any that come with computers that I know of. <BR> <BR>The
    only monospace font that comes with windows is Courier.  Should come with macs
    too.  It&#39;s not a sans though.

  body: Lucida Console is common on Windows PCs. Monaco is a similar design common
    on Macs. Just include both in your style sheet.

  body: '&#62;&#62;Just include both in your style sheet <BR> <BR>And specify what
    happens if they&#39;re absent - at least then you&#39;ll be able to see how your
    design degrades. If you don&#39;t specify what happens in the absence of these
    fonts, different machines will do their worst with your web site and the only
    way to test the site would be to try dozens of different set-ups.'
