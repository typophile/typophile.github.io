  body: "I've researched a dozen or so incised, Roman inscription inspired fonts (such
    as Weiss Titling, Trajan, Grand Central), but found no exact match.\r\n\r\nThe
    serif at the top of the A, the short crossbar of the E, and the W without a serif
    on its center top point are highly distinctive. It's possible that the type was
    hand-drawn (Roman or Monumental Capitals are a common exercise for calligraphers)."
