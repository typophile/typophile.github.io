  body: I think this is <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100010">Hoefler
    Text</a>. There are quite a number of fonts that contains the st ligature. Someone
    here may help you with a list? ;^)

  body: Thanks, that looks like the one! A couple of names of similar nice serifs
    with the 'st' ligature would be much appreciated. A list is perhaps above and
    beyond but if someone's feeling enthusiastic!

  body: "I think this looks like a version of Garamond, but I'm not sure which foundry.
    The R foot serif is not like the Adobe versions, because it sits flat on the baseline,
    but I can't seem to find one that seems identical in all details.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the ligatures like st and ct, most of the OpenType versions of classic serif families
    have them and some of the older (PS/TT) families do as well, usually when they
    are from the major foundries.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: But Mike, on the other hand you gave Furryvision a hint on fonts containing
    the st ligature. <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1737">Adobe
    Premier Pro</a>, <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/baskerville1757.asp">Baskerville

    and <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/delicato.asp">Delicato</a> is a
    few examples...

    actually have Hoefler so shows how poor my knowledge is!

    of the Open Type releases, especially of new serif families, will probably include
