body: Of the many events planned for TypeCon, this year&#39;s benefit auction will
  be a great way to support your typophile habits and support SOTA at the same time.
  We will have a preview list posted soon that will give you some idea of the great
  items you can bid on at the Friday night auction. <BR> <BR>More to the point, we
  are starting to collect donations for the auction. If you have a spare 1923 ATF
  catalog, signed Frederic Goudy smoke proofs, or even more modest typographic items,
  we will grateful accept all donations. We will acknowledge all donors &#40;unless
  you wish to remain anonymous&#41; and all donations are tax deductible in the US
  since SOTA is a 501&#40;c&#41;&#40;3&#41; not-for profit organization. <BR> <BR>Send
  an email to <a href="mailto:richard@typesociety.org">richard@typesociety.org </a>
  if you would like to donate any items and we will send you additional information
  on how to donate. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>RK

  body: We are getting some nice donations for the auction.  <BR> <BR>In the past,
    we have limited the auction bidding to those present at TypeCon.  Just as a hypothetical,
    what do people think of having absentee bids allowed for people who cannot make
    the conference? <BR> <BR>It is just a thought at this point. <BR> <BR>RK

  body: 'I agree with James. The auction should be for those who do attend TypeCon.
    Running the auction &#40;from the help I gave last year&#41; is a blast, confusing,
    but a blast. I think adding phone management would do remove some of that. '

  body: That said, if someone in the audience wants to bid for someone not in attendance
    &#40;with mobile to their ear&#41;, I don&#39;t see how that would distrupt the
    flow or fun. It would simply be a matter of volunteers.

  body: 'I wasn&#39;t think phone in &#40;what a nightmare that would be&#41;...just
    absentee bids with a maximum limit set. Those in attendance still have the advantage,
    but as I said...just hypothetical. '
