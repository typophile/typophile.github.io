body: "Can anyone provide me with the name of this font? \r\nUnusual wooden poster
  type. Depth of letter 48 line, outline, possibly victorian gothic design with the
  bottom fifth left solid making a decorative baseline. This could be part of a two
  colour set.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: Decorated woodtype from this era (late 1800s, US) often did not have names,
    only numbers to identify them, e.g., Ornamented No. xx.
