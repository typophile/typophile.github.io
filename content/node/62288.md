  know what font was used in this logo? The warping screws things up a bit of course,
  but certain characters are quite distinctive, like S T and E (above).\r\n\r\nWhat
  the Font and Identifont both fails miserably. I have found two fairly similar fonts,
  but they're both too quirky compared to this rather straight one. So I hope someone
  here can crack this one.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."

    sites even resembling this font.\r\n\r\nAnd it looks like an actual font that's
    just been warped in Photoshop with an outline on it, and not really a custom design.
    The repeated characters look very much alike (though of course they could still
    be \"hand made\" and just duplicated).\r\n\r\nNo one knows this one? Really? ;-)\r\n\r\nm."

  body: "Yeah, the STE are quite similar, but not the rest of the letters unfortunately.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a black and white version of the logo with the outline removed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thesingingdetective_bw_4879.jpg]\r\n\r\nMaybe
    this will help focusing on the letter forms, given that's how most fonts are presented
    on the web and in catalogues.\r\n\r\nHaven't found a good way to dewarp the entire
    logo yet though. ;-(\r\n\r\nm."
