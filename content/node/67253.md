body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'm looking for a text typeface which has two features. It should
  be something in the commercial supermarket 50's mood (the typeface I'm using for
  titles is Cooper Black). Second feature, it should be photocopiable, because final
  work is in photocopy. \r\n\r\nI know it's quite hard to find a typeface with this
  two characteristic \u2013 especially because the supermarket 50's mood is not connected
  to fax and photocopy.\r\n\r\nMaybe the solution is something inventory-like. \r\n\r\nAny
  suggestion? \r\n\r\nThanks to all typophiles!"

    hand-lettered...

  body: "<em>Souvenir is very Fifties. </em>\r\n\r\nSouvenir (1914) was a flop and
    was all but forgotten by the Fifties. It didn't show up again until it was revived
    by Photo-Lettering in the late Sixties, and then in a bigger way (more weights
    and italics added) by ITC in 1970."

  body: "Thanks to everybody!\r\n\r\nI'll try some copies with Melior, it's a nice
    one! Also, I found a great list of 50's typeface by Mark in another post on typophiles.
    Century schoolbook should be great but I'm afraid with photocopies.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14964\r\n\r\nthis
    is the link with the advertising topic."

  body: "In the end I made some tries, photocopies don't make great damages at 9pt,
    even if I use Baskerville for example. \r\n\r\nI chose Century 731 by Bitstream,
    it's a bit heavier and black, and it's quite present on the page."
