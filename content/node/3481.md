body: How big should the &#34;-mark&#34; symbols be in a font? <BR> <BR>Many fonts
  have the trademark and copyright mark at full cap height. Others have the Registered
  mark as a superior. <BR> <BR>But surely this is a mistake, because while it makes
  sense in the main text, if a typographer then has to set the character in an accompanying
  footnote, it becomes the size of a fly dropping, and too small to decipher without
  a magnifying glass. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s your experience? <BR> <BR>

  body: The contrary argument is that at display sizes, the registered and trademark
    need to be even smaller than the main text. <BR> <BR>In general, copyright is
    supposed to align with the body text, and registered and trademark symbols should
    be superiors; that is, about 1/3 of their size above the cap height, and 2/3 below,
    with the overall size being considerably smaller than the cap size. &#40;How much
    smaller being dependent on both the weight of the font and the intended average
    point size of usage.&#41; <BR> <BR>T

  body: '&#62;the intended average point size of usage <BR> <BR>But in practice that
    will vary: <BR> <BR>In my experience designing ads, flyers, and marketing newsletters,
    the Registered symbol is used in body text &#40;size 8 - 14 pt&#41; as a superscript
    to a brand name.  <BR> <BR>Then it is repeated in a footnote &#40;with the name
    of the owner of the brand&#41; as small as possible, &#40;4 - 6 pt&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>I always prefer it when fonts have a cap-height Registered symbol, because
    it is easy to &#34;superscript&#34; the symbol in the body copy, but very difficult
    to increase the size of a pre-shrunk symbol in the footnote and not have it look
    too bold and misaligned vertically. If you just set it straight, it&#39;s but
    a speck. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s why I make cap height Reg symbols in the fonts I
    design, unless they are outright display faces. <BR> <BR>However, I seem to be
    going against the flow here, so I would like to confirm with typographers:  <BR>Do
    you prefer a pre-shrunk Registered symbol in your text fonts? <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'Another thing to consider is the weight problem. I almost always go up one
    weight &#40;if possible&#41; when I use a super-shift version of the TM or R.
    Perhaps if you choose to go with the full-size method, you can increase the weight
    a bit? I don&#39;t know what other consequences you might run into if you choose
    that option. <BR> <BR>Here at Gigantacorp, we often redraw fonts for the circulars
    for superior numbers and special characters. By the time we get to the redrawing
    stage, we already know what size range we will be needing and therefore can make
    the &#34;right&#34; choice in adjusting &#34;r-balls&#34; and &#34;tms&#34; in
    size, weight and positioning. <BR> <BR>Digression: Does anyone else call them

  body: That&#39;s a big problem, that the weight and optical size is all wrong if
    one simply scales the mark to the desired size. <BR> <BR>This is an area that
    screams for a sensitive optical size treatment, with &#42;much&#42; smaller registered
    and TM symbols at large display sizes, and pretty big ones for small print. <BR>
    <BR>If you don&#39;t have separate optical sizes of the typeface, one could also
    include different size versions of the R/TM as alternates. I think I will do this
    for the typeface I&#39;m working on right now, actually.... <BR> <BR>T

  body: '<i>How far should the mark match the style of the typeface -- in particular,
    why do most italic fonts have roman marks?</i>  <BR> <BR>The answer, as always,
    is: it depends. <BR> <BR>I have strongly suspected that some sloppy font producers
    throw in a generic humanist &#34;r-ball&#34; or &#34;tm&#34; on any font they
    create. To me, it&#39;s an obvious error if the R in the registration mark doesn&#39;t
    bear a strong resemblance to the R in the typeface it &#34;modifies.&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>The &#34;depends&#34; part deals with condensing and/or obliqueing the circle
    along with the R inside the circle. That&#39;s just wrong! Keep the circle round.
    Then condense or oblique &#40;if you have to, but you really should re-draw&#41;
    the R within the circle. <BR> <BR>Of course, after I&#39;ve gone through the process
    of doing all that, the effect can be so distracting that I throw the end product
    out and default to the roman registration mark. Italic Rs within a circle sometimes
    look silly. Italic TMs sometimes look silly. <b>Avoid silly.</b> <BR> <BR>Thomas,
    I agree with Gerald -- providing alternate versions is a great solution -- I&#39;d
    be tempted to provide a version set at x-height as well.  <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: In the metal type days, fonts did not come with matching registered, trademark,
    or copyright symbols. These were purchased separately in a range of sizes and
    had generic designs. They came in only serif or sans serif if there was any choice--no
    condensed, bold or italics. Phototypesetting fonts were similarly limited. The
    idea of having these characters match the font is a recent development and one
    that seems not to have been completely worked out yet.

    <BR> <BR>As for Nick&#39;s question on weights and styles for registered marks,
    I agree with Kristen, with the additional wrinkle that I don&#39;t see any need
    to italicize the R. For whatever reason, it&#39;s just not done; it looks wrong
    to me when I try using one that is italicized. <BR> <BR>T
