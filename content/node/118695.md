  Verdana displays better on screen, but I need to put that aside and have a comparison
  strictly on the basis of metrics:\r\n\r\nIs Verdana or Arial closer to Myriad Web
  Pro in terms of sizing?\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "Note that points refer to a print font size and on screen it is relative
    to the total (invisible) box of the typeface. So the capital letters are <i>not</i>
    the same size, if you set a font in the \u201Csame point size\u201D. Second, the
    x-height (which refers to the height from baseline to the top of letters like
    x, n, m, etc.) is optically defining the size of a set font. Third, the weight
    (stroke width) of the font and the counters have an influence on the impression
    of a size too.\r\n\r\nIf you are referring to the width of setting, neither one
    of the two Web fonts comes close to Myriad Web Pro. If you want to use Arial,
    you would have to set it a little smaller (if Myriad was 18 points, Arial would
    be maybe 17 or 16), to achieve the same size impression. With Verdana the case
    is even worse, because it has a much higher x-height.\r\n\r\nWhy don\u2019t you
    use Myriad Web Pro for your website, since it was already designed for screen
    display?"

  body: "Thank you both for the reply.\r\n\r\nWe need to use these fonts inside a
    Powerpoint presentation, and we cannot embed fonts (it doesn't work that well)
    for wide sharing of the presentation. Arial is the most present font across Mac
    and PC (averaging 98.13% presence between the two platforms), with Verdana (98.11%)
    a close second (source http://www.awayback.com/revised-font-stack/).\r\n\r\nMyriad
    Web Pro comes in question because the presentations are also turned into high
    definition videos, and this font is the most suitable for this medium."

  body: "I've quickly coded a small web page using the fonts in question. The first
    group is specified in points, while the second is specified in pixels. The difference
    between the two groups is obvious, but what's relavant is that the apparent size
    difference between the fonts within the two groups stays the same.\r\n\r\nThis
    isn't PowerPoint, of course, but what I'm getting at is that specifying a size
    and applying that size to the three fonts in question will always result in Myriad
    Pro appearing smaller and taking up less space than Arial or, especially Verdana.\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://sanpitch.com/junk/comparative.png\" />\r\n\r\nNow if you somehow
    manage to display the same type so that the lines take up the same horizontal
    space, you get the following where Myriad and Arial appear almost the same size:\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://sanpitch.com/junk/comparative3.png\" />\r\n\r\nIf you display the
    three lines of type so that all the cap heights are the same you'll get this:\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://sanpitch.com/junk/comparative2.png\" />\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, but
    somewhere in all of this might be an answer, of sorts, to your question."

  body: "> we cannot embed fonts \r\n\r\nThey can't be embedded in the Mac version
    of PowerPoint, but can on a PC.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to prepare slides in
    another application such as Photoshop, and then place them as full-slide JPEGs.
    This has the advantage that you know that slide will project exactly as designed
    (unlike normal PowerPoint slides which are rendered on the fly and font substitutions,
    line breaks, shadow appearance, and other things can change depending on the computer
    used). If you're interested in this method I could offer some specific tips."

  body: "Evidently, you need to use fonts that are present on 100% of PCs and on 100%
    of Macs.\r\n\r\nI don't believe there <em>are</em> such fonts. However, you could
    just use free fonts, and have people who don't have those fonts download them
    in order to view your presentation.\r\n\r\nWhile that would be cumbersome, since
    now most people viewing your presentation would have to download and install some
    fonts, that would solve the problem - everyone can view your presentation, despite
    you being unable to embed fonts (or character outlines) in it.\r\n\r\nThe alternative
    would be to use only images and no text in the presentation, with the text being
    put into the images when it is prepared. (As JamesM mentioned above.)\r\n\r\nOf
    course, these alternatives are likely to be viewed as unacceptable; the other
    alternative would be to use a Windows computer to finalize the preparation of
    your presentation, since as noted in the thread, that would allow font embedding.\r\n\r\nOh
    - when the right font is missing, the text still displays, but with font substitution,
    which is why you were concerned about metrics. (Why you are asking about metrics
    similar to Myriad Web Pro, though, becomes obscure; neither of these systems is
    likely to substitute Myriad Web Pro for anything, if only because it's unlikely
    to be installed on their computers, and if you use Myriad Web Pro yourself, you
    don't control what those systems will substitute for it.)\r\n\r\nIn that case,
    if you use Arial, and the presentation is shown on a Mac without Arial, Helvetica
    - not Myriad Web Pro or Verdana - will be substituted. Times Roman will also find
    an adequate substitute on both systems."

  body: ">  these alternatives are likely to be viewed as unacceptable\r\n\r\nThe
    three main disadvantages to using full-screen JPEGs are:\r\n\r\n 1) Larger file
    size -- May become too large to email, but there are file transfer services available
    (sometimes free) and the client just clicks a download link (Hightail.com, for
    example)\r\n\r\n 2) The client can't make changes themselves -- Might be a deal
    breaker. I've had clients who permitted some PPTs to be made that way but not
    others.\r\n\r\n3) Tiny type is fuzzy -- But you shouldn't be using tiny type anyway.
    People in the back of the audience won't be able to read it.\r\n\r\nIn many cases
    saving slides as JPEGs works just fine. Most professional PowerPoints I've seen
    were made that way.\r\n\r\nBut I agree that embedding the font using a PC may
    be the easiest solution.\r\n\r\n> if you use Arial [and it's not available]\r\n\r\nYes,
    this is a problem with PowerPoint, font substitution can take place. Arial is
    pretty safe, especially on PCs, but I always set text boxes to \"resize text to
    fit shape\" to play it safe. The results may not be pretty but at least type won't
    get cut off."

    it makes it non-editable for the client. \r\n\r\nBut still it might be worth asking
    the client if a PDF might be a better approach for distribution. I've actually
    done that on a number of occasions (unfortunately the answer is usually no). "
