  body: I think of condensed faces as well (Helvetica Compressed or Condensed, Trade
    Gothic Bold Condensed, Univers Condensed, Compacta, etc... But, many of these
    types of banners or signs seem to be hand lettered too. So, I guess it depends
    on what you're protesting.

  body: "Agreed. You should treat the poster as an ad. By that I mean, first, develop
    a concept, then choose a type family that supports that concept.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    most well-designed posters will be legible from a great distance. A bold face
    should be set at about 126 points for every 50 feet of viewing distance."

    from Psy-ops (army, not foundry) who wanted to talk shop, but my reply to him
    was bounced back, so I don't know if he read it or not. \r\n\r\nRight Chris.\r\nAt
    protest marches there is usually a diversity of signs from the anti-establishment,
    made by individuals and many interest groups, whereas conservatives tend to rely
    on mass-produced signs furnished by corporate interests. Or perhaps they're just
    better organized.\r\nHowever, if the issue involves organized labour, you will
    also find a lot of mass-printed signs from them. "

    people, especially in the west, are just posturing, passing the time, and even
    socializing, when they think they're protesting.\r\n\r\nAnd to me protest is a
    leveraging of discord (if a neccessary one), so when it's pretty it's weaker.
    Which isn't to say it must be badly made or rough. Just not superficial.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
