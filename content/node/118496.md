  far as I know, I have this font on my computer, but I haven't been able to find
  it now that I'm looking. I searched through a couple of font viewer programs on
  my computer, but still can't find it. I created this in Inkscape, copied the image
  to another file and then didn't save the image (d'oh!). I've done all the online
  font identifying I could figure out how to do, you're my last hope. Thanks for your
  help!"

  body: Yes, that's close, but I am really trying to find something like that in the
    public domain or free for commercial use. I've searched for lookalike fonts to
    Trivia Sans, but haven't found anything yet. I'm still looking :) Thanks for your
    input!

  body: Trudi the font is only $39 - since it is for a commerical use you need to
    know that font creation is also a commerical enterprise.

  body: "I figured it out! It is Sinkin Sans 100 Thin. Inkscape rendered it slightly
    differently than I saw it anywhere else (the letters got a little thinner than
    they were showing up in the font viewers I used). \r\nHere is how it looks in

  body: Sorry about the free part, didn't know it was a sensitive topic. I'm assisting
    my husband with a small agricultural magazine that he is helping to start and
    right now we don't have the funds for extras like that. Down the road I'm sure
    that will be an expected part of the magazine (paid fonts, images, etc.). Thanks
    for the help.
