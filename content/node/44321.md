body: Hello all, just found the site and I love it. I've been looking for the Lucina
  typeface by Jakob Erbar (as well as Lumina, Lux and Phosphor--all variants of Erbar's
  eponymous typeface) and I can't seem to find it as a font. I haven't had much luck
  finding examples of it in use, either. On the web, all I've been able to find are
  passing mentions. Anybody know more about Lucina and want to elucidate?
