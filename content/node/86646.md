    be kerned? right now i am following the TXT file which i have attached.\r\nAnd
    what if you are working on a PC. is there any other tool like Metrics Machine
    for Windows?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nM"

  body: "<cite>\u2026and can i get a standard list of Characters that have to be kerned?</cite>\r\n\r\nThis
    is pretty simplified, but:\r\n\u2022 A-Z and a-z must kern against A-Z, a-z, and
    all punctuation. Don\u2019t try to avoid oddball pairs like XJ, because any pair
    you can imagine exists between Dutch, Eastern European place names, and Chinese
    transliteration.\r\n\u2022\_0-9 (Proportional figures only) must be kerned against
    0-9, currency symbols, and all punctuation.\r\n\u2022 All punctuation should be
    kerned against quotation marks. Do not forget about Czech quotes!\r\n\u2022 Some
    people even kern shit like \xAE and \u2122 against letters and punctuation. I
    don\u2019t bother because the weird marks like that look pretty bad no matter
    how they\u2019re used.\r\n\r\nThink about usage when you build your pair lists.
    For example, ampersand never kerns because it always has a space on either side,
    and backslash is only used in monospaced fonts. Brackets don\u2019t get kerned
    because they make crazy shapes and spaces anyway. \xC6 and \xDE also have a limited
    number of real-world kerns.\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026is there any other tool like Metrics
    Machine for Windows?</cite>\r\n\r\nNope. Kerning in Fontlab is possible, you just
    need to build lists of strings of transpose characters (AAABACADA\u2026). Some
    designers prefer that method to Metrics Machine."

  body: Do not ever ask FontLab to automatically kern, space, or make classes.  It
    will take longer to fix the mess it made than just do it straight off the first
    time.

  body: "thanks guys for all your replies. I have been following <em>Letters of Credit</em>
    (section 10, page 74) for spacing. \r\nThe book mentions a nice way to space glyphs
    and i was pretty comfortable with the spacing I've achieved. Is there anything
    like that for kerning? Do you just believe your eye to make the best judgement
    or do you use some kind of technique ( or just remember the kerning value for
    a pair and apply the same value for similar pairs). \r\nI've asked this question
    in a previous thread \"when do you actually start spacing?\". Most of them said
    they space as they design. is that your workflow also.Should i design all( approx
    260) glyphs and then space and kern?"

    you need to look at it in context to at least 3 glyphs. \r\n\r\n\"The spacing
    between two letters can never wrong, add a third and now you have a problem.\"

  body: "I think you'll find that if you design and then space/kern, you will end
    up designing again. I usually work on design for a little while, then go to spacing
    then take what I've learned from that and apply it to the design, then back to
    spacing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've found it helpful to use test words instead of just
    looking at kerning pairs (or trios). I have a lot more familiarity worth words
    than I do with random series of letters and this really helps me work on rhythm
    in my design."
