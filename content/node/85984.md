    a font that doesn't have that character, Word will look for any installed font
    that does have that character and substitute it -- without letting you know.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "There are two very similar looking characters in the unicode charts, 03AE
    and 1F75: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tonos-oxia_5634.jpg]  \r\n<code>\r\n03AE\tGREEK
    SMALL LETTER ETA WITH TONOS\r\n1F75\tGREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA\r\n</code>\r\nThe
    character 1F75 is in a block containing precomposed polytonic Greek characters.
    Maybe one of those two characters is missing from your font."

  body: A similar problem with U+0162 and U+0163 was reported in 2007 with Myriad
    pro (http://typophile.com/node/36473#comment-222688) on the Macintosh. I don't
    know if such things can still occur but the solution was to rename the characters
    as uni0162 and uni0163.

  body: "If something is missing from the font that is generated, you should be able
    to know from the .ttx file generated by ttx. Here is a rudimentary script that
    I wrote to find some attribute values and their paths:\r\n<PRE>\r\nimport sys,
    xml.parsers.expat\r\n\r\npath = []\r\ndef disp(path):\r\n  indent= ''\r\n  for
    a in path:\r\n    print \"%s%s\" % (indent, a)\r\n    indent = indent + '> '\r\n
    \ print ''\r\n\r\ndef start_element(name, attrs):\r\n  global path\r\n  found=False\r\n
    \ entry=[name]\r\n  for a in attrs:\r\n    entry=entry+[ [a, attrs[a]]]\r\n    if
    attrs[a] in search:\r\n      found=True\r\n  path=path+[entry]\r\n  if found:\r\n
    \   disp(path[1:])\r\ndef end_element(name):\r\n  global path\r\n  path.pop()\r\n\r\np

    = start_element\r\np.EndElementHandler = end_element\r\n\r\nfile=open(sys.argv[1])\r\nsearch=sys.argv[2:]\r\np.ParseFile(file)\r\n</PRE>\r\nIf
    the text above is copied and put in a file named <code>pathatt.py</code> and if
    you have some .ttx file, say DejaVuSans.ttx, then \r\n<PRE>\r\npython pathatt.py
    DejaVuSans.ttx etatonos 0x3ae 0x1f75 uni03AE uni1F75\r\n</PRE>\r\nwill search
    the .ttx for occurrences of etatonos, 0x3ae, etc. You need to know exactly the
    attribute strings that should be in the file: for instance, there is no leading
    zeros for hex numbers and they are lower case.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the output
    with the output from a font that is working fine, maybe you can locate the problem.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"
