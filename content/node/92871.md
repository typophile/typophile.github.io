body: "I'm making this lightweight slab intended for use at large sizes, but I've
  quickly hinted it using AFDKO autohint after setting alignment zones manually. In
  testing, strange things happen to the R, even though the hints are in the right
  place. If I move the hints a point or two up or down, the R renders properly:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-20_4069.png]\r\nI
  don't know a lot about hinting but this doesn't seem right. Anyone out there who
  can explain this?\r\n\r\nPS. Just noticed in these images the hints for the curved
  bit of the bowl are off - must have nudged them by accident. I've moved them back
  on to the points and it makes no difference to the problem at the top."
