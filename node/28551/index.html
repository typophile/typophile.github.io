<p>It seems to make a bit more sense now, but on first glance (I spotted the link on that French chap&rsquo;s blog - so context was a bit weak given my poor grasp of French) it seemed a bit left-field for an ATypI keynote - glad to see that this was just a footnote to her talk and not the whole thing.</p>

<p>I understand where you&rsquo;re coming from, and I think it&rsquo;s too much to ask smaller foundries or individual designers to give away entire typefaces. But companies like Adobe and Microsoft, which make billions of dollars selling web-development/server software, would make life a lot better for many of the designers and content buying said software by releasing more fonts for free.</p>

If you&rsquo;re a professional designer working on a Mac using Adobe CS, which is the standard, you have been bundled a shitload of free fonts, more than enough to cover all the basic typesetting requirements of your work.
If you&rsquo;re a professional, you can drop $1000 on a new tab-sized inkjet printer, an Aeron chair, a Cinema 24&quot; display, and a similar amount on 1000 fonts in Bitstream&rsquo;s Type Odyssey. If you&rsquo;re a professional, you presumably have some cash flow, and a library of fonts is a business expense like any other.
But of course, software wants to be free.</div>

<p>Generations of designers graduated from design schools for years and got zilch handed to them for free.  Type is way, way cheaper now than it ever has been in history. What you get for free today, you perceive of lesser value tomorrow. If you want free type, there is a ton of it out there now.  If you want something that you don&rsquo;t see out there for free, spend a few hundred hours and design it yourself.  You might see some value in that $30 font then.</p>

<p>But web users? The only fonts a designer can count on them to have are Arial, Verdana, Georgia, Times, and maybe Helvetica. For me, the point of having more free type out there, provided by companies like Microsoft or Adobe, is that they&rsquo;d be doing a huge favor to designers, who would finally be free to use more type without resorting to raster images or flash tricks, or funky javascript stuff. Either that or they need to do us all a favor and work out embedded type–something Adobe could have done two years ago had they kept up SVG support–and clarify the related licensing terms.</p>

But I still have to view what they make with the default choices, and it gets old. Free typefaces have a chance at becoming ubiquitous by natural selection. Ans becoming parts of standards for compatibility, that I would balk at choosing proprietary fonts for. If any decent casual fonts were truly free back-in-the-day, would we all be forced look at Comic Sans? Astigmatic One Eye makes sales today, based on the recognition their free fonts garnered them; I&rsquo;ve sold them to clients. Finally, is it not one of those things where, if you don&rsquo;t like the idea, you needn&rsquo;t participate? FOSS grows well despite MS and other major developers.</p>

I think that up to a point more bundled type would be very useful (in the absence of font embedding solutions). In particular, a light weight of any of the standard sans faces would brighten things up considerably. A display weight of Georgia would be good too.</div>

Wait how Vista is going, wait if MS allow the Vistafonts for using in earlier Win OS (XP) and if so, how they manage it to install the vistafonts for that systems automatically, plus changing the settings of cleartype to &ldquo;on&rdquo; by default.
Then wait if there is a possiblity including the vista fonts in OSX. 
In the meantime there is flash, pictures, php to get some corporate design look. Okay, it would be nice to have a &ldquo;strictly&rdquo; Georgia Print version with optical sizes and such. (or is there one, maybe Miller?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really interested in browser-based solutions (like fontface for IE) or in css-/ javascript-solution downloading fonts from foundries and such&hellip; This is not working well, i promise, if there are no standards in use, for all user agents.</p>

<p>I just picked up some extra 40-gig hard disks from a friend who was moving, maybe this weekend I&rsquo;ll install Vista on one and start checking those fonts out.

<p>I guess for the Web Fonts, we had the advantage that they were hinted for bi-level rendering, so worked just as well on Windows 3.1 and Mac OS 7 as they did on the new cutting edge Windows 95 and Mac OS 8 machines. :-)</p>
<p>So even with a free distribtion program like we had for the web fonts, many users would not get a good experience with these fonts, and as such less Web sites would specify them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s entirely the case. Linux on the desktop is still in roughly the same place with was in the 1990s (nowhere) and Apple, while growing on its own, is still losing overall market share. At some point in the not-too-distant future, when 75+ percent of the internet-connected masses are running Vista, some big corporation might do some great promotional site that only uses the Vista fonts, and Windows-friendly designers might follow. The same thing happened with Flash-for a long time nobody would think of doing entire web sites with Flash, but once a few rocks bands and movies pulled it off, all-Flash web sites became common.</p>

<p>Linux has come a long way. Give Ubuntu a try. It&rsquo;s on the cusp of picking up considerable speed in the next several years.</p>
<p>Total computer market share is completely irrelevant. A huge chunk of PC sales are strictly terminals in cubicle farms. Many won&rsquo;t even be hooked up to the internet at large.</p>
<p>As as for vista, that&rsquo;s way in the future getting 75% of the people on it. Many large corporations are just migrating to XP from 2k. So don&rsquo;t get your hopes up too much in the near-future.</p>

<p>My argument is not concerned with the pace of font adoption, only that widespread adoption of new Microsoft operating systems is inevitable. And if embedded font technology keeps advancing at the pace it has been, I think that web designers may start designing with the newer Windows fonts before we finally have a good way of just embedding any font we want.</p>
<p><cite>Linux has come a long way. Give Ubuntu a try. It’s on the cusp of picking up considerable speed in the next several years.</cite></p>
<p>So were Red Hat, and SuSE, and Mandrake, and several other distros. There&rsquo;s always some hot new Linux distro that&rsquo;s going to make it big, and just like all the others, it doesn&rsquo;t happen. The same goes for StarOffice, AbiWord, GIMP, Inkscape, and a long list of other open-source stuff that was supposed to bring Stallmanism to the masses.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the w3C would be the right organization, but this matches my personal opinion. Here&rsquo;s what I posted on El&rsquo;s blog&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With few exceptions* the successful free fonts have had corporate, governmental or other organizational backers that have bankrolled their production. This is true for SBL Hebrew, Euphemia UCAS, Vera, Verdana, Georgia, Cyberbit and pretty much every other useful free font you can mention. Time and time again it’s been proven that paying professional type designers for their time and effort is the only way to produce professional results, that the amateurs can’t match. So rather than calling on type designers and foundries to donate typefaces, perhaps it would be better to call on corporations and governments to pool their donations into a central fund that would finance the production of high quality fonts for the public domain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a type designer wants to make a free font, that&rsquo;s their choice. But my personal opinion is that if you want good results you should be prepared to put up some cash or other incentives.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s another reason I&rsquo;d rather see companies like Microsoft and Adobe, which may have some business interest in doing so, release a few good new families. It worked out very well with Verdana and Georgia-far better than it has with just about all the other free fonts out there, most of which are almost never used by anyone, for good reason.</p>
<p>Something else I&rsquo;ve been thinking about, regarding the possibility of Lupton inspiring a whole lot of designers to release more free fonts, is that even if it does happen, theres no good way to deal with distribution of the fonts for use on the web. Would users really want to deal with a few more big families, a few dozens small ones, and hundreds of display faces just to be able to use the internet and see the fonts that are available out there? This one leads me back to wishing that either Microsoft or Adobe (or better, both) would pick get their respective embedded font balls rolling again.</p>

<p>Of course, most of the good typographical stuff in CSS2 has not been implemented in any browser, and 2.1 was essentially a rolback from the W3C, since they couldn&rsquo;t get browser support. Things look equally grim for typography in CSS3&rsquo;s type stuff, assuming it ever gets out and gets even partially implemented.</p>

<p>Personally, I hope that by the time CSS3 gets implemented, someone else will have already come up with a good replacement for XHTML/CSS–and for that matter, the W3C. I also doubt that CSS2 will ever see a full implementation in Firefox or, more importantly, Internet Explorer, so CSS3 may be a lost cause.</p>

Individuals can’t do it. Short of paying dues to a trade group, the next best bet is the FOSS community. It’ll be a while that way though.</cite></p>
<p>As much as I wish the F/OSS community could make it happen, they probably won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m a reformed sysadmin/engineer, and I&rsquo;ve spent enough time in the trenches with F/OSS types to know that they code stuff that&rsquo;s of interest to F/OSS programmers. They would have done it all with SVG by now if there was serious interest. Unless someone offers a big financial bounty for a F/OSS option, it won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Does anyone else just wish that Adobe would start trying to make Flash the new PDF for the web? With Flex to handle the backend there&rsquo;s no reason that the combined talents of Adobe and Macromedia can&rsquo;t do something a lot better than the W3C has done with XHTML/CSS. It would be great for designers, who would no longer have to worry about dealing with browser incompatibilities, not to mention not having to learn their way around the obtuse mess that is HTML/XHTML/CSS/Javascript.</p>

<p>By &lsquo;a while&rsquo;, I meant FOSS could take decades. The incredible slowness that IM has moved from a mess of proprietary nightmares of incombatibility, to today, with the dawn of XMPP just barely starting to matter is aperfect example of even a geekier thing moving at FOSS speed. But hey, maybe as the /. hordes get older, they&rsquo;ll want EvenClearerType. Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;d pay the bounty. An e-book developer?</p>
<p>I think trade groups could make it happen in 4-5 years, which is still a long time in code-land. Are there even any important industry organizations? Do they have much motivations or membership?</p>
<p><em>Does anyone else just wish that Adobe would start trying to make Flash the new PDF for the web?</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Off the top of my head, I just want Adobe to not behead the vision that made Macromedia great. The competition between the two has been beneficial to me, and I don&rsquo;t know what will help keep Adobe, now an even older, larger corporation, taking risks.</p>
<p>Also, there is a lot that would need to be done to make flash light enough for little pages, and to get it as freely interlinkable/indexable as web pages. Also, as soon as Flash was open-specced, competitors would turn it&rsquo;s output into a rendering mess, like what we&rsquo;ve got now.</p>

<p>True, I myself have corrected people - Veer sells KERN &ldquo;zip-ups&rdquo; and they are blue (how sad it is that I&rsquo;m wearing mine as I type) - but for this campaign they must be green and they must be hoodies - in some way being like the OLPC concepts you see on TV&hellip;</p>

<p>It hasn&rsquo;t fizzled out. When I first learned of open source several years ago, the typographic subgenre was rather slim pickings. It is growing. And, will keep growing, things don&rsquo;t just fall out of open licenses, so the fruits will continue to be there. It won&rsquo;t be important tomorrow, but it will be important.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,I am not worried. Open fonts will inevitably take over the legible-functionality aspect of type, while the professionals will continue to cater to the specialist demands; topicality, branding, high art, prestige product, and pretty much everything else interesting today.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Basic functionality is already catered to by system-bundled fonts.
Without bundling distribution, a free font will have to be a quite remarkable design to get any kind of &ldquo;market&rdquo; penetration. It worked for Ray Larabie&rsquo;s Neuropol, but that was part of a phenomenon when digital fonts were new and trendy. Or a &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo;, like Gentium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough just to be free, a free font has to have a Big Idea and be brilliantly designed, just like retail fonts, for people to want to use it.</p>
<p>Online font retailers have done free font promotions, but have those fonts proven to have legs? At least if I spend time creating a font and marketing it, I can make something back on the work, even if it doesn&rsquo;t sell a lot or become a classic, but imagine going to the same effort for nothing, with no guarantees that anyone will even warm to it. There&rsquo;s all this BS about &ldquo;giving something to the world&rdquo;, but the likelihood the world would even want one&rsquo;s free offerings is extremely slim.</p>

<p>Legible type is going to become essential to providing food, shelter, and medicine in the third world over the next several decades. There are currently several programs (More of Nick Negroponte&rsquo;s work IIRC)that provide solar/people powered satellite internet linkups in Africa which are used by villagers to access VoIP, online information about farming and health, and current market prices (which allow farmers to get the best prices for their goods). Without good type, the information isn&rsquo;t worth much.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn&rsquo;t require every type designer to make a gift to humanity, but some good free fonts certainly won&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>As free fonts get spewed into the public domain they stay there, it&rsquo;s hard to un-public-domain a piece of IP (although some have tried) - so in one way it can’t contract. But as far as serious Open Source (rather than simply free) font development goes there&rsquo;s no growth. If anything those who were interested have lost interest.</p>
