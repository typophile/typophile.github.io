body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nTitles are set in Gill Sans (All Caps), and everybody was really
  happy with the Lorem.\r\nThe real titles are sometimes very long and I need to fit
  them on one line.\r\nI would like to keep the same feeling, but switch to something
  more condensed.\r\nI don't see any font like that in my lib, so any help would be
  very appreciated.\r\n\r\nNote :\r\nI didn't want to use Gill at first, and now I
  don't want to leave it. ain't that funny ?"
