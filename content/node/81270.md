  I feel compelled to make this public.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know anything about the
  Fontpark website? \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontpark.net\r\n\r\nPlease forgive my ignorance
  if this is legit, but it certainly doesn't look legit to me. I found some of my
  own fonts there, free to download, no questions asked. Not to mention fonts by high-profile
  international foundries, which I have contacted to inform.\r\n\r\nI Googled around
  but found few if any references to this site.\r\n\r\nWith no \"Contact\" links on
  the site (why would they?) is there any way of sending them a \"Cease and Desist\"
  notification? I'm sure someone here on Typophile must have some experience in this
  area?\r\n\r\nThanks, Wayne\r\nAustralian Type Foundry"

  body: "There are links to Fontpark's Twitter and Facebook on that page.\r\n\r\nThere
    is also a link at the bottom of the page to what appears to be their host server.
    You might contact them and inform them that they are hosting pirated software
    and it must be taken down, but there might be a communication difficulty as it
    appears to be located in Czech Republic. [[http://www.snekweb.cz/kontakt/]]"

  body: "Contact the owner of the site to remove your fonts:\r\nhttp://www.networksolutions.com/whois-search/fontpark.net\r\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/jirikovsky\r\n\r\nThere
    is a good chance he will remove your fonts to keep the site itself running. (Which
    mainly consists of the usual freeware crap fonts)\r\n\r\nNot sure about contacting
    the service provider to tell them about it, because it looks like it is the same
    person ... ;-)\r\nhttp://www.snekweb.cz/kontakt/"

  body: It seems like they've got a lot of pirated fonts on that site. Great. Yet
    another day wasted making a list of pirated fonts for some a&#115;shole.
