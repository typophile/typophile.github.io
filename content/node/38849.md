  (such as Q, R, S, etc) then work down to the simpler ones. Is there an official
  'unofficial' list of characters which a designer should start working on first,
  both in l/c and u/c? \r\nThanks!"

    of 7 or 8 character which are a good starting point) but I can't recall the book."

  body: "<cite>is that an anagram?</cite>\r\nNo, rather a [[pangram]], though only
    covering the more important/distinctive letters: [[Hamburgefontsiv]].\r\n\r\nPieter\u2019s
    advice is aiming in the same direction as Matthew Carter\u2019s (in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27479\">Helvetica
    \u2013 The Movie</a>): if you start with an \u2018h\u2019, for example, then you\u2019re
    making a decision about the look of a straight stem, the x-height aswell as the
    ascender height etc. Draw an \u2018o\u2019 and you\u2019ll know how your round
    letters will look like. After two or three letters, you\u2019ve got a lot of the
    typeface\u2019s \u2018DNA\u2019, enabling you to create a good deal of your characters."
