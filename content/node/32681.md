  since I lack the funds to purchase a letterpress at the current time. Does anyone
  know where I could buy some, or have any they'd want to sell? \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    came across my stash when I was making room for a new printer -- I've used it
    for a couple of things since and it works fine.\r\n\r\n<em>cost me hundreds of

    somewhere from a colour theory class I taught 15 years or so ago, should give
    it to a friend who does collages...."
