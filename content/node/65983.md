  is Aviano Flare. It is an extended semi sans. The intent is eyecatching elegance
  with a bit more swash and brush influence than most semi-sans faces. I welcome all
  constructive comments on the design. Any thoughts on the name? Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aviano-Flare-Sample-Page-Source_5726.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.insignedesign.com/PDFs/afsp.pdf|Above,

  body: "I'm enjoying watching this family grow! You have some interesting ideas with
    this family. I love stressed sanses, especially really thin ones like you've developed
    here, and even more so with the modulated arms like on E.\r\n\r\nOk, remember
    the salt...\r\n\r\nMy first reaction is quite strongly against the head serif
    on the A. Being thinner than the hairline strokes it looks very weak and almost
    accidental. I can see your plan but I think my inclination would be to cut it
    completely, though it may work if you make it more chunky, or shorten it.\r\n\r\nIn
    the same way, the taper on the R looks too tight and IMO would look better ending
    at about the same weight as the other hairlines. I think the current terminal
    would work well at really huge sizes, but then the other strokes could do with
    being finer.\r\n\r\nThe right side of B looks a little heavy or bumpy on the thin
    weight."
