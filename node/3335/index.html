It will contains things such as a dog blanket, food &amp; water dishes, dog treats and other such stuff. <BR> <BR>They were presented with three different concepts and this is what they're going with. I have some tweaks in mind, but overall I'm pretty pleased with it. I would like help seeing the things I shouldn't be pleased with. I'm sure they're there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the mark and the type on the second version but the letter spacing needs work. I think you need to take some space between the o and first g out in doggy and please don't crash the y into the g. In Overnight the t is floating and you can crash the ni combination a bit more. In Bag make the B a combination tighter.  <BR>Question: could you have come up with a harder to space font? I remember this font from the 70s and it never set well. If you have time take a look at ITC Caslon 224 Extra Bold, it has character and the color of the letter spacing is much better and it has some of the feel you have here. <BR>Did you do a verion of the mark with a black lab and a outline moon? I haven't seen a black moon lately.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you much for the feedback. <BR> <BR>Daniel, (I forgot to mention) you'll have to excuse my spacing on this for now. I've yet to purchase that font, so it's as spaced by myfonts.com. I do expect some difficulty in spacing it well, though. <BR> <BR>I haven't yet tried the outline moon with a black  dog, but I'm trying it real soon like. Does anyone feel the black moon is a serious issue? I'd like to know. <BR> <BR>Windsor is the name, Tiffany. I felt it was quite warm and even sleepy(?) <BR> <BR>Thanks again</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Be careful of choosing a font based on its name! <BR>Huh? I'm guessing there is a correlation, but it's not obvious to me. Do tell. <BR> <BR>Hrant, for what reason does the size of the dog concern you? The illustration goes quite small with the dog still being discernable. I don't think he could sleep comfortably on that moon if he was very much bigger. I will try him as big as I can though (the client also wanted to see this) <BR> <BR>Ole, waggy-tailed g's? I don't believe I would know how to pull that off. What are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/brighton/bold/testdrive.html?s=Doggy&amp;p=60"> these g's</a> doing? I was looking at that font(Brighton), but I don't think so. <BR> <BR>I like the sloped sides in Windsor but, maybe I'll have to reign them in some. <BR> <BR>Is there any reason why the stroke contrast differs between letters in this face.

I'll see. <BR> <BR>quick question: I've had the inkling that an Italic would be less appropriate for this, as they are less &quot;at rest&quot;. What do you all think? <BR> <BR>&gt;There is not any weight that would be perfect <BR>I'd love to know you're thoughts (or see an example) of a perfect weight for this. <BR> <BR>Johnathan, that's interesting, but I'm guessing I don't have to worry about that too much.
