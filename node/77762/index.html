  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A lengthy name for a logo, yes.  I had to create the logo with the entire 'Seattle Search Marketing .Net' was in the actual logo for identifying reasons, but also wanted to create a design element to make it pop a bit and make it easier to identify the brand.  

You will see my attached logo includes themed circles throughout, from the 'S' shaped green and blue 'black hole' (which could also resemble a spinning arrow during search) -- to the same style dot/circle between Marketing and Net.

You will see how it looks on black, which will be the main use, since the logo will be for a services/blog website.

I'm fairly happy with the results, but feel something could be missing to make it a bit stronger.  Maybe it's a font change - if anyone has any suggestions on fonts...Any thoughts?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think a short but meaningful term is perfect for naming the logo so while doing the job owner has to be wise enough. The logo represents <a href="http://www.realwebseo.com/search-engine-marketing/">search marketing</a> the company so keeping the reputation and success of the industry it’s logo has to be perfect. Thanks for a worthy detail about it.</div>

You don't HAVE to use Myriad. All that does these days is scream Apple. Search Marketing sounds like it might have a more tech vibe, but maybe the font is ok. The color scheme is also quite organic and natural. Something tells me it there ought to be a more sophisticated, deeper color palette.

But better typesetting would help tremendously. 

See the example, nothing saying its a good logo, but I'm putting it up just to say you need to think more simply:

i think your logo not providing intersting idea. Dotes can be found in a lot of logos (form 90s) try combine with name and discipline. Maybe focus on seattle and search. try to illustrate this words together. good luck.  </div>
