  this might be a worthless post... but anyone have any ideas on places to look for
  the old photlettering books like the ones on http://photolettering.com/ ? i have
  the 2 thesauruses (thesaurusi?), but im on the lookout for some of the old smaller
  books like the ones piled up in the photo in the background.\r\n\r\ni assume there
  must be some around in nyc somewhere... but id prefer to not have to resort to gallaghers
  and pay 200 bucks a book.\r\n\r\nthanks for any help!\r\njustin"

    sold a few weeks ago. And there are several people looking for them on eBay.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also use bookfinder.com and abebooks.com. Between the two they cover most
    of the online dealers in the U.S. and several in Europe. Do periodic searches
    for \"photolettering\" and \"photo lettering.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad because
    I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni"

    seem to have a few.\r\n\r\nThis site searches all the other used book sites. I've
    found some gems there.\r\n"

    ITC. Lucky pack-rat that I am I still have several of the ones shown, like \"Nostalgia\"
    signed by Ed Benguiat.\r\n\r\nIf I find any duplicates (I know I have a couple)
    I will donate what I find to <a href=\"http://typophile.com/cms/node/21405\" target=\"new\">TypeCon's
