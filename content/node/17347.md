  body: Almost any classic typeface would do (Bodonia, Caslon, Garamond), but definitely
    NOT Fraktur, which is a decidedly German typeface.

  body: "<em>which is a decidedly German typeface.</em>\r\n\r\nUp until the late-19th
    century, fraktur was the main style of type used in Denmark, Sweden, and the Czech
    lands. It was used quite a lot in the Netherlands, and even a bit in the UK and
    France, not to mention Switzlerland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This ridiculous
    idea that fraktur is a uniquely German phenominom is a 20th century construction.
    \r\n\r\nNoordzej evn points out that Fraktur itself is a French, or rather Burgundian
    invention, contrary to what German historians tend to believe.\r\n\r\nBut Joannah
    is right, I think. I'm assuing that fraktur\u2014or any blackletter\u2014wouldn't
    be a fit for 19th century Russia.\r\n\r\nWhen a traditional or modern serif isn't
    what you are looking for, what about a fat sans serif? Or a slab or clarendon?
    I know that there are Cyrillic versions of these now, but I don't know when they
    came on the scene. Would it be anachronistic to use a Cyrillic clarendon for a
    19th-century purpose?"

  body: Yes. Cyrillic Clarendons were introduced I think after WWII, when they corresponded
    nicely to the brutish mediocrity of late-Stalinist Russian culture.

  body: 'Rubbish condensed grotesques, from German-owned companies, were used for
    advertising. Reforma - what an irritating name - is a conspicuously pointless
    revival of this breed in, we are told, characteristically Russian form. I can''t
    see it. The closest typographic fit in general use to 19th century Russian high
    culture would be something like Monotype Walbaum: of the period, originally German,
    and readable.'

    Germanness is certainly a central feature of the contemporary perception of fraktur.
    And weren't you the one who singled out Germany as the country where people wouldn't
    touch fraktur with a 10-foot pole? Not that Poles get as tall as Dutchmen.  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    German (i.e., \"bad German) doesn't mean that they are right (on either count)\r\n\r\nI
    mean, really; if everyone in a country's believing in something made it right,

    beyond the immediate context of the request.\r\n\r\nThere are certain Cyrillic
    characters that have features which correspond to typeface styles in western fonts.\r\nSo,
    if you use any 19th century Latin face which has such a style, it will look slightly
    Cyrillic. For instance, these Cyrillic characters don't have straight legs, so
    don't use a typeface which has similar Latin characters that are straight-legged.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/russ1.jpg]\r\n\r\nAgain,
    Cyrillic has many characters which have a strong emphasis along the baseline,
    x-height line, and cap line, so use a Latin typeface that has a similar emphasis.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RussN.jpg]"
