  pages and I'm back again! Thank heavans for this forum and all you guys!\r\n\r\nIn
  Fontlab 5 I'm getting the \"GPOS feature 'kern' causes overflow of offset to a subtable\"
  error and I've been reading through the posts on the same subject.\r\n\r\nI'm working
  with a client's existing font files and have Regular, Italic, Bold and BoldItalic,
  all of which have the same number of glyphs, named the same and also have the identical
  features and classes.\r\n\r\nAll except the Regular font causes the error, the regular
  has the fewest kern pairs. From what I've read there is a 64k limit to the feature
  (see Thomas Phinney's comment in this post: http://typophile.com/node/47526). Given
  that, I'm guessing I simply have too many kern pairs?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nKen"
