    I just noticed something else related to &#39;Equaliser&#39;, which stumped me.:
    Take a look at &#39;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/australiantype/euron/euron/testdrive.html?s=Q%3F+similar+or+not&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Euron</a>&#39;, from <a href="http://www.atf.com.au" target="_blank">Australian

    Or is it just me.?'

    from T-26 is pretty similar, as a starting point, if you wanted to modify an exisiting
    font &#40;and we don&#39;t find the exact font&#41;.

    also T-26 is perhaps even closer.
