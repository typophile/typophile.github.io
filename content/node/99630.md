body: "Hi! I need help identifying a font that used to show up on a lot of record
  labels in the early to mid 60s (Roulette and London, for instance). Somebody told
  me it was Bell Gothic, but I'm not totally convinced; the numerals (especially the
  3 and 8) are too unique (see pictures). Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated!
  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nfurrball\r\n"

  body: That looks definitely to Bell Gothic to me. You could also switch to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/griffith-gothic/|Griffith
    Gothic]], "revival of the 1937 Mergenthaler original, redrawn as the house sans
    for Fast Company." BTW, I don't understand why you're not convinced especially
    for /3 and /8, because, part of the artefacts probably due to time and bad scanning,
    they look the same.

    body: No, I don't think it's Bell. The unusual appearances of the /3 and especially
      the /8 (where the top loop is not closed, but rather, for lack of a better word,
      untied) just don't look like Bell to me, and I've seen this font on enough old
      record labels to know. (Of course, we are talking the 60's, so maybe Bell Gothic
      was changed since then...)
