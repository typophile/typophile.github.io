  development foundation in Armenia: <a>Luys.am</a>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LuysLogos_4947.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  brief for the Latin logo was to exhibit a strong Armenian flavor, but be contemporary
  and dynamic. The Armenian logo followed suit - or rather, led from behind.\r\n\r\nThe
  letterforms are based on the TMF Nour typeface.\r\n\r\nNote: The spelling of the
  Armenian logo follows the reform orthography. The Mesropian spelling is \"\u053C\u0578\u0575\u057D\".
  \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAlthough the new logo is already in use, I would value any feedback
  no less.\r\n\r\nAlso, on Flickr:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4210138954/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    very well with each other. \r\n\r\nBut I would tighten the terminals of 's' and
    ascender of 'y'. In comparison to other glyphs they seem to be chopped."

  body: "Solid work Hrant. The Latin seems distinctly Armenized, but without that
    being too in-your-face. Seems classy and contemporary. I like this a lot.\r\n\r\nWhy
    is the Armenian version at http://www.luys.am different (no serif on the \"\u0582\")?\r\n\r\nThere's
    something about the \"s\" that's bugging me, but I can't quite put my finger on
    it. It seems a bit mechanic perhaps in terms of contrast / linking of the outlines.
    The arch-based letters seem more refined to my eye. Curious, what made you diverge
    so far from the original Nour/Harrier \"s\"?"

  body: "My (unprofessional) observations:\r\nThe curves look too overshot to my eye
    (e.g. the *interior* curve at the top of s almost looks like it aligns with the
    top of y).\r\nI also agree that the s is not quite fitting style-wise.\r\nThe
    swash underline approach (or [[http://typophile.com/cms/node/49473|whatever you'd
    call it]]) doesn't say \"contemporary\" to me, to be honest. It also seems overmechanically
    executed (see esp. the terminal of the L). But maybe I'm totally misreading the
    intention of how this is to be read.\r\nThat L-shaped letter in the middle of
    the Armenian logo might need some beefing up on its lower serif (unless downplaying
    it was intentional). "

  body: I realized in the meantime that on the website, the logos are made to be the
    same width. Was this your intention? The Armenian one seems a bit squeezed-in.

  body: To my eyes it feels more constructed than dynamic. I agree with Craig on the
    overshoot (maybe different optical sizes?), the s and the L-shaped Armenian letter.
    I also think that the angle of the terminals of both descenders is wrong. It should
    be angled/slanted more inward (to the right).

  body: "Thanks for all feedback so far!\r\nIt's been as interesting to contemplate
    as it has been useful.\r\n\r\nI guess nativity cuts both ways. I know how to make
    a logo Armenian-looking, but by the same token it's hard for me to tell if I've
    gone so far as to give it negative attributes. An Armenian looking at it will
    probably be pleased (and that's been the case quite strongly so far) but this
    logo -like most any logo- isn't intended to be viewed only by a specific ethno-cultural
    group! Although the foundation's fund-raising is probably focused on Armenian
    sources, it's not good for the logo itself to be <em>that</em> focused.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"chopped\" terminals with the horizontal shears for example are a classic Armenian
    motif. In fact -as Nina alludes to- the logo's source font (Harrier) has a traditional
    Latin structure in the \"y\" and \"s\". Changing the \"y\" was pretty easy to
    justify*; the \"s\" however was more of a stretch, and it's very possible I've
    gone too far with it. But the traditional \"s\" structure <em>did</em> clash pretty
    strongly with the rest in my view...\r\n\r\n* Latin uses that structure sometimes,
    and it\r\nmade sense to echo the \"\u0575\" from the Armenian logo.\r\n\r\nSimilarly
    the \"underline\" aspect of the \"L\" is also an Armenian motif. I have to agree
    though that it might seem old-fashioned. As for \"dynamism\", I'm hoping the slant
    does some of that (although otherwise I do admit it's pretty rigid).\r\n\r\n>
    Why is the Armenian version at http://www.luys.am different\r\n\r\nI'm working
    on that...\r\nIt seems they wanted to make the two logos comparable in width (as
    you guess) so they figured to \"just\" chop the terminal of the \"\u0582\"...
    So Craig, the beefier it was, the more chance it would get cut I guess.  :-/\r\n\r\n>
    The curves look too overshot to my eye\r\n\r\nConsidering the sourse is a text
    font, that's entirely possible. It does depend on how large they'll be setting
    this thing though. Ideally I need to make multiple versions for different sizes
    (as Jos suggested).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
