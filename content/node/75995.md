body: "Hello everybody. I know there are already some topics on interpolation, but
  non of them answer my question. All I want is to make a weight between the bold
  and the regular in my typeface automatically, using Fonlab Studio 5. I would also
  like to extrapolate using only the regular and bold to create a light, but that's
  less important. The fonlab manual is really giving me a headache and doesn't show
  a simple tutorial like thing. The typeface I'm talking about is expletus: http://www.typophile.com/node/72368\r\nit
  includes two pdf's showing the bold and regular. Any help with this would be greatly
  appreciated and off coarse other critique is also very welcome.\r\n\r\nJasper de
  Waard"

  body: So just to be clear. I'm asking for a basic Fontlab tutorial. I know what
    multiple master is and how it works etc. but I can't make Fontlab do what I want
    it to. Thanks in advance.

  body: Use the "Tools > Blend Fonts" function, and give the same glyph in the two
    fonts an identical number of BCPs, preferably of the same kind.

  body: Thanks. I'll try that. It doesn't allow me to extrapolate though. The BCPs
    are the same, because I made the bold by editing the regular.

  body: Wow. That works great! For the extrapolation I can just use "Tools > Blend
    Fonts" and then choose make Multiple master and make it into a single master when
    I have the right weight. Thanks a lot.

    an extrapolation.\r\nUnpredictable results, though! :)"

  body: "Remember that 'interpolation' is just a 'mathematical tool' to quickly get
    a range of weights, stems and spacing worked out proportionally in a family of
    fonts and styles.\r\n\r\nThe greater the axis range, the more problematic the
    results.\r\n\r\n\"intrapolation\" and \"extrapolation\", going lighter than your
    lightest and heavier than your heaviest, usually give poor results or unexpected
    results.\r\n\r\nUse it as a starting point, to establish the entire range of weights
    proportionally.\r\n\r\nThen, tweak or edit the shapes in the center weight (usually
    regular), and re-interpolated the other in-between weights again.\r\n\r\nThe closer
    the weights are apart, the better the results will be. Also, very important to
    place the vector points in similar shape transition places along the letter shape.
    A little practice and you can get better results.\r\n\r\nRemember, your eyes for
    critique process is the final stage to any successful range of weights and styles.
    Good luck."

    to Luc(as) de Groot, where a is the thickness of the thin weight and c is the
    thickness of the fat weight, for b (the optical midpoint between a and c), b\xB2=ac
    therefore b=\u221A(ac)\r\n\r\nso the magical percentage that will yield b (i.e.
    the correct stem thickness you require) is 100\xD7(\u221A(ac)-a)/(c-a). \r\n\r\nNow
    there are a bunch of people round here who don't like maths, so apologies to them.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Nick! I'll try that. sounds interesting.\r\nI alreadu noticed how
    intrapolation doesn't really work, so I'm making the light by hand. I'm only using
    interpolation for the semi-bold. As far as I can see the semi-bold won't need
    any manual adjustments. I'm still completing regular an bold though, so it will
    be a while before I upload the semi-bold to typophile."

  body: While working on Cerulea (still) I've decided it needs a few lighter weights,
    but haven't decided exactly how light, so what I'm doing is making a hairline
    version where all the strokes are only 10 units wide. It wouldn't be any use as
    a font itself, but what I have so far interpolates very nicely with the regular.

  body: "I'm sure this has been discussed elsewhere but when I was designing my first
    font, I started with a regular, then drew a bold, then extrapolated at the thin
    end (which you've called intrapolation) and made a thin that I was reasonably
    happy with, then I extrapolated with the bold at the other end and got a heavy.
    After a few months of finessing I had a thin and a heavy and four intermediate
    weights that I was more or less happy with.\r\n\r\nAs for my current design, I
    started with a hairline as Kevin describes albeit with a slightly thicker stem
    and a heavy and I'm now starting to see some progress on the regular.\r\n\r\nNick
    Shinn recently stated a preference for three masters, one range from thin to regular
    and another range from regular to black. Of course, you choose."
