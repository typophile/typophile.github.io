body: "Style sheets are a centralized method of regulating the appearance or use of
  design elements and/or wording.<!--break--> Style sheets take several different
  forms:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\nIn layout or word-processing software such as [[Adobe
  InDesign]], [[QuarkXPress]] or [[Microsoft Word]], style sheets are used to create
  predefined sets of formatting instructions (and, rarely, additional content). For
  example, a style called \"headline\" can be created that specifies how a user wants
  all the headlines to appear. The style can include which font the headline appears
  in, how large, how much [[Leading|leading]] it should have, what color it is, how
  much [[Paragraph Spacing|paragraph spacing]] or [[Letter Spacing|letter spacing]],
  etc. Any text tagged with that style will take on that formatting. Later, if the
  user wants to change one or more aspects of the headlines in the document, such
  as what color they are, the user needs only to change the definition of \"headline\"
  in the style sheet, and all of the tagged text in the document change accordingly.
  Styles in layout programs typically apply to units of paragraphs, words, characters,
  or image elements.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\nIn web design, style sheets have the
  formal name of Cascading Style Sheets ([[CSS]]). CSS works much the same way as
  style sheets for layout programs and provides greater typographic control than what
  is built into unstyled HTML, with control over font selection (with generic fallback
  specifications like <code>sans-serif</code>), size, [[Leading|leading]], [[Paragraph
  Spacing|paragraph spacing]], color, and [[Letter Spacing|letter spacing]], among
  other features. By establishing, for example, a headline style in CSS (applying
  to any of the <code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code> HTML elements), all of the
  user's headlines on a site can be consistent and easily changeable through a single
  entry in the CSS file. Since CSS separates presentation instructions from the structural
  HTML of the page, sites that use CSS are often much leaner. A good site that shows
  what can be done with CSS is <a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com\">CSS Zen Garden</a>.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nStyle
  sheets are also used as internal guidelines within an organization to maintain a
  consistent writing style. These are more usually referred to as style guides, style
  manuals or style books. These kinds of style sheets regulate whether an organization
  uses the serial comma (the final comma in a series, either \"this, that, and the
  other thing\" or \"this, that and the other thing\"), what kinds of works get italics
  or quotation marks for their titles, whether and/or how small caps are used for
  abbreviations, etc. Two of the major style guides are the <a href=\"http://www.apstylebook.com/\"><em>AP
  Stylebook</em></a> and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226103897/ref=pd_sxp_f/002-3944632-2144039?v=glance&s=books\"><em>Chicago
  Manual of Style</em></a>.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>"
