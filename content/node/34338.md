    they could feed them live to their young?

  body: "No. I didn't make myself clear. The baby rabbits would let themselves get
    skewered by the stoopid unicorns. Then when there were enough of them on one horn
    they would all throw themselves toward the ground, lift up the unicorn and run
    over to a tree and smash it to bits. The unicorn that is.\r\n\r\nThat's why there's
    so few unicorns left.\r\n\r\nThe rabbits then stored the smashed up unicorn to
    feed it to their own babies when they eventually had some.\r\n\r\nThe rabbits
    wounds from the skewering would soon heal up because unicorns are magic.\r\n\r\nIsn't
    nature amazing.\r\n\r\n"

    was a tasty meat, the French chefs are responsible for unicorn extinction.

    the California PC police with the epilepsy thing, and now you're taking on the
    Invisible Pink Unicorn people? ;-)
