  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Having recently donated $100 to Typophile, I felt I could propose the following feature requests for Typophile without coming across as overly entitled…

Sorted in descending order of desire:

<ol>
<li><strong>Personalized RSS feed to follow multiple threads</strong><br>
I've noticed some people adding a solitary period as a comment on interesting threads, presumably so that they will see related updates on their user "Track" page. This seems an indication to me of a desire for some better way to follow threads without commenting on them. The most simple way of doing this would probably be to have "Follow this" links, which would add threads to a user-customized listing / RSS stream. Even if individual RSS feeds existed for every thread, a single "Threads I'm Following" feed that was managed on the site would keep my RSS subscription list more manageable.</li>

<li><strong>Proper HTML blockquotes</strong><br>
Other than the obvious benefit of having appropriate semantic formatting, having blockquotes in the allowed HTML tags might also introduce some consistency in how users respond to each other's remarks; currently, some people will quote using emphasis tags, others will start each line with angle brackets, etc.</li>

<li><strong>Permalinks for specific comments</strong><br>
I realize that if I really want to, I can view a thread's source code and get anchor names for each comment and link accordingly, but it's tedious. <a href=http://twitter.com/ilovetypography/status/12592920561>I'm not alone</a> in the desire to have the functionality more accessible, and it doesn't need to be much more complicated than linking each comment's timestamp.</li>
</ol>

If any of these features exist and I'm just not seeing them, please feel free to correct me.

With such a momentous development as web fonts just coming over the horizon, Typophile is becoming a forum for more and more conversations that are literally changing the future of the type industry. With that in mind, some of these requested features – as rinky-dink as they may seem – are perhaps more valuable now than ever.</div>

Great to hear! This blockquote style seems as good as anything. Though … it is a bit awkward to have the indentation at the beginning of a comment. The only other thing I might try would be the indent but with a subtle vertical rule to the left (?) Maybe it'd be overkill. I trust your judgement.

Also: per-comment permalinks are great!</div>
