  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Has anyone yet had a chance to use the new Freehand MX on MacOS X yet? I am finding that Freehand 10 on a 500mhz g3 processor a little slow &#40;despite having a garden shedfull of RAM&#41;, sufficiently so to be using FontLab&#39;s own outline editing tools instead. Is MX faster?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, <BR>FreeHand 10 is, quite frankly, crap. And this is coming from someone who has been using the software for 13-odd years. Back when it was still Aldus FreeHand. I have kept up to date with the software, and use it quite a bit. The 10 version was the furthest step back I have ever seen in a software program. <BR> <BR>But, joy and gladness, FreeHand 11 is a dream. It does just what it should in ways that are smarter than previous versions of the software. I&#39;ve been using it extensively in the psat two days for - what else? - drawing letters, so have not had a chace to set type in it, or place any images or anything, but one thing I can tell you is this: Exported Generic EPS files import into FontLab 4.5.2 like a dream come true. <BR> <BR>So. FreeHand 11 = thumb&#39;s up from me. <BR> <BR>I will be curious to see everyone else&#39;s feelings. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>c</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, <BR>speed difference. Forgot to address that issue. YES! Freehand 11 works in real-time, unlike 10, which had some kind of 7-second delay, like radio. <BR> <BR>So, yes. And I&#39;m running it on a 500Mhz G4 - yes, I know, it&#39;s prehistoric - with 768MB RAM, OS X 10.2.4. <BR> <BR>Recap: Speed = yes. <BR> <BR>As for FontLab&#39;s drawing tools... I like them. Once you get used to the way that selected nodes and highlighted nodes act differently, and remember that the Control key reveals a million fun commands... <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>c</div>

I started using version 2.02 in 1989 and I can tell you the real solid and good versions &#40;if you need to use an old Mac&#41; are: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Aldus FreeHand 3.1 <BR>2&#41; Macromedia FreeHand 5.5 <BR>3&#41; Macromedia FreeHand 8 <BR>4&#41; Mcromedia FreeHand MX 11 &#40;bug fixes appreciated&#41;. <BR> <BR>Worst, crappy versions: <BR>1&#41; Aldus FreeHand 4 &#40;the Worst!!!&#41; <BR>2&#41; Macromedia FreeHand 7 &#40;Sucks Big Time!&#41; <BR>3&#41; Macromedia FreeHand 10 &#40;mostly under X&#41; <BR>At home I still have FreeHand 5.5 and 8. <BR> <BR>At work I have all versions upgraded from v3.1 to v10. We&#39;ll soon buy MX upgrade as it&#39;s available in Italian. <BR> <BR>BTW many OsX programs have printing problems due to the lack of printers&#39; drivers.

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; [Hi, HD. Actually FreeHand MX and 10 are produced without too much worry about printed production, since Macromedia is worried mostly by the use of FreeHand for web graphics. So, beside the lack of Opentype support, the application is quite solid but still have got quite big problems in dealing with complex documents for print, using various typefaces, and different encodings. This is a thing they probably have no interest in, but along with the lack of driver upgrades for many printers, undermines the use you could have made of Freehand under OsX. And I&#39;m really sorry about that. I was designing simple logos in MX a few days ago and the program quitted unexpectedly some 20-30 times during the morning. Macromedia never provided a bug fix for version 10.0 and this speaks a lot about their policy. Sad.]</div>
