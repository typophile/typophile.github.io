  to be Adobe Trump Mediaeval ...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/enduring_trump_6733.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/enduringlove_4310.jpg]\r\n\r\n...
  and the G in the logo looks an awful lot like Trump as well. But the Ns look custom,
  so I thought it was a custom design based on Trump, but then the serifs are all
  quite different from Trump (more rounded, while Trump uses harder angles). Could
  still be custom off course, but I thought I'd at least check to see if anyone here
  has any suggestion as to what the font may be. Do you guys think the designer has
  gone through all that trouble of redesigning all those details of Trump just for
  this logo, or is there some other Trump version or similar font out there that's
  a closer match than Adobe Trump?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."

    blacker on-screen than the font on the poster, but other than that it's a perfect
    match. Thanks!\r\n\r\nNick, thanks for the info posted here, as well as the further
    info you emailed me. Too bad the font isn't available for purchase. I really love
    that one.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."
