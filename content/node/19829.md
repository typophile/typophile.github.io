    body: "Couldn't be, I got it from the tattoo studio's font catalog  (you see,
      unfortunately the tattoo's mine). Im trying to sketch a design to do over it
      so I need the font, just can't remember the name - think it started with an
      'S'....\r\n\r\nWhat, no one has a tattoo font catalog lying around at home?"

  body: "i was just making a joke about the fact that the lettering could never be
    a \"font\" if it was tattooed by the tattoo artist\u2026 it might be based on
    a font, but\u2026 i'm splitting hairs, i know.\r\n\r\nanyways\u2026 why do you
    need a font anyway? why don't you just draw the letters, or trace the tattoo,
    or take a photo and draw it from that. don't be so reluctant to draw them yourself!\r\n\r\n:

  body: "\r\nif you only knew how many hebrew letters I copied to perfection by hand
    last semester in typography class :) (1st year graphic design)\r\n\r\nIts just
    really important to be as accurate as possible because of the process the design
    goes through till it ends up on my arm, and this being a cover tattoo and all..
    it needs to be perfect. BUT, Ive searched to no avail so Im opting for the photo
    and scan option and hopefully it'll be good enough to transfer. \r\n\r\nThanks
    anyway!\r\n "

  body: Ceelo, I noticed you started a thread and Zara responded, but I do agree that
    it is more than likely custom.

  body: "it all goes back to the point that i made about people always thinking that
    all lettering comes from fonts! usually stuff that's made by hand (like tattoos!!!)
    are custom designed! \r\n\r\nfonts are always made from lettering, but letters
    are not always made from fonts.\r\n\r\nbtw\r\nit's not really cool to hi-jack
    other threads\u2026 \r\n"
