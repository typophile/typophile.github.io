body: "An article (by me) about Hyphenation &amp; Justification in web browsers -
  H&amp;J on the web and in e-books, called <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-look-that-says-book/\">The
  Look That Says Book</a> published on AListApart today.\r\nPlease check out the article
  and the examples (intentionally rudimentary - very basic. Check them out in print
  preview mode, too.)\r\nEspecially grateful for comments - I'm looking very much
  to gauge the mood of design community on this.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://readableweb.com/the-look-that-says-book-on-alistapart/\">Richard

  body: "It would have been nice if you'd built a better case for H&J. Seems as if
    your primary argument is H&J = \"user expectations\". \r\n\r\nAlso would have
    been nice to call on browser makers to build hyphenation support into browsers
    so that page authors can avoid having to use the hacks you document. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nice article Richard. I've been trying to persuade our web team of the benefits
    of shy and zws for ages (long URLs in reference lists that are wider than the
    text block area are the bane of anyone checking online versions of academic articles...);
    I'll direct their attention to that hyphenator.js project page!
