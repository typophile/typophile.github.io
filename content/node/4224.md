body: 'Hey, I saw part of the film <i>Aguirre: The Wrath of God</i> about Spanish
  Conquistadors in South America, and one of the characters was signing a document,
  using a quill pen, but he also used a stencil to produce his signature.  <BR> <BR>Why
  might a stencil be used for a signature, and when were they used predominantly &#40;historically&#41;?
  Would it be for an illiterate person, or just as a standard way of writing, like
  a wax seal or something? Even the illiterate Joan of Arc signed her own letters,
  and I don&#39;t think she used a stencil or forgot the spelling of her name or anything.'
