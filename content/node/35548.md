  to agree on a new serif face for feature story body copy. We've chosen Jeremy Tankard's
  Bliss as our sans serif, which we'll use for departmental body copy and sidebars.
  \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a contemporary serif face that would be a good companion
  to Bliss? It needs to be easy to read, yet it would be nice if it also works as
  an occasional headline treatment. \r\n\r\nI like Tankard's Kingfisher and Ensched\xE9's
  Lexicon (too pricey though).\r\nhttp://www.typography.net/type/kingfisher.htm\r\nhttp://www.teff.nl/fonts/lexicon/lexicon.html
  \r\n\r\nAlso Anziano might be a possibility. \r\nhttp://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/anziano.asp\r\n\r\nWe've
  been test driving Whitman, but the editor would like to see other options.\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman\r\n\r\nHere's
  an example of how we're using Bliss in the front of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Illum_depts_4127.jpg]"

  body: "Yeah, luckily they know the importance of good typography. This is the first
    redesign in the magazine's 11 year history, so I want to have some top-notch typefaces.
    \r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions. Charter looks interesting. \r\n\r\nAnyone
    out there using Anziano?"
