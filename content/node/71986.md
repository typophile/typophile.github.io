  body: "If you're looking for a similar feel for the first one, there's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/lazybones/lazybones/\">Lazybones</a>,
    that's the first thing that comes to mind. Or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/candice-lt/regular/\">Candice</a>,
    even, the caps are a bit swashy but the lowercase is quite similar.\r\nThe fifties-style
    lettering on the second reminds me of things like <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?JTB\">Chowderhead</a>
    from fontdiner.com, or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/pink-martini-bv/pink-martini-bold/\">Pink
    Martini</a>.\r\nJust some suggestions."
