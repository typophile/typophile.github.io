  to the A NATURE OF ORDER book series. He is is well-known for the [[http://www.weepingash.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=195&Itemid=17|15
  elements of good style]], and it would be very interesting to know what font he
  himself uses in his books and articles, since the font is a design aspect as well.\r\n\r\nHe
  seems to use the same font in his books. I've tried to identify it using both myfonts.com
  and identifont.com, but alas, the font could not be found. The closest I got was
  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/freight-text/|Freight Text]]."
