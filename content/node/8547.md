  body: Andrew, <BR> <BR>Sbo&#39;s got the right idea. In the meantime, I&#39;ll  <BR>speculate...
    <BR> <BR>It seems he may have made judicious use of Avant <BR>Garde&#39;s alternates.
    As far as I know, URW is the <BR>only foundry to distribute these in digital form.
    <BR> <BR>Go to <A HREF="http://www.urwpp.de/english/schrift/wahl0-set.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.urwpp.de/english/schrift/wahl0-set.htm</A>
    <BR>and search for &#34;Avant Garde&#34;. I see the &#39;v&#39;, &#39;e&#39;,
    <BR>and &#39;c&#39; in the Avant Garde Gothic Alt book. The <BR>&#39;t&#39; could
    be customized with minimal effort.

    offering fixed settings  <BR>of type for a small fee as an alternative to   <BR>licensing
    the entire font for a larger fee. <BR>I can dig. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: ' It&#39;s not unlike what Solotype has done for years with their wood/metal/phototype
    library. &#40;Of course, they&#39;re the ones who, with Dover Press,  put out
    all those US$6.95 paperback display type specimen books.&#41; <BR> <BR>For a fee,
    they will typeset/design anything you want from their VAST collection of old wooden,
    metal or photo type. They still get a lot of work from the major magazines, as
    I understand. <BR> <BR>And yes, they have the full Avant Garde Gothic character
    set -- after all, it was designed specifically for phototype systems. My bet is
    that the sample you found is indeed Avant Garde Gothic, and was set by phototype
    &#40;perhaps even by the folks at Solotype&#41;. <BR> <BR>My second guess, based
    on the date of publication &#40;1972&#41;, is that is could have been hand set
    by the old Letraset transfer lettering system, which also offered the complete
    range of Avant Garde Gothic alternates. '
