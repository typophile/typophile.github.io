body: "I've been using Acrobat to show lecture slides, and I've noticed that the typeface
  I'm using (Adobe Chaparral Pro) doesn't rasterize in the best way in Acrobat. To
  my eye, it looks much better either using evince in Linux or GhostView in Windows.
  I've included two images below, with the one on the left Acrobat's rendering and
  the one on the right evince's render. I assume it's something like a font hinting
  issue, but the rendering options under Edit-> Preferences in Acrobat don't help.
  Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide.\r\n\r\nst"

    Adobe should have done <em>better</em> than Any Old Open Source project ..."

  body: "Some possible contributing factors:\r\n- I made the slides using the beamer
    class in xeTeX, which creates relatively small documents (smaller than letter
    size) that are then enlarged.\r\n- Further tests show that it's worst with the
    Subhead optical size of Chaparral. The other cuts rasterize better.  I notice
    that the regular variant has hinting on the cross of the 't', but the optical
    sizes don't. This may have something to do with it. I know that xeTeX does use
    optical sizes when appropriate.\r\n- Could Freetype be auto-hinting, whereas Acrobat
    is trying to use hints, but not doing it so well for on-screen rendering?\r\n\r\nSo,
    a more specific question: Does anyone know if there is any way to change the way
    that Acrobat uses hinting in order to test this hypothesis?\r\n\r\nst"

    sucks.
