body: "I've tried to ID the fonts in the series recently. While I've identified all
  the simple ones myself, these proved to be the hardest. I've decided not to post
  three separate topics, but to gather all the questions in one.\r\n1. end_of_chapter
  - definitely a font. Blackletter used in the end of each chapter.\r\n2. purity_caption
  - presumably a font. High-contrast serif in the caption of the book that Halford
  holds in his hand. This one may be handwritten or deformed standart font though.\r\n3.
  purity_sample - most likely a font. Blackletter used in the book itself. Unfortunately
  I can't give better example as it is found only twice through the series.\r\n\r\nSimilar
  fonts would also be great."
