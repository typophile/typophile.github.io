  out a quote using type.  I've chosen a quote from the end of Crime & Punishment
  as mine and thought I'd send out a request for type ideas.  I have some idea of
  what I'd like to use (no names, just ideas) but I thought I'd see if anyone here
  had any thoughts that didn't occour to me.\r\n\r\nThe quote is:\r\nRaskolnikov refused
  the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly, but distinctly said: \"It was
  I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed
  them.\"\r\n\r\nRussian book, published in 1866 if that's any help for you guys.
  \ I will be doing some mixing of fonts with this as I'd like his speech to be in
  a different style, but for the narration text I'd like something that fits the piece.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks guys, you're awesome."

  body: For 1866, your best bet is ITC Bodoni Twelve, which captures the look of the
    time very subtly without sacrificing legibility or good-size x-height. Excellent
    italic too.

  body: I thought something similar, too, John Stahle, I wanted to post ITC Fenice
    but for some synesthetic reasons I posted Veljovic. Right now STF/ITC Biblon jumped
    in my mind as a possible "otlichno" candidate.

    Bodoni 12 and it looks like it should do the job quite well.\r\n\r\n--\r\ndp"
