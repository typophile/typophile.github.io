  web (with TTFAutohint).\r\nA client asked me if I could send the OTF , with the
  TTF hinting for web.\r\n\r\nIs that possible? \r\n\r\nWhen I open the TTF file created
  with TTFAutohint in FontLab I don't see any hinting insructions... so I can't copy
  them to the OTF file... but it still works perfect for the web... \r\n\r\nThank
  you guys.\r\n"

    formats. \r\n\r\nTTF uses TrueType quadratic B\xE9zier curves, OTF (also known
    as CFF for Compact Font Format) uses PostScript cubic B\xE9zier curves. They are
    related, but not the same, so the hints are not compatible or transferable.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, you can autohint an OTF font using the autohint tool that comes with the
    AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType) or the autohint command in FontLab.
    (You can also run the Adobe autohinter from within FontLab using a script that
    comes with the AFDKO.) The results won\u2019t be the same as a hinted TTF font
    because the format and the way hinting works is different."

    a <em>unification</em> of Microsoft/Apple's TrueType, and Adobe's Type 1 (CFF)
    format. The file header indicates what sort of outlines the font contains - it
    can be either one.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, \"OTF without hinting, and TTF for
    web\" makes no sense without specifying what kind of OTF it is."

  body: "@Theunis \r\nYou are right in a technical sense, but 99% of fonts with the
    suffix OTF are in fact CFF-based, while TrueType flavoured fonts use TTF. So Mark\u2019s
    comment just reflects what people understand when these terms and abbreviations
    are used. Also note that Mark actually said \u201COTF\u201D (referring to the
    file suffix) \u2014 it was you who then talked about \u201COpenType format\u201D.
    Those things belong together, but there effectively not the same thing.  \r\n\r\n<cite>A
    client asked me if I could send the OTF , with the TTF hinting for web.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    would ask them what he is trying to achieve. I am pretty sure he is himself confused
    about those technical details and therefore makes this rather strange request. "

    a self perpetuating myth which had no raison d'\xEAtre for decades now.\r\nMoreover,
    as already mentioned by others, file extensions and outlines and features are
    different things. And, for what I know, TTF fonts can have OpenType features."

  body: "No, for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, I don't think \"most\" printers use
    PostScript natively. There is a thick layer of driver software between the font
    file and the printer.\r\n\r\nSecond: font formats may be changed by the OS, by
    user-end software, or by printer drivers to suit the destination device.\r\n\r\nThird:
    native support for TrueType fonts has actually been added to PostScript, years
    ago :P\r\n\r\nFor everyday practical purposes there really is no difference between
    TrueType and PostScript flavour fonts -- especially when both are wrapped inside
    an OTF. A designer may have a preference (me, I can't wrap my head around quadratic
    curves) and some older tools such as MS Volt work on a TTF format only -- but
    even that can be worked around."

    software. But the results depend on your setting on the font and character level.
    \r\n\r\n<cite>But OTF PostScript curves are better for printing \u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn\u2019t know why. There were a RIPs in the early 1990s which couldn\u2019t
    handle TrueType, but that was a long time ago. \r\nThe only argument against TrueType
    outlines is that the designer has probably done the design in PostScript and the
    automatic conversion could lead to outlines which are not identical to the original.
    But that isn\u2019t even a limitation of TrueType, but only a problem of the conversion
    process. \r\n"

    TrueType flavored OpenType equally with their PostScript-outline counterparts.
    That position is well founded in reality.\r\n\r\nThere is a bias in the graphic

    are a very few devices and workflows, usually very old, where TrueType fonts are
