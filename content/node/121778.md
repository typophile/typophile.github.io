    ''A'' and the ''T''. '

    are redrawn, some with almost unnoticeable  differences, while others are  quite
    different.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P22ArtsCraftsLightMisc_3819.gif]\r\nDon"

  body: "Don, the |B| in your sample is actually a |b|. Arts and Crafts' |B| has a
    shape more similar to the original sample.\r\nAnother typeface based on Dard Hunter's
    work, NIck Curtis' Bala Cynwyd has the the right |S|, but not much else.\r\nYet
    it seems to me I've already seen this. Can't remember where. Typodermic? DaFont?
    Behance?\r\nOr it could just be a modified Arts and Crafts (flipped |V| for |A|,
    etc.)."

  body: "Riccardo, my sample was a mix of upper and lower case, chosen so as to be
    closest to the lettering.\r\nI agree the lettering looks like one of the creations
    at Behance or DaFont.\r\nNet effect is still quite kanji, so it works for the
    poster.\r\nDon"
