    if the journal in which this appeared is not available locally?

    loan was 3 months ago, and still no awnser ;).\r\nPerhaps someone could make a
    digitalization? Its a Journal, rigth? I mean is public domain, no?\r\n\r\nThis
    article its refered in several places, so I think is a good one, but perhaps there
    are some online that could do the work?\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio

    no, not public domain. Most publishers of journals are just as interested in getting
    their subscription monies as type designers are in getting their licensing fees.
    Whodathunk!"

    not really. Being public is different than being in the public domain. The article
    would still be under copyright and should not be reproduced <em>in toto</em> publicly
    (digitally or otherwise) without the author's permission.\r\n\r\nLooks like many
    back issues of the <em>Printing History</em> journal, including the one you seek,
    are still in print and available for purchase directly from the APHA. Info here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.printinghistory.org/publications/printing-history/back-issues.php\r\n\r\nDoesn't
    look like an order form is available yet, however, so you may have to contact
    someone directly. \r\n\r\n"

    recently visited a public library here in Portugal in order to get an digitalisation
    of an article from a newspaper 50 years ago. I asked the question: what about
    copyrigths? Answer: Its a newspaper, its public domain. Only if you want to reproduce
    the complete newspaper that could be necessary author/editor permission. Perhaps
    the law is diferent here?\r\n\r\nI want to read the article. Not to produce or
    use it in any kind of publication...\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    also a lawyer? I suspect he/she meant that the newspaper wouldn't come after them
    about the copyright, so it doesn't matter. Be assured that a newspaper is not
    public domain. Unless the copyright period is under 50 years in Portugal, that
    is."

    that, of course, is tied with the \u201Cnews\u201D part. Therefore it doesn\u2019t
