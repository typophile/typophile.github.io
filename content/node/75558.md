  have all glyphs for Western European, and just need to make the comma below for
  Central European.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    legibility. The opposite occurs with |i| + accents, with an excessive gap.\r\n\r\n|d|
    + commaccent is inverted. Hungarumlaut will collide in small sizes, you may space
    it a bit. Armstrong does not works, IMHO. Slash for |O| is not centered. Slash
    for |o| seems very heavy.\r\n\r\nOthers accents are OK, especially tilde and cedilla."

  body: "Give acute and grave steeper slope so they can more easily be told apart.\r\nRaise
    lowercase accents to the upper middle of the ascender space.\r\n\r\nThe ring is
    supposed to be a circle. Usually it's unstressed or at least evenly stressed.
    The connected form of \xC5 is a compromise for limited space, and should be avoided
    if possible. To connect lowercase \xE5 is never done. And of course the broken
    thing on \u016E/\u016F is completely unrecognizable."

  body: "Just a few weeks ago I came across this website: http://diacritics.typo.cz/\r\nIt's
    very helpfull for what you're doing right now. One of the things it states is
    that Polish people won't recognize your grave or acute because they're more horizontal
    than vertical, so you might change that or make an alternate. The rest has already
    been said by Freiberger and Cerulean."
