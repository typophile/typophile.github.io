  body: Last time I remember looking at one of Slimbach&#39;s fonts, I saw kerns of
    -3, -2, and even -1. Kerns like that don&#39;t make much sense to me. I don&#39;t
    think it was the result of interpolation, but I could be wrong

  body: No evidence. It was just a shot in the dark. For all I know, Twombly does
    the same thing. I just don&#39;t have any Slimbach fonts lying around to take
    an &#42;educated&#42; guess, that&#39;s all. <BR> <BR>For what it&#39;s worth,
    I usually delete kerns below 7 that are a result of interpolation. 7, 8, and 9
    get rounded up to 10. I&#39;m adamantly multiples-of-5 when it comes to kerning,
    for slightly arbitrary reasons, but also because it often makes a search/replace
    much faster.

  body: 'Karen, Slimbach rarely says anything in public, and in my 5&#43; years on
    discussion groups I haven&#39;t seen a single piece of participation from him.
    So any &#34;documentation&#34; about this is going to be second-hand, but also
    through observation. If I&#39;m not mistaken David Lemon &#40;on maybe it was
    JFP&#41; has pointed out that Slimbach doesn&#39;t use trapping, but if you just
    look at his work, it&#39;s obvious anyway. <BR> <BR>His reasons are probably the
    same as for any accomplished type designer who doesn&#39;t put trapping: <BR>1&#41;
    Even if he thinks it helps a little bit, it&#39;s not cost-effective: the gain
    is too small compared to the effort. <BR>2&#41; In large sizes trapping &#40;generally&#41;
    looks ugly. <BR>3&#41; There&#39;s no methodical way of putting in traps, and
    that&#39;s a Modernist/Western turn-off. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t argue with #1 too
    much - it&#39;s a personal balance of craftsmanship versus delivery of goods.  On
    the other hand, pretty soon this reason will disappear... As for #2, I would counter
    that the people who notice traps at larger sizes are the same people who know
    they should be using the display cut of the font instead anyway! And when it comes
    to #3, I&#39;d say it&#39;s all in your head. A desire for absolute consistency
    shouldn&#39;t trump real-world quality. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/7027.html?1056591110</a>
    <BR> <BR>I learned from Kent Lew there that Slimbach had made changes from the
    regular to the MM version &#40;no longer sold&#41;, and then again to the Open
    Type version. And John Nolan said he thought the Open Type version was best, even
    though in general he liked the MM technology.  <BR> <BR>This led me to get the
    Open Type version, and also &#40;with your encouragement&#41; to upgrade from
    PageMaker to InDesign - which is wonderful.  <BR> <BR>Now, checking the new version
    with my own eyes, and setting my book in progress in the OT Minion, I find that
    the regular weight has gone on a diet, and is now slimmer and prettier. It is
    between the old regular and display weights. I also sets at nearly the same width
    as the old display weight - perhaps 5% more narrow than the old regular &#40;I
    haven&#39;t measured it&#41;.  <BR> <BR>What led me to my first post here at typofile
    was the feeling that something was wrong with the regular Minion. It looked too
    clotted to me at 11 points &#40;though not at 10 points&#41;; too closely spaced
    or something I couldn&#39;t exactly put my finger on.  <BR> <BR>I am still not
    sure what all went into the changes Slimbach made, but I sure think they are an
    improvement. My former feelings that something was wrong have now vanished, and
    I think it is a real solid workhorse for text, with some elegance.   '
