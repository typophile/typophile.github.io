body: "My name is Nathan Monk. I'm a third year student at Birmingham Institute of
  Art & Design (BIAD, UK), co-founder and director of Smile Creative Consultants (www.doesntcostapenny.com)
  and now, creator of Font Lorry (www.fontlorry.com). \r\n\r\nFont Lorry is my 3rd
  year negotiated project. I am looking for your help so first I will tell you a little
  bit about the idea;\r\n\r\n\"I intend to create an online distribution platform
  for emerging typographic talent. Whilst at first this may appear to be a font foundry,
  I believe I can make this into a viable structure for typographic goods of all natures.\r\n\r\nI
  will turn Font Lorry into a reliable distribution channel for designers to get original
  content noticed by a global audience and increase future interest in their work.\r\n\r\nI
  plan to catalogue typefaces, novelty items, icons, merchandise, desktop wallpapers,
  limited edition prints and typographic essays.\"\r\n\r\nTo make this project a success,
  I require content to launch Font Lorry with. If you have any typographically orientated
  works that you feel would benefit yourself and Font Lorry from the unique platform
  that I am proposing, then please feel free to contact me via hello@fontlorry.com
  \r\n\r\nI have been in talks with Caroline Archer and Alex Parre from Type (formerly
  typevents, www.uktype.com) and after redesigning their website during the summer
  as part of Smile, they have assured me that they will provide me with global exposure
  using their mailing list and database. This is very exciting as they deal with major
  media companies such as Wallpaper* Magazine, Adobe and FontWorks to name a few!\r\n\r\nFont
  Lorry will also be exhibiting at Plus International Design Festival (www.youplusus.net)
  at Smile Creative Consultants' stand.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that this would be of
  any interest to anyone that you know, please pass along this message.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFont
  Lorry is also collaborating with Smile on a project called Type Attire. \r\n\r\nType
  Attire is a project bringing together creatives from all over the world by customising
  t-shirts, trainers and totes. These will then be made available to the public on
  Smile Font Lorry (www.fontlorry.com) some will even be Exhibited at Plus International
  Design Festival.\r\nIf you want to get involved, there are 2 very simple ways. \r\n\r\nCome
  down to Plus International Design Festival, head over to the Smile stand and doodle
  to your hearts content!\r\nYou can submit your design via the power of the internet
  and be one of the first to be exhibited at a major design festival. Download all
  the necessary files from www.doesntcostapenny.com/typeattire\r\n\r\nYou can find
  all of the more intricate details at www.doesntcostapenny.com/typeattire\r\n\r\nI
  have attached a flyer regarding Type Attire for your viewing pleasure. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
