body: 'My wife Caroline, a textile designer &#40;wovens, mostly upholstery&#41;, wants
  a sans for use herself in correspondence, invoices and so on, and that she can use
  for printed material. It needs therefore to work on ordinary laser-printed output,
  as well as properly set and printed. She is insistent it be sans. She is quite interested
  in the idea of having one face for headings, titles etc, and another for the text
  ... in which case I suspect we&#39;d go for a geometric/distinctive titling face
  and a more humanist and blander text face. <BR> <BR>I find the choice bewildering.
  Of the fonts you see around a lot she likes both Gill and Futura, but she sensibly
  wants something different. She likes OS figures. She likes Futura for its Bauhaus
  connections &#40;a lot of her textile work is Bauhaus inspired&#41; more than for
  what it looks like, I think. She tends to shrink away from anything quirky -- she
  reckons, probably rightly, that she needs something pretty plain. &#40;She finds
  Lux and Giacomo, for instance, which I like a lot, too odd in parts.&#41; <BR> <BR>The
  current menu is: FF Kievit, TheSans, Syntax, Bliss, Parisine. I feel like a kid
  in a candy store, and simply cannot commit: but I can&#39;t afford to buy them all
  to try them out. <BR> <BR>Any views, on these or others? We&#39;d need only two
  weights, I think. <BR> <BR>PS: from a personal point of view, since she is an American
  living in London, anything American &#40;a fortiori anything RISD&#41; would give
  her secret pleasure. But that&#39;s really a side issue: what she really wants is
  the best type for the job.'

  body: Maybe Fedra SANS but it&#39;s way expensive. FF kievit is the most neutral
    font of your list &#40;at least for me&#41;. Never tried Linotype Syntax. Bliss
    is nice, so is Parisine. The The Sans italics are delicious. Typophile candy store

  body: I agree that Kievit is the most neutral option on the list and sounds like
    a good choice, but not having worked with iit myself I can&#39;t say much beyond
    aestetics. You can find some delicious old style sans figures in Martin Majoor&#39;s
    Scala Sans, wich obviously pairs beautifully with Scala.

  body: RISD, huh? Alot of RISD designers have done work for Font Bureau, but I&#39;m
    guessing Interstate is not the way for your wife to go &#40;although that is quite
    &#34;american&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>What about Freer-Jones&#39; new Gotham from
    Hoefler Type? That gives you RISD, Americana, New York, and perhaps the modern
    flavor, too? The Bauh

  body: If you&#39;re looking for neutral, plain, American, and RISD, then I might
    suggest you consider a few weights/widths of <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=BentonSans"
    target="_blank"> Benton Sans</a> from the Font Bureau. <BR> <BR>This is based
    on the quintessentially American industrial sans serifs of Morris Fuller Benton.
    Designers Tobias Frere-Jones and Cyrus Highsmith both attended RISD &#40;and have
    returned to teach there periodically, if I&#39;m not mistaken&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Earlier
    versions of this family are the simple sans that you will still find used throughout
    <i>Martha Stewart Living</i> &#40;although, in the current design of the magazine,
    the Benton takes more of a back seat to the new Hoefler slab-serif face&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I think Benton Sans would make a fine, versatile, all-purpose typeface
    for a textile designer. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think OS figures are part of the
    general release, but they may be available. If you call the Font Bureau, Harry
    or Samantha can tell you if it&#39;s possible to get an OS version instead. <BR>

    target="_blank"> Gotham</a> is an excellent one. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: Thanks to all for those comments ... though they have &#34;helped&#34; only
    by making the decision even harder. <BR> <BR>Benton and Gotham both look like
    runners, in their different ways. I don&#39;t think OS figures are really an issue
    for her. I&#39;ll let her decide. <BR> <BR>&#40;It&#39;s wonderful, by the way,
    how when one starts to look for a font for a specific purpose, if one digs around
    long enough, one finds too many good possibilities, not too few. Now why can&#39;t
    everything be like that?&#41;
