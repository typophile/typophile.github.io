    you quite expertly. But Rosetta's stuff is definitely a strong option too. I'll
    alert both of them to this thread and they can duke it out.  :->\r\n\r\nBTW there
    are in fact differences in taste between Arabs and Iranians when it comes to type.
    Also note that two of their numerals are different (although one of those is only
    mildly so). At least for any large/display type you should seriously consider
    diverging your design. Not least because they don't like being mistaken for one-another...\r\n\r\nWow,
    I just had [another] great idea. Too good to reveal yet.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, what should I add. Thanks for the recommendations of Rosetta fonts.
    You have essentially three options:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://rosettatype.com/Nassim\">Nassim</a>
    which is currently most know for being used by BBC Arabic/Persian/Urdu/Pashto
    in language-specific design versions, probably most classic from the lot.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://rosettatype.com/Aisha\">Aisha</a> which is more playful, but still
    solid Arabic typeface in Maghribi style.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://rosettatype.com/Eskorte\">Eskorte</a>
    which is an excellent design, softer, but still serious. And the accompanying
    Latin is proper Pro font with small caps and other typographic extras.\r\n\r\nNassim
    and Aisha are by Titus Nemeth, Eskorte is by Elena Schneider, but it was developed
    with Titus\u2019 consultancy. These are high-quality OpenType fonts and available
    as webfonts.\r\n\r\nIf you have more questions, do not hesitate and get in touch
    via email david@rosettatype.com .\r\n"
