  it anywhere else than <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/4093664660/\">these
  pouches</a>, and kinda never expected this to exist as a [digital] font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sachet_6401.jpg]\r\nNow
  I've spotted something that looks like it's at least trying to do a similar thing,
  in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezyRovNSaHs\">this Youtube video</a>.
  It's not quite the same (and not as nice I think \u2013 it loses some of the Clockwork-Orange-meets-Flower-Power
  charme of the above) but I'm still curious. (I wish I could read what it says in
  the font menu there.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sachet2_6131.jpg]\r\nSo,
  can anyone name either of these, and/or point me towards fonts that match this overall
  concept?"

    the divergences that are in the digital. Thanks, in any case.

  body: Ah, what? I *did* look at DaFont, but only in 'Groooovy'. Should have checked
    'Decorative' as well, I guess, but thought Groovy would have had it covered. I
    mean, if the flowery <a href="http://www.dafont.com/chick.font?nb_ppp=50&text=YOU+CHOOSE">Chick</a>
    is filed under Groovy, why not Flores as well? Who's in charge over there? :)

    if you sort of squint you can read it in the type menu after you know what it
    says. if someone ever found more original source letters, i'd love to make it
    more authentic. cbs sunday morning news used to use display font headlines on
    a board for upcoming stories. i sent them a CD just for fun, perhaps someone there
    actually loaded it and used it.\r\n\r\n"

    first sample I posted above \u2013  would you think it's the same \"font\" (if
    it ever was a font)? And what do you think about the glyphs that differ from your
    version, like the \"C\" and \"H\"?"

    a copy of the updated Flores. He wrote <em>\"i was so jazzed about getting more
    source letters for Flores, that i worked them into the font in the lowercase positions
    and tweaked a couple other things.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>attaching it for you now and
    i sent it to the original poster.\"</em>\r\n\r\nI will make a sample, unless Nina
    would like to, showing the glyphs of the revised font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"

    I made the sample he has even corrected the lower case Q, and sent me a new version.
    There is an e-mail link on his site, if the font download is still the old version.\r\n\r\n-
