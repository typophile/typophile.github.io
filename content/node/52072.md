  about Adrian himself unfortunately for me I need information about the typeface\r\nHe
  doesnt mention the face Frutiger much, though I have found some information about
  the typeface he designed for the airport in France called; Roissy which is i think
  Frutiger but it doesnt say much.\r\n\r\nI need a little information on how to distict
  this typeface (Frutiger) with popular typefaces like Helvetica, Univers(Adrian again),
  etc. etc. \r\n\r\nOr maybe something about its personality.\r\nI found a few little
  companies that use Frutiger on the corporate identity.\r\nHowever i'm sure a lot
  of companies use Frutiger for many things.\r\n\r\nAny help will be appreciated,
  thank you type lovers."

  body: IMO it's the lack of distinct characters and the subtlety, dare one say blandness,
    of the face that provide its personality.

  body: "It\u2019s not simply the blandness of the face, but the way that lack of
    distinction combines with the generous proportions of the forms and counterforms.
    Frutiger is a very airy typeface with huge counters and wide letterspacing; its
    black weight could pass for bold in some families. So it also lends itself to
    great readability in many circumstances."

    is pleasantly bland, unassuming, gentle and well-mannered.\r\nNeutral is nothing
    much of anything. "

  body: "I don\u2019t think Frutiger tries to be neutral. It gives off an unassuming
    warmth that\u2019s perfect for making large organizations seem smaller and less
    impersonal. It\u2019s sort of the Unitarian sans."

    by the Swiss Foundation Type and Typography:\r\n\r\n\"Adrian Frutiger - Typefaces:
    The Complete Works\"\r\n\r\nI guess this must be a very good starting point for
    any research on the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Only when the design fails does it draw attention
    to itself; when it succeeds, it's invisible.\" (John D. Berry)"

    I'd love to see the whole thing.\r\n\r\nRe examples of usage: The <a href=\"http://www.post.ch/en/index.htm\">Swiss
    Post</a> has used Frutiger in its branding for as long as I can remember; in fact,
    every time I see Frutiger Bold, I think mail (which is how I indentify Frutiger!).
    Unfortunately, they don't have a lot of branded PDFs or anything online; <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bild:Swiss-post.svg&filetimestamp=20080131220237\">here</a>
    is their logo, which has actually just recently been tweaked a little, departing
    from the classic Frutiger lettershapes. I think their web site still has the old
    one though.\r\n\r\nGerman Wikipedia lists a whole slew of companies that use Frutiger
    <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger#Verwendung\">here</a> \u2013 ranging
    from the <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bild:Bundeswehr_Logo.svg&filetimestamp=20060916190808\">German
    Army</a> (Bundeswehr) to <a href=\"http://www.ubs.com/\">a certain failed Swiss
    Bank</a> (which combines it with Walbaum in their printed matters) as well as
    <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Ver_di.svg\">Germany's largest (I
    think) trade union</a>.\r\nEnglish Wikipedia also lists <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger#Frutiger_in_Branding\">a
    few</a>."
