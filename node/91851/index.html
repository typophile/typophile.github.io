		<div class="commentbody"><p>No, it is because some type designers know what is best for their <em>typefaces</em>. In many cases, Bold Italic is just too much of a difference from the main face. Why emphasize text in Bold Italic when just a single level of emphasis (e.g., Bold, Italic, small caps, underlining, letterspacing, switching to a different typeface, etc.) would be enough?</p>
<p>There are plenty of typefaces that have Bold Italics. If you want to use a Bold Italic, pick a typeface family that offers it. I don’t see why is should be a requirement, just because it is so commonplace.</p>

<p>If designers want to eschew true cursive italic in favor of slanted Roman, why charge the same price for an oblique as for the Roman, when the difference is a few mouse clicks? Why shouldn&rsquo;t I just buy Roman and let my program create an oblique?</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig, for the example. Apparently some folks need to know why there is a need for BI, although I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought so on Typophile.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Historically, if you go &lsquo;way back, there was just one style of type in a given document. That style might have been blackletter, or it might have been Roman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen printed books from the 20th Century (or maybe the 19th) that actually used blackletter for emphasis in a predominantly Roman text.</p>
<p>Italics, when they first came along, thanks to Aldus Manutilus, were a way to print books more economically.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, the use of italics for emphasis (as opposed to letterspacing for emphasis, a once-common practice) did become standardized.</p>
<p>Boldface came along <em>much</em> later. Using blackletter, or a different Roman typeface with a heavier weight, for emphasis or headings preceded the design of bold weights of a given typeface.</p>
<p>A very few typefaces later had bold italics designed for them, but this was generally regarded as a novelty. The frequent use of different levels of emphasis - italics, bold, small capitals - is generally deprecated, as good taste in typography has been generally regarded as that which is understated.</p>
<p>Victorian posters, of course, are the extreme example of the opposite of this - and the needs of advertisers are one major reason why a few typefaces had a bold italic designed for them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Manutius and Manutilus were two different people, the later being a crazy submarine typographer of the 19th century.</p>
<p>@dan &ldquo;No, it is because some type designers know what is best for their typefaces&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is reasoning for both solutions. If I don&rsquo;t supply a BI I am saying to the user not to use one, if I do supply one I&rsquo;m trying to make sure the computer doesn&rsquo;t supply it.</p>
<p>Back at the original question, bold italic was something that was made in many display faces. Text bold italics were not common in the Linotype library when I arrived in 1978, but by 1986, all families intended for use in text and display use required a BI</p>
<p>What happened was, i think three things;
ITC was producing large, for the time, families of matching roman and italic for each weight. Linotype and maybe others were digitally standardizing on 12 pt masters and at the same time expanding families like Caledonia, Century and Aster w/Ikarus, and while doing so added BI to keep up.</p>
<p>WYSIWYG word processors were starting to catch on that used matching bitmaps for printer and screen fonts. Hand edited bitmaps had the ability to be boldened and slanted without damage being apparent to your average word processor developer. Software logic says R, RI and B should always make BI possible, so font developers were compelled to either see computer generated BI, or supply it.</p>
<p>So when typesetting and word processing merged into desktop publishing, it placed the typographically mindful and mindless on the same platform while converting to digital outlines, and so the BI became expected.</p>
<p>Same with fonts don&rsquo;t have I, B or BI today, like Brush Script&hellip; and look what happens.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Further to David’s exegesis: a big impetus to the concept of large families came about through the technological ability to photographically modify typositor fonts and settings. “Modding”.</p>
<p>Headliners International, for instance, had in the 1970s and 80s small-x height “Neo-Mini- ” versions of all the classic typefaces, including even Gill Sans, in multiple weights, roman and italic (for use in heads, Marc!)</p>
<p>Both slanting and bolding could be done photographically (outlines and shadows too); the results weren’t perfect, but the amount of manual clean-up work required was substantially less than drawing from scratch.</p>
<p>The weight of a typositor setting could be varied during or after the setting process, and the same techniques used in font production.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, high-end typesetters provided hand lettering and typositor-set headlines, as well as body-text galleys. Often a headline setting would be modded and tweaked by lettering artists to the extent that it became a hybrid beast. Les Usherwood ran one such shop in Toronto, Typsettra, and used the technology and talent at his disposal to design and produce many different fonts based on the same modded body, both as stylistic variants (different serif treatments) and as family extensions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There just is not one answer.  In the area of possible need, there are variances between, book, magazine, brochure, advertising, web, etc.., for a given face.  This gets further compounded by a given users perception of what they need vs. what it costs to buy.  Using the same logic, a type designer might ask himself if there would be enough more sales just because the BI was included to more than offset the time and effort to make a BI. Sometimes a type designer might assume that a BI is not worth doing for a given face.  They may well be wrong by some counts but that was there perception at the time.
I you need a BI in a face that does not have one, contact the foundry and ask about it. They may just need a few nudges in that direction to produce that variation.  Otherwise, you may need to choose another face for the job.  I might also say that making a decent BI when a family has  only a bold roman and a regular italic is not just a few quick mouse clicks as someone implied above.  All good things require work.
When you need it, you need it.  That does not mean a type designer may think the time and effort was worth it at the moment of release.  They may change their mind if they get asked often enough.</div>

<p>Don — Depends upon the model of the machine and how many simultaneous magazines it could accommodate. Lino mats were duplexed — i.e., two styles on one mat. So each magazine would carry two styles together (which were, technically speaking, a single font).</p>
<p>Usually the pairings were typical Roman with Italic or Roman with Bold.</p>
<p>Small caps were not provided as a separate font/style. Those faces that sported small caps were usually targeted at book work and were provided in fonts of Roman with Italic and Small Caps. I don’t know offhand exactly what the duplexing scheme was (and there may have been a few different arrangements).</p>
<p>If there was a Bold Italic, it would be offered with the Bold. But there were not a lot of those in the library.</p>
<p>And you could also get certain pairings across families (usually, two romans) — so, for instance, Excelsior with Memphis Bold — for jobbing work.</p>
