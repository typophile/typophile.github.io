  above is a <a href=\"http://upio.com/dev/example\"><strong>working prototype</strong></a>
  that makes reading articles and longer works on the internet more like reading a
  book. Its content (the entire article, or chapter, or book) is loaded from a database
  and the front end presents it as pages in a spread.\r\nThis started out as an experiment
  using baseline grids on the web; then on-screen readability. Over the past couple
  holed-up weeks here at home I dirtied my hands on the emergent technologies of the
  new internet, specifically HTML5's canvas element, CSS3, javascript libraries such
  as Mootools and jQuery, and RSS.\r\n"

    about and downloaded long ago, but never used much).

  body: I see this project potentially plugging into Google Reader, or competing with
    it. I haven't yet determined how the layout engine will handle image scaling,
    cropping and placement, but I'd like to integrate an algorithm that produces interesting
    grid-based results, and allow for human input and correction of the design. One
    feature I'm considering that could appeal to designers is output to PDF in imposed
    signatures, to create booklets.
