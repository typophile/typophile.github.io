  body: He&#39;s there already?! Wow. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I just think it&#39;s too much
    weight on Stephen, the Valkyries bless his soul. It&#39;s like now he <i>has</i>
    to reply to every single ID request &#40;because you can bet he knows 95% of them&#41;.
    Who&#39;s gonna shovel all that nice Swedish snow?  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: You&#39;re both too kind. I&#39;d reply whether I was a <BR>moderator or not.
    Actually, I&#39;m not sure what my <BR>duties as a moderator are.  <BR> <BR>But
    I <i>must</i> identify, regardless of title. Type IDs  <BR>are my sustenance and
    my solace. You wouldn&#39;t  <BR>want me to wither away would you, Hranty?
