  body: My partner, our daughter and I were there a few weeks ago and helped Greg
    (the museum's technical director) with sorting out some type and a few other things.
    It was our third visit. Such a neat place. I definitely would encourage people
    to go see it. I recommend Phil Rohrer's Lunch for lunch.
