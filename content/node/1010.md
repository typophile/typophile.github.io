  wanting to fall right at the beginging of the second line down in an indented paragraph.
  <BR> <BR>Example: <BR> <BR>     &#40;indent&#41;Blah s;ldf;sdflka&#39;a;lkasfjnfoiwenf
  <BR>-- werkwerl;kwerkl;wer;lkwe;. weriowre;iwe <BR>weroewrlkewrjfisdfjflkwlwerj.
  <BR> <BR>This sort of thing. <BR> <BR>Whats your thoughts on this? Bad Good? can
  I get away with it? Its really bothering me quite a lot. <BR> <BR>hildebrant.'

  body: If you don&#39;t want it to start at the line, which I think would look kind
    of awkward, use a soft return after it to force it to start at the end of the
    first line. <BR> <BR>If that still doesn&#39;t work, adjust your tracking a bit.
