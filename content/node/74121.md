  was originally going to do only one italic for Neuton (another thread), however
  I was having two separate directions I wanted to go. A much more sober, perhaps
  \"slanted\" italic, and also a more cursive italic, the likes of Garamond or Caslon
  italic. I broke down and decided to have two. (Probably.)\r\n\r\nHere is the second,
  the first is not quite nice enough to view in the light as yet, because I am completely
  redoing much of it. Make what you can of this, the spacing and some of the letters
  are quite rough, crits very welcome.\r\n\r\nI don't have time to get anything more
  elaborate right now as I have to do some chores."

    Also, how's the <strong>z</strong>? Anything else I can improve?"

    this? I've redone the bowls of the a and d entirely. Flow better? I corrected
    the other issues too. Any thoughts? Other letters also need more help?"

  body: "Here's updated italics, I'll be posting a PDF later. The additional italic
    I'm calling \"cursive\", because of the cursive structure of the letters, not
    because it's connected (it isn't), although I'm wondering if making ligatures
    of some of the letter pairs wont improve the word image. Or maybe make special
    contextual alternates that connect because of their structure, like a running
    script would.\r\n\r\nThe main italic is pretty much a \"slanted\", although the
    lc is completely redrawn. And, I changed the serif shapes a bit.\r\n\r\nItalic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pangram-italic_5861.2012.3.31.png]\r\nCursive:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pangram-cursive_5579.2012.3.31.png]"

  body: "That Cursive is brilliant! Following the tradition from the Renaissance on,
    I would like to see the Caps more upright in the Cursive.\r\n\r\nCursive: \r\n/vw
    ce/ could be slanted a bit more. \r\n/s/ is top heavy, which is not necesarily
    bad, but it could also be a bit more slanted. (Note, slanted doesn't mean 'more
    like the italic'.)\r\n/o/ seems to be upright, because of the white space inside.
    I had the same problem with my own italics. It just needs to be slanted further,
    focusing on the whitespace.\r\n/zero lining/ has same problem as /o/.\r\n/one
    lining/ the two strokes are disconnected by the swashy ink trap.\r\n/z/ is a bit
    too computarized and not enough calligraphic. Look at the italic /z/ in garamond
    and jenson and such.\r\n\r\nItalic: Looks silly next to that wonderful cursive.
    No specific issues, just a lack of cursiveness. I don't like that /x/ but that
    might be just me.\r\n\r\nCheers! jasper\r\n\r\n"

  body: That cursive is nice. I think it could benefit from looser spacing though.
    In 2, 4 and 7, I would try to get some curviness into the horizontals. Look to
    your z for guidance. I agree with jasper re o and s. y and g are nice and quirky.
    I'd make the exclamation mark curve away from the sentence rather than into it
    - i.e. Unslant it, reflect it and reslant it.
