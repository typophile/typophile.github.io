body: "Hi\r\nMaking a logo for a medical centre named \"Legenes Legesenter\" (it is
  close to the real name). Initials are \"LL\". The sketch illustrates how I ended
  up with the symbol at the bottom right. It contains one positive and one negative
  \"L\", and a heart. Not sure if this is the best solution? I like some of the \"calligraphic\"
  shapes but they tend to look like eyes, mouths etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brainstorm_6395.gif]\r\n\r\nNow
  I am searching for a \"medical\" font that fits this symbol. If anyone has a suggestion
  I'll be happy to try it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/legesenter_3575.gif]"

  body: "Oops. I meant to add that the mark itself is nice, but you might want to
    reconsider the rest.\r\n\r\nCrud. I also want to say I did like the simplicity
    of the first although the L was a little abnormally shaped. Like a short man with
    big feet.\r\n\r\nDoes the heart in the new mark have to be closed. In your sketches,
    at the top on the far right, that implies a heart without being blunt."

    do not have Starbucks im my part of the world and the medical centre is local.
    I did not know the Starbucks logo myself, honestly. I'll see what I can do about
    it.\r\n\r\nI'll try to open up the heart in the mark and get some longer legs
    on the \"L\", thanks for noticing.  \r\n"

  body: "I love the heart/stethoscope mark. The gradients dull the contrast in your
    logo, and make it look less clean - I'd get rid of them.\r\n\r\nI really like
    the reversed version - it looks much cleaner and appropriate for a medical centre
    than the top example. I think it could work on white if you just removed the outermost
    stroke. I'd also remove the black stroke around the centre circle to make it less
    busy.\r\n\r\nThe green colour really evokes Starbucks to me. I'd go with blue
    instead. Try to work in some red or pink into the mark - maybe just in the small
    circle within the heart.\r\n\r\nOverall, great work.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Tried to open the heart as Miss Tiffany suggested, I was afraid to get a
    face with two angry eyebrows but I think it works better now? More stethoscopic
    without loosing the heart. Thanks again for seeing that.\r\n\r\nHi Lex, thanks
    for commenting. Removing excess decorations seems like a good idea. I am not shure
    about the outermoust circle, I think it looks a bit ragged without it?\r\nTried
    some blue and red as you suggested, good call, well appreaciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/legesenter5_4541.gif]"

    your explanation right away. I see what you mean now. \r\nHere it is with one,
    two and three circles. \r\nLooking into the weights of the symbol, it is becomming
    almost like a glyph to me. Maybe I could find a font that looks related to the
