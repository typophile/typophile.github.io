  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Due to Calibri replacing Arial as MS Word's default, it is no doubt soon to be as omnipresent as the aforementioned.

However as it, along with the other ClearType typefaces, do seem to be optimised for screen, what are your thoughts on the suitability of the typeface in a printed environment?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Not suitable.

I was asked to use it for a book, and although I recommended against it based on prior experience (*) the client "really really liked it on screen". In print, the letter is just way too fat to comfortably read.

(*) This prior experience includes using Verdana for print, using Arial for print, using Tahoma for print, and using Times New Roman for print. The common denominator here is <em>not</em>, let me repeat <em>not</em>, that they are Microsoft fonts "and thus bad", but they were all designed, hinted, and optimized for the screen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">However, Microsoft does seem to be a serial offender in not providing full families for its typefaces.
The hoary "four styles is a family" mantra, don't cha know.

For sans faces, type foundries generally provide their clients with a range of weights, from Hairline to Black.
For serif faces, type foundries often provide both text and display fonts: media-specific alternates.

But there is still no Georgia Display, no Verdana Light.

Would it not be possible, when a Light weight is rendered at small size on screen, to change the font?
After all, "ForceBold" has addressed this kind of issue, via creative engineering, from the early days of PostScript.

<img src="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/7003/screenshot20110729at929.png">

Does that mean that Myriad and Frutiger are in their regular weight to bold to be printed too?
Or do the fonts for some reason render differently on screen than they are interpreted by a printer?

Just want to understand the issue and the recommendation from somebody who is knowledgeable about that.

I guess in a professional environment you printed offset? Is the same assessment true for laser or ink printing?

		<div class="commentbody">I think that, if you take care about point size, Georgia works perfectly in print.
I have seen it used, in many sizes, even in small magazines.

@Nick: If you use Miller, it’s perfectly compatible with Georgia. Before purchasing Miller Text, I tried by purchasing Miller Text Small Caps only, to compensate for Georgia’s lack of Small Caps, and – with a slight point size adjustment – it worked very good both in trials I was doing for eBooks and in laser printed copies.

Hey, we’re talking of Matthew Carter. It’s practically impossible to have a "not stellar" typeface from him… :)</div>
