  body: Wow. I never would have thought of using that typeface for that type of magazine.
    Definitely not Bodoni.

  body: The way they combine Carousel with Avant Garde (and Lubalin Graph on the international
    edition) gives the covers a nice late-'60s, early-'70s feel.

  body: Naw, just the comment, but because it was an old thread it jumped back in
    time to its last comment. You'll have to trawl back a good number of pages before
    you'll find it.
