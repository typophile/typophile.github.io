    month. It has an ampersand worthy of worship. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: How new is new? <BR> <BR>Brioso Pro and Sava Pro both shipped from Adobe within
    the last six months. Although both are historically inspired, neither is a revival.

  body: '&#62;How new is new? <BR> <BR>What I am interested in is primarily typefaces
    based on original ideas, designed within the last decade, eg Base. <BR> <BR>Stuff
    that ain&#39;t retro --- suitable for the 21st century. Or any other century,
    but in a parallel universe &#40;eg Dalliance, or as Tiffany suggested, Sebastian&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The deconstructed &#34;New Typography&#34; era is over, so what does
    &#34;new&#34; mean now? <BR>'

    script to this list. Freakin&#39; gorgeous it is. Plus, any or all of the recent
    spate of decorative pixel fonts by <a href="http://www.atomicmedia.net/hernandez.php">Migual
    Hernandez</a> and <a href="http://www.awkwerd.com/">Dave Chau</a>. Werd.

  body: Hmm. How about Amplitude &#40;Font Bureau&#41; or The Shag Collection &#40;House
    Industries&#41; or Gotham &#40;Hoefler Type Foundry&#41; or Priori &#40;Emigre&#41;
    or Aspect &#40;Tankard&#41; or Alexey, ApexSans, Commodity and Orbit &#40;Thirstype&#41;.
    I suppose it depends upon &#34;how new is new?&#34; I don&#39;t have release dates
    on these, but maybe they count? [Sorry too lazy to make links.]
