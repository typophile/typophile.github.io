		<div class="commentbody">It's nice, Eduardo. I suppose that you're aware of     <BR>Peter Verheul's Newberlin, that also uses straight lines     <BR>only. But I find your Maest more interesting. I agree     <BR>that there's a crispness in the lc that the UC is     <BR>lacking somewhat. Some of its characters could be a bit     <BR>narrower, the bowls of P and R a little smaller.    <BR>    <BR>I'm not sure whether the sort of variation in the spacing     <BR>rhythm that you have here was intentional or not. For     <BR>instance: how letters seem to coalesce in 'qua', only to     <BR>disperse again in 'scele' (and especially in 'ss' ;). This     <BR>&quot;elastic&quot; behaviour may bother some people (not me).    <BR>    <BR>One possible problem that I see is that in smaller settings     <BR>the 'n' could be mistaken for an 'u'. Also, there may be     <BR>a problem in certain cases with the gap created by     <BR>the 'c' in some combinations (like ci, ct). But generally     <BR>it will work, I think.    <BR>    <BR>abra</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice. I enjoy the irregularity and think it too many of the characters conformed to the same rules it wouldn't have the same flavor at all. If anything I would think it would be good to have alternates for the characters so that the user could keep this irregularity more consistant. For instance in your paragraph it seems that some of the words have the first few character aligned on the baseline and then the last few fall off. It might be nicer if there really was a consistant up and down or at least irregualar action/flow of line.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; The key word here is readers. <BR> <BR>Well, agreed. But readers (which I prefer to call &quot;users&quot;, since there's more to communication than reading) don't design their own stuff. Designers do that for them. And the point is that a real designer is not an artist because an artist's main motivation is self-expression. That doesn't mean there's no art in design - not at all. In fact there is unavoidably art in anything a human does - which is a good thing. The main difference between Art and Craft is <i>motivation</i>. <BR> <BR>Testing is exactly something that a designer needs to do but an artists will not. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Senna put harder compound tires on the left than on the right, because the track was mostly right turns&hellip; And he won (of course). Senna was different. That Donnington wet race in '93 was just alien. Anyway, the extreme technical aspect gets me. Which is why I never watch Indy racing (or whatever it's called now): it's 19th century tug-boat racing. <BR> <BR>Plus, once you go to an actual race (my first was in '90) it becomes just out of this world. A friend had brought a camcorder, and it stopped working from the noise vibrations. <BR> <BR>I have autographs of Prost, Hakkinen and Wendlinger (don't ask), and I've come within 3 yards of Senna, after he won in Monaco in '93 - that was a miraculous race.

		<div class="commentbody">Eduardo,  <BR>  <BR>With all this  discussiou oops&hellip;  discussio<i><b>n</b></i> over the &quot;n&quot;.   <BR>No one commented on your second PDF - the one   <BR>with other versions or stages that your design  <BR>has seen.  <BR>  <BR>I think the caps in 2 are great! For me, they   <BR>really add to the rhythm. Look at the &quot;M&quot; in   <BR>&quot;Midas&quot; for instance. In 2 it flows really nice.   <BR>While in 4, I sort of pause when I reach it. I am  <BR>not saying 4 is is not pretty I just think 2 might   <BR>be a bit more consistent in expressing the   <BR>personality of Maest. But it really depends on what <BR>your goals are. I think you mentioned that you were  <BR>really trying to be disciplined in your design.  <BR>I say loosen up a bit and let the type face design  <BR>itself just a little bit more. <BR>  <BR>You could take 2 even further and create   <BR>swash characters as an addition. That would   <BR>be really cool! In addition this could help to  <BR>separate it even further from the designs that  <BR>where mentioned earlier. <BR> <BR>But then again 2 will raise even more legibility issues. <BR>Do the &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; look too much alike? And then you <BR>have the whole &quot;n&quot; story all over again. What a story it told. <BR> <BR>I think that UC &quot;U&quot; would look cool and be more calligraphic  <BR>with a stem coming down the on the right. Like a LC. <BR>  <BR>Thanks for posting your second PDF. I really   <BR>like it.  <BR>  <BR>-smc</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thank you, sean. <BR> <BR>I think the &quot;M&quot; in 02 is very nice too, but the hardest thing is <BR>to make the other Uc characters coherent with it. Frankly, I <BR>don't have any idea of how to do it. Btw, that's the same  <BR>problem in 04. <BR>For example, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; just don't get along. It seems like &quot;A&quot; is <BR>one font, and &quot;B&quot; is another. I think the same thing happens with <BR>other &quot;round&quot; characters, as &quot;B&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. I just need <BR>to spend more time on this. <BR> <BR>But I liked your idea of making swash characters. I'll see what <BR>I can do. ;)</div>
