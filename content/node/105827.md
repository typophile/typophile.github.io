  body: "Even with a [[https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1977757971/logo_-_white.jpg|bigger
    sample]], I was not able to to identify it. It'd rather look like a chop-off job
    on some extended sans to me.\r\nIf I have to reproduce it, I'd probably start
    with some extended sans like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/presicav|Presicav]]
    Light, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic|Trade Gothic]] Extended
    Light, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/range-gothic|Range Gothic]] Light
    (or even [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica|Helvetica Neue]]
    Extended Light plus some more adjustments on /c and /e terminals) chopping off
    some vertical stems. [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Glen_Jan|Glen Jan]] Elena
    Kowalski [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glen-jan/echoes-sans|Echoe Sans]] and
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glen-jan/affect|Affect]] would also be some interesting
    candidates to work with."

  body: now that you've mentioned it, i think it's just presicav photoshopped (with
    the 'a' rotated a bit counter clockwise). thanks :D
