  the glyphs were made in illustrator, and now I'm having some problem after I designed
  200 glyphs now.\r\n\r\nI've created some ligatures, that I could not find in any
  places on the internet, like \"tt\" or \"ll\" or \"Ft\" (with capital F).\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone knows what their unicode is? Or does they even exist?\r\nIf not, then how
  can I implement them into my font? Is there unicodes, which are empty for this kind
  of porpose?\r\n\r\nThanks for the advices!"
