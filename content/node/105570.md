body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI did something unintentionally, while I was sorting my glyphs,
  anyway - my tools are all grey/translucent now and I can't change a single thing.
  \"erase tool\" is grey, \"knife tool\" is grey, \"elipse\" - everything. I basically
  can't select any of the tools, nor a single dot when I open glyph window and I don't
  know how to undo what I just did. I quit and restart, but the problem remains.\r\nI
  attached a snapshot.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help! "
