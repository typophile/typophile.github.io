body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>this logo is for a music video website - an online place where
  upcoming artists and talented individuals can upload their music videos to promote
  themselves. <BR> <BR>target group is somewhere below 30. I tried to create a hip
  logo with a fresh and funky feel to it.  <BR>I&#39;m not sure to sure about the
  type - do the shape &#40;TV&#43; &#34;what&#39;s hot&#34;&#41; and colours work?

  body: The colors work. I don&#39;t see a TV, nor hot, though. And grunge typewriter
    isn&#39;t really &#39;hip&#39; these days. <BR> <BR>Where did the term &#39;fudge&#39;
    come from? Perhaps play off that? <BR> <BR>Distill/simplify a bit more and see
    what that produces.

  body: thanks for your comments!  <BR> <BR>I would look to continue working with
    the TV concept a little since the clients likes that. I have simplified the logo
    now a little and also made some changes to the script. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42972.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>any feedback on that?

  body: It looks a little more current, but now I&#39;m seeing a Marshall&#39;s or
    TJ Max handbag company, or maybe a logo for a new French toasted bagel product
    at the corner coffee shop. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not getting anything related to music
    or its promotion. The fudge name works because of its quirkiness, which is what
    I would try to play off of. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'This is certainly a lot better, but, yea, I guess I agree with Scott...still
    not quite the right target. <BR> <BR>BTW, is there a domain name for this &#40;fudge.tv&#41;?
    If not, then I&#39;d probably loose the dot-thing. You wouldn&#39;t want fudge.tv
    taken up by a porn site down the road or something. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>OK...one
    idea...melted &#40;&#39;hot&#39;&#41; fudge? Fudge dripping over a TV? Piece of
    fudge wrapped in a fudge TV wrapper? '

  body: Scott I almost wrote something identical &#40;I mean the same&#41; but the
    recognized your posting before posting myself, thankfully.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    want to start a discussion if being hip is the right starting point for a logo
    or generally for a business. This mostly has only short reach. &#40;I mean being
    hip in first place&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be going much more in the music direction.
    The TV interpretation does not hit the point for me. <BR>Music Videos are much
    more about music than about video. So maybe try something referring to music and
    singing. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR> <BR> <BR>
