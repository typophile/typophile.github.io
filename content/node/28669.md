  is the logo for Canada's largest outdoor gear store, Mountain Equipment Co-op or

  body: "Looks like you are right, <strong>barthak</strong>, thank you very much.
    :)\r\n\r\n<strong>Lex</strong>, are you sure about that? If yes, do you know where
    I could find a copy of the old logo?\r\n\r\nThis is an excerpt from the MEC Annual
    General Meeting of 2006 which is where I based my information from, but it is
    pretty vague, and it could be mistaken:\r\n\r\n\"Steven Brown was the gentleman
    who developed the logo that has been in use since the time that he developed it.
    I think it was about 1974, and I just wanted to acknowledge him.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://images.mec.ca/media/Images/pdf/MEC_2006_AGM_Transcript_v1_m56577569830602539.pdf"
