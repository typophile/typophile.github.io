  I am putting together an english/spanish package and I am concerned not only that
  separating languages by color could be overkill, but that some people might find
  it insulting. '

  body: "Most of us are used to reading these kinds of packages. Pick up any shampoo
    bottle and tell me how much you get inundated with superfluous French. Most bottles
    have French mixed in with English in the ingredient list. Some have French in
    slightly smaller type than English in the small paragraphs that describe how your
    hair will flail and whip like the mane of horse.\r\n\r\nIf its medical then by
    all means make distinct zones. Otherwise... I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "In Europe most packages have the fine print in the same font/size/style,
    with enclosed country/language codes for quick scanning.  The main logo/front
    design will be primarily in one or two languages.  So for example a Portuguese
    company might have:\r\n\r\n<em>apple juice | apfelsaft | \u0639\u0635\u064A\u0631
    \u0627\u0644\u062A\u0641\u0627\u062D\r\n<strong>SUCO DE MA\xC7\xC3\r\nZUMO DE
    MANZANA</strong>\r\njus de pomme | succo di mele | \u044F\u0431\u043B\u043E\u0447\u043D\u044B\u0439
    \u0441\u043E\u043A</em>\r\n\r\nWith the bold capital text in display face, coloured
    etc, with the parenthetised text in a sans font.  The ingredients would then go:\r\n\r\n<strong>(P)</strong>
    Agua, ma\xE7\xE3es\r\n<strong>(E)</strong> Agua, manzanas\r\n<strong>(GB/IE)</strong>
    Water, apples\r\n<strong>(D/A)</strong> Wasser, \xC4pfel\r\n\r\nI would upload
    a picture of a package like this, but I don't move to Europe for another two weeks
    and I can't seem to find a picture already online.\r\n\r\nBut I agree with Mike,
    most people in the US are used to reading packages bilingually and trilingually
    after NAFTA.  The one thing to be careful about is market regulations.  I want
    to say that in Quebec the French has to be within X size of the English.  (Actually,
    I'm almost 100% sure of such a regulation, I just don't recall the details).  You
    said this is English/Spanish, and I don't think Mexico has a similar law, so you
    could either do equal treatment of the two (often by doing the front in English
    and the back identical to the front in Spanish) for products equally destined
    for the US and Mexico, or a subordination of the Spanish, assuming a product destined
    for a generally English speaking public.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea
