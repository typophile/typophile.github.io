body: "Hello guys,\r\n\r\nI'm again looking for a calligrapher to help us out on writing
  a small word for a wine bottle (important: it's variety name, not the brand).\r\nWe
  are looking for some things similar to the images attached.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested,
  please send me your website, or samples of your work to:\r\nnuno AT lateralbranding
  DOT com & hellonuno AT gmail DOT com (we are having problems with the studios server)\r\n\r\nIf
  you for some reason don't have any sample of your work similar to the sample I'm
  asking for, you can also e-mail me the word \"Jiarez\". Don't worry this is not
  the word we need, it's just similar in form.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to say proximately
  how much you would charge for this work, if you are selected, we will give you every
  detail about the project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)"

    people of the forum. The other time I looked for a calligrapher here at typophile
    I really got some good contacts, but I'm now working on another studio and didn't
    backed up my e-mails... oops."

    probably the guy you want. I can vouch for his work and professional approach
    as well because i sent him the job you referenced as a freelance assignment.\r\n\r\nhttp://stephenrapp.com/\r\nStephen"
