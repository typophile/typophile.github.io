  for a job and the client loves it, problem is they keep editing the text and I'm
  getting tired of rewriting it.\r\n\r\nIs there a relatively inexpensive software
  that easily digitize handwriting? I don't need a full character set, just upper
  and lower case and punctuation. \r\n\r\nOr is there someone here who has experience
  doing this? If you are interested, contact me through my page here. I'd need this
  done fairly quickly, as in the next week or so.\r\n\r\nI'm also attaching a jpeg
  of my writing if anybody can think of a font that could reasonably approximate it
  and is not wildly expensive.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I have a font that was made from the AD's handwriting for a mutual client
    by a Finnish type designer (I heard her name once, but forgot it, typical!). It's
    an Open type font, with alternates like Hj, kk, os, st, aa, ta, ll, etc. I don't
    know how long it took her to design it, but it works very nicely and looks quite
    realistic.

    (or is it per letter). You might not mind redoing it at $2 a word."

  body: "Yeah, the reason I didn't originally look for a handwriting font was because
    I wanted the personal touches - ligatures, etc. But I'm foreseeing them driving
    me crazy with changes and edits.\r\n\r\nLari, I just looked at that link, looks
    way over my head and I don't have the other software you have to have. But thanks.\r\n\r\nDon
    - you're right, of course. Problem is I kind of backed into it - my handwriting
    was just supposed to be a stand-in but now they want to use it."

  body: "Well, I bought \"Eigen Handschrift Lettertype\" (My own handwriting) for
    \u20AC10,-, but it demands a lot of finetuning afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnother option
    might be \"My Font Tool for Tablet PC\" although it's said it only works on Tablet
    PC's, once extracted from the *.MSI file (using 'LessMSIerables') you can run
    the programm and create a font by using a tablet... No OpenType in theze lowbudget-solutions.
