body: 'Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m redesigning a printed ballot for the Vancouver municipal
  elections as part of my communication design senior project at ECIAD. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  looking for something with some or all of the following characteristics: <BR> <BR>-
  high short-burst legibility <BR>- family of weights, widths if possible <BR>- letter-forms
  with visible differences from character to character to help with dyslexic/ESL reading
  <BR>  &#40;opposite of prokyon, univers, helvetica?&#41; <BR>- confidence with a
  little character and warmth <BR>- contemporary feeling <BR>- good optical characteristics
  at various sizes <BR>- efficient character count &#40;high x-height &amp; condensed
  available?&#41; <BR>- perhaps suitable for voting instructions, signage, etc <BR>
  <BR>A lot to ask, I know. The final choice will obviously be a compromise on one
  area vs. another. All suggestions of any kind are greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thanks
  very much.'

  body: I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find anything that is specifically well optimized
    for dyslexic/non-Latin readers, which also comes in a large family of weights
    and widths. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also note that legibility and efficient character
    count &#40;including condensed widths&#41; are largely opposed to each other.
    Newspaper text faces try to walk that line, but they are also optimized for small
    sizes and don&#39;t meet the rest of your needs. <BR> <BR>Overall, I&#39;m thinking
    something in the same general design space as Myriad or Frutiger would seem best
    suited to the job. Humanist sans, pretty legible, available in a wide range of
    weights and widths. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    I would have a look at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/"

  body: "Rrrrrr. <BR> <BR>Resist the impulse to default to sans. I still say Trinit\xE9.
    It has the condensed and extended widths you require, it has the  multiple available
    extender lengths you require, it&#39;s superbly legible, it certainly fills your
    need for &#34;confidence with a little character and warmth,&#34; need I go on?
    <BR> <BR>Other TEFF fonts are designed in similarly versatile ways &#40;see also
    Lexicon.&#41; The closest Adobe font I can think of is Kepler. Many would dismiss
    it because of its modern serif tendencies, but I think it&#39;s a fine and versatile
    design, perfectly legible, and certainly not overexposed. <BR> <BR>Step away from
    the sans!"

    see what&#39;s wrong with &#34;defaulting to a sans&#34; here. Especially when
    one is dealing with short tracts of texts, sans serifs can be highly useful.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m not saying that a sans <b>must</b> be used here, but I think that
    it would be silly to rule them out per some sort of dogma. <BR> <BR>Here are just
    some suggestions of humanist sans serifs, with condensed as well as regular weights:

    <BR> <BR>Linotype Vialog &#40;this is a slightly narrow face, it has no regular
    or condensed, but a ton of weights. Originally designed as a signage family, its
    characters are very easily distinguished from another&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/53981/vialog-family.html"

  body: 'Generally I don&#39;t like sans fonts, but for careful, deliberate reading
    at small sizes they&#39;re better than serif fonts. The problem is <i>most</i>
    sans fonts are more modular &#40;hence more ambiguous&#41; than the typical serif
    face. I think the ideal here would be a sans that&#39;s &#34;quirky&#34; - in
    the right ways though. One font I might recommend is Burke&#39;s Pragma&#42;.
    And if you go with sans, maybe his FF Parable. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.hiberniatype.com/Pragma/pragma.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.hiberniatype.com/Pragma/pragma.html</a> <BR> <BR>Also,
    stay away from highly chirographic&#42; fonts: although they&#39;re not as bad
    as geometrically constructed designs, they&#39;re still too formally modular -
    it&#39;s just a less obvious modularity. Look at the b/d/p/q in your average chirographic
    font: the bowls are too similar. Good for aesthetic harmony, bad for reading.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Which is a term meaning a design that exhibits the vestiges of
    handwriting/calligraphy. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'This may sound obvious, but i do know my faces pretty well: <BR> <BR>that
    description sounds like the brief for FF Meta, when i first designed it for the
    German post office as PT 55 back in 1985. It now even has a condensed version,
    and it was designed for very small sizes on bad paper with low-res typesetting.
    It&#39;s human, it&#39;s warm, it&#39;s a Sans. OK, it&#39;s overused, but aren&#39;t
    the Frutigers and Myriads even more so?'

    Meta as the most obvious choices. Mr. Spiekermann you were right on target with
    the suggestion of Meta. Thank you for posting. <BR> <BR>As far as sans serif vs.
    serif, I think a mild slab-serif might have use - eg. de Groot\u2019s TheMix.
    I think true serif faces may be too delicate and not representative of Vancouver.
