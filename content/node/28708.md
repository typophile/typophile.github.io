  body: "It's nice, but not sure if it's spectacular. I'd have to see it in context
    on the cover of the magazine to say for sure. The space between \"of\" and \"Photography\"
    could stand to be widened. At the bottom it looks fine, but at the top it's a
    little tight. Maybe split the difference.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: You might consider amping up the contrast in size and weight. It would be
    quite dramatic to have 8x10 quite large and the subline much smaller and subtle.

    \ copule or several covers. So,  right now -- the font isn't important."

    But, then again, I'm envisioning a glossy photography magazine showing only the
    best work.

    baseline enough?

  body: "Here's an updated versions. Unfortunately this face doesn't have a \xD7 character.
    This one is just a plus sign flipped on it's side, I'm trying to decide if that
    makes it a little more interesting (since it isn't a \xD7) or just makes it look
    like bad design. \r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out the 0 not overlapping enough.
    It matches the 8, so I think it's an illusion caused by the massive serif on 1.
    I'll probably scale the 0 up a tiny bit. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8x10logob_5240.png]"
