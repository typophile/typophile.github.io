  body: Trooper Roman. I don't know that there is a legitimate digital version of
    this predigital font available. I DO know that Bill Troop recently <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/busted/"
    target="_blank">released a font</a> under the Canada Type label. I'm hopeful that
    the Trooper family will be digitized and released before long.

  body: "The old FontBank font [[http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/talon.htm|Talon
    Bold]] is a version which appears to differ only in the stress of the 'O' and
    'o', the latter being an alternate form in the version shown in the Phil's Photo
    book, as is the g and y of your sample. Mike's choice of the word 'legitimate'
    makes me hesitate, but I don't know that just because the name Trooper was avoided,
    that this might not have been a legal 'revival' of a non-digital typeface. For
    that matter, MyFonts is selling [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/toledo/bold/|Toledo
    Bold]], plus a number of other weights. These TypeShop fonts are from the Brendel
    Studio (a.k.a. Quick Brown Fox), if I am not mistaken, which has often been a
    source of re-named revivals of pre-digital designs. I would rather not say much
    about the 'legitimate' status of these, as it still is a gray area in my mind.\r\n\r\n

  body: Mike, there's an even closer digital version out there, but my hesitation
    comes with the appearance of Bill Troop on the digital font scene. It seems odd
    (and disappoints me) that his first effort would be a grunge font. Hopefully,
    copyright restrictions won't come in the way of Trooper being eventually offered
    by the classy, top notch Canada Type.

  body: "Yes, I'd be all for that, and I agree about Canada Type being a classy operation.
    Patrick Griffin and Rebecca Alaccari have been very generous in helping with fonts
    and samples for my Guides, and Patrick has always been very forthright about the
    origins of their designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Mike - Where do you read that there's any connection between Bill Troop and
    Trooper Roman? As posted <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/7123">here</a>,
    it was designed by Dave Trooper for VGC.

  body: "Ugh, I'm a dolt. Thanks for straightening that stupid mistake out, Stephen.\r\n\r\nWith
    that in mind, the other version I'm aware of is Paratype's <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Troover.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Troover</a>, which has, I believe, the desired o/O. Unfortunately,
    the Paratype website isn't functioning properly right now, so I can't link to
    a better showing.\r\n\r\nThe o/O in Talon, by the way, were alternates in the
    original Trooper Roman."
