  name is monolinea, which means &#34;one line&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I found a great font
  Alusine by Jack Usine, which fits the concept perfectly and am working at customizing
  it a bit. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far, basically making changes to the  &#34;i&#34;
  in the first line, and the &#34;r&#34; and &#34;V&#34; in the second, but I&#39;m
  not sure it&#39;s working to well. Any critiques, suggestions or comments would
  be welcome.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/69252.gif"

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>That darn S is too flashy, i agree, but cool
    too. makes me wish the name was &#34;monolineas&#34;. <BR> <BR>Mu idea with the
    flourishes was to tweak them so they can connect to lines on both ends, but i&#39;ve
    only gotten so far. <BR> <BR>My main concern with the letterforms for now is the
    r-a union i&#39;ve tried several option, and while this was the best in my opinion,
    i&#39;m not really convinced...

  body: It&#39;s fun, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good idea to use that font
    beyond &#34;monolinea&#34;. It&#39;s very busy, and difficult to read all of it
    together. I&#39;d consider either dropping the second line completely &#40;as
    part of the logo anyway&#41;, or using a more simple face. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: '&#39;Monolinea&#39; means more &#39;single line&#39; than &#39;one line&#39;
    to me. <BR>I line up with Scott Keawekane about using Alusine only in <BR>the
    top line.  I also would consider redesign Alusine lc &#39;a&#39; <BR>comb and
    get rid of / change the two side curly strokes. <BR> <BR>Monochao ! <BR>AS'

  body: Hey kemie, <BR>I like the lettering for monolinea, however my advice is to
    use a plain font for &#34;diseno interactivo&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Using the same typeface
    for all words lessens the impact of the name &#40;monolinea&#41;. <BR> <BR>You
    can try some sans serif in all capitals for example.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/69285.gif"

  body: '&#39;Mono&#39; gives the idea of a closd set, like an oval. <BR>The oval
    is not one oval, but several shapes of ovals. <BR>   If you say &#39;mono-oval&#39;
    can be that you use _only_ that <BR>kind of oval -- jus tlike typography means
    that you write <BR>with types of letters.  One font is not a mono-font. <BR>  Monospaced
    font are not called onespaced font. <BR> <BR>&#39;Egg&#39; in Finnish is &#39;muna&#39;
    but if you start counting them <BR>it is &#39;munaa&#39; the word.  Not sure about
    this neuron. <BR> <BR>Mono- is the first element of composed Greek root words,
    <BR>or modern genesis ones, from Greek &#39;monos,&#39; &#39;single - made <BR>by
    only one.&#39;  &#39;One&#39; remains more abstract, just like you <BR>can write
    &#39;one&#39; or &#39;1&#39; and in the font, numbers are called &#39;figures&#39;.

  body: 'Hi Kemie, <BR> <BR>Two thoughts: <BR>1. The e/a combination is awkward. Considere
    drawing a single storey a and connecting the e to it like the m/o combination.
    I think it will match the feel of the other letters better. You might also consider
    a small cap E form. The overbite might be less awkward. <BR>2. The off-center
    diseno interactivo seems odd because of the symmetry of the end swashes &#40;which
    I like alot!&#41; I&#39;d get rid of these words all together if it was me. <BR>3.
    What other monolinea ideas have you explored? How about a connecting script or
    brush script. How about connections more like Process Lingua? Or a rounded version
    of lingua if that suits your style better. What about a sharpie drawn Bickham?
    Monoline has so many possibilites! <BR> <BR>Also, be sure to do a pixel-perfect
    &#40;hand hinted&#41; version at the small size you will use it online. In other
    words, make the thins exactly 1 pixel, the white space 1 pixel, and the stems
    7 pixels &#40;or whatever makes sense&#41;. This could look very cool methinks.

    and &#34;linea&#34; becomes more obvious. This looks really cool though, and I
    love the flourishes.

    <BR> <BR>Yea, I&#39;d say that the last small sample didn&#39;t hold up at all...at
    least in terms of the line. The wordmark is still quite readable, though, so maybe
    that&#39;s OK.'

  body: I like your &#34;latest attempt&#34;. To Darrel&#39;s point, the continuous
    line within the word disappears some, but I think the flourishes look even better.
    At a smaller size they take on more of an organic feel
