  body: "I think you have gone overboard with the glow and stars, given the name and
    use I would look at a more casual script like\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/bello/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/kari/\r\n\r\nor
    pare down the effects and use your original face maybe with an outline. The ball
    needs to show all the black panels like this\r\nhttp://guide.theemiratesnetwork.com/living/images/soccer%20ball%202.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    would also look at the relationship of the three elements\r\nPlace\r\nName\r\nImage\r\nat
    the moment they are each fighting for prominence\r\nTim"

  body: Thank you for your comments.  I wanted to keep it playful and the fonts you
    suggested seem to be just that.  I will tweak my design and see what I can come
    up with.  Thanks again.

  body: "I think your metaphor for dreaming of football is in one way too subtle and
    in another interfering with the readability of the image as that. If you wanted
    to push it you could go for a cartoon-style thought bubble containing a football,
    an alternative direction might be to lose the direct reference to football and
    use a script. I am not at all keen on the type treatment, I would try using a
    single typeface and not distorting it.\r\nTim"
