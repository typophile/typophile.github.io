  body: "The font is called <strong>Janie HMK</strong> by Hallmark Design Collection
    (your sample is a bit back-slanted).\r\nYou can see a sample here:\r\nhttp://www.dasauge.co.uk/fonts/janie-hmk/?system=0&staerke=7\r\nI
    can't find any legitimate site to acquire it (although Linotype offered this font
    in the past).\r\n"
