  with five major styles and more variants then you would probably want to shake a
  stick at. The face has grown into an eclectic mix of circular counters and jagged
  stems with a pleasant color.\r\n\r\nI would love to get some press, even more preferably,
  the good kind! If you do reviews, and would like to tackle this one,  drop me a
  line (choz at exclamachine). If you are a legit reviewer(and I'll probably know
  who you are), I'll send you the full collection of thirty-five fonts, specimens
  and such.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe completion party is at my house tonight here in
  Nashville. A few friends are coming over to see what this \"big-deal font thing\"
  is.\r\n"

  body: "James: Thank you very much. Because I feel this sits somewhere a basic display
    set and wildly over-themed decorative face, I was really not sure what sort of
    reaction it would get. After the pdbq set, which I love, my personal faves are
    the g, m and 0.\r\n\r\nThe 'a'which connects wherever it looks better, was quite
    a challenge. If I knew how much work it would be to make it behave, I probably
    would have skipped the hundreds of manual kerns it required. Now that it is done
    I tihnk it may now be the most subtle quality offered.\r\n\r\nThe sliced variant
    is my favorite too! To get the effect I used Adam's fontlab filters to do vertical
    slices (after rotating) and then hand snipped and Tweak. Lots of zooming involved.\r\n\r\nI
    found it was impossible to get the slices to look good at both large and small
    sizes, so I went with \"big\". One goal was to make sure it held up on the same
    page as Carved, Celerite or other heavier fonts.\r\n\r\nEben:\r\nMy original vision
    was large, busting off the page, tight spaced applications, like titling for posters
    and such. Since developing !Lestatic: Specimens, I am most currently fond of the
    treatment of The Lashed cut, and see a lot of potential for that look, which feels
    to me, both modern yet with a historical ambiance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I really
    like very long single line strings of text. The relation ships of all the vertical
    marks (Descender/Cap height/xheight, etc.)really suits this, I feel.  There is
    a certain pattern of black and white that appears that works; I might be biased,
    but hey, I've looked at it a lot. :)\r\n\r\nI predict that one style may get used
    for headlines and another for callouts. In the hard copy specimen, I have a spread
    that explores layers of stacked text in different variants.\r\n"

    saw it I immediately started thinking of two applications; the first being reprints
    of romantic poetry as the fonts would be perfect for editions illustrated with
    classic woodcuts\u2014I would love to pair this fonts with Dore\u2019s illustrations
    for a new release of <em>The Ancient Mariner</em>. I also think it would go well
    in a variety of fantasy literature and gaming publications, particularly medieval,
    steampunk, and gaslight settings. "

    Or are you ribbing us? It does seem suited to fantasy stuff & games though. I
    agree with you there.
