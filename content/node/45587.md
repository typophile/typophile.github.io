  body: The word 'studeum' I am guessing is pronounced stew-dee-um. It kinda sounds
    like student to me which immediately made me think of it as an amateur company.

  body: "Agreed. My first thought upon first glance was student. \r\n\r\nAny backstory
    to go with the name? Perhaps we could help focus it a bit?"

  body: "Well, in Latin, \"studium\" means \"eagerness\" or \"zeal.\"  Studium could
    have associations with studio, study, or student.  But Studeum, because of the
    'e,' has too strong of an association with \"student\" to mean much else.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick
