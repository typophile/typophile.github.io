  body: "I don't think this was based on a pre-existing font. The p's are just inverted
    d's. The line weight and end strokes are inconsistent. The G is just horribly
    outlined, and really bumpy. I think the l was flipped for some reason. The stroke
    on the o is as thick as the G.\r\n\r\nIf it was based on a font, it was then horribly
    mangled into what we see today.\r\n\r\nI would believe that it was hand done and
    then scanned digitally. \r\n\r\nFor something similar, you might want to check
