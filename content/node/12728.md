    of the macro capabilities of digital cameras? My RDC-7 can do macro at ONE cm,
    and at its full resolution* that translates to over 2000dpi**. But it's a 3-4
    year old model now, so I'm wondering if that type of capability has become pretty
    standard, or do you have to pay a premium for that, or what.\r\n\r\n* It's funky
    \"Pro\" mode, which however requires a tripod.\r\n\r\n** Although you only get
    good focus right in the middle.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to registrering things I'd otherwise forget) I miss my old, trusty SLR.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing with digital is, that it doesn't have that same feel, I find them slow and
    cumbersome to 'navigate' menus. The fact that I have to navigate at all annoys
    me.\r\n\r\nThat said, I like all sorts of photography and every technique has

    So the problem with the macro is the lens quality. \r\n\r\nmy <a href=\"http://www.calumetphoto.com/ctl?PAGE=Controller&ti=cat.ItemCopy&ACTIVETAB=COPY_LONG&ac.ui.pn=cat.ItemDetail2&ac.item.itemNo=355-355C\"
    target=_blank>Nikon 28-135mm lens</A> for an SLR digita has a switch for macro/nomal.
    It lets you focus lower than 1.5 meters in macro. My Sunpack ring flash has a
    manual flash range of 20-100cm or 8'' - 40''. A ring flash of this kind is for
    dental or nature photos. \r\n\r\n1cm is a bit odd so it must be some distortion
    of the lens. If your images on the outside are as far away as the centre then
    it's a lens distortion. Macro is to fix close focus and lenses like my <a href=\"http://www.calumetphoto.com/ctl?PAGE=Controller&ac.ui.pn=cat.CatItemDetail&ac.item.itemNo=355-348H&ac.cat.CatTree.detail=y&type=PRDINDEX\"

  body: "> So the problem with the macro is the lens quality.\r\n\r\nI thought maybe
    that was something inherent to macro photography (I mean when taking a really
    close picture of something flat). BTW, mine does have a macro/normal selection;
    when you hit it, it feels like the entire lens assembly is moving to one end (which
    it can do because of its funky-cool physical format). I don't know what you mean
    by distortion, but the results right in the middle of the frame are pretty good...
    perfect for looking at single glyphs!  :-)\r\n\r\nSo let me ask you: if you were
    to take a maximum-\"dpi\" image of a line of small text, with your best equipment,
    could you get the entire line in focus?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I switched from analog photography to digital almost all the way. My old
    EOS and my Mamiya and Rollei are gathering dust these days, not too much of a
    shame about the Eos, but the other too.. oh well. \r\n\r\nI work with a 20D at
    the moment and have so far almost everytime upgraded whenever the next semi-pro-EOS
    digital cam came out, as there always were significant improvements. I'd love
    to have the 1D, but it is just to expensive to upgrade every two years, I feel...
    and as I'm not a pro-phtographer, I just don't need it all that much. And hey,
    most of all, of course, I'd love to have a H1D by Hasselblad :-D. \r\n\r\nMy workflow
    is that I shoot either directly with the Eos (using the Canon L-lenses) or tethered
    with BreezeSys' DSLR Remote Pro, which makes studio photography much more easy.
    \r\n\r\nI don't use photoshop to convert RAW (or even the awful original Canon
    Tools) but the superb CaptureOne, the only real tool for doing a bit of darkroom
    work on the files, and fast as lightning. \r\n\r\nThe final editing of the 16bit
    Tiff happens, of course, in the shop, mostly with the aid of AutoEye and nik ProPhoto,
    but some other filters as well. \r\n\r\nI think that digital photography saves
    you a lot of time in situ, but on the other hand you have to invest more time
    in the digital darkroom to get the results you want. This, however, to me personally
    was a liberating step. I never liked hovering round the photo lab and paying loads
    of money until I finally got the results on paper. It's much more natural for
    me, being a kid of the computer-design-age, to do what I did to \xABnormal\xBB
    photos anyway, that is work them over digitally. Only now, my basic ingredients
    are much better, as there isn't any scanner involved anymore. I almost always
    workon images I get, even if they are from external pro photographers, and I also
    do so on my own photos. \r\n\r\nIn many ways this has been as liberating as doing
    music on the computer. I can't hardly play a song on a real piano, but with constructing
    music on a PC, stacking sequences and elements... which is rather like designing
    music, I think... I actually do have a lot of fun (whenever I get around to it,
    which is almost NEVER these last two years :-().\r\n\r\nOh, and for \xABon the
    road\xBB I found myself getting a 5 MP Sony T3. Nice, small package, very well
    designed, fast reaction, but alas it is so small that most images are somewhat
    blurry... and the camera needs a flash too often, I think. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHD

    Made some great pix with it and I still think that for the time it was published
    it was a great product. \r\n\r\nMost other digital Cams can do 1 cm macro these
    days. If you need higher resolution, there are a couple of other options, if 2
    MP works fine for you, the RDC is still a very good choice. \r\n\r\nThe pro-Mode,
