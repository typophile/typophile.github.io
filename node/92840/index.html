		<div class="commentbody">@hrant - Components mean that the glyph outlines aren't defined in that character position, but are created by referring to other positions.  If you 'decompose' such a glyph, the outlines are now in their character's position. For example, the O-slash position could have pointers to the 'O' and the 'Slash' (component) or it could have the outlines right there (decomposed). There's a slight saving in file size using components; I believe that they must be decomposed before creating an open type font.

Now why rendering agents should display them differently, I have no idea. Possibly something to do with the rendering sequence, or outline directions,  or conflicting hinting, or ... or ...

		<div class="commentbody">Got it. But why ever leave overlapping outlines in the position? For one thing they take up <em>more</em> room than the overlap-removed one. So I assume Yanone is talking about referred components.

Also:
- I assume the rendering varies because for referred components each glyph is rasterized individually, then the bitmaps are merged. If so, that means it's slower than rendering a single outline-merged glyph. So you're trading rendering speed for download speed.
- Component referral only saves space if you use a component enough times (which might be as low as three, or even two, depending). For something like the cedilla there's probably no contest, but for the slash, I wonder.
- A problem with referred components -especially overlapping ones, and in darker weights- is that there's no opportunity for modulation. For example the lower curve of the /C/c should get thinner when a cedilla is attached. Then there's the ogonek, which likes to affect the base glyph bigtime...

The parts of a component are rendered to bitmaps separately and then the bitmaps are combined. Overlapping bitmaps are not a problem. Overlapping contours require the rendering to figure out the overlap and present a bitmap.

"For one thing they take up more room than the overlap-removed one..."

Plus.... a landscape oriented rectangle and a portrait oriented rectangle overlap and use 8 points and 10 hints. Remove overlap and you have 12 points and 14 hints. 

"...if an end user strokes the outline of the glyphs, they get undesirable results from overlapping components."

Not in Cooltype or any other savvy app. You Occidentals don't know squat about overlapping issues. ;)

Well, I've seen it, John has shown it, and it was at Adobe, where they make CoolType, that I both saw it and was taught about it being a problem. That was why they never allowed overlapping outlines in their western fonts.

Of course it is unavoidable for connected fonts, whether they are Arabic, Indic, or western connected script fonts. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be avoided where practical.</div>

The overlapping is only unavoidable if the outline is centered on the glyph’s periphery. In applications which allow you to place the outline <strong>behind</strong> the glyph, the problem disappears.</div>

They taught about overlapping TT at Adobe?

The TT spec allows overlapping contours and components from 1.0, and the only experience I've had where that didn't render properly was corrected by Apple in their iOS about two years ago, partly, I was told, because there isn't any software on the web that renders "western fonts" differently from "eastern fonts", and Apple has a lot of eastern fonts that follow the TT spec.

Besides all that, last time I tried to stroke and fill a live font on the web, the support was so inconsistent, forgetting about the overlap issue, that I had to include SVG and graphics to make my presentation show up on all browsers.

David — The png format itself should show up fine; but you included an ampersand in your file name, which will not work with the system. So, your image got lost somewhere on the server. If you rename the image with only alphanumeric characters, you can re-upload it and then it should work.</div>

The Aring example you're showing is a bug of some kind and bugs get fixed.
Is it happening with every font you try? 

I've looked at hundreds of different fonts using overlapping components on Mac platforms and have never seen this.
(And as rendering weirdness goes, it's not even that bad, IMHO.)
Certainly not enough for me to avoid TT fonts with overlapping components and/or actual outlines.

I haven't seen a problem yet, except for the one you're presenting.
