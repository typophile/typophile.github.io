    or whatever). Something like Fifteen's posters."

  body: Flavio, if you're on the Mac you might be interested in playing around with
    <a href="http://drawbot.com/">DrawBot</a>, it's a fun tool for drawing with Python
    and it has OTF support (but no feature support). Program the poster in DrawBot
    with whatever amount of Pythonic variation you want and then you can export each
    result as a PDF.

    the free software/open-source alternative to indesign/quark. it has a python scripting

  body: "I've just returned from the <a href=\"http://www.indesignconference.co.uk/\">InDesign
    Conference</a> <em>Half-Day Tutorial: Automating Page Layout with InDesign Scripting</em>
    talk given by Olav Martin Kvern, and I must say that it was simply brilliant.\r\n\r\nAs
    I understood, it is possible to script *any* task in InDesign (CS2), which is
    quite remarkable. His JavaScript demos were very insightful and easy to follow.
    (Like Python, JavaScript is an object-oriented language, so the two are quite
    similar in may aspects). The ExtendScript Toolkit application (that comes with
    the CS2 Suite) also makes scripting much simple.\r\n\r\nI was simply amazed how
    one can enhance InDesign's capabilities and batch process repetitive tasks quite
    easily. As anyone ever wished Photoshop's <em>Contact Sheets</em> or Illustrator's
    <em>Crop Marks</em> inside InDesign? Well, it's actually all possible! Simply
    download <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/xml_scripting.html#sresources\">these
    ready-made scripts</a> and place them in [InDy folder]/Presets/Scripts/. Then
    it's just a matter of bringing up the 'Scripts' palette (Window->Automation->Scripts)
    and start clicking**. Definitely worth trying!\r\n\r\nAlso worth following:\r\n<a
    href=\"http://jsid.blogspot.com/\">http://jsid.blogspot.com/</a>\r\nhttp://www.indesignsecrets.com/\r\n\r\n**
    The script \"ImageCatalog.jsx\" does the Photoshop-like function, and \"CropMarks.jsx\"
    the Illustrator-like one."

    reference mentions one OT feature which can be addressed by scripting but not

    'but': Despite of all nice things that scripting allows for, some automation should
    be available to non-scripters too. Like the data merge function which I read about
    only last week, though maybe a bit more powerful than it is. One cannot expect
    that soon every designer will find the time to learn JavaScript (or Python). I
    say this with ID as well as FLS in mind.\r\n\r\nKarsten\r\n\r\n* {edit: To my
    understanding, scripting InDesign in Python is kind of an add-on, which requires
    different solutions on Win and Mac (here it's kind of Python 'clothes' around
    AppleScript), and such Python scripts are not altogether platform compatible --
    which I would consider a must for a cross-platform application like InDesign.}"

  body: "> <em>Maybe the type department can convince the ID department that Python
    is worth being supported {natively}* too?  ;-)</em>\r\n\r\nI asked Olav Kvern
    about it. He said that the commitment is to support each platform's native scripting
    language \u2014 AppleScript/Mac, VBScript/Windows \u2014 and one cross-platform
    language (JavaScript). Nonetheless, his opinion is that more languages should
    be supported, rather than less. His goal is to allow people to script in whichever
    language they're more comfortable with. So, stay tuned :)\r\n\r\n> <em>Btw, the
    scripting reference mentions one OT feature which can be addressed by scripting
    but not by the UI.</em>\r\n\r\nThis one, I believe:\r\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag6.html#hlig\r\n\r\n>
    <em>Big \u2018but\u2019: Despite of all nice things that scripting allows for,
    some automation should be available to non-scripters too.</em>\r\n\r\nWell, that's
    debatable. We still don't have <em>real</em> artificial intelligence, or computers
    that can read the ideas we have on our minds and simply execute them, so people
    will still have to do some of the work. The way things are made available (documentation,
    samples, drag-and-drop, double-clicking, code hinting, etc) effectively simplify
    a lot of the stuff, even for 'native' non-scripters.\r\n\r\nI just think that
    people relate the word 'scripting' to something that only computer scientists
    can do. While that was very true some time ago, nowadays things are much much
    simpler. People just haven't got around to become aware of that, and to realise
    that a simple 5-line script, for example, can have a big impact on their daily
    work.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nHundreds of free scripts here http://share.studio.adobe.com/axBrowseSubmit.asp?t=54"

    correctly supports Unicode-compatible text rendering using Type 1, TrueType and

    powerful and works really nice. \r\n\r\nI've worked with the library's author
    Fredrik Lundh on a fix of a problem that causes PIL to crash on quite many fonts.
    The good news is that recently released version 1.1.6b1 does not have the problem
    anymore! \r\n\r\nYou can get the newest build of PIL at: \r\nhttp://effbot.org/zone/pil-changes-116.htm\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
