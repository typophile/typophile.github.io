body: "I understand that what I have to say might not be news. But it's a fresh pain
  in my heart, and I feel I have to talk about it.\r\n\r\nI was in the grocery store
  the other day, getting stuff to make an extensive breakfast spread for a group of
  friends. As I passed looked through the refrigerated section looking for some orange
  juice, my eye (that of a keenly college student) was immediately drawn to what I
  first thought was a generic brand OJ. Plain white box, picture of orange juice in
  a plain stemmed glass, little emphasis on the brand name, unremarkable. I assumed
  it was going to be a cheap knockoff. Then I saw the price, checked the label, and
  realized that Tropicana had betrayed my trust.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tropicana_6660.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  has come to my attention that that's how they package things in England. I've heard
  people say it's simple, nostalgic and streamlined. I think it's tragic. Sideways
  logo? Really? Absolute white space that just looks cheap? The leaves by the cap
  is cute, I like that, but now when I want to see an orange with a straw in it, I
  have to do it myself. And drinking an orange is not as easy as the former packaging
  implied. It makes me very sad. They've traded in an iconic image for a bland (no
  matter how tasteful and pretty the box is, it's ultimately something anyone could
  do and nothing exceptional) design.\r\n\r\nAlas.\r\n\r\nIt makes me almost as sad
  as seeing Lucida Handwriting on big, expensive signs.\r\n"
