  been advised that this edition of TypoGraphic will be of particular interest.\r\nThe
  problem is that I can't seem to get my hands on a copy anywhere as all of the back
  issues have been sold out. Is there anyone here who has a copy and would be willing
  to let me borrow it for a couple of months by sending it to me via post??\r\n\r\nI
  know it's a strange request but I would be so so grateful to anyone that can help
  me.\r\n\r\nMany thanks, Sam"

    you seen if you could get access to it through that?
