  thesis in which I\u2019ll try to join my passion about WWII history with my work.
  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a research about typography used in publications through all countries
  during WWII. \r\n\r\nSince it\u2019s quite hard to find out any info in this aspect
  I would love any help you can provide me. \r\n\r\nI have some newspapers, magazines
  and posters scans, if someone thinks it would be not much boring I could post then
  in the Type ID board.\r\n\r\nAnyway, ANY info on this subject would help me a lot.
  \r\n"

    a general timeline or are you still trying to figure out how to distill it down
    even further?\r\n\r\nI do know that actual type design almost ground to a complete
    halt during the wars as most foundries' purposes were diverted to the war. or
    perhaps you will focus on the type which was used and how? is this location dependant
    or again are you leaving that open? \r\n\r\ninteresting subject, typography during
    wwii, do you have a site setup with some examples yet?"

    and a specific type of typography, e.g. war standards book production in Britain,
    the typography of French resistance propaganda leaflets, etc.\r\n\r\nMark Batty

    used (and not necessarily produced) from the period just before war until its
    end (something like 1937 until 1945). My wish is that I could do it comprising
    the most countries as possible. My interest is on any kind of print issue. Magazines,
    flyers, newspapers.\r\n\r\nHere are some samples of what I\u2019ve got here:\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "The Russian sample you are showing at http://www.totalkrieg.com.br/sample.jpg
    is <strong>lettering</strong>, not typography. The typefaces used in Soviet Union
    during WWII were, almost without exception, old Russian or German makes, developed
    before 1917 (for manual composition), or the imported (American and English) matrices
    for Linotype and Monotype machines, designed in early 20th century. National newspapers
    printed in Moscow and Leningrad (Pravda, Izvestia and others) used A-P-L headline
    slugcasters manufactured by Mergenthaler Linotype, with matrices that came with
    those machines from the US (in early and mid- 1930s).\r\n\r\nThe very first Soviet
    type designs were developed\u2014primarily for the domestic linecasters\u2014only
    after 1936. They were <strong>Excelsior</strong> (a knock-off of one of the Linotype
    \u2018Legibility Group\u2019 typefaces, by Mikhail Shchelkunov and Nikolay Kudryashov,
    1936), <strong>Obyknovennaya Novaya</strong> (a version of Bodoni, by Nikolay
    Kudryashov, Galina Bannikova and Anatoly Shchukin, 1938\u201341), <strong>Literaturnaya</strong>
    (a version of Romana, by Anatoly Shchukin, 1939), <strong>Akademicheskaya</strong>
    (a version of Cheltenham, by Anatoly Shchukin, 1941). However, their use before
    and during WWII was very, very limited, and they are difficult to spot in Soviet
    wartime print."

    (a Soviet version of the ATF/Linotype Century Schoolbook) was developed in 1939
    by a group of designers directed by Evgeny Chernevsky. However, the design was
    completed only in 1949\u201361, by a design group headed by Elena Tsaregorodsteva,
    the leading member of the 1939 Chernevsky team. There were several other type
    designs whose development was interrupted by, or suspended during, the war.\r\n\r\nI
    waguely remember that <strong>Obyknovennaya Novaya</strong>, mentioned above,
    was developed for the new edition of the collected works of Lenin.\r\n"

    to explain I\u2019m still graduating, and am maybe 2 years from the graduation
    itself. My research is due a personal interest and the fact I\u2019m planning
    the thesis. Therefore, I\u2019ve no determinate patch to follow. My wish is that,
    together, we could compile that information. I\u2019m plenty of visual material
    but I have no knowledge about typefaces and thus I can\u2019t identify then.\r\n\r\nActually
    there\u2019s a post in this same forum about typefaces in late 40\u2019s and early
    50\u2019s.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll try to answer one by one.\r\n\r\nMAXIM: \r\n\r\nCould
    you please explain me the concept of lettering under this context? \r\n\r\n\u201CObyknovennaya
    novaya\u201D is the New Standart font right?\r\n\r\nSo, if those typefaces were
    barely used during WWII, which typefaces were used? You said it was mostly pre-1917
    German , American and English, could you tell me which one were these?\r\n\r\nGUSTAVO:\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot for the link. Now I must try to figure out which font faces are those :)\r\n\r\nTIFANNY:\r\n\r\nActually
    I don\u2019t have any advisor yet. As I said above I\u2019m far from graduating,
    but I\u2019m already picking things together. Also, I think this topic (or even
    a weki entry) would be a nice source of research for anyone :)\r\n\r\nSCOTT\r\n\r\nI

    the prewar specimens of Monotype Corporation and Mergenthaler Linotype, and in
    the catalogues of the Russian and German foundries of early 20th century (the
