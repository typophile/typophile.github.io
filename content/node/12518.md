  body: "I'd work on the modulation of the stroke widths a little. Right now it's
    a little \"gloopy\" and looks like it was autotraced from a scan. The loop on
    the y seems a little anemic, too. I do like the articulation in the e and the
    r, although you might want to consider making them a continuous, and cursive,
    script. That notch in the upper right of the e is pretty hot, although not very
    scripty.\r\n\r\nOverall, not bad!"

    looking better. Once I figure out how to attach a file to a reply (there doesn't
    seem to be an option to) I'll post an update. \r\n\r\n\xA1Cheers!"

  body: Chad get a Calligraphy pen and draw your letter forms again. By doing so you
    will see where the inconsistancies on where the thins and thicks of the letter
    forms, then you can adjust. I'm not suggesting not using what you have, but using
    the Calligraphy pen as a guide to letter form corrections.

  body: "I actually started with pen & ink for this. I scanned the letters and then
    created outlines in illustrator - then I started playing with the outlines, and
    I probably tried to smooth everything out a bit too much. I'll take a look back
    at the orginals - thanks for the tip!\r\n\r\nCheers!"
