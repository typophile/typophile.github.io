  <a href="http://www.kqed.org/programs/program-archive.jsp?progID=RD19&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;type=radio"
  target="_blank">Forum</a>, my local public radio talk show managed to do so for
  an hour. This was brought about by an exhibit at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.
  <BR> <BR>Scroll down to the  July 1st show and you can listen to the archive. <BR>
  <BR>Wanna find out more about the exhibit, here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.thinker.org/legion/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?exhibitionkey=252"
  target="_blank">Legion of Honor site</a> <BR> <BR>I assume the radio show was &#42;ahem&#42;
  illuminating as it frequently is, but I was a bit preoccupied when I heard it live
  so will have to follow the link myself and give it another listen. <BR> <BR>Haven&#39;t
  seen the show yet, but I plan to &#40;I&#39;ve got until August&#41;
