  pair of letters, as you can see from the spread attached it is the Vi, has anyone
  seen or heard of a ligature for this pairing, if not, does anyone have any ideas
  how I can make it look a little nore appealing. It just looks a little bit clumsy
  at the moment, or does it.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nMatt"
