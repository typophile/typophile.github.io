body: "I have been loving the Benedictine face since I first saw it a few months ago
  on pages 30-31 of McGrew's <em> American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century</em>.
  I searched once and again for information about it on the Internet, and, apart from
  a couple of sample images, I could only find (naturally) an old but quite revealing
  [[http://www.typophile.com/node/48585|post]] on Typophile, and, of course, that
  wonderful manual on typography by Mergenthaler Linotype from 1923.\r\n\r\nGiven
  that no one seems to have carried the remarkable beauty of the Benedictine family
  (an apparently forgotten gem) into the modern OpenType world, I decided to do it
  myself ...\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictinePro1_4032.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictinePro2_5260.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictinePro3_3479.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictinePro4_6067.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictinePro5_5293.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictinePro6_4267.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictinePro7_5283.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  Book weight (including small caps and italics) is almost finished, with Regular
  and Bold following (hopefully) shortly. For more information (including detailed
  specimen and sample sheets) please visit [[http://www.alterlittera.com/al_htm/oldtype/benedictine.htm|alterlittera.com]].
  I would be extremely grateful if you could send your advice on this project.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/al_logo_3429.png]"

  body: "Thanks for reading and commenting. Answers to questions posted in this and
    other threads are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. \"Wordspace may be too big\" - I would
    be very grateful if you could confirm this by having a look at this sample.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenedictineBook_3727.png]\r\n2.
    \"Small caps look relatively too large\" - I tried several metrics starting from
    the original sources, out of which I only retained those for the Book weight.
    Most of the glyphs (including the small caps) in the Regular and Bold weights
    were derived mainly from the Book weight. Among other things, the original x-heights
    of the Regular and Bold seemed too small to me when compared between them and
    to the x-height of the Book.\r\n\r\n3. \"I assume the Italics are not uniwidth
    with the Romans, but are they uniwidth among themselves?\" - Yes, they will be.
    I will also try to make them uniwidth with the Romans. That would be nice, I believe.
    However, it is not possible to achieve that effect with the original sources (on
    which the current version of the Book Italics is based).\r\n\r\nThanks."

    the \"o\" being too wide, but: there's a good deal of width variance elsewhere;

  body: Your font looks beautiful! I don't know if you took the letter spacing in
    small caps like it was in the original source, but to my eye it seems too tight
    (maybe it's because I got used to more loosely spaced small caps in old books).

      is my first attempt at a font with small caps. I decided to provide a letter
      spacing slightly more than proportional with respect to the upper and lower
      cases, which can be enlarged as desired within the design software. Maybe this
      is a reasonable move, or maybe not ... "

  body: "To me the 100% tracking looks good, when small caps are set separately as
    on your picture. But you should consider that the spacing of small caps also depends
    on the spacing of upper and lower case letters because they are often used in
    a context. For example small caps can be used among lower case text to attract
    attention to a certain word or paragraph (as means of selection) and here the
    more loosely spaced small caps (comparing to lowercase) will help the word to
    be  distinguished. Also small caps can play the role of lowercase in mixed setting,
    when the word set in small caps starts with an uppercase letter and here the spacing
    of small caps should be identical to uppercase, because they stand together in
    the same word. Also small caps can be used among the uppercase text (for example
    in a book title) and it is a common practice to use some tracking in uppercase
    setting (which can be programmed in a font with the \u201Ccpsp\u201D feature)
    so if you make such feature you should consider this too when deciding on the
    spacing of small caps (for the harmony between small caps and tracked uppercase).
    \ So there can be different situations and you can leave the spacing of your small
    caps as it is and let a designer who'll use your font to decide on tracking or
    try yourself find the spacing of small caps which will suit most of situations."
