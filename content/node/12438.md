  German book on [[calligraphy]], written by [[Rudolf Koch]]. The book title could
  be roughly translated as: <em>Writing as a Technical Skill</em>. The book is subtitled
  (again, this is a rough translation) <em>A complete introduction to the learning
  of the writing styles necessary for the profession of calligraphy.</em> The first
  edition of <em>DSaK</em> was published in 1925. Several editions followed. The following
  summary is based on the third edition, which was published in 1934 by the Publishinghouse
  of German Book Designers in Leipzig (<em>Verlag des Deutschen Buchgewerbevereins
  Leipzig</em>.\r\n\r\nThe book block is a bit larger than A4. It contains 96 pages
  (including 23 pages of black and white photographs). The entire book is set in blackletter.
  Body text is in a [[Fraktur]] that might be Koch's [[Fr\xFChling]]. The bolder tiles
  and subtitles are set in Koch's [[Maximillian]], which is not exactly a [[Fraktur]],
  but rather a combination of [[Fraktur]], [[Schwabacher]], and [[Gotisch]] ([[Textura]]).
  There is not color in th book. All of the text and imagery is black, on off-white
  paper.\r\n\r\nAside from calligraphic instruction, this book has a chapter on book
  design and binding, a chapter on the making of diplomas and certificates, and an
  appendix that details the proper writing and the devleopment of <em>Die Offenbacher
  Schrift</em> (<em>The Offenbach Hand</em>), a handwriting system for school children
  that seems to be based on [[S\xFCtterlin]].\r\n\r\nAnyone who ever wondered how
  Rudolf Koch formed his letters with a broad-nibbed pen can learn that from this
  book in about five minutes, so well-formed are the illustrations. How one writes
  in another style is only covered in this book contextually, not quite through imagery
  (except the schoolchildren's script in the appendix; there are also a various number
  of styles depicted in the 23-pages of photographic reference at the back of the
  book).\r\n\r\n<strong>Critique:</strong>\r\nThe German critic [[Hans Peter Willberg]]
  (1930\u20132003), wrote in <em>[[Typolemik]]</em> that all of Koch's students were
  trained to basically just copy his style, not to develop new writing forms. Reading
  this book, one would get that impression, too. It is important to remember that\u2014especially
  with calligraphy\u2014there can never be a \"one size fits all\" approach. The book's
  own subtitle states that the book will instruct all manners of necessary hands.
  Yet real blackletter variation is not covered. Nor is Antiqua or Grotesk, two styles
  which were well in practice by 1925 in Germany.\r\n\r\n[[Hermann Zapf]] has said
  that Koch's interpretation of how the pen should be held is false. Koch implies
  in this book that the pen should be held so that the nib stays at a 45-degree angle.
  [[Edward Johnston]] had written early that the pen should be held so that nib is
  at a 30-degree angle. Zapf follows the Johnston practice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fazit:</strong>\r\nThis
  is an invaluable book. Even if you cannot read German (or even if you can, but cannot
  read Fraktur), this book should be respected for the careers it launched: those
  of [[Hermann Zapf]] and [[Gudrun Zapf von Hesse]], amoung many others. The book
  seems to sum up Koch's ideas about writing, and Koch is consitantly held by typographers
  and calligraphers as one of the greatest masters of western calligraphic tradition.
  If you want to learn to write like Koch, this is the source. The images are understandable
  even without German fluency.\r\n\r\nThe book is readily available in German antiquaries
  and used book stores. Try searching them with the website <a href=\"http://www.zvab.com\">ZVAB.com</a>.
