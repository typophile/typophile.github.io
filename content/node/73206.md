body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nA couple of weeks ago I removed some fonts from my PC
  and since then my sabon italic font doesn't seem the same. Whenever I select a word
  to make it italic it looks darker than the roman text. I have tried reinstalling
  my sabon variants (I have some specially designed diacritics for use with it) but
  to no avail. \r\n\r\nI have no idea what to do to resolve this and would appreciate
  any tips you might have\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I havent printed anything yet, but I have noticed that my old pdfs with this
    font do not have the same problem, whereas every single word document--from both
    before and after this problem--show the italics darker than the rest of the text.

  body: 'Hmm, strange. It only shows bolditalic and there is no option for normal
    italic. The odd thing is although the italisized word is darker than the roman,
    it can get even darker when I select bold. '

    documents?

    need to look at this thread...\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/t-medium/characters.html\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that you have the Monotype version, which has a regular italic, semibold
    italic and bold italic, and Word is subbing the semibold for the regular, but
    Acrobat is reading semibold as bold."
