<div class=commentbody>There are typical regional preferences in currency symbols, but not really standard distinctions. At the character encoding level, there is simply a dollar character, and whether the glyph in a font has one stroke or two is a design decision. So what your client is expressing is a New Zealand preference for fonts in which the dollar sign has a single stroke.
This is very similar to the supposed distinction between the British sterling symbol and the Italian lira symbol (although this did result in partial disunification at the character encoding level; I say partial, because the lira character U+20A4 ended up not being used very much, and most Italians continued to use the sterling character U+00A3). The argument there was that the British sterling symbol most often had a single bar (but could have two) but the Italian lira sign must always -- yes, always, absolutely everywhere -- have two bars. I had great fun in Italy wandering around the markets, pre-euro, photographing all the price signs in which the lira had only one bar :)

<div class=commentbody>Kris, kia ora. The single versus double is really an aesthetic thing. There is also the option of having the strokes only off the top and bottom of the "s", and not filling in the counters, which is useful in heavy weights.
The same issue occurs with the Euro and Sterling glyphs, which at heavier weights and in Oldstyle variants, tend to get pretty thick around the middle with two strokes. There are several currency signs which call for double strokes: Yen (U+00A5), Colon (U+20A1), French Franc (U+20A3), Lira (U+20A4, as noted in the Unicode document, this is like the Sterling symbol but with two horizontal strokes; most people chose to use the Sterling glyph instead.), Naira (U+20A6), Won (U+20A9), Tugrik (U+20AE; the double strokes are angled), and Peso (U+20B1). And probably some more.
In my life I have been called on to revise a double-stroke Sterling glyph to better differentiate it from the Euro.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry chester, I've heard Si's point before. According to some EU rule, the word "euro" is always to be written with a lowercase e. The German-speaking countries got an exception, since German capitalizes the first letter in nouns (der Euro).
I presume, however, that euro may also be written EURO, since eURO would just be silly ;-)
Of course, type designers could just go around calling the euro the Euro… we don't seem to hold ourselves to the strict guidelines for the design of the Euro symbol, either.
But you should get this… what if everyone started calling you Chester (with a capital C)?</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>I thought that the Euro was cap-E’d, not just because the official Unicode name is (curiously) capitalised</em>
You mean the official Adobe Glyph List name (all Unicode names are all caps: U+20AC = EURO SIGN). David Lemon explained a few years ago that he had seen 'Euro' written capitalised in a number of places, so capitalised it in the AGL, despite the fact that no other currency symbol glyph names are capitalised.</div>

<div class=commentbody>e. e. cummings and I had this conversation all the time...
Since I have taken to designing all of my currency symbols in both majuscule/lining and miniscule/oldstyle, I propose that Euro refer to the former, and euro to the latter. (Ditto Dollar and dollar, Yen and yen, etc.) This is consistent with the names for letters, like Dcaron and dcaron, Eth and eth, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>To add more fuel to this fire...
As an Australian graphic designer and typographer I have been faced with the one slash versus two a couple of times in my career. The request to use the single stroke dollar sign usually comes from editors and seems to stem from an ingrained cultural bias against the double stoke, in that it is associated with the US dollar. There is some colloquial evidence to suggest that Australians adopted the single stroke dollar sign after WW2 to differentiate the Australian Dollar from the US dollar, essentially an attempt to distance us from the 'Seppos' (charming rhyming slang, Americans > Yanks > Septic tanks > Seppos). I imagine the Kiwis acted on equal sentiments...</div>

<div class=commentbody>The font used for official United States diplomatic documents (except for telegraphs and a few other exceptions), as well as its predecessor, has a single-stroked dollar sign. (14pt Times New Roman, 12pt Courier New before). Actually Courier New has the half-lines, only above and below the S.
On the Mac I'm posting from right now, there are 336 typefaces available, this is based on a standard Mac OS X Tiger install with MS Office, Matlab, MAPLE, and TeX installed as well. Of those 336, just over a dozen have the double stroke. More have the broken stroke than a double stroke, although the single unbroken stroke is by far the most common.
OT: Niels, I've always thought it odd when I hear Aussies referring to us insulting as Seppos, since calling us, or at least those in my region, a Yank would be far more offensive/insulting (but then again, I'm from the Deep South).

<div class=commentbody>I've just had another look at this forum, and although a little off the topic, but still relevant, is this little tidbit:
The dollar sign actually evolved from a mark that is a representation of p8, the contraction of 'pieces of 8' (Spanish currency used in the Americas). It evolved into the 'S' with the two bars. Mechanical reproduction of type caused the removal of the second bar as the two thin lines so close to each other would cause ink to run, or blend into one line anyway. Hence one bar. Type designers are now even doing away with the part of the bar inside the character.

And probably some more.</cite>
For what it's worth, the won symbol (₩) can have one or two horizontal strokes. I'm not even sure which version I'd use in my own handwriting though. Maybe a slight preference for two strokes... The thing is, Koreans don't use the symbol that often in ordinary writing, and instead write out 'won' in Hangul (the Korean alphabet; it's not that long). We see it on price tags, printed out. Many fonts use the one-stroke variant.
If I remember correctly, the symbol for yen or yuan (¥) can also have one or two strokes; the Japanese prefer two for the yen symbol, while the Chinese seem to use the one-stroke version a lot more for the yuan symbol.
By the way, I cannot for the life of me remember for certain if the written shorthand for Kenyan shillings (or colloquially, 'bobs') is '/-' or '/='. I remembered it as '/=', but <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling>the Wikipedia article on 'shilling'</a> has it as '/-', and now I'm dreadfully confused. It's as though the fact that one-stroke and two-stroke versions are interchangeable in many currency symbols is messing with my memory. Well, it <em>has</em> been more than six years since I left Kenya...
I suspect both '/-' and '/=' are used, with a preference for '/=' in Kenya, but does anyone know for sure?</div>

Guess what.
If a dollar symbol has only one strike, it means the backing behind the currency is void, like the symbols Ф, which only has one strike.
If a dollar symbol has two strikes, it means the currency is backed by substance, such as silver.
Statutory government, which operates in pure fiction, only recognizes the single strike version of the currency.
If you provide a double-strike symbol in a statutory government document, they won't know how to recognize the symbol. In fact, if it is a court case, they might throw it out, because courtrooms only operate in fiction, unless they are in the common law.</div>

<div class=commentbody>[[Hermann Zapf]]’s [[Palatino]] Linotype (the version that ships with Windows) has both versions. The single stroke version is the default (U+0024). Its small-caps feature only the single stroke version.

Palatino also has two versions of the Yen sign (¥). Then, there’s an alternative Pound (£) glyph which descends below the baseline. The double stroke £ is actually the Lira sign (₤).

<div class=commentbody>Hello! I was once addicted to typography. Was surfing and this popped up. Thought you would like to know the story about the US dollar sign. The $ symbol indicates fiat currency which we currently use. It's a worthless debt instrument. The double bars in the old symbol indicated US the U was cropped off. The double bars indicated that it was true currency redeemable upon demand. In 1965 all the typewriters changed over to the single bar. Old ones all have the double bar.
So, two bars is when we had a pot to piss in.
one bar is what we currently use, worthless pieces of paper backed by nothing more than guns.
Have fun digging up that skeletion!

<div class=commentbody>I use the double bar whenever I write the dollar sign by hand (in Canada). The reason may have to do with the fact that I played a lot of Monopoly when I was young and there was a double bar dollar sign on the game cover from the 1970's.
I thought that the current, pervasive use of the single bar dollar sign had to do with the advent of the personal computer and the decision to use the single stroke $ symbol to denote a 'string' in the early computer programming languages. Since the first users of the personal computer were mostly programmers, I imagine that it would have made sense to put the string key $ on the keyboard rather than the dollar sign (with double bar). Or rather, if my history is wrong and a single bar dollar sign was in fact an acceptable or current form at that time (but I was too young to know it), then the single bar dollar sign was likely chosen since it would show up better on small, lower-res computer screens and with the low-res dot-matrix computer printers. As everybody uses computers now to write rather than by hand, with the printed word following the type found on the computer (e.g. newspapers, price stickers, etc.), we seem to be stuck with the single bar dollar sign.

<div class=commentbody><blockquote> a single strike rather than a double </blockquote>
Today, Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in South America.
Ironically it was the largest producer of Silver ever known to mankind.
41,000 metric tons of pure silver were mined from Cerro Rico from 1556 to 1783 by Spanish invaders, killing thousands of natives in the process. And, as the local indians where to few, they also imported African slaves to keep mining Potosí silver.
As a result of this exploitation, the spanish silver coins experienced an enormous global boom, and became the most widespread currency in the world in the 18th century. The spanish Potosí silver coins where accepted by traders all around the world. It became the first 'World Currency'.
“Vale un Potosi” (It is worth a Potosi) became a commonly used expression to describe vast wealth, after Quixote blurted it out in Cervantes’s Don Quixote.
These coins where also know as the "Spanish dollar".
The Spanish dollar was the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based, and the Potosí silver coins remained legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857.
The coins looked like this:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/potosi-coins_4878.png]
Some theories suggests that the Dollar sign we know today, is the result of removing the spanish coat of arms from the middle of the coin, and merging the 2 remaining columns together under one unified ribbon.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A little more info:
The text in the ribbons used to say: "Plus Ultra" (Latin for "further beyond").
The motto was used to encourage Spanish sailors to disregard ancient Greek Mythology warnings about the Pillars of Hercules, and send them to explore the new world.
Thus, the two vertical lines represent the Pillars of Hercules. And the s-shaped ribbon represent the desire to go beyond limits and conquer the world.
