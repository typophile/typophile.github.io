body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI am looking for some assistance with the lettering on a project
  I am working on. The symbol itself is complete but I would like to take the typographical
  elements further. My main concern is with the 'y' at the moment, is it too distracting?
  \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your feedback on this logotype.\r\n\r\nI ask that
  we not mention the client just for search engines.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid

  body: "Mm, yes the y was the first thing I noticed. And the s looks distorted. Is
    this custom lettering?  I can see you're aiming for something that echoes the
    square curves of the star shapes but I wonder if there might be a better font
    choice. Also the alignment isn't quite vertically centred so the two elements
    don't look quite unified.\r\n\r\nAs always, it's hard to be helpful without knowing
    a bit about what the organisation does and what its unique proposition and values
    are. "

  body: "Thank you for your comments Ben. The lettering is custom made exactly. For
    now I have not placed the symbol in an optimal position I think, this might be
    best to do once the type is ready.\r\n\r\nFor some background information the
    company from Bavaria in Germany. The idea of their company is that of igniting
    something in a person which leads to personal growth. They required a more corporate
    style as they are more b2b.\r\n\r\nRegarding the 's', in a previous iteration
    I did have this kind of 's' - it probably does work better. I have also included
    another idea I had for the 'y' which is less distracting.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo2_4270.png]"

  body: i think the new 's' work better. i like the new 'y' more but i would love
    too see the 'y' bottom ending  like the 's' or 'e'.

- body: I'd like to see the 'y' with an ascender exactly like the 'p'. Right now,
    the bowl of the 'y' looks too big, and so does the set width of the 's'. The 's'
    also looks unbalanced.

  body: 'Your latest version looks loads better than what you''ve had before. Especially
    the new "s" is a big improvement (compared to version #1). The straight "y" is
    also working but I think it''s too close to the "p" if you compare it other letter
    combinations like "p" and "n".'

  body: "Like the rounding and the new s fits in better. \r\nOf these, I like #2.
    Just a thought: (Not sure how it would affect balance and/or readability) - what
    if you joined the y and the p to share the same descender, but gave it the tail
    in #1? It might play too many tricks on the eyes - but then again, the word is
    Hypnose...\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: "Thank you all for the great feedback. I too believe the second option is
    better.\r\n\r\nI have incorporated Stefan's comment of the 'y' 'p' kerning. I
    have included Kate's recommendation too, but found it did not yield a usable direction
    I'm afraid to say but I sincerely appreciate the input.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo4_5099.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think I am ready to move forward on this project and commence the alignment of
    type and symbol; unless anybody can see any major issues. I welcome any comments.\r\n\r\nThanks

    but now it's perfect. I'm curious about what you will do with the symbol.\r\n\r\nSomehow
    I want to see the upperstroke of the 's' having the same length like it's bottomstroke,
    though I think it's best in it's current shape -- I would only like to make sure
    about this."

    would \"grow\" out of the e? \r\nThe process of power hypnosis will lead to the
    growth of the symbol - does that make any sense?"

  body: Nice, I like it a lot. I actually enjoyed the slanted 'y' in the first one
    but it seems to work better matching the 'p'. The star shape works well in the
    last one too. It makes sense without being too predictable.
