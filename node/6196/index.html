		<div class="commentbody">&gt; do you Think that Garamond is French because you know it was Produced in France? <BR> <BR>Good question. And of course I can't really know the answer: a system can never understand itself. <BR> <BR>I think there are two levels of knowledge, conscious and subconscious, with the latter being more shallow and inconstant, but more forceful. The fact that I consciously know that Garamond is of French origin ruins any possible subconscious appreciation. Fortunately for laymen (readers) they don't know the background, so the type can have a deeper association with social/national/ethnic context. Do laymen associate Garamond with French culture? My point is that they do, if only to a limited extent. What about Peignot? Very much. <BR> <BR>&gt; Even the most neutral typefaces have something to say. <BR> <BR>What does FF Kievit have to say? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a French Secam VHS video from French TV where they ask people on the streets what they associate with some particularly fonts composed always with same word George: fonts are Arepo, Champion (one from Boltana, a Copperplate), Kosmik, Skia, Le Monde masterhead font (the only black letter I have at hand). <BR> <BR>The answer has been (various but the main idea is there by the majority): Grec yogurt, Men fashion/perfum, Camembert, Trash/fun young, and I miss the last one? Just try to put right font to right stuff as people in Paris streets. <BR> <BR>*** <BR> <BR>Anyway, about country/typefaces, I will say that its more culture/typeface than anything else, and less and less possible to see anything, because the world became very small (from 20th). And also until recently, most of fonts we fond on computers came from US-German-English companies with strong technical restrictions. <BR> <BR>*** <BR> <BR>To answer to miguel, the best to him, depending from where he came is to take some traditionnal typefaces from his country as starting point to do a revival. More fun and culturally interesting for him and us. <BR></div>

Just you wait a couple of centuries and see if Meta is not considered universal. <BR> <BR>To me universal fonts are well crafted ones, immediate and personal, like those designed by jean francoise. i just hope that when it comes to pixel renditions of these new classics there is due respect paid. ok miguel? maybe its ok if you stick with your garamond project ;) <BR></div>

It gets tricky for text face design, but that's just a matter of subtlety - never try to supress it, just let it flower in the right way.</i> <BR> <BR>i agree. thats preciously how it should be handled. influence should stream both ways, and in a harmless manner, so that (for eg.) the original hebrew letterforms wont be bruised too badly, and that israeli designers will make latin fonts that subtelty show their designer's background.  <BR>sometimes, though, there's not a choice for the designer. hebrew fonts with strong latin characteristics are in need now, and this need overpowers the need to preserve the original characteristics of hebrew.  <BR> <BR>thats how it looks to me, when i view the spectrum of hebrew fonts in israel today. <BR> <BR></div>
