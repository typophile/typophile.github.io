    You should also contact Cooper Union about summer housing, as the neighborhood
    around Cooper is packed with dormitories that are rented to students in the summer.
    You can also find hostel and student housing services with Google.\r\n\r\nLook
    for apartments in the East Village, Lower East Side, SoHo, NoHO, or Union Square
    neighborhoods if you want to walk to Cooper Union. If you do not want to walk
    at least make sure to find an apartment near an N, Q, or R subway station. Do
    not get an apartment in the Bronx, New Jersey, or Staten Island as they are too
    far away. Be very careful about Queens and Brooklyn, there are safe and dangerous
    neighborhoods in both and you really need a resident to tell you which is which."

    have no idea where you can find a summer rental, but [[http://www.corcoran.com/newyork/|Corcoran
    Realty]] may be of some help."
