  Adrian Frutigers typefaces have been used.(for a student project.) By \u201Cused\u201D
  I mean adopted in brand identities, signage systems, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat i have so
  far includes; Avenir's use in the visual identity of Amsterdam and Univers's use
  in the Paris Metro, Montreal Metro and numerous airports.\r\n\r\nAny use will be
  of help but the quirkiest the better!\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n"

    (for a reference refer to Bringhurst's The Elements of Typographic Style, p. 257).\r\n\r\nAnd
    according to wiki:\r\n[Frutiger] was commissioned in 1968 by the newly built Charles
    De Gaulle International Airport at Roissy, France, which needed a new directional
    sign system. Instead of using one of his previously designed typefaces like Univers,
    Frutiger chose to design a new one. The new typeface, originally called Roissy,
    was completed in 1975 and installed at the airport the same year."

    It replicates Andys point about the Fruti airport usage, but part of the problem
    you face with this is that\r\na) Frutiger is prolific \u2013 lots of examples
    from lots of typefaces\r\nb) many corporate brand identities may have used the
    'unquirky' Frutiger faces as a starting point, but will have tweaked them in development
    and application\r\nc) Linotype doesn't appear to be trumpeting the 'quirky' aspects
    of Frutiger's work.\r\n\r\nI know that Meridien and Univers were used for corporate
    IDs for banks here (in NZ). Univers Condensed Thin and Ultra get used for film
    poster credit lines (as Stephen Coles has pointed out elsewhere on typophile)."

    you have mentioned in your second point (ben_archer) that would be great to add
    to my research. The link you gave was of great help also. \r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n "
