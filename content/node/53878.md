body: "We had to make our rounds through the city and take photographs of different
  signage.  I don't think that these signs are necessarily \"New Orleans\" but they
  were just some signs I have always thought were particularly neat.\r\nFirstly, I
  thought it was pretty funny how there is a sign for a sign making business, also
  it has a sort of vintage quality. But mostly it just tickles my ribs cause its a
  sign... advertising signs... hopefully I'm not the only one who gets joy out of
  that.\r\nMike the Bike Guy has a nifty sign too, clever really. 'Mike' and 'Bike'
  share three letters, and all he did was keep the '-ike' on the sign once and have
  both the 'M' and 'B' there sharing that ending.\r\nThe Royal Sonesta Hotel in the
  French Quarter doesn't have a sign that is really that 'New Orleans,' rather its
  reminds me of old-timey New York City Broadway signs with its retro typeface and
  lightbulb-filled interior. Something about it makes me feel classy, like I should
  expect to see Kong carrying Fay Wray up the Empire State Building. Again, hopefully
  thats not just me.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what to make of things when people
  ask about stuff (in this case, signs) that are 'New Orleans.' When I think of signs
  in New Orleans, old saloon-style typefaces, classic Industrial Revolution-era and
  elegant carvings come to mind. However, not many of this type of sign are present
  anymore, and have been replaced with newer signs. In my opinion, New Orleans signs
  could be compared to signage in many other southern cities.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SIGNS_6122.gif]"
