body: "Hello all, quick question.\r\n\r\nWhen a quote is at the end of a sentence
  in body text, where does the full stop fall, inside or outside of the speech mark?
  I find this especially confusing when the quote is a full sentence, which in its
  original context ended with a full stop.\r\n\r\nAm I correct that when a quote is
  within a text the comma (if needed) falls outside of the speech mark because it
  relates to the structure of the overall sentence construction?\r\n\r\nI am avoiding
  examples in case I mislead you, please respond only if you are certain!\r\n\r\n(I
  searched low and high for the answer but found many conflicting answers)\r\n\r\nThanks,
  the oracle always has the answer."

  body: "I'd like to quote myself as saying, \"You put the period/full stop inside
    the quotes.\" When it's within a sentence, \"like this,\" the comma still goes
    inside the quotes. \r\n\r\nThe exception is with questions. Normally, 99% of the
    time, the quotation mark goes inside the quotes:\r\n\r\n\u2022 So I asked him,
    \"Do you think it will rain today?\" \r\n\u2022 Did he ask, \"Have you any Grey
    Poupon?\"\r\n\r\nThe exception is if the sentence is a question about a quote
    which is not a question:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Who said \"Give me liberty or give me death\"?
    \r\n\r\nHope this is useful. I believe exclamation points follow the same rules
    as question marks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

  body: "Thanks JT\r\n\r\nThe thing that concerns me is that there is not a consistent
    logic. I guess that is just the English language. I'm quite embarrassed by my
    poor grasp of it.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have a different house style? Speak now and
    forever hold your peace!\r\n\r\n(Thanks again JT)"

  body: 'Yes. There is no consistent rule ("logic"). Moreover, there is "English"
    and "American," and probably some others to boot. In the States, many follow the
    <cite>Chicago Manual of Style</cite> -- but even in the States, that is only one
    of several styles. '

  body: "JT's guidance was correct with this caveat: in American English editing,
    it is preferred to put the period (what we Americans call a \"full stop\") inside
    the quotation marks, while in British English editing, the preference is to leave
    the full stop outside the quotation marks.\r\n\r\nSo, Nick says, \"Put the full
    stop inside the quotation marks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" he added, \"you happen to
    live in England, in which case you can get away with them outside of the quotation
    marks.  Consider context\".\r\n\r\nFor a more thorough treatment of this, and
    other important punctuational issues, do check out <em>Eats, Shoots and Leaves</em>
