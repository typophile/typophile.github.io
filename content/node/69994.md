body: "Hey everyone, I am looking for a font that would go well with the font \"Market
  Deco.\" It is a free font that can be found at [[http://www.dafont.com/market-deco.font]].\r\n\r\nThis
  is for a documentary over local theatres that I'm working on as an immersion project
  for school. Market Deco is the font of the headings or titles (mainly in motion
  graphics). I need a nice, clean and legible font that compliments it well as a subheading.
  Something that doesn't stick out as much as the Deco font, less bold.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n-Andy"

    If you want something with less character maybe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/burin_sans_std_regular/\">Burin
    Sans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/dessau_pro/\">Dessau</a>,
    or a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/futura/\">geometric
    sans</a>."
