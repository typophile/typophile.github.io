body: Can anyone suggest a good compliment for Helvetica Neue Medium Extended. The
  use will be in small to medium doses of copy in a brochure and workbooks (fill-in-the-blank
  type). I need at least a book and bold weight with italics and prefer to have small
  caps if possible. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

  body: "Thanks for the replies.\r\n\r\nI actually proposed Minion on the first comps.
    Unfortunately, the client wants something \"snazzy\" and \"modern\". I have looked
    at Eidetic Neo, but some of the letterforms in the italic set are hard to get
    used for some of the people I am trying to please. You know, they want a contemporary
    classic serif-sans-serif in a dainty heavy weight. Everything looks like Times
    to them so there's probably not much use in scouring the earth looking for the
    perfect serif face to compliment the \"invisible\" Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks
    for all the help."
