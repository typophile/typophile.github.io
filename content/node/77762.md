body: "A lengthy name for a logo, yes.  I had to create the logo with the entire 'Seattle
  Search Marketing .Net' was in the actual logo for identifying reasons, but also
  wanted to create a design element to make it pop a bit and make it easier to identify
  the brand.  \r\n\r\nYou will see my attached logo includes themed circles throughout,
  from the 'S' shaped green and blue 'black hole' (which could also resemble a spinning
  arrow during search) -- to the same style dot/circle between Marketing and Net.\r\n\r\nYou
  will see how it looks on black, which will be the main use, since the logo will
  be for a services/blog website.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly happy with the results, but feel
  something could be missing to make it a bit stronger.  Maybe it's a font change
  - if anyone has any suggestions on fonts...Any thoughts?"

    doing the job owner has to be wise enough. The logo represents <a href=\"http://www.realwebseo.com/search-engine-marketing/\">search
    marketing</a> the company so keeping the reputation and success of the industry
    it\u2019s logo has to be perfect. Thanks for a worthy detail about it."

  body: In my opinion the mark (symbol) is too generic and it does not really "pop".
    Basically if I were to see it a week from now without the accompanying label,
    I would've not remembered what it was for nor would I have been able to reconstruct
    the brand from it.

  body: "The whole shape of the logo is not harmonious--it calls attention to itself
    in the bad way (which is why you think something is missing). \r\n\r\n\r\nYou
    don't HAVE to use Myriad. All that does these days is scream Apple. Search Marketing
    sounds like it might have a more tech vibe, but maybe the font is ok. The color
    scheme is also quite organic and natural. Something tells me it there ought to
    be a more sophisticated, deeper color palette.\r\n\r\nBut better typesetting would
    help tremendously. \r\n\r\nSee the example, nothing saying its a good logo, but
    I'm putting it up just to say you need to think more simply:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-3_3632.jpg]"

    \r\ni think your logo not providing intersting idea. Dotes can be found in a lot
    of logos (form 90s) try combine with name and discipline. Maybe focus on seattle
    and search. try to illustrate this words together. good luck.  "
