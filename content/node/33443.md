  body: That appears to be a heavy weight of <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html"
    target="_blank">Blippo</a> (with the alternate S). The trouble is that it falls
    in weight between Bold and Black and I'm not aware of such a thing. The closest
    I know of digitally is Fontbank's <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/brandish.htm"
    target="_blank">Brandish</a> - which corresponds with Blippo Bold.
