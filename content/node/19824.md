  body: "Atlantic: looks hand drawn for sure\r\n\r\n2 Tone could be Helvetica Inserrat
    or another Helvetica (the Specials part, but not the 2 Tone part - that is not
    a Helvetica 2)\r\n\r\nTrojan - I think also hand drawn - RECORDS is more condensed
    than TROJAN and that R has been customized for sure."

  body: There seems to be more than 4 or 5 fonts on the 2 TONE cd. The track information
    is in Univers I think, the <strong>2</strong> feels like Avant Garde. The <strong>SPECIALS</strong>
    could be Helvetica Inserat but not quite? <strong>RECORD</strong> is something
    else completely, I think this is too much for me, Sorry! :^x

  body: "SPECIALS does look a lot like Helvetica Inserrat. Bear in mind this is pre-digital
    (I have that album on vinyl!)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica-inserat/\r\n\r\nTROJAN
    reminds me of Fashion Didot but it's not an exact match. There are a lot of fonts
    like that in the original Solotype and Photolettering catalogs - but many not
    digitized.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/fashion-didot/"

  body: "Actually, the \"TLANTIC\" part of Atlantic in the sample you posted looks
    like a [[squooshed]] version of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.120906.0.28&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=TLANTIC&sampleSize=48\"
    target=\"_blank\">Helvetica Rounded Black Oblique</a> but the original Atlantic
    logo may have been hand-drawn.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
