body: "I used the [[language system tag|languagesystem tag]] in my OTF CFF font. In
  the OpenType Features preview pane in FL 4.6 I can see the script armn and the language
  HY, and the features work. But when I export the font and try it in InDesign, the
  features are not available.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?"

  body: InDesign does not support language system tags. Unfortunately, there are currently
    no shipping applications that support this feature of OpenType Layout, although
    I have seen demonstrations of functionality in Microsoft software. To get your
    Armenian lookups to work within InDesign, you may need to associate the lookups
    with the Latin script and dflt language tags.
