Back when Luc was active in comp.fonts and other discussion forums, he was very outspoken in opposition to intellectual property protection for type design, so rubbed a lot of designers the wrong way. It wasn't just the opinions that pissed people off, but the fact that they came from a tenured academic who can do and say pretty much whatever he wants without any consequences. It seemed too easy, from such a position, to make pronouncements about things that other people perceive as affecting their livelihoods.

As for his site, I've never found it very useful for the things that interest me, despite or perhaps because of its unselective exhaustiveness. Huge numbers of the links are dead, especially in the non-Latin pages, and appear not to have been checked since he first added them, sometimes many years ago.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point about the "too easy". Another good point is that some people perceive a possibility of making a livelihood where there really isn't one and it's not a disagreeable academic's fault if they have to resort to living in the boondocks to be able to avoid earning a living in an undesirable way. Ergo: it's also "too easy" to blame others for one's weak grasp of reality.

BTW John, I don't mean you. :-)  I think you're capable of making a living in type pretty much anywhere. But most type designers are not.

True that hrant, I'm referring to our private email correspondence(s). He has always been a gentlemen to me and very engaging. 
I'd also like to say for me his website has given me far more than I could ever repay. I've learnt so much. I only hope that it's around for decades to come for other designers (or whomever) to tap into.

Ah.

It certainly is true that IP protection is essential to allow people to make a living from their creativity or inventiveness; it promotes a faster pace of creation and progress.

It does, however, for example, also create a large part of the barriers to entry in nearly every industry that maintain the divide between the world's rich and poor countries.

I think that only used to be true in the past, and is now an outdated view; I think monopoly rights restrictions today tend to retard progress, cf Benkler.

<em>No, it's not. Artist should be paid for their work, just like butchers get paid for a leg of lamb. “Virtual” goods are still goods…</em>

I agree labour should be paid, but I don't think that artists or anyone else <em>deserves</em> to be paid for their work. People deserve to earn what others are willing to pay them for; if someone's art is shit, they're shit outta luck. ;p

And I disagree that "“Virtual” goods are still goods" - digital works and physical property are fundamentally different in nature, since digital works can be duplicated and redistributed, and modified, in a way that physical property can not. But the labour/service of creating the works remains open as viable commercial activity. </div>

As Utah Philips said, the past didn't go anywhere. The fact that intellectual property laws have been hijacked by corporations doesn't mean that the original reasons why those laws came to be seen as a good idea have gone away. Indeed, today they are often the only thing standing between a creative individual and the uncompensated economic exploitation of his work <em>by those same corporations.</em> If you want to do away with corporate monopoly rights restrictions, you need to come up with an alternative mechanism to prevent exploitation of individual creators.</div>

<cite>Using that same logic, I suppose that nobody really deserves to live, either.</cite>

Well, the wording of the poster you quoted began the process of confusing things.

The statement "Artists deserve to be paid for their work" (which I will refer to as X) has more than one meaning.

To say:

P: <em>Artists should not have their work appropriated without compensation.</em>

is <em>not</em> to say

Q: <em>Artists are entitled to compensation for their creative work irrespective of whether or not there is any market demand for that work.</em>

So when someone makes the ambiguous statement X in a context where it is clear that person is asserting P, for someone to say that, no, X is false, because <strong>Q</strong> is false... begins the process of creating confusion.

I think, though, that your post <em>continued</em> the process of getting things thoroughly confused.

An example of an opinion that avoids confusion might be:

Artists do deserve to live, <em>and</em>, like everyone else, they deserve to be free from interference in their efforts to live.

Thus, on the one hand, they do deserve protection from having their work appropriated without compensation.

On the other hand, if their work is not of interest to the market, the best they should expect from their right to live is to get welfare like anyone else, not to have the government support their art with tax dollars.

I'm not saying one has to agree with that opinion.

On the one hand, some Libertarians strongly support copyright laws, while followers of related political beliefs question where the authority to enact a copyright or patent law could come from (on the assumption that without a natural law right as its basis, such a law would be a government tax decree, not a protection against force or fraud).

On the other hand, non-Libertarians might see government patronage of the arts (but hopefully with <em>some</em> judgment of the quality of what is supported) as essential to a civilized society.

I'm not even claiming the opinion given as an example as my opinion; I'm just noting that here is how one can debate these issues while keeping them sorted from each other.</div>

How? Will authors be paid some sum up front to produce novels? Paid by whom? On what basis would the sum be calculated? The commercial value of such creative works cannot be determined until they exist and are products in the market, then it is determined precisely by how many copies sell. If you make all copies free by making copying free, how is the value monetised? Copyright enables monetisation of copies, and hence of income to the author. The reduction in capital expense that you describe affects who may publish and how, which is a good thing, and reasonably should affect pricing -- as it very obviously has in the case of fonts --, but it doesn't change the situation of the author with regard to uncompensated exploitation of his work, including the exploitation of readers who want to enjoy what he has produced without paying him anything.</div>

<cite>How? Will authors be paid some sum up front to produce novels? Paid by whom? On what basis would the sum be calculated?</cite>

While this business model would result in grossly inadequate compensation for creators, it is not quite as totally unworkable as your questions suggest.

After all, people do get paid for, say, preparing the masters for printing ruled ledger paper, despite the fact that anyone can do it, so one could imagine novelists being paid on the same basis.

Thus, a society that saw novels as merely a way to promote the sale of newsprint, and which was content to have only as many works of real artistic merit as people might, as an amateur pursuit, make and give away for free, might feel entirely content to have no copyright laws.

In Canada, once upon a time, while music could be copyrighted, musical works weren't eligible for royalties until something like ten or twenty years after they were first published. Thus, while composers of works of enduring merit would be rewarded, those who composed ditties that were mere passing fads would not be.

One could easily imagine the United States, at some time in the 1950s, deciding  to adopt such a rule so as to destroy the music industry (this, of course, is before the RIAA had its lobbyists firmly in place) in order to save the nation's youth from the pernicious influences of that musical genre known as "rock and roll".

Sadly, artists and creators are not universally loved. But while musicians and composers are sometimes hated, the fate of type designers is more likely to be ignored and forgotten.</div>

That’s true, up to a point, and not quite in the way that you intended.

Originally, copyright was maintained by royalty to prevent the spread of seditious ideas.
That monopoly, lack of competition, and small runs of dull books, kept prices high.
When copyright was redistributed to publishers in the 18th century, it created a boom in books by the early 19th century, with lower prices and mass readership.

See St Clair:
http://www.amazon.com/The-Reading-Nation-Romantic-Period/dp/052181006X 

However, that was within countries. Internationally, there was no copyright!
The work of Charles Dickens, for instance, while protected in the UK, was pirated in the US, prior to the international agreements mid 19th century.

So the argument that the pre-digital international copyright paradigm established in the mid 19th century was favored because of the large investment required in authorship and publishing doesn’t make sense; it was political, driven by a sense of fair play. And Dickens’ celebrity advocacy.

In some ways, Dickens’ tour of the US was like a rock star today; he was making no money from book sales, although they had created his fame. He was selling tickets to speaking performances of his works, which he delivered with great drama.

I realize that there is a lot of pirated stuff on the Internet, and that some of the measures used for combating this have been intrusive in nature.

Still, I don't think one can conclude that copyright is dead. A balance is still possible, even if Big Content isn't currently interested.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The notion that the enforceability of laws determines what one should do, let alone what is just or fair, seems to me problematic, and certainly not grounds for just 'moving on'. I'm not wedded to intellectual property laws as they currently stand in particular jurisdictions or international agreements, but I am wedded to the idea that creative and intellectual works should materially benefit the people who create them, that this benefit should reflect the value generated by the work, and that this value should not be exploited by others without paying the creator. So there is no 'moving on', until there is a place to move to within which those considerations are substantively addressed. Until that happens, I expect we will see more, not less, heavy handed use of existing laws and, as a result, more concentration of intellectual property in the hands of corporations instead of individual creators, since it is the corporations that have the financial resources to take legal action against infringers.

Simply stating that the business model of generating income from creative works will shift from the selling of copies to production doesn't cut it, and I say that as someone whose income is almost entirely generated from production already. The particular business model under which Tiro operates works for a particular kind of product and a particular kind of client, and I see no reason to assume that it is scalable to the font business as a whole, let alone to other kinds of creative works. Are corporations going to fund the writing of novels to be bundled with other products?</div>

<cite>The notion that the enforceability of laws determines what one should do, let alone what is just or fair,</cite>

Enforceability definitely does not determine what is just or fair. But the costs of enforcing certain types of law do need to be considered - for example, if one of the costs of enforcing copyright laws was hobbling every personal computer so that it could not be used to run illegitimate software aimed at circumventing copy protection technology.

And the idea that enforceability can affect what laws should be enacted is an old one.

Thus, Blackstone's <em>Commentaries</em> gives an example of how armed robbery had the death penalty in France, but a lesser penalty in England - and, as a result, highwaymen were actually deterred from killing their victims in order to make themselves harder to identify in England.

The same principle explains why we don't execute rapists or put them away for life.</div>

What I have noticed in the 15+ years in which I have observed and engaged in debate on intellectual property, is that the people who argue that everything should be free tend also to want particular things, i.e. that they value certain things more than others, hence their insistence on the freedom of everything becomes simply the cheapest way to obtain the particular things that they want. Linking the payment for a thing to the purchasing of copies of a thing, or of licenses to use a copy of a thing, has long enabled monetisation of the actual value of creative works in the market, monetisation of how many people want them and how much. And this is what seems to me missing from the everything free model: the ability to capture value and monetise it for the creator.</div>

Why do you continue to distinguish between real and digital goods, and to do so with such excruciating vapidity? The only real difference is the MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. Simply because a digital file can be reproduced at essentially no cost does not change the nature of ANYTHING, you dope! Your cavalier equivocation only serves to make scofflaws feel somehow justified in their freebootery. OTOH, perhaps people don't pirate your digital goods as often as they steal mine.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, this is the second time recently you've been incredibly rude to me without any provocation and <em>in complete disregard of anything I have written</em>. Now I know you are having problems recently, but that doesn't get you a pass for treating other people like this. <em>I absolutely nowhere said that workers do not have rights to the fruits of their labour,</em> nor anything that could reasonably have led you to think that I believed that. This is, word for word, what I wrote ten short posts up this thread:

<blockquote>I am wedded to the idea that creative and intellectual works should materially benefit the people who create them, that this benefit should reflect the value generated by the work, and that this value should not be exploited by others without paying the creator.</blockquote>

Will you care to point out anything in that statement that would lead you to think that I don't believe workers have a right to the fruits of their labour? I am a worker and I live from the fruits of <em>my</em> labour. I don't have employees from whose labour I profit. If someone works with me on a project, he or she receives the same share of the fee as I would if I were doing the same work. If Tiro retains rights to what we make, then any designer who worked on the project will be entitled to a commensurate percentage of any profit generated from exploitation of those rights. Why? Because I believe that the people who make things should benefit materially from what they make. Get it? Whoever you think your enemy is, it ain't me.</div>

First, let me say that I think Luc has made considerable contributions to the typographic community through his tireless collecting of links and in many cases through synthesizing and assembling diverse information. So yay, Luc!

On the other hand....

"It's not like his site advocates some controversial opinions about typography."

Well, yes, it does. Luc advocates some bizarre views about the history of font formats. He's basically anti-copyright and pro- "fonts should all be free." He certainly ticked me off when I was working at Adobe and he linked to pirated Adobe fonts on his site.</div>

<cite>Simply because a digital file can be reproduced at essentially no cost does not change the nature of ANYTHING,</cite>

Well, it's true that it doesn't change the fact that a worker has the right to the fruits of his labor.

But there are other considerations. Basically, if each copy of a computer program has a value, then the more copies there are, the richer the world is.

Instead of using this fact as an excuse for piracy, however, it can be employed constructively: ergo, Linux.

So something is changed. And that's not the only thing; the fact that enforcement becomes more difficult does have to be considered as meaning that aggressive copyright enforcement could have a potential for intruding on our liberties.

That doesn't mean, though, that I agree that the Internet means copyright is dead - I just don't side with either extreme position on this issue, but instead I think both sides have a point.

When it comes to the other old issue - labor versus capital - the reason why there is a popular demand to bring in welfare measures, in my opinion, is because we live in a crowded world where people who can't find jobs on the terms set by employers no longer have the option of going out somewhere and homesteading. This is also why there is so much inter-ethnic violence in Third World countries.

Until there is some major advance in space travel - so that lead-acid car batteries could power an antigravity and FTL starship, so that any family could decide to head out and found a new planet (presumably with a nanotech terraforming kit) - we're just going to have to live with the problems and accept that we're not in a situation that permits standing on doctrinaire ideological positions.</div>

This may just be a problem with your <em>wording</em> rather than your actual <em>beliefs</em>, but you've just described something I don't think Thomas Jefferson actually believed in: the tyranny of the majority.

I don't think anyone here has argued against the principle of putting people in jail for violating the rights of others.

IP rights, however, are the artificial creation of governments, not natural law rights. Basically, states created those rights for the same reason they instituted the limited liability corporation: as a means of making themselves militarily stronger than their neighbors.

So if someone wants to argue for downgrading IP rights, while I may disagree, I'm not going to be mortally offended.</div>

Yes, I do believe there are natural law rights to one's property.

After all, without a right to property, it would be permissible to kill or enslave people, by taking away what they have prepared to sustain their lives, or the fruits of their labors.

Violations of intellectual property rights, though, don't involve taking, only copying. They don't directly make the victim poorer.

So if I hear an interesting story, telling that story to someone else does not injure the original storyteller (plagiarism being a separate issue). If  I see my neighbor employing a better way to thatch his hut, doing likewise does not injure my neighbor.

The acts of copying which constitute copyright and patent infringement only become wrong when someone has expended the effort to innovate in whole or in part because of a prior agreement to reward innovation through letters patent or rights of copying. Because copyright and patent laws have been enacted, violating them becomes essentially a form of the natural law crime of fraud.

But if nobody has given people promises that their clever new ideas won't be copied, then they would have to initiate force to stop others from copying them.

What does this mean?

Since we <em>do</em> have copyright laws, it doesn't mean that piracy is not wrong.

However, when Big Content refers to piracy as 'stealing' -

that's OK when they're talking to the general public for the purpose of telling them not to engage in piracy,

but it's genuinely misleading when they're talking to Congress for the purpose of <em>having the copyright laws changed</em> to provide more and better protection to content.

If copyright laws are an agreement by society to reward creators in return for more creations - then enacting them was a <em>discretionary act</em> by society, and there's no inherent moral obligation to extend those laws further (to make a longer term for copyright, to add new restrictions on things like tampering with your DVD player) if the costs of such measures are felt by society to exceed their benefits (in increasing or maintaining the flow of new creations).

The world doesn't owe artists a living for bad art - but it also doesn't even owe good artists a living: society at large isn't obligated morally to regard artistic creation, or technological innovation, as important or worth encouraging.

While the obligation isn't a <em>moral</em> one, though, there's a very strong case for a <strong>practical</strong> obligation to do so, particularly in the case of technological innovation. (Or, if you prefer, an indirect moral obligation - one owed to the beneficiaries of innovation, not the innovators.)

<cite>And please, if accusing 'John' of having his head up his arse, please clarify which John.</cite>

Well, I was the only one who referred to his 'wording'. So it was clear to me who he was referring to.</div>

You seem to argue against yourself in these two paragraphs. Insofar as the victim intends what he has created to be, like land cleared for planting or a house built not only to live in but as an asset, something he has prepared to sustain his life, violation of intellectual property while not as directly subtractive as theft of physical property is similarly an assault on his livelihood. Unauthorised copying devalues authorised copies by distorting the supply side of the economy and diverts income from the original creator to another party, taking away from the fruits of his labour. It enables other parties to exploit commercial value from what he has made without compensating him, i.e a theft of the fruits of inventiveness and labour that are properly his. [Remember, intellectual property law was not invented to deal with the case of individuals producing copies of things for their own personal use -- something that many jurisdictions explicitly permit for various kinds of works -- but to prevent commercial piracy. That is still its most important function, so far as I am concerned.]</div>

There is a distinction here, which I had not thought to make explicitly.

If someone plants crops to feed himself, stealing them prevents him from eating. The seeds directly grow into plants that bear fruit.

If a man writes stories, or invents things, in the hope of supporting himself thereby, <em>other people</em> are involved in the chain.

As I've noted, if he was entitled to expect his creativity would be repaid, by promises made to him, in the form of copyright and patent laws, then IP infringement <em>is</em> wrong, a form of fraud.

But absent such a commitment, where does he get a right to control what other people do, when they're not doing it to him, but only doing it with what they remember seeing him do?

If copyright were a natural law right, unilaterally imposing copyright rules would be self-defence, but that's not what it looks like to me.</div>

While Typophile threads such as this one

http://typophile.com/node/1492

are of very low quality, I think that the quality of this thread is not much better.

Whenever I was interested in a difficult topic, let's say copyright law, I read several scholarly books about the topic before I started to voice my opinions. Although my mother tongue is German and hence most books I read about copyright law are in German language, I even purchased a few British and American books about copyright law.

Looking at this low-quality thread, I think that none of those contributing to this thread ever bought a scholarly copyright handbook such as e.g. "Copinger & Skone James on Copyright". I think it does not harm to read this book before you start to voice your opinions about copyright law.</div>

Thank you for your frank assessment and contemptuously dismissive tone: it elevates the level of discourse ever so much, don't you think?

So, is there a Cliff Notes version—in English—of this precious tome, so that we all may bask in the gory of your considerable erudition on this vital subject?

BTW: “Violations of intellectual property rights, though, don't involve taking, only copying. They don't directly make the victim poorer” is, quite possibly, the stupidest thing I have ever heard…which, considering that Ryan posts here regularly, is saying a lot.

		<div class="commentbody">John, your distinction seems to risk limiting the scope of natural law to situations that preclude social relations.

I think you are leaning too heavily on the notion of 'entitlement', which as you note is easy to refute. Note that I nowhere suggested that a creative individual is entitled to income from his creations, any more than a man who plants crops is entitled to rain or a hunter is entitled to game. There is no entitlement, there is only reasonable expectation based on conditions. The conditions of obtaining income from creative works are demand and obligation. Demand is in the form of desire for the thing made, and the very fact that someone wants to copy the thing is evidence of the demand. This seems to me the point that you are missing: the demand, even when expressed in uncompensated exploitation, confirms the very reasonableness of the expectation that the thing made has value that may be monetised and produce income. And so we come back to my perennial theme: if a thing has value, the creator of the thing has a right to benefit from the exploitation of that value, and insofar as its exploitation by other people diminishes that benefit he is being wronged. This is where the condition of obligation lies.</div>

As fine an example of apples and oranges as I have ever seen: well done! A man who plants crops should enjoy a reasonable expectation of harvesting those crops. A hunter should enjoy a reasonable expectation of whatever fruits his labors may garnish, as well. Why is this simple point so difficult for you nimnuls to grasp?</div>

Geez. How about y'all come on down to Fort Myers Florida on Friday, January 18th for the Sunshine Blues Festival and chill out.  The Tedeschi Trucks Band (TTB) will be headlining and they are dynamite, trust me. And if a Derek Trucks slide guitar solo can't take your mind off the problems of the world, nothing can, you're hopeless.
The rest of the lineup is quite good, too. Two bandstands, starting at 12:00 PM.
<a href="http://www.sunshinebluesfestival.com/">Sunshine Blues Festival</a>
(I have no financial stake in this. I just dig the music and I'm happy it's happening near where I live. That's all.)
Given enough interest, on the next day, Saturday, I'll be proudly hosting the inaugural Blues In Type Conference - most likely in nearby North Naples. Details to be announced. 
There is much to discuss.</div>

Yes, I'll agree with that.

<cite>This seems to me the point that you are missing: the demand, even when expressed in uncompensated exploitation, confirms the very reasonableness of the expectation that the thing made has value that may be monetised and produce income. And so we come back to my perennial theme: if a thing has value, the creator of the thing has a right to benefit from the exploitation of that value, and insofar as its exploitation by other people diminishes that benefit he is being wronged.</cite>

And there's the point of the dispute. Absent some form of prior agreement - in the form of something like a copyright law - there doesn't seem to be a basis for an expectation or an obligation.

Maybe even under such circumstances there would be ways in which people's creative works could be exploited in a way the unfairness of which is clearly apparent. The history of typography does include examples of that, for example the cheap copies of the products of the Aldine press.

Because I feel that "A has a right to B" to be a very powerful statement - enough to justify, for example, the armed overthrow of governments to end slavery or other human rights violations - I wish to be very cautious in admitting natural law rights. Right now, I don't want to concede a theoretical basis to copyright law that would lead to our elected representatives feeling they have a <em>moral obligation</em> to give Big Content everything it wants - on which public debate is as irrelevant as, say, a public debate on turning back the clock on civil rights would be.

What is so threatening to creative people in the premise that copyright laws are something society has voluntarily agreed to give them? After all, the end result remains the same: piracy is both illegal and wrong. So their right to the fruits of their labor remains intact - until such time as society loses interest in encouraging creative work.

Which shouldn't be expected any time soon.</div>

Wherein the risk I see you taking of dismissing natural law as soon as social relations come into play. Whereas I see at least some conventional or civil law in terms of (imperfectly) balancing the natural rights of different people engaged in social relationships.

I do understand your caution when you say:

<em>Right now, I don't want to concede a theoretical basis to copyright law that would lead to our elected representatives feeling they have a moral obligation to give Big Content everything it wants</em>

But I think presuming that a natural basis of copyright automatically translates into giving corporate holders of intellectual property everything they want is as mistaken as assuming that striking down copyright and making everything free resolves the problem posed by those corporations.</div>

I've been on both ends of the spectrum, and I do retain an IP lawyer. I've been run over, and I've exploited system too. Believe me I know what I'm talking about.

If a person cannot pursue their own creative work from conception to completion ...and have that creative work protected as property owned by the creator then we as a democracy will fall.  Monetary prosperity is a right of birth as citizen of democracy.

Furthermore, I believe that to even have an Idea ...a single Idea that is of you and of no other... is a form of salvation in and of itself. And if that Idea can simply be 'taken' by another then the Individual will cease to exist, or at the very least ...get real nasty. 

And to push the conversation further down the road, just because someone has built an empire upon an Idea doesn't make them evil. It doesn't give cash strapped governments the right to create new taxation to exploit those that have managed to survive the development of their own personal creativity.

The conversation of the Have and the Have Nots is built primarily on the right to pursue an Idea. The 99% vs the 1% conversation is trivial at best and at its worst is a conversation designed remove intellectual property rights all together.

That latter position I definitely agree to be mistaken, and it is not a position I take. All I'm asking for is recognition that copyright is a social choice, as opposed to a moral obligation. That, to me, seems like a middle road between "striking down copyright" and giving in to its abuses.</div>

Copyright is a particular legal implementation, varying in its terms between jurisdictions. As I wrote much earlier in this thread, I am not committed to particular legal implementations, and they are by their nature in the manner of civil conventions or, as you say, social choice. I do believe, however, that these particular laws reflect a sense of underlying moral obligation, and at their best seek to balance that obligation with others, including the individual's obligation to society (hence the temporal limits placed on copyright).</div>

And as for the comment about 'temporal limits placed on copyright', those limits (max out between 95-120 years I believe in the US) are to protect the creator of the works ...and not their decedents. Which makes perfect sense to me because as a nation of Individuals nobody wants to subjugate themselves anyways.  

Those limitations are not a social obligation. They are there to encourage and foster an environment of creativity and not one of dependency.

I didn't say anything about government per se. Insofar as particular laws represent the social contracts by which people choose to conduct their life together in society, how those laws are arrived at  -- by government as most people commonly understand it, as an entity of state, or by mutual consensus or by dictat -- is mostly irrelevant to the discussion. We have laws, however arrived at, and the best of these laws seek to reflect, however imperfectly, what we communally sense to be our moral obligations to each other, and to balance the sometimes competing rights of different individuals, groups and society as a whole. The worst of our laws are expressions of arbitrary power, and serve as an indication that something is wrong with our polity, and <em>that</em> is where the matter of how the laws are arrived at become relevant.

One could frame the current discussion, as it relates to what is happening in the field of intellectual property law, as being about whether copyright legislation is (still) a reflection of a moral obligation to recognise and respect creative works as belonging to their creators -- and note that UK copyright law includes rights that are specifically identified as moral --, or threatens to become an expression of arbitrary power of what John calls 'Big Content' in collusion with a bought-and-sold polity.</div>

All I was trying to indicate was the difference between written law with prosecution as a deterrent and moral sense of what you may understand to be wrong but are not legally prevented from doing.  Sociopaths have no sense of moral obligation or even a conscience to give them a poke so it never occurs to them to avoid activities (such as theft) which many of us find morally wrong regardless of secular laws. Even those who are not sociopaths but simply are greedy and criminal just ignore "that little voice" which says "don't do that, it is wrong."</div>

As for the argument regarding copyright infringement and intellectual property— it is quite redundant.  There will always be people who steal and pirate online resources; no law or form of enforcement will ever be able to stop it.  Take comfort knowing that most of these kids that pirate "your" copyrighted property will probably never use it because they received it in a 10,000+ Font Collection torrent.

To me, a 'telecaster' is a television broadcaster, and so I had to Google to confirm what context seemed to imply: that a Telecaster was something similar to a Stratocaster (i.e., a brand of electric guitar made by Fender).</div>

Typical misinterpretation mostly due to superficial thinking. Even in the few post that follow yours they correctly pronounce what drives China ...the Individual spirit of America. That's what created those legendary guitars... NOT the spirit of China ...LOL!!!

That spirit of America comes from its founding fathers... try as other countries might there's no amount of knock-offs that will ever ever own America. 

Ask yourself this... Why is America so inventive and China so dependent feeding from the trough ??? Which nation is a nation of cattle?

America owns China and always will... sad to say.

And BTW, it is very encouraging to see that since China has joined the G20 they have started to enforce some international IP laws as outlined under the Berne Convention and WIPO. Yes, they have a long long way to go to regain global trust but at least they have started on the right path.

One thing about America: we do seem to have a knack for "getting there first".  I assume that all the parts of an iPhone are manufactured in Asia. Yet the iPhone was conceived and introduced in America.

But innovation only creates jobs for a few people, so if the manufacturing takes place abroad, what happens to the broad masses of common people?

If we make it into a religious dogma that protectionism is evil, we cannot even address the issue of mass unemployment. So demagogues will bring about the collapse of our societies, because the few governed them to suit themselves.

Energy independence with nuclear power, and full employment put first, with imports limited to using the foreign exchange actually earned through exports - it is not "inevitable" that we fail to adopt simple common-sense remedies to keep history from repeating itself.

Yes, there certainly IS a lot of technical innovation that's born outside the good old US of A. I was thinking of Sony in their heyday as I wrote the sentence - I deserved to be called out on it.

		<div class="commentbody">I think we need a separate board for these sorts of downward spiralling, in-fighting, thread-killing bitch-sessions. We can call it “Bitch bitch.”

It can also be a place for typographers to hang out and simply chat about stuff that has nothing to do with type. Actually that’s a real thing in forums. And I think it’s a good thing. The purpose is two-fold.

1. It lessens over-moderating and censoring. It’s an open community, and if someone tells you what to do, you’ll simply leave = self defeating.

2. It removes noise that works against from the purpose of the forum. Too much infighting &c? Newcomers don’t like the place, and leave = inevitable death.

Pretty simple math from where I stand.

And the latter has been brought up in more than one thread in the last few months as a significant deterrent, and reason to leave, for newcomers <em>and</em> long standing members.

Please. Think about the forum before yourself.

Note that the record illustrated in Figure 1, while it effectively conveys the two-word phrase it is intended to illustrate, is not an example of the actual item referenced.

That is, it is a record that will not play at all, as opposed to one which, due to a scratch, will cause the stylus to jump back to a previous position in the spiral groove, thus causing the endless repetition of a portion of the content.</div>

Dissent is democracy. And in it's purest form a democracy functions best when the Individual is unencumbered, either by religion or government.  It's not a matter of extremes, it's a matter of finding the middle ground for the Individual to flourish.

And if you flourish ...so do I. If you can make it, so can I. You lift me up.

Forgive me saying this but, America is not an empire. It is what you'd call a groove, a vibe, a spirit of independence. I've personally felt that vibe coming from 1 American the same as coming from 1,000,000+ Americans. And it is that 'free will' that can build whatever it wants. And if and when that 'construction' falls ...it is the spirit of America that will rise above all and rebuild. 

America will always rise above itself. Not because of its material content but rather because of its spirit of independents as seen in everyone of its Individuals. In short, America is not measured by its army, not measured by its economy or by its many accomplishments. America is measured by the strength it gives to the Individual.

America is freedom.

So, imho, to bring this back around to Luc  ...dissent is democracy. It is the divergent opinion which defines independence a.k.a. democracy as a whole.

Fahrenheit 451 notwithstanding, though, how does using TrueType instead of bitmap fonts - bitmap fonts being used on systems with less processing power available, but now even tablets and cell phones have enough power that this doesn't apply to them - interfere with people being able to read?

Particularly as bitmap fonts tend to be low-res, although I know there were laser printers that used 300 dpi bitmap fonts.</div>

'You miss too much these days if you stop to think' ... U2

The decline of dissent is brought on by those who can baffle brains ...Obama's hope poster readily comes to mind. Interesting that I'd bring that up in a thread which talks about IP rights. Obama endorsed a poster done by a guy who is, and always has been, known as an expert plagiarist.

Hook, line, and sinker.

The ability to read or the curtailment thereof is not what dummies down social dissent. What is written does.  When people see a crack in the facade they begin to question the foundation. And that is what leads to dissent.

Well, that is what <em>used</em> to happen with people were actually literate—you know: beatniks and hippies and such. Now, due to the enormous excess of superfluous information on the web and on phones, there <em>is</em> no foundation: an ad-hocracy rules.

Oh, no; it isn't over-the-top to say that something which negatively impacts the quality of type would harm reading.

I just had not realized that vector fonts had that effect; or, for that matter, technologies like Clear Type for antialiasing, if that was what you're really referring to (they seem to massively improve the appearance of type when resolution is limited).</div>

If people bother reading. When you remove reading from the equation entirely, nobody even has a chance of promulgating thoughts that can lead to real dissent.

All this talk of social media fomenting political upheaval is bunk: all it's doing is helping to replace dysfunctional formal systems with lynch mobs. This only really benefits rival dysfunctional formal systems. :-/  Orange Revolution, Arab Spring, all a joke at the expense of peons.

<blockquote>the internet has short-circuited rational thinking…</blockquote>

It must depend on the person, because in my case it has helped me think more and more deeply; partly because it has helped me learn more and more deeply. Because I read instead of watching YouTube.

<blockquote>I just had not realized that vector fonts had that effect</blockquote>

Whenever you address something besides what's really going on, pixels*, you can't hope to be optimal. Now, vectors can be made to fall pretty neatly on pixels (hinting) but it's such an unnatural uphill fight that it was bound to lead to abandonment. Just like how ATF incorporated optical scaling into their pantograph, but eventually nobody was using that feature, they just made all the sizes from one master. Result: save money at the expense of reading. Capitalism and Culture are not friends.

* And broadening this I would say it's the same problem with chirography: it addresses "expanded skeletons", while in reality it's all about the limen.

<cite>All this talk of social media fomenting political upheaval is bunk: all it's doing is helping to replace dysfunctional formal systems with lynch mobs. This only really benefits rival dysfunctional formal systems. :-/ Orange Revolution, Arab Spring, all a joke at the expense of peons.</cite>

Of course, this isn't exactly <em>new</em>. The French Revolution, the Russian Revolution... and the collapse of the Roman Empire were all used as examples in British education about history of how terrible it is to fall prey to the seductive calls of demagogues.

Of course, all that education somehow didn't inspire the rich in Britain to avoid the excesses of the Industrial Revolution.

If you don't want the misery of a demagogic revolution and the tyranny that follows - if the privileged don't want to lose their places to a new political elite - the obvious thing to seek is a humane economic system which brings jobs to everyone and minimizes discontent.</div>

Capitalism is the method by which we can determine your worth.

Sure politics have some weight, critics too, but at the end of the day it is the character of your typeface which will determine its value ...and mine too. And yes, everybody does deserve a payable job ... so long as it's not the same job. Clearly your typeface will be of more use than mine, therefore it is of a higher value ...mine is of a lesser value. And as the author of your typeface, your property can be protected via copyrights. 

Your unique ability to create something of value makes you separate. It makes you separate from me and everyone else. It makes you an Individual. An Individual with rights and freedoms.

Weights and measures, that's what Capitalism gives to society as a whole.

<cite>But make sure Culture doesn't get short shrift,</cite>

Well, the Nazis tried to promote culture, although they never seemed to get beyond kitsch.

The Communists in Russia had the ballet, and chess, and symphony orchestras. North Korea is also big on music.

So high culture can just be window dressing for tyranny; what the masses need so as not to "live by bread alone" is not so much culture <em>per se</em> as <em>freedom</em> - and to be equipped for <em>critical thinking</em>.

<em>Some</em> forms of culture help that - specifically literature. And I'm sure that's what you really were thinking of in this connection.</div>

Capitalism, with its freedom of expression and market forces, is the most fertile ground for Culture to take root. Simply look at the most recent Cultural development ...graffiti. And look to Basquiat, Haring, Banksy, et al... to see the impact of Capitalism as a fertile ground. 

Despite your spite, Capitalism has pushed forward that funky little thing called Culture. And in doing so letter shapes in general and to certain extent graphic design (including typography) have greatly benefited!!

If I was in a give-me-everything society where the spirit is comfortably numb, I wouldn't be half as inspired as I am in a society of Capitalism.

Commerce is everything. 

Royal patronage, communist patronage, dictatorial patronage, whatever, all have made some form of manipulated contribution to Culture but it is Commerce ... and especially in its purest form of Capitalism ... which has proven to be the most fertile ground for Culture to flourish. Why? Because it is a dynamic environment it energizes the spirit!

Where would the graphic arts be without the merchant class of Tokugawa Japan? Where would be the academic arts be without the House of Medici (et al)? As for Culture developed in and of  Native / Indigenous peoples ... as awesome as it is it's dated and locked / frozen in time.

Commerce pushes the spirit that's when Culture advances.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, yes, there's also Stalin and Mao. Accepting Leni Rifenstahl's craftsmanship, while deploring the uses to which it was put, is simply an honest way of facing both sides of the situation: where the problem is, though, is in the failure of the relevant artistic community to acknowledge theat Sergei Eisenstein is similarly problematic.

Hitler is special simply because World War II impacted even people living in secure first-world nations like France, Britain, and the United States. Not because those people are "better" than, say, the Vietnamese or the Armenians or the Copts, but they are wealthier and more powerful.

It's not about fairness. It's about the stupidity of picking on someone who is quite capable of fighting back, of picking on someone who is bigger than you are. Vide 9/11.

It amazes me that there are <em>still</em> parts of the Muslim world where non-Muslims are not equal, and where noises are made about how awful Israel is. Of course, though, apparently irrational behavior is a natural result of having to take care of the short term before there even <em>is</em> a long term to worry about.</div>

Your naïveté and your lack of compassion for the rest of humanity are both absolutely stunning. I have no “brand of socialism”: I merely advocate Social Justice for all, have-nots and well as haves.

Yes, greed is found everywhere. Toss a one-inch (25.4mm) square of white bread into an area where sparrows are feeding and you may witness the “I've Got the Big Piece of Bread” game: the males will fight each other for possession of this Object of Desire, but it won’t get eaten until it is torn apart in some confrontation. Squirrels are greedy when they discover oily seeds, probably because their high fat content adds to the squirrels’ myelin sheath, thus making it smarter. Anyone who has attempted to hang a birdfeeder and make it squirrel-proof can attest the the fact that the little buggers are Evil Geniuses—considerably smarter than dogs.

Saint Adam of Smith sanctified Greed as a Positive Social Benefit—via his Invisible Hand bullsh*t—and relentless pimping of this notion since has elevated Greed to the Ultimate Social Good. You may find this state of affairs acceptable; I do not. If we don’t reverse course—and soon—we will arrive at the Point of No Return in Capitalism’ relentless campaign to trash the planet. I would prefer that this did not happen…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oldnick, you'll be pleased to know that I single handedly defeated Squirrel Nation. 

For sometime now my elegant bird feeder design has comfortably thwarted any and all squirrel assaults. In fact the birds that come to feed everyday (some half dozen+ species ) are so comfortable they aren't scared off when the cute furry rodents try and try again to assault their feeder whilst they are feeding! Just last week I put out some peanut butter on the bird feeder just to watch Squirrel Nation fail.

Squirrel Nation is very persistent.

The fatal flaw in the evolution of the Squirrel's anatomy is its vestigial 'thumb' of their front feet. Ergo, they can't really grip an object like a human can grip an object ...squirrels only have a 'stub' of a bone structure which only provides a 'pad' for a fifth appendage of their front feet.  

In my area we have tons of black squirrels, gray squirrels, red squirrels, and monster sized chipmunks too.

All bow their heads when I walk by.

Consider your “victory” short-lived. And almost-opposable thumbs is a design flaw? What an odd conclusion to draw…

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb

Awhile back, I undertook an experiment to establish a relationship with one particular squirrel. As an incentive to cooperation, I provided treats which the squirrel was not likely to encounter—in this case, Turkish pistachios at ten dollars a pound. After a week, when I was fairly confident that the squirrel knew that I was his benefactor, I entreated him—through various hand gestures—to amaze me. Well, one gesture I tried—I am not absolutely certain which—encouraged him to do just that: amaze me. 
He was in a crape myrtle tree with fourteen separate trunks, none more than a meter or so from its polar opposite. The squirrel proceeded to ricochet off the branches, with absolute precision, and at a very snappy—and accelerating— pace.

I normally do not use this expression, because it is so sorely abused, but this display was <strong>F*CKING AWESOME!!!</strong> After five or six times around, the squirrel paused for my reaction. Quite naturally, I bowed to the Master: Ninja Squirrel rules. I am fairly confident that any dog, witnessing this display, would give paws (ouch!) to the notion of ever again chasing a squirrel. OTOH, I would LOVE to have the squirrel repeat the performance with <strong>me inside the tree</strong>—not bloody likely (s0 far), but a breathtakingly spectacular prospect.

I might add, as a footnote, that my bow appears to have affected the larger squirrel population. My local squirrels no longer run away furiously when they see dogs on leashes; rather, they gambol off playfully—perhaps to taunt the poor dogs. At least one of the local dogs has sussed out that I may be the responsible party: she has taken to barking at me from time to time—which is unusual, because I speak Dog rather fluently, and generally enjoy a quite friendly relationship with them…</div>

That continues to be true: the United States continues to pursue two wars whose sole <em>raison d’être</em> is capitalist access to the natural resources of the people who actually live in the countries we’ve invaded. It’s the same thing we did in Vietnam; although, thanks to technology, far fewer front-line soldiers  than the 58,000 who died losing the war in Vietnam are now dying in Afghanistan, the main theater. The U.S. will, of course, lose this war, too: ask the British and the Russians…

BTW, Neil: here’s your precious Capitalism at work…

Yeah, right.

As if the war in Afghanistan wasn't about bringing Osama bin Laden to justice for 9/11, and continues because it's about stamping out the Taliban to protect the Afghan people from them. No, it's all about becoming able to exploit their copper and other minerals.

As if the war in Iraq wasn't about how that country's regime, which was allowed to continue after being defeated in the war it started to invade Kuwait, hadn't defied the conditions of the peace treaty by hampering UN weapons inspectors seeking to prevent that rogue nation from gaining weapons of mass destruction - and continues because terrorists are menacing the ordinary Iraqi people. No, it's all about stealing their oil.

After 9/11, any radical Muslim - by this I mean one that is willing to use force, not in self defense, but to impose either his brand of Islam, or subservience towards those who practise it, on others, instead of living side by side with them in peace and tolerance - should consider his days are numbered. So, just as Pearl Harbor was good news for the British, 9/11 was good news for the Coptic Christians and other minorities - as well as for Israel.

It's about ending an ideology that has proven itself a menace to the lives of Americans peacefully going about their daily lives, not about oil.

Also, your use of the word "capitalist" makes me wonder if you are confused about the horrors of the Soviet totalitarian regime - and how, therefore, the Arab oil embargo of 1973, inspired by that part of the world's petty quarrel with Israel, coming as it did <em>during</em> the Cold War, constituted treason against humanity.

Israel only expanded after the Arab world tried to throw it into the sea, and it was only founded - instead of Jews simply living as citizens of Palestine - because of violent attacks against Jews in Palestine. But in 1967, and again in 1973, the Arab world, instead of accepting the consequences of its wrongdoing, and leaving well enough alone, dug itself in deeper.

<cite>The U.S. will, of course, lose this war, too: ask the British and the Russians…</cite>

It's not as if the U.S. is trying to impose things on the Afghan people; it's fighting a very small band of terrorists. The <em>war</em> is already over, the Taliban have been defeated, and Hamid Karzai now governs Afghanistan; the U.S. is simply assisting the new state in dealing with a menace to order in its midst.

Pakistan might be the Taliban's Cambodia, but they don't <em>have</em> a North Vietnam.</div>

But John, you are indeed being entirely too naive. And in the context of the world there's nothing "peaceful" about how America has been behaving since day one (the American Indian genocide being one of the saddest events in all of human history - much worse than the Armenian Genocide). The fact that it feels relatively peaceful on our little island is a "feature", and only makes long-term resolution more elusive.

John: please get a clue. The East India Company started as a corporation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company#Founding

Eventually, the cost of containing native populations became prohibitive, and the East India Company managed to convince the British citizenry that the taming of the savage was England’s Manifest Destiny; consequently, the British population assumed the financial burden of this Grand Enterprise and, in the process, drew their famous Red Line around 40% of the world’s nations.

From its beginnings, the United States armed forces have effectively been goon squads, who work for the highest bidder (which lately has been, quite often, British Petroleum). American politicians appear to be particularly effective at turning these ventures into Holy Wars of one kind or another. In fact, one such Holy War is being pimped now: Israel is begging the world to save the Civilized Man (in other words, Israeli Jews) from the Savage (that is, Iran, successor to the the Persian Empire, which was far more vast, influential and civilized than the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah ever were).</div>

Hm... that's a tuffy to answer. If I say No ... then that implies that I'm always wrong. If, on the other hand, I say Yes, then that implies that I'm always wrong.

Seriously oldnick stop sounding like an Obama socialist, ok? Instead, try asking questions that will shape a healthy exchange. Asking questions you've already answered is being left of left .... Obama² ...lol!! 

You're trying to paint Israel as the bad guy, and Hamas as the good guy. That my fiend is going to require a lot of paint and a very very wide brush!!

A: Stolen.

One can definitely cite a lot of bad things in American history, like the "Trail of Tears", for one example.

Nearly all of human history has been the story of the wars fought between one unjust, repressive regime and another unjust, repressive regime.

But the Western world of today is pretty much the one place and time where an intelligent young man can live with honor without having to pay with his life - not being forced, in order to survive, to turn people in to the secret police, or to obsequiously sing the praises of the local tyrant, or to give silent assent to lies in order to avoid threatening the local religious sect.

For this, it is reasonable to give the West some gratitude, and to assist in protecting it from its enemies.

The West is the heir to ancient Greece, in which the valuable accomplishments of the ages are respected and preserved and built upon. Thus, it must survive and prevail, or humanity will have wasted millenia in its struggle to give meaning and purpose to its past ages of suffering.</div>

Thanks for answering the question: no, you never tire of being wrong. The inferences you draw have no relation to what I actually say.

Obama socialist? Where did you get that preposterous notion? Obama is as much a corporate stooge as the next guy; worse, he’s an Oreo, whose misguided Affirmative Action programs are settling race relations back sixty years or more. Furthermore, I never mentioned Hamas; I said that Israelis—despite their protestations—are not behaving morally, and have no claim whatsoever to the title “Civilized Men.”

		<div class="commentbody">I've felt that U.S. politics have been dysfunctional ever since LBJ.

In John F. Kennedy, America had a President who was what a President <em>should</em> be: on the one hand, someone who stood for the rights of minorities and women to equality, and who recognized the economic interests of the ordinary working man as vital to the nation, and on the other hand, someone who was a strong champion of liberty against the dictatorships which were hostile to the Free World.

Compare that to the 2008 election.

George W. Bush's statesmanlike and responsible response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (he didn't go and nuke Afghanistan, like <em>some</em> people were advocating; he didn't even convert the Islamic world to Christianity at gunpoint as someone else advocated, possibly in jest) was met with howls of outrage by the Democratic Party. Bush had to be defeated, or the world was doomed!

And so the Democratic Party, leading up to 2008, had a primary process in which the leading candidates were an African-American and a woman.

It's critical to defeat the Republicans, in order to prevent World War III, and instead of choosing a safe, electable candidate, you're going to indulge yourself in a long-shot attempt to make history?

And, indeed, once chosen, Obama promised to irresponsibly pull America out of Afghanistan and Iraq regardless of whether or not that would lead to the terrorists taking control of those countries.

In the case of Afghanistan, though, he was honest enough to relent <em>before</em> the election.

McCain was narrowly ahead; some commentators speculated on the "unthinkable" - if another 9/11 happened before the election, he would win in a landslide instead of squeaking through.

Well, it happened - just in the other way. The stock market crashed.

This pushed voters towards the Democratic party, the party of FDR - the party that cares about whether working-class Americans have jobs.

<em>And then McCain was so out of touch that he did a Herbert Hoover impression in response to the crash...</em> noting that the fundamentals of the economy were sound.

America wasn't ready for a black President - but the perfect storm happened.

But that election was just an extreme example of what had been true in just about every election - Humphrey versus Nixon, Mondale versus Reagan - the voters are presented with a Hobson's choice between someone who will neglect national security and someone who will neglect the economy and the less fortunate.</div>

It's true he didn't really have UN permission to invade Iraq. And, I suppose he could have waited to see if Afghanistan's offer to subject Osama bin Laden to an Islamic trial was genuine or useful; after all, we might not <em>like</em> the Taliban, but they were the government of Afghanistan, and one is supposed to respect the sovereignity of national governments.

However, several thousand innocent Americans were killed out of the blue.

Many Americans did favor, seriously or not, the simple visceral response of using America's thermonuclear might to turn Afghanistan into a lake... or to wipe Islam from the face of the Earth. <em>That</em> kind of thing didn't happen.

So I'm just using a different value of "compared to what" than liberals might, reminding them that while Bush may have fallen short of their hopes, he still remained well within the realm of conventional actions, and in no way approached their worst fears.</div>

Chris—

I am saying that an Independent Contractor—masquerading as a police officer and working for person or persons unknown—coaxed my apartment manager into filing three bogus charges against me, which resulted in my being arrested, brutalized twice, knocked on the noggin hard enough to cause my brain to bleed, then tossed into the Restricted Issue division of the Fairfax County Jail, with the intent of intimidating me, and, I suppose, to “change my attitude”—precisely why, I am not certain, but the most likely reason is the <strong>major flaw</strong> in the ACH check-processing system which I accidentally stumbled upon, and then announced to the world. Well, okay, not the world: here and on Craigslist. Or, maybe, people just find me annoying: I don’t know. In the process, my common-law rights were violated and my civil rights were violated. I will spare you the gruesome details.

The Supreme Court ruled that Independent Contractors working abroad are, essentially, above the law. Call me paranoid if you wish, but my experiences lead me to believe that some contractors working in this country operate as if the same were true on American soil. So, DHS is the most likely culprit…IMHO.
