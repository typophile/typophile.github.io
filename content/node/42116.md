  bit of the same help. Im applying to school for advertising; part of their admissions
  requirements is a home test in which one of the assignments is to create a b/w logo
  for a fictional company called \"Overnight Express\". No other information is included
  so I had went under the assumption it was a shipping company. Below is what i've
  created... plz rip me apart =]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overnight

    at my work at an inch square - about the size it would appear on a business card.
    I simplify (and simplify) until it's recognizable at a glance when it's THAT small.
    \r\n\r\nGradients are never a good idea in a logo - they don't reproduce well
    on photocopies or faxes. \r\n\r\nThe font looks smashed together on the left and
    too spaced on the right; but before you work on kerning, look around at other
    fonts. All caps doesn't score high for readability, but I think you could find
    something more elegant. <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfontspecimens\">Neutra
    Display Bold </a>comes to mind."

    'draw this turtle and get your degree-by-mail' type of test.\r\n\r\nTelling you
    to design a logo sans any actual business requirements, goals, or context is just,
    well, ignorant of them.\r\n\r\nI do like eeblet's idea...food chain...bullet train...escort
    service...you could have fun with it."

  body: "i see your point aluminum, i left out some info in my orig post i guess cuz
    it seemed irrelevant, but this is only part of the application; in addition, a
    traditional art portfolio and 4 other (non-design related) assignments from the
    home test is required. i think its purpose is to get a general sense of potential
    from the applicant. i dont think this one design is the make or break point of
    acceptance; but rather it helps get better insight on any artistic design aptitude
    that may not be apparent elsewhere in the portfolio? they also want the preliminary
    sketches along with the final product, so i think its a measure of conceptual
    process as well. but what do i know....all speculation. but anyway, this is for
    the art and design school of FIT-\r\n\r\nlol @ escort service; but id rather not
    joke around too much with it just incase the admissions officers dont get my sense
    of humor and tell me to gtfo"

    the logo being used as a 3/4-inch diameter rubber stamp that gets photocopied
    a few times and then faxed. If the logo won't survive that kind of treatment,
    it's probably too complex.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "but you said it yourself that the application process is looking for other
    aptitudes of creativity. maybe thinking outside of the box is one of those? usually
    is in my opinion. yes, we know overnight has a lot to do with shipping and express
    is fast and the two together means fedex or something of the like, but really.
    a thoughtful and witty approach to such an open ended thing is probably where
    they are trying to see who goes beyond the everday monkey thinking and steps it
    up.\r\n\r\nif it were me that would be the first thing i'd look for.\r\n\r\ni
    agree with the other comments. gradients = bad and so on... maybe there's a better
    way of visualizing night/day than a gradient (if that IS what you were trying
    to do and not just be 'cool') keep pushing.\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: hm, so im back at the drawing board... i see the arguments raised about staying
    away from gradients in order to satisfy mechanicals cross-media wise; i will take
    that into consideration... i really appreciate the advice everyone has given!
    im learning already and i didnt even get accepted yet

  body: "I question somewhat the value of this forum helping you on your application.
    \ If I'm wrong, please tell me, but I'd think the purpose of the application is
    to assess your background and at what level you'd enter the school. If we contribute
    too much to your final result, it kinda skews the school's perception, doesn't
    it?  Anyway, if I think back to my entrance portfolio for school, it was absolutely
    abysmal.  I'm still shocked that I was let in.\r\n\r\nIn short, I would push yourself
    to create the best logo you can, but don't overdo it.  If you're only 16 or 17,
    you shouldn't be expected to design like a pro (or even close to one).  As someone
    pointed out, this is likely to be more a test of your thinking than your actual
    design ability anyway. That's what you are going to learn in school."

  body: "@jonsel,\r\n\r\nI see your point, though I disagree.. I think this forum
    is highly valuable and very helpful in my case. About the school's perception
    being skewed, maybe if I were to ask someone else to do the work for me, but I'm
    not here looking for a handout; rather just a critique, some advice and direction.
    In the end, it will still be my own creation, the difference is that I took the
    time to apply independent research to create a better product. I think its fair
    game. \r\n\r\nIt's a competitive portfolio so they'll axe the worst... and that
    scares me to death! (Its all or nothing for me, Im 24, skipped out on college,
    and 2.0 HS GPA, so i need to leverage my artwork into getting accepted). Ive been
    drawing all my life so i think my fine art is pretty good... but im not really
    knowledgeable about logo design. \r\n\r\nBottom line is I would like to advance
    my knowledge as best I can in order to deliver the highest quality work possible
    at time of my review. Again, its competitive, so i'm under the assumption my competitors
    are on design forums also. (Quite possibly even reading this =\\ )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand
    @alum, Will,\r\n\r\ni wouldnt doubt that for a minute... i self taught myself
    everything i knew that got me my current job (im in IT), but i hate it...! Kinda
    the reason im going back to school. Trying to get a decent paying job in NY without
    a degree is almost impossible! (i got lucky)"
