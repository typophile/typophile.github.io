body: "The <em>Dutch Type Library</em> and <em>URW++ Design & Development</em> proudly
  present <strong>DTL OTMaster</strong> (OTM), a highly sophisticated application
  for reviewing, editing and saving tables of fonts with a snft file structure, as
  there are CFF and TTF flavored <strong>OpenType</strong> fonts, <strong>TrueType</strong>
  fonts and <strong>TrueType Collection</strong> fonts.\r\n\r\nFont editors, like
  for instance the <strong>DTL FontMaster</strong> suite, <strong>FontLab Studio</strong>
  and <strong>FontForge</strong>, rely on their own internal data formats for type
  design and font production. From these data, binary fonts for the end-user are compiled
  as the last step in the font production process.\r\n<strong>OTM</strong> is a tool
  for inspecting and adjusting such binary fonts, irrespective of the font editor
  used for their creation.\r\n\r\n<strong>OTM</strong> makes the editing of tables
  possible from a <strong>graphical user interface</strong>. It comes with built-in
  tools like the <em>Glyph Editor</em> for proofing and editing contours or even drawing
  glyphs from scratch. A &lsquo;kern&rsquo; Table Viewer is available for proofing
  and refining the kerning, and a &lsquo;GSUB&rsquo;/&lsquo;GPOS&rsquo; Viewer to
  visually test (and in case of GPOS also adjust) these OpenType Layout tables.\r\n\r\n<strong>DTL
  OTMaster</strong> was programmed in Hamburg, Germany at <em>URW++ Design & Development</em>,
  renowned for pioneering in the field of font technology development for more than
  thirty years. The <strong>FM Team</strong> (Dr. Juergen Willrodt, Axel Stoltenberg,
  Hartmut Schwarz, Peter Rosenfeld and Frank E. Blokland) was joined by Karsten Luecke
  as advisor and also author of the extensive and detailed <em>OTM manual</em> and
  Nikola Djurek for the design of the function icons.\r\n\r\n<strong>OTM</strong>
  is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Free <strong>Light versions</strong>
  are available for: <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_Light_1.0.0_MAC.zip\"><strong>Mac
  OS X</strong> (download)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_Light_1.0.0_WIN.zip\"><strong>Windows</strong>
  (download)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_Light_1.0.0_LIN.tgz\"><strong>Linux</strong>
  (download)</a>. \r\n\r\nThe downloads also contain the <em>OTM manual</em> in PDF
  format.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_scrndmp_small_5025.gif]"

    ...'\r\n\r\nThanks for the compliment. This is another one (especially Dr. Juergen
    Willrodt deserves the credits here) by Dr. Ken Lunde, Sr. Computer Scientist at
    Adobe, on Thomas Phinney's blog (http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/01/dtl-otmaster/):\r\n'As
    someone who works with OpenType fonts on an every-day basis, and with the tools
    that are used to build and check them, I would like to state here that DTL OTMaster
    is a fabulous tool. The best way for me to characterize it is that it gives me
    the power of AFDKO\u2019s \u201Cspot\u201D tool, and that of TTX, but wrapped
    up in nice GUI. It handles CJK fonts well, including those with a large number
    of glyphs. I especially appreciate that there is a Mac OS X version, because that
    is the OS that I use.'\r\n\r\nAzizMostafa: \u2018Please allow 2 weeks to explore
    it.\u2019\r\n\r\nOTM supports mark positioning lookups and can display them. These
    mark to base, mark to mark and mark to ligature positions are editable in OTM.
    They are also supported when a features file is imported. Since OTM is based on
    the latest version of the Adobe SDK it supports the GPOS mark features and one
    can create a GPOS table from the features file. \r\n\r\nI wrote: 'The downloads
    also contain the OTM manual in PDF format.' and I would like to add here that
    version 1.5 of the OpenType specs is attached and linked to the manual, thanks
    to the permission granted by Microsoft."

    new version (2.0.0) of DTL OTMaster is available now.</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe
    functionality of DTL OTMaster has been enhanced considerably in the new 2.0.0
    version. For instance the <em>Glyph Editor</em> now supports the option to import

    the full version lets you do surgery. I value having the full version because
    I sometimes need to perform post-production operations on font data, because in
    my workflow a TTF or OTF becomes the source format for OTL and hinting work. But
    if one has a workflow in which a program like FontLab remains the source format
    throughout, up to the point of final font generation, then OTM is useful as a
    means of examining generated fonts, quality assurance, etc. and you only need
    the light version.'

  body: "Indeed, I consider OTMaster Light a very powerful \"in-depth font viewer\".
    For example, its Tools/'GPOS'/'GSUB' Table Viewer is a quite powerful and useful
    tool to examine the functionality of the compiled OpenType Layout tables. \r\n\r\nTypeSupply
    FeatureProof [1] offers a similar functionality, but OTMaster is much more robust
    with more complicated fonts (e.g. complex-script fonts for Indic languages, which
    FeatureProof simply does not open at all). Also, OTMaster works on both Mac OS
    X and Windows, while FeatureProof is Mac-only. On the other hand, FeatureProof
    offers a more practical interface for testing contextual OpenType Layout features
    in a \"real text string\". \r\n\r\nAnd yes, indeed, the full version of OTMaster
    allows you to edit pretty much any aspect of the low-level structures of a TrueType
    or OpenType font. TTX/FontTools [2] allows pretty much the same, but in a rather
    different manner: OTMaster offers a graphical user interface while TTX/FontTools
    allows the user to convert an entire TTF or OTF font (or one selected table) into
    XML, edit the XML in a text editor, and convert it back into a font. Also, installing
    and setting up TTX/FontTools can be challenging for some users, while OTMaster
    works \"out of the box\". \r\n\r\nBoth working manners have their advantages.
    If you need to make more changes, the XML workflow (through TTX/FontTools) can
    be more efficient, but for a simple fix or two in a font, OTMaster is the better
    solution. \r\n\r\nI definitely think DTL OTMaster is an excellent product. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n[1]

    OTMaster can be used to export OpenType layout tables present in a font. The exported
    OpenType layout features &#xFB01;les can be read-in directly without any alterations.
    And although the way the exported features are listed could be different (due
    to the inevitable interpretation of the binary tables) from the features-description
    that was used for generating the font originally, the functionality should be
    completely identical. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nOTM 2.4 supports the latest AFDKO 2.5 build
    and can be used to update the OpenType layout features in a font. Any OpenType
    layout features &#xFB01;le with the AFDKO syntax can be imported, even if the
    listed features are not covered by the font&rsquo;s character set. The modi&#xFB01;ed
    Hatch OpenType (&lsquo;HOT&rsquo;) tool will remove the none-covered features
    during font generation. Of course, to make all applicable features work, the character
    naming convention should be identical in both the font and the OpenType layout
    features &#xFB01;le.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_240_2_3725.jpg]\r\nThe
    <em>OTF Consistency Checker</em> in OTM 2.4 contains a new, extensive, &lsquo;Language&rsquo;

  body: "I can also attest that the AFDKO functionality of DTL OTMaster 2.4 is great.
    \r\n\r\n1. The export of AFDKO feature definition files from existing OpenType
    fonts has been improved so now OTMaster can export the code in such a way that
    AFDKO 2.5-compatible compilers such as MakeOTF, Fontographer 5 or the upcoming
    FontLab Studio 5.1 can easily compile it, problem-free. \r\n\r\n2. The intelligent
    subsetting of the AFDKO code works very well. If your glyph naming is consistent,
    you can use one large AFDKO file that covers the largest possible glyph set. You
    can import it into any font that uses the same glyph names, and OTMaster will
    only add the feature definitions that are covered by the glyph set. \r\n\r\nAn
    example on how this can be used: \r\n\r\nOpen a large multi-script OpenType font
    in OTMaster, export the AFDKO code, open the same OpenType font in a font editor
    such as Fontographer or FontLab Studio or even TypeTool, remove some glyphs, generate
    the font, open it in OTMaster and import the previously exported AFDKO code. The
    rules or lookups that no longer apply to the font (because the relevant glyphs
    are no longer present) will be transparently ignored, and only features that are
    covered will be included. \r\n\r\nIn fact, you can then export the AFDKO file
    again from that font, and then you'll get the subsetted AFDKO file. So rather
    than removing lines of code by hand, editing your classes etc., you just use OTMaster
    as a \"filter\" that will process your code. You can then, perhaps, make some
    small changes to that new, subsetted AFDKO file, and take it into any tool such
    as FontLab Studio, Fontographer or MakeOTF. \r\n\r\nOf course this means that
    you can have a large \"master\" AFDKO feature definition file, and use OTMaster
    to add the code to any font you're making, regardless of the actual glyph set.
    You can either import the AFDKO file in OTMaster and then save the new OpenType
    font (with features included) right from OTMaster, or -- if you want ultimate
    control -- import the master AFDKO file into the font in OTMaster and then export
    it again: then you'll get the custom-tailored AFDKO file, and you can perform
    some additional manual edits (e.g. if you have some special \"calt\" or \"ssXX\"
    features which are not present in your master file). \r\n\r\nThis is, potentially,
    a huge time-saver for people making OpenType fonts. \r\n\r\nLast year, I've started
    using OTMaster as the final step of font production, after generating the font
    from Fontographer or FontLab Studio. OTMaster gives you a low-level OpenType-spec-native
    view at the font, quite like FontTools/TTX, but wrapped in a quite clean user
    interface. \r\n\r\nOTMaster is a great \"illustrator\" for the OpenType spec.
    If you want to take the step of reading through the OpenType spec at some point
    (which I do recommend if you are developing fonts), reading the spec is much more
    pleasant if you open a font in OTMaster and view the actual tables organization
    and values. This will help you understand the spec much better. I hope for many
    of you, if you do this, it'll allow your brain to make \"click\" at some point,
    and you'll quite likely be able to finally \"get\" the inside structure of OpenType
    font. IMO, that's tremendously helpful. \r\n\r\nThe trial version of version 2.4
    is not available. OTMaster Light 2.0 is the latest trial version available. As
    a trial, it works quite well. You can familiarize yourself with the tool and see
    whether it's any good for you, in general. Also, there's a small video that I've
    created showing DTL OTMaster in action. The video is based on OTMaster 2.3, so
    some of the new features are not shown. \r\n\r\nDTL OTMaster 2.4 will be available
    shortly at \r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/dtl-urw-font-utilities/dtl-otmaster/\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

    or piano of a type designer &ndash; it focuses on the creative aspects of making
    fonts. FontLab Studio offers creative tools and a fair bit of engineering gear.
    But DTL OTMaster is a true font engineering tool that allows you to control the
    final quality of your digital font files. In this talk, Adam will show how these

    be really nice, but even just editable RGBA values would be welcome.
