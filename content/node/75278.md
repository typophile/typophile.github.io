  body: "thanks.\r\n\r\nGDandT doesn't have it, but it would be a good font to have
    included it\r\nI haven't looked at Code2000 but I will when I get home.\r\n\r\nI
    thought Sego was a bundled Windows font, but I don't have it.  Hmm...\r\n\r\nthe
    symbol is in Cambia Math alright, but it is out of proportion with the rest of
    the font. With the symbol at 9 points it is the same saze as the rest of the font
    at 11 points. I also think the symbol looks kind of goofy with serifs, but maybe
    that's just me.\r\n\r\nI took the time to do what I could have done bearlier and
    scrolled though all the fonts on this computer.\r\n\r\nHere's what I found:\r\n\r\nArial
    Unicode has a serifed centre-line symbol (why serifs?)\r\nCambria Math \r\nIsocp
    (CAD font*) \r\nIsoteur (CAD font)\r\nRoman S (a monoline serif CAD font made
    of  multiple line segments )\r\nSimplex (sans serif CAD font made of multiple
    line segments )\r\n\r\nPalitino shows a nice little spiral for that glyph.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    is for dimensions and specs on shop drawings, for which I perfer a sans serif.
    I tend to use Calibri.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Using <a href=\"http://earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/\">UnicodeChecker</a>
    on the Mac, I find this symbol in Apple Symbol (serifs), Arial Unicode MS (oddly,
    also with serifs -- don't the MS type designers know a serif from a sans?), Code2000,
    Geneva (finally as a sans!), and ... in Helvetica!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since
    you are on Windows: this Helvetica is an Apple dfont that came with the system:
    \"\xA9 1990-2006 Apple Computer Inc. \xA9 1981 Linotype AG \xA9 1990-91 Type Solutions
    Inc.\", v. 6.1d18e1."

    had a serif design and the designers just copied it? Current code-charts show
    a sans design. \r\n"
