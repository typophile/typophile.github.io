  typewriter as his muse, [[http://www.fontbureau.com/people/MatthewButterick/|Matthew
  Butterick]] set out to make a monospaced font that preserved the liveliness & comfortable
  readability of a proportional design. [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AlixFB/|FB
  Alix]] was inspired by IBM\u2019s Prestige, a \u201950s stalwart, but features true
  cursive italics, not sloped variants. An OpenType set of proportional alternates
  allows for more conventional text fitting while retaining the classic typewriter
  look; FB 2011\r\n\r\n4 Styles: Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic\r\n\r\nFB Alix
  is available as OpenType fonts with oldstyle figures and stylistic alternates.\r\n"
