  body: As far as I know it&#39;s exclusively Lineto. I know, they are pricey.  <BR>Sagmeister
    can afford those fonts, the rest of us cannot.

  body: You could always try other fonts in the vernacular/industrial vein, like Garage
    Gothic from Font Bureau, or Emigre&#39;s Platelet.

  body: Thanks Heinrich!  <BR>Your NOGA is a very nice face. Very clean and modern.
    I like the numbers too; except the Gravur Condensed is rounded on the edges. I
    will definately keep you in mind for my future uses! Does it come with Oblique
    and/or light styles too?

    target="_blank"> FF Isonorm 3098</a> for this rounded  <BR>&#34;technical drawing&#34;
    feel. At $99 for 4 weights it&#39;s a  <BR>bargain. And Mecanorma has a <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=AG71943001P1&amp;start=1"
    target="_blank"> single weight</a> for $22! <BR> <BR>&#40;I prefer the Lineto
    version though. They&#39;ve really got <BR>some killer deigns over there.&#41;

  body: 'What works very nicely -- at least it did for me -- is to use Isonorm Monospaced
    and add 10% weight to it FontLab or some tool like that -- by using the fully
    automated process. This rather weird process results in a very vernacular typeface
    that is strangely rounded and feels strangely un-designed.  <BR>The only irritating
    thing about Lineto is the pricing in Schweizer Franken. I tried to contact Wendlin
    and Co about Euro pricings for Courier Sans, but to no avail... '
