  be the development of a small computer interface with a basic LCD seven segment
  display (like a heart rate monitor, bike computer etc).\r\n\r\nIn order to take
  the display from a boring 'sourced straight from china' watch display, I'd like
  to look into using a more interesting 7 segment font. I realise there are significant
  restrictions on segment shape etc in order to maintain readability.. just wondering
  if anyone had dealt with anything similar in the past?\r\n\r\nAny ideas, leads etc
  are most welcome...\r\n\r\nCheers."

    see the approach for 6 segment...

    \r\n\r\nI also have one of my own that legibly eliminates the bottom segment and

    - i like your approach in eliminating the bottom segment - esp. given it can be
    retrofit around an existing display architechture - which is of particular concern
    for this project as developing a new display layout with diferent segments, you
    need to re-program the IC chip and i think need to produce some ungodly amount
    like 100k units to make it worthwhile for the factory... so if we could go with
    an existing IC chip and just re-design the font.. that's a little easier to swallow.\r\n\r\nCertainly
    some good food for thought.. i wonder if a fairly geometric typeface like DIN
    could be modified to become a 'somewhat-respectable number-of-segments' display..
    Here's an <a href=\"http://au.nixonnow.com/watches/mens/the-connect-A069.html\">example</a>
    that's heavy on the segments.."
