		<div class="commentbody"> Richard is right that good spacing reduces kerning. But it&#39;s also very true that many designers &#40;especially &#34;anglos&#34;&#41; don&#39;t pay kerning its due respect. <BR> <BR>ville/Helle, <BR>It&#39;s possible to write a book on your question! And such a book might contain as many questions as answers... But: <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re starting from scratch, make two lists, one that contains right-hand &#34;exceptions&#34; and one that contains left-hand. An exception is a character &#40;or actually a glyph&#41; whose profile &#40;left or right&#41; is irregular beyond a certain threshold. For example, the right side of the lc &#34;t&#34; is almost always an exception; while the left side of the lc &#34;a&#34; is &#42;sometimes&#42; an exception &#40;think of designs like those of Gudrun Zapf von Hesse&#41;. The threshold depends a lot on the level of quality you want, in terms of the number of pairs you&#39;ll end up with. After you have the two lists, match up each right-exception member with all the left-exception members, and for each pair decide how much &#40;if any&#41; adjustment is needed. <BR> <BR>To me this is the ideal method if you make few fonts. But if you make a living in type design, it&#39;s more cost-effective to make a list of pairs &#40;or get one from an expert - just make sure he/she is &#42;really&#42; good&#41; and just check those. But  if you do that you always have to stay on your toes - lest you miss something parrticular to the design at hand. <BR> <BR>Also note that pairs aren&#39;t enough by themselves. Since we generally read word shapes &#40;not individual letters&#41; it&#39;s important to test words, of course. But that&#39;s a different book. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Yeah, that&#39;s a great page - I&#39;d forgotten about that. <BR> <BR>The only thing that bugs me about it is its heavy reliance on control strings. They&#39;re certainly a great basic tool &#40;I use them a lot, just like everybody else&#41;, but they do contain a danger: real language is not &#34;ooonoonononnonnn&#34;, and sometimes control strings mislead. The best example I can think of is the letter &#34;oh&#34;: if you look at a well-spaced font you&#39;ll notice that its sidebearings are much tighter than a control-string method would generate, and the designer has compensated for the method&#39;s shortfall &#34;manually&#34;, probably by just going in and tightening all the round characters after having done the control-string method. &#40;The reason rounds need to be tighter is simply because round-round adjacency is rare in actual language&#41;. Another example is the most common English word, &#34;the&#34;: when you rely exclusively on control strings it doesn&#39;t come out very nice. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Hold everything. What I&#39;m talking about is not &#34;professional&#34; at all - maybe it could be called &#34;academic&#34;. In fact it&#39;s a waste of time if you&#39;re trying to make as much money as possible. But I&#39;d like to think that there are better reasons to design type, or at least to attain a level of quality irrespective of finances. <BR> <BR>From what I can tell most people use variations/extensions of Tracy&#39;s system, which is indeed based on control strings. But even as Tracy states, the eye is the &#34;final arbiter&#34;, which means it&#39;s not &#34;illegal&#34; to make the &#34;o&#34; tighter for example. But the eye cannot know linguistics - the &#42;mind&#42; has to help advance the quality of the spacing beyond merely control strings &#43; guesswork. <BR> <BR>The way I do my own spacing is actually a diluted version of my &#34;ideal&#34; method, but I think it&#39;s still more demanding than what the average designer does. <BR> <BR>I do the base spacing with control strings pretty much in the Tracy way, but then I tighten the round sidebearings, and apply certain other adjustements &#40;like loosen the lc &#34;el&#34; - to give it more presence in a word - set the word &#34;million&#34; to see&#41;, then I test with the most frequent digraphs and trigraphs, then I test with the most frequent English words &#40;I should do more than English, but...&#41;, then I test with a list of rare but &#34;problematic&#34; words. Linguistics also applies in kerning, simply because some pairs are more important than others. That&#39;s the gist of it - and I&#39;m really not too happy with it - because I have dreams of what spacing &#42;could&#42; be... <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, I&#39;m late but you might find this useful: <BR> <BR>Anyone who thinks spacing and kerning is an unnecessarily tedious process is right. Computers are designed to automate repetitive tasks. To that end, please read pages 424-436 of <A HREF="http://www.font.to/downloads/FL45WinManual.pdf" TARGET="_top">the FontLab 4.5 manual</A> and spend a minute calculating the time you will save. <BR> <BR>Yes, FontStudio had something like this, but FL&#39;s version is truly astounding.
