    asked about his favorite font, Shantanu said that Warnock was an amazing series
    of fonts. When the reporter looked confused (didn't recognize the name), Shantanu
    asked if he was familiar with our founder John Warnock. In the fact-checking stage,
    we clarified that Shantanu's favorite font is Warnock Pro but did not get into
    its origins.\r\n\r\nThe reporter likely deduced from the name of the fonts, and
    then Shantanu's reference to John, that John created the fonts. This of course
    is not the case, and Shantanu didn't say so.\r\n\r\nBut given that it was a positive
    story, and a very logical misunderstanding (not a willful or sloppy mistake),
    Adobe PR didn't feel it was necessary to follow up with a request for correction.\r\nHowever,
    they'll be sure to be more precise if the question arises again.\r\n\r\nIt's actually

    a partial quote or misquote was to blame. And the fact that the font was referred
    to as \u2018Warnock fonts\u2019 and not \u2018Warnock Pro\u2019 suggested that
    the PR handlers were out of the room, or had less grasp of Adobe fonts than the
    boss. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, in 100 or 150 years, in type history books, Dr
    Warnock will likely be more closely associated with the Adobe originals library
    than the individual designers. In much the same way as Stanley Morrison is associated
    with the Monotype revivals. Sadly many in-house designers, even the best of them,
    will be at best a footnote.   \r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not all doom-and-gloom. One
    of the things that makes the font biz special is that the individual designers
    are credited \u2013 every school kid knows who made Comic Sans, Verdana and Myriad,
    but what name do you associate with Mac OS X, Windows Vista, Photoshop CS3? Probably
    someone who contributed little if any code to the product.  \r\n\r\nFinally the
    conspiracy theories that have sprung up around Tom\u2019s reply show why the PR
    folks often feel it\u2019s better not to correct obvious errors.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    finally, how about Adobe in Seattle - birthplace of PageMaker and InDesign and
    home to Tom Phinney - it may not be as huge-mungus, but it's still important. "

    Slimbach and Thomas Phinney for at least three years and neither one of them ever
    knew who I was or what I did.  In fact I'm pretty sure I could rob Robert in broad
    daylight and if I faced him later in a police lineup he would say, 'I never saw
    that man before in my life.' They were both pretty much off in their own world,
    which is okay, since it looks like they haven't been too harsh on others doing
    the same.
