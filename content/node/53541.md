  from World War One.\r\n\r\nI love the lettering. It makes be think of a unique version
  of Futura/Neutraface.\r\n\r\nHere are some pics: http://www.flickr.com/photos/armorath/sets/72157612566497775/\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know the history of this sort of type? \r\n\r\nAs this sample is from 1925,
  and Australia, I assumed it was not inspired by Futura or Neutraface.\r\n\r\nI find
  the wide A's in the names kind of weird, but i love the condensed W's.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n**EDIT**
  I've attached some pics here, more on flickr.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3198008179_386cf0397b_5046.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3197973225_133a2c8d90_4849.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3197965249_6c8f1ac112_4632.jpg]"

  body: ok, on closer inspection i see it not really like Futura really. i think what
    made me think that is that it seems to be trying to be a modern, progressive sans,
    yet it has some very weird traits. (like that wide A and narrow M)

  body: "This shows the influence of Edward Johnston's alphabet designed for the London
    Underground about 12 years earlier, but it ain't type. Almost all large lettering
    (more than a couple of inches high) on non-paper substrates was done by hand until
    the 1970s. That's the beauty of old signs like the one in this post: \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/53548\r\nPeople
    apprenticed as sign painters (Eric Gill learned letter design as a stonecutter),
    and art schools taught students to render display alphabets.\r\nFew people bother
    to learn these skills now. Why should they, when they can make good money by taking
    any old font and blowing it up to 1296 point? "

    skill in rendering the letters.\r\n\r\neven though they are hand done, would htey
    have been based on type? like would the signpainter use a specimen book as a guide?"
