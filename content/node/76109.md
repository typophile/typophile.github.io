  it\r\n[[http://nossovinho.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Obra-prima.jpg]]\r\n\r\nI
  need to make a bottle shot, but i can't find the label of the wine I actually need
  (madrigal chardonnay-Chenin), so I was hoping to recreate their label layout\r\nIF
  I can figure out the name of the typeface\r\n\r\nthanks"
