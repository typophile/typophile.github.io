  this interface element? And if not, is there any other standard symbol that does
  the job? I did some research but no luck so far, but some references show there
  might be such a symbol.\r\n\r\nAny help will be much appreciated."

    a vertical line one pixel thick (regardless of font size) on the left hand-side
    of the following Em-square (or at the right-hand side of the previous glyph).\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm really saying is the the relative thickness of the cursor (which flashes on
    an off) changes and so there is not a standard cursor thickness common throughout.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    around here will be able to clarify."
