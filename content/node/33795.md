  G. Mason and chemistry graduate student Carlos J. Hernandez produced particles that
  are just microns wide and shaped like each letter of the alphabet. Graduate student
  James Wilking used \"laser tweezers\" to pick up the letters 'U, C, L, A' and move
  them in order.\"\r\n\r\nBe sure to click \"Next\" for the second image too. "

    gets cooking,\" there's a story with a little more detail, including this:\r\n\r\n\"The
    letters could be manufactured to conform to a variety of typefaces, even something
    like the Times New Roman font favored by many newspapers.\" \r\n\r\nHard to tell
    if \"even something...\" means that they don't like TNR, or that they think it
    would be a great achievement to duplicate it."
