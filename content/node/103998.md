body: "Over the last year or so I've grown quite interested in (roughly) nineteenth-century
  face styles around the Bell, Oxford/Monticello and Scotch Roman evolutionary tree.
  \ For a while now I've been working on designing a typeface based on some of the
  ideas I've had along these lines.\r\n\r\nW.A. Dwiggins famously set out to tame
  Scotch Roman by blending it with modern features from William Martin's work, resulting
  in Caledonia.  I wanted to try moving in arguably the opposite direction: exploring
  the possibilities found in Scotch's immediate precedents among the transitional
  types.\r\n\r\nThis is what I've come up with.  I took some basic ideas from Scotch
  and Bell and tried to create something with a crisp and rational structure but a
  touch of nineteenth-century ornamentation. \r\n\r\nI haven't settled on a final
  name for it yet. For the time being I've dubbed it 'Alexandrina' because it strikes
  me as vaguely Victorian. (A nod to any who get the reference.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alexandrina_5136.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  basically aiming for something that's good for captions and relatively short snippets
  of text, but could be used more generally without causing serious problems.  I think
  it probably works best at around 12-15 point.\r\n\r\nI have alternate versions of
  /f, /g, and /t which I'm thinking should be made default at 12 point size and below.
  \ (The last paragraph in the PDF shows the use of these alternates in a 12-point
  paragraph.)\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure about a few points...\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I'm not
  sure if the ampersand works.  It looked nice when I sketched it on paper, but after
  creating the outline I'm not so convinced.\r\n<li>I'm not happy about the @ sign...
  not only is it pretty generic but I don't think it's all that well drawn.  (This
  is by far the hardest character for me to draw, as a rule.)\r\n<li>The numbers need
  a bit more work still.\r\n<li>I think some of the symbols are probably a bit too
  light.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks..."

    the width of the counter. I suspect when your /c/o/ is next to /b/d/p/q/, the
    former will look too wide or the latter too narrow, unless you make those counters
    closer to each other in area. '

    do think the changed ampersand works better.  I've also lightened /4 and tweaked
    a couple of other numerals.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of text is indeed somewhat improved.

  body: The triangular spurs on {b q} strike me as a bit jarring among the otherwise
    quite organic forms. Maybe give it an ever so slight concave curve? And/or a finite-width
    point?

  body: "Those proportions are starting to click.\r\nNow I would reconsider the serif-length.
    Upper- and lowercase serifs don't have to match, but maybe they should be a little
    closer to each other than you have here.\r\nAlso, watch for where too much bracketing
    is creating black spots in the capitals, perhaps in places like inside lower left
    of D and E and inside lower right of K, and definitely in the interior acute serif
    angles of the thick stroke of X. I'd just try a \"smaller radius\" curve in those
    spots (with the K you could try a one-sided serif or other terminal for the leg).
    \r\nYou might have too much overshoot (see the bottom of the stem vs. the bowl
    of /d/). "

  body: "@eliason You're probably correct about the caps, thanks.  I know /4 isn't
    right yet, I've already lightened it some but I will have to go further.  (The
    crossbar is actually thinner than the /2 base, it just looks darker next to the
    heavy stem. Need to revisit some of what's going on there.)\r\n\r\n/o is slightly
    narrower than /b /d if you include the serifs in the calculation. The curve itself
    is broader but I happen to like the way it looks. Do you think it's a real problem,
    or just unexpected?\r\n\r\nRe ampersand, I may end up pointing the terminal to
    the right instead (it should help with the awkward spacing issues the character
    currently has).\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!"

  body: "@eliason Yes, I find overshoot a bit tricky to calculate optimally.  I'll
    take another look at those.  I'm also glad you commented on the inside curve of
    /B /D /E: I'd been wondering about that myself, so the fact that somebody else
    shares my concern is a good sign that it does need adjusting. :)  \r\n\r\nI was
    also wondering about the lowercase serif length earlier today, although I'm concerned
    about preserving good text readability.  (I may yet decide to fork this into separate
    display & text versions, but I'm still undecided.)\r\n\r\n@Catharsis Something
    closer to what the spur on /G does, perhaps... e.g. something like the following
    (blue = existing, black = suggested), maybe?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alexandrina2_5096.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
    to both of you for the helpful feedback!"

    slightly in /B /D /E.\r\n\r\nI've also shortened the horizontal serifs on the

    ones slightly as well.\r\n\r\nI've lightened /4 a little, although I'm aware that
    it (and the numbers in general) still needs more work. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone think
    the /a is too narrow?  It looks fine on screen, and at display size, but when
    I print it out at text size it looks awkwardly narrow next to the /e when the
