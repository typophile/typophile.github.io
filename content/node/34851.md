  fonts [[http://virusfonts.com/spec%20sheets/tourette.html|\"tourette\"]].  Namely,
  typefaces that use long, thin lines with a sort of ornate or disturbing quality.
  \ I'm quite confident I'm going to have to create a custom font for this project
  but I could use some inspiration!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
