  I love that A, that M and that R... it kind of feels familiar, somehow...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id_julioverne_3738.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id_marmores_3511.png]\r\n\r\nI
  tried Identifont, but got nothing...\r\n\r\nruD"

  body: "Oops, sorry... should've been more specific. It's not that old; it's just
    that I'm 22, so pretty much everything's old... :P I don't remember the date,
    but I'd say it was probably from the 70's... maybe mid 70's.\r\n\r\nSorry for
    the delay, too, and thank you in advance for your patience and your help. :)\r\n\r\nruD"

  body: "Well, 1970's is still pretty much pre-digital. PostScript and TrueType were
    developed in the mid-to late-80's I believe. The 70's were part of the era of
    film types, such as Photo-Lettering.\r\n\r\nI know, this is trivia. I still have
    no idea about this typeface, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "House's <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfonts\">Neutraface</a>
    has an R and M that are somewhat like this, but the flat top A looks like very
    old typefaces (around 1900).\r\n\r\nFor example, see Solotype's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/berolina/\">Berolina</a>.
    Someone more persistent than I am could set 'RAM' as the sample and scan the entire
    sans collections for the best matches, but I don't think my day will be THAT slow
    today. (Although I have been known to do such things..)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    for those of you who are interested, it came up with some interesting alternatives:\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/yearnboy/14/\">YearnBoy 14</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/fenwick/light/\">Fenwick</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-qtype/square-book/\">QType Square
    -- Book</a>\r\n\r\nNothing quite the same, though...\r\n\r\nThanks anyway, Mike.
    And while it may be trivia, it's always helpful for newbies like myself! :)\r\n\r\nruD"

    you had the way to move points around (Illustrator, or Fontographer, for example).
    That's what I'd use as a starting point, from what I've seen.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
