body: What do you call the part that sticks out of a capital Q? Is there a name for
  it? What would you refer to it as if you were designing something and needed to
  write about that part of the q?

    correct.

  body: While the original poster's second post might have inspired someone to cite
    an anecdote concerning Abraham Lincoln, I think it's entirely reasonable to wonder
    if there wasn't some specific technical name for the stroke which distinguishes
    a Q from an O. Appendage, terminus, <em>cauda</em>, tail... or some other word,
    unique to the rarefied reaches of typography.
