  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there peoples  <BR> <BR>I am pretty new to this site - but as i understand, you can get some really good feeback. <BR> <BR>Which is basically my reason for this post&hellip; <BR> <BR>The situation is like this : i am designing a 30 page booklet that is targeting 12 - 17 year old males. The problem that i face is - weather to use Univers for the main body copy and find a font that is quite expressive for the titles  <BR>OR  <BR>Should i just use univers for the whole booklet ?  <BR> <BR>I know that its not really good to mix and match typefaces but i feel / fear that the booklets type might look a bit stale - so to speak. <BR> <BR>When I say stale i mean the type becomes very percise and lacks the visual characteristics that help relate the subject content to the audience. <BR> <BR>Hopefully that makes sense to everyone. <BR> <BR>And hopefully you could give me some advice that might help me. <BR> <BR> <BR>thanks heaps  <BR>eye_mac</div>

Most would not feature Univers.  <BR> <BR>Having said that, 12-17 year old males are as varied as any group. Good, attractive design should be your goal. (Although I'd probably steer clear of flowing calligraphy for this group.)</div>

I agree with John, lots of Univers is not suitable for text. There are alot of type designers here that will give you better choices.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you're targeting 12-17 year olds, aim at the 15-17 year olds and the younger ones will follow. Univers probably isn't the best choice, particularly if it has to carry the weight of the booklet's image. It's not a great font for lengthy running copy, but it's not as though you're setting the thing in an illegible novelty font. <BR> <BR>If you're set on Univers for the body, I'd definitely add some life with an interesting titling font. By the way, try out Univers 45 (light) for the body copy. With the right handling, I prefer it over 55 (regular). Without specifics on the content, I can't get more specific on the fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks to all those whom have replied - i appreciate your expertise - very much. <BR> <BR>And just to answer the question about the body copy - well its about nutrition etc - its designed for sporting kidds between 12 - 17, like i saud earlier. <BR> <BR>Well with all that was said - i think its back to the drawing board - i did not know that univers was such a poor type - its such a large family and is often talked about in the design / typography books.  <BR> <BR>Its interesting - thanks again</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There's nothing wrong with Univers per se, it's just that it might be a little too corporate/clean for this audience.  <BR> <BR>But if the booklet isn't too copy heavy (2-3 paragraphs per page), you could get away with Univers for body copy, pairing it with (as others have suggested) a more expressive headline face. <BR> <BR>You certainly wouldn't be the first to use Univers as a text face. Take a look at Wired magazine, which uses the regular and condensed versions for most of its body copy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The following fonts are from small, independent designers and foundries, yet the quality is first class. Beware of settling for Univers. Save it for the annual report (or not). All of the following collections offer fonts that are at least as hip as Emigre (more in my opinion) and have less exposure.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeco/trapper/" target="_blank">Trapper</a> - The printed samples look great with all caps in display and text set at 7pt. <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeco/chunkfeeder/" target="_blank">Chunkfeeder</a> - Another interesting display text combo. It really comes into it's own in the 5pt text size. <BR> <BR>Check out <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html" target="_blank">PSY/OPS</a> for interesting options in text. <BR><a href="http://www.macrhino.com" target="_blank">Mac Rhino</a> has some fabulous stuff. <BR>Peter Bruhn at <a href="http://www.fountain.nu" target="_blank">Fountain</a>.
