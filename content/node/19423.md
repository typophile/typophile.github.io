  a chair influenced by an art movement. I was given Basel. I have read many pages
  on the school, instructors, and students but am having difficulty narrowing down
  what exactly the Basel movement is. Any insight to this would be greatly appreciated.
  thanks"

    movements?  In the 50's karl Gerstner began to contribute to both art and design
    in Basel. He still lives there as an artist and from then to the present day has
    been a prolific creator of 'Concrete' art. This is like constrcuctive art but
    leaning a little more towards suprematism; the work refers to itself only, does
    not represent anything in the way abstract work does.\r\n\r\nWith research I'm
    sure you would be able to uncover other artist based in Basel mid-late century
    who's practice was based around this principal. Interestingly Basel lies at the
    point where Switzerland, France and Germany meet. This made it a very active area,
    drawing influence from germany and it's early pioners who were at the front of
    constructive art.\r\n\r\nWith little factual knoledge I guess that during and
    after the second world war Basel was a slightly more attractive place for those
    artists and designers not wanting to flee as far away as America. It is more than
    likely that I'm way off the scent but my reflex reaction is to propose the Basel
    movement in art did revolve around mathematical, systematic, process based work
    and took place in the 50's and 60's. I believe Switzerland to be a large inspiration
    to the Minimalist movement that took place in America in the 60's.\r\n\r\nFor
    me this is quite interesting so people with real knoledge would not only be helping
    Brice."

    and the successor (i think it was named) of the  Kunstgewerbeschule Basel.

  body: 'What is/was Basel school? It is a visual, tactile, intellectual and strategic
    way of developing an understanding and knowhow about creating powerful visual
    messages. Yes there is/was a Basel style, but people who emphasize that miss the
    point. The school teaches a complex and unique way of approaching--in my case,
    graphic design--that will propel students forward into communicators who look
    at the design business as a way to solve problems in new and different ways. Even
    more impt than that, solutions that are relevant and appropriate, first, to the
    organizations for whom they are designing. The words to describe this unusually
    advanced school are: innovation, change, growth. Personally, my three year experience
    at the Basel school was intense--both emotionally, intellectually, and visually.
    Hoffman, Hauert, Weingart, and VonArx opened up an enttirely new world for me..
    and propelled me into a deeper, more satisfying visual life that I might not otherwise
    have had. I don''t do much designing any more. I paint full time. But I will tell
    you, in my painting, I am pulling together all the principles I learned in Basel.
    My approach is complex--but of course it would be. I learned from some of the
    most remarkable teachers in the design world at that time. I am grateful beyond
    words. I would not be where I am today without the intensity and diversity of
    thsiis forward-pushing, intellectually challenging school with its teachers. I
    also have my classmates to thank as well. They were and still are awesome in their
    own right. Bill Schorner, April Greiman, Ken Komai, and Dan Friedman coem immediately
    to mind. I hope this helps. It is not about the Swiss style. That is not the Basel
    school. It is much deeper. thanks Jack D.    <http://www.dickersonart.com>'

  body: "One of Hofmann's legendary teaching methods included the following trick:
    \r\n\r\nThe students were given a few simple three-dimensional objects - cubes,
    cuboids - which they had to put together to form a three-dimensional composition.
    When the students presented their three-dimensional composition, Hofmann would
    swipe it away and tell the students to rebuild it exactly the way it was before.
    In most cases the students were not able to rebuild it, but Hofmann of course
    could.\r\n\r\nIn his own work it was always a process which led him to a specific
    result."
