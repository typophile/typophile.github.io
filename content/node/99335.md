  body: "Since the \"t\" is most probably modified, many of the other glyphs might
    also be modified... which would mean finding the source font won't get you all
    the way there. But if finding the source font would still be useful, focus on
    the caps, since they seem unmodified; the \"E\" in particular should narrow things
    down nicely.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
