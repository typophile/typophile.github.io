  body: "Way, way off! I just tried writing Geisha with this in TextEdit & it actually
    looks quite convincing as a flowing handwritten brush script using just five or
    six strokes. Most of the letters are set to join very nicely. I actually find
    it surprisingly good for a freeware script. \r\n\r\nI don't know what effect they
    were trying for in the example above."
