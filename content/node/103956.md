body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI am currently working on a logo design for a company that delivers
  high quality services for the petrol industry. They needed a logo with a modern
  feeling, making them feel established and safe to work with (as they are dealing
  with big numbers, that was a priority). The client wanted something with a helvetica-ish
  feeling, making them look professional and that they are operating worldwide.\r\n\r\nHere
  are some of the final concepts I am working on, I would be delighted to have your
  opinion on it :)\r\n\r\n "

  body: "You've definitely achieved \"Helvetica-like\" and \"professional.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    middle version, with the italicized \"international,\" has the most contrast (big-small,
    Roman-italic). Make sure that \"international\" is still legible when you use
    the logo at your desired size (and that no strokes break up on the printer).\r\n\r\nOverlapping
    the As, but then butting the R and S up so close *without* overlapping seems like
    it's not quite resolved. Have you tried overlapping the As further? Overlapping
    the R and S?\r\n\r\nThe A combination, by the way, reminds me of American Airlines
    \u2014 even though it's not the same treatment at all. Something to think about,
    play up, or play down?"

  body: "Dear Pica Pusher,\r\nThank you for your extensive and detailed reply.\r\n\r\nI
    think you definitely touched upon some very interesting points, and have to agree
    with you. I am now on my way to create a new version with the R and S overlapping
    with the As and see how it will end up, hopefully it will end up being even more
    unified.\r\nHowever, I think I will opt for the non italic version of the font
    for the \"international\" text as I just tried to print it at small size and it
    seems to be more readable compared to the more contrasty italic version.\r\n\r\nI
    will keep you updated with some new concepts soon.\r\n"

    what a lot of people <a href="http://www.aa.org">associate AA  with</a>.
