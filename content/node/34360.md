  under the impression that 'ccmp' is better suited for precomposed glyphs that have
  their own Unicode slots and 'mark' better for things like composing things like
  accented IPA glyphs or other accented characters that do not have unique Unicode
  points. Is this a fair assumption, or is there more i need to take into consideration?"

  body: "I have a feeling that the \"right\" answer is deep in the software issue.
    \ From the OT features registry under ccmp:\r\n\r\n<cite>. . . The feature should
    be processed as the first feature processed . . . This allows the font vendor
    to do special handling of the mark combination when doing further processing without
    requiring larger contextual rules.</cite>\r\n\r\nOther issues might be what software
    supports `mark' vs `ccmp'. I have always used ccmp for glyphs that do not have
    a precomposed Unicode slot, primarily because Adam Twardoch used that when he
    wrote a bit on how to make us these characters & the associated code for an old
    \"Fontlab tips\" article.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=3403&LastModified=4675609910422321102\r\n\r\nYou
    might even consider audience. Putting on my asbestos suit, I'd say   there is
    a certain group who will enter any character other that a-z by using the glyph
    pallet. And another group who, if the character is in Latin Extended A or B, will
    just enter the Unicode string"

  body: "There are pros and cons to both approaches.\r\n\r\nIf you use ccmp instead
    of mark positioning, then you need to include a precomposed glyph for every diacritic
    combination that you want to support. That may be a lot of glyphs, and you're
    left not supporting any combinations beyond that set. On the other hand, GSUB
    is faster to process than GPOS, so the font will be quicker, and although it is
    arduous to kern all those diacritic combinations -- especially exceptions to the
    class kerning -- it is relatively straightfoward to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you use the
    mark feature instead of the ccmp feature, you get the benefit of much greater
    flexibility, being able to support arbitrary diacritic combinations. You also
    don't have to create all those precomposed glyphs. The biggest downside to mark
    positioning, I think, is trying to integrate it with kerning. Imagine: you have
    an uppercase T followed by an i with a dynamically positioned combining mark above;
    you have to specify the kerning contextually, with the combining mark(s) as context.
    Or a more complicated situation: you have two narrow letters, both of which have
    dynamically positioned combining marks above and the marks are wide enough to
    clash; you have to contextually increase the spacing of one of the letters in
    context of the other letter + the marks. I've done this for Arabic and Thai, and
    am in the process of doing it for Biblical Hebrew, and it's not fun. [In fact,
    there's probably only one aspect of OTL development that is less fun. I'll see
    if you can guess what it is.]\r\n\r\nOf course, you can employ a combination of
    ccmp and mark features. This gets you the pros and cons of both, but with some
    added work: you need to include mark positioning not only for the base glyphs
    but also for all the precomposed diacritics in the ccmp lookups, since the mark
    feature should support arbitrary sequences including those diacritics."

    can program contextual kerning in VOLT. I'm not sure whether you can do so in
    FL/FDK; I suspect the syntax supports it, but I don't know whether it will compile.\r\n\r\nI
    have not tested contextual kerning for the Latin script in ID CS3, but that would
    be the most likely place it would work. I've use contextual kerning extensively
    in Arabic fonts, and this works in MS Office, OpenOffice, ID ME, etc."

    transcription by run-of-the-mill Linguistics students.  This means that all the

    of varying widths with diacrtics?  Descenders are also always an issue.\r\n\r\nI
    heard that Open Office is supposed to be supporting more font features with its
    next release sometime Fall of 09.  Anyone know if it will support base to mark
    features?   "
