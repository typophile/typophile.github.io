  body: Good ol&#39; Slick Slimbach didn&#39;t touch that face.  <BR>As for Amplitude,
    I don&#39;t think it has an italic &#40;yet&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regarding Dauphin,
    that&#39;s the equivalent for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/DELQ/F_DELQ-10005000.jhtml"
    target="_blank"> Delphin</a>  <BR>I presume? It comes very close, but notice that
