  body: "I think you're right Lex. The only place where the 'breaks' are inconsistent
    with Glaser seems to be the W. Other than that, which could be easily 'fixed',
    I can see this being done by outlining in white to thin the strokes. (I haven't
    tried it, but I can imagine it would be similar). I also looked at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/jigsaw/\">Jigsaw</a>,
    but peaks of the A & W are not the same, and neither is the structure of the R,
    even though the light weight is pretty similar overall.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think the shapes of the Futura letters are a bit different (especially
    the R) even though the peaks are pointed.\r\n\r\nI tried the Glaser Stencil idea,
    and the problem is that when you make the white border big enough, the gaps between
    pieces become too big. I also see the leg of the R has the wrong angle and the
    W is too wide.\r\n\r\nI'd guess a customized sans using the Glaser (almost) stencil
    breaks as a model.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "There is a Futura Stencil Light in Phil's Homage to the Alphabet (p.169)
    that is almost that one, the \"W\" is the only one that seems different and the
    \"Y\" is just backwards.\r\n\r\nI've found a Futura Light Stencil on line from
    <a href=\"http://www.modularmedia.com/details.php?id=269\">Modular Graphics &
    Media</a>, but it is more based in Futura than in Glaser Stencil.\r\n"

  body: "Nice catch Ignacio. That one in the Phil's Photo book is much closer than
    the other one you found, which does look just like a stencilized Futura. The W
    in the sample might have been made from two squooshed V's (with a gap added for
    the overlap), or just drawn from scratch to be a narrower letter than the actual
    W in the typeface. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
