  digital file for a new edition, when the publisher no longer has (or never had)
  a computer file of it. OCR errors are inevitable, some of them quite hilarious.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a name for OCR errors, especially the unintentionally humorous ones? I submit
  that they be called Checkered Hags. Here's the story: In a book about Indy car racing
  that I was OCRing, my OCR program had trouble with the f-l ligature. Instead of
  f-l, it responded with uppercase H. And of course the numerous checkered flags encountered
  in a book about auto racing became checkered Hags. (I had to check all H's in the
  OCRed text when I noticed this.)\r\n\r\nGary\r\n\r\n"

    were still really floppy (and could be stapled to a printout), they were prone
    to having bad sectors. Rather than asking authors a new disk for a single bad
    sector, I usually just typed those missing 512 bytes from the manuscript. Then,
    being apprehensive at my typing skills, I would spell-check it. And sure enough,
    then a customer complained about his text describing lots of \"pubic areas\"."
