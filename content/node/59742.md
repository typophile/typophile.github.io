  body: "I doubt that many people will really be interested in this, but since you
    asked:\r\n\r\nPaul Stiff, \u2018Instructing the printer: what specification tells
    about typographic designing\u2019, Typography papers 1, 1996, pp. 27\u201374 \r\n\r\nThis
    article deals with the communication between the designer/typographer (the one
    who decides what a typographic setting is to look like) and the typesetter (the
    one who makes the design \"real\"). These relationships are rapidly disappearing
    in much of the world of typography. But they still exist, especially in book work,
    my realm.\r\n\r\nI've been in both situations, in the metal and digital worlds.
    I found this article very nicely expressed what I have experienced, and (even
    better) helped me think about my current role as a design & production manager
    and typographer. Highly recommended.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n"
