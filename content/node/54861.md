  feeling \u2014 maybe a semi proportional typewriter \u2014 for a book? In the best
  case: a monospaced and a proportional version of the same typeface, both with the
  mono \"look\".\r\n\r\nF"

    years at the soonest.\r\n\r\nBTW what is the motivation for the mono or semi-mono?"

  body: "I did see the other thread, just wanted to avoid hijacking it. I'm thinking
    of doing ascii artwork to illustrate the text and match them, hopefully using
    the same typeface.I'm hoping to find something along the lines of those multi-width
    typewriters, maybe three or four widths.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should look for a monospace
    typewriter and do some custom editing of wide and narrow glyphs. I want it to
    be read, but still keep the mono feel somehow.\r\n\r\nI'm not too keen on neither
    Letter Gothic nor The Sans. Magda is way too techy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Looks nice! You image has a soft feeling and a little bit of a euro feeling
    as well I think.

  body: Thanks Eben. Do you think something along those lines (in terms of character
    widths) could work in a book? Obviously not optimally.
