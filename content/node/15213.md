    enough to understand this. The whole \"obey giant\" and \"hranr\" thing I can
    get, but this? What does \"Shram\" mean? And is Hrant's last name intentionally
    mispelled so that the word \"paparazi\" is inside of it? Do these two equal an
    insult? If it is an insult, shouldn't we get it?"

    vaguely remember a post on one of the forums which referred to Hrant as \"Paparazzi\"
    and was quite negative about him.\r\n\r\nI'm as puzzled as Dan. "

    a writer and a creative director. Not only the same name but in the same business.

    as a memento -even anonymously- are slim... Speaking of anonymity, why is the
    AtypI story so?\r\n\r\nBTW, the mock shirt could have been done by another party,
    as a reaction. \"Shram\" is indeed strange; the classic \"Rant\" would have been
    better. Being called Paparazzi though is quite common - it's the first thing some
    people (especially those not sufficiently exposed to foreign names) think of;
    my sister used to be called that all the time by a male coworker - but in that
    case it was a term of endearment. Didn't work though.\r\n\r\n> Is there a possibility

  body: "Whether it's meant as a mock or a loving gesture is maybe irrelevant. The
    point is Hrant is an institution. I think it's genius. Knowing that Hrant is capable
    looking at it and still being unflappable makes me smile. Hrant has proven that
    he's capable of being as outspoken as he is and also capable of rolling with the
    jokes that come with that outspoken territory.\r\n\r\nThe Hrant/Jakob Nielsen
    comparison is right on -- though I've never met Nielsen. Jakob Nielsen is in the
    same boat. Some love him, others love to hate him and he can be the butt of some
    jokes. But Nielsen has been there, like the bit of irritating sand that makes
    a pearl possible. Nielsen's set himself up as an expert in that he has strong
    opinions on everything and he backs it up. You look at Nielsen's work and it can
    be pretty ugly and gets designers and other UI professionals in a tizzy (me included
    at times), but you cannot question the fact that his presence on the scene has
    elevated the discussion and kept the debate on the table in good and productive
    ways. \r\n"
