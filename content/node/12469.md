  (neither of them typographic or even particularly visual people) on the idea of
  spending thousands of dollars for a typographic update. I'd love to have in my back
  pocket a few examples of typographic redesigns (before and after shots) that really
  show the idea of small changes making a big difference. I seem to remember seeing
  someone's site who redesigned a lot of newspaper mastheads... \r\n\r\nSo please
  throw me some urls. Titling fonts rather than text is more appropriate, brands rather
  than magazines/newspapers are more appropriate. Subtle changes are best, but the
  'wow' factor of the After pic being way nicer than the Before, even to untrained
  eyes, is key.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-obsolete"
