body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nright now i'm working on a programm that does some manual typesetting
  on a pretty low level, i.e. it handles fonts as vector shapes and places them manually
  with no help from the OS. The feature i'm trying to get right at this moment is
  kerning, and while it seems to work most of the time, there are some artifacts with
  Cambria:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cambria kerning_5527.png]\r\n\r\nFor
  example, he 'd' and the 'e' are too close, and 'tt' or 'ty' overlap. So i've taken
  a look into its kerning pairs table and found more than one entry for 'de', the
  first one being -6 (at a font size of 40), which is the one used simply because
  it's found first. Later on there are some entries with -3 and a couple more with
  -6, 6 entries total. Typically, i'd expect one kerning value per pair of characters.
  Is the fact that Cambria has more of them some kind of a glitch in the font, or,
  if not, which one should i choose? Any help would be greatly appreciated."
