body: "I'm currently designing a logo for a solar car racing team. The mark is pretty
  much solidified at this point, but I'm looking for type to complement it. Attached
  is the b/w version (since the colours aren't finalized yet).\r\n\r\nI suggested
  Proxima Nova for the type, but the client said it was \"too blocky\". Their old
  logo used Eras Bold, and they want something \"like that\". So the requirements
  are:\r\n\r\n-Italic\r\n-Shapes that complement the sun's rays from the image\r\n-Not
  \"too blocky\"\r\n-Budget-conscious\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch in advance,\r\n\r\n -

  my ideas :P<cite>"

  body: "Thanks, Stephen. I'm really happy with how the mark turned out.\r\n\r\nThese
    are some good suggestions. I like Cocon, but its letterforms are a bit too...
    techno, if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nAlso (I should have mentioned this) the client
    really likes my logo for <a href=\"http://apartment32.com/portfolio/portfolio03.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Moncur Groundwater</a> because it looks \"clean\" and \"fresh\".
    So, I'm guessing they want something in a humanist face, and not too dark.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help, and keep the suggestions coming.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    client saying that they've decided it's too late to change the logo for this year,
    so I'm going to have to put this one on the back burner (or even off the stove
    and into the freezer) for a while.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Jackie - the name of the team isn't \"Solar Racing\", they are a solar car racing
    team for a university. I can't divulge more at this time."

    follow many races - but I'm in the Southeast. I was able to dig up that Solar
    racing is in California, New Mexico and Arizona -- I was surprised I hadn't heard
    about it. (I'm supposedly an editor for a car magazine -- but we deal mostly in
    historic issues...)\r\n\r\nWell, I'll patiently wait for you to fill in the blanks
    -- one day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I wanted you to know it was a nice looking logo
    - can't wait to see the finished piece... again, one day."
