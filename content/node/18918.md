  Disney lettering has noticed that now <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mrg/sets/49427/">Disney

  body: "I think this shows that for many graphic designers working on projects for
    corporate clients (and maybe even some in-house designers) its far easier and
    quicker to use internet search engines to locate corporate font styles than it
    is to extract them from the client, or find them on the companies intranet or
    extranet. \r\n\r\nThis is especially true for what in England are known as \"Mickey
    Mouse Fonts\" ;-)\r\n"

  body: "I've done font work for Disney in the past (mostly cleaning up and compiling
    glyphs done by their artists) and from the sorts of things that I learned their
    lawyers tell them it's not surprising they're so cavalier about NOT SPENDING ANY
    MONEY on truly original type designs. Shame.\r\n\r\n> unicase x-height that allows
    stacking text\r\n\r\nYeah. Can't do that with caps.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Disney called Microsoft one day and asked to license Comic Sans. So Disney
    licensed one of my fonts too. For payment I got a signed picture from Mickey Mouse
    in return. I showed it in a slide show at St. Bride's a few years ago.

    they found out it would possibly be budgeted using money from the legal fund."
