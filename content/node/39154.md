body: A couple of my colleagues and I are searching for a FontLab mini course. There
  seems to be nothing available at this time. Does anyone know if there is one? Location
  wise we are open to anywhere in the US, but we would love it if it was in either
  Los Angeles or San Franciso!

    with inconsistentcies, bugs and \"what the hell was that!\", it takes more than
    a day just to explain what not to do. Good luck!\r\n\r\nCheers!"
