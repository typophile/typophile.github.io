  body: It would help to have a few more upper case letters, like a G and M, if possible.
    Or a better closeup of the word &#39;forgiveness&#39;. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Hm, I&#39;m thinking &#34;Men&#39;s Health&#34; here.. Some variant of Century
    Condensed maybe? I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about, Mr. Simonson should
    turn up any minute <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Hmm. This is tougher than it looks. At first I was thinking something like
    Utopia or Walbaum, but no. It does have a very Century look to it, but the R would
    be totally out of place in a Century face. It&#39;s more of a Baskerville R.

  body: I don&#39;t have any bigger screenshots, as it&#39;s from a 320x240 trailer.
    <BR>Here&#39;s a few more -- the ones with the &#34;Sky&#34; background might
    be different, it could be that the other screenshots&#39; font is a compressed
    version of the &#34;In 2004...&#34; font. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25663.jpg"

  body: It kind of shares a similarity with &#34;Latin MT&#34;, too, if you expand
    it a bit. <BR> <BR>&#62;Ok, scratch that, I have no idea what I&#39;m talking
    about, heh. These kinds of fonts are something I know nothing about.

  body: No, it&#39;s not a match, but very similar. There&#39;s something maddenly
    familiar about the sample, though. My guess is it will turn out to be something
    very common. I just can&#39;t place it.
