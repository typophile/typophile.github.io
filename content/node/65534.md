  across a bird I've made to a friend of mine. It's fleur de lis turned into a bird;
  a cardinal. I wanted to use that as a fleuron, so I copied it to FontLab, and started
  buggering about. Soon it started to have very Caslon-like look, so I went with that.\r\n\r\nHere
  is what I have this far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cardinale_5512.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's a pdf.\r\n\r\nLower case 'g is a bit dark, but otherwise it's not too bad
  in my opinion."

    almost falling sidewides...  I like that. wild!\r\n\r\nhowever if you ask me (but
    you won't) then I think the \"<strong> r </strong>\" is a little to fat/bold up
    to the right.\r\n\r\nhow about making it a little slimmer like the  top left of
    the \"<strong> a </strong>\""

  body: Thanks, I like the form of 'g' as well, it's just a bit dark at he bottom
    loop. That's an easy fix. And 'r is a bit unwieldly. I'll fix that one as well.

  body: I like the face, although it doesn't remind me too much of Caslon. The lower
    case is closer to Garamond... and the upper case isn't even old style!

    Style (even though it is a bit of an odd man out with the rest). Here is full
    upper- and lower case.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cardinale2_5118.png]"

    nice typeface, too"

    not finished yet, same with many other characters. I've posted italics as well.
    What do you think of those?"

  body: "Hi, Stefan-\r\n\r\nItalics are under way. You can see them in this same Serif
    critique, under 'Cardinale'.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, that Fourier: I was commissioned
    to make a bold version of the typeface, and I made that. While doing that I noticed
    the state of MT Fournier; it was horrendous! Points were all over the place, and
    beziers pointing everywhere. I started thinking about making a revival of Fournier
    then.\r\n\r\nBut then I went to my library, and found a facsimile of <em>Fournier's
    Mod\xE9les des Characteres de l'Imprimerie</em>. It's a copy number 320 of 600
    from the Printing Library of the Saint Bride Institute from 1965 with an introduction
    by James Mosley.\r\n\r\nThere is no bold variant there. It is a single font with
    sizes from larger than Gros Canon to Nonparelle with italics and small capitals
    and some special cuts and a huge amount of ornaments and borders.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    seems to be the only seller of Monotype original. This should be an interesting
    project with pretty steep learning curve.\r\n\r\nThis will take a while, though

  body: "Hi Tomi,\r\n\r\nsure is, that Fournier is one of the most beautiful typefaces
    all over the history of printing. Not casualy early Bodoni works were (successfully)
    inspired by it.\r\nItalic is particularly charming and unbeaten in my eyes.\r\nAnd
    Monotype versions in the past have been weak, indeed.\r\nI also found beautiful
    specimen of Fournier type in the university library at Hamburg, Germany,\r\nthough
    I believe that were reprinted ones.\r\nGo on with Fournier!\r\nYou should also
    look for Fournier interpretations on this site. I belive Raph Levian did one,
    but I am not quite sure about. But if he did it will sure be worth looking for
    it.\r\n\r\nSalute\r\nStefan"

    can do about it. It will take time.

  body: "Whoah! Sorry I missed this one! Great stuff, Tomi :)\r\nOnly a few little
    comments for the mo. Hopefully I'll call back later ithis week.\r\nD looks a bit
    light on the right, and perhaps a bit too oval. I think O, o and Q could be somewhat
    darker on the heavies.\r\nR is quite skinny, especially in the middle.\r\nb looks
    a bit unresolved on its bottom spur. I'm afraid it'll look blobby in small settings.\r\nI'd
    make the foot serifs on p and q longer I think. And probably r as well. r could
    be wider?\r\nJoin of u looks high.\r\ny looks a bit sloped.\r\nThink the corners
    on z should be slightly rounded.\r\nThe uppercase looks a bit light compared to
    the lowercase and I suspect the serifs would look nice a few units thicker as
    well as perhaps the hairlines.\r\nI like the fleuron. \r\nI know you're a fan
    of flipped quote marks but do you think they fit this font?\r\n\r\nIs this quite
    a display sort of font? "

    many good points. I'll go through your points, an probably keep flipped quotes.
    But let see what happens. Happy to get your comments."
