    approach to brand standards. Something I have been wondering lately is if using
    the same identity forever just leads people to take it for granted and not notice
    it. For example, I can't even remember the last time I saw any promotions for
    American Airlines because the brand standards have been the same for almost fifty
    years. Everything AA does just blends into my environment. I don't see the Coke
    logo much, either. Logos and type standards may have worked well in the twentieth
    century but I think we are moving into a world where brand standards are less
    important than meaningful customer interaction.\r\n\r\nThat said, a halfassed
    grannies-with-guitars gimmick is not even close to meaningful customer interaction!"

    a different argument. Sure, perfectly good designs wear out.\r\nI'm not advocating
    never updating, merely adhering to whatever the brand identity is at any given
    point in time.\r\nAlso, some brands may incorporate a multiplicity of type styles,
    if the varied styles are associated with distinctly branded products. But that
    isn't the case with Network Solutions, because they are not presenting the non-granny
    product, whatever it is, as such.\r\n\r\nBlack Knight is \"my\" brand, so I have
    their racquets and bag. But I'm kind of confused at the moment, as they are mixing
    a techno look with their longstanding Cooper Black Italic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/002_6487.BKRSRBTRNY-1.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/140_3955.jpg]"

  body: The ad on top says to me, "here's a cute,  made up band of clones . . . we're
    not like that." I think it suggests that clones are unreliable. They may be on
    to something. If the clones had a genetic defect which might affect performance,
    the entire band could be out-of-commission on that momentous day (yourwedding)
    rather than just one band member.

    least Telus has remained true to their legacy high quality television advertisements.
    \ It's a shame that their paper and internet advertisements have slowly deteriorating.\r\n\r\n@Nick

    </em>\r\n\r\nI could be taking this completely out of its proper context, but
    are you implying that it is far better when companies bash other companies in
    advertisements?  If not, disregard this next part.\r\nI am just curious if that
    is the manner you meant it in because I always found when companies do that, it
    makes their advertisements weaker.  My choice example is Pepsi, most of their
    commercials are them bashing Coke and frankly it's quite unprofessional and ineffective
    when they do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
