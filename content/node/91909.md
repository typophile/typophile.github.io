body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nSomewhere on Typophile I read about adding dots (nuqta) to base
  glyph in VOLT.\r\nThis means instead of making glyphs for each combination of base
  glyph with dots in FontLab, you use VOLT to compose glyphs on the fly using a single
  base glyph.\r\n\r\nThis has something to do with CCMP feature.\r\n\r\nI request
  anyone who has used this feature for the mentioned purpose to kindly share their
  experience.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards."

  body: "You still need precomposed versions of the default encoded Unicode characters,
    but then you can decompose these in VOLT and use GPOS mark positioning for the
    dots. This can be done either in the ccmp feature, or within the individual shaping
    features: isol, init, medi and fina. So, for example, one can decompose\r\n\r\n<code>ccmp\r\nuni0628
    -> B.isol dotbelow</code>\r\n\r\nThere are some software support issues with this
    approach -- if a user in Word turns off display of marks, or chooses to display
    the marks in a different colour, this will incorrectly affect the dots -- but
    it is the most practical approach for many traditional styles of Arabic in which
    dot position needs to be contextually adjusted."

    body: "Thanks John for the reply.\r\n\r\nWhat if I only make the default encoded
      Unicode characters in Fontlab with nuqtas added to them, and dont do anything
      (ccmp or any type of decomposition) to these glyphs in VOLT, and compose rest
      of glyphs and nuqtas in VOLT..\r\n\r\nIs that a possible workflow?\r\n\r\nThanks
      and regards."

  body: "Short answer is no it's not gonna work!\r\nwhy? because glyph will not be
    decomposed to the base character and Noqta, so I guess when you start typing using
    this approach, you will not see any Nuqta in the program."

  body: "Thanks bahman for the reply.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion this far, I think
    the workflow goes something like this:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Create all default encoded
    Unicode characters in Fontlab with nuqtas added to them.</li>\r\n<li>Decompose
    them in VOLT using CCMP feature.</li>\r\n<li>Add nuqtas to them again in VOLT
    using GPOS mark positioning.</li>\r\n<li>For all the other glyphs, only create
    a base glyph in FontLab, and add nuqtas in VOLT using CCMP feature.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPlease
    correct me if I'm making any mistake in the above list.\r\n\r\nAnother question:
    I'll use mark positioning to add Nuqtas. Then again I'll use Mark positioning
    to add Diacritics. Wouldn't that be a problem?\r\n\r\nThanks and regards."

    use different named anchors for dots and for vowel marks (you may end up with
    more than one anchor for different numbers of dots, too). The other thing you
    need to cater for in this method is positioning of vowel signs relative to dots
    <em>when preceded by some letters but not by others.</em> In other words, sometimes
    you will want mark-to-mark positioning for the vowel signs and sometimes mark-to-base.
    And that is contextual.\r\n\r\nThere's no denying that this approach introduces
    a lot of complexities, and I only recommend it for styles in which you need to
    be able to move the dots around."

    system - like Windows - will deal with the Noqta as if it were a diacritic mark,
    if requested by coloring composition it will color Noqta with it.\r\n\r\nNote
    2: You should test positions of Noqta to the letters and to diacritics with any
    GPOS you do, Noqta will be affected by it.\r\n\r\nNote 3: You will make a lot
    of GPOS tables - like John hinted - and it will be so complexity, so trying.\r\n\r\nWe
    can benefit the experience of our friend Khaled Hosny, He has developed his font
    - Amiri -  by this way and he faced some problems.  \r\n\r\n\r\nbest wishes \r\nBadr"

  body: "Thanks John and Badr for the valuable guidance.\r\n\r\nThe font I'm working
    on for about 3 years is based on a reasonably complex naskh script. \r\nMovable
    nuqtas is on of the top 3 requirements of the design. (to avoid collision of nuqtas
    in words like  \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064A\u064A\u0646\u060C \u062A\u062A\u0642\u0648\u0646\u060C
    \u062A\u0642\u062A\u062A\u0644\u060C \u062A\u0642\u0648\u0644), currently I've
    made seperate glyphs for some common collisions and used CALT on them. The current
    approach is not at all working, as it only covers specific collisions. This led
    me to find some other solution.\r\n\r\nI found these very useful guide on Khtt.net.\r\n[[http://khtt.net/attachment/31760|Part
    1]]\r\n[[http://khtt.net/attachment/33164|Part 2]]\r\n\r\nAmirifont.org is also
    very useful reference.\r\nKhaled Hosny talking about THE PROBLEM : [[http://www.khaledhosny.org/node/178|Khaled's
