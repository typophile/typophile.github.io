  body: Its for commercial use. And yes I am starting with the outlines of Bodoni
    Poster Italic. I cant remember which foundry I got it from, so I dont know where
    to find the EULA. Is that usually packaged with the font? or is it something on
    their website?

  body: "Hang on,\r\n\r\nRandall, do you mean that you want to modify the outlines
    of some of the letters in Bodoni only for a one-off design project? Or are you
    making new functioning font software? I feel like people here are assuming you
    want to modify the font to make a new font and their answers are based on that.
    Which is it? \r\n\r\nI have been assuming it's OK to change the shape of the letterforms
    when you're designing something, I think that's different from changing the font
    software itself. Please correct me if I'm wrong\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: Most foundries allow you to modify the shapes of letters, for a logo let's
    say. But, if you want to modify the outlines and create a new font many foundries
    do not allow this. Further still you will not find any foundries that allow for
    derivatives to be sold.

    are true in most western countries, including the USA.\r\n\r\nHowever, most font
    licenses permit modifications after converting to outlines, like for a logo. A
    few, such as Adobe's, allow you to modify the original font, as long as it's for
    your internal use and you're not redistributing it. (Note: check the license itself
    for details.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

    Bodoni Poster is out of any copyright period). '

    are some pretty kooky EULAs out there.\r\n\r\nYip, and I've got one of them. It's
    pretty rare, but Ross Mills and I decided to restrict the use of my new font,
    <a href=\"http://www.bantjes.com/index.php?id=174\" target=\"_blank\">Restraint</a>,
    in that for the basic licensing you can't use it as a major or sole element for
    logos, major ad campaigns or items for sale ... altered or unaltered. I was really
    torn about this, because as a designer I recognize how jarring that seems, but
    ultimately he convinced me. P22 also has similar restrictions on some (all?) of
    their fonts.\r\n\r\nHowever, to make things more confusing, with Restraint, the
    issue is surrounding its use, so if it _wasn't_ an identity, then we would have
    no problem with someone modifying it in e.g. Illustrator for a poster or invitation
    or whatever.\r\n\r\n-marian"
