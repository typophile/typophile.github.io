  after the founding of the paper. The 52 page commemorative section \"Rocky Mountain
  News History\" is available online, containing many interesting things related to

    the pictorial!

  body: I find it also interesting that Minion was chosen for the goodbye editorial
    on the front page, instead of its usual typeface for the running text, SunText
    (which I can't find anything about). I can't imagine any plausible reason for
    this -- especially because Minion is a fairly new typeface and couldn't possibly
    be, for instance, what was used when the paper started.

  body: I was wondering about the Minion, too, since they have such nice typography
    after working with Roger Black. Perhaps they thought their normal type was too
    newsy and wanted something more elegant?

  body: 'Re. Minion: it was used to contrast with the style of the first edition,
    so that the Then and Now elements of the final front page are in distinction.
    The designer chose to oppose the Modernity of classic news types with an older,
    humanist form.'

  body: "@Nick: Now I'm even more confused than before. Are you saying that not only
    does the two decade old Minion appear stylistically \"older\" than the newspaper
    typeface one and a half century ago, but it is actually the designer's intention
    to show this \"contrast\"? As in \"old is new, new is old\"?\r\n\r\nYou don't
    think the typical newspaper typeface today -- like Rocky's SunText -- is different
    enough from the typeface used for the First Edition? And even that'd be the case,
    I'd have thought that the overall negative impact of using a typeface that people
    can't identify with the newspaper for its Final Edition outweighs any particular
    gain from the purely aesthetic perspective."

    As in \u201Cold is new, new is old\u201D?</em>\r\n\r\nThat's incidental. As I
    see it, the designer wanted to give the farewell message an otherness that visually
    separated it from the reproduction of the first issue that is part of the same
    page. Such overt contrast is the graphic concept of the page. One way to do it
    was to use a non-newspaper face, such as the humanist Minion.\r\n"

  body: Actually, I'm doubtful you can call Minion a "non-newspaper face". Are humanist
    typefaces generally considered "non-newspaper"? If so, I don't understand why.
    One of Minion's most outstanding properties is its (visually discrete) narrowness,
    which makes it a great choice for anything where space matters. One could argue
    that nowhere does space matter more than in newspapers.

  body: "Minion is absolutely not a news face. For display it's too mannered, while
    for text its vertical proportions are way off.\r\n\r\nAlso, concerning narrowness,
    it's actually not necessarily space-saving, especially in a newspaper. The most
    sense I've managed to make on this is here, about 2/3-rds of the way down: http://daidala.com/25apr2004.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I'm just reporting the facts.\r\nHumanist faces such as Minion are rarely used
    for newspapers.\r\nOf Robert Slimbach's faces, Utopia has founf favour for news
    text."
