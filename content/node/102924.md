  be if one wanted to design a typeface that was inspired by a logotype of a company,
  organization, or sports team? If the logotypes were designed somewhere in the 1940s
  or 1950s and still in use today. And particular letters of the font would attempt
  to match exactly the letters in the logotype. This font could be used as an accompanying
  character set to the letters already in the logotype.\r\n\r\nThanks for any info!"
