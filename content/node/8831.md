body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for similar typefaces often used during Russian
  Constructivism period , especially on the propaganda posters....angular, same thickness
  strokes, condensed, with square &#34;O&#34;, no roundess in &#34;B&#34;&amp;&#34;C&#34;,
  etc.? Any suggestions ? Thanks very much, <BR> <BR> <BR>dlogic

  body: Thanks Karl,  <BR> <BR>I came across this before. Can anyone recommend anything
    more condensed ? Also, I don&#39;t need Russian characters, only font with the
    same characteristic and nicely &#34;balanced&#34; so to speak. Thanks, <BR> <BR>dlogic

  body: I have a font called Odeon Condensed that is from Hoefler but I can&#39;t
    find it anywhere on the web. I seem to remember this coming up before in this
    forum but can&#39;t find the thread. I guess this is kind of a useless post, but
    it&#39;s a great condensed squarish font and I used it for a film on the Internationale.
    I reversed the Rs of coursed.

  body: As I recall, Odeon was based on the old ATF face Raleigh. FontHaus has a version
    of it <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=FH10896" target="_blank">here</a>.

    is similar, and has a lot of weights. It was &#40;if I can remember properly,
    and I usually can&#41; used for the main titles in the remake of The Manchurian
    Candidate. <BR> <BR> - Lex'
