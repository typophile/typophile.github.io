  of the second, but the first just looks more 'natural' to me, like it's saying:
  'We're classic, we're good.' Any thoughts are appreciated :-)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJasper\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vaxinepict_4119.png]"

  body: "I think the problem is visual consistency. If you are going to do the x thick
    stroke serifs, inside that way, the other serifs would need more of a relationship
    to that. So the \r\nserifs on the thin stroke of the x, the i and n would need
    some relationship..."

  body: I agree with you the first is more natural. I can't really see a reason for
    the second option, whilst the first looks more balanced and less attention-grabbing.
    The other letters have normal serif patterns.

  body: I wonder if (in the top one) the gap between the inside serifs at the top
    of the /x/ is too close.

  body: 'Suggestion: make two different typefaces or two different weights with this.
    If you manage to derive an alphabet from the aesthetics of the second, you could
    use it as something in between regular and italic. See as well this thread: http://typophile.com/node/64298'
