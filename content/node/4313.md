  body: Thanks, Tom. All good comments. I&#39;m intending on including at least the
    2 &#34;leaf&#34; dingbats.  <BR> <BR>Glad to hear you like the original 5 I&#39;ve
    been waffling on it &#40;obviously&#41;. What do you &#40;or anyone else&#41;
    think about the lc &#39;b&#39;? I&#39;m not totally sold on it. If I get time
    this afternoon I&#39;ll post the variants.

  body: Can I pick in between the two? I like the tail on the lower case l. Because
    the bowl of the b extends so far out, why not end the terminal shorter?  <BR>
    <BR>I prefer the first &#34;m&#34;. Although I see why you might be struggling
    with it. <BR> <BR>Also, is the spine of the &#34;s&#34; optically centered? It
    looks low right now.

  body: I prefer the first &#34;m&#34; letter. But &#34;b&#34; bowl too extend. And
    it is not necessary to bend stam of &#34;b&#34; I think...

    with a face that i work with <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>. About this saga: <BR> <BR>The first is very teoretical,
    but doesen&#39;t work well, looks very big compared to &#34;a&#34;.  <BR>The second
    is something close to the natural way of writing the character by hand, not so
    high as &#34;o&#34;, and not so low as &#34;a&#34;.  <BR>The third is the other
    extreme, you should try to see how it looks hext to &#34;o&#34;, &#34;b&#34;,

    the last &#34;m&#34;, balance the position of the middle stem. <BR> <BR>Gorjan'

  body: Nice work, Ken! <BR> <BR>I like the <b>b</b> in the first line better than
    the other two variants. It is a flipped <b>d</b> &#40;right?&#41;, which makes
    it work better with the rest of the lowercase &#40;except, as Gorjan points out,
    with <b>a</b>... have you tried any single-story variations of <b>a</b>? <BR>
    <BR>As for the alternate <b>m</b>, I&#39;m not sure it would work next to all
    of the lowercase characters, only a few of them. Place an <b>o</b> or a <b>u</b>
    right after it and you&#39;ll see what I mean. <BR> <BR>Keep it up! <BR>

    of the @ but didn&#39;t think too highly of it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks to all who have
    contributed so far I&#39;m working on a number of your suggestions and hope to
    post some other letter variants for discussion soon &#40;damn full time gig keeps

  body: i prefer the top b and m, I think it just makes the face more usable. Maybe
    the second b down could be in the font as an alternative. The bottom one just
    seems wrong. <BR> <BR>You may also want to try doing this, round the bottom of
    the letters, or it may be worth trying? <BR> <BR>===<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36564.gif"

  body: The digbat is really really sweet. I would be very tempted by the font if
    it came with some more cool dingbats.  I love your numbers! I hope you realease
    this one!  <BR> <BR>Now my crit!  <BR> <BR>I like the top b best - what if the
    m was rounded like an arch with a support collumn? Maybe the feet could curl in
    a tiny bit like the bottom of the &#39;e&#39;. What about pulling the bottom right
    leg of the k further to the right &amp; giving it more kerned space? I think the
    &#39;i&#39; &amp; &#39;l&#39; need a little more space too. <BR> <BR>Looking at
    the original PDF I wonder about swithching the M &amp; m shapes. The cap uses
    the form I just imagined. The 4 seeps too wide. The cap Y could use some extra
    width - it looks cramped.
