<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi!
I've eventually decided to join in after a while sitting on the sidelines!
Thought I'd pose a question: I'm currently designing an identity for a client; in terms of presenting work/amounts of work, I'm of the school of thought that says present 3 solutions that you're happy with. Sure, you're going to have your own favourite from those you show the client, but you wouldn't be gutted if they went with any particular one of them. I'd rather do that than show the 5 or 6 that my boss wants me to produce, because inevitably you get into the 'I'm not 100% happy with that logo, but we'll show it' territory and sod's law says that that's the one the client will pick!
What does everyone think? Does anyone have a routine/system that works for them? Is showing lots of identities only going to overwhelm the client?
Cheers

<div class=commentbody>Totally agree, three well-thought designs are better than six, if you apply each of those three to various situations like publication covers, web masthead, embossed, stationery, exhibition &c &c, then your presentation is more effective and you can speak with authority on each design. Despite all that Sod's Law dictates that your client will change the brief or you will drop your presentation into a puddle outside their office.

<div class=commentbody>Does your boss want you to produce 5-6, so (s)he can pick 3 to show to the client? Who is presenting to the client?
I gave a talk to a bunch of PR people last week, and there were many questions about client-designer relations, and I had only one (non-)answer: it's all about communication, and communication varies according to the indivituals involved. If it's an old client you know well and who trusts you, you can probably produce 1 or 2 roughs and get away w/ it. If it's a brand new client you want to impress, give them 4 or 5 to prove your versatility, & define wants & needs. If it's the classic "I don't know what I want, but that's not it" client ... I feel your pain.
But you are right, never present a design you're not happy with. Like a cat who somehow knows which person in the room is alergic to cats, the client can instinctively sense which design is the ugliest & most difficult to work with.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Guys!
Tim - I laughed out loud at your take on Sod's Law... I'm going to be neurotically avoiding puddles from now on!
Jay - It's my boss rather than myself who's showing to a new client... I don't know if it's a "I don't know what I want..." client - it's too early to tell - if they are, my boss hasn't said anything to me so far!
Thanks for the advice
Si</div>
