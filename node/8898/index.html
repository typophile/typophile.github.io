		<div class="commentbody">So, if this is the Answer, what is the Question? &#40;In other words, what&#39;s your intention for the typeface?&#41; It can be helpful to start your design with a brief, like &#34;This should be a text face in the style of Garamond, condensed approximately 5%, available for use with Monotype, Linotype, and hand setting.&#34; &#40;That&#39;s a paraphrase of the brief for Sabon.&#41; <BR> <BR>If you want to use this for ad work/short text/headings, it has promise, and with a bit of polish, it would find a niche.  <BR> <BR>If you want to use this for book work/long text, there&#39;s much more work ahead. In addition to the items Juan Pablo mentioned, the cap J also is likely to stand out. Remember that text faces tend to be conservative, and characters that &#34;pop out&#34; at the reader are not likely to lead to the typeface being used. <BR> <BR>Keep us posted on the progress!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is fun. I don&#39;t see it as a something that should be set in long books, but certainly in poetry or special editions of prose. This would be fun as something used in letterpress shops. <BR> <BR>I also like the -g- but I wonder if a few of the other glyphs could sway a little further towards the same level of quirkiness? The -j- has that too, and the -f- is working towards it. I see the -y- and -t- also have some of that stopped short feeling. However, the uppercase should probably maintain more solemnity. What other characters can you quirk?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i quite like your approach and the ideas you&#39;ve got -- but i think it isn&#39;t commited enough. go for &#34;quirkie&#34; or for text, in each case you&#39;d have to be more radical. <BR> <BR>some things that came to my eye: <BR>the top right extension of the Z looks a bit arbitrary to me. <BR>the X is very top heavy. <BR>the connection of bowl and stem of the b could perhaps be a bit lighter.   <BR> <BR>and without the intention of being offensive: the @ looks somehow elephantish!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for your coments and encouragement. <BR> <BR>&#34;if this is the Answer, what is the Question?&#34; hmm...  As this is my first font &#40;but not my first attempt&#41; it was a massive learning experience.  The Question was something along the lines of &#39;how hard can it be?&#39;.  I&#39;ve lost my innocence now.   <BR> <BR>But my intentions for the font was to create something I would want to use.  I&#39;m an artist first, and I mostly use printed type to describe mine or others art.  Catalogues, postcards that sort of thing.  So short texts, information, presented in a smart and contemporary environment. <BR> <BR>&#39;that g&#39;: my thinking was sometihng like this - traditional g; elegant but inefficient use of space &#40;cramped&#41; - modern&#42; g; inelegant but efficient.  So i came up with a sort of hybrid of the two.  I think it works for now, non-type-interested people i&#39;ve shown examples to haven&#39;t noticed it until i pointed it out.&#40;&#42; i don&#39;t know if &#39;modern&#39; is acurate historically&#41;. <BR> <BR>The lowercase j and t. This typeface thinks the hooks traditionally put on these letters are calligraphic and inefficient and are therefore to be spurned.  Plus i&#39;ve been enjoying Futura.  I know this has readability issues, and if my arm was twisted i would make a hooked t. <BR> <BR>As for the quirkiness of it.  Tiffanys coment about quirking other letters made me think.  The phrase &#39;stopped short feeling&#39; had quite a lot of resonance.  I guess it comes from the influence of sans-serifs faces and my inner modernist.  <BR>It seemed that these letters could be quirked: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64106.gif" alt=""> <BR>&#40;original in grey&#41; <BR> <BR>I dont&#39; think the k works, but i like the m, and arn&#39;t sure about the w.  I don&#39;t want to make it into a semi-serif. So maybe I should go further back on some letters.  But I want it to be a serious typeface. With useful quirks. The lack of a final serif on the new m reduces the width of a wide letter. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve adjusted the &#39;sad a&#39; and b as suggested by Juan Pablo.  Totally redrawring the bowl of the a and making the top of the bowl of the b 2 degrees steeper. I think it is an improvement. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64107.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Titus, yes that corner of the Z is a bit arbitary,  it&#39;ll probably go.  about the X do you mean the junction is too low on the glyph, or do you think the heavyness is to do with the stroke contrast?  i see what you mean about the elephantishness of the @ :-&#41; I was wanting to make it as small as possible, the large @ symbols allways seem to be out of place written in lowercase email adresses, and often too light.  I&#39;ll probably re-work it. <BR> <BR>Again thanks for your critiques - keep it coming. <BR> <BR>Ed</div>
