body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_disp_5894.png]\r\nThe FF Fontesque
  OpenType upgrade presents an interpretation of the typeface that is more sophisticated
  than the original grunge-era rendering, with the addition of finely-detailed display
  cuts, increased language support, and many OpenType features \u2014 most notably
  a pseudo-random effect.  \r\n\r\n<strong>\u201CRANDOM\u201D FEATURE:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_aabbcc_4149.png]\r\nThe
  Contextual Alternates feature of OpenType has been exploited to create a pseudo-random
  effect. There are alternate glyphs for every character (including all spaces, accented
  characters, punctuation, figures, ligatures, &c.) so that each is represented by
  two different glyphs. Most alternates are similar in structure but slightly different
  in proportion, alignment, and detail, so that the overall effect enhances the original
  premise of Fontesque\u2014the appearance of graceful, whimsical hand lettering without
  mechanical repetition.\r\n\r\nThe \"random\" effect is automatic. Here's what happens
  behind the scenes:\r\n\r\n1. Toggle\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_Kissing_6617.png]\r\n<blockquote>This
  causes every other character in text to be a \u201Ccalt\u201D glyph, so that when
  a character is doubled, the two glyphs are different (note double \u201Cs\u201D).
  It also provides two different \u201Clooks\u201D\u2014useful for optimizing the
  appearance of display settings. And of course, further refinement may be made by
  manual selection from the glyph palette.</blockquote>\r\n2. Proximity\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_Raisin_5944.png]\r\n<blockquote>When
  an alphabetic or numeric character repeats, separated by a single character, the
  second instance is programmed to be the other glyph for that character. Therefore,
  the closest that a glyph may repeat is when separated by three characters. So, with
  just two sets of glyphs and the \u201CToggle + Proximity\u201D system, repetition
  will not occur until the fifth character. This works because there are no languages
  in which an alphabetic character appears three times in succession (with the exception
  of a few German words).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>ALL CAPS:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_figs_5727.png]\r\n<blockquote>\u201CAll
  caps\u201D (case) feature includes:\r\n- monetary symbols\r\n- lining figures\r\n-
  brackets\r\n- hyphens & dashes\r\n- guillemets</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>OPTICAL
  SIZES:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_ns_5014.png]\r\n<blockquote>The
  addition of display weights emphasizes how the Fontesque OpenType makeover presents
  a more sophisticated interpretation of the typeface than the original grunge-era
  rendering, with carefully refined drawing of the glyphs. Now there are three optical
  sizes: Display, Normal, and Text.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>ORNAMENTS:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_Orn_6025.png]\r\n<blockquote>Each
  font now includes all 59 ornaments, and they have been rationalized:\r\n\t1. The
  same number of ornaments in each font.\r\n\t2. No \u201Cflipped\u201D versions of
  ornaments.\r\n\t3. Ornaments are weighted according to the font they are in.\r\n\t4.
  Light and Regular weights have \u201Copen\u201D ornaments, \LBold and Extra Bold
  weights have \u201Csolid\u201D ornaments.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>GERMAN:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_SS_4206.png]\r\n<blockquote>Cap
  Eszett in all styles.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>CYRILLIC:</strong>\r\nAs with
  the original Latin script version, the Cyrillic is assiduously sick, and (so far),
  quite unlike any other Cyrillic typeface.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_Cyr_5021.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>SUPERFAMILY!</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_Sans_5313.png]\r\nThe
  sans too has been upgraded, although not to the extent of the serifed Fontesque.\r\nFontesque
  Sans Pro features oldstyle and lining figures, ligatures, ornaments, and full European
  Latin script coverage, but no 'random' feature or Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nThe new Fontesques
  are available at FontShop in these formats:\r\n- OT\r\n- Pro\r\n- Office\r\n- Web\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=fontesque+pro&x=0&y=0"

    set of glyphs for Cyrillic, as working on the Cyrillics was quite a challenge,
    and a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm afraid that would be a waste of my time,
    financially, for various reasons. \r\nI would be more likely to do Greek.\r\nI
    haven't done Cyrillics for the Display and Text weights, either, again for financial
    reasons. I doubt I will get a return on the investment I made in doing the Cyrillics
    that I have, but I couldn't resist doing them, at least for the basic version
    of the typeface."
