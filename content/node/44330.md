  stay-at-home moms/dads who wish to continue building/working trusted work networks.
  Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/spin1_3678.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/spin2_5376.jpg]

    the dot of 'i' on the above version?"

  body: The beveled termini on the first option look a little odd to me. I like the
    rounded type on the bottom more, but there's a lot of focus on the a. Is there
    a reason for that? I would also keep the circles around the a separated like in
    the black and white version so it will hold up if someone photocopies /faxes it.
    I also think the white between the circles is nicer.

  body: "In your first version, I really want to delete the logo, and instead, make
    that e look like it's spinning somehow. I don't know exactly how, but it's just
    begging to be spun like the wheel of fortune. \r\n\r\nThe last two versions don't
    work for me. The A is far too important, IMO."

  body: Hmmm, spinning E. Might have to think about that for a bit. Wouldn't that
    make the E more important? I'll kick the idea around. Thanks EileenB.

  body: I really like the first two, and the alternating colors of the second round
    graphic.  I'm not sure about the color choice, maybe if you did the first one,
    but alternate the round graphic black and white, with the white ones being outlined
    with black, or just black and gray.  The "i" not having the dot doesn't bother
    me, I didn't even notice until mk2 mentioned it.

  body: "In #2, What about expanding the two rings so that they extend to the P and
    E, and keeping the a a different color> Where the rings meet the other letters,
    there could be a thin white gap.\r\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of arial rounded, there's
    certain spots where the letterforms have odd curves. Have you tried any others
    (i do like the choice of a rounded terminus)?"

  body: Good point Chipman223, I'm actually looking for a font that has a closed "a"
    but rounded terminals. VAG Rounded is one I'm looking at at using instead of the
    current one. I like how the 'a' is closed. I'll have to see how it looks. thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_5876.jpg]

  body: "Yeah ... as seems to be the consensus thus far, am really liking no.2 - that
    said though ... it has a \"cheaper\" feel than option 1, maybe it's the Arial
    rounded, or maybe it's the colours.\r\n\r\nthe 'a' in the circle also seems visually
    off centre/balance - which is distracting.\r\n\r\nkerning needs work particularly
    on 'dex'.\r\n\r\nlooking forward to see where this goes.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br

    lot nicer than most website logos out there, but it seems like you might want

  body: How married is your client to the name? It doesn't make any sense to me. Maybe
    you could come up with a better name. It needs to be more direct to its audience.
    I wouldn't want to work this hard to make the connection. I assume your client
    doesn't have unlimited resources to promote their site. So it should have a in
    you face name.
