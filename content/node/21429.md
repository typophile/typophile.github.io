  I've found some cool sets from youworkforthem.com. (see: http://www.youworkforthem.com/list.php?cat=73)\r\n\r\nAny
  other suggestions where I might find more like these?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I hate to be a downer, but you will need to read the EULA of any dingbat/image
    font very closely before you use it for t-shirt designs. Many foundaries do not
    allow their dingbat/image fonts to be used as a sole element in a design such
    a t-shirt of logo.

  body: "I once had a designer use a glyph, capital D, from one of my fonts, as a
    corporate logo.\r\nI was fine with that, but pointed out that the client wouldn't
    be able to copyright or trademark their own logo. The same holds true for ornaments/dinbats,
    I would imagine."
