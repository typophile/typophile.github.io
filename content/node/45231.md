  a typeface based on a specific area. I have chosen the area, it is a landmark that
  deals with two cultures and the reclaiming of land. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of pulling
  the semiotics out of the area and visually working these into letter forms giving
  a more meaningful typeface and a deeper visual/verbal representation on the specific
  area. \r\n\r\nSound like an interesting project? Perhaps not?\r\n\r\nWhat other
  area's of design would you recommend considering when using type?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n-
  typeface design\r\n- 3D type\r\n- interactive type\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think it's a very interesting project.\r\nI remember <a href=\"http://www.gov.nu.ca/english/font/\">Pigiarniq</a>,
    a typeface that was developed for a small region in Canada named Nunavut. \"...
    the government of the region has decided to design a new typeface to enable its
    28.000 citizens to use all four languages in a uniform manner.\"\r\nFrom a semiotic
    point of view, everything someone does has some kind of meaning because he/she
    did \"X\" instead of \"Y\". A sign is a representation of something, not the thing.
    And because of this, a sign is always the construction of meaning (when interpreted).\r\nThe
    reason why the Pigiarniq's Typographer opt for that shape of letters sure has
    some kind of meaning and this meaning sure is related to this region of Nunavut.\r\n\r\nOther
    areas of study, I suggest:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1214482389&sr=1-1\">The
    Elements of Typographic Style</a>, Robert Bringhurst (obvious)\r\nInformation
    Design (Edward Tufle's books)\r\nVisual Perception (Rudolf Arnheim's books)\r\nand
    perhaps it will help to take a look into Graphic Design history to see how typography
    has being used over the centuries in order to convey meaning. (perhaps <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/0471699020\">Meggs
    History of Graphic Design</a>?)\r\n\r\nHope this information helps...\r\n\r\nBest
    Luck for the project!"
