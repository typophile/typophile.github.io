  ahead and make more.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3-5rAZSJymzZDZiMDk4ZDgtMGVkZS00NTBhLTkxNzUtN2U5YTM2YjBjNDQ4&hl=en_GB&authkey=COKo-owP\r\n\r\nThey
  were initially for a logo so I only made a few characters but now I'm thinking of
  extending it into a font. They're pixel based for screen use although I might make
  outline versions for print later, I know very little about font creation. I'm not
  planning on making lower case characters because of time constraints.\r\n\r\nStrokes
  are 3px thick and I've tested that it also works with 2px and 1px strokes for smaller
  sizes. If anyone knows of anything similar, pixel based so it reproduces perfectly
  on screen at this kind of size, I'd be happy to hear about it.\r\n\r\nThanks all.
  \r\n\r\n"

    could try to make a fontstruction out of it (http://fontstruct.com/)"

    I see the similarity but mine feels modern whereas Bank Gothic feels retro. (I
    hate retro).\r\n\r\nI've bookmarked fontstruct too, I had no idea it existed.
    Thanks again.\r\n "
