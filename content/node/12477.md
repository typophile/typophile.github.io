  document I designed. I've never done this before, and don't have any Japanese character
  typefaces other than the ones that come with OS X. I'll be using InDesign CS. I
  really have no idea what to expect.\r\n\r\nCan anyone give me any tips/advice/warnings/recommendations

  the English was set in <a href=\"http://kentlew.com/Type.html\">Whitman</a>."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMay I presume that you know how to turn on the Kotoeri input method
    in the international control panel in System Preferences? Also I guess that you
    are not going to mix English and Japanese next to each other in a text. If not,
    it can be trickier than the simple tips that are suggested below:\r\n\r\n1. Fonts\r\nOS
    X comes with Hiragino fonts that you can set with. Osaka is the Japanese system
    font for menus. \r\n\r\n2. Styles\r\nIf you select Hiragino, it will provide you
    with three different styles with different weights. Mincho can be regarded as
    a Japanese counterpart of a serifed style, Gothic, a sans-serif, Maru, a sort
    of rounded sans-serif. Select a style that you want to set with Whitman. But consider
    that you may want to change the style of your choice after you actually set the
    text with different character sets of Japanese.\r\n\r\n3. Size, Weight\r\nWhen
    you compare the size of Whitman and the latin alphabet in Hiragino fonts, Hiragino
    is about 15% bigger than Whitman. Adjust the size to find the Hiragana and Katagana
    still appear about 10% bigger than the latin alphabet, which is normal for CJK
    fonts. There are several reasons for this, such as inter-stroke space considerations
    and the basic letter design space of CJK and so on, but this might help you to
    find the right font size to go well with Whitman. You may consider reducing Hiragino
    again about 3% if the Japanese text will not contain any Romanji, but please remember
    that whenever you reduce the size, the overall grayness--thickness of strokes--can
    get lightened so you should keep that in mind.\r\n\r\n4. Kanji\r\nIf you are to
    use Kanji as well, choose one Kanji character--better to pick a relatively complex
    looking one--which can feel like about as much bigger as the ratio between Kana
    and the latin alphabet depending on the glyph that you have chosen. This is tricky,
    as Kanji characters can have only one stroke to tens of them. I would keep the
    size the same as Kana, but, if your choice is Mincho, you may realize the strokes
    of Kanji are quite different from those of Hiragana and Katagana and the high
    contrast between thick and thin may ruin the compatibility of Whitman and Mincho
    style. But it is up to your decision and the text that you are going to set.\r\n\r\nI
    only hope that this helps you a bit. \r\nI am looking forward to hearing some
    more advice on this subject.\r\n\r\nSeonil"

  body: "Also keep in mind that InDesign has many features for setting text in Japanese,
    but they're poorly documented and are there mostly to support the Japanese version
    of InDesign, which is a much different (and more expensive) beast than its Western
    counterpart. Try to keep your first layout simple, and don't try to get everything
    right (i.e. setting the text vertically and right to left) unless you're asked
    to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you want to match Whitman, your best choices are probably
    Heisei Mincho or Hiragino Mincho. The Heisei family is bundled with Adobe CS.
    I think it might be a slightly better fit than Hiragino, which is more of a Times
    equivalent for Japanese.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Thank you very, very much, Forrest and Seonil. I've just gotten the copy
    about 10 minutes ago and am stumbling around quite a bit. I'm going to read over
    your tips in depth and integrate what I can.\r\n\r\nI'll let you know how it works
    out. Unfortunately, I can't show any layouts, as the information is proprietary,
    but I'll convey as much as I can."

  body: "So, I ended up using Hiragino Mincho (which the client liked), since I don't
    seem to have Heisei (is it part of an extras package?) It seemed to go well because
    one of my Japanese coworkers helped me make sure the type was the right size and
    she wrote: are you sure you don't speak Japanese? So I guess that's a sign that
    it's at least legible and readable.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help and advice.
    I'm sure my typesetting is still pretty rough, but it works. For the next time
    (next month) I'm going to apply your suggestions more carefully. There are a few
    English numbers and one or two email addresses sprinkled in the Japanse text,
    so that will complicate matters a bit.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part (aside
    from the obvious character differences) was the difference in acceptable point
    sizes. The smaller numbers were a bit disorienting. The other interesting part
    is the extra-smooth, rags that come from setting a series of individual glyphs,
    rather than grouped ones. Much of the text appeared fully justified. Is this acceptable?
    Should I be fully justifying? Or is allowing the slight variation in the rag OK?
    I suppose the left-to-right and horizontal layout makes many Japanese typographic
    conventions harder to achieve, either way.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what is 'Romanji'?"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nRomanji is the use of Roman characters to phonetically spell out
    Japanese (along the same lines as Pinyin for Chinese.) Some refer to any use of
    Roman characters in Japanese text as \u2018Romanji\u2019 even if it is not expressly
    used to spell out Japanese. "

  body: "Glad to know it helped.\r\n\r\nConcerning H&Js, there are some special text
    formatting functions that you may have to consider in addition to the usual H&J
    values. There is a rule called Prohibited Character Processing which strictly
    limits the use of certain characters in beginning or ending lines. To keep this
    rule, word processing applications automatically adjust lines according to the
    types of hyphenation options a user chooses.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that might interest
    you is that CJK are designed monospaced. It is actually typesetting systems that
    space Kana or Hangul (Korean script) proportionally. The soft ragged look is partially
    because of this and the above hyphenation algorithm. If you want to justify the
    spacing between every letter, you have to consider the fact that Japanese require
    no space between words. So it may affect the readability. The full justification
    is usually used in a table listing names and so on.\r\n\r\nAlso, as you set both
    English and Japanese horizontally, you have to be careful in setting the baseline
    grid for Japanese. CJK use different letter alignment systems and if you try both
    languages on the same baseline, they won't read comfortably. Depending on the
    font size that you choose for Hiragino, you might have to fiddle with a different
    grid system for the Japanese text to have them appear on the optically same baseline.\r\n\r\nYes,
    Romanji is just the Japanese equivalent to Roman or Latin characters (Romaja in
    Korean). Just as Hanji (Chinese), Kanji (Japanese), Hanja (Korean), Hantu (Vietnamese)
    refer all to Chinese characters or Han characters.\r\n\r\nIf you are further interested
    in CJK processing systems, there is an excellent reference site of Ken Lunde at
    http://www.praxagora.com/lunde/."
