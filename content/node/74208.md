body: "Hi there, my names Christopher and I have what my wife describes as an unhealthy
  obsession with type. You may probably understand this. I have recently started a
  new blog about all things typographic, especially about the type that surrounds
  us that most people don\u2019t see. I have begun to share my observations about
  my home town of King\u2019s Lynn in Norfolk, England and of the other places I go
  with my camera and my TypoRadar\u2122 turned up to thirteen. \r\n\r\nwww.mytypeof.wordpress.com
  \r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to get others involved in the project by sharing their own
  observations of the typography and lettering where they live; ordinary, unique or
  historical, official or illegal, old or new, sublime or substandard. It\u2019s the
  stuff that informs us everyday without being celebrated, unlike all the great new
  rebrandings, logos and posters that fill all the usual typographically biased websites.
  This part is called \u2018my type of\u2026place\u2019\r\n\r\nThere is other stuff
  on there too: printed ephemera from my own collection \u2013 not rare and valuable
  stuff to make others jealous, but things I have acquired over the years because
  they have made me smile, or think, or just go \u2018ooh!\u2019 You probably know
  what I mean\u2026 Maybe you have some interesting stuff that you\u2019d like to
  share with others too. This part is called \u2018my type of\u2026stuff\u2019\r\n\r\nI
  also plan to begin a section called \u2018my type of\u2026people\u2019 where the
  less prominent typographers, designers and letterers of all kinds will feature.
  Maybe you have a particular interest in someone who is less celebrated than the
  usual (type)faces, or know someone who is doing their own thing typographically,
  or still doing it all the old way. You may feel that you yourself could be featured
  here too. Who knows?\r\n\r\nHave a look and see what you think; it would be great
  if other Typophile members were to get involved. There is some information to download
  for anyone who may wish to contribute at the top of the blog, and maybe you could
  pass on the link to others who may be interested.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to add
  your comments to any of the current materials. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nChristopher
  Skinner\r\n"
