  body: "Personally, I feel a blog like that is in poor taste.\r\n\r\nI have a sense
    of humor. And I, too, find many of these proposals to be ridiculous.\r\n\r\nBut
    as a professional I feel that we should be ambassadors for our craft and recognize
    that many of these proposals are not as ridiculous as they seem. Unfortunately,
    many designers take these as an affront or an insult (or are simply looking for
    easy targets).\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that being an entrepreneur is rarely
    easy and it requires a lot of hustle. Most of these proposals are born out of
    the fact that many entrepreneurs have no budget for design. I applaud the hustle.
    If they can get the job done with a limited design budget... good for them.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the other side of this is that these people create opportunities for designers
    who are just starting out and want real-time experience. Very few skilled trades
    offer as many beginner opportunities as design."

  body: "\r\nyes..  of course you are right!\r\nbut it is friday\r\nand we all need
    a good smile or a laugh.\r\n\r\npersonally I am through with the hustle..  \r\nI
    can compromize with a client, but when they start waving their money and expect
    me to lick.. then I just simply throw my gun and walk away. it ain't worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    once had a client who wanted a site and they said: \"You are the designer. Do
    whatever you want!\" This was in 2001 before the advanced coding that came later,
    so it was not a large site. \r\nI worked for 2-3 months with the site. The client
    was not satisfied so she kept wanting changes after changes...  which I did. That's
    why it took so long time. It was minor changes..  but when the project had been
    going on for a while...  I said: \"We must complete it now\".\r\n\r\nThe client
    said we have to start over again and said she wanted to come to the bureau and
    we would do it together. She had an idea of what she wanted. \r\nI said fine and
    we decided a day, a saturday because I knew it would take a whole day and I did
    not want other clients calling. I just wanted it over and done with.\r\n\r\nThe
    client came and I did exactly what she wanted. I let her tell me how she wanted
    it, colours, text et al. She changed almost all of the text again.\r\nSo when
    she left the office she was all happy and thrilled. To me the site did not look
    good, but it was okay enough. The client was satisfied. And the last thing I said
    before the client left was: \"So now the project is completed. Right?\". \"Oh,
    Yes\", was the reply, \"You can send me the bill now!\" \r\n\r\nThe next day I
    get a call from the client, begging me to take the site off the web. \"It is a
    disaster...  and ugly!\"\r\n\u2014\"But you were here and you decided and I did
    exactly what you wanted!?\" was my reply.\r\n\r\nThe client said: \"You cannot
    send any bill till we are finished. I am going on a trip next week and will call
    you when I get back.\"\r\n\r\nI was somewhat irritated...  but what could I do?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    client did not call back until a half year later (I amn't kidding!!) and I had
    almost forgotten all about it and it was not even in my mind anymore.\r\n\r\nThe
    client said: \"I can come on saturday like last time. It was so fun, we had a
    great time and it went so good.\"\r\n\r\nI said: \"No thanks! I am not interested
    and I told them to find another designer.\"\r\n\r\n(although I wanted to say something
    else. Untypable and untypophile words)\r\n\r\n\r\nso yes they create opportunities
    for designers...  \r\nbut then they should treat the designers as designers\r\n\r\nbut
    what the H...  sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. That's life..\r\nbut I will
    never accept hustling anymore. period.\r\nYou can rattle all your jewellery +
    $$\r\n\r\nNO HU$TLE!!\r\nNo Money \u2014 No Honey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    The disconnect with our clients is an inevitable part of the business. Plumbers,
    we are not.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that 9 out of 10 potential clients will
    not fully appreciate/understand quality design work.\r\n\r\nDesign work is like
    dating. You gotta be picky or it's not gonna work out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
