body: "I have this recurring problem with setting text with InDesign.\r\nIt has to
  do with my use of soft and hard returns and then needing to change the leading.\r\nIt
  seems sometimes I can manually do it and then sometimes nothing happens.\r\nSorry
  if this vague but your opinions are needed.\r\nI also promise to use better tabs
  in the future."

  body: "This setup is all wrong. You should never insert any of those tabs. Set an
    indent for all the lines to your tab (i.e. 0.3) and then the first line indent
    to -0.3. Only use tabs to separate the bullet and the first character \u2013\_never
    for the following lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Right. To make the line break you just hit a soft return, no need for a bunch
    of tabs to get to the end of the line.
