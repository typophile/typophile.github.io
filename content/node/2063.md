  body: FWIW, the typeface that matches your &#34;TOMBSTONE&#34; sample was not shown
    in the Tuscan samples at MyFonts. That one is Adobe&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/mesquite/"
    target="_blank">&#34;Mesquite&#34;</a> &#40;which is part of the Adobe Wood Type
    collection mentioned in one of the threads Yves linked&#41;.
