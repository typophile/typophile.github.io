body: "Here's the opening spread from Machiavelli's 1506 Decemnale (first edition.)
  The typeface looks to be a Jenson or a close relative thereof. I'm looking for a
  font that matches the look of this letterpressed text. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grummedia/fifteen36/\">Fifteen36</a>
  \ looks very promising, but I am concerned that there's no bold, italic, or small
  caps. I'd prefer to buy a font family that would give me the most flexibility. P22's
  <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/sherwoodtype/mayflower.html\">Mayflower</a>  is a nice
  looking font, but I'm fairly certain I will go to hell for using a typeface from
  1610 in a book about Machiavelli (1469-1527.) Plus it's not Venetian, Florentine
  or anything else. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a nice antiqued Roman font from Machiavelli's
  era?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDon"

    or <a href="http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/jenson.html">LTC Jenson</a> might
    be a good place to start. William Morris idealized the look of the books from
    this period and did his utmost to create a nice dark color on the page with his
    types.

  body: "Tiffany, the P22 Morris Golden looks very close to what I'm looking for (though
    still missing a bold or italic) I already own Adobe's Jenson Pro, so I'm covered
    there, but for this specific project, I need a font (like the P22 Morris Golden)
    which is antiquated.\r\n\r\nI tried using Adobe Jenson, but the problem is a modern
    font rendered with razor sharp accuracy (like LTC Jenson or Golden Type) seems
    to float above my drawings. The organic look of a period typeface integrates much
    better with my pen & ink artwork. Even the clearest line I can make with a quill
    pen can't match the precision of Adobe or LTC Jenson.*\r\n\r\n* well, technically,
    I probably could, if I were using the smoothest hot press watercolor paper or
    Bristol board, but in this project I'm not."

  body: Hmm. This is a pretty specific request. Would you be willing to swing a little
    farther afield than Jenson? Did you notice the Golden Type link just above?

  body: "Tiffany, sorry, I guess I wasn't being clear. Apologies.\r\n\r\nThe P22 Morris
    looks very close to what I'm looking for. (Thank you for the pointer, by the way)
    It may be the font I choose, but before I shell out for it, I want to make sure
    I'm not missing anything.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be a Jenson variation, I'm
    definitely willing to \"swing farther afield.\" It just needs to be based on a
    Renaissance form, and it needs to be antiqued, so it has the appearance of being
    printed by letterpress (like the P22 Morris you pointed out.) For example, <a
    href=\"http://www.p22.com/ihof/telegdi.html\">Telegdi</a> is another I considered,
    but rejected because it is <em>too</em> distressed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDon"

    work would probably cost me more than my advance. ;-)\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I went
    with P22 Morris Golden (Thanks for the suggestion, Tiffany!) P22 does excellent
    work and I've had good luck with their fonts. I'll be using it for captions, book
    excerpts and written correspondence, and Operina Pro (also P22) for speech.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDon\r\n\r\noh
    yeah, and when I was in MyFonts with my credit card out I figured, well, I've
    already got the card out of the wallet, I might as well pick up this excellent
    Pacioli font. I might not use it in <em>Machiavelli</em> but then again, I'm still
    trying to figure out what I want to do with the chapter pages, so I wouldn't be
    surprised if it finds its way in there. Anyone know who designed it?"

    full Hypnerotomachia Poliphili which was published around that time by Aldus in
    Venice. I'm working on a clean version of it, but I could easily do a quick autotraced
    version if you like."
