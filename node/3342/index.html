		<div class="commentbody">What I usually do is to sneak a small digital camera into the theater. I sometimes have to sit through several showings to get good shots of the main titles, not to mention any other type that is used in a film&ndash;especially if it is used badly. <BR> <BR>As you might imagine, this is rather time consuming. Fortunately there are several theaters I know of that are in range of a WiFi hot spot. (It's more common than you might think, but, considering the density of Starbucks, not that surprising.) So, what I do is sneak my TiBook in as well. That way I can keep up with the Type ID Board and not miss out on getting the jump on anyone else here. <BR> <BR>I can usually ID fonts on sight, but there are many times I wish I had my type specimen books with me. (I used to bring Jaspert, McGrew, FontBook, and a few others, but it was killing my back.) Fortunately, with the WiFi connection, I can at least check the online specimens at MyFonts and the rest. <BR> <BR>Right now, in fact, I'm sitting through the second showing of The Haunted Mansion. It's really bad, but there is a scene near the beginning of the third act where they are looking at this &quot;old&quot; book and the title is set in Matrix (can you believe it?!). I would have gotten it in the previous showing, but an usher was standing nearby. It would have been too hard to explain. <BR> <BR>I should cut this short since the scene is coming up pretty soon. What's really annoying is, I bought a box of Milk Duds at the snack counter. I tried to eat too many at once and now I can't seem to get my tongue out of my cheek. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I haven't seen Kill Bill yet, so I can't help you with that one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Uhm, I actually do take pictures of the credits.. I guess that makes me look pretty stupid now.</i> <BR> <BR>Not really. That part wasn't far-fetched at all. There are people who bring video cameras, in fact. Back in college in the mid-seventies I brought a 35mm camera into a showing of 2001: A Space Odyssey and took a dozen or so pictures. I was a little obsessed with that movie at the time. <BR> <BR>I have to confess, my little story was partly inspired by a chapter in the book &quot;A Year At The Movies&quot; by Kevin Murphy. Murphy went to a different public showing of a movie every day for a year, and then wrote a book about it. On Thanksgiving, he managed to smuggle an entire Thanksgiving dinner into a theater under a very large overcoat. Pretty funny stuff.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So yeah&hellip; the Kill Bill titles&hellip; there are a few&hellip;  <BR> <BR>Avant Garde for the proverb, a bit of Busorama for the studio titles&hellip; pause for the prelude&hellip; okay there's some Friz Quadrata (bold), then I'll be damned if that's not Bookman (bold, ITC?) for the film title. Followed by some more Avant Garde and Friz, throwing in a bit of Palatino to mix things up, then more of the AG/FQ combo, then back to Palatino, and finally Avant Garde for the Chapter titles.  <BR> <BR>Certainly one of the more, er, 'typographically-rich' title sequences in recent memory. <BR> <BR>So the 'R' could be either Friz Quadrata or Palatino, but the non-closing 'g' could only be Friz, even though I don't recall seeing any lowercase&hellip;? <BR> <BR>Oh, and the end credits are Bookman again.</div>
