  new year.\r\n\r\nRight now we are having our \"Symbol Design\" course at the university.\r\nDay
  before yesterday we were given an assignment to find out the definitions of few
  of symbol design related terms. I asked few people and searched on internet too
  but today when we had the discussion in my class regarding those terms everyone
  had a different definition for the same term. And thus I got confused totally. Day
  after tomorrow we have yet another session and before that i want myself to know
  what exactly these terms are and where to use what? \r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone please explain
  these terms and the differences between them. \r\nI'd also appreciate if you can
  drop some links where i can study these terms.\r\n\r\nHere are the terms.\r\n\r\n>
  Symbol \r\n> Identity\r\n> Icon\r\n> logo\r\n> Index\r\n> Trademark\r\n> brand mark\r\n>

  body: "The problem with these terms is that to some people they have interchangeable
    meanings today. In the past, there were more meanings and differentiation. The
    term \"Logo\" is the biggest contender. Logo is short for logotype. Logo means
    \"word\" in Greek. To some degree, people use the term \"wordmark\" like the term
    logotype used to be used. It meant the name of the company or organization depicted
    typographically, like Ford. Later, the initials or acronym was also considered
    a logotype, like IBM. Monogram, like the TDC, is a style of configuration where
    initials may be superimposed on each-other or placed within a shape. This was
    a common practice years ago for stationary and even clothing (monogrammed shirts).
    A symbol was initially a graphic which represented some entity but letterforms
    were not required. The Nike swoosh is a symbol. A trademark was either a symbol
    or logotype which was legally endowed with the identification of a company or
    corporation. Trademarking involved government registry and search for availability.
    Brand used to mean a product brand like \"Rice Crispies\" but later came to mean
    the parent company which made the product as in the \"Kellogg's Brand\". The brandmark
    might be either the \"Snap-Cracle-Pop\" characters or the script \"Kellogg's\"
    name.\r\nIdentity was all the things involved with identifying a company including
    symbol or logo, colors layout of print matter, etc.\r\n\r\nToday though, everything
    is called \u201CBranding\u201D even if no product is involved. Corporate identity
    is even called branding. Everything used to identify a company is acalled a logo
    even if no letterforms are involved. The whole Branding buzz seems-to have been
    kindled from the marketing angle and has come to mean positioning a given organization
    to appeal to a certain set of customers\u2014trying to make them look like a duck.\r\n\r\nI
    am sorry for rambling so much (between phone calls here). I hope this helps clarify
    the very muddy waters that we now have in this business.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    There's a difference between symbol and icon, at least according to semiologists.
    Satya, I don't know how accurate you need to be but I'd be careful about this.
    Maybe you can check what C.S. Peirce has to say about this."

  body: "If I recall correctly, Peirce classifies signs according to these categories\r\n\r\nSymbol.
    A symbol is a sign related to the actual object by an artificial or very abstract
    convention. Words (printed or spoken) and abstract symbols such as the cross fall
    under this category. They have not actual relation to the thing.\r\n\r\nIndices.
    These are signs that refer to the actual object by indicating it's existance such
    as smoke to the fire or a pictogram.\r\n\r\nIcon. Is a sign used in substitution
    of the actual thing by resembling  it's qualities such as speed, color, texture,
    character, etc... most of brands fall under this category.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrademark
    and brandmark I suspect are more related to the US commercial and trading laws.\r\n\r\nMonogram
    is a logotype formed by the initials of a name.\r\n\r\nLogotype is type whose
    semantic quality exceeds that of a simple type labelling. Originally  logotypes
    were words casted in a single slug for type composition.\r\n\r\nBrand is the semantic
    construction of a corporation's identity by means of it's communication and way
    of being.\r\n\r\nIdetity is the perception built in the mind of a public of a
    corporation's being.\r\n\r\nMark is the core element of a Brand. It's visual device
    composed of an icon or a logotype or both, a color scheme and a graphic system.\r\n\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    are linked to typography and information design, the most obvious is probably
    an alphabetical list (of subjects in a book/article), it can also mean to create
    and use symbols which act with a key for a map or illustration, or the printer's
    fist (the hand with the <em>index</em> finger pointing). there are also meanings
    linked to mathematics, a pointer in a measuring instrument or computing. Hopefully
    this hasn't confused things even more.\r\nTim"

  body: "I knew using Chris's picture would lead to trouble, but someone else started
    it. Since it looks like the animal handler at Bembo's Zoo, though, its a most
    interesting example. I would call it a strong avatar.\r\n\r\nMy proposed definition
    is based on the classical definition, adding in my suspicions of how it came to
    be defined like we use today, inspired by cyberpunk literature.\r\n\r\nI think
    the original vision was that by now we were supposed to have throbbing surreal
    3D virtual-raves for an internet, that we waltzed about like supermen, while data
    and applications labored to serve our virtual identities. However, in reality,
    we never got hover cars by 2000, we don't all \"see\" the matrix code as redheads
    (without decoding software), and we can't even get one standard for instant messaging.\r\n\r\nBut
    if the internet is indeed cyberspace, than the icons that represent \"actual\"
    people, would be avatars. When I describe them as such people always have distinguished
    them from other icons in a UI immediately with no pre-discussed scenario.\r\n\r\nIn
    massively-multiplayer online RPG's, the worlds are generally populated with hordes
    of 3D characters, each individually directed, but these similar things are rarely
    called avatars. Funny, since most of the activity bypasses the role-playing factor,
    and the characters are as distinct from their owners as the doggy in Monopoly.
    I think this is because the character is intended to be \"not you\" in this case,
    so it cannot be your avatar.\r\n\r\nI think there are various strengths of avatars,
    as well. Chris's shows what he looks like and what he is 'about' and some of his
    mirth, so it is strong. To glance up, Tiffany's is fair, because it hints at what
    she does (it's type-designey), and suggests some official relation to Typophile.com.
    Mine is okay. It shows a part of a logo, and some punctuation. But hey, how easy
    is it upload your essence into a 40x40 box?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz
