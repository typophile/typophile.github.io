<div class=commentbody>well, jared the apple engineers have been concentrating their time on performance and interface aspects of the operating system. this is in response to the biggest criticisms. i'm sure they are also aware of designer's concerns around font issues. <br> <br>some bad news: adobe will not develop ATM for OS X, and its not clear if they are continuing development of ATM at all, as they are taking the unprecedented move of recommending competitor's products. <br> <br>http://www.adobe.com/products/adobesupportsOSX.html <br> <br>good news: extensis will soon provide full support for OS X. <br> <br><a href=http://www.extensis.com/suitcaseten/fonts_and_osx.html target=_top>http://www.extensis.com/suitcaseten/fonts_and_osx.html</a> <br> <br> <br>OS X provides also full support for Unicode typefaces.

<div class=commentbody> In regards to ATM, i believe that Apple will supply the same functionality ATM in the next major release (not x.1, perhaps x.?). The Font Panel is already halfway there in terms of organization, and Apple has very good Font engineers. Still, my office will be buying Suitcase X for now. <br> <br>What is more disconcerting is the lack of support from font creation software for OS X. We're likely to never see an update of any sort to Fontographer, and it runs very oddly in Classic, although it functions. And the DTL haven't even considered the option of making a version of the new FontMaster package for Mac OS X. </div>

<div class=commentbody> hrant, i haven't noticed any decline or increase at apple concerning font development. i know they are very involved in the development of font formats and usage, don't forget apple and adobe are the reason fonts work as well as they do. also, apple has always had type engineers on staff to ensure type compatibility within the operating system. i wish i could find the apple url of type utilities but its not in any obvious place. </div>

<div class=commentbody> An after thought... <br> <br>I find it hard to believe that Apple would drastically shift gears to the exclusion of their strongest user bases, the creative fields and education. <br> <br>My hope is that they can rally the industry (including font creation software makers) to come out in full support of OS X.

<div class=commentbody> personally, i look forward to OS X stability as well as a true multitasking environment. i've seen illustrator 10, and its going to be great for Mac users after the terrible version 9. imagine ripping a huge pdf document in the background while burning a cd at the same time as working in photoshop in the foreground. we don't even realize how slow and unproductive OS 9 is. all of our work habits have been crafted to work around its weaknesses. apple isn't going to abandon anyone, that's why they created carbon, any app written in carbon will work natively in X or while booted in 9. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hi all, <br>I am a newcomer for the forum and I was thinking to start a thread like this before I found this one. I LOVE OSX and I am using it from public beta. This OS is great, has something (speed, some rough edges...) to be improved, but it is great. The problem is that all the "big guys" doesn't like Apple too much. The applications on X are few and you cannot use it for your everiday work. Adobe, Quark and Macromedia are slow and dubious about supporting the new OS. Fontographer probably will never be ported as I read (between lines) on the macromedia forum. I think that Type designer community should start an open project with donation to self build a new font software for OSX, wich has a lot of power and beauty to give to a software like this one. I hope to have feedbacks from all of you. <br>Luke <br> <br>PS: sorry for my bad english </div>

<div class=commentbody> If you're only using the public beta, you should <br>know that fully 2 revisions have been made to <br>the OS. The 1.1 upgrade fixes the speed of the <br>interface that you mention. <br> <br>Also, Adobe just announced that Illustrator 10 <br>is shipping for OSX--but as with any major <br>new release from Adobe I'd wait a few months <br>for their bug fixes. <br> <br>At Seybold SF, the Quark rep said the <br>soon-to-be-released XPress 5 will run under <br>OS 9 (OS X can run OS 9 apps). He wasn't <br>sure of plans for a native OS X version. <br> <br>I'm sure that all of this stuff is just a matter of <br>time...

<div class=commentbody> Any ideas on how to start an open project for a type design program? The current options are all awful. Even an X-windows version would work with OSX.

<div class=commentbody> To Joe: <br>I am running 10.1 on a G4 400 with 2GB of RAM (that OSX uses in full, OS9 doesn't). It is definitely usable but not a speed demon. I also tried illustrator 10, a thing of a beauty but not a speed demon. Someone should shake Quark but, dunno how. Aniway InDesign (wich I prefer over XPress) is coming on X (with its version 2.0). I agree with you that it's a matter of time, but I think Apple has no lots of time. They need OSX to catch up and to do so they need apps. Running apps in Classic mode is not very nice, so my bucks goes only to ported products, I LOVE that "new" platform. <br>To Christian: <br>I dunno how to start the thing, but I am ready to donate too. We should probably start a website to promote the thing and see if any developer will get on board. This website is something related to Hoefler Type Foundry, could be a good to have the masters as testimonials. I have read on Pyrus website that they are available to developers to share knowledge at reasonable fees. My question is, why aren't they doing the OSX version? Probably someone will answer. I really think OSX will be a joy to work with for type designers. <br>Cheers, <br>Luke </div>

<div class=commentbody> Without wanting to start a war on the subject of MacOSX I just thought I'd say that I never want to have to (up?)grade to it. I run 9.1 and admin for 3 or 4 friends who have seen OSX and rejected outright the radically different and unfriendly interface. They run 9.2 and although it's far from perfect it is at least familiar. </div>

<div class=commentbody> I run OSX 10.3 and not being too savvy with operating systems I have found the change from 9.2 a bit confusing at times. However, the performance increase has made it well worth the upgrade as I run dual processor 533 G4/120 gig HD. Without OSX the second processor was practically useless. The OSX is a bit more stable as well (but still crashes occasionally as I drive it hard and long hours crunching 300 meg files all the time). I am guessing the real advantage is with Photoshop 7.0. I will be getting this within the next couple of weeks and I will report back if there is substancial performance increase. <br>I must say as far as type is concerned there is a few things i don't care for. You will need Extensis Suitcase, which will run fine on Freehand 10. I use FH10 as wellas Fh 5.5 (5.5 has less features and runs faster ) with FH 5.5 Extensis does simply not work, by that I mean it will not render screen fonts so it is hard to see what you are doing untill you convert to paths. I am guessing the tthat I could use ATM font manager but I am a bit scared of running 2 font managers as I think this would come with problems. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Probably the most important thing to know about MacOS X and fonts is the ludicrous number of places that they can live - there isn't a single unified Font folder as there is in MacOS 9. Rather, they can live in one of about 5 different folders (as I recall). Also, Fonts installed under MacOS X are not automatically available to applications that are running under Classic. <br> <br>I'd advise on getting a copy of Suitcase which will help with arranging big collections. Plus it offers a bridge between font collections under X and Classic modes. <br> <br>Incidentally, I've heard of certain problems relating to kerning (lost kerning pairs) and type rendering over certain type sizes - might be worth Googling it. <br> <br>As for the font library, I dont think you will have a problem. X handles all modern formats for Mac (TT, OT, PS T1) and even PC format TT. <br> <br>Hope this is of some help! I've a few books on X in my bedroom somewhere, if you want, I can check out which ones discuss type matters and give you a recommendation. <br> <br>David (Running X since July 2001) <br>Currently running MacOS X 10.1.4 </div>

<div class=commentbody> So, I've taken the plunge and have a brief <br>moment to come up for air (this thing's deep.) <br> <br>X is pretty sweet and somewhat <br>overwhelming at times.

<div class=commentbody> Nice point.

InDesign does everything I need to <br>do, and does it more intuitively than Quark can. <br> <br>It won't be as long until people see the light. <br>Interestingly, Apple's push to OSX is also pushing InD. <br>I'm glad. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, Adobe has a long history of innovation. <br> <br>There's been no real progress in Quark since <br>v4.0 back in what, 1997?
