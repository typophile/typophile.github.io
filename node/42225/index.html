Dont want to add any other discution about it.
My question is:
Want to buy a PC laptop for graphic design/type design/multimedia development.
So I use photoshop/freehand (perhaps upgrad to illustrator&hellip;)/flash/premiere/dreamweaver.
What do &ldquo;Typophile&rdquo; pros use?
Brand and model&hellip;Pros and againt
Thanks in advance</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Second, a general comment: brand and model are interesting, but key specs are at least as important. For example, I have a Lenovo (&ldquo;IBM&rdquo;) ThinkPad T61P. But how I got that configured (screen size/resolution, memory, hard drive size) is a lot more relevant.</p>
<p>Generally, I recommend that you get 2 GB of RAM. Regular 32-bit Windows can&rsquo;t address more than 3 GB, and any less than 2 GB is a false economy for performance. If your budget is tight, you&rsquo;re better off getting a slower processor but still getting 2 GB of RAM. For whatever model you pick, you probably want the biggest hard drive you can reasonably afford before the prices start escalating crazily.</p>
<p>Related to screen size, a host of related questions: Will you be using an external monitor for most of your serious work, or will you be relying on the built-in LCD screen of the laptop most of the time? Do you have good eyesight and a high tolerance for small stuff on screen? How much What format of outlines are you likely to mainly be working on? (Which is implicitly looking for &ldquo;what em square size are you likely to be working with in your type design work?&quot;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve used Sony laptops (definitely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recommended), Toshiba laptops (pretty good, but I had repetetive trouble with hard drives), and a Panasonic &lsquo;Toughbook&rsquo; (a nice lightweight travel machine, but a bit slow). But by far the best computers I have bought have been from Dell. I have one large Dell Inspiron 9100 laptop that I&rsquo;ve used as my main machine for the past three and a half years, and recently bought the small Dell XPS 1330 to use as a travel machine. I particularly like the customisability of Dell computers: I maximised the RAM and got the fastest CPU option for the XPS 1330, and it is blisteringly fast compared to my older Dell.</p>
<p>Thomas, as I understand it, 32-bit Windows only provides applications with a 3GB flat virtual address space, but kernel components will address a separate gigabyte. So 4GB is the actual limit (which is what I got in my XPS, and I hope I didn&rsquo;t waste money on an unused gigabyte of RAM!). But in order to provide access to the full 3GB, either the computer manufacturer or administrator needs to set the /3GB flag in the boot.ini (in pre-Vista versions of Windows)</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791558.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791558.aspx</a></p>
<p>or the IncreaseUserVA in BCDEdit (Windows Vista)</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa906211.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa906211.aspx</a></p>
<p>If you are buying a computer with more than 3GB of RAM, you may reasonably expect the manufacturer to set this, but you can ask them to confirm this.</p>

<p>Macromedia made Freehand multipage because they didn&rsquo;t have a pagination option. Adobe does with InDesign. AI is primarily for vector illustrations, and I don&rsquo;t see it becoming multi page (although perhaps a two or four page option would be nice to be able to keep front and back, or packaging options in a single file.</p>

<p>Freehand was a really great multi-purpose tool. Had it gotten the care and attention it needed several versions back, it might have been an excellent page layout application in addition to a fine illustration tool.</p>
<p>I do miss Freehand.</p>
<p>Alas, it&rsquo;s dead. In fact, it&rsquo;s been on life support for quite a while, even when it was still in Macromedia&rsquo;s hands.</p>

I always draw my company labels and boxes in freehand. It was great to have a file with mutiple pages. One for original other converted to paths to production, other in cmyk for other prints, and special the file with another blueprint page with regular information printed to be send in Fax or to print a copy to be sign, etc.
The fact that I could develop a logo in a page then duplicate in the same file several &ldquo;directions&rdquo; and print them all as independent page with the need to open extra files (and the time consuming&hellip;) are things that were with me.
Of course today I can di that with Indesign&hellip;but 12 years ago I could do it with freehand&hellip;and still do:-)</p>

<p>I recommend going to the Dell website, selecting a base model of the size you want, and then going through the customisation options to get the specs you want. If screen resolution is important to you, keep an eye out for the 1920x1200 screen options.</p>

<p>Though it isn&rsquo;t the same thing, you might like the &ldquo;layers&rdquo; function in Illustrator; each layer can be turned off, locked, set to print or not print, act as template, or whatever; then you can discard certain layers and save the file as a different version. I think &ldquo;export visible layers&rdquo; would make things easy. That might do some of what Freehand did for you. Layers are absolutely essential to working with map data.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I switched to PC a few years ago (because I am a reactionary, OK?), so I say this not as an apple fangirl: don&rsquo;t go Dell for a laptop!!!  Everyone I know with a Dell laptop has had it fall apart in a couple of years, and it&rsquo;s better to remove your eyes with a spoon than talk with their tech support.  Also, it takes an awful lot to get rid of all the bloatware that comes with their computers.  Spend the extra money on something with good hardware and tech support (HP? IBM? I dunno).</p>
<p>Right now I work exclusively on a silent PC desktop built by my boyfriend - it works like a charm, was under $1000 (including the 22&quot; monitor), and had no bloatware.  Unfortunately, that helps not at all for laptops.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

MacBook Pro 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15 inch costs in US $2,499.00. In Portugal costs 3,532.89 !!!!!!!!! With this money I could fly to New york buy the computer and come back and probably still save some money :-)</p>
<p>Beth (against) and other (in favor) spoke for Dell. Dell computers are hard to find here also.</p>
<p>The easy and economic are HP, Sony, Acer, Asus, Fujitsu Siemens and Toshiba.</p>

I have to check wich models have 1920x1200 screen option.</p>
<p>Any further comments?</p>

<p>My current laptop is a Titanium Powerbook 667 and it runs very well with nary a squeak of a problem. And I know that I am not the only one who hangs on to their Powerbooks. I have never heard of a PC laptop that will be reliable and in use some seven years down the track. I fully expect mine will last for another two years, bringing it to nine years old.</p>

<p>You did ask &ldquo;what do the pros use?&rdquo; One of the reasons the pros have Macs is because it helps them hike their rates. Put yourself in the shoes of a client - two designers are pitching for a job - one&rsquo;s charging $90 an hour and toting a four year old HP notebook, the other&rsquo;s charging $120 an hour and has a spanking new Mac Book Air - which would you pick?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard such things. But I&rsquo;ve been using my big Dell for three and a half years without any problems, and the couple of times I needed to call tech support the service was excellent. Now, I did pay extra for a business support account, and I did choose a high-end model with the best component options. Perhaps this makes a difference.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You mentioned ASUS. They&rsquo;re actually quite good because they supply the parts to a lot of the &ldquo;branded&rdquo; laptops. Quality hardware.</p>
<p>In fact, if you do a little digging, a lot of the big time laptops are really re-branded something or another.</p>
<p>For instance, Alienware machines are in reality just a few doodads and whatsits and glowing-eyed alien cases added onto other company&rsquo;s hardware. Start comparing specs and Googling/newegg-ing/researching, and eventually you can find the source of the base computer.</p>
<p>If you can find it, many times you can save money due to the &ldquo;brand&rdquo; discount. Of course, you&rsquo;re taking a humongous risk because tech support will be non-existent or Japanese :)</p>

<p>Sii, if I liked them equally, I&rsquo;d pick the one without the Apple premium.</p>
<p>If I could afford a new, awesome, Mac, I&rsquo;d get one - but it would be in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of it being a status symbol.  My focus is on usability and communication - if a client wants me to have a trendy haircut, designer jeans, and a MacBook, it&rsquo;s just not gonna work out.

<p>So, based on your reply about screens and monitors, the other key thing I&rsquo;d say is that you have the same screen need I do: at least 1200 vertical pixels of resolution to be able to do type design work efficiently right on your laptop. You can get a standard-ratio screen at 1600 x 1200, or a wide-screen at 1920 x 1200. But this factor alone will likely significantly narrow your choices - which is probably helpful.</p>
<p>John Hudson and others are correct about RAM on PCs. I&rsquo;m not saying that more than 2 GB is completely wasted, just that the biggest functional jump and bang for the buck is going from 1 GB to 2 GB. If you make heavy use of Premiere, maybe even 4 GB would be useful.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

		<div class="commentbody">They make plenty of Dells and stuff now with the same quad-core processors that the Mac Pros use (although they use two), but in agreement with the second post, worry about the ram as well. 2gigs is fantastic. Maybe more if you&rsquo;re doing motion (also, a better graphics card would help). I know you don&rsquo;t want a mac, but my suggestions would be to look at the specs on the new mac pro, and find a PC with the same. It&rsquo;d probably be about a grand less just to get rid of the apple logo.</div>
