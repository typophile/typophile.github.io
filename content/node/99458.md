    by [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Studio-Museum-in-Harlem-Artists-in-Residence-Catalog/6397433|Studio
    Lin]] for this occasion. BTW, can't stop thinking of some fonts by [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts|Colophon]]
    like [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu|Raisonn\xE9]] or [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/raisonne|Aper\xE7u]]."
