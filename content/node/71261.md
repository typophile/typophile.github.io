  body: "Utopia was my first thought, too, but the details are off, no? For example,
    aperture and counter of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018e\u2019, or the length of the
    \u2018p\u2019 descender."

  body: "It looks close to a lot of Baskervilles, but I can't find an exact. Sabon
    and Minion are also close.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nPublico is it! Well done."
