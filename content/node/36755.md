body: "\r\nI haven't be able to find a comprehensive review of Avenir Next online.
  Has anyone used it in a design project juicy enough to give it a run down vs. the
  old Avenir?\r\n\r\nOn screen via the website (not the best test I know), \r\n *
  the jump from UltraLight to Regular seems extreme (with no Light in between)\r\n
  * the Heavy (which looks much heavier than Avenir Black), seems to have lost a little
  neutrality of personality, esp. in the lowercase\r\n\r\nThe small caps and new italics
  sound nice, but without the choice to buy individual weights, it seems pretty scary
  to drop USD 1200 on an update that almost seems more geared towards print designers
  (where the new weight distribution, condensed and s.c. probably come in handy).
  (I design mostly websites). \r\n\r\nAny impressions would be appreciated."

    Once i searched for this, but i haven't found  one. Dan (Reynolds), please help
    us :)\r\n\r\nPS\r\nWhat i find interesting in Avenir Next are especially the condensed
    weights. Not so much interest in italics and OSF. "

  body: I do not like the idea of "real" italics for Avenir or any of the Linotype
    revamps. If Frutiger had wanted it originally, why didn't he do it then? It's
    not like he couldn't have done it. It seems like a marketing ploy of dubious value
    to me.

  body: "We do not have a PDF available at the moment, but quite a lot of this is
    discussed in the Avenir Next brochure, which we give away at most design conferences
    we attend.\r\n\r\nDan, creating individual fonts used to be very expensive, much
    more than it is today. Frutiger used obliques to save money. This was a big deal
    back in the day, especially when one remembers that Frutiger designed a lot of
    big families. Now that font production can be done by one or two people instead
    of 100 or 200 people, the situation has changed. Note that Avenir Next also has
    small caps and oldstyle figures (AF was directly involved in the OsF design, as
    can be seen in the brochure)."

    Avenir Next Condensed matches Avenir Next.\r\n\r\nDan, sorry, type was incredibly
    expensive in 1988. While the hostility? :( \r\nMuch of the type was still created
    by hand at Linotype back then (hand drawings were made, which were then hand digitized).
    Dozens of people worked on the design of a single font. Very expensive, and not
    at all like today.\r\n\r\nEven if it was not that much more expensive to create
    a real italic than an oblique, Frutiger thought that it was. And it is the thought
    that counts ;-)\r\n\r\nPlus, a designers intentions change over time. Hermann
    Zapf is directly involved in the design of his fonts, even the new ones\u2026\_character
    by character. Some of the decisions he makes now might be different from those
    of 40 years ago, or even 15 years ago. Everyone learns with experience, even the
    best. They just keep getting better, I guess. Who knows?"

    is also explained in the brochure. Akira wanted to make the family more robust,
    more able to tackle all sorts of advertising design problems. Like Futura can.
    Think of Futura's different weights. This is also where Akira sought for the idea
    behind suggesting a condensed version."

  body: "Hmm, I wish I had that brochure! \r\n\r\nI think the lack of online information
    about Avenir Next highlights a need for more online marketing prowess by type
    foundries. Some are of course doing this really well, but there is a lot of room
    for improvement. \r\n\r\nPlaying the role of the selfish consumer, why should
    I fly to an expensive design conference to get sales materials for a product I
    might buy several times a year for the rest of my career? Shouldn't the seller
    bring this info to me where I am? Online test-drives and pdf specimens are a start,
    but might not be enough to push a lot of designers over the edge to purchase the
    font. \r\n\r\nFor a redesign like Avenir Next, just a few hours in Photoshop could
    produce informative graphics that show what's changed and why it's an improvement.
    A simple online gallery could house hundreds of photos of the font being put to
    the test in actual design work (Underware does a great job with this), with little
    effort from the foundry (after the initial web development).\r\n\r\nDon't mean
    to sound preachy, but as a fan and consumer of type, I see a lot of potential
    to make buying type feel less like a leap of faith and more like a confident,
    informed decision."

    Avenir Next had just been released, so the timing was terrific.\r\n\r\nOnce we
