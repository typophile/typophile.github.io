		<div class="commentbody">Micah <BR> <BR>I would think that there is no reason to assume that any particular face would have been used. Laurence J. Johnson's Caslon was a fairly common American face at that time. A Google search might serve you well or go to one of the Mark Twain sites.  <BR> <BR>Clemens did serve as a printer's devil as a youth (nice photo of him holding a composing stick on the cover of one of the back issue <em>Printing History</em> journals) and, interestingly enough, he is considered the first author to submit a manuscript using the typewriter. And lost a bunch of money in the development of a mechanical typesetting machine.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, Thanks. <BR> <BR>I was strongly leaning towards Caslon (Adobe's)&hellip; <BR> <BR>I did quite a bit of disappointing Google searching before posting here. :-( <BR> <BR>Because of his experience in printing, I rather suspected he might have had a hand in choosing the design of his books, but I also was prepared to strongly disagree with how the first prints were set; particularly in choice and use of face. Still, knowing what was originally chosen could help me to make intelligent choices of my own, as in keeping with the original spirit as possible&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Micah <BR> <BR>If you are thinking of a digital and would like to get close to the Johnson Caslon try Lanston's Caslon Oldstyle 337. It is pretty much right on the money a very good rendition of the metal Monotype version, which is considered the truest to the Johnson. The Johnson type itself was said to cast from original Caslon punches or matrices (I forget which).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>And lost a bunch of money in the development of a mechanical typesetting machine.</i> <BR> <BR>The machine was called the &quot;Paige Typesetter&quot;. Paige is spelled correctly, it was named after the inventor. <BR><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/yankee/cymach6.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/yankee/cymach6.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/yankee/cymach6.html</a></a> I ordered photocopies of the mechanical drawings from the patent office. Patent office photocopies were very reasonable. The response to this particular request met with heated resistance. It was, I believe they said, the largest patent ever filed. Linotype ended up with two machines, they needed some of the patents. One the machines were donated to the museum, the other to the war effort.  <BR> <BR>We saw great &quot;financial wisdom&quot; in cancelling our order. I think trucking was the problem.</div>
