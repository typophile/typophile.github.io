  Pro W4 typeface (Hiragino Maru Gothic Pro W4) but am finding that certain glyphs
  are missing (please see top part of attached image). Are these glyphs just not available
  in this typeface or is there some kind of workaround?\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble
  finding the glyph set to determine which characters should be available. I understand
  that this may be a standard OS X typeface so that may be part of the issue.\r\n\r\nDo
  you have any chinese round sans serif typeface recommendations like this one but
  in a complete set?\r\n\r\nThanks for any assistance that you can provide.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/w4_4015.png]"
