  of the Stamperia Valdonega,\r\nbefore the opening of the book fair in Leipzig?\r\n\r\nI
  feel boring and wondering if anyone wants to speak about it..\r\n\r\nStefan"

    visit to the Museum f\xFCr Druckkunst in Leipzig pays, anyway. And the Mardersteig
    exhibition is really very impressive. If you have the opportunity, I strongly
    advise you to go there.\r\n\r\nAlas, the photos hardly convey the ambiance that
    emanates from the numerous exhibits. As I couldn\u2019t really capture the books\u2019
    formidable spirit, I just picked a couple of interesting details.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way: the <a href=\"http://hsl.chalco.net/erez4/fsi4/fsi.swf?pages_server=http://hsl.chalco.net/erez4&pages_dir=FSI%5FPages/hyphen/Demo/grafiche%20SIZ/LIPSIA/&cfg=pages_presets/catalog.fsi&Skin=plain&pages_pagecolor=000000&pages_slider=0&pages_index=1&MouseModes_Mode2=0&pages_skin=plain&pages_pagebordercolor=999999&pages_menu=1&pages_BendEffect=none\">accompanying
    catalogue</a> is online at the <a href=\"http://www.stamperiavaldonega.it\">Stamperia
    Valdonega website</a>, as a Flash file that can be searched, browsed and zoomed."

    books and browse through their pages. They all are behind glass (of course)."

    directly with Mardersteig.\r\nMaybe he will show you something, to touch also.
    ;-)\r\nI you want I can ask him.\r\nAnd by the way: Verona is always worth a journey
    for it\u2019s definitely the most beautiful city in the world!\r\n\r\nwishes\r\nStefan"
