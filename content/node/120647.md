body: "This month I finally created a typeface that I feel happy about (maybe even
  too happy). This is just a compilation of different forms and ideas that I find
  appealing. I think I will also do a monospaced version. Some letters still have
  the a kinda \"default\" look, but I think that even in this early stage the personality
  of the typeface stands out?\r\n\r\nOr does it?  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/01_1.png\"

  body: "Pretty cool design. I like its playfulness. I don't quite know what kind
    of feedback to give on this though. I could tell you to condense n/m/u a bit more
    so the white space matches the counters of other letters, I could tell you to
    expand the D a bit, to decrease the top bowl of B, to slightly rotate S/s to the
    right, to raise the tittles in i/j, to fix the dark spot in 4 and to balance the
    t better, but honestly I find these irregularities rather charming. It's not an
    all-purpose typeface but I can certainly see its application. What is this typeface
    intended for though? If it's meant to be playful I wouldn't change things drastically.
    If you're attempting to design a well balanced typeface which is useful for much
    broader applications then I think you need to polish quite a bit. I wouldn't do
    that though. I'm actually trying to develop a more impulsive approach to type
    design, where I'm less concerned with consistency and more with creative shapes,
    such as I see here. I'm fond of Eyal Holtzman's work for this very reason.\r\n\r\nI
    would however make the hyphen shorter and thicker. Right now it looks like an
    en-dash. On that note, did you also add the en-dash and em-dash? I'm asking because
    in the text you're using a hyphen in the bottom left column where you should be
    using an em-dash."

  body: "Hi Martin.\r\n\r\nFirst off, sorry about the dashes/hyphens. I was in a rush
    to post this here so I forgot to draw them and these are the defaults.\r\n\r\nI
    never thought about what is this typeface intended for. I just saw a combination
    of ideas that would work and executed it. But I've made display faces only until
    now this is the closest thing I have to a standard Sans Serif. I imagine that
    the monospaced version will be suitable for a programming font, but I have to
    produce it first.\r\n\r\nYour feedback is great. I will definitively change some
    of the things you listed.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It has a nice rustic look to it. I would reduce the width of the space though,
    for both the bold and regular weight. By reducing the width of the space or spacing
    the other letters looser you will get a more even texture. The punctuation is
    probably too light.

  body: "It's hard to make out in the pixelated image at the top, but my impression
    is that the light version has very uneven stroke widths, both between letters
    and within them. I'm having trouble parsing that as \"playful\", and would recommend
    fixing this.\r\n\r\nThe bold looks like it has significantly better-balanced stroke
    widths for some reason, and looks more useful. Here I can see a bit of the \"playfulness\"
    that Martin mentions. It reminds me of DIN up close and of Comic Sans at small
    sizes...\r\n\r\nIn both cuts, the spur of /G and the serifs of /i/j strike me
    as too timid; either make them distinct or lose them. The /t looks lopsided, though
    perhaps in character. Some of the glyphs are top-heavy, but probably by design
    (?)."

  body: In the PDF I also notice the /u is too wide and /M and /f should be wider.
    As Craig said, pay attention to the counter sizes. Make sure the white space is
    more or less equal in each character to improve the rhythm and texture of the
    text.

    the same letter).

  body: It might be weird but it's not exceptional. When you turn /n upside down it
    always looks wider. /u should always be a bit more condensed than /n. Letters
    always require optical corrections, whether the basic shape is largely the same
    or not. My b/d/p/q are never perfect copies of each other, either. Optical corrections
    are always required.

  body: "Better, but there's still a lot going on that needs to be fixed. H and S
    could be wider, I_r is too close together, the tittles on i/j should be higher
    (at around the height of where the terminal of /f ends), the /f should be wider,
    the crossbar of /t should be longer on the right while its terminal should be
    condensed a bit (and so should the tail of /j), the /v is too light, the diagonals
    in /k could extend a bit further and the /r is too heavy in the join.\r\n\r\nThere's
    also something going on in the rendering. For example, in 'abolish' I see the
    /h with a thinner right vertical, the next /h looks good and the last /h in the
    text has a thinner stem. This makes it more difficult to check the typeface for
    inconsistencies. I just downloaded the PDF to see if it's the same on my computer.
    It was. I then zoomed in on your typeface to look if I can identify where the
    rendering problem comes from. I've found it. For starters, your horizontals are
    thicker than your verticals. Note that horizontals always look optically thicker
    than verticals, so you need to compensate for that. But this is only the start
    of the issues with this typeface. If you look at the /n for example, you have
    a very thick shoulder, thinner stems and the weight of the typeface is all clumped
    together near the join. That's exactly where you don't want the weight to be.
    Make the horizontals thinner and move the weight at the top of the shoulder to
    the right and decrease the weight in the join. I can recommend reading this short
    tutorial I wrote on dark spots in type design: http://martinsilvertant.deviantart.com/journal/Dark-spots-in-type-design-322930112\r\n\r\nAlso
    have a look at the resources on this page: http://temple-of-typefaces.deviantart.com/journal/Type-resources-276795259\r\nI
    think the Type Workshop might be particularly useful to you.\r\n\r\nAlso, here's
    one of 3 tutorials I did on type design; this one is on designing a sans serif:

  body: Because your lines are not consistent in thickness. However, the vertical
    strokes seem to be consistent so perhaps that's not it. I've actually had the
    same problem with one of my recent typefaces while I'm absolutely sure the verticals
    are exactly the same, so I don't know what this is. I auto-hinted the fonts to
    make sure the problem wouldn't present itself on the web. So far I believe it's
    only in PDFs.
