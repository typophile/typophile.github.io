  body: Good catch fvilanakis! Don't think that's the one, even customized but it's
    a nice alternative. Reminds me also [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/skolar-basic/|Skolar]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/tabac/|Tabac]] (G3 or G4). I guess
    with a name like this "TYPOFLY", there are some possibilities it could have been
    drawn by the "Luka" himself. The easiest way would probably to ask directly to
    him by email.

    me of Unger. Oversized inktraps: check, chunky serifs: check, ligatures that draw
    attention to themselves: check. Darn, I wish type designers wasn\u2019t such a
    herd.\r\n\r\nAnd oh, the top line might not be the same typeface as below."

    hopefully but a phase, and mainly a result of too easy access to the means of
    production. They will all be forgotten tomorrow. '

    advertising, etc. Aesthetic trends are part of that and always will be. Aesthetically,
    jumping on stylistic bandwagons can be see as tired by those in the industries,
    but it is also often just plain good business appealing to the pop-culture desires
    of the particular period in time. \r\n\r\n"

    way - it's here to stay - in fact it never left.\r\nDesigners are human, and like
    the rest of the population are 90% followers.\r\nDon't be sad - be glad: if you

  body: "Hey guys!\r\nWell, thank you all for sharing your opinion on this .jpg\r\n\r\nSo...
    No it is not Brawler or any other font out there, it is my Review. The image you
    see here is typed in one of the first digitized versions of it. It look a bit
    different now, but it is not finished yet. All the lines are typed in Review Regular
    (the first line is in small caps).\r\nWhy is it still in this first version and
    not in the corrected one? Well, because I'm not really active on any forum or
    blog or whatever site out there where my web site is mentioned I didn't think
    that anyone will see it, so I've left it by the time I finished the web site.
    Seems I was wrong :)  Anyway, Review was designed to be used in newspapers. It
    was my school project last year. And now, I'm trying to correct it where needed.
    Also I'm designing some other cuts of the text and some of the display version.
    \r\n\r\nP.S. Thant you Nick Cooke  :)  You are right, it was drawn with thought
    and consideration. I am sorry that you've all seen this really bad and compressed
    jpg of an early version, but still... I am glad to hear an opinion. I'll post
    you some examples when I finish it. Ok? :)"
