    reply I got:\r\n\r\n - - - - -\r\n\r\nThe pieces are all hand painted.\r\nAbout
    the font we don't know exactly. But 'Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts'
    were using this font for lots of pamphlets in the 1640's..\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n
    - - - - -\r\n\r\nso what did Thomason use?"
