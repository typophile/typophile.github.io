  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm not a &quot;designer&quot; (heaven forbid!), I'm just a person who appreciates nice fonts and decent text layouts.  That's why so far I've let other people make fonts and stuck to making the awful text layouts myself. <BR> <BR>I'm developing several largish text publications (700 pages each) which will be freely distributed over the web in PDF format (and ASCII text, and HTML, and&hellip;).  That's free as in no charge whatsoever. <BR> <BR>I know I'm batshit crazy, but I'd prefer to inflict something other than Arial, Computer Modern or Comic Sans MS on the reader.  (This is my secret strategem to slightly mitigate whatever poor typesetting skills TeX and I share.) But that pretty much means embedding fonts, since it's likely the user won't have whatever odd fonts I happen to pick.  (Well, ya know, Comic Sans is mighty tempting&hellip; and most people have it&hellip;) <BR> <BR>I had the unusual idea of purchasing a few relevant fonts instead of, say, downloading them for free from some pirate font site or buying one of those three zillion font collection CDs that are mostly copies of other people's fonts.  I'd also love to support one or more of the independent fonthouses instead of spending $$$ to make Linotype's pockets even more bloated.  I've seen some really beautiful work from independent designers in the last couple of weeks.  <BR> <BR>Initial cost isn't an issue, but the licensing is; there's no way in fraing heck I'm going to pay someone $150 a year (or the low, low price of just $.10 a download!) for the privilege of distributing a free document.  Sorry.  I may be wacky, but not that wacky. <BR> <BR>After wasting a lot of time staring at legalese-riddled EULAs and sending a few emails, my conclusion was that none of the independents are interested in my business.  That's fine.  I can just as easily give my money to AgfaMonotype/Linotype/Adobe, and I did. <BR> <BR>I firmly believe the independents are accomplishing nothing more than hurting themselves with these restrictive EULAs.  There are, obviously, two classes of font users: legitimate users and pirates.  Honest users are not going to waste their time extracting partial fonts with stripped kerning info from PDF files, they'll happily cough up the $$$ for the originals due to honesty and appreciation for the effort involved in creating a font.  Unlicensed users won't bother with this either, they'll either not use a given font or they'll get the original files from someone for free&hellip; and yes, I've held in my hot little hands illegal copies of (for example) all of Emigre's fonts, so you can't tell me this stuff isn't happening despite the prohibitions on font embedding.  In my view these EULAs are telling potential users &quot;you might as well pirate, since you may not be able to use them the way you need anyway&quot;. <BR> <BR>(I absolutely do not condone piracy and I don't own or use any pirated fonts or other software.  I'm just trying to point out the realities of the situation.) <BR> <BR>The notion of &quot;value add&quot; when it comes to distributing embedded fonts in an electronic document goes way over my head.  Electronic publishing is no different from paper publishing; while I can imagine a printed book that has all the letters in typewriter script and directions to &quot;buy a printed copy of something that looks like Bodoni (preferably ITC Bodoni but use whatever you can afford), then cut out the appropriate letters and glue them in place&quot;, that seems slightly insane.  I'm looking to buy fonts I can use&ndash;understand?  Not look at, not install on my computer and then wistfully hope someone else has them too, but *use*.  If that means embedding them in a freely distributed PDF document, so be it. <BR> <BR>My intent isn't to start a long argument/open another can of worms; the worm cans are wide open and it seems they've been crawling around loose for a while.  I'm just another luser trying to let designers know they've lost some business, and why.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I feel a need to apologize&ndash;I got a bit distracted and forgot to check back&hellip; <BR> <BR>Thanks, everyone. I've enjoyed browsing through the site and the comments here are greatly appreciated.  I was feeling a tad bit frustrated at the time I wrote my rant, but I felt the message needed to be heard.  (Perhaps all the legalese was getting to my brain. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>) <BR> <BR>Frustrated, because I was ready to spend money on entire font libraries from various publishers, but they couldn't see their way clear to allow use in free publications.  Obviously they have the right to make whatever licensing agreements they want&ndash;but I still believe they will eventually price themselves out of business this way.   <BR> <BR>While I love &quot;dead media&quot; (99.9% of the books I read are printed on paper and I have a large collection of rare books), it's crucial to recognize publishing solely in electronic form is a reality&hellip; and, with increasing display and laser printer resolution, quality fonts are becoming more important than ever.  (Bad sales pitches written for free on request. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>) <BR> <BR>I've read several rants from typophilists complaining about the heavy (ab)use of certain ugly free fonts.  I gotta wonder if some of these people are the same ones who want to charge for embedding.  Ironic?  Naw&hellip; <BR> <BR>I certainly didn't mean to slam Linotype per se&ndash;they were just the first &quot;big name&quot; that popped into my head.  Dan, I've seen <i>many</i> admirable Linotype fonts, and I agree they're a good value; I'm sure I'll end up using several Linotype fonts in my projects.  Maybe they should feel honored that I view them as a giant juggernaut crushing the competition in their path&hellip; <BR> <BR>(The only complaint I have with Linotype's offerings is a minor one&ndash;I prefer buying &quot;volume sets&quot; for a family instead of individual faces, and frequently I find Linotype doesn't have a set for the family I'm looking at.  I should probably just break down and buy a complete library.) <BR> <BR>My main reason for wanting to support some of the newer houses is to promote diversity.  For ideological reasons I prefer markets with many participants rather than a few big ones, and given a choice of where to spend money I prefer to encourage smaller companies.  New entrants seem to be popping up anyway&ndash;it's just a personal bent. <BR> <BR>What struck me as a little strange was the uniformity of the EULAs in regards to font embedding, at least for the independent houses I looked at.  I'd see the same basic wording time and time again, even down to the same exact fees.  It really made me wonder if they were honestly thinking about these issues, or they were merely going with the crowd.   <BR> <BR>I honestly expected to find a few developers explicitly advertising &quot;we allow PDF font embedding with no restrictions!&quot;.  No such luck&hellip; unless you count places such as SSI, of course.  I'm rather curious if most purchasers are aware of the embedding restrictions; actually, they probably are and just don't care. <BR> <BR>Tiffany: I'd read your excellent wiki before posting here and I pretty much agree with everything there.  While it strongly goes against my grain to see extra charges for embedding fonts in commercial contexts, I agree they should have the right to do this&ndash;and I see this as distinctly different from giving away or emailing a PDF document.   <BR> <BR>(I also find the laptop issue particularly amusing because I do all my work on one, and I'm sure the server installation issues are such a huge pain-in-the-arse in larger groups that people do it anyway.) <BR> <BR>Similar issues often come up with &quot;ordinary&quot; software, but I feel the situation is a little different with fonts because of the large number of them, and the transitory nature and contexts of their use.  While some of the EULA restrictions may make sense in isolation, in the grand scheme of things these restrictions can become a serious problem, and the usual solution is to just ignore the agreement when it becomes too inconvenient. <BR> <BR>The whole issue of commercial fonts represents a personal quandary, as I'm a dyed-in-the-wool free software supporter and developer. I worked at Cygnus Support for a few years and I fully embraced their business model, I use Linux, and it's 99.9% certain anything I produce in the future will be freely available in some form.   <BR> <BR>At the same time it doesn't bother me (much) to pay a reasonable fee for use of a font&ndash;<i>as long as I can really make use of it</i>.  What's the difference?  There's no support model for fonts.  When a user obtains a font it &quot;just works&quot;, and there's no way for a developer to make an income by providing support services.  (&quot;Pay us to tweak individual glyphs for you&quot; just doesn't sound viable. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>)  <BR> <BR>While people may occasionally request development of new fonts, I suspect relying on this income source would severely limit the size of the market.</div>

I totally understand the frustration, but I don't have a solution. <BR> <BR>I did want to mention that <a href="http://www.fountain.nu">Fountain</a> allows embedding and distribution (if I understand their EULA correctly) and they have some nice text fonts. There is a stipulation that only 60% of the font's character set can appear in a single document (or something like that). <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/designers/larsbergquist.asp">Lars Bergquist's types</a> are interesting to me, and <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/delicato.asp">Delicato</a> appears to be a great set of types complete with ligatures and ornaments. Randy Jones' Eason will be available from Fountain at some point&ndash;another good choice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that Type 1 is relatively obsolete, but it has its good points.  But from a software perspective TT/OpenType's complex format is a pain to work with, and most Postscript printers still natively use Type 1 fonts anyway.  <BR> <BR>Dan, in the thread you mentioned you were asking why many people still use Type 1.  I do because that's all my software supports, so if I purchased any OpenType fonts I'd just have to convert them to their Type 1 equivalents&hellip; so I might as well just use the Type 1 font from the start.  Another practical reason some people still use it is because some printers have support for storing font files locally on the printer, and the majority of printers in use still only support Type 1.  I've also noticed that some OpenType fonts are more expensive than their Type 1 equivalents. <BR> <BR>Getting rid of Type 1 fonts won't push people to use OpenType, it'll just be an inconvenience for those who can't use it.  For example, my X server crashes when I give it OpenType fonts&ndash;even though they're supposed to be exactly equivalent to TT.  (It's obviously a bug in the X server, but I don't feel like spending the time right now to track it down or upgrading software.) <BR> <BR>The <i>other</i> reason (let's see if I can get the formatting right <i>this</i> time <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>) people aren't rushing to switch <i>en masse</i> may be because of a perceived lack of benefits.  The only practical advantage <i>I</i> see for using OpenType is it mostly solves the glyph mapping issue&ndash;and for many (most?) people that's simply a non-issue.  That's not to say it doesn't have other advantages (it has many), but it's unlikely most of the software currently in use can take advantage of them. <BR> <BR>I also am wary of claims such as &quot;it renders 300% better!&quot;  It <i>may</i>; but I think most of us have heard these claims before. I hasten to point out that the most common way fonts are used in electronic publications (PDF/Postscript) still natively use Type 1 fonts and outlines.  (I also realize some of the OpenType benefits such as improved kerning would still apply&ndash;assuming the typesetting software can make use of it.) <BR> <BR>Hrant, I really appreciate your work in releasing a free version of Baskerville&hellip; more quality free fonts would be a really good thing, helping to save the world from the drugery of Arial Forever.  I think it makes a lot of sense to release a free core set and charge for the expert characters; it will be interesting to see how that works out&hellip; if nothing else, that approach should help to discourage pirating. <BR> <BR>Addison, thanks for the pointer.  I'm thinking about starting a webpage with links to foundries with &quot;electronic-distribution-friendly&quot; EULAs. I know they're out there, it's just a matter of knowing which ones. <BR> <BR>[Now, let's see if I can post this without the dreaded MySQL socket error&hellip; perhaps the server was trying to defend itself from one of my lengthy screeds.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">They chose it. Apparently it's a typeface that gets a lot of call among discerning TeX typographers, but the &quot;natural&quot; impediment is that they can't get it for free. I don't usually favor revivals*, but the user matters more. And anyway I actually think Baskerville is a good choice of its own in this case, since it brings some elegance to a typesetting environment that has generally lacked some aesthetic refinement, at least in its &quot;default&quot; choices, like Computer Modern. <BR> <BR>* Like I would never make a Baskerville out of blue to sell retail. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eventually there will be an article in the TUG journal treating the process fully. I hope to make the article both revealing to non-typophiles and useful for geeks like us. It's even going to have a photo of the largest Baskerville glyph in the world*: a &quot;g&quot; from the Monotype cut about three stories tall on the side of the Sherman Oaks Galleria. <BR> <BR>* That I know of. If you know of a bigger one please send a photo! <BR> <BR>What I can tell you right now though is that I spent the first month gathering samples of existing Baskervilles (which included the printing of two metal cuts at ArcheType), thinking about what it needs to be (there's not much room for play in the Roman, but my Italic will actually attempt to be more Baskerville than Baskerville's original), and getting a grasp on the structures of certain tricky characters (like reconciling the ugliness of the &quot;a&quot; against historical fidelity). Now all the setup is done and I've started rendering out some key glyphs on paper. <BR> <BR>BTW, I've also sketched out the general design of the specimen, which will actually be sort of an homage to JB's specimen sheet of 1762. I will print some with photopolymer letterpress, to accompany sales of the extensions (and to send out as shameless plugs). <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course there are. But they cost a lot more (mostly because the &quot;better type designer&quot; clause <i>does</i> apply to <i>them</i> quite well). Most notably here they generally cost too much for your typical non-profit organization, which is what TUG is. I'm sort of in a special situation where I can make fonts at the required level, but paying my bills doesn't depend on that, so I can &quot;speculate&quot; (in this case by hoping for good auxiliary retail sales) and lay foundations for my future. But I'm not the only one in such a situation. Which is why &quot;being there&quot; is so important. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
