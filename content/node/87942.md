body: I have been testing my Greek version of Froggy with assorted Greek text.  I
  have noticed that the tonos is occasionally used in a similar manner as an apostrophe.  Is
  this a common practice or is this just someones errant typing?  I kerned the tonos
  to all the glyphs in any case but am curious if this is the norm?

  body: Chris, can you provide an example? What Unicode codepoint is being used in
    this situation?

  body: Interesting. I thought the Greek apostrophe was supposed to look like the
    smooth breathing mark, which is superficially similar to the Latin apostrophe
    but with enough differences in shape, size, and position not to be mistaken for
    it. Since monotonic orthography no longer uses the smooth breathing mark, maybe
    the reasoning is that the tonos should take over the role as the template for
    what the Greek apostrophe should look like. Or it could be a lazy mistake.

  body: In most printed Greek I see these days, the Latin apostrophe is used.  Whether
    this is just a case of keyboard or glyph limitations or a conscious choice of
    the type compositor, I do not know.

  body: Chris, how did you determine what character is being used here? Can you post
    the actual text string, so I can analyse it?

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nI selected the glyph in InDesign with the Glyph palette open
    and set to \"current selection\".  When you hover your mouse over the glyph, the
    unicode pops up.\r\n\r\n\u03AC\u03C1\u03B8\u03C1\u03C9\u03BD \u03BA\u03B1\u03C4\u0384

  body: I am quite sure the user typed the glyph, I only changed the font.  My assumption
    is that this person was accustomed to typing this way as a habit. The text is
    in my previous post.

  body: "Okay, this is interesting. The 'Unicode Data' provided by InDesign is misleading,
    if that is truly associated with the sign following the tau.\r\n\r\nU+0384 is
    <em>not</em> the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT. U+0384 is the <em>spacing</em> GREEK
    TONOS character, which was encoded for backwards compatibility purposes to enable
    encoding of uppercase diacritics by entering the spacing tonos before the capital,
    e.g. \u0384E. [This encoding is not encouraged.]\r\n\r\nNow, U+0384 has a compatibility
    decomposition to 0020 0301, i.e. the space character followed by a combing acute
    accent. So it is possible that InDesign is reporting Unicode Data for this decomposition,
    which is why you are seeing it reported as COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301).\r\n\r\nAs
    to how this ended up in the text, it seems likely that some Greek users mistype
    the spacing tonos instead of the apostrophe in the same way that some English
    users type ` instead of '."
