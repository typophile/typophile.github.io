  advice so I decided to register. :)\r\n\r\nBasicly, we had to design a poster that
  would promote a pop art gallery exhibition hosted by the National Portrait Gallery,
  so I'll need your opinions on what've created.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster_6414.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  used the type Century Gothic which I think looks nice and modern. As you can see
  I played around a lot with the character kerning to give that modern feel to it.
  I decided to use the fading dots on the background these were used a lot in pop
  art. I then got a few pop art examples by famous artists from the NPG's gallery
  (http://www.npg.org.uk/popart/).\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Well..you could work on the legibility. the spaced between the words is rather
    large, compared to the very small/non-existent space between your letters. You
    should remove the the space btween the 20 & th. January is capital \"J\", and
    I guess so is the location. \r\n\r\nTry and find a proper apostrophe for st martin's
    and watch that kerning!\r\n\r\nthe design of the poster is okay overall. Nothing
    spectacular...but it works on the basic level. You could lessen the contrast of
    the purple dots in the background. I know this differs from screen to screen...so
    when you get it printed out make sure that the purple dots don't make the text
    hard to read.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n"

  body: "<cite>\xABJanuary is capital \u201CJ\u201D, and I guess so is the location.\xBB</cite>\r\n\r\nAll-lowercase
    seems to be a conscious stylistic choice here, in which case capitalisation becomes
    somewhat irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThe proper apostrophe is a must, though. So is using
    an en dash rather than a hyphen in the two cases on your poster, since they both
    indicate an interval. So, \u201C11th october 2007 \u2013 20th january 2008\u201D
    and \u201C10.00 \u2013 18.00\u201D, rather than \u201C11th october 2007 - 20th
    january 2008\u201D and \u201C10.00 - 18.00\u201D. And if you\u2019re going to
    give the dash such wide spacing as you do between the dates, you need to do the
    same between the opening and closing hours. It would be preferable to do it the
    other way around, though, and reduce the space surrounding the dash between the
    two dates. Don\u2019t remove it altogether, but rather than having a space character
    on each side of it, type it directly between \u201C2007\u201D and \u201C20th\u201D
    and add a bit of kerning (and then add similar kerning between the hours).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDid
    you consider filling the p, o, and a of \u201Cportraits\u201D with the orange
    colour used for \u201Cpop\u201D, rather than the green colour used for \u201Cart\u201D?
    That would create a somewhat more even oppositional relationship between the words,
    I\u2019d think.\r\n\r\nAnd the thing that boggles my mind most of all: why are
    you designing a poster for an exhibition that apparently ended six weeks ago?"

    the poster is not going to be used in the "real" world. :) It's just the design
    that will be looked at.

  body: "Curious, where did your color palette come from? I don't see green in any
    of the \"example\" images. \r\n\r\nAlso, you might want to consider at least 4
    different artists, the POP ART movement was pretty big, I'm sure you can find
    lots of great examples from a plethora of artists. \r\n\r\nAs for the layout,
    it seems rather stodgy and conformed. I'm assuming this is for a Design 1 class,
    Intro to Typography, or perhaps a Layout Techniques class. So, I'll also assume
    you're still learning value design skills such as hierarchy, balance and rhythm.
    Using these principles will help create focal points within your poster with clear
    movement for your eye to scan without hitting to many visual traps. As of now,
    the overall color of the poster isn't inviting, and my eye gets trapped in your
    \"negative\" cross that's formed between your images. I can't focus on the text
    as the bottom because it's formatted in a way that's difficult to read, and your
    header text is tight, using only color to determine the breaks (which gets confusing
    with the negative letter forms filled with a secondary color.)\r\n\r\nThis is
    an honest critic of what I see in your original post. I think you have room for
    improvement. Don't be discouraged, it's good to make mistakes. You learn more
    from them. "

    so the largest dots are up top, leaving more contrast for the text below?\r\nAnother
    thing I've noticed, intentional or not, is one a and i are overlapping, but the
    other is not - d(ai)ly and portr(ai)t.  It looks interesting, but it is a little
    hard to read."

  body: Personally, I don't think it works to kern the letters so close together while
    leaving the word spacing as large as it is. But I don't think the problem can
    be fixed by decreasing the word spacing. So my vote goes to not kerning the letters
    like this.
