body: 'Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Here is a new typeface I am working on. It was inspired
  by the tutorials of Computer Arts Specials &#40;Issue 39, pp. 25 and 80&#41;. As
  a neophyte in Typeshire and I was lucky enough to find this place to get some expert
  ideas and opinions. Entropy intends to be a  nice blend between art deco and contemporary
  techno style. It has similar X height as Helvetica and a deliberate minimalist design.
  When completed it will comprise at least five different weights both in normal and
  italic, and five versions with different horizontal width &#40;from narrow to super
  extended&#41;. The number 03 refers to the narrow version, 07 to the somewhat extended
  one. I also have created Russian/Cyrillic characters, because it is a good challenge.
  And a semi-serif version is also under way...  <BR>For start I would like to put
  the Entropy 03 Regular version on the balance. Please, give your opinion especially
  on the following points:   <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Originality - I have started my work
  from scratch, er... sketch, but I am deeply concerned that someone else have come
  up with a quite similar idea before. This is the main reason I publish my half-finished
  work here to claim priority or, as the case may be, to abandon the whole project.
  It is a simple design and nowadays I see more and more similar glyphs around.  Is
  there a way to check that this is an original design, or how much should it differ
  from the similar ones to merit its own existence? If you know a nearly identical
  font, please raise your hand! <BR>2&#41;  Oldstyle figures - to keep or to drop
  them? <BR>3&#41;  Any missing important glyphs necessary for regular use. Language
  accents are still in the lab. <BR>4&#41;  The name - is there any other font with
  the same name? Better name, anyone? <BR>5&#41;  Cyrillic characters - are they correct
  if you consider the design logic? <BR> <BR>All comments &#40;even beyond the four
  points above&#41; are welcomed and seriously considered. Thanks,  <BR> <BR> <BR>Tybor

  body: 'Very nice!!! Reserve me a copy! <BR> <BR>A few nitpicky things: it would
    be nice to see a little more divergence between Latin and Cyrillic letters &#40;the
    Ks, Es, Ms, etc&#41;. I&#39;m no expert, but I do love the inclusion of Cyrillic
    here. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also be curious to see blocks of Latin and Cyrillic text
    side-by-side; your Cyrillic lowercase letters might look smaller than the Latin
    and need optical adjustment &#40;enlargement&#41;. <BR> <BR>Your percent and per-thousand
    might look better with circles or forward-o&#39;s. The euro sign might look better
    a bit wider. <BR> <BR>Paul'

  body: 'Tibor, <BR>I like it.  The overall weight is nice. I like the marriage between
    calssical deco style with a modern techinical feel.  <BR>The name is cool, lots
    of conceptual meaning.  Unfortunetly, it is also the name of a font designed by
    Stephen Farrell &#40;Sold at T-26&#41;.  '

- body: When you say you are concerned about its originality, do you mean the letterforms?
    Combining the angle with the curved edge is not really &#34;original&#34; because
    it seems like a popular trend nowadays, especially in web design &#40;borders,
    moreso than letters.&#41;  At the same time, I&#39;m not sure type designers need
    to really worry about being original. &#40;But maybe moreso here, if you are intending
    this to be mostly a display face?&#41; <BR>I really like how the lowercase letters
    come to an abrubt stop at the tops, it seems like that is an identifying feature
    of this typeface that sets it apart from other techno-like faces. &#40;?&#41;
    <BR>I really like old style figures in sans serif faces. Do the 3 and 5 &#40;osf&#41;
    seem too open? The 2 and 3 don&#39;t fit perfectly. Maybe if they were cheated
    slightly thinner? Dunno. <BR>And randomly, are you from Hungary? =&#41; <BR>

  body: Tibor -- I think it&#39;s beautiful, but something about the lowercase &#34;k&#34;
    and &#34;s&#34; don&#39;t quite feel right. Great work so far!
