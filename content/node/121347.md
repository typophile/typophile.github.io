  body: Don't know it but as it should date from the pre-digital area, probably custom.
    /S reminds me a lot of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Serpentine|Sepentine]]
    and I guess starting from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/serpentine-sans|Serpentine
    Sans]] might even quicker to reproduce it.

  body: "The extra width of the retro livery lettering compared to the 1968 wordmark
    may be due, at least in part, to the result of the letters being on a surface
    that curves away from the viewer.\r\nDon"
