  typefaces being used for signage/wayfinding? I'm wondering what the pros/cons are
  of using a rounded typeface.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Why not?\r\n\r\nFF Info is a rounded (or roundish) sans designed for wayfinding.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to Erik Spiekermann, the rounded corners can save a lot of time in plotting and
    weeding the vinyl when manufacturing a large number of signs. "

  body: Yeah, definitely. I just imagined with all the testing and research that goes
    into way finding typefaces there surely would be some commentary on rounded typefaces
    in signage. Seems like there are successful typefaces for way-finding both rounded
    and not.

  body: "Since vinyl plotters slow down around curves, I'm not sure how you could
    save time plotting a font with rounded corners. \r\n\r\nWeeding is different though,
    it would probably be easier there. "

  body: "<cite> I just imagined with all the testing and research that goes into way
    finding typefaces there surely would be some commentary on rounded typefaces in
    signage.</cite>\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know studies which researched such a specific
    design feature. In my opinion: It simply isn\u2019t a relevant factor. Letter
    skeleton, stroke width, letter-spacing and of course type size are so much more
    important. So I would say it\u2019s more a matter of stylistic freedom to pick
    a rounded font or not. \r\n\r\nI am also not clear about how much roundness you
    are thinking about. Something like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/din-next-rounded/refby=opentype\">DIN
    Rounded</a>? Or just rounded corners as in FF Info or Wayfinding Sans?\r\nIf it\u2019s
    extreme as in DIN Rounded, I would say it slightly decreases legibility, because
    you remove information from the stroke ends. They are more \u201Cfuzzy\u201D and
    not as articulated as they could be. But like I said: that\u2019s a minor effect
    and can easily be compensated. "

  body: "My nephew works in a sign shop. I just texted him and he says their vinyl
    cutting equipment can handle any font without problems, and the speed seems around
    the same to him.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was different in the past. Talk to the company
    making your signs.\r\n\r\nI'd think that readability is the main factor if it
    needs to be read from a distance or from a moving vehicle. A full size mockup,
    when practical, is good for testing purposes."

  body: I've seen my type family Chevin used as the wayfinding family for the Spitalfields
    area of London. It looked very clear and readable, and pretty good to me. (Well,
    it would of course).

  body: "I guess I would say that there are other features of a sans serif other than
    whether or not it is rounded that make it better or worse for wayfinding. Rounding
    probably hurts a bit, but I expect that the difference between say Helvetica and
    Frutiger is still much greater than that between Helvetica and Helvetica Rounded.\r\n\r\n(Actually,
    in the case of Helvetica, the rounding might help, as it slightly opens the nearly-closed
    apertures that are the big problem of Helvetica.)"

  body: "There are situations where research does go into the selection of typefaces
    for signage. Thus, we have the special typefaces used for highway signage in the
    United States - because legibility, even under the poorest conditions, will save
    lives.\r\n\r\nIn other circumstances, though, the choice of typeface is left up
    to individuals who make their choices based on aesthetics and the image they wish
    to project.\r\n\r\nThus, Helvetica Medium has been treated as the ideal typeface
    for certain kinds of signage - subway stations, airline terminals, and the like
    - modern, efficient, inoffensive.\r\n\r\nUnless there are critical legibility
    concerns, therefore, if you happen to like a particular rounded sans-serif typeface,
    go for it."

  body: 'I''m designing one, actually. I do want it rounded to some extent as it''s
    based off hand-painted letters that include rounding, but I''m deciding whether
    it should be rounded to the extent of DIN Rounded or [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/tondo/|Tondo]],
    or just rounded corners like Wayfinding Sans (which is a big inspiration). I know
    I will not reach the functionality of mentioned fonts but I am having fun learning.
    Thanks for the helpful discussion. '

  body: Make a full size sign with both rounded and unrounded designs for the legends.
    Get 5 friends together and walk back well past the intended viewing distance.
    See what happens.
