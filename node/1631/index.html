  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">All the legal issues guru's here, could you please advise me on a following question: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I live in a tiny country with it's own language that has several letters in its alphabet that have accented characters which you don't get in a standart font (with macrons, mitigations (is it a term?) et al).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, in order to use a font I have bought from a foundry (assuming that it is not one of the few already adapted fonts distributed by our only local foundry) I have to open it up in Fontographer, edit the letters - add the missing parts and place them in the right places in the character table to work with our standard keyboard - and export the font. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question arises when a pal/friend/colleague of mine wants to get the same font. What would be the right way to arrange it so that he would not have to do the job I've already done (ie open-&gt;edit-&gt;export-&gt;use), but still would own the font legally? Is it legal that he buys a copy from the foundry and then pays me to edit it and I give him the edited version I already have?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah. We're all really lawyers.  ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maija, like Tiffany said it depends on the particular font house, so be sure to ask them*. MS is the only one I know of that prevents any modifications for any purpose, but most font houses are happy if everybody using the font in any form has paid once for it. Some small foundries (like Tankard for example) try to insist on doing all modifications themselves, but to me that sort of thing is more of a personal decision on your part rather than &quot;professionalism&quot; or something. The more you support type designers the better for type in the long term, but you have to worry about yourself too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* On the other hand, if you feel their position is unreasonable (not to yourself, but in the overall), I personally advise taking things into your own hands.

		<div class="commentbody">You're right, Simon - I guess my defence is that I have more interesting things to read! On the other hand, a while back MS* was indeed the only one to prohibit any mods outright, no? But you're right, of the first three EULAs in that Google result, Bilak's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to allow &quot;internal modification&quot; (it's really ambiguous, maybe on purpose), while the other two don't. I think the latter stance is stupid, because all it does is reduce trust between seller and buyer. Telling people they can't do something they'll do anyway can only serve to reduce your authority. It's much better to look the other way, and follow the other road you mention: &quot;Those that allow modification require that the recipient be a licensee of the original font.&quot; And when anybody asks me, I'll advise against buying fonts from such a control-freak font house: if you have to go to the original designer for an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->internal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mod on something you've paid for**, you're opening yourself up for delays and extortion. And a font house that gains one extra commission by forcing the modification to revent to it is losing more than one commission by tricking the customer (with an unexpected clause in the EULA) into buying something with hidden fees. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Which you could say was a special case, since OS functionality was involved. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->** To me the difference between buying and licensing is just legalistic trickery. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have mixed opinions about this. On the one hand, I expect to be able to approach a foundry and say &quot;hey, I really need to add East European support to one of your fonts I've already licensed; you already own all modified versions by virtue of their being derivative works, so you can sell my results to a new market and claim all resulting profits.&quot; In some cases this may prove a good idea; in others, I can see how a foundry would not want to keep track of which characters are available in all the third-party-modified fonts that result, to say nothing of quality control or phone support in God Knows What Language. Then there's the matter of getting phone calls from service bureaux cos this or that third-party version of this or that font is clogging a RIP.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Expanded character set support is nice to have and will be much easier to implement because of things like FontLab and OpenType. But you have to respect the costs that foundries have to bear once such modifications are introduced. I would encourage you to keep such considerations in mind when approaching a foundry about modifying their fonts, and think of ways to make it easier for them. I wish this were simpler, but it's not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When foundries start paying for the right to license formats I'll start paying attention to the claims they make against modifying fonts I have &quot;licensed&quot; from them.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fontographer never got the rights to allow modification of certain Microsoft TrueType fonts that contain a certain kind of kerning, since they could not provide support for this. One would think that they must have secured rights from other major suppliers of formating to allow their own software to be used by their customers without concern for liability. So it you modify via Fontographer, and I assume FontLab, there must have been certain rights secured that circumvent any claims additionally made by piggie-back foundries?</div>
