body: "All, \r\n\r\nI am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at
  the University of Illinois. I am interested in studying the use of online discussion
  forums for critique and how they can be improved. I have a short (11 question) survey
  and I would like to invite you to complete and return it to me. \r\n\r\nThe survey
  contains background questions about the value and role of critique and ends with
  specific questions about the use of technology. It would be most helpful if you
  could focus on assessing the use of forums such as this one in forming your response
  to the technology-specific questions. The data will be kept confidential and only
  ever presentd in aggregate form. I would appreciate hearing about your experiences
  and learning from them. My return email address is in the survey. \r\n\r\nSurvey

  \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for considering, \r\n-Brian Bailey"
