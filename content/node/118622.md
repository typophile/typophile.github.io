  quick answers - then again, I might not be using the right terminology to search...\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to figure out how to do something with long lists of names in donor / annual
  reports. Say one of the list entries is very long and is going to take up several
  lines. How do I make all the lines after first line of that entry tab over a certain
  amount? \r\n\r\nMy apologies - the explanation is probably lacking. Any help would
  be greatly appreciated and obviously be a huge time saver. Thanks!"

  body: "Using what software? That is quite relevant ...\r\n\r\nBy the way, the term
    you are looking for is \"hanging indent\". Some software systems, such as Adobe
    InDesign and CSS (for HTML formatting) fake it by specifying a left indent on
    a full paragraph, and set the \"first line\" indent to the same distance, but
    negated."

  body: "Anne, the technique is fairy simple, using the Type > Tabs dialogue in InDesign.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a visual aid, using InDesign 6.0 and an actual annual report listing:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tab_one_5012.png]\r\n\r\nSimply
    move the left margin guide in the Tabs window over as far as you want the indent,
    then pull just the top of the split arrow back all the way to the left--this makes
    the first line flush with the left margin and any overflow indented to the point
    you chose. Add a tab at the indent point if you like (though it isn't necessary,
    it can be an aid if you decide to manually indent lines).\r\n\r\nIf you haven't
    already created a style for your listing, you can set the tab as described above
    and then create a new style that incorporates it. If the style is already established,
    edit the style and add the tab setting to it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tab_two_6021.png]"

  body: "With InDesign there are often several ways to do something. \r\n\r\nI usually
    use indents. (I use picas, but obviously you could use whatever measurement system
    you prefer.) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/style-sheets-3_5493.jpg]"

  body: "Gentleman, using the split margin tool in tabs is merely a more visual way
    to set the left and first line indents, and has the added bonus of showing the
    results in real time.\r\n\r\nFor Photoshop users, the Indents and Spacing dialogue
    may be more familiar and natural. For an old analog guy such as myself, I prefer
    the tab dialogue. To each his own."

  body: "> showing the results in real time\r\n\r\nI know what you mean, you can see
    it visually on the Tabs bar, but you can also see results immediately in the actual
    text using indents (if you click the Preview checkbox in Paragraph Styles).\r\n\r\n>
    For Photoshop users, the Indents and Spacing \r\n> dialogue may be more familiar\r\n\r\nYes
    I agree. I typically use it in Photoshop if I need bullets hanging left of the
    text margin.\r\n\r\n> To each his own\r\n\r\nExactly. Either way works, use the
    method you prefer."
