  or sometimes script type called? \r\n\r\nI have looked everywhere possible and I
  haven't been able to find an answer. I feel like I should know what they are called
  and even though I am no novice to design I am at a loss. Ultimate brain fart of
  the century. Feel free to point your finger and laugh. \r\n\r\n-Thanks"

  body: Perhaps those were their original definitions, Chris. Lately I see them all
    used interchangeably and I'm not really opposed to it.

    is no-longer a word mark or even an acronym but any and all \"Deely Things\" used
    as identifiers for businesses or entities.\r\n\r\nI guess we are all trying to
    be \"good men of taste and discernment,\" :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
