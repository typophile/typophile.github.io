    Insignia without the extended crossbars could be Bonn.</a>"

  body: Interesting, Florian. I haven't run into Bonn before. So, you think this could
    be Bonn? Or just Insignia modified to look like Bonn?

  body: "Yes, I think this could be Bonn. The typeface was originally designed for
    the <a href=\"http://www.kah-bonn.de/index.htm\">KAH Bonn</a>, but has also been
    employed by Neville Brody for his redesign of the ORF identity (Austrian Broadcasting
    Corporation). Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able to track down a full specimen
    of Bonn. Maybe Paul Stonier can help?"

  body: Oh, so you think it may have been an exclusive at one point, but no more?
    If it is the apparently obscure Bonn I'd love to know how NBC (or whoever does
    their graphics) came to be using it?

    German language.\r\n\r\nKUNST UND AUSSTELLUNGSHALLE DER BUNDESREPUBLIK DEUTSCHLAND\r\n\r\nWow!
    English can't even come close to such grand expressiveness. Even if it wasn't
    in all-caps. :)\r\n\r\nAnd nice to see they're holding an exhibition on James
    Cook travellin' down my way."

    from Google Alerts because you used my name.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scr_6275.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot
    sure on the exclusivity status of the font. I believe it is still under ORF."

    it. Google Alerts to the rescue! Thank you for chiming in, and confirming.\r\nAs
    you seem to have access to Bonn, could you post a full sample of this typeface,
    showing the UC and lc alphabet plus figures, please? That would be very helpful
    for future IDs. Thanks!"

  body: In the post you mentioned above, I posted the majority of the characters.
    It's a caps only face, but I can cook something up that should show it a little
    better.
