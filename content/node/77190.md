    the swash on the bottom left of the i. \r\n\r\nThis is purely a remark on how
    it could look 'kool' as I have no idea what it could be for, the genre, its characteristics,
    whether its selling something etc."

  body: "On first viewing I like it! Good sense of movement, but not boy-racer speed...\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    I think it might lose some legibility at smaller sizes - the 'k' and 't' are a
    bit too similar. Maybe you could give 't' a medium ascender height?"
