body: Has anybody used [[Jim Spiece]]'s revival of [[William Addison Dwiggins|Dwiggins]]'
  [[Winchester]]? Is it as good, as a design and as a revival, as one would hope?
  I'm surprised I haven't come across more excitement about it, since it ought to
  be the most characterful digital Dwiggins on the market, and it's obviously a real
  book weight.

    kaput. I will look for it and scan.

  body: "It has been regularized and none of the lovely quirks which rightly belong
    in it are there. Most glaringly it is missing the uncial forms. (Please, if I'm
    wrong post a link. Myfonts does not show these glyphs.) Granted it probably wouldn't
    be as commercial, but it isn't a proper revival without those forms. It isn't
    as warm or friendly either.\r\n\r\nDwiggins theorized that the \"Roman\" alphabet
    was developed for Latin and then the Romance languages, and so, when reading those
    language the \"Roman\" alphabet suited it very well. However, when it came to
    English, the alphabet didn't quite work. This is where the uncial forms help.
    Or so Dwiggins thought. I don't agree. I find the uncial G in his setting disturbing.
    But, by jiggity, he put the uncial forms in there so why aren't they there?\r\n\r\nIf
    you are lucky enough to get your hands on the \"Postscripts on Dwiggins\" Chapbook
    set, it has it in there in all of its glory."

  body: Stephen  might beat me to it, but I will post a sample of Dwiggin's Winchester
    on Monday. If you look at the typeface on Myfonts, really look at the letters,
    especially the italic. Some of the "corrections" are very obvious. I would love
    to know why the name was kept but not the character.

  body: Thanks Tiffany; from the preview, the fonts do look a bit coarser than I'd
    expect (though g is beautifully modelled)), and the d which Tracy complains about
    seems to have been so neutered as actually to look out of place because too dully
    Transitional.
