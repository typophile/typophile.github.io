<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Ok. I have had ZERO replies from the Apple forums. Calling Sonnet Tech was absolutely useless. Equally useless was calling MacMall's tech support. So, I turn to you, my fellow typophiles, because I trust that you might have an answer that rings a little more clear for a tech-newb like myself. I hope no one minds this non-typographic topic.
Recently I upgraded my AGP G4 400 with an Encore/ST G4 1.2 GHz processor and an ATI Radeon 9000 Video Card. I also happened to upgrade to CS2, but I really doubt this could be a problem.
Shortly after doing all three of these upgrades my machine starting crashing. Two specific kinds of crashes. Total lock-up plus the polyglot screen and total lock-up full-stop. I didn't keep a log so I can't say with total certainty , but, it almost always happened when saving for web in Illustrator while enlarging the image or after enlarging and saving.
I want to guess that it is some sort of heat issue as my computer, while it did spiral to crash rather quickly, seemed to get worse over time. How many apps I have opened didn't seem to make it better or worse.
Does any of this sound familiar or feasible to anyone? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry Tiff. I have never come across your problem. I have had weirdness with CS2 though. In Illustrator, the keyboard commands (command spacebar or command option spacebar) quit working. Quitting AI and reopening it cures it. A friend of mine who had moved fonts around as suggested by Suitcase had CS2 die and crash on him. He ended up trashing fonts and reinstalling system from scratch to resolve it. I would say that you should try to isolate your problem. First, go back to CS1 and see if that cures it. If not, swap back your old processor. A pain in the Tuchas, I know.
Sorry I can't be of much help. I just felt you needed at least some human response to your cry for help (and you are "Special") :-)

<div class=commentbody>This does sound like a hardware problem, but it's not necessarily a serious one. If you installed the Sonnet card yourself, you might try opening up your computer and firmly pressing down all its connections (but not <em>too</em> firmly, you know what I mean). Same goes for the Radeon. Whenever you put in a new CPU, or RAM, or anything else with an edge connector, it's possible for components to shift position slightly as they heat up, and then they'll wiggle out of their sockets and start getting flaky.
If that doesn't work, you can try pulling the CPU upgrade and graphics card and putting them back in, just to make sure the connections are all tight. The technical term for this is "getting out of the car and getting back in again". Sadly, unlike in a real car, sometimes this fixes the problem.
If <em>that</em> doesn't work, and you still haven't pitched your computer out the window (which I don't recommend, as that's not likely to fix the problem), then you can try only having one of the new components installed at a time (assuming you held onto your old CPU and graphics card) and see if you can isolate which is causing the problem.
Also, if you're running Tiger, make sure you upgrade to 10.4.1. It has updated ATI and nVidia drivers, which may or may not make a difference with your card.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Chris and Forrest, for replying.
Chris, I had the hairbrained idea that it might be font related. One of the places that I could predictably crash/lock-up was "saving for web" in Illustrator. But, only if I enlarged it within "save for web" would it lock-up.
Forrest, we did try "getting out of the car and getting back in again." Great analogy. I didn't want to throw the CPU out, but I was tempted to shot-put the processor upgrade after taking it out.
I am back running the 400MHz and am totally stable. Isn't this pretty much a guarantee that it is the processor with the problem? </div>

<div class=commentbody>I would recommend returning the upgrade and getting a mac mini. It'll only set you back a couple hundred more, and It'll be much quicker. Old hardware has more bottlenecks than just processor speed. I upgraded my beige g3 to g4 back in the day. By the time I got done buying piece after piece I had bought a new ATA controller, a new video card, a new processor, a usb card, a 100mbit ethernet card and more. I finally ran out of pci slots. If I had sold the old machine and put down another couple hundred I could have had a shiny new graphite g4 (with a faster bus and new world ROM).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have no idea of what kind of trouble you are going trough Tiff, but if I could help you I would be very pleased to do so, I have experimented myself some frustrating crash downs. However I can´t stop thinking how easier and cheaper would be to fix this problem from a PC.

<div class=commentbody>Hector, that is very nice of you. My IT guy said the same exact thing. I now understand why it is easier to buy the machine you intend to use instead of trying to manipulate and/or upgrade to the machine you want.
I am half thinking about looking at the OWC processors as a friend of mine had complete success with her upgrade. The OWC comes with the added bonus of being able to manipulate the jumpers. But, this is down the road. G5s are so inexpensive, relative to my situation, that I might just wait for my boss to get a clue. </div>

<div class=commentbody>(If I keep the discussion about hardware & avoid talking OS's, will it still degenerate into a holy war?)
Hector and Tiff, the big difference between Macs and PCs are that Macs are designed as a closed system and PCs are an open system. PC users are allowed to pick their processor, their motherboard, their video card and their sound card. All these components have to be compatible, so a system of standards are in place to ensure that. The good news is that open systems promote competition and drive down prices. The bad news is that the standards are always written for yesterday's components. Apple computers, however, aren't really designed to be upgraded: apple does everything in-house, and sets their own standards. The bad news about this is that there is no competition, so the prices remain high. The good news is that Apple is not shackeled by outdated standards, and dump any that are getting in the way. This allows them to design a system who's components are maximized for working synergistically. The bad news is that this synergysm does not allow for easy upgrades. Tiff, it sounds like your new processor is 4x faster than your old one? If the sewer pipes in your home were optimized to carry all your wastewater -- all you used and no more -- imagine what would happen if you suddenly started flushing your toilet 4 times more often. (Sorry about that metaphor: I've been drinking coffee all morning.)
There are benefits to both systems; I'm not advocating one or the other. There is room on the road for custom hot rods, stock Porches, station wagons and buses. You just have to remember to avoid putting 35 people into a Porche.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, for upgrades, I'd recommend leasing your hardware. Then you get a new machine every 2 or 3 years, rather than the dilemma of upgrading or replacing every 2 to 3 years. We just made that policy here and it seems to be a lot more scalable, rather than having 3 year old PowerBooks that we feel stuck with.
There may be some tax benefits that will help convince your employer. =)
Also, for upgrading OS and software, I like to wait until the .1 or .2 release (rather than a .0 release.)

<div class=commentbody>Jay, I'd fully agree about the open versus closed platform. But I do not agree in the slightest when it comes to price.
Consider the fastest 15" PowerBook you can buy, with all the available upgrades:
PowerBook 15" with 1.67 GHz G4 Processor
2GB RAM
128MB Video RAM
100GB Hard Drive
Super Drive (CD-R/DVD-R)
Wireless Card (standard)
Bluetooth (standard)
<strong>Total Price = $3,200</strong>
A similarly equipped quality machine costs more by the time you put in what Apple ships standard.
IBM Thinkpad 14.1" with 2 GHz Mobile Centrino Processor
14.1" screen
2GB RAM
128MB Video RAM
80GB Hard Drive
Wireless G Card
Bluetooth card
Super Drive (CD-R/DVD-R)
<strong>Total Price = $3,400</strong>

<div class=commentbody>Joe, you're preaching to the converted. I've never owned a non-mac computer. I was trying to not show my prejudice. :0)
Although your figures, I'm sure, are true, Apple tends to loose out on the advertised "base model" price, because it insists on shipping a full system.
Truth be told, I've never minded paying for quality. In somthing approaching 20 years, I've had one (1) floppy drive fail on me, and the latch mechanism of my current laptop is fubar ... and that is my total history of hardware failure using Macs. I did upgrade a SE/30 once, and that machine became a bit cranky ... and that was when I developed my "no upgrade" policy. It never failed, mind you, but it just didn't seem happy.
I blather. This is way off topic. 'Night, all.</div>
