body: "Hello. I'm putting this project up here for some critique. It is a logo design
  for a pro audio manufacturer start-up: Longhurst. The various products (pre-amps,
  compressors, tape-delays) will have names such as \"Superburst,\" \"Sunburst,\"
  etc. The company will be positioned as a small boutique manufacturer with unique
  sounds. Aesthetically, we're looking for something slightly nostalgic, but also
  fresh and solid.\r\n\r\nThe first two options use u&lc type, which is how I often
  approach logos. But something made me decide to try some custom lettering, and after
  a few different attempts, I settled on the blocky all-caps look of the lower four
  options. (Also came up with a whole lot of \"bursts!\" and tried to integrate them
  somehow.)\r\n\r\nSo I'd be happy if you could spare a minute to let me know what
  you think... "

  body: "1 & 2 remind me of the logos on boxes of lawn grass seed where as I can picture
    the others screenprinted on a effects box or moulded in chrome-painted black plastic
    on an amp. The  retro block lettering suits the products. I think you need to
    make the leg of R a lot heavier, and the counters in B closer to the centre, the
    way R's counter is. I'd like to see 5 all in black with those adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe
    bursts are perhaps a bit too ornate to work with the lettering. I think the third
    is best and that should be filling the space in the bottom right at optically
    the same height as the letters.\r\n"

  body: Thanks, Justin. I agree with most of what you're saying. I'll work on some
    more options.

    has a more top-heavy B, closer in style and size to the R.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LSB_Ideas02_5567.png]\r\n"
