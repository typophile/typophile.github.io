    in helping them... <BR> <BR>Nah, I&#39;m not <i>really</i> mad. I might&#39;ve
    helped other  <BR>people with it

    at the top of the page? <BR> <BR>&#34;A bit annoyed&#34; is more like it. I&#39;m
    sorry about that <BR>because I&#39;d rather be the friendly moderator, not  <BR>the

  body: AAA Troubleman... I humbly apologize... <BR>As you can tell from my number
    of posts I&#39;m a total amatuer here at typophile... <BR>But extremely helpful
    experts like yourself are the reason I came here in the first place... <BR> <BR>and
    besides - just because I didn&#39;t realized you had helped me so much with a
    full tutorial - I did notice that you &#40;and others&#41; have referred back
    to it numerous times - so see if I hadn&#39;t have asked for it you wouldn&#39;t
    have been able to help sooo many other folks! haha <BR> <BR>But seriously - thanks
    a lot - I know you&#39;ve helped me several times...so you&#39;re my font hero
    Troubleman! lol <BR> <BR>Later  <BR>The Danger <BR> <BR>&#43;know the freedom&#43;
