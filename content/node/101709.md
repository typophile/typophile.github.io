  body: "You are basically right Jan, it could perfectly be <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Berthold&ffam=Akzidenz-Grotesk%20BQ%20-%20Medium&fid=a05e72957b7c00d0f15d20fb63688f19&fsize=48&text=Lotta%20Elstad%20Ettromsleiligheten&wrap=2|Akzidenz
    Grotesk (Medium)]]</strong>.\r\nThe only difference I notice is that Gothic 725
    Bold is a bit lighter and more narrow (condensed) which makes it somewhat closer
    to the sample image.\r\n"
