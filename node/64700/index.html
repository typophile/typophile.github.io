  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone,

Brief is for a draftsman and interior design company combined- must be simple fresh and modern. They wanted to avoid "house" type logo's.
Here is the bw version- the colour version is white on blue happy to post if interested.
I have also done another version of all of these logos incorporating (at lower opacity a blueprint)...but i am going to try and convince them that it would be best suited for website or etc.
These are rough ideas so far....please help I'm going crazy. 

TIA,

Maree.

Well, in my humble opinion: none of them.
And this is for a simple reason: the briefing is too simple.

- What kind of target-clients are they seeking?
- Which are the idiosyncrasies of their work? Do they have a particular style?
- Why would they want to redesign their brand?
- Which kind of people would seek your client's services?

When you and your client are not happy with anything, start fresh. And remember: do not show your client anything that you dislike. ;)

Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">in avoiding the "house type logos" can I ask why you've decided to focus on the drafting/blueprint approach? That seems pretty housey to me.


in some of the option spresented I can't work out if it's IRW or LRW.
what do the letters stand for? do lrw and 'designs' need to be given the same amount of focus? I think it would be a lot more flexible concentrating on the interplay of LRW and dealing with the 'designs' bit later<br />

that's my 2 cent invoice anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone appreciate all your comments...and I'm feeling a bit better this morning!

Lula- thanks but I have all that info in 2 pages of copious notes on exactly those questions and more when I met them..I didn't think I needed to type it all out here. 

Mark- yes I see it now- its called delerium and desparation :)

Geeza- thanks will have a play with that.

Ratbaggy- in saying avoiding house logos I actually meant a physical house symbol...they actually want to do more residential work- i tried a key type reference(where the "i" is) I tried a doorknob motif somewhere...I just don't know. The clients wanted a blueprint blue- etc because they pride themselves on their superior documentation. 
It's actually L.R.W (initials) I tried some designs that way but client had a strong preference (before i even started designing- they havent seen anything yet) for lowercase which in terms of consistency of their branding/website etc I can see their point. I did try playing with the lrw bit but everything looked old school and not modern- or TOO modern....but you've got me thinking will try some more tonight. Thanks so much.

M.

Great! Now, forget all the formal hints. Even the house-like interdiction.
Blueprints, for instance, are a reference from technical designers to technical designers, this may truncate the type of clients their image attracts.

Frankly, what I mean is: if you can't use "house" as a concept/figuration, what will you use instead? You've presented many concepts, one proposal for each.

Sorry for my bad english, hope this helps!

Cheers!</div>
