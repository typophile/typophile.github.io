  an illustration I hope to commission. This will be for silkscreened apparel. I would
  like to have the same Spencerian style one sees applied to birds, fruit, feathers,
  etc. applied to a more modern subject such as a tank, bomber, grenade, etc. The
  effect is intended to be ironic\u2026a beautifully human and fragile depiction of
  an instrument of death.\r\n\r\nI am attaching an image to give you some idea of
  what I hope to emulate. It is a meager example of the craft, but all I have currently
  available.\r\n\r\n"

  body: you might want to contact the guys at [[House Industries]] or [[Mark Simonson]].
    Otherwise, you might try looking for a local calligrapher's society?

    (the technique that is ) a slight edginess that the other designer here seem not
    to have. Of course, I forgot the link or his name.\r\n\r\nBut I saved one his

    an e-mail link for him on this page. My Mother took classes with him, and I can
    attest to the fact that he is amazing...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spencerian.com/\r\n\r\n*EDIT:
    the sample you have provided was done by Elvis Swift (or at least it exactly duplicates
    his style). Link below. A true spencerian ornament will be much more elegant,
    and not as bold and graphic. So you may not want a true Spencerian treatment if
    you're wanting to match your sample...\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://altpick.com/members.php?id=17873\">Elvis

  body: Thank you all for your suggestions! I appreciate your help. Oh...and I am
    wanting a true Spencerian ornament. The example I found was the best I could find
    to convey the proper idea. What I am looking for is more delicate, whimsical,
    hand crafted.
