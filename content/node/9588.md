body: I&#39;ve been drawing letters in Illustrator for a while and I&#39;m ready to
  take the plunge and buy TypeTool 2 &#40;I&#39;d get Fontlab if I could afford it&#41;.  Anybody
  know where the cheapest place to get it?  Go straight to the source and buy it from
  Papurys?  I was also considering getting an old issue of Computer Arts that comes
  with the full version 1.3 and then update this for $39.95 instead of paying $99.  But
  it seems to be hassle, and maybe not worth it.  Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanks!
  <BR> <BR>P.S. I&#39;m out of school, but I&#39;m not working yet.  So I don&#39;t
  qualify for a academic price either.

    issue 96 &#40;February 2005&#41;, fly to France and buy &#34;Computer Arts&#34;
    issue 74 &#40;January 2005&#41; or get last year&#39;s UK editions of Computer
    Arts issue 95 or Computer Arts Projects issue 57. They all have TypeTool 1.3 bundled
    for free. Then update to TypeTool 2 for $39.95.  <BR> <BR>If you can get a cheap
    flight to Rome or Paris for less than $40, you&#39;d get away cheaper or at least
    not more expensive, plus be able to add a weekend in Paris or Rome ;&#41;  <BR>

  body: Lauri <BR>However you get Type Tool 2, and if it includes a flight to Rome
    or Paris, great, I personally think you will like it. I use it and, now that Fontographer
    is no longer supported by the parent company, i.e., updated, most use either FontLab
    or Type Tool 2.

  body: Jordan, thanks for the recommendation!  I&#39;ll probably get Typetool 2 tonight
    from fontlab. <BR> <BR>Adam, when I said cheap I didn&#39;t mean in any way that
    I don&#39;t appreciate the Fontlab company.  I think they&#39;re/you&#39;re great!  I&#39;m
    just used to shopping around online &#40;I use Amazon every month&#41;, and usually
    use Pricegrabber.com for finding the best prices for products.  I didn&#39;t get
    any hits at all with that for Typetool so I&#39;d thought I&#39;d ask around here.  I
    already ordered Cabarga&#39;s Fontlab/Typetool book, so I&#39;m ready to roll
    when I purchase the software.  When it comes to Computer Arts, I&#39;ve seen several
    Typophile posts mentioning it. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    a typography class is when I was crashing classes &#40;trying to register for
    a class after the semester had started if there was any available seats&#41; at
    my university... So I went to the class and I saw the professor &#40;from behind&#41;
    sitting at a desk helping a student, and I go: &#34;Excuse me sir, I was wondering
    if there&#39;s any seats available in the class?&#34; and the professor turns
    around and it&#39;s a woman.  I was totally fooled by her clothes and short hair.  I
    was so embarrased... and if there were any seats available they probably wouldn&#39;t
    have been available for me.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Adam, <BR> <BR>A quick question.  According to the TypeTool 2 page at FontLab
    &#40;<a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/TypeTool/" target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/TypeTool/</a>&#41;
    you can export TrueType-based OpenType fonts.  But when I try to generate an OpenType
    font I can&#39;t find the option at all in the drop-down box.  Am I missing something?
    <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: 'Lauri,  <BR> <BR>The terms &#34;TrueType fonts&#34; and &#34;TrueType-based
    OpenType fonts&#34; can be used interchangably.  <BR> <BR>Each &#34;TrueType&#34;
    font generated by FontLab 4.6 or TypeTool 2 is automatically an OpenType TT fonts.
    This is why in our new series of applications, starting with TransType Pro, we&#39;ll
    be consistently using the terms:  <BR>&#42; &#34;OpenType PS&#34; for PostScript-based
    OT fonts &#40;.otf&#41; <BR>&#42; &#34;TrueType / OpenType TT&#34; for TrueType-based
    OT fonts &#40;.ttf&#41; <BR> <BR>In our existing applications, we&#39;re using
    the terms &#34;TrueType&#34; for &#34;TrueType / OpenType TT&#34; and &#34;OpenType&#34;
    or &#34;OpenType-CFF&#34; for &#34;OpenType PS&#34;. Sorry for the confusion.  <BR>
    <BR>Microsoft Windows displays the green &#34;O&#34; icon for all fonts with the
    .otf extension and for those fonts with the .ttf extension that have a digital
    signature. So to have a green &#34;O&#34; icon in .ttf fonts generated by TypeTool
    2 or FontLab 4.6, you need to digitally sign your font:  <BR><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/afdko/topic_digital_sig_guide.html"
    target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/afdko/topic_digital_sig_guide.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>You can get a &#34;code signing&#34; / &#34;Authenticode&#34; digital
    signature from Verisign or Thawte &#40;the latter is cheaper&#41;, but unfortunately,
    none of them is free.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam'

  body: Adam, <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot for an excellent description! <BR> <BR>Yeah, I
    was looking for the green &#34;O&#34; icon in Windows XP.  Besides from the &#34;O&#34;,
    when you double-click on a font in Windows XP you get the built in font-viewer
    and on a test font I generated in TypeTool it says &#40;TrueType&#41; after the
    name of the font whether the extension is &#42;.ttf or &#42;.otf.  But when I
    do the same thing with a TrueType-based OpenType fonts, standard Windows XP fonts
    for example, it says &#40;Opentype&#41; and on the next line &#34;OpenType Font,
    Digitally Signed, TryeType Outlines&#34;.  So these fonts have obviously been
    digitally signed, but does the designation TrueType get changed to OpenType in
    the process of signing a font? <BR> <BR>I would assume that signing a font won&#39;t
    affect compability?  So all the programs that support OpenType fonts on both Mac
    and PC will support and unsigned &#40;OpenType&#41; TTF font? <BR> <BR>I will
    keep Thawte in mind when I&#39;ve created my masterpieces and are ready to sell
    them. <BR> <BR>Thanks again!

  body: Yes, to all of the above. <BR> <BR>Specifically, I know of no applications
    &#40;certainly none of ours&#41; that use the presence or absence of a digital
    signature to determine whether to look for or use OpenType layout tables. They
    all just look for the tables themselves. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll second Adam&#39;s comments
    that the dividing line between &#40;Windows&#41; TrueType and OpenType is exceedingly
    thin. If one wants to make the distinction, it&#39;s basically a question of whether
    it has advanced layout tables such as GSUB and/or GPOS. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

    your font with ligatures, etc there isn&#39;t really any big difference between

    where the Mac flavor of TT fonts have resource forks with a bunch of stuff in
    the FOND resource. But that&#39;s another story. <BR> <BR>T
