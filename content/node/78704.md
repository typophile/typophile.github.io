body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to copy several alternate glyphs from one window
  font to another one (which not have alternate glyphs in it). I first select my alt
  glyphs (about 80) in my font window, copy, go to the other font window and paste.
  \r\nBut I get this annoying message saying : \"You have dropped glyphs at the places
  used by the glyphs with names listed below\u2026\" CANCEL or REPLACE. \r\n\r\nThe
  thing is that I named all my alternate glyphs \"xxx.alt\" and I have no such glyphs
  with that names in my new fontwindow. In fact the alert window says that the glyphs
  to be replaced by the alt glyphs are common ones (space, one, two, etc.). I really
  don't get it. Even with a new font window it does not create the extra glyphs but
  just replace some existing ones. Do I do something wrong (I guess so\u2026). Is
  it because my alternate glyphs have name but no unicode numbers ? Any help would
  be much appreciate ! Thanks."

    the coded glyphs in your new window.\r\n\r\nA better way is to copy all the glyphs
    you want to paste into a text editor.  Then select \"Search and Replace\"  replace
    each \"slash\" with a space.  Use this edited text to paste into the window of
    \"Generate New Glyphs\" window.  It will then generate the same naming order of
    glyphs as in your list.  After that, copy the glyphs from your original file,
    then select all the newly created alternates and paste into the window."

    the problem. There's probably a way to script this process, BUT what you need
    to do is to create glyph slots in your new font window for your alts. Select Names
    mode, then find a glyph slot that is normally blank--I usually use the one immediate
    to the tight of \"oe\"--and double-click. Then right-click/shift-click for the
    Properties dialog, and enter your first alt.glyph name. When you hit \"Apply,\"
    the box will relocate itself with its new name. Repeat the process for each new
    alt.glyph you want to add. When you're done, open your alt.glyph font and minimize
    it. Then select Tools &gt; Merge Fonts, and apply. FontLab will do all the cutting
    and pasting for you, without any \"annoying\" messages, and all your glyphs will
    be where you want them to be."

  body: Right click in the Font Window and select 'Append Glyphs'. This will paste
    the copied glyphs into the new font without overwriting any existing glyph cells.
    If glyphs already exist in the font that have the same names as appended glyphs,
    the latter will have a number added to their name, e.g. /glyph.001/.
