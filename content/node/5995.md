body: I set all the kerning/spacing in Fontographer Metrics Windows as I wanted it
  but after generating the font in TrueType format and trying to use it in any of
  my programmes &#40;Photoshop7.0, <BR>Illustractor 10 etc.&#41; it seems to have
  not recognised any of my alterations.  In fact it appears exactly the same as if
  the &#39;Kerning Checkbox&#39; in the Metrics Window was UNchecked but it isn&#39;t.  <BR>
  <BR>Any help would, I&#39;m sure be extremely useful and greatly appreciated. <BR>
  <BR>Cheers, Nick.
