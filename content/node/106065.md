  in all caps (example: UNTOLD: The Story Not Told). What is the best way to do this?
  My thoughts are that in headings it would be all caps just like the above, but in
  text UNTOLD would be U[smallcaps]ntold[/smallcaps] (that is, Untold with the \"ntold\"
  part in small caps, mixing the case). I also considered just ignoring the all-caps
  aspect in the text (referring to it as \"Untold: The Story Not Told\" in the text,
  but I'm not sure I can get away with that.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\nJustin"

    decision. But not caps & small caps.\r\n\r\nDoes your text face actually have
    italic small caps?"

  body: Yes, Adobe Minion Pro has italic small caps. I'm leaning towards using u&lc
    and not worrying about the title being in all caps then.

  body: "That the tittle was in all caps in the original book was simply a design
    decision. It has nothing to do with the title per se. As mentioned above, the
    usual determination would be made by an editor; if you're having to take that
    role, I think you're quite right to set it U&lc in the text.\r\n\r\nI do occasionally
    change a *style* for a title, almost alays with figures. If I were setting a book
    where <cite>Catch 22</cite> occurred a lot in the text, I'd use lining figures
    for the title, even if old-style was generally used for the text. Same with <cite>The
    Crying on Lot 49</cite>, etc. But not full caps -- unless you know for sure the
    full caps were the original autor's preference."
