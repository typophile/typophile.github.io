  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, new poster here (although I've lurked around the margins for a while)...  If I may, I'd appreciate some opinions on a new serif typeface I'm designing.  

This is my first attempt at a serif typeface, and my first serious attempt at a font fit for general consumption (my previous work has been for rather specialized uses).

Some remarks about my intentions... I basically set out to explore the possibilities of a humanist typeface with non-traditional styling.  (The serifs are loosely intended to recall engraved inscriptions, by the way.)  In the future I plan on adding at least partial Japanese support, and one of my other objectives is to see if it's possible to create a consistent style between the Latin and Japanese characters that manages to be culturally faithful to both.  (Most general-purpose Japanese fonts are woefully generic-looking, especially the serif/mincho ones.)

It's primarily intended as a document font that can also function reasonably well on-screen.  The serifs are deliberately understated to help the text render with minimal distraction.

Letter designs:  [[http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/new_inscription/letters.png]]
Sample text at various sizes:  [[http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/new_inscription/text_sample.png]]

I'm aware of a number of extant problems.  The strokes need to be darker in general (and the harmonization of stroke widths needs work).  I'm also thinking the contrast needs to be increased a little.  For printed text, the character spacing may be a little tight.  As far as the specific glyphs go, I'm not entirely convinced by a few characters, in particular some of the numbers.  I'm also wondering if the serifs might not be a bit <em>too</em> understated.

I'd welcome opinions from more experienced hands!  Thanks...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although I personally don't find this very exciting, I think it can certainly evolve into a usable font, and the Japanese angle is certainly interesting.

The first thing you should do is decide what point size range you're shooting for this, because that's what will lead you to a good balance of color versus spacing versus vertical proportions (noting for starters that the descenders are way too long compared to the ascenders).

		<div class="commentbody">Good point about the descenders... I'd overlooked that but on closer examination I have to agree with you.

The 10-12 point range is my main target, I suppose.  I plan to do a couple of other weights, though.

I'm actually a computer programmer by background... I stumbled into typeface design pretty much by accident – around ten years ago, I did a hasty mock-up of an old bitmap font to help myself create some user interface drawings, and the result somehow got adopted as the main menu & dialog font for several software programs.   So I've been trying to catch up on learning all I can about proper type design ever since.  

I've grown quite fascinated with the subject now...  a fondness for Japanese writing and calligraphy came along separately, but I figure I should find a way to combine the interests. :)

This is a learning exercise as much as anything else.

Thanks for the feedback!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, I'm also a programmer by training (although I've become quite rusty). Wrote my first program at age 9 on a Commodore PET, but in the early 80s made bitmap fonts for my C64 (with my brother's help) and even my Computer Science degree couldn't stop my eventual move to type design - although there is very much some overlap (especially these days). One thing I think computer people are good at in type design is spacing - let me know if you feel that too.

If you're shooting for around 11 point I'd say the color (thickness) needs to be bumped up (as you say) but the x-height is good - just shorten the descenders (quite a bit though). Also, the caps are on the big side - which means they're good at reference texts (where a reader has to search for proper nouns) but not so much for immersive reading.

		<div class="commentbody">OK, I've reworked things a bit.  The descenders are shorter and I redesigned the /S and /s glyphs, as well as the /a to some extent.  The /f, long-s and eszett share a slightly flatter curve now.  Most significantly, I've bumped up the stroke contrast, especially on the bowls.

Hmm... the current caps height works reasonably well at the smallest point sizes.  You do have a point, though, especially at the larger sizes.  

I'll up the colour a bit in the coming days.  I suspect I'll keep something close to the current incarnation to develop into a "light" weight, though.

I tweaked the /Z a little in this iteration – specifically, I made the top bar a bit shorter, which may help a bit.  The /M and /W I'll take a look at.

The capitals may still look a little large next to the lowercase, but I think part of that is due to the overly-compressed letter-spacing.  I need to space things out a bit more.

I'm not sure about how well the tail on the /u and /d works.  Anyone have thoughts on that? 

I added the proposed new uppercase Eszett character, mainly because I could. :p

Speaking of which, I've deliberately drawn the foot of the long-s without a serif, in order to differentiate it better from /f.  For consistency it was thus left off the regular eszett which is derived from it.  Does that seem like a good idea/bad idea/acceptable quirk?

Two PDFs with sample text are now attached (see above).  suzuran.pdf shows all supported characters, and a block of 12 pt text.  suzuran_sample.pdf has a shorter paragraph shown at a range of sizes.

I think this is a significant improvement.  It actually works better than I expected down to quite small sizes , at least off a good-quality laser printer. :p  

I think some of the curves may be a bit too heavy now.  I'm also not very happy with some of the counter shapes, especially the /s and /b-/d-/p-/q...  but I'll keep on tweaking.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks.  I do think it's getting steadily better.

There are many adjustments in the latest release, which can be seen in the attached suzuran_120629.pdf (above) or in http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/new_inscription/letters_5.png

Changes of note include reworking the serifs to make them sturdier-looking, adjusting the 'e' crossbar, trying to harmonize the bowl weights (still needs some work IMO), and smoothing out a lot of the counters (especially in the lowercase).

I don't know, though... there's still something not quite satisfactory about it, which I especially notice in paragraphs at 10-12pt.  I think maybe the stroke contrast might need to be increased still more.  

I'm also thinking I should change the numbers to text (rather than lining) figures.  I'm not really a big fan of old-style figures but in this case I think they fit the style a bit more.  (Since I'm using Typetool I have no way to add OpenType features, so it's pretty much one or the other.)</div>

L too wide.

W is too narrow. Looks cramped.

Get rid of the gaps in 6 and 9 or make them bigger.

When you say to make the bowls larger, I assume you mean vertically rather than width-wise?

The tail on /Q could be a bit more prominent, it's true.  On the other hand, I'm not generally a big fan of tails that sweep under adjacent characters, which is why it's confined to its own glyph space.  I may revisit that, though.

These and the other suggestions here certainly have merit, I'll look at each of them carefully.  Thanks!

What's concerning me at the moment is the oblique weighting in characters like /O/o, /C/c and to a certain extent /e.  I'm starting to think those characters are 'leaning' too far to the left.

I'm currently rather busy preparing to move from Japan to Canada so I don't expect to get much work done on this for the next several weeks...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking good. 
Serif at the top of C and G maybe hangs too low, and its shape might need tweaking.
Extending the right baseline serif of r and f more would ease spacing gaps.
The diagonal of 5 looks too slanted to me.
The accents look rather mechanical compared to the construction of the letters.
Titles, periods, and commas look too slight. 
Ear of g looks a bit sad. 
Top right of U looks wimpy. Could proportions of N's serif work there?
Is the difference in width between f's hood and j's hook an issue? I'm not sure.
I agree about shortening the descenders. </div>

Will take another look at the descenders on /j /p /q, maybe /y; OTOH I've experimented with a shorter /g and didn't care for the result.  

@eliason
Inclined to agree about the /U.  Possibly something between that and the /N serif.  

I think you're right about the /g's ear - I've never been really satisfied with it but haven't managed to come up with a better one yet.  Maybe it should simply be flared a little more.

The slant on the /5 is meant to loosely match the angle of /6 and /7 in the same region.

Good point about the baseline /f /r serif.  As far as the hook goes, I'm not perfectly happy with either the /f's or the /j's, but I decided early on not to go with the 'inverted-f' style /j.

I reduced the serif on /c and /r considerably in the last update, but I was admittedly less aggressive in doing the same to /C /G.  Will revisit.

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A nice dark corner of the craft:
This is a text face (where individual glyph beauty needs to be tamed "for the greater good") and the "g" happens to be exactly the glyph that needs to start looking a bit ungainly (due to being vertically cramped) for the font to be properly balanced (by not misusing the vertical space). Basically in a text font if the "g" is too beautiful more important things are going wrong.

Also: it's very rare for descenders to be at different depths (essentially for good reason) so whatever depth the "g" ends up at the others should (normally) follow.

Many other tweaks, including a narrower /e, modestly redesigned /f and /j, improvements to /3 and /5, larger bowls on /P and /R, slightly larger tittles, slight changes to accents, etc.

Also added several new characters, including section, 1/2, superscript 1-3, various diacritical forms and a few more ligatures.  I also put a set of modified lining figures back in (no OT features, I just stuck them into the PUA);  I noticed that when the PDF is generated by Scribus Acrobat only shows them as a second set of text figures (other PDF viewers seem to show them properly though), but the PDF here was generated by OpenOffice which seems OK.

I'm not really happy with the /a just yet.  I quite liked the earlier, wider form (seen in various posts above), but it didn't really fit in anymore with how I'd redesigned everything else over time.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the issue with the |U| is the bottom.  Try to down the curve, this will open the bottom. It also be enlarge to be between the H and the V. You will see after if you have to enlarge the |VWXY|. About the harmony I would say it's because some letters are too condensed. Compare the |s, g and u| to my point of view the |s| should be wider. For the |a| you could go up the left part of the top where the serif is, this will open the letter between the serif and the bowl. Keep going.</div>

This round, I've redesigned quite a few characters, especially /a and /e.
