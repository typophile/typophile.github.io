I have a few problems with the 'the' in Logo 7 and 3 as it seems to be disconnected to the rest of the logo and floating around a little too much. Also, the green grass/flame imagery looks like a custom shape from photoshop, which doesn't mean you shouldn't use it, but be aware that many other people will have access to this shape too, so it may seem a little too familiar or be used in other logos. Why not draw the exact shapes you require in illustrator?

		<div class="commentbody">Emma,

You have chosen the font Nueva that is best used as a stand-alone display font. It distracts from any illustration because it is so intricate and full of life. I wouldn't use fake small caps like you did in logo3. Here are some fonts I would consider purchasing for this job:

Lisboa
http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000080

Cronos
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cronos/

As far as logo7, I don't think the brush-drawn house is enough. Try combining the house with another element. It looks real estate.

Logo 4 is the best of the three so far. I like the friendliness of it. I would work on the plant illustration and make it more interesting. Do research and look at some plants on stock photography websites like corbis or veer. Keep the illustration 1-color so it could be cut out of vinyl.

I look forward to seeing what you come up with next.

-Tom

I agree that "Teach Green" is probably a bit over-the-top for a tagline - even though I agree in concept, it feels too much like a bumper sticker on a veggie-car.     

I also agree that Dan's post isn't constructively worded, but I'd like to believe perhaps Dan is a bit over-caffeinated (I'm fairly sure he doesn't want us to give him a "beak") and meant nothing aggressive or negative in his tone. </div>

I can understand the rationale behind the tagline but I don't belive it "works". You can do better in my opinion. You really should try harder. Perhaps something like "Teach, Build and Live Green" or take green out and stick with "Teach Build Live". Just throwing out some ideas. Which is what I feel you need to do. You seem "married" to an idea and that is a big mistake as a designer in my opinion. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of the three ideas you've posted so far, I think # 4 works best. But I wouldn't use Nueva (I think Tom's comment is right on the mark) and I would try to simplify the whole thing a little. My suggestion is that you keep "unity" in mind when working on subsequent drafts: all the different elements (image + the + energy pros + tag line, or whatever combination you choose) need to be connected and feel like a visual unit.

It would be interesting to learn a little more about your project: what image exactly your client wants to project; the core values of the "Energy Pros" brand (if they've gone so far as to define their market positioning, which a surprising number of clients don't seem to give much thought to before trying to create or change their visual identity); etc.</div>

I tend to agree that the mark doesn't bring anything unique to the table as far as eco friendly housing - there's more to it than plants.

I believe you may have chosen the original font to give it a more 'approachable' feel, but it really misses the mark, coming across as approachable, but home business-like and not overly professional - which becomes confusing cause by including the word "Pros" in the name ... well if they are Pros they wouldn't need to tell you that.

I agree with comments made about the tag line. It doesn't really suit their business, I don't know that they'd be 'teaching green' much. Seems like it may have been a bit quick to jump on the "green bandwagon" surely there is something more unique about what they TRULY do then the catch of "green" is healthy/friendly.

Would love to see your further developments.

That may very well be the case. But from the way she worded it seemed it was her idea. My apologies if it came out harsh in any way, that was not my intent:). I just feel the logo can be much better despite of it's name and tagline.

<em>She posted the logo for critique, but she has not stated that she needs help with the name or tagline.</em>

True, but isn't the tagline part of the logo? Will it ever be apart from the logo? If not then the tagline should be part of the consideration, no? I understand that sometimes we don't have the option of changing certain things. But I feel as designers we have to be parental, in a sense, with our clients. Like an inexpirienced child (client) who doesn't know what's best for them, it's up to the parent(designer) to guide them in the right direction. Besides, my suggestion and the suggestions of other are modification of the exsisting tagline, not it's elimination.

One problem with designing for this kind of message is that there are a Ton of visual cliches now because there are many many business' in the space. I encourage you to think it terms of how do you distinguish yourself from competition 1st & foremost. And that might mean screwing with the tagline. It might even mean a different name. Sure the client might say no, but respect yourself and ask for what you need to do the job.

'Energy Pros' is such an 80's way of thinking about green. Not that it isn't important. But you can be quite efficient and quite toxic ( & un-green) at once. If you do get them to change the name CHARGE them for it! And charge them again if you manage to come up with a replacement - or participate in the process.

I think taglines are dumb 99% of the time. Unless you have a huge advert budget and are selling a product - they don't work and signal an identity that is half baked and needs proping up.

I don't think you're coming off harsh one bit. You're a 100% correct. Personally, I would consider a strictly typographic solution because of all the visual cliches attached to this particular industry (even though there are still some visual devices available that will work in my opinion.
