  to me it looks like a heavier version of Papyrus or could easily be a custom/hand
  drawn font.  \r\nI'm creating a series of flyers for this club nights upcoming events
  and the people running it want me to use their original logo. Unfortunately they
  don't have any JPEG's or Illustrator files of the logo. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/302027_143216005768741_100002410273995_239755_35244_n_4410.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  guys."
