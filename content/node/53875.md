  body: Do you mean that it won a prize, or that it was entered into the judging?
    In any case, I think that the design looks great!

    the first time I've entered so naturally I was pretty happy. \r\n\r\nAnd\u2026
    as timing would have it, the motherboard on my home computer just went down. Fortunately
    I have a backup copy to work with at my workplace.\r\n\r\nStephen"

    the TDC to announce the winners publicly.

    was for all that. i just got the letter and since it didn't say anything about
    formal announcements I didn't know what to expect. I would imagine there are others
    here on the list as well. "
