  the \"newest\" Latin-based character which is a combination question mark/exclamation
  mark. I don't know of many typefaces that contains this glyph as part of its set,
  although it is included in the Calibri typeface which is the default font for Office
  2007. \r\n\r\nIn InDesign, you can find this glyph if you open the Glyphs panel
  and choose to show \"Punctuation.\" \r\n\r\nI'm attaching this glyph to this posting.\r\n\r\n"
