  typographical conventions (if it isn't, I doubt one exists) but here goes. You often
  see measurements in feet and inches represented like this: 3'5\" meaning 3 feet,
  5 inches. You also see the same thing for minutes and seconds: 12'34\" meaning 12
  minutes, 34 seconds. And even with minutes and seconds as subdivisions of degrees,
  rather than as measurements of time: 12\xB017'22\" meaning 12 degrees, 17 minutes
  and 22 seconds. My question is: where did this convention originate, and when did
  it make the transition from one context to the other? (And are there other units
  that this convention is applied to?)"

    as all get, but looking through the history of astronomy, mapmaking, mathematics
    and measurements will likely help.

  body: If it can shed some light on the matter, in Italian, the scientific definition
    of minutes is "minuti primi", and that of seconds is "minuti secondi", where "primi"
    and "secondi" mean respectively "first" and "second". So it most probably comes
    from a form of superscript ordinal Roman numerals (I and II).

    prime, not quote marks.

  body: "Yes, it should have been 3&prime;5&Prime;, but I wasn't sure the forum formatting
    was up to it... It turns out that it is.\r\n\r\nThe theory about them being corruptions
    of little Roman numerals is interesting. The wiki page on prime does mention that
    watchmakers sometimes used \"triple prime\" (\u2034) to mean a \"ligne\": one
    sixtieth of a second. However, the wiki page on ligne (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligne)
    says that ligne was a measure of distance. So I'm no closer to even working out
    where the convention originated..."

  body: "A very nice find. Besides the unusual symbols for astrological aspects on
    that page, that primes sloped in reverse are used to indicate higher integer powers
    of 60 is something that was news to me.\r\n\r\nThis site: [[http://www.luigigobbi.com/EarliestUsesOfSymbolsOfOperation/]]
    notes that Cajori's survey of the history of mathematical notation cited a book
    from 1571, [[http://books.google.ca/books?id=6NnUKv3eihEC|Prutenicae tabulae coelestium
    motuum]], by Erasmus Reinhold, as the earliest example of the use of this notation
    known - but a different notation for the same thing was used by Ptolemy in the
    <em>Almagest</em>. (Cajori is cited on this web page as disagreeing with an older
    view that credited Ptolemy as the first user of the prime notation, ignoring the
    difference in the appearance of the symbols used.)"

  body: "Another very nice find, John. So the convention probably originates in 16th-century
    astronomy. (I also doubt the attribution to Ptolemy that Cajori mentions; I don't
    think there are any ancient papyri of the Almagest, and the notations in medieval
    manuscripts vary quite a lot, but perhaps use of the keraia for fractions had
    some influence.)\r\n\r\nSo if this convention was transposed by to feet and inches,
    I suppose it must have been by analogy of duodecimal notation to sexagesimal.
    The exact form of the analogy seems to have been unsettled until well into the
    19th century, though, because I found some examples using \u2032 for inches and
    \u2033 for twelfths of inches:\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=Y9oPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA125\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=ICNLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA251"
