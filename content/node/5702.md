body: i&#39;ve heard that Filosofia is ok to use on text body, but it seems like the
  spaces between words are tiny, making legibility poor. <BR> <BR>anyone else have
  this problem? is this just a problem with my computer or something?? the spacing
  on all my other fonts is fine. <BR> <BR>thanks-
