  body: "\r\nSorry about that.\r\n\r\nI think I havce always stated on my page that
    Sibyl is a Schwabacher. Maybe the confusion\r\narises from the fact that all Schwabachers
    are grouped under my\r\nblackletter subpage.\r\n\r\nAbout Maus: My definition
    of octagonal is roughly that all strokes\r\nare linear and either vertical, horizontal
    or at a 45 degree angle.\r\nThere are also rounded versions of this. By my definition,
    Maus is\r\noctagonal. Others might call it \"mechanical\" since the angles and
    the look match\r\nthose of heavy bolts. \r\n\r\nIn any case, as Stephen said,
    I am always open to corrections."

  body: "Thanks for clarifying Luc. My concern stemmed from seeing Sibyl listed under
    a page heading \"Fraktur fonts\" on one page. That listing no long appears. Thanks
    Luc  : )\r\n\r\nUli, I was refering to that one instance, not the other descriptions
    of the font as \"schwabacher\".\r\n\r\n<em>Before designing letters, you should
    learn to read letters.</em>\r\n\r\nBefore saying anything Uli you should learn
    to withold your judgement of other people's abilities. And look further; I found
    something you did not find. You just didn't see it listed as a fraktur.\r\n\r\n<em>\u201CFraktur\u201D
    is the generic term for ***ALL*** such fonts comprising ***ALL*** sub-categories
    including Schwabacher.</em>\r\n\r\nFraktur is a genera and generic term for blackletters,
    but is not the specific term for schwabacher type designs. That's my point.\r\n\r\n<em>Therefore
    books on ***ALL*** such fonts have the main title \u201CFraktur\u201D, although
    they also deal with the sub-category of Schwabacher fonts.</em>\r\n\r\nDo they
    really? You sound very sure---have you checked them all? That's inflexible \"this
    is a sub-set of that\" kind of rationale. Things don't have to be neccessarily
    so unless you insist. I'm a humanist and take an intuitive view. Fraktur is more
    than a generic term for fractured letterforms---it is also a specific type of
    blackletter.\r\n\r\nAs for Maus: this is typography, not mathematics, right? It's
    no big deal, my point is that Maus' letters have six sides or less, not eight,
    and octagonal is innacurate in that sense. But I'm not fussed about that one.
    Minor point.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "James, many, many German books use Fraktur as a generic term for all blackletters.
    It is just the way the language developed. For hundreds of years, the most commonly-used
    sort of blackletter in Germany were Fraktur types. I guess it became sort of a
    \"brand,\" you know, like Kleenex tissues or Xerox machines. Or Hoovers in England
    or whatever!\r\n\r\nThe point is, you are right, when using English. But in German,
    one can call a Schwabacher a \"Fraktur,\" even when it isn't. Real typographers
    know the difference anyway, I guess. Sorry, but I think that Uli is correct here."

    We are talking about German names for German (mostly) typefaces. If we English

    up with the types and terms in the first place have a point of view that we know
    and consider. \r\n\r\n3. Luc's site has an international audience. English-language
    typographic terms are not necessarily the international norm or default. Wasn't
    the first official language of the ATypI French?\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, does Luc having
    classified your font incorrectly (if it was incorrect) really harm you, your design,
    or your font sales in any way? Luc's site is private, and is not affiliated with
    your work or with MyFonts.com\u2026"
