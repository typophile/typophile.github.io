  Stefan Sagmeister for a punctuation poster series. What I like about the design
  is that it is playful yet smart. I like design that has a concept; its not just
  cool-looking. This is sort of a departure from Sagmeister's usual work, which is
  mostly hand-done. I really like the hand-drawn look, but it intimidates me because
  I have never tried incorporating the pen into my work. Since it does intimidate
  me, I will probably try it soon!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sagmeister.com/index.html\r\n\r\nHis
  website's homepage is a little much for me, but I really like the navigation. "
