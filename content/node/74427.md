body: "Q: What face would you use to set an edition of Kafka's <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIt's
  an interesting challenge, not just because of the usual considerations, but because
  the shortness of the text \u2013 on the order of 50 pages \u2013 probably expands
  the possibilities, making possible faces that would be too quirky or tiresome in
  a longer text, or perhaps a sans or slab serif. In the same vein, I'm willing to
  bump up the size to 12 points or so, if a face would benefit from it, because with
  a text this short, a few extra pages won't break the bank.\r\n\r\nMy current rumination
  is [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lanston_type_co/ltc_powell_regular/|LTC
  Powell]], which to my eyes looks like Kelmscott Press meets Edward Gorey, which
  would suit the fairy-tale-of-horror tone of the story. I feel it's a little over
  the top though. \r\n\r\nI'm also trying to figure out what the [[http://typophile.com/node/74421|original
  edition]] was set in..."

  body: "Thanks Frank -- that font has an interesting concept...\r\n\r\nSomeone helpfully
    ID'd the font in the original as Tiemann-Mediaeval, available [[http://www.romana-hamburg.de/antiqua.htm|here]],
    along with [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/bogtrykkeren/4948458881/lightbox/|Genzsch-Antiqua]],
    which I think might be the ticket -- except I can't figure out how you order from
    that site...\r\n\r\nThose both look like great faces, I'm surprised they aren't
    anywhere on FontShop or MyFonts."

    any case I wouldn't use anything literally \"horrory\".\r\n\r\nBTW, the Genzsch
    has a fascinating Italic - a bit like Avance actually!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and make the the chapter or section titles or first words expressive. They could
    even undergo a metamorphosis, as the story progresses. You could even draw eg
    changing drop caps. '

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions, all.\r\n\r\nAnd Hrant, I think you may have read
    my mind. Before I started in my current direction (dark, rough-looking turn-of-the-century
    serifs like Powell and Genzsch), I originally wanted some kind of contemporary
    slab-serif-ish face, but after a solid day looking, nothing had passed muster.
    And Avance is almost exactly what I had in mind for that look. Now if I could
    only get the FontShop \"beta\" PDF specimen to work...\r\n\r\nBill, I like your
    idea of saving the expressive stuff for those kinds of elements."

    than... The Metamorphosis.
