    available free. The biggest problems with the exiting version is that you can't
    see your results graphically within the program itself.\r\n\r\nThere were plans
    underway to release a version in 2012 with a graphic user interface but, as far
    as I know, that hasn't happened."

    It works rather well and if you combine it with manual kerning you save time and
    achieve good results.\r\nI will buy it as soon as it is released."
