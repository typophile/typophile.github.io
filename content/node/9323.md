body: Many, many years ago, my dad rescued a phototypsetting machine &#40;he is the
  patron saint of machines&#41;. He inteded to convert it to computer control, but
  lost interest in that project a good while ago. <BR> <BR>Now it&#39;s just sitting
  in the corner of our woodshop under a tarp. Like my dad, I dread throwing anything
  out that others worked so hard to make, but I need the room it&#39;s occupying.  <BR>
  <BR>Any suggestions other than boat anchor?
