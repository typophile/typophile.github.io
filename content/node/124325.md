  I've been a fan of typophile for many years, but recently joined. \r\n\r\nI'm trying
  to find the typeface used in the poster for Woody Allen's Sleeper. An isolated version
  is attached, and you can view the original poster here:\r\nhttp://www.impawards.com/1973/sleeper_ver1.html\r\n\r\nThis
  could be completely custom, or at least I believe the swashes are. Any clues or
  guesses would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"
