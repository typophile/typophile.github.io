body: Hi all. I could use some help - I&#39;ve been working on the redesign of a sports
  magazine, along with the redesign the title is changing as well. Here are a few
  masthead designs. The client initially wanted to empahsize the word &#34;Tennis&#34;
  and downplay &#34;US&#34;, now they want to see more of a balance between the words.
  Red and Blue will probably be the main color palette, however it may change from
  issue to issue depending upon the cover art. With that in mind the flag &#34;E&#34;
  versions might not work in a different color combo. Please, your thoughts on which
  of these is working. Am I turning it into too much of a logo? One big concern is
  it should not look similar to Tennis Magazine. see bottom attachment. One final
  note the magazine only goes to subscribers, it&#39;s not for sale on newsstands.

    is not working yet. Have you tried incorporating any kind of graphic elements
    &#40;net, ball, racket, racket strings, etc.&#41;? Maybe a graphic of some kind
    could help that &#34;E&#34; area. I think the &#34;E&#34; is less important than
    the other letters. Even if it was an empty space there &#40;please don&#39;t take
    that as a suggestion&#41; the word would still read as Tennis. My point is that
    maybe that is a flexible space. I also think the &#34;S&#34;s need to be a little
    taller. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I reworked the first two mastheads. I liked the
    interlocking letters and tried an extended version of the letterforms to give
    it a little more weight. I also created a version with the US and Tennis on one
    line, not interlocked. On the second masthead &#40;of the original post&#41; I
    lost the flag E and played with adding a graphic element to the type &#40;a ball&#41;
    I&#39;ll have to try this on some covers, not sure if the ball will be confusing
    with other balls that may be in the cover art. Final version I used a dot instead
    of a photographic ball.  <BR> <BR>Am I heading in the right direction with these?

  body: I quickly worked on one of Andrew&#39;s suggestions. Attached is the serif
    interlocked version with a modified T. What I had liked about the version I first
    did was that the serif in the T also acted as the negative inner curve of the
    s  - which is squareish. Perhaps that&#39;s one of those design ideas that works
    in your head and not on paper. The modified T is sort of working but isn&#39;t
    quite there yet. Perhaps the rest of the letters need some adjustments as well
    or perhaps I should play with some other fonts. I also think version 5 of second
    posting with the yellow dot has merit too will work on both and post again soon.  <BR>-Kirsten

  body: Perhaps just me, but in the interlocking versions &#40;less with the serifs
    chopped&#41; I find the lower curve of the S tends to combine with the upstroke
    of the T to make a P shape, so I see both Tennis and Pennis. I much prefer the
    simpler versions. I think I&#39;d say &#34;What is the interlocking really adding?&#34;.
    For me at least its just adding confusion.

  body: If you go with the interlocking version you have to change the value of either
    the red or the blue. They have the same value and the interlocking area vibrates.
    You could solve this with a white stroke around the interacting letters. I don&#39;t
    know why it has to be flag red and flag blue.

    &#34;Tennis&#34; would be slightly irritating.  <BR> <BR>Forget the Tennis ball
    represenation, it adds complexity. Magazine mastheads, in my opinion, should be

    slabs, grots or even a heavier serif. hmmm. and it really is friendly.  <BR> <BR>however,
    and i&#39;m NOT a tennis fan or aficionado &#40;ok, guilty pleasure watch agassi&#41;
    but i do perceive that they want to be taking just as seriously as any other sport,

  body: First, thank you all for your ideas and comments. After spending quite a bit
    of time in Border&#39;s magazine section I realized I was trying to do too much
    with this. Simplified the sans serif and slab versions. Did keep one version with
    the reversed N. I felt it illustrates the head-to-head competion of tennis. However
    &#40;and especially because it is an N&#41; I doubt I&#39;ll end up using it because
    it will be too similar to the Nine Inch Nails symbol.  <BR> <BR>The forum seemed
    split between the slab and the sans so I&#39;ll probably show both to the client.
    Funny I was favoring the slab, but now I like the sans with no space between the
    US and Tennis or the all blue with yellow dot version. Keep it simple.  <BR> <BR><img

  body: I like the third from the top and the 5th from the top. However, the yellow
    ball is begging for its seams back.&#40;not the photographic version, but a simple
    graphic rendering would probably do. The addition of the seems would also imply
    motion which would be a good bonus.&#41; <BR> <BR>Have You tried an all Green
    Version?  <BR> <BR>Honestly, by having a specific set of colors you are potentially
    limiting your graphic pallette down the road.  <BR> <BR>What happens when you
    have a beautiful photograph that has a blue&#40;or Red&#41;background? You might
    feel the need to change the colors of your logotype.  <BR> <BR>I was always told
    that a logo should be able to work in black and white 1st, and color 2nd. <BR>
    <BR>You might want to try some versions with solid colors throughout. <BR> <BR>ps.Forth
    from the top feels Swedish.

  body: Hi, I&#39;m back again with another revision to this masthead. It&#39;s negative
    space around the ball not a white line, so when the masthead is on top of the
    art, the art will show through. The colors will be dependant upon the cover photo/illus.,
    but in looking over past issues, these were colors that were frequently used.
    I steered away from putting a seam on the tennis ball for two reasons 1. Tennis
    magazine used a seamed tennis ball as the dot over the &#34;i&#34; for about 25
    years prior to their recent logo redesign. and 2. The more litteral ball depiction
    &#40;with seam&#41; looks odd when the ball is in a color other than yellow. <img

    loose. Do you agree? Or should I tighten TENNIS to match US? And does anyone feel
    the perfect circle doesn&#39;t jive with the imperfect soft Garage font? I tried
    using period from the font as the ball but it looks like a mis-shapen blob to
    me.

    a simple circle in between the two words implying transition, movement, and of
    course the tennis ball.
