  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi. I'm sorry if this is the wrong section, but I have been a long time lurker here and usually have my answers solved by searching or reading other peoples posts.

I have the font set LTR Federal from letterror. (http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/federal_shop1.jpg)


This is my first time with opentype fonts and I am trying to learn. 

In his description and instructions, he advises:

This is best done in some sort of graphics application, like Illustrator or Freehand. Create an object with the text, size and location you need. Select one of the four optical sizes, for instance Eighteen Line (as in this diagram), then choose the one of the drop-shadow shadings: named HShadow for the horizontal shade lines and DShadow for diagonal shadelines. Set the font color for the Shadow layer. 

This is simple enough, but I cannot seem to find the "drop shadow shadings" he mentions, hshadow, etc... I have tried in Freehand, Illustrator, and PS CS3. I am so lost on how to achieve the affects he has made with these fonts. I understand layering and using photoshop, but I cannot figure out where I am to find dshadow etc. 

Please advise, because I would much like to use these fonts, and can't until I solve this. Thanks to everyone.

		<div class="commentbody">What exactly do you want to do with OpenType?

Do you want to convert your outlines of characters, with the various effects from different programs, and import them into a font editor to produce an OpenType font to use in MS Word or Adobe InDesign to produce your desired results?

To do so, you must think outside of the box.

A typical font editor can not produce the same effects that your can create in Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, or Freehand. Rather, a good flexible font editor can make a font which creates characters that look like the desired results you showed in your link.

Like most people, you think that OpenType is the key to almost everything. 

OpenType is merely a new sophisticated font format, used by many font editors. Most font editors can not offer all the advanced features of OpenType. Maybe in another 5 years. Maybe 10. Maybe never. 

MicroSoft and Adobe have created advanced tools to harness much of OpenType. One is called VOLT; one is called a tool kit. Each is not intuitive and easy to use. 

To succeed, you must know its capabilities and limitations. Then, think of a way to achieve your goal with those limited capabilities. That's thinking outside of the box.

Over a decade ago, I created a font with characters like those that appear in your link. I did it in Fontographer, now from FontLab at www.fontlab.com by creating all the different graphic shaded elements as different characters. Then, I pasted composites of them in different character locations for the alphabet. The solid black or white elements I drew in those locations. 

Even though it looked like a mess, after I created a PostScript font, it printed as desired. PostScript fonts in those days did not render on the screen until after Apple and MicroSoft came out with TrueType, ad then Adobe followed with Adobe Type Manager.

Today, we have MicroSoft and Adobe offering OpenType. I won't get into the advantages of OpenType over TrueType, but it's only time for Apple to offer a new font format, code-named, "Bric-or-Brac", or Everything-You-Could-ImagineType. I got a beta. Boy, it makes OpenType look like rotten tuna fish!</div>

the various shading parts for Federal are all in separate fonts. The Federal fonts are released in OpenType format, but layering and color effects are not OpenType features. You need to do some assembly.

If you install all the fonts from your download, you should have the following items in your font menu:

> Federal
> FederalSix
> FederalNine
> FederalTwelve
> FederalEighteen
> FederalReserveNote

The first, Federal, is the font with the regular, unshaded forms. Use this to set the initial text and get the size and position right.
The numbered entries, Six, Nine, Twelve and Eighteen Line are sets of shades with different levels of detail. 

For instance, in the Eighteen menu you will find 5 fonts with shades and parts for the 18 line version:
> Bevel
> DShadow
> Diagonal
> HShadow
> Horizontal

Bevel is the three dimensional looking body. It makes the letters appear as if cut out. 
DShadow contains the diagonal (D) shading for the shadow. This fits behind the bevel.
HShadow is the same, but now horizontal lines.
Diagonal and Horizontal contain the shading for inside the letters. These need to go on top. 

Your download also includes a FederalManual.pdf in which the layering process is shown step by step.
The Sample Art folder contains 4 illustrator documents with lots and lots of examples of layered words in all sorts of different combinations and color schemes.

If you can't find these files, send me the order number off-list and I will send you a new set.
Cheers, Erik

		<div class="commentbody">Erik,

thanks! I'll look through for all my info, and see whats there. I actually ordered these a long time ago through my company, and just got the chance to use them for the first time, so I will look around for all the info.

Thanks to both for your advice. When I installed the fonts, I do have 

> Federal
> FederalSix
> FederalNine
> FederalTwelve
> FederalEighteen
> FederalReserveNote

showing up, but I don't have  a "menu" for like federal18... I don't know where it would be, in any of the programs, but I'm assuming it's where it would usually say "italic" "bold" etc.... and they aren't there... I must have installed them improperly. 

I just went through windows fonts, clicked install new font, and located the OTF folder and installed the fonts there. Was there more I was supposed to do??

I'll have to look for my order number... I'm not sure if I still have the info, it has been a long time and my company has changed around a lot as of late, meaning i don't know if the info is still on their servers.

Thanks for the help so far.

Eric</div>

I guess I have a couple of questions. In which application's font menu are you looking? Which operating system?
If you like, send me the name of your company and I can look it up. You can contact me at erik (at) letterror.com if you prefer.

Cheers,
Erik</div>
