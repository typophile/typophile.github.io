  body: "I've spent a good part of the day trying to get iTunes to...well it's a long
    story having to do with moving my library to an external hard drive and then having
    the drive letter change on me. \r\n\r\nTen hours and a dose of frustration later,
    I finally got it to reinstall and find all my music. Since it thinks it is a new
    library, it wanted to erase and re-sync everything on my iPod (not sure how many
    CDs, but on a 30 Gb iPod, I had to uncheck about 60 some CDs to make them fit.\r\n\r\nI
    have the largest Mexican Trio collection of any white guy in North America, (I'm
    pretty sure). Also the largest collection of Lucha Villa, Lola Beltran, Chelo,
    and Maria Dolores Pradera recordings.\r\n\r\nRight now it up to 5,000 of about
    8,000 songs in the sync mode after about 2-3 hours (slow computer).\r\n\r\nThe
    watched iPod sync never boils, so I've been trying to do other stuff."

  body: That was only part of the 'long' story. So as to not advertise how air-headed
    I can be, I'll spare you the many-faceted details.

    I first heard it in Almod\xF3var's 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breaksdown',
    I was transfixed. It was after that I started combing stores in TJ and Ensenada,
    Guadalajara, wherever I could, looking for any old recordings.\r\n\r\nOn one of
    my favorites, she gives an incredible 2 hour performance on \"Concierto En Vivo
    En Bellas Artes '76\", near the end of her prime. I think it is out of print.
    (not to be confused with another concert she did there that isn't as good)."
