  body: "Very interesting font!\r\n\r\nThe bottom (lowercase) set has a couple issues
    that I can see.\r\n\r\n-The \"e\" looks too similar to the \"c\" and by itself
    looks more like a small \"p\". Does the stem (or descender) have to be straight?
    If not, I'd curve it or give it a tail that came back under itself to the right
    to give it more shape.\r\n\r\n-The same with the bottom of the \"c\". It really
    looks more like an \"r\" right now.\r\n\r\n-The \"z\" looks more like a \"3\"
    to me. I know it's supposed to be a cursive/script \"z\", but as it is right now,
    you'd be spelling 3ebras, not zebras.\r\n"
