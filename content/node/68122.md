body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post and I hope it's in the right place.
  I am trying to identify the typefaces used in \"The Sun\" (NYC: 1835-196), the daily
  newspaper in which \"Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus\" first appeared in 1897.
  I am specifically looking for the body and headlines....school project here at [[http://www.cca.edu|California
  College of the Arts]].\r\n\r\nHere is an example a standard page, as preserved by
  Chronicling America:\r\n[[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1904-11-27/ed-1/seq-23.pdf]]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn
  explanatory article of the \"new\" Sun's typography\r\n[[http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/new_york_new_york/typography_in_the_sun.php]]\r\n\r\nAnd
  the wiki article about the paper:\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(New_York)]]\r\n\r\nThe
  body text to be close to Bookman Oldstyle or even Clarendon, but I am TOTALLY stumped
  on the headlines.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!\r\nMax\r\n\r\n"

  body: Max, this should be posted in the Type ID Board. You'll get more help there.
    You could ask one of the [[http://typophile.com/moderators|moderators]] to move
    it.

  body: The large headline and subhead are cuts of Caslon. The middle headline is
    Encore and the bottom headline is Laureate. These are old metal typefaces and
    I don't know if there are digital versions. I can't tell what the body text face
    is, but it's some sort of newspaper face (something like Ionic, but older).
