body: "This just in from a review of an new IPad app:\r\nFor non-musicians unfamiliar
  with the ways music is made today, here\u2019s a clue: It\u2019s no longer necessary
  to play an instrument to create a musical composition.\r\n\r\nWhere to begin?\r\nWhere
  to end?\r\n\r\nBegin - disgust. Assemblage as tastemaker? You are merely critics.
  Why study the rules of composition when you can cut and paste Beethoven's best (or
  worst, depending on your purview)? Imagine the post-romantic pastiche you could
  create? It could be more unfocused than his compositions, which would be quite an
  achievement. What if you sampled all your favorite notes from  Eric Clapton and
  assembled them in a way he could not possibly have ever played? Can you imagine?
  Magnificent.\r\n\r\nEnd - Once the philosophical value of someone dedicated to a
  singular purpose, like learning to play guitar or sing ends, mother earth will cry.
  Perhaps, once it evolves, and people are sampling the samplers, re-sampled into
  eternity, the most radical thing that anyone can do is to build a guitar (since
  they won't be available anymore) and play. Perhaps now.\r\n\r\nPlaying an instrument
  is the most spiritual thing I do. It wasn't at first, it was actually very uncomfortable
  and frustrating. Now that I've done it for years, it's the finest place I visit,
  as long as my intentions are pure.\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nI believe
  this to be completely on topic because after reading this board for a long time
  I imagine font creation to be like this, perhaps not as immediate, but similar.
  Intentions and all that\u2026\r\n\r\nReality on the ground is hard to perceive unless
  you look down.\r\n\r\npbc"

    performance art, but you don't need to be a calligrapher to make fonts, and this
    has always been true.\r\n\r\nA musical composition that would be hard to perform
    live (especially at the 3:00 minute mark):\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVja2pjrEgI&feature=related\r\nI
    suspect Olivier Messaien would have approved."

  body: Lately I often find myself wondering who future generations will remember
    as the great type designers of our era. Will anyone really care about the designers
    who masterfully crafted big type families based on the fonts and lettering of
    the past? Or will then remember designers like Chank Diesel and Ray Larabie who
    produced thousands of wild and crazy designs without getting hung up on tradition?
