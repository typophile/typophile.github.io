body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI have a font family with 8 weights - light, regular, medium,
  bold, with italics.  The fonts are all named using the system found at this link:\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=1&ID_Message=2843\r\n\r\nEverything
  works fine in Adobe applications, such as InDesign, Illustrator on the mac and PC.
  In these programs all the weights are under the same name and are ordered from light
  to bold, however, when testing the fonts in windows applications, such as Word,
  big problems!!! \r\n\r\nNot all the weights appear in the font menus.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a solution to this problem, or is it just that OpenType fonts don't work in
  applications like Word?\r\n\r\nWhat do other people use as a solution to the problem?"

  body: Just follow the linked tutorial correctly, then it should work. Seems like
    you did something wrong. In apps like word you should see your font in the menu
    broken down in sub families (My Garamond Lt/My Garamond Rg).

  body: We recently experienced some similar problems with some weights of an extended
    family not appearing in Office 2008/mac applications. Worked fine everywhere else
    and was set up as prescribed. Is your situation limited to Word 2008 or have you
    seen it in other versions of Word/Office?

    for Bold and Italic. That's the whole idea of this name treatment. ;-)

    seem to be missing the end of the file names - I don't know why this is, or if

    will be available when you choose the light style and press the Bold button. \r\nThis
    is correctly set up in your table. \r\nSince you have 8 styles it's easy to break
    this down to two families with 4 styles (reg/ita/bold/bold italic) each. "

  body: "Ralf,\r\n\r\nI realise that's the way it should work but it's not.\r\n\r\nTo
    test the fonts I made copies of them and replaced the uppercase A with shapes,
    so the light weight has a square and the medium a circle. When I test in Word
    the light weight with the bold option still shows the square in the light weight.
    \r\n\r\nI'll check all my naming again, but I'm sure it's right.\r\n\r\n"

    for the PostScript FontName that there should always be a hyphen and a \"style\"
    after that. Omitting this for the \"regular\" can actually cause problems in some
    situations (notably for Type 1 fonts with more than one font in the family, in
    Adobe app font menus).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "An earlier test was: Install a TT OT family on both Windows and MacOS machines,
    create a document in Freehand/Win, open it in Freehand/Mac. If there is \"Regular\"
    present in TT OTFs, Freehand/Mac cannot find the font.\r\n\r\n<em>BUT:</em> Reading
    my descripting and older emails again, I have a suspicion that in the problematic
    test fonts there was a \"Regular\" not only in the PS Font Name but possibly also
    in the Full Name. Then it would have been the Full Name causing the cross-platform
    font identification problem! Hope I can repeat this test (much) later -- no Freehand
    on my current Windows machine.\r\nIf what I suspect is true, I should re-phrase:
    If you generate TT OTFs, \"Regular\" is <em>not required</em> in PS Font Name,
    as can be seen in MS's own TT fonts."
