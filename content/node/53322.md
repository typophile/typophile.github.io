body: "I have searched far and wide and cannot figure out what this typeface is. It
  is used in Rolling Stone magazine primarily for article titles. It replaced Farnham
  at some point in mid-2008. I attached an image from an RS mag to see if anyone can
  figure it out. I keep thinking I'm so close but then I notice the distinct serifs
  on the lowercase a's and r's. Please help! Anyone! Thanks.\r\n\r\nImage: \"Prepare
