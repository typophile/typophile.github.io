body: "I used this font for this *one word* in a logo long ago (possibly early-mid
  2000s). I had the font in my system at the time, I did not alter it.\r\nNote the
  irregularities in the \"S\", the not quite level bottom stroke on the \"E\" and
  of course the unusual \"G\".\r\nOther font ID sources aren't tracking this. One
  came close with \"Cordoba\" but that's not it. \r\n\r\n"
