  .TTF font (eg. \u201C\xE7\xC7\u201D, \u2026).\r\n\r\nIn fact it\u2019s a font with
  many separated weight (each weight is a .TTF file)\L.\r\nWhen I export each file
  (after formated it as OTF table) everything goes well.\L\r\nBut, when All the fonts
  are installed, well only see one of them into Adobe\xAE Illustrator\xAE font menu.\r\n\r\nHow
  is that possible?\r\n\r\nNB. I checked all the fonts with FontDoctor\xAE, and No
  font problems were diagnosed!\L\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, have a nice day\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-

    OTstyleNames for each of them.
