  this is from?  All the text in the screenshot is made with various sizes of this
  same font.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen3tj_4924.png]

  body: This is an alphabet specific to this game, and thus most likely has no equivalent
    in digital type. I could be wrong though.

    body: "Bald: Thanks, but I'm afraid you are indeed wrong.  I know because I'm
      the one who made the game, but I didn't create the font.\r\n\r\nI made it using
      an IDE called Game Maker and thought that it was a standard, widely available
      font.  However, I'm starting to suspect that I was wrong about that.  I'm trying
      to find more information in their forums as well."

  body: I think that might be the old Windows generic serif font. It was a sort of
    primitive outline font. I remember seeing it in PageMaker running on Windows 2.0.

    that the version of Windows that ran on those computers that had stone tablets
    instead of keyboard and mouse?"

  body: "The screen was orange and black, as I recall. There were only two screen
    fonts--a serif and a sans serif. You could use any font that you could print--Century
    Schoolbook, Helvetica, etc.--but the generic font would be used on screen, adopting
    the proportions of the font you wanted (sort of like the substitute font in PDFs).
    NQWYSIWYG.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the serif font looked a lot like the font in Daniel's
    screen shot above."

  body: Yes it looks like the type from many dot matrix printers and Windows 3.X.
    In Windows it was a plotter font so only the outline was drawn - hence the holes.
    And that would be as far as I remember of course.

  body: Times New Roman is from 1931, digital versions going back to the seventies
    at least. The font I'm thinking of (and maybe the font you are inquiring about)
    was/is and early computer font on Windows from the eighties. Probably the same
    one Claus is talking about.

  body: "I have this font on my WinXP machine. It is indeed a bitmap font. It is named
    Roman.fon and appears identical to your image.\r\n\r\nThis and several other installed
    .fon files have 1991-1992 Microsoft copyrights. Since it seems highly unlikely
    that Roman.fon comes with WinXP, the only source I can think of is a Game Boy
    emulator for the PC that I installed for my son."

    was a part of Windows 95.
