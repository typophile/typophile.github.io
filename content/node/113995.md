body: "Hello,\r\nI'm drawing a conceptual font were the upper case is depending on
  the lower case. I have made alternative glyphs for zero\u2013nine, so they will
  work with the same principle as the letters, A\u2013Z and a\u2013z. \r\nBut in the
  InDesign glyph window the name of the alternative \"zero\" becomes \"NULL\" which
  makes it hard to find/understand. \r\nThe forms of the characters only makes sense
  when they are together.\r\n\r\nSo, is it possible to name the alternative zero (today
  named zero.alt1 in FLS) so it turns up in the InDesign glyph window as something
  related to zero? Like zero.alt1?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nAndreas"

    a feature (e.g. SALT, CALT, \u2026) and then also assign these features to AALT
    (\u201CAll Alternates\u201D).\r\nThen in InDesign the user gets a drop-down menu
    from the base glyph to access all available alternates for the base glyph. "

    wife's first reaction was: Have you really done this, is it inspiread by something,
    i've seen it before. SI think she was thinking of the typography on the Dylan
    poster by M. Glaser.\r\n\r\nMy question to this forum: is it a copy of something,
    myself can't remember anything that could have inspired me to do it, except my
    first thought?\r\nI had a clear thought, one letter is forced to work with another
    letter to become understandable... \r\n\r\n/Andreas"
