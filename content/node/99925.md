body: "No idea where we stand in the implementation of descriptive names for Stylistic
  Sets in applications.\r\nBut here's a question anyway:\r\n\r\nAs far as I know there
  are no specs on where in the naming tables to put them. Any name table ID can be
  chosen.\r\nHere I also see a major reason why no one bothers to implement them because
  they don't know where to look.\r\n\r\nAre there any conventions yet on ID ranges?"

  body: No conventions are needed because a Feature Table can point, via its FeatureParams
    field, at a specific name ID. See the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#ssxx"
    target="_blank">feature tag registry</a> which also mentions which name IDs may
    be used.

  body: "Okay, so given an FDK code snippet like below, will the FeatureParams field
    that you mentioned automatically point to the right name ID, given that in this
    code I don\u2019t even point out name IDs?\r\nIn other words: Is this all code
    that is necessary?\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature ss04 {\r\n# Stylistic Set 4\r\n  featureNames
    {\r\n    name 1 \"Alternate german lowercase sz\";\r\n    name 3 \"Alternate german
    lowercase sz\";\r\n  };\r\n}ss04;\r\n</code>"

    else know of one that does?

  body: I would not assume any correlation between the data being in Adobe fonts and
    support in Adobe applications. Adobe has had optical size data in OpenType fonts
    for over a decade now, and it is still unsupported by any Adobe application.
