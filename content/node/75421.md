body: "There's a fast-food restaurant in Brooklyn, NY. It's called Roll 'N' Roaster
  and has been there for as long as I can remember. It's an eyesore and hasn't changed
  it's aesthetic since AT LEAST the 80s when they released their one and only commercial
  (as far as I know, I'm only 21). Anyway, their main selling item are their cheeseburgers
  and their roast beef sandwiches with cheese. As a matter of fact, you can \"put
  cheez on anything you pleez!\" \r\n\r\nAnyway, I want to rebrand the whole place
  (starting with the logo.) I want it to look like a high-class restaurant, but keep
  the attitude that makes it a neighborhood landmark (they call themselves the \"not-so-fast
  fast-food restaurant.)\r\n\r\nI've never had any real-world critiques outside of
  school, so it would be great if you all could drop some knowledge on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Roasters4_5220.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Roasters2_4265.jpg]\r\n\r\nYeah,
  that's a little hamburger there in the negative space, in case you couldn't see
  it already."

  body: Hmm, I have to admit, I see it now, too. I'm going to try to find a way to
    get rid of those "legs." Maybe putting the symbol in a box?

  body: "That's true, I had the two R's before. I copied and flipped them in order
    to make the square, obviously. The only thing would be that they make lopsided
    buns (just using 2.) I could just get rid of the tails on two of the R's...\r\n\r\nNeeds
    some more tinkering, I suppose. A suggestion worth pursuing, though."

    it annoyed me once I got up in there.

    logo is a great suggestion, but it still doesn''t say "come here instead of McDonald''s"
    to me. '

  body: The way you are selling the logo suggests that this is a rotisserie type restaurant,
    not a cheeseburger and roast beef type place.  I think you have to be careful
    not to design above the client base for the establishment, because you risk loosing
    some of the people that have kept it open for so long. Just my thoughts.
