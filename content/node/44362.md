  vision for a new typeface. On paper it's quite 'plump', so I could easily start
  with a bold or black design in FontLab. It's my understanding (mainly from other
  threads) that to easily interpolate a family I should make a bold and a light. This
  design may well suit that. Is this an appreciable intention?\r\n\r\nUntil now I've
  not really been able to visualise things that aren't a medium/in-the-middle weight.
  Working from the outside in sounds a bit perverse!\r\n\r\nAny thoughts warmly appreciated."

    You will probably find out that the interpolated regular needs some corrections.\r\n\r\nThe
    other problem, however, is that during the process of making test printouts and
    modifying your font(s) you will probably end up making the \"same\" corrections
    to the bold and the light, especially when you are testing your regular, so you
    have double the work. This has happened to me and I have wasted lots of time.
    That is the only reason why I now tend to develop the regular first."

  body: "Why perverse? \r\n\r\nAlso, what happens with type is that you always have
    to make small adjustments. \r\n\r\nI suggest that you work from a med to a bold
    or a bold to the med & then go to a light. The chances of the medium being really
    good based on the design that arrives from a interpolated light & bold seem small.
    \r\n\r\nBut to be fair I don't know this per se. I haven't done it yet myself.
    But type process are not direct - they always need tweakage.\r\n\r\nI am sure
    other folks here can say more about it."

  body: "I'm well prepared for tweakage. The whole process is the tweekage of minutiae!\r\n\r\nI
    only meant it was a <em>bit</em> perverse. I guess I mean that I would usually
    visualise the regular weight, as that's probably both easier and the most used
    in a family. Designing the bold (as I'm currently doing) is fine, as I've already
    drawn it it all out on paper anyway, but I need to visualise the regular while
    I'm going. I just think the regular weight is supremo and therefore the one most
    likely to require direct design attention.\r\n\r\nAny tips on the whole MM process
    would be most welcome."

  body: When sketching out characters on paper, I usually find myself drawing a glyph
    that is too bold for regular and too light for bold... :o) And I always find it
    hard process to get to the "right" weights from that intermediate one ('cuz that's
    the one I visualised internally, and I find it hard to deviate i.e. make it "inferior"
    in my internal eyes :-) ).

  body: "My sketches turned out very bold. In, fact they're exactly as you say --
    too bold for regular and too light for bold! I'm not tracing them though, but
    drawing them from my reference drawings in FontLab. I'm deliberately making them
    consistent and more bold at that stage.\r\n\r\nYou're kind of onto what I mean.
    It's a job letting the 'vision' mould itself to weights other than the drawn original.\r\n\r\nInevitably,
    as I'm digitising my drawings things are changing. The process is very interesting.
    Here's my 3, sketched and digitised. The contrast on everything has been reduced
    now I'm in FontLab.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/three_4356.png]"

    thinner than the horizontals looks weird - as does the whole weight distribution
    on the digitized version, to my eye.\r\n\r\nEben wrote: <cite>The chances of the

    has generally been the opposite. If the masters are really good, the middle interpolations
    will often be even better. If there's something wrong in the middle, it's almost
    always indicative of something wrong in one or more masters. (The exception being
    if you're working with masters that are too extreme, and then you have to do something
    more complicated to compensate.)\r\n\r\nThat being said, the question of how early
    in the design one switches to an MM basis is a tricky one. If sweeping changes
    are going to happen, then yes, making those changes in several masters is more
    work. But working directly on a \"regular\" weight when one is ultimately going
    to have a light and a bold is also extra work. Different people have different
    ideas on this score, even folks who have a lot of experience working on MM based
    designs. Personally, I favor going to MM early, at least the weight axis, but
    some of my colleagues work differently.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I began my first family with a medium bold and then did a light and a bold
    plus some tweens. In my second family, I started with a light and then went to
    a bold plus tweens. Since then, I have begun with a black and a regular. My point
    is that you can go any way with it. The advantage of trying several scenarios
    is that you learn something different each way. There is nothing perverse or magical
    in it, it is just a method to begin. The key is not to feel compelled to keep
    using your first attempt even if it is a Master. Try it and learn what happens
    when you interpolate. It will help you with the next face you begin. I don't think
    there is a one and best methodology.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    \"normal conditions\" it's not a problem. But....\r\n\r\nI had an example of a
    case where I needed the design space to be as big as possible, using intermediate
    masters was not practical, plus I needed the axis values to relate linearly to
    measurable attributes of the font. So I allowed the bold condensed master to turn
    essentially inside out, and defined a \"no fly zone\" near that master where the
    instances would be no good. This allowed me to expand the design space a bit.\r\n\r\nThis
    really begs for a more visual explanation. I have some slides on this, but they
    are intended to go with an interactive demo using the font. Maybe I can get to
    cleaning this up or recording a video version some time.... No promises, but I'll
    add it to my list of future blog topics.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    light, you'll get ignored. Neither is conducive for starting a family.
