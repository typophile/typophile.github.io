  equipment. I want to design a logotype based on some kind of racing typography but
  because this is something unusual for me (i'm more into DIN-style typo) i didn't
  find enough fonts which would match my idea because it should be something motoristic
  (racing style - see attachment) on one hand but also modern (designed like eg. http://subtype.org/
  and these modern looking fonts) as well... \r\n\r\nI would be more than grateful
  for your suggestions. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\ngonee\r\n\r\n\r\n"
