I have just produced Nadyezhda SL One, a special version of the Bitstream Vera Mono font, originally designed by Jim Lyles. 

This font is intended for testing of OpenType Layout features support in an application. Using a special test string (see README.TXT included in the ZIP archive for details), the user can selectively turn on and off OpenType features in the application's UI and observe which OpenType feature tags are being applied to the text. Each feature includes one lookup that substitutes two particular Latin lowercase letters with a special glyph that shows the feature tag associated with that feature. All lookups are GSUB LookupType 4 (ligature) lookups and are registered in the Latin (latn) default languagesystem. 

The font implements all OpenType feature tags registered in the OpenType specification version 1.4, as well as two unregistered tags: "ss21" and "ss22". 

Note that many OpenType Layout features should not be implemented this way in real-world fonts. For example, the "nukt" (Nukta form) feature only makes sense when registered in an Indic script, not in the Latin script. Many of these features should be applied automatically in certain language/script contexts by the OpenType Layout engine, and this font is not suitable for testing such behavior. Also, the recommended implementation for many features is to include positioning lookups rather than substitution lookups, and this font also does not fulfil these expectations. 

Nonetheless, the font is useful for testing issues such as:
* Which OpenType features are <a href="http://typophile.com/node/31140">active by default</a> in my application? 
* When triggering a particular UI item for applying a certain feature, is the expected feature being actually applied?
* Does my application have human-readable UI labels for all possible OpenType features?
* Are the human-readable UI labels for OpenType features localized into other languages in a sensible way?

"Nadyezhda" is Russian for "Hope". Along with "Vera" (which was also the original name for this typeface, and is Russian for "Faith") and with "Lyubov" ("Love"), they form the three Biblical virtues, and rank among the most popular Russian female given names. 

The font is available FREE OF CHARGE and is released under a generous Bitstream license, allowing derivative works (as long as "Bitstream" or "Vera" are not in the names), and full redistribution (so long as they are not *sold* by themselves). See COPYRIGHT.TXT included in the ZIP archive for license details.
