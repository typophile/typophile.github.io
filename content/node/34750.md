body: I like The Serif Bold, but am looking to use in a job that needs a bit more
  of a 'friendly' feel. Some of the Underware fonts look really nice, but are just
  too cutesy for my needs. Any ideas? Thanks!

  body: I thought it was some form of <a href="http://www.linotype.com/44236/chaparral-family.html">Chaparral</a>
    at first, but the k and the A aren't quite right. Maybe they had it customised?
