    searching for a really how-to what i'm looking for is something like how to draw
    a sans-serif, what is a beautiful type that kind of stuff, theoretic stuff see
    what i mean? Where do i start doing my types... something like that.\r\nOf course
    i know that there isn't much a formula for a well done type but something that
    helps me through it.\r\nFor example... i would like now to do a pixel font. What
    steps should i take?\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound & visual"

    enthusiasm, as well as getting you started on design ideas. His "Learn FontLab
    Fast" is another good tool.
