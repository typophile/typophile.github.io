body: I&#39;m creating flashcards for a &#34;name that typeface&#34; game. The idea
  is the same as &#34;name that tune&#34; in that the teams will be allowed to say
  how many glyphs they need to name that typeface. If you were to choose 8 glyphs,
  which would you choose? <BR>

  body: 'Hey, great idea! <BR>So you need to sequence the glyphs in ascending &#34;potential
    distinctiveness&#34;, right? Like lc &#34;el&#34; could be the first one and lc
    &#34;g&#34; the 8th. An &#34;early&#34; candidate might be lc &#34;h&#34; and
    a late one UC &#34;Q&#34;. You could also throw in extended-Latin stuff, like
    an &#34;a-ogonek&#34; as 6th or something. So three more for the middle, maybe
    &#34;f&#34; for 5th and &#34;J&#34; for 3rd and &#34;y&#34; for 4th? <BR> <BR>So
    I got: lhJyfaQg <BR> <BR>&#62; I should add that the choices are limited to 4
    uppercase and 4 lowercase or figures.  <BR> <BR>Why? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
    another idea: have a speed test too, where people get to say how many seconds
    they need to identify a font, and you flash a pangram for increasing durations.

    <BR>That way the [alert] competitor can more quickly locate key glyphs. Although
    at the beginning &#40;very short exposure&#41; it&#39;s the familiarity with the
    overall texture of a font that will allow an ultra-quick ID. BTW, this is a place

  body: if any of you remember the game NAME THAT TUNE i was thinking along those
    lines. and as hrant pointed out i think the letters shown should start with most
    difficult and become easier. for instance, imagine Nick v. Thomas ... Nick says
    &#34;I can name that typeface in 8 characters.&#34; And then Nick says, &#34;oh
    yeah! well I can name that typeface in 7 characters.&#34; And then Thomas says,
    &#34;I don&#39;t believe it. Name that typeface.&#34; At this point we would show
    seven characters &#40;out of the 8&#41;, leaving the easiest character out of
    the showing. It will be done on teams though, with each team having a leader.

  body: If it&#39;s always the same set of characters, the &#34;easiest&#34; character
    will vary from face to face. And heaven help one if the typeface is a sans serif.
    <BR> <BR>Or is that the point, that one never knows how difficult it&#39;s going
    to be? <BR> <BR>The game would be more interesting for everyone &#40;audience
    in particular&#41; if the characters representing a typeface were those that were
    most peculiar to that particular face. <BR> <BR>Tiff, can I be on your team, pleeeease?
    Or don&#39;t you get to play if you&#39;re the strict English quizmistress?

  body: I think it might be slightly different for different typefaces.  <BR> <BR>But
    I will say that &#39;a&#39; and &#39;g&#39; are usually dead giveaways. <BR> <BR>I
    like &#39;n&#39; or &#39;h&#39; for difficult but not impossible. &#39;l&#39;
    alone would be pretty tough. Many &#39;o&#39;s as well. <BR> <BR>Caps? &#39;Q&#39;
    is usually a giveaway. Sometimes &#39;R&#39; and &#39;A&#39;. &#39;M&#39; would
    be an in-between. &#39;H&#39; and &#39;O&#39; would be usually tougher, all by
    themselves. <BR> <BR>The more regular and the fewer features, the less distinctive
    = harder. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: Will you always present the same set of letters for each contest? Will they
    always be in the same order? It is easier to strategize if both of these things
    are true. <BR> <BR>Is this &#34;open book&#34;? Should I plan on packing my specimens

    strict english &#40;not really&#41; quizmistress. you are right, i don&#39;t really
    get to play, which is really sad, but maybe if i can build a template others will
    volunteer to create some sheets as well.

  body: 'I think having a fixed set/sequence of characters: <BR>1&#41; helps the organizer&#40;s&#41;.
    <BR>2&#41; promotes strategizing &#40;like Kent said&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    think there should be teams - there should be a qualification round &#40;maybe
    show a couple of complete 8-glyph sets to everybody, get them to write and hand
    in their answers, and the first 8 corrent respondents qualify&#41;, and then have
    a pairwise elimination tree, with quarter and semi finals, and a final. <BR> <BR>As
    for closed/open book, one big advantage of meatspace versus virtual interaction
    is that you can prevent people from checking references, so I think you should
    take advantage of that. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, here&#39;s another option: instead
    of asking &#34;how many glyphs do you need to identify the font&#34;, show the
    glyphs slowly &#40;like 5 seconds each&#41; and the first correct respondent wins.
    If the first respondent is incorrect, the other guy has until the time limit to
    answer correctly, otherwise there&#39;s a rematch. <BR> <BR>Audience members shouting
    out answers will be hung by their finials. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    multiple responses and just take the first correct one. <BR> <BR>BTW, the Name
    That Tune format only really makes sense if you give some intro clue to each font
    &#40;which is what they did on the game show&#41;. That&#39;s what allows the
    contestants to gamble well with how many glyphs they need. <BR> <BR>The Name That
    Tune format is more work for you, and slower to perform, but more sophisticated
    than a brute force speed test. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    I stand by the basic concept. Name that face in with as few glyphs as possible.
