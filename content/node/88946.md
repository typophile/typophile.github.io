body: I really love the look of Garamond, but it feels too delicate for serious academic
  work. Are there any alternatives that are both readable and strong with a clean
  design?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

  body: I use Sabon Next (which is a true Garamond) in all of my academic papers.  It's
    lovely, and the OpenType format is easy to use in XeTeX.
