body: "Ligatures are typographic finesses for connoisseurs and occur where two or
  more graphemes are joined to a single glyph. They help preventing the gap between
  characters, which disturb the reading flow. For a long time ligatures have been
  reserved to old style fonts, but recently they are experiencing a revival also through
  sans serif typefaces. The font family Sintesi Sans is equipped with a large amount
  of ligatures, much more complete than the usual combinations between the minuscules
  \u201Cf\u201D \u201CI\u201D, and \u201Cl\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of the modern
  digital media still does not allow a consequent use of ligatures on all platforms.
  Thank to an innovative approach Sintesi Sans manages indeed to ensure an almost
  consistent appearance of the font, in the typographic cultivated artworks on paper
  as well as on the web and Office applications. This has been made possible through
  a special metric and kerning strategy, which allows also the use of the elegant,
  classical form of the minuscule \u201Cf\u201D with large arch, which otherwise would
  still be prerogative of serif fonts.\r\n\r\nSintesi Sans contains also a very complete
  and specifically tailored range of numberings and arrows.\r\nWorth mentioning is
  the suitable italic. Thanks to its moderate inclination it may be convenient in
  more ways than just for emphasizing purposes.\r\nYou will find a free trial version
  of the font Sintesi Sans under [[http://www.sintesi.ch]].\r\n\r\nExhibit typographic
  knowledge, with Sintesi Sans."
