  medical center, and I'd like to choose a typeface that has some historical link
  to hospitals or medicine. I'll need typefaces for paragraphs of text as well as
  headings, and any references would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJeff"

    printed, over decades from ca. 1880."

  body: "Scotch Modern in a nice font, but I'm not sure Jeff why you want a font with
    historical links to medicine. I could understand if you were making an old-fashioned-looking
    medicine label, but a modern lab website? \r\n\r\nI could see using them in the
    logo \u2014 maybe, if that projects the image your lab wants to convey (which
    I doubt) \u2014\_but for text fonts I'd think you'd want fonts that were more
    associated with a modern scientific lab."

  body: I feel like hospitals and clinics always seem to use Optima for signage. But
    that would look very dated today.

  body: "Jeff, if you don't mind me questioning your reasoning just a bit, I'm not
    so sure that an obscure historical tie-in between medicine and a typeface would
    be noticed or appreciated by anyone viewing the website. You might, on occasion,
    have the opportunity to tell someone that you were using the same typeface as,
    say, JAMA used in the 1890s. That person would then nod his or her head in appreciation,
    but really, no one else will ever notice.\r\n\r\nMuch more important is using
    a typeface that reads well on a computer, smartphone or tablet display and that
    looks professional in a way that seems appropriate for the scientific lab in question.
    To me, a nice, clean sans-serif would make a more professional, scientific and
    forward-thinking impression than a typeface that might have been commonly used
    in the 1800s. I definitely wouldn't compromise readability for the sake of style
    \u2014 for headlines, maybe, but definitely not for text."

    books uses Myriad Condensed for its book covers.\r\nMany of the viewers of your
    website would have seen some of these books and could associate Myriad with reputable
    medical information. \r\nDon"
