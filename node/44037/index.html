<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished a <a href="http://www.klim.co.nz/custom_hardys.php">custom typeface</a> for the Hardys wine range, owned by Constellation Wines Australia. You might be interested to see it, it&rsquo;s quite different to what I normally draw &amp; what&rsquo;s currently fashionable. Your thoughts are welcome, as always!</p>

<p>I have noticed that after being immersed in work on the italic, the roman looks slanted and wrong.</p>
<p>So admittedly my eyes&ndash;or rather brain&ndash;may be distorted from looking at classic proportions.</p>

<p>Maybe this is the problem. I really can&rsquo;t put my finger on it, but maybe the small serifs with the wide  style feels awkward to me.</p>
<p>Ah yes, maybe that&rsquo;s it. The original Latin style has big honking triangular serifs, right?

<p>Bill &ndash; I think this makes an interesting case study.

<p>Kris, I don&rsquo;t know if this is what you mean, but I do think it is possible to have extremely even color but still have a lot of &lsquo;flavor&rsquo; in the shapes. The &lsquo;Moderno&rsquo; that is now the Typophile display font achieves this. In other words, it is possible to be &lsquo;smooth&rsquo; in a certain sense, but not bland and average. My concern on this font of yours&ndash;and not others  of yours like National or Meta Serif Black&ndash;is with uneven color. While I greatly respect the &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; of others commenting in this thread, the fact is that Tiffany noticed something, too. I think that means my reaction is not just a result of my looking too much at other styles.</p>

<p>So if the &lsquo;e&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; etc were narrowed, the colour would be more even for you? How even does it need to be? Is 100% &ldquo;even&rdquo; the most desirable thing to have? I think that &lsquo;evening&rsquo; out the widths would kill the spirit.</p>

<p>Well, I admit this is my pet theory, but I think that in order to look even you have to make the letters more different, not less different&ndash;but in specific ways. So it&rsquo;s not a matter of evening widths; it is a matter of their relationships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m can&rsquo;t tell you physically what it is, but I think I can see it when I put a letter between others, and play with its width and weights of strokes. I think it has to do with the overall density of the black (or white) within the advance width, but also it is affected by the distribution of weight in the letter.</p>
<p>It ends up with there being a relationship among widths within a design, where making some too narrow or wide in relation to the other disturbs the rhythm of the way they set, and makes words look not as good, even though the individual letters may look good.</p>
<p>It is related all the readability stuff I&rsquo;ve been blathering about on typophile. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll very soon be able to give you a detailed illustration of how I&rsquo;ve carried it out, but I think there are a lot of typefaces that do this quite well&ndash;including some of your own.</p>
<p>Kent, might you put up a scan of those you were referencing?</p>

<p>I think some of what you&rsquo;re talking about is also a function of different environments &ndash; essentially display vs. text. I&rsquo;m guessing that the Hardy&rsquo;s commission was a one-size-fits-all and was probably skewed toward display, since I imagine packaging will be a primary use.</p>
<p>I think the even color you&rsquo;re looking for can also be a matter of distribution of weight as much as relative proportion. In a &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; style like Hardys there are some real challenges when trying to get good display qualities. The way that weight is carried on the shoulder of the arch letters (which tend to retain more oldstyle characteristics) vs. the weight around the &ldquo;corners&rdquo; of round letters (which are more upright in angle) can be a tricky balance to achieve while still retaining the style&rsquo;s essential qualities. Keeping contrast crisp for display exacerbates the problem, while reducing contrast for more sturdy text performance tends to ameliorate the issue.</p>
<p>If I get a chance later, perhaps I can get up a scan of some English Latins. But don&rsquo;t hold your breath. I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re that germane.</p>

<p>I agree; that&rsquo;s what I was attempting to say above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way that weight is carried on the shoulder of the arch letters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s one key feature of a type design. I&rsquo;m not clear about the point you&rsquo;re making, though.</p>
<p>In Baskerville, the stress is vertical, and the weight of the shoulders much reduced compared to old style. This goes together as both are a natural result of using the pointed pen&ndash;as I learned in the thread on that issue.</p>
<p>In Caslon&rsquo;s designs, the vertical o contradicts the slanted stress of the b d etc; its stress doesn&rsquo;t follow the rules of the broad pen held at a constant angle. This variation is a characteristic of what Bringhurst calls &lsquo;Baroque&rsquo; faces, of which Caslon is an example.</p>
<p>I agree with you that in a display face you can contradict good text rhythm for the sake of a gain in artistic or decorative effect. But I don&rsquo;t see the gain here. For example, in Hardy bold, I don&rsquo;t see the same problems in rhythm as in the regular. I don&rsquo;t see why the regular couldn&rsquo;t be the same&hellip;</p>

<p>OK. I didn&rsquo;t get that.</p>
<p>I thought you were saying that the relative widths of some letters &ndash; e a, for instance &ndash; were too wide and caused uneven color. My point was that it might not be so much their relative width as choices in how the weight is handled.</p>
<p>I can imagine pulling just a little more weight around the lower left, 7:00-8:00 region on the a c and e, for instance, without adjusting their relative width, and perhaps achieving more of what I think you&rsquo;re seeking.</p>
<p>The second part of my point was that doing this will subtly affect the nature of the stress in the glyphs. This will be negligible in a low contrast, text environment; but in a higher contrast, higher style, display environment, it will be more apparent and the choice of where to strike that balance may be different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to say whether in this case the Regular could be made more like the Bold in this way without losing something. One would have to try it out.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, both weights and widths are involved. I just first noticed the a, that it pushed itself to my attention a little more, which is not so good. My first guess was that it is too wide. In general to improve color and rhythm, is a matter of playing with both weights and widths, and hopefully combination of them ends up working.</p>
<p>Kris, I wish I had a comprehensive theory, but I don&rsquo;t. I just have ideas, which I apply by trial and error. Some of the ideas are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Even color is paramount in the lower case of a text face, because uneven color constitutes &lsquo;noise&rsquo; that interferes with readability. The idea is that the only thing that should be different are the shapes, and not the <em>apparent</em> darkness or lightness of any parts. This goal can&rsquo;t always be realized, as with the L an r, but closer is better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Caps, however, don&rsquo;t have to be even color with the lower case, since the caps are supposed to stick out as markers. Maybe for German even color between caps and lower case is more important&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Even color does involve the same black/white density within the advance width, in the x-height region, I suspect. The counters need some kind of harmony, but it&rsquo;s not a matter of strict equality, either in width or area. I can&rsquo;t characterize it more precisely, at least not yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often achieving even color often means more variation in among characters&ndash;a design that is less &lsquo;modular.&rsquo; I have ideas on how to do this for the design I have been working on, and will put up an illustration after I finish the text size&ndash;I hope very soon!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a practical matter, as I work I compare on the screen the same words in my design and another typeface I think is very even. My main standard has been Adobe Garamond, but I have used others, including recently Kent&rsquo;s Whitman, which I think is admirable in that respect. It probably helps to have a design that is in the same general category, but the idea is <em>not</em> to match the design, but the evenness of the look.</p>

<p>Some tricky stuff is going on with vertically divided letters, like a e s A E S. Generally, when you divide a space, the top half is going to be vertically smaller, and often narrower as well. That is often going to affect the counter, or how wide it will be. Generally, the whole thing seems to get narrower to look right; a&rsquo;s are usually narrower than n&rsquo;s or o&rsquo;s, I believe.</p>

<p>That all sounds fairly straight forward. But if you&rsquo;ve been using Adobe Garamond (!) as a &lsquo;spacing standard&rsquo; then you&rsquo;re bound to be a bit sensitive/biased against other styles.</p>

<p>As I said, even color is a product not only of &ldquo;spacing&rdquo;, but also of width and weight distribution of the glyphs&ndash;aspects of glyph design. I usually have several different styles open to compare mine to, not just Adobe Garamond. And I&rsquo;ve not just re-spaced, but re-drawn in response to this comparative process.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think only old styles can have good color. Chronicle is an example of a recent &lsquo;Scotch&rsquo; that I find strikingly well done as far as even color. And as I have said, I find Whitman also very good in that respect, and it also is not an old style. Moderno, now in our headings, is a display face, but it also is very even&ndash;even without kerning, which is pretty impressive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stefan,</p>
<p>Thanks. There&rsquo;s another important factor here, which is not my theory but that of David Kindersley. He wrote that there is a &lsquo;visual center&rsquo; to a character, and that visual center needs to be equidistant from the side bearings to look balanced within words. The visual center is something like if the letter were solid, and you put it on a board, the visual center would be near where a fulcrum would have it balance. Except that the left and right extremes of the letter have more weight&ndash;Kindersley used the square of the area in a column slice of the letter (square of its weight, if solid), rather than just its area (weight).</p>
<p>There is another factor noted by others, which is that the spaces between letters need to look visually even. But the need for visual centering and for visually even spacing between different letters don&rsquo;t necessarily work together, so not every design will space well as far as even color.</p>
<p>Kindersley gives the interesting example of the L, and the often heavy serif at the end of the leg. What this heavy serif does is to shift the visual center of the L to the right. And that means that if you space the left side bearing of the L similar to the I, the L will look visually less unbalanced than it would without the serif. It still leaves a hole, unless you have an all caps setting very widely spaced, but it helps.</p>
<p>Kindersley&rsquo;s theory doesn&rsquo;t capture all that is going on visually, but it is a very interesting insight, I think. It shows that how you distribute the weight in the glyph affects how even the color will be, and how you should space it.</p>

<p>I am at work – so briefly.
I do like and share for myself (although I explain it in my theories in other words) the state that was made about the visual center. Think this hits the point. One of my most important words is rhythm. A thing that in the most digital faces is inexistent - to say it a bit provocative - because of the kerning work. I think a brillant typeface has to be designed in a way that it needs not to be kerned at all, at least in my eyes. It can work with a visual center.</p>

<p>Than there is also another point I find important. That is the fact that for example in storic typefaces like Jensons the outlines of the letters aren’t so smooth. They offer the other letters points to attach themselves so that the rhythm is carried on more easily. Jensons spaces aren’t too perfect (and they are wide for todays opinion) but they work perfect! Nobody will dare to kern Jensons letters. I at least won’t.</p>

<p>In general, I am all for continuing a thread even with change of topic. Typophile is like the Talmud&ndash;a record of discussions&ndash;in that many of the most interesting discussions have little or nothing to do with the original topic. That is fine with me.</p>
<p>However, in this case, this thread was mainly about honoring Kris&rsquo;s work. I felt badly about introducing a sour note, but I felt that the issue I raised was important enough to raise anyway. But I didn&rsquo;t want to go on too long about it.</p>
<p>Stefan, I think Kindersley would probably agree with you. In his scheme, all caps setting should ideally be &lsquo;tracked&rsquo; widely enough that the R can get its full ideal advance width and spacing. If it has to be tighter, then it is just tracked closer, everything else should be kept the same, and it is better to overlap RA and KA, etc, rather than spacing them wider than the rest. But I think, contra Kindersley, it is questionable whether the best spacing stays the same at all tracking numbers.</p>

<p>Yes, there are a lot of details I love too. My favorite is the dynamic acute accent.</p>
<p>Looking again at the word &ldquo;Sauvingon,&rdquo; maybe what disturbed me also is the tight kerning of the S to the a. I am finding now as I am kerning that caps look better when they stand off a bit from the lower case characters. They, being broader, want a little bit more space than the lower case letters, so the kerning needs to be a compromise between lc and upper case spacing. By now, Kris has more experience at this than I, but that&rsquo;s how it looks to me. (The C in Cuvee looks too tight to me also.)</p>

<p>That can be true with smaller x-height fonts or with caps that are much bolder than lower case but not so true in other cases. I think Kris has hit it spot on with Hardy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right that this has an impact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked in Mac McGrew&rsquo;s American Metal Typefaces and saw these Latins:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Latins_4646.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m seeing something I think similar to what inspired Kris, and I&rsquo;m getting a better picture. I don&rsquo;t like these &lsquo;Latins&rsquo; either, as to me the proportions are ungainly, including the wide a. Kris&rsquo;s rendering of the style is a big improvement on these to my eyes. But I just don&rsquo;t like the style.</p>
<p>So this may be part of my own antipathy to a lot of Victorian styles. With a lot of exceptions I tend to feel: 18th century&ndash;good. 19th Century&ndash;bad. 20th century first half&ndash;good. 20th century second half, pre-digital&ndash;not so good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi William,</p>
<p>I tried to show with my pictures effects that letters show if they were looked upon with an out of focus. It becomes clearer what is meant by the optical ‘center’ of a letter. Or a thing that I call ryhtm. If the ‘a’ in the example (its design intuitively decentered to the right as we all do it day by day) is put out of focusand then used a filter that interpolates the remaining colour other forms come to the surface like these elliptical ones on the second picture. In theory the fields A an B have to have the same amount of blackness.
Second we see the optical center of the new curves pushed to the right almost simmetrical to the center line. So when we slightly may close our eyes over a text this is what has to remain as rythm giving parts. But I see its too much explaining for a thing that has to be done in design by intuition..
But I found it curious to see nevertheless.
Finally we have to be aware that when we design our curves we design also these hidden ones as well, don’t we?</p>
<p>Ciao William
see you in some other thread!</p>

<p>It does look much better than the ones I found in Mac McGrew. It is interesting that this more monoline version seems to work better with the stretched letter forms.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, a lot of Marian Bantje&rsquo;s stuff, which I adore, also uses monoline curls&hellip;</p>

<p>I think that your earlier posted Lining Booklet face pulls it off better. Somehow the way the curl on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; makes the counter on the top of the a smaller, so it visually fits better, in spite of being over-wide. Similarly, the top of the &ldquo;e&rdquo; has the side arches pulled in, making it look narrower on top, and visually fit better. I still feel the Lining Booklet has problems, but the way the curls are handled generally give the face a jolly mood, without being saccharine, and that is distinctive and nice.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there are other faces from that era, such as the silent film title faces, which have the curls with a similar mood, but more well proportioned, and work better.</p>
