  might eventually buy more or the whole package. The monthly reports are overloaded
  with hundreds of $00.00-lines (costs a lot of paper when doing accounts).\r\nAlso
  I know that in some cases the give-away helped getting a typeface more polular.
  But then, does it pay off?\r\nAnyone sharing experience with own freefonts-policy?"

  body: "Perhaps it is not that the same people who download the freefonts return
    and buy the paid fonts. It seems to me it is more about how the free fonts may
    generate traffic to your site and cause a buzz which livens up the marketing ears
    out in web land. I personally feel that many (if not most?) free font downloaders
    are only interested in getting things for free.\r\nThe point of free font marketing
    is positioning yourself in the market so that you get brand recognition and can
    play the hits game better. Resellers like MyFonts use hits and sales to push type
    vendors work further up the food chain.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "The only person I know of who seems to be selling lots of fonts that have
    appetizers is Jos. Personally I think that this has more to do with his designs
    being good than with giving away a few free weights. And I don\u2019t see many
    users clamoring for the giveaways\u2014the people out there asking for free fonts
    are open-source pundits and web designers who want a lot more than just a free
    weight here and there. I think that it makes more sense to try and market by offering
    something people really want. Sell cheap web font licenses on Kernest. Offer heavy
    discounts to noncommercial users and students who can\u2019t afford or can\u2019t
    justify an expensive family for a single project with no commercial return."

    So, it's a different kind of value. Any price above 0 will give you more information

  body: "I wish the MyFonts guys (Nick?) would chime in and clarify this for me.  It
    appears to me that a free download of a font counts to the database as a transaction
    in such a way that it counts as a sale in their \"Hottest Fonts\",  \"Hot New
    Fonts\", and  \"Biggest Sellers\" algorithm.  The point is, if you put a free
    font as part of a larger family and let the free fonters of the world download
    it ad nauseam, the zero dollar sale counts as a sale none the less and boosts
    the type family high up on the lists. Granted, the free fonts net zero dollars
    but they do push visibility high enough and long enough that the rest of the family
    shows up as being \"Popular\" as well.\r\nIt is like buying a balloon, you don't
    pay for the air but nobody sees the balloon very well without it.  Out of sight,
    out of mind.\r\n\r\nThis does not work for everyone.  You still have to have high
    quality desirable type for sale. The people who pay for type are discerning and
    won't buy crap just because it is high on some list.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    MyFonts people would step up and straighten me out on this.\r\n\r\nLike I said
    above, it only works when the quality of the type is up to the task. Your average
    Joe font marketed in this way will go nowhere but the quality and appeal far above
    average work of a Jos will rise to the task.\r\n\r\nThe 50 hot new fonts list
    gives you a 50 day window to move into the longer lasting and more telling \"Best
    Sellers\" list. That is a big leap done by only a few. It also depends on who
    you are marketing to. There are far more hobbyist scrapbookers out there who buy
    cute illustration fonts from MyFonts than large text superfamilies from MyFonts.
    \ The multiuser multi license Superfamily buyers are more likely to buy from a
    Font Beaureau or a FontShop than at MyFonts.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    limited funds for fonts.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself - any font with a free weight
    that was obviously a quality font family, I ended up buying other weights - IF
    each was less than $21. It got my attention. I felt I got a deal.\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    I'd wait til the font was on special at MyFonts. Some never are, of course.\r\n\r\nMuseo,
    Museo Sans, Galette, Paragraph, Paracaps, Tenby, Sovba are the ones I'm thinking
    of. \r\n\r\nI like Cora free weight a lot, but I can't spend $35 each for the
    other weights, so I end up never using it. "

  body: "I would guess it is a function of the demographics of who buys fonts.\r\n\r\nIf
    it is savvy designers on a budget, the answer is probably that free fonts have
    little effect on a purchase at the time of downloading the free font.\r\n\r\nBut
    I agree that free fonts on the level of Museo definitely create a buzz within
    the typography community, which then generates lots of links and promotion on
    typography sites (which is how designers find fonts)."

  body: "A little OT: I've been using the two Museo fonts frequently, now that I have
    several weights.\r\n\r\nMuseo Sans looks so clean and legible as text - I wondered
    why. I had thought the common wisdom was to never use a geometric for text, cause
    it'll \"look like Swiss cheese\" with all those little circles.\r\n\r\nI see now,
    although the \"o\" is a perfect circle, the other rounded letters are slightly
    narrower. So, to my eye, Museo Sans text harmonizes well with other geometric
    display fonts, and doesn't have the \"circle problem\". \r\n\r\nI have learned
    so much from Typophile and MyFonts. Two years ago I used nothing but the OS and
    Adobe fonts I had installed, plus a bunch of free ones of limited usefulness.
    My main interest was illustration and graphics - I was ignorant about the history
    and proper use of type. I never learned anything about typography from the free
    sites.\r\n\r\nNow I'm slowly building a professional font library."
