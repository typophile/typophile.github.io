  the right place so forgive me\r\n\r\nMy question is why when i write a letter in

  same\r\ni cheacked with thoes letters -- xXjt\",--\r\n\r\nin another word what does
  the size 12pt measure if not the X-height?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks you very much\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's the \"Design size\". Originally, it was meant to indicate the lead slug
    height -- in modern parlance, it includes its 'internal leading'. Any extra leading
    would be added manually (and I think original lead type was designed to be used
    without).\r\n\r\nNowadays, it doesn't really denote anything special measurement
    of the font. <em>Especially</em> it does not denote the x-height! Script fonts,
    for example, may have huge capitals (even 'extending outside the glyph box' --
    an effect unable to mimick with lead!), in combination with very tiny lowercase
    characters.\r\n\r\nThe \"12 pt\" you enter is used to scale the font bounding
    box, and it's entirely up to the font designer where and how he put the characters
    inside this."

  body: "first thanks for the fast answer\r\n\r\nbut i am  not sure  i understand
    you very well\r\nfrom what you said there is no true/solid 12pt size\r\nbecause
    i can  make a type that it's 12pt size will actually\r\nbe 10pt size of another
    type. so 12pt size can be all sorts of sizes\r\n\r\nam i right?"

  body: If you measure the printed type from baseline to baseline with zero leading
    (line spacing), then it should be 12 points with 12 point type.

  body: "I believe all the above statements are true.\r\n\r\nIn an average font, the
    cap height is about 70% of the point size, and the x-height is about 50% of the
    point size. But plenty of fonts diverge from the average, occasionally by quite
    a bit.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    size of another type.</cite>\r\n\r\nCorrect. You cannot tell what font size was
    used just by measuring the text you see -- you have to have the exact same font
    for comparison."
