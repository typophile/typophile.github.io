  (although matslof got it bang on ^^) and now I'm wondering if maybe a better match
  can be found than my approximate guess for the font used at the top of the logo.\r\n\r\nThe
  logo in question is here (\"THE KENT SPITFIRE\"):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ks_logo_master_small_6255.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy
  naked-eye research led me to http://www.identifont.com/find?font=CG+Alpin+Gothic+No.+1&q=Go
  but I wonder if it's not instead another one.\r\n\r\nThanks to anyone who gives
  it a shot :)"

  body: Amazing :D Thank you so much! (Identifying that "by eye" was ridiculous, I
    was relying on the K, P and S but they're not exactly ground-breaking in their
    design :) ).
