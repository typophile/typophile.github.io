body: "I am looking for a typeface that looks like its from those travel postcards
  like as in \"Hello from California\"... and the Type usually has picstures in the
  letters.  The typeface doesnt have to pics in it.. but just the basic shape of those
  letters..(so I can put my own pictures in it).\r\n\r\nI tried to find a pic online
  in the last hour and cant come up with a sample image (I apologize).  But if it
  helps... The type usually is usually blocked (maybe even slight perspective on it)
  and curved on the bottom.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nedit.. I found one!"

  body: These postcards are hand drawn and that's still the best way to achieve the
    look. You can fake the effect by starting with a simple sans typeface and use
    software (Illustrator filters, Type Twister) to shape the type. But it will look
    fake.

    Cabarga's books</a> are great for learning how to create special effects in and
    around type. Depending on how detailed and refined you want the final design,
    it's not really too hard, but as Stephen suggests, can look fake. With a little
    extra work it can look fine.\r\n\r\nHere's a quickie... 12 minutes to execute
    including image/photo fills. It uses only the most basic menu commands in Photoshop
    7.0 without touching or tuning type outlines.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/postcard-1.png]"

  body: A bold type face is just the beginning. Those postcards were done by one company
    and were hand drawn. I would start with a bold typeface and make the dimentional
    type by tracing it and working it by hand in illustrator.
