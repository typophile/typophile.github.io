    BORDER=0> ok ok, that&#39;s why I left Engineering and began my life as a designer
    LOL&#40;ouch!&#41;, I remember to read the &#34;99% recognition of the fonts posted&#34;
    somewhere here on this pages. Anyway 15% is more than acceptable and took me forever
    to find a place where I could get some valid font ID&#39;s. Myfonts.com started
    this thing for me, I just couldn&#39;t believe what that site could do with the
    images recognition. BUT nothing beats typophile!
