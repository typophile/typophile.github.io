  body: "Congrats to your grandparents David! My wife and I have been together since
    1969 but that is peanuts compared to 50 years!\r\n\r\n\"Old newspapers prove full-justified
    type is a bad idea.\"\r\n\r\nJustification takes love and care in hot metal. The
    time pressures of a daily newspaper and narrow measures spell trouble. I'll bet
    that the wedding announcement pages were set by apprentices instead of the journeymen
    type setters too. :-)\r\nToday's newspapers are far better looking. Computers
    really make a difference.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I just figured it was a good example of old hot metal typesetting like you
    said, Chris. Not good as in well set, but rather a look into our roots!

  body: "You are right David. I am glad you posted it. I almost had to wash the smeared
    newspaper ink from my hands just seeing your post :-)\r\n\r\nI was actually referring
    to Tiff's post and trying to explain why it was so tough to do a good job in those
    old circumstances.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
