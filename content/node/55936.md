  with a zeal.\r\nHowever, I never hear anything about\r\nCopperplate and it's everywhere.\r\nI
  once was told by a former Professor\r\nthat it's a respected font even though it's\r\noverused.
  Don't get me wrong I like\r\nCopperplate. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Copperplate_3838.gif]"

  body: 'The lack of a true lowercase limits the usefulness of Copperplate, but for
    certain applications it has exactly the right balance of strength and grace. Also,
    it seems to work better than most fonts when set on a curved baseline, as on the
    perimeter of a circle (think Presidential seal). '
