  body: Well, I looked all over Mike&#39;s Bauhaus-style Guide and came up empty.  It
    looks alike to Chalet, in the slanted E crossbar, but those lowercase r&#39;s
    and y&#39;s look custom to me.

    a may have been available in non-digital versions or this may simply be a customization.
    How old is this sample? '

  body: James, you&#39;re right. Sorry to contadict Ryan, but the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html"
    target="_blank">Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide</a> has a sample of ITC Ronda Light
    that shows the alternate &#39;a&#39;. The sample came from the Phil&#39;s Photo
    &#39;Homage to the Alphabet&#39; book of 1985, and those were mostly film types.
    Three weights of it were shown, but I only showed the Light. My other Ronda samples
    were from my own font collection, and apparently were without that &#39;a&#39;.

  body: Wow, Mike, my mistake.  There it is.  I guess it was late and I was skimming
    the guide, I thought I caught everything!  Ah, well, time to go watch Comedy Central
    all day...

  body: Um ... yeah. Sorry I spelled this wrong too. <BR> <BR>It is sad that so many
    of todays digital versions of older fonts don&#39;t contain the alternates. It&#39;s
    kind of like having a pan-and-scan-only copy of a movie when you know this was
    shot in glorious panavision &#40;anamorphic&#41; widescreen. I wonder if anyone
    will bother to include these alternates if these are ever released as Opentype
    fonts. Avante Garde should be first among them!

  body: I&#39;ll second that.  <BR> <BR>One of the font families I&#39;m working on
    is a revival of Phil Martin&#39;s Fotura Biform &#40;a few samples on his site
    <a href="http://mm2000s.net/FoturaLight.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://mm2000s.net/FoturaMedium.jpg"
    target="_blank">here</a>&#41; which he designed from 1969 through 1972. You can
    be sure this will include <b>all</b> the alternate characters, and then some,
    in OpenType format. <BR> <BR>I like your movie analogy. That&#39;s how I feel
    about it, too.
