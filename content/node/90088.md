  be printed on a tabbed divider - reading downward (text facining inward) or reading
  upward (text facing outward)?\r\nMany thanks"

    in a filing cabinet.

    flat on a table \u2014 which is to say, upward. I think oldnick's logic makes
    a similar kind of sense."

  body: "I would prefer them to read with the baseline outwards, because looking over
    the document or binder cover and content in order to read the tabs is awkward,
    especially if it is wiro-bound or a looseleaf folder as the pages will creep out
    to hide the tab.\r\n\r\nTim"
