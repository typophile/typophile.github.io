body: Hi guys - am currently working on logo for a shopping centre in Plymouth, England
  called &#34;Drake Circus&#34; , named after Sir francis Drake &#40;16th Century
  English Naval chap and Explorer if anyone doesn&#39;t know&#41;  <BR> <BR>I am looking
  for a Tudor style script, or something with a handdrawn quality without being naff
  - Something with a bit of character. Am currently using Cezanne bastardised quite
  a bit in illustrator which is working well, but wondered if anyone had any other
  suggestions - somethign to evoke those beautiful floursishes on Elizabeth 1st&#39;s
  signature. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions welcome

    your starting point? <BR> <BR>Than you could get some real Bastarda action happening.

    not getting the point.  <BR> <BR>My assaosiation with the Drake type - it looks
    like a fashion label. <BR> <BR>I read it as &#34;Trake&#34; or &#34;Jrake&#34;

  body: I guess I can understand the need for a little femininity in the signage for
    a shopping center. However, this typeface you&#39;ve chosen does read incorrectly.
    Chances are that quite a few people will read it incorrectly until they are corrected,
    it seems this style of &#39;d&#39; will cause problems. I was going to suggest
    the <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/historicals/index.html" target="_blank">Fell
    Types</a> from the Historicals, but maybe my desire to paint Sir Francis in a
    more masculine light won&#39;t fly for a shopping center. <BR> <BR>blah blah blah
    <BR> <BR>That said, I do like the general style. But, do you think that there
    is a better choice of type? Also, do you think your ship reads a little to viking?
    And is the illustration style too clean in comparison to the fishes?

  body: '&#62; your ship reads a little to viking? <BR> <BR>Yeah, I had the same impression.
    On the other hand, a shopping center is really a lot like a village being plundered...
    <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Did somebody say &#34;Viking&#34;...? <BR> <BR>Is the shopping centre on
    water? That&#39;d be great. I like the logo, but it doesn&#39;t fit with that
    type. The ship is quite intimidating. Maybe try it out from a shallower angle. '

  body: yeah i know what you mean about the ship - its quite harsh and domineering.
    Tried this version also. It is a wee bit viking long boat-y, but less so than
    the previous one. will try the type with a cap d - tomorrow.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/24720.jpg"

    target="_blank">www.sherwoodtype.com</a> <BR> <BR>some of his faces will get you
    closer to the time period. I also agree with the idea of hiring a calligrapher,
    gee its only one word.
