  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey there! 

This is my first ever post! I used to lurk around here whenever I needed help choosing the appropriate tyepface. I'm sort of new to the world of type, so go easy on me!

Anyway, on to shameless self-promotion!

This image is my submission for Red Truck Foundation's logo design competition! The Red Truck Foundation is a non-profit organization that converts multi-terrain vehicles like motorcycles and dirt bikes into emergency vehicles. They are present in developing countries where many people live in remote areas far away from hospitals and the reach of normal emergency vehicle services.

What do you think of my logo in comparison to the others? Mine is #9. 

Anyhow, please do vote for mine [#9] (if you find it worthy) and check out the Red Truck Foundation's website!

		<div class="commentbody">Unfortunately, the vast majority of those logos clearly weren't designed with any concern for readability, or the ability to be reproduced cleanly in a variety of media.

Since the red cross is such a well-known symbol, I saw it as a red cross, rather than a "T", which made the logo read as Red Ruck Foundation. Even though you've broken apart the cross so it doesn't look exactly like the Red Cross logo, I think if the RTF used your logo (or any of the others with a red cross in it), they'd be getting some unwanted attention from the Red Cross's lawyers.

The stencil font you used also doesn't help readability. The "d" kind of reads as "cl"

You've got a good start, but there are a few things you could do to refine it that would really improve it:

• You've got three different fonts, and unrelated ones at that. See if you could limit it to one or two. If you need to use multiple fonts, you're safer using ones that contrast with each other (rather than three different sans serifs) or are from the same family (like different weights and/or widths of Franklin Gothic, or Helvetica, etc.)

• Nothing really aligns. The bottom of the horizontal bar is a little lower than the bottom of the "r" in "red", and the bottom of the vertical bar is a little lower than the "r" in "ruck"

• maybe try making the horizontal bar the same thickness as the height of the "r" and the horizontal bar a little wider than that.

• What if "foundation" had less spacing, and went from the left edge of the vertical red bar to the right edge of "k", and the tag line was the same width

The idea behind the foundation is great, and I would think they'd want something simple and iconic that didn't rely on English text to be understandable.

		<div class="commentbody">Thankyou for your response and critique!

You make some really good points.. the only sad thing is that I can't change it now since it's already been submitted. Damn. That really sucks about the red cross. I assumed that since it's the commonly accepted symbol for First Aid (which I NOW know is a white cross with a GREEN background) it would be okay. Oooooh well. 

Perhaps, if it makes it to round 2, it will magically not be a problem since I have split the bars. Probably not, but maybe. 

Thanks again! I'm still a student and am definitely still learning... every bit of constructive criticism helps!</div>
