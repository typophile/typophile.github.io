body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a headline font for the magazine I'm working
  for. They need a font that has at least 3 different cuts and that is trendy and
  not old fashioned (the topic is the futur men's fashion). But I'm not looking for
  another techno font! I've already checked my principal foundries : Typecuts, Village,
  Emigre, Font Bureau, House Industry, Lineto, Optimo, P22, Process Type Foundry,
  Hoefler & Frere-Jones and Underware, so I've got quite a lot fonts now but I want
  to make sure that I haven't forgotten a great contemporary headline font from a
  foundry that I don't know so far... So if you guys have some suggestions or already
  used an incredible font that is matching with what I want, please let me know!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    or http://www.dstype.com/main.htm?\r\n\r\nI don't have any specific suggestions,
    but these guys have some very unique, contemporary display fonts. I'm sure you'll
    find something to your liking."
