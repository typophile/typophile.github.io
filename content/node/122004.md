  body: Hard to say. Probably edited as some serifs look to have been removed (/p
    leg left, /i top and /r bottom left). [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/typewriter|Typewriter]]

    body: "hey ryuk. thanks for your reply. it is a logo of a friend of mine that
      i would like to use in one of a christmas present for him. so obviously i don't
      want to ask. i also have the impression that it is somehow edited... \r\n\r\ntypewriter
      might have been the original. i will give it try! thanks!"
