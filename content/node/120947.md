  body: "This was originally part of TeX \"Concrete\" fonts family designed by Donald
    Knuth for a book called \u201CConcrete Mathematics\u201D:\r\nhttp://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=concrete\r\n\r\nThey
    are later converted to .TTF and .OTF format and you can find it as e.g.:\r\n<strong>CMU
    Concrete (BoldItalic Extended)</strong> - Converted by Andrey V. Panov from TeX
    fonts or <strong>Computer Modern Concrete (Italic)</strong>\r\n\r\nThere is also
    a similar Google Web Font but it requires expansion and modification to match
    your sample as it is generated by tracing a MetaFont bitmap font: \r\n<strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Google-Web-Fonts%20%2F%20%28Freemium%29&ffam=jsMath-cmti10%20-%20cmti10%20Italic&fid=bdffeaca019f2dc4e584d651948d86a0&fsize=60&text=work%20Raun%20304&wrap=2|jsMath-cmti10
    (Italic)]]</strong> \r\n(c) says: \"Generated from MetaFont bitmap by mftrace
    1.0.33, http://www.cs.uu.nl/~hanwen/mftrace/\" \r\n"
