  body: Yves, it&#39;s pretty close to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gill-sans/extra-bold/testdrive.html?s=Vestax&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Gill Sans Extra Bold</a>, but the &#39;a&#39; has a thicker looking
    bowl. Either this digitization is off, or some tweaking happened.

  body: Yeah, it looks like a cross between Gill Sans and Optima. I never thought
    of them as compatible mates before. The dominant genes are from Gill, though.

  body: it&#39;s close but the eye in the E and the A is smaller than the exemple
    on myfonts.com. <BR> <BR>here is another picture, seems like the font on the .gif
    posted before was a little compressed. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25552.jpg"

  body: I&#39;m in an Illustrator kind of mood this morning. Here is a Gill Sans demo,
    using Monotype&#39;s version &#40;ought to be closest to original&#41;. I think
    the person who did the Vestax lettering noticed the ugly &#39;a&#39; and took
    action. My second simulation shows something that makes the bowl look more consistent,
    similar to the Vestax logo. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25558.gif"

  body: Boy, this looks so familiar. <BR>I thought it could be Castle/Salzburg, but
    no... <BR>At least I think it&#39;s safe to assume that this is a modified typeface.

  body: find this clue on a manual i&#39;ve got ... the logo seems to be a bold version
    of the Vestax Corporation font.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25573.jpg"

  body: The Vestax Corporation font is indeed the bastard child  <BR>of Optima and
    Gill Sans Mark. How peculiar...
