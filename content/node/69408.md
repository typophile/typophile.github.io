  the moment),\r\n\r\nhttp://carlyhitchcock.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\n I was wondering
  how do you fellow bloggers attract followers?\r\n\r\nAnything I could improve on?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  main purpose of the blog is personal (ie. research and reflection) but it would
  be great if I could get a lot of followers also- to give opinions, feedback etc...\r\n\r\nany
  advice welcome...\r\n\r\n"

  body: Well, for one, I would create some custom typography for your blog (other
    than the header) instead of using a stock template...
