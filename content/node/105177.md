body: "I need some help identifying this font \u2013\_it's a bit of an odd one. I
  thought it'd be super easy to find it because of its distinctive features but despite
  trying the obvious search words (decorative, dots, swirls, Victorian, display, retro
  etc), but so far I've failed to find it. \r\n\r\nThe closest I've got so far is
  this shoddy traced free font, but it won't really do: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontspace.com/furdzville/nocker\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much in advance!\r\n\r\n"
