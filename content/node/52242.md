  you can get quite a bit of good critique here. I recently made a logo for a company
  that does ghostwriting, helps companies with social media and tracks brand mentions
  for other companies.\r\n\r\nWondering what you guys think!\r\n\r\n(Logo and business
  card design for now)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talkingheads_6384.gif]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.wolfslittlestore.be/dump/talkingheads.png|Talking

  body: "I think their business name might have some heavy lifting to do to overcome
    what most folks think of first when they hear Talking Heads.\r\n\r\nBut, given
    that, the mark is interesting, if perhaps a bit abstract. \r\n\r\nNot sure what
    I think about the super-tight tracking. I think I like it. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes, the business name is a bit of a problem, since there is a computer/human
    experiment called Talking Heads, a music band called Talking heads, and they are
    two non-unique english words. But that's the company's choice :).

  body: "The extended, connecting serifs work pretty well. Without benefit of serifs
    to connect them, the straight-to-curve NG and curve-to-curve DS look too close.\r\nFor
    the mark, I see a head but I don't see it talking...\r\nThe bold font on the info
    in white gets kind of clogged, though you'd have to see it in print to judge. "

  body: I don't like the weight differences between Talking and Heads. They either
    need to be the same (probably my preference) or more contrasting than they are
    at the moment.

  body: "agree with aluminum. more contrast or none at all in the large type. the
    connecting serifs could be a nice idea but unfortunately you have letters that
    don't work well with this application. i'd nix it? i like the narrowness of the
    type with the narrowness of the mark. feels right looking at it at this size\r\n\r\nw|m"
