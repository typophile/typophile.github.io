  I'm embarrassed to admit that I can't think of the name of the style either. Do
  you know that too?"

  body: Thanks, Akira. After I lazily tweeted my questions I did dig around MyFonts
    and found those. And someone on Twitter reminded me of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/aquiline/">Aquiline</a>

    this style. Not everything has been pillaged! ;)

    has somewhat of the concept. But these both have a different feeling from your
    sample.  '
