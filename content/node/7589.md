body: Hello, <BR>I&#39;m working on a book project, and am using InDesign CS for the
  first time. I love the way the type looks compared with quark, but there are so
  many options under paragraph settings &#40;and elsewhere&#41;. I&#39;m wondering
  if anyone has any guidelines they use, particulary concerning min/max wordspace,
  min/max letterspace, and the glyph scaling option. <BR> <BR>This is a photography
  book that will have a total of four pages of text, so I can spend all the time in
  the world tweaking, if need be. The type will be Storm Andulka, 10/15 with 110mm
  column width. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any advice, <BR>Paul

  body: 'Hi Paul, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve used Indy for a while, and I&#39;m still learning
    about typography proper &#40;I don&#39;t think you ever stop&#41;, but these are
    the settings I&#39;m currently using: <BR>&#40;Using justified body text as an
    example&#41; <BR>1. In InDesign&#62;Preferences&#62;Composition: Turn on &#34;Show
    H&amp;J Violations&#34; &#40;this will highlight tight or loose lines for you&#41;
    <BR>2. In the Paragraph Palette, check if you want hyphenation or not, then in
    the pull-down menu turn on the Paragraph Composer. &#40;There&#39;s also a &#34;Balance
    Ragged lines&#34; option here that I haven&#39;t explored yet. That doesn&#39;t
    apply here anyway.&#41; <BR>In the Justification... section: <BR>Wordspacing:
    80%, 100%, 133% &#40;The wordspacing only works when your text is justified. Set
    &#34;Desired&#34; to less than 100% to tighten wordspacing IF it needs it. Storm
    fonts seem to set pretty tight to me at these settings.&#41; <BR>Letterspacing:
    0, 0, 0 &#40; I still have things to learn so I stay the hell away from letterspacing
    anything but SCaps!&#41; <BR>Glyph Scaling: 98, 100,102% &#40;or don&#39;t use
    at all - check if it helps or not&#41; <BR> <BR>Then when you see a highlighted
    line showing a H&amp;J violation, select the line and you can kern the Wordspacing
    only &#40;not the letterspacing!&#41; by Option-Command-Delete to remove word
    space, or Option-command-Backslash to add wordspace.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re hypenating
    text, set the hyphenation slider to 2 or 3 notches to the left of center. <BR>
    <BR>Needless to say, if anyone here knows InDesign and typography and can see
    from my settings that I&#39;m wrong or could improve it, PLEASE let me know!!'

    affect non-justified text. The &#34;Minimum&#34; and &#34;Maximum&#34; values
    come into play when text is justified.'

  body: Don&#39;t use &#34;Balance Ragged Lines&#34; its too sever, your better off
    balancing the type yourself. Some industries don&#39;t allow hypenation like the
    banking industry.

  body: Thanks for all the advice. <BR>Does anyone know if the glyph scaling option
    scales the stroke widths, or just the counters?

  body: It scales the entire glyph, affecting stroke widths as well as counters. Therefore,
    if one does it at all, it&#39;s best to keep it to just a couple of %. <BR> <BR>T
