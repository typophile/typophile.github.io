  graphics that have an almost watercolor feel to them. However, I'm having trouble
  finding a font that's really a perfect feel to accompany it. \r\n\r\nThe image is
  very soft, floral and spring, but I do want a more modern feeling font to counterbalance
  this and ensure the poster doesn't run too old. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas
  about fonts that would interact well with watercolor images that aren't script?"

    way you would have total control over how much of an effect is obtained. Or there
    are many brush-stroke fonts available. One of my favorites is a no-longer used
    proprietary font by NCL, named NCL Freestyle. \r\n - Herb"

    ago on a poster for a watercolor exhibit. Google \"photoshop watercolor type\"
    or similar phrases for tutorials.\r\n\r\nI'd only use it on large headline type,
    though, and only if the head was on a plain background.\r\n"
