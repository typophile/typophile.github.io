  body: "What the client wants :  A \"progressive\" fast forward look.  Communicate
    that they are going places. The logo should represent \"ambition\"; \"striving
    for greatness and perfection\". Moving forward, progress. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout
    the client's organization: AURDOS is a start-up progressive contract manufacturing
    firm. Our initial product line will be battery packs for laptop computers and
    universal laptop batteries. We will soon add batteries, chargers and other accessories
    for a variety of electronic portable equipment such as MP3 players, camcorders,
    cameras to our product line. Many of the products that we plan to introduce over
    the next few years will be marketed to the broad consumer market. Most of our
    products will be for a variety of consumer electronic devices, such as digital
    photo frames etc. So we want a logo with a universal appeal. Something like SONY
    which is such a neutral logo that it can pretty much be applied to any electronic
    device. Similarly we want a universal look for AURDOS. \r\n "

  body: Those examples are of course not the classic Sony direction which is a serif
    type. But based on part of what you said you want they might be good choices.
    To make a proper logo you may want to have somebody meld the letters to each other
    among other things. But if you can start with a clear set of references that will
    help a great deal. How do you like the typeface being used in the headers just
    now here on Typophile (FF Clan Pro)?

    is what I've come up with. Is it showing what the client suggest? Am I able to
    imagine this logo everywhere. Yes there is some rerinement work to be done but
    before that I just want to get some feedback. Please suggets."

  body: The forms themselves are little lumpy but it might be a fine idea - needing
    refinement. It might be better if you are not used to designing letters or you
    don't have much time to simply use a font. Or maybe modify a font's outlines.
