  body: It's fairly similar to Cosmos Bold, but the C could look better.

  body: "<blockquote>It is Myanmar MN...</blockquote>\r\n... Or Oriya (and many others)...
    It actually describes [[http://www.monotypeimaging.com/productsservices/wt_info.aspx?type=burmese|a
    Non-Latin script used to write Burmese language in the Myanmar region]], so definitely
    nothing to do with your sample... Except for its Latin-Part but I couldn't find
    anything on the Latin-part based-on font... I've found 2 similars for your sample
    though: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/euro-sans-pro/|Euro Sans]] and
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/carisma/|Carisma]]"

  body: That C reminds me of [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=oilcan|Oil Can]],
    but otherwise it's not a match.
