  body: I was in a newsgroup where someone was advertising 5 logo concepts and unlimited
    revisions for $29.95. And the guy swore his stuff was the real deal. I'm pretty
    sure if you could find this guy, he'd agree to learn to make fonts and meet the
    deadline by Friday.

    a bad idea, James. Although in this case, I think the response they got merits
    leaving them both up.  :-D\r\n\r\nAs for Logo Creator... I didn't even know such
    a thing existed!"

    when they get one of those hard-to-please people. Or more likely, do they simply
    plan on being hard-to-contact?"

    Maybe these people aren''t aware of how many fonts are already available. '

    the client, cut the losses, and re-use the logos for the next client. I would
    imagine that re-using unsold designs could make this sort of venture pretty profitable
    over time (assuming that one lives somewhere cheap)."
