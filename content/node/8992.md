body: Hi, <BR>I need to place a logo on the head of a guitar. Has anyone done this
  before? The person I&#39;m doing the logo for makes his guitars by hand, so I would
  love to know of a way to do this by hand. But any way of doing this would be nice
  to know, if just for reference. The woods he uses are typically dark, so I&#39;m
  thinking a white ink, but I also want to consider using a metallic ink, if possible,
  such as on a martin. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.musiciansbuy.com/mmMBCOM/images/martin/martin_lx1e_headstock.jpg"

  <BR> <BR>If I can&#39;t find a way to do it by hand, using a printer &#40;thermography?&#41;
  would be fine too. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>- Brian -

  body: 'I&#39;ll echo Dan here: a decal will probably be the most serviceable solution.
    But if you <i>have</i> to print, screen-printing is no doubt your best &#40;and
    perhaps only&#41; option.'

  body: A custom dry-transfer which is then varnished should also work.

  body: Guitar logos are either decals or inlaid. They are never stencilled to my
    knowledge. except on very cheap guitars.

  body: I&#39;ve custom painted guitars and I&#39;ve used a clear decal on the head
    and then a few coats of varnish over it. Unless you&#39;re really looking at it
    closely, you won&#39;t see the edge of the decal.

  body: We use a water release inkjet printable decal to transfer designs onto shell
    as a template for cutting inlays. I&#39;ve never used it as a decorative component,
    but it might be worth experimenting. You can buy small quanties from <a href="http://www.ceramicdecals.cc/"
    target="_blank"> Bel</a>. <BR> <BR>I did once experiment with an ALPS printer
    and a gold transfer foil on water release, that looked nice, but the printer finally
    died and it was discontinued many moons ago.  <BR> <BR>As far as thermography,
    if the design is done right, I&#39;ve seen amzing things done with rubber stamps
    and embossing powders.  <BR> <BR>Make sure you check any method for interactions
    with the particular finish on a test.
