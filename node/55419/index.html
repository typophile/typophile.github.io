  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been going through all my pictures from the last week. It&rsquo;s been a pretty hectic one. Lundi and Mardi Gras at the beginning of the week, then a quick voyage to Santa Clara for a conference entirely unrelated to design, but still entirely beneficial for the purpose.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture to sum up Lundi Gras:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Carol_MaryAnn_3436.jpg" alt="">
Meet Carol and Mary Ann, in the letterforms &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and &ldquo;L.&rdquo;
We met them before Proteus and Orpheus, after sitting around at the same spot on St. Charles between Napoleon and General Pershing (streets). They asked to share our spot, and since it was two of us and four of them (plus husbands) we didn&rsquo;t mind at all (there was lots of room, and while they don&rsquo;t look it, they&rsquo;re really unobtrusive) and they shared brie and gouda with crackers, spinach dip, and errands for poor Corey to run (sending him to fetch cigarettes from their husbands who were seated away from the mayhem, for example, or getting free Red Bull from the Red Bull girls). We didn&rsquo;t ask about the marijuana beads; they didn&rsquo;t question my assignment to take pictures of outfits with letterforms. They were, in fact, very enthusiastic about my mission to document typographic costumes. Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Letter_J_Cape_4042.jpg" alt="">
Letter &ldquo;J&rdquo; as demonstrated by a knight&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Flambeaux_Ts_3967.jpg" alt="">
Letter &ldquo;T&rdquo; in the lower case&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/P_Drums_4176.jpg" alt="">
A P or two&hellip; I cheated and took this one on Mardi Gras&hellip; But it still counts as a parade picture, and there were lots of these marching in all the parades&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Bead_Jacket_4411.jpg" alt="">
This struck me as being letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; esque. Most of the letterforms I snapped involved negative/positive space relations more than anything else, but lucky for me Carol and Mary Ann had keen eyes. They yelled at me to take pictures of a helicopter, pointed out the backs of trucks, and recruited innocent bystanders to bend themselves into alphabet shapes.

<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a little bit of graphic design in all of us. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve inspired for them a new calling&hellip;</p>
