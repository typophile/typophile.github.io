  I apologize for but it's the only one I could find. \r\n\r\nhref='http://img809.imageshack.us/i/fontn.jpg/'><img
  src='http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/650/fontn.jpg' border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
  looks to be 2 different fonts. . . one font used to set the all caps and one for
  the lower cases in the second half. \r\n\r\nI looked through all the serifs and
  display fonts on fontshop and couldn't come up with anything. The most distinguishable
  characters are the R, F, E in the word FEATURING. It looks as if the arms have a
  slight downward curve and the R's leg has an extreme outward curve.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase
  type is interesting, no dots on the i's (which the designer could have removed),
  slight serifs and the descender of the g's have a slight sharp angle. \r\n\r\nAnybody
  have any ideas?"

    not sure you can find a digital equivalent. \r\nThe lowercase's proportions reminds
    me of Bodega:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bodega-serif/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bodega-sans/"
