body: "Hi, I'm looking for a serif or slab font with a large x value to use on a magazine
  cover. The text is just 2 letter: RH, and I would like it to form a rectangle standing
  on its smallest side. The magazine is a business publication, so there is a concern
  on it looking serious. Anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nMy typeface knowledge
  is pretty thin, so please feel free to quote obvious choices. So far I've come up
  with things like Palatino, Weiss and Minion. But I' not sure I'm on the right track.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Compressed]]?

  body: "As the links provided by Freiberger show, x-height is a value used for the
    lowercase.\r\nAs Craig (eliason) said, if you are going to use uppercase letters,
    you should ask compressed, condensed, narrow, or tall, capitals.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/narrow+slab/"

  body: "If the logo requirement is two uppercase letters, RH, why do you need a font
    design with a large x-height?\r\n\r\nAnd even if the logo is made up of two lowercase
    letters, why care about the x-height to Uppercase proportion?"
