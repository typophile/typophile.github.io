  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For one of my studios this summer we have been given the freedom to propose our own projects, either as individuals or as small groups. For my project I considered a wide variety of options, including designing and sewing my own t-shirt (It would have been similar to the <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/index.php?page=489">cycling inspired casual t-shirts</a> that Rapha makes.). In the end, I chose the mildly daunting task of designing my own, fully functional typeface. In the words of my classmates I&rsquo;m &ldquo;crazy ambitious.&rdquo; Of course, a typeface can&rsquo;t be designed in one summer, especially considering the workload of other studios burdening my time, so I&rsquo;m hoping to carry this into an independent study project next quarter and/or my thesis project. Turning it into my thesis project will depend to a certain extent on the theme given to us, but one of my professors has expressed a willingness to bend and stretch any possible theme—she is pretty stoked that I am so excited and motivated.</p>
<p>While most of my classmates came up with half-assed identity projects that intentionally require a minimal amount of time and effort, I&rsquo;m not the only one to take on a fairly ambitious project. One student, inspired by a website dedicated to walkers world-wide is attempting to do her own version of the site, creating a community aspect that would be in some way tied into a user&rsquo;s Facebook profile in addition to the website she is developing. Another group of students are attempting to brew their own beer and are creating a brand identity and strategy to accompany it—they&rsquo;re researching all sorts of really cool low-tech bottling, recycling, and packaging methods.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, we had a studio in which we learned to draw letters, but in the end only had to produce 9 letters of a serif, sans, and display (for a total 27). My intentions are to do a complete glyph set for bold, book, and italic weights <i>and</i> to exploit the abilities of OpenType as much as possible. To satisfy the proposal I submitted at the beginning of the summer I only have to produce the forms for 13 letters by next Friday. I&rsquo;ve done so with a fair amount of ease. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed spending my nights drawing and digitizing letters. Perhaps too much—I&rsquo;ve gone out and partied with my friends very little in exchange. But I enjoy it just as much and don&rsquo;t have to suffer through the occasional Sunday hang-over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to summon the courage in the next few days to show my letters here. I am in desperate need of constructive criticism—my classmates only seem to be able to give me comments like, &ldquo;your J is cute,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your C kind of reminds me of Rotis.&quot;—but am naturally a bit scared of being seen as the complete novice that I am.</p>
