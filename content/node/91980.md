body: "Hello all.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a display face. Something probably similar
  to a normal roman text face, but with a bit of quirky personality. Or, something
  entirely different from a normal text face.\r\n\r\nIt is for the title page and
  cover of a novel. I was using Andreas St\xF6tzner's Reinstaedt for a while, but
  the author wasn't going for it (this is for a self-publishing client). The title
  is three short words connected by hyphens, with a questions mark. For the sake of
  keeping the title off the web for the time being, I'll pretend it is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_title_6539.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  \"novel\" is really a collection of short stories about all sorts of different characters
  in different places discovering what they want their life's mission to be. In every
  case, though, this mission is something quirky, strange, trivial, or funny.\r\n\r\nThe
  text is set in Garamond Premier Pro. Throughout the book there are pages of simulated
  magazine cutouts in a smorgasbord of fonts. There is also a recurring \"cut edge\"
  motif, as if some pages were roughly cut with scissors, mirroring the \"cutouts\"
  from magazines.\r\n\r\nSo \u2014 any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I think I may be looking for something similarly exuberant but based on contemporary
    forms instead of blackletter. Something perhaps a little more ordinary / contemporary
    but with the quirkiness I'm looking for.
