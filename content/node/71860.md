  OK. I digitized a script font for one of our lettering artists here at American
  Greetings. There are lots of contextual substitutes that come into play. Anyway\u2026
  she mentioned to me that on some letters if she did a baseline shift the character
  would switch out to a different version. After watching her do this for a while
  I realized what was happening, but not why. \r\n\r\nWhen the character being shifted
  (or the one just to its right also) has a beginning of line version  \u2026that
  would come in every time you shift. It seemed as if baseline shift treated the type
  as if it were the start of a new line. So if you shift a capital up from the middle
  of the line Illustrator is treating it like its a new line so the feature code has
  a swash cap come in. \r\n\r\nAnyone ever see this happen or no if anything can be
  done about it?"

    why it is off by default.

  body: "Thanks, Chris.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I just tested it in InDesign and the
    same thing happens there as well. I think baseline shift is essentially the equivalent
    of a new line  start. It only does it with characters that have a start glyph
    that is programmed to come in at the beginning of a line. So if a sentence in
    the middle of a line starts with the word \"Special\" the S is seen as if its
    a new line and a swash S comes in to substitute. Then the p is also seen as a
    new line and since I have a swash p that comes in after the S. Its not that anyone
    would necessarily need to shift the baseline on script letters, but it does kind
    of trip things up if somebody does decide to move a capital up or down."

    likely, shifting the baseline inserts a bit of code between the characters, which
    throws the calt feature off..."

  body: "OT features are applied to runs of text of the same font/style. If you change
    one of these, a new run of text is created. Perhaps doing a baseline shift causes
    this, too.\r\n\r\n(There was just some discussion about this sort of thing earlier
    today: http://typophile.com/node/71775 . Scroll down to the part where Adam explains
    how OT features are applied to text.)"

  body: Thanks, Mark. That at least puts it in perspective. Doesn't seem like there
    is a fix for it that I can make in feature code, but at least I have a better
    sense of why it does this.:)
