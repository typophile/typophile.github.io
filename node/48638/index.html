<p>Thanks for the replyes&hellip;</p>

I posted on other Post but no one anwser me :-( here what I’ looking specifically:</p>
<p>In the presentation that Mark Simonson made about Adrian Frutiger, (more info [[http://www.marksimonson.com/article/179/frutiger-talk|here]]) at some point he shows a picture of a old magazine/newspaper about typography (Upper and Lower Case I think) that shows an article from Frutiger called “Design and development of one basic typeface into a family of 21 different weights and proportions”.
I would love to read this article.
Since I couldn’t find it on the web I was wonder in anyone here has this article that can share.</p>
<p>terminaldesign 
Well&hellip;If the price is affordable for a Portuguese salary&hellip;I can consider in keeping them&hellip;</p>

<p>Being a great fan of typographic auctions, and being someone who has bid aggressively on items in the past, I have always been disappointed by the Typophile auctions and the true lack of zeal of those doing the bidding. Maybe it the lack of understanding as to the value of what is being offered, or perhaps it is an economic thing.</p>
<p>I remember in San Francisco, Dave Farey found a beautiful copy of &ldquo;Big Red&rdquo; in one of the bookstores, and put it up for auction for what he paid for it, and it never even got an opening bid. I wound up paying him what he paid so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to lug it back home to the UK. Now I have two copies of &ldquo;Big Red&rdquo;!</p>
<p>So I guess the short answer to your suggestion would be, probably not.</p>
