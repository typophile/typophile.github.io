body: "Dusan Script is a new set of handwriting style fonts from the Tour De Force
  font foundry. They were created by Serbian graphic designer Du\u0161an Jelesijevi\u0107.
  \r\n\r\nDusan Script is a wonderful set of handwriting script fonts that captures
  the graceful flow and idiosyncrasies of Du\u0161an's penmanship. They have an airy,
  natural personality, with open counters and features that make it legible at small
  and large sizes. Dusan Script is available in TrueType and OpenType formats at AscenderFonts.com
