  of [[Futura]] sketched out or layed out the way he had constructed it. Any help
  would be much appreciated :)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I'm pretty sure Christopher Burke's Renner biography -- The Art of Typography
    -- contains documentation of Futura's development, including discarded designs
    and early versions.  I don't have my copy handy to double-check but it's a safe
    place for you to start.

  body: This <a href=http://typophile.com/node/18165>thread</a> a while back linked
    to a thesis on Futura, which, if I remember correctly, goes into the form and
    Renner's process quite a bit. I've been meaning to finish reading it; maybe now
    I'll get around to it.

  body: The Burke book doesn't feature anything that is not also in the Charles thesis.
    You might try contacting Burke to see if more drawings exist than those he reprinted;
    his research included a lot of digging through the old Bauer files that turned
    up an assortment of long-forgotten goodies.
