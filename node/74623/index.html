Reading the blog post he linked to, it seems evident that they&rsquo;re still in a very early stage. (i.e. they first will propose ideas for a typeface and then they will try to finance the production of the one chosen by the readers).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you all for your comments, I think that Aaron &amp; I fell victim to that scenario where you talk about something for so long that when you go to share it you forget that not everyone has been around the whole time. Thank you especially riccardo0, you&rsquo;ve pretty much hit the nail on the head. To clarify what might have been missed in my initial post, or the blog entry we made I&rsquo;ll lay it out as quickly &amp; clearly as I can.</p>
<p>•We are looking at creating a display typeface. 
•We are looking at funding the creation of this typeface through KickStarter donations.
•We (People Collective) will be handling the creation of the typeface.
•We will, over the next few weeks, post 3 type sketches/directions to our blog.
•We will create the typeface which garners the most interest/discussion.
•We chose to fund the creation through KickStarter so that we can distribute the typeface for free.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t put a KickStarter page up yet, that will appear once a typeface has been chosen to create.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this clarifies things a bit, again, thank you for contributing and stay tuned!</p>

<p>Will people only contribute to your project if they will get the font for free?
That seems to run against the intent of KickStarter.
It will give the investors a R.O.I. and free fonts for non-investors, while reducing creators' remuneration &ndash; all of which run counter to the intent of KickStarter, which states that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Creators keep 100% ownership. Kickstarter is a new form of commerce and patronage, not a place for investment or lending.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I could see Kickstarter working for an established type designer, if say Nick, Zapf, Chank or Carter were to set something up. The resulting font could even be given away, with donators perhaps getting a special edition version or signed specimen or something. But for newbies the traditional routes of myfonts or dafont seem more appropriate.</p>
<p>It could work for a type design newbie if they have followers in other areas - perhaps a musician or minor celebrity (Balloon Boy or Jerrod from Subway) might attract enough curiosity to attract a couple of $K.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your commets guys. Nick, the route we are looking at is more along the lines of Diaspora and This American Life, those who can contribute do so that the rest of the population can enjoy the product. When Kickstarter say &ldquo;Creators keep 100% ownership&rdquo; they are referring to Kickstarter themselves not owning any part of the funded project. If we fund the development of a typeface through Kickstarter, then that typeface is ours to do as we wish, which would be to make it freely available.</p>
<p>As we mentioned on our blog post, there will be other benefits and rewards for contributors, as there is with other Kickstarter projects.</p>
