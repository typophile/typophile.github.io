    basic question multiple times in multiple forums. You\u2019ll find that most members
    peruse many of the different forums on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nI suggest further
    discussion should be directed to your original thread in the Design forum, <strong>Typography
    in Children\u2019s Books</strong>: \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/66159 "
