    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s quite lovely. Whimsical in a restrained,  <BR>refined way. '

    if it&#39;s true that MSL uses something called &#34;gravure&#34; for printing
    &#40;where the text is rendered like pictures, not text&#41;, then if I ever had
    the good fortune of making a font for them, I wouldn&#39;t spend too much time
    on that last bit of quality... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: 'The slab serif is interesting, but I can&#39;t say that I like it any better
    than the Joanna. But the all-caps made me think of PMN Caecilia, at first, which
    I do like a lot. I agree, the italic is nicely realized for the style -- resembles
    FB&#39;s Berlizio Italic. <BR> <BR>Hrant, it&#39;s not quite true that gravure
    renders text like pictures -- at least, it&#39;s not like what you might think
    in reference to offset litho halftones.  I don&#39;t know for sure, but I&#39;d
    bet that the rasterization is just as high-res as rendering for offset. But the
    gravure process is intaglio: the ink is held in small depressions on the metal
    plate. Intaglio printing does not handle flat solids well. Solids are created
    through closely clustered depressions, sort of like very dense stippling. This
    is what causes the &#34;fuzzy&#34; edges.  <BR> <BR>But, the magazine is printed
    in a combination of offset for some sigs and gravure for others. So, if you ever
    design a face for them &#40;<I>yeah, right</I> -- maybe the Armenian edition?
    ;-&#41; then you&#39;d better go ahead and polish it off. <BR> <BR>-- K.'

  body: ' So yesterday I was at B&amp;N and checked out an actual issue &#40;after
    making sure nobody I knew was looking ;-&#41; and I think the Roman actually works
    well in context, and the italic is still delish, but the repro did seem a bit
    &#34;hazy&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp '
