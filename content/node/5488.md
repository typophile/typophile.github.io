  place is a fantastic resource. <BR>I&#39;d hate to see it disappear. <BR>I bring
  every typography class here. <BR>As far back as the 80s when I taught for TANY.

  TDC allow Barbara to make a plea to the membership? Would AIGA? <BR>Is this something
  that Adobe or Apple should look into.Or a paper manufacturer? <BR>Or Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian?
  Any ideas&#34;? <BR>Is this the answer? I don&#39;t know. I promised Barbara I would
  try to help her. <BR>I am contacting everyone I know for ideas. <BR> <BR>I do know
  that the obituaries I read in the trades after the auction at ATF <BR>sickened me
  as too little too late. <BR>How can we make this work? <BR>Please advise. <BR>sk
  <BR>Steve Kennedy <BR> <BR>BTW: Bowne &amp; Company is home to the Frederic Nelson
  Phillips/Tri-Arts Press <BR>collection one of the largest collections of nineteenth-century
  American wood <BR>and foundry types, rivaled only by the collection in the Smithsonian.
