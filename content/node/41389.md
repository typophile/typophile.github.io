  was the capital R. I'm trying to demonstrate the idea of pieces of positive and
  negative space fitting together implying lines.\r\nNow how do I ask this? Am I unwittingly
  copying someone else's work here? What I mean is\u2014I'm relatively new to type
  design and I haven't read more than a handful of books on the subject\u2014does
  this look like a ripoff of someone else's design or concept?"

  body: "Hi, David, \r\n\r\nNice work. I know of at least two typefaces that work
    with a similar idea, but then again they use different types of shapes as their
    starting points. One of them is <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Avia\">Avia</a>,
    by Raphael Boguslav and Jill Pichotta. The inspiration was \"faulty platemaking
    or light inking\" that causes the hairlines to be lost, according to Font Bureau's
    catalog. It goes on to say that Boguslav \"understood it as a sophisticated form
    of stencil design.\"\r\n\r\nI think this shows that two different people can arrive
    at similar solutions while working on different problems. And it wouldn't be the
    first time this has happened. Since you're relatively new to type design, it might
    be a good idea to continue with this project... You will probably learn a lot
    from it.\r\n\r\nI've forgotten what the other typeface is called... It might be
    a custom job, actually, or unreleased. I am pretty sure that it was featured in
    Print or Step Inside Design a year or two ago, in those annual Young Visual Artists/Ones
    to Watch specials that they do.\r\n\r\nOh, and this older thread might have something,
    too: \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15767\r\n\r\nOne more thing... If you would
    also like a critique of your typeface, try posting some examples in the Critique
    section of Typophile."
