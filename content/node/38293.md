  body: "It's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/amsterdamer-garamont/\">Amsterdamer
    Garamont</a>. It strongly resembles large sizes of metal ATF Garamond, from which
    I'm sure Amsterdamer (and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-garamont/\">LTC</a>)
    are digitized.\r\n\r\n(I earlier posted Garamond No. 3 and Simoncini, both of
    which are halfway decent matches, also being based on the ATF, but I think the
    Amsterdamer is the actual digital font file this was set from)\r\n"
