		<div class="commentbody"><p>I had the same problem - wrote to fontlab and they said it is going to take a month to fix it!
They expect me to sit and wait by for a month?</p>
<p>Got a bit shocked from their poor customer service which in the end left me no choice but to cancel my copy of fontlab studio.</p>
<p>It really annoys me to find such poor service when you pay a premium, specially when alternatives are starting to show (Robofont which I will probably go for). Not once an apology or acknowledgement of responsibility for their product.</p>
<p>All in all the correspondent is pretty funny when you think about it. Attaching it here for your entertainment:</p>
<hr>
<p>Yuval,</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback. We are working on the problem.</p>
<p>Regards,
Alex Petrov
Fontlab Ltd. Support</p>

<p>Hi Alex</p>
<p>Do you have an estimate of when you will solve this problem?</p>
<p>days? weeks? months?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>yuval</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi Yuval,</p>
<p>I hope much we will release the final stable version within a month.</p>
<p>Regards,
Alex Petrov
Fontlab Ltd. Support</p>

<p>Thanks Alex for your answer.</p>
<p>A month is a bit longer than expected - Who do I talk to about compensation?</p>
<p>I have bought fontlab studio with the believe that a Lion version is working (although unstable). 
I don&rsquo;t mind unstable version but this is unusable as I can&rsquo;t save or generate fonts.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Yuval</p>
<hr>
<p>Yuval,</p>
<p>Studio Public Preview 2 was released on Sept., 29 and was stable enough until Apple released 10.7.2 on October, 12. I think we will fix this quickly in Public Preview 3. May be in a week but the final version will take not less than a month.</p>
<p>Regards,
Alex Petrov</p>
<hr>
<p>Alex</p>
<p>I have bought my version after Lion came out thinking I would have a working version on my OS.
But I don&rsquo;t intend to loose a month&rsquo;s worth of work on a quite expensive program that doesn&rsquo;t work, regardless of the reason!</p>
<p>I understand your position but Intel macs have been around for a while now and all my other programs work fine on Lion 10.7.2.
Most graphic designers usually work on Macs so an investment in the mac platform seems kind of obvious. Doing it so late in the game is a bit crazy from a customer point of view.</p>
<p>If you can fix it into a working version in a week than fine, I&rsquo;ll sit by.</p>
<p>If not I would expect either a refund or some kind of compensation.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Yuval Toch</p>

<p>Yuval Toch</p>
<p>I can issue a credit at any time, just  forward me your receipt along with a short note stating that you would like to return the product (please mention the product by name) and that it has been removed from your computer and you will not ever be using it.</p>
<hr>
<p>(This time I lost it a bit and here is my rant back:)</p>
<p>Alex Petrov</p>
<p>I stated that I would be willing to wait for a week but you know what, from your reply I understand that fontlab is clearly not interested in my business and therefore I am not interested in yours as well.</p>
<p>I would like to return Fontlab Studio and receive a refund for the £493.85 I have paid. As soon as I receive the funds back I will remove the application from my computer and I will not be using it again ever.
I would also advise anyone I know not to use it due to terrible customer service and poor technical support.</p>
<p>Please find my receipt attached.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Yuval Toch</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Nice job - You have managed to convert a slightly annoyed customer into an upset and angry one.</p>
<p>One advice: Hire a customer service expert as you are clearly not someone that should reply to your customers, specially since the font market is growing and wouldn&rsquo;t stay a niche one for long.</p>

Why are graphic designers such nerds?
It&rsquo;s your responsability to make sure the tools you want to use will work on new software.
Maybe wait a bit and ask around to see how things work?</div>
