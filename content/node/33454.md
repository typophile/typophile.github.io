  forum. \r\n\r\nI am working on a logo for non-profit/charitable organization. Eventually
  I want to use <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18\"
  title=\"houseind.com Neutraface\">Neutraface</a>. The family is $249 \u2013 pretty
  much for my uncompensated project.\r\n\r\nDo you know a way out? Is there a similar
  free font? Would House Industries probably give me a great discount (I do not need
  the whole family, it is for charity, it is only used in one single logo)?\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help!\r\nlu\r\n"

    similar experiences, so I was be informed before trying it out. Anyone? Do foundries
    sometimes give discounts or sell a single cut, which is not available on their
    website?\r\nThanks so far!\r\nlu"

  body: "If you just need certain letters/characters of a single cut, why not just
    ask someone to typeset those letters for you, convert them to paths, and send
    you an .EPS file? I'm sure that someone could work out a reasonable price, or
    it's a charity/pro-bono job, maybe they could just donate their time as you are.\r\n\r\nIn
    the olden days, when you ordered type, you just got a page with the type you asked
    for, and then cut it up, enlarged it, etc as needed.\r\n\r\nYou might also try
    scanning from one of their catalogs, but you probably won't get a clean enough
    image to work with.\r\n\r\nSean Glenn\r\nArt Director\r\nwww.superunicorn.com"

  body: "How are using the face? All caps, upper- and lower-case?\r\n\r\nFor all caps,
    there are a number of fonts that have a similar geometric/Art Deco construction--for
    some reason, Mostra and Penumbra Sans spring to mind.\r\n\r\nFor upper and lower-case,
    Avenir and Futura are affordable options that are sold in single weights for around
    $30."

  body: "Thanks for all your answers.\r\n\r\nadnix: I'll use eight letters, all lower
    case: a f h m n o r u\r\nI had a deeper look on <em>Futura Book Oblique</em>,
    although it is not similar to Neutraface, I think it is fitting, too. It is 26$,
    so I am fine with that.\r\n\r\nseanglenn: As written above I found a solution
    thanks to the help of all of you. But in general I am curios about your suggestion:
    Am I allowed to use them, only because they are converted into a path? Or is it,
    that then the license is paid by the person sending me the path and therefor it
    is legal."
