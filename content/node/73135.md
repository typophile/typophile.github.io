body: "We've released several new fonts since I last visited Typophile, so here's
  a quick update.\r\n\r\nAylward Font\r\n\r\nI seem to still be operating in the mode
  of fonts based on Victorian era advertising cuts, and Aylward fits in that tradition,
  based on several variants of the same style of wood type. Aylward is a bold display
  face with exaggerated serifs and some unusual features like the really unique design
  of the \u201CA\u201D and the spiral forms on the \u201CS\u201D and \u201CG\u201D
  characters. Aylward offers a trule unique and antique look but is very readable
  and striking without being too heavy or overly ornate. It also includes not just
  a single style, but also a variant with spurs on the ascenders and curves of the
  characters. Because this is a display face it has no proper lowercase, so the standard
  font includes the spurred characters on the uppercase and the plain characters as
  the lowercase. As a bonus there is also a custom outline version of the font which
  can be bought separately or is included packaged with the main font, so it\u2019s
  like getting three fonts in one.  More info and free demo at: http://www.fontcraft.com/fontcraft/2010/03/new-font-aylward/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aylwardmf_4913.jpg]\r\n\r\nLetterpress
  Gothic\r\n\r\nWith all the coverage we did of the Hatch Show Print exhibit it seemed
  only appropriate to develop a font which embodied that design look. The result is
  our new Letterpress Gothic font which embodies one of the quirks of letterpress
  printing, the occasional combination of characters which are very similar, but don\u2019t
  quite match. To do this we took characters from a number of different letterpress
  gothic style fonts, distressed them to give them the look of being printed from
  old blocks, and combined them together to form two complete alphabets, along with
  some special characters, particularly filled-in Em and En spaces for crude line
  balancing. The end result is surprisingly effectrive, with a lot of character and
  a good representation of the feel of primitive printed posters. It\u2019s actually
  aimed somewhat below the sophistication of a lot of the fancy letterpress work Hatch
  produces, but it\u2019s an excellent example of what you might have found on an
  early 20th century playbill or show poster from a smaller press. More info and free

  great many years ago when working in game publishing I had a real fascination with
  doing titles in a strong, super-bold font called Bolt Bold. The truth is I rather
  overused it. In doing some research I find it on more than a dozen different game
  books I wrote in the early 80s, all quite collectable and out of print today. Back
  in those days we did the titles using rub-on lettering from Letraset. Although I
  used it a lot, there were always some things about Bolt Bold which I was dissatisfied
  with. I actually wished it were a little bolder and I never much liked the lowercase
  character set or the peculiar dissonance between the rounded exterior corners and
  square interior corners. More info and free demo at: http://www.fontcraft.com/fontcraft/2010/06/new-font-bigblok/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bigblokmf_4753.jpg]"
