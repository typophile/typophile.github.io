  body: Hmm. This looks very similar to something I've seen (in a single weight close
    to SB) in the last week or so, and it was not Cronos. Don't remember what it was,

  body: "Maybe you are right Steve. I see now there is a small difference between
    the image sample and Cronos in top left of |n| and bottom right of |a| but I don't
    know if this really make it a different font. \r\nIf you remember what you have
    seen, we could make a comparison..."
