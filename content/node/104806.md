body: "Early '80 video titling Type ID\r\n\r\nIn early '80 in Italy, this font was
  used for a video titling of a japanese cartoon.\r\nWhat type is it?\r\nWhat type
  machine or technics could be used to do such a kind of title?\r\nThis type was used
  after in '80 and '90 for titling video. Maybe can it be stored in such a digital
  video titler?\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/6092/4b3s.png"
