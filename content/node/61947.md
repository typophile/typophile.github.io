  body: Christopher, if a thread goes in a direction that you think gets away from
    the original topic, while leaving some things on that topic unsaid, I think you
    need to re-strike the original topic, not just provide a new thread. In other
    words, it would help if you were to identify those aspects of the previous discussion
    to which you would like to return.

  body: "Actually, it was kind of a blunder on my part. As my last post said, \"I've
    been away for a while.\" After I posted this, I noticed a \"next page\" button
    on the original thread (as is the technical convention here so you know the start
    regardless of what page you're on). I saw the original post at the top of the
    thread, and mine immediately below. I guess what happened was upon my original
    post, there was only one page. After I posted, it created a 2nd page.I thought
    the post at the top of the page was Duggan re-posting his original statement in
    an effort to \"bring things back on topic.\" Sorry for the confusion, But It <em>has</em>
    been a question on my mind regardless. I like Hudson's idea: If you think a thread
    is going off topic and want to create a \"redirect,\" state in the new thread
    the main points from the previous thread/issues to be addressed in the redirected
    thread so that participants need not go through the entirety of the old thread.\r\n\r\n(did
    I get that right?)\r\n\r\nI think moderators should make this call though. Potentially
    a complex issue. Had I not had technical confusion, I probably wouldn't have started
    this discussion I don't have a problem with wandering conversation. Please don't
    misinterpret my tone as angry &c. I am going to re-title this thread accordingly.
    Sorry for the confusion."
