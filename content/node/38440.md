  and in particular at the different contextual (not sure if that's the right term,
  but it makes sense in my mind) weights - i.e. Display, Caption Subhead...\r\n\r\nNow,
  I appreciate Display and Caption variances from the regular design, but the Subh
  version looks identical to the Display variation, apart from maybe very slightly
  looser tracking.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to see any subtle differences as I am just looking
  at the rasterised samples on myfonts... can anyone explain why the Subh context
  of this typeface is worth the extra investment?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSteve"

    They are each intended to work optimally at different point sizes. Check this
