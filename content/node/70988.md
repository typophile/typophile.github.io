body: "Hello --\r\n\r\nThe image is from some personalized stationery that I need
  to match. The original order was from a boutique in Arizona that was most likely
  a reseller of products from some place like Carlson Craft. I'd considered Birch
  or Latino Elongated but am needing something that has a lower case e closer to the
  sample.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any suggestions."
