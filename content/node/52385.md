  body: "If I recall correctly, Mimeograph was that high-inducing process of reproducing
    handouts back in elementary and high school. You know, the handouts with the purple
    ink and intoxicating aroma. \r\n\r\nThe masters for these were \"stencils\" of
    sorts. Usually you fed the master right into the typewriter and typed the text
    right on it. You could also mark the master directly, drawing right on the cover
    sheet. These masters were then combined with the smelly solvent to cause a transfer
    of the image. The number of copies was limited, and toward the end of a long run,
    they could get quite faded.\r\n\r\nI think there were other similar, but different,
    technologies that went by the same general name. So, maybe these tools are for
    something different than my purple memories.\r\n\r\nBut, in any event, the tools
    look like they're made for marking these stencils. Some, like the yellow ones
    on the left, look like they're for marking directly -- basically like empty ball-points.
    The translucent yellow pattern piece looks like you place it behind the master,
    and then rubbing the front with one of the burnishers, like the black and green
    ones on the right, you transfer a dot pattern to the master, essentially creating
    a halftone or Ben Day pattern. That's pretty sophisticated: I don't remember any
    mimeograph handouts that ever went to that extent.\r\n\r\nThat's my guess.\r\n\r\n--
    K."
