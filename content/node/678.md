  body: I got 15. The top 5 takers scored 17-19. <BR> <BR>I feel this year&#39;s quiz
    was designed for the elderly grayhairs  <BR>like Bill Powers and Dave Farey who
    won. Don&#39;t let Kent fool  <BR>you, he&#39;s younger than his typographic knowledge
    indicates. <BR> <BR>BTW, question 35 was much more difficult as they presented
    <BR>some of the designer&#39;s older, more obscure faces. <BR> <BR>Can we get
    Kent to upload the original pics?

  body: 'That&#39;s Will Powers, Stewf! He&#39;s our local typographic encyclopedia
    -- and much appreciated for it. <BR> <BR>I suck at these games, but they are quite
    fun to watch. Lots of groans and fun hints. My cropdusting of gray hairs was no
    help whatsoever. It&#39;s not an age thing: it&#39;s a matter of keeping lots
    of unrelated information available for output at the proper moment. It should
    also be obvious that a bit of knowledge of the local typo scene is needed. It&#39;s
    time to start studying up on the Bay Area! <BR> <BR>I managed to get only one
    right: <BR> <BR><i>18. Who is the man in this picture? </i> <BR> <BR>My answer:

  body: 'For the record: Allan and I accumulated questions over a period of a couple
    months, sending them to each other every now and then. In the end, they all wound
    up in Allan&#39;s lap and he was responsible for the final cut. &#40;I just counted:
    twelve of the finals were mine.&#41; He put together the PowerPoint presentation,
    which I reviewed and offered a few corrections and suggestions. Then I created
    the printed questionnaire form. We met for about ten minutes Friday night to coordinate
    the presentation. It was fun. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d have to do screenshots from the
    PowerPoint presentation, which I still have a copy of. But I don&#39;t have PowerPoint
    &#40;I reviewed the presentation on a client&#39;s system.&#41; I&#39;ll see if
    I can come up with the images for you. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: Kent, I think the quiz was quite difficult... though I managed to score 18!
    <BR> <BR>The designer of Courier &#40;Bud Kettler&#41; really is a bit obscured...
    I should&#39;ve known that one; it was in my slab-serif paper! I managed to completely
    forget his name.

  body: 'Simon -- Thanks for the offer, really; but actually I have no desire to have
    PowerPoint on my system. No offense, I hope. <BR> <BR>Keith -- In restrospect,
    I agree, the quiz may have been a little obscure. What can I say? I&#39;m an old
    fogey deep down inside -- &#40;just ask Tiffany ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>In my defense,
    I think only three of mine were truly obscure. Well, and that #16 was pretty challenging;
    I think we should have scored partial points on that one. <BR> <BR>We&#39;ll just
    have to see what Will and Allan come up with for next year. But you might want
    to start keeping copies of Lawson and Bringhurst on your nightstand for bedtime
    reading. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

    application that will let you view PPTs without installing the full application.
    Might be just the thing for those screen shots. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com:80/office/000/viewers.asp"

  body: Nice. -- Kent is a handsome man. And I have to admit I walked down half a
    city block directly behind him because I thought Kent was older. My bad, completely
    my bad.

  body: Yes, the questions were easier last year &#40;eg &#34;Who designed Fontesque?&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Funny thing is, the quiz was really quite balanced, but there is just
    so much UNDEAD in typography. I really noticed that driving thru Northern Minnesota,
    visiting OLD NAVY, retail America with retro scripts from House and Font Diner,
    and the conservative press with fonts from HTF and the Bureau. And the Book Center
    exhibit on Bruce Rogers, I mean, imagine going to a software conference and there&#39;s
    a party in the Turing museum. <BR> <BR>Stephen, is your hair starting to thin...?
    Perhaps you will do better next year. <BR> <BR>
