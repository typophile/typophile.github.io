  or not (my memory's not what it used to be), but I've now got a much higher resolution
  copy of the logo, and was hoping someone out there might be able to help me identify
  the fonts in this, as what I <em>was</em> using now looks completely wrong.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Renaissance_4116.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  and all assistance is greatly appreciated!"
