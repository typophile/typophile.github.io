  Bruce Rogers before he designed Cenataur? I was talking to Kay Amert today and she
  said Blumenthal mentions them in his book on Bruce. I will try to get the book of

    by Bruce Rogers? Chicago: October House, 1949. Maybe this has some of that info
    on alternate sorts? I recall that in one part it talks about\u2014I think\u2014some
    alternate uppercase sorts For the Montaigne type that was Centaur's precursor.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure where you can get this book. A few years ago a bunch of copies came on
    the market. Maybe through APHA. I'd reckon some libraries with good holdings about
    type would have it. There was also an even smaller book about that type published
    by I cannot recall whom; sorry. Both of mine, like most of my type books, are
    buried away. I need a few hundred feet of new bookshelves in this old house.\r\n\r\npowers"

    recall any pre-centaur stuff in it but I may not be correct. \r\n\r\nI ceratainly
    know what you mean about shelves! And I just put in about 100 extra feet.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    there is a fairly new book called \"Humane Letters: Bruce Rogers - Designer of
    Books and Artist\" which may have information about it as well."

    definitely. What I am hoping to find is predictable if you have followed the topic
    of my posts. ;-) \r\n\r\nI am wondering if Bruce found that the type he had to
    work with had clashes or gaps and that he may have created an alternative sort
    to use instead for better fitting. If he did make alt letters that is just one
    of many reasons he may have done it. He could have also made an alternative swash
    or just tried to make a type look more even on the page or correct a poorly weighted
    S for all I know. But talking to Kay I started to get an idea that it might have
    been the case that the special cuts may have been to correct a fitting problem
    in existing type, and certainly Blumenthal might well have had a special interest
    in such things as well given his history with his own design: Spiral.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    I will also talk to the Author of Humane Letters today and see what he has to
    say. His name is Richard Landon. He works at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library
    in Toronto.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I checked all of the indexed citations for Centaur, but I'm not sure what
    Ms. Amert was referring to, since I found no reference to any kind of contextual
    alternates like you're interested in.\r\n\r\nThe closest I could come were the
    various references to the fact that the design had to be subtly altered when it
    was adapted for Monotype setting in a full range of sizes.\r\n\r\nHere is the
    most relevant quotation:\r\n\r\n\"Having the Centaur type cut has meant 3 or 4
    times the amount of work I anticipated -- besides all the unlooked-for delays.
    It was necessary to make 4 sets of patterns to cover the great range of sizes
    -- with individual modifications of certain letters, almost without number. The
    design called for so many departures from their usual practices that even after
    the first size was satisfactorily made, they were all at sea about the other sizes
    -- and I was equally so, except by experiment. So really I've made <em>four</em>
    types.\"\r\n\r\nThis is quoted from a letter to Carl Purington Rollins on 9 Feb
    1930. [from <cite>Bruce Rogers : A Life in Letters</cite> by Joseph Blumenthal,
    page 115; published by W. Thomas Taylor, 1989.]\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to bet that
    all the extra adaptation was as much BR's notorious perfectionism as anything
    else. That and struggling against the unitized constraints of Monotype. In other
    words, probably not the kind of contextual motivations you're looking for.\r\n\r\n--
    Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    book, but in BR's own <cite>Pi : A Hodge-Podge of Letters, Papers, Addresses,
    written during a period of 60 years</cite> [The World Publishing Company, 1953].\r\n\r\n\"The
    first cutting was admirably done by Robert Wiebking, of Chicago, and though certain
    modifications of the the design were made by him, they were in almost every instance
    improvements on my pattern. Several of the least satisfactory letters have been
    recut from time to time in the effort to better them.\" [pp. 55-56]\r\n\r\nThis
    is taken from a Printer's Note he wrote for the first book printed with the Monotype
    re-cutting of Centaur in 1929.\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems BR's revision of any Centaur
    glyphs is motivated by perfectionism, not contextual adaptation.\r\n\r\nOkay,

  body: "Thanks Kent! It does start to sound likely that Kay was conflating the two
    ideas. The other thing is that she didn't have any of the Centaur work in mind
    but rather extra glyphs for other people's existing types. This would have been
    pre-centaur. Still, it is also quite true that it may well turn out that he wasn't
    making something to be used contextually with the existing glyph but rather as
    a refinement as you have just described.\r\n\r\nMaybe there will be something
    in \"Humane Letters\". I'll let you know if anything turns up. \r\n"

    not going to try to run this down, but I'll reiterate my suspicion that if anything
    of this sort was done, it was along the lines of customizing the look of a face
    and improving perceived shortcomings, not contextual alternates. Something like
    what Porter Garnett requested with Van Krimpen's Lutetia when he wanted it for
    the Frick art collection catalog [see <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>, pp. 103&#150;04].\r\n\r\n--

  body: I have read the book "Humane Letters" now. It does mention numerous instances
    of customizing or tinkering but in no case is a contextual shape mentioned. It
    is a very nice book indeed with samples of nearly everything mentioned in the
    book. It is $30. Softcover. I will still talk to the author but I am not expecting
    to any surprises.

    his own types while he was working with them. Maybe he was tweaking stuff and
    trying it out along the way, which is why sometimes it seems like systematic use
    of alternate characters, but five lines later, it doesn\u2019t."

    then you would get more variation. And if you were to run short mid-composition
    and had to cast more, you might throw a tweak in on the way. \r\n\r\nIt seems
    to me though that those few Jenson's I have clapped my own eyes on, even when
    they held some variety, did also have a kind of \"cast of characters\" eg a1,
    a2, a3 and so on that had distinctive feature sets even through the haze of printing
    variables. \r\n\r\nStill, thats only what I *think* I see so far. And there is
    much more to investigation needed. "
