    Renko's call of Houschka would surely provide a good base font, probably the closest
    one (/M to be tweaked). Mixing [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/museo|Museo and
    Museo Sans]] plus some little tweaking could work as well. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima
    Nova]] even if top rounded /A needs to be reconstructed would be another option.
