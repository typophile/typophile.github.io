  body: The typeface designs of Roger Excoffon taken out of context--mid-Twentieth
    Century France--can be seen as somewhat bizarre. If you can find some images of
    France from that time period, well even today in some smaller towns, you'll see
    how perfect they were--and still can be I believe--when used well.
