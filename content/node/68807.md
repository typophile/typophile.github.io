  body: "Yes, the letters aren't Peignot. I was only looking at the \"52\".\r\nThe
    letters aren't Optima either though (looking at \"MOBILIZATION ZONE\") \u2013
    the angles of the \"M\" are different and the \"O\" has what looks like diagonal
    stress."

    seems to have similar shapes. I don't get the feeling that the lettering in the
    sample is quite so 'freehand' looking, but I can't think of a better stressed
    sans offhand.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    this mystery font (that we're maybe not even supposed to find ;-) has non-reversed
    stress in the \"Z\"."

  body: It's hard to tell for sure from such a tiny sample, but I think the mystery
    font is <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-syndor/">ITC Syndor</a>.
    The M, Z and other characters seem to match.

  body: "You could be right Mark, but I never thought to consider small serif fonts.
    I can't SEE any serifs at all, but the image is small. Some of the lower case
    that you can guess at seems consistent too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Hmm... Wrong font but the right type designer (Hans Eduard Meier). I think
    it's actually <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/barbedor/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D52%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DMOBILIZATION%2520Attack%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3D%26seed%3D19">Barbedor</a>.
    Meier designed several faces with similar structure, but different details.
