body: I'm working with Myriad Pro for a client- They would like to use that typeface
  for roman letters, but when making it italic- the a loses its ascender. Is there
  a stylistic alternative for this to change the a to look like its roman? I've looked
  through glyphs and can't seem to solve this.

    in their italics. You could always draw a custom version."

  body: "Yeah. I don't actually think that's a good thing. Apparently neither does
    Frutiger; when he and Kobayashi redrew it as Frutiger Next, they gave it a single-story
    italic \"a.\"\r\n\r\nMeighan, if you were a chef, and a client wanted you to serve
    vanilla ice cream with ketchup and vinegar to their guests, would you do so? You
    could point out to your client that most typefaces that have that property are
    thought of as \"oblique\" rather than italic, and that most typographers think
    obliques suck.\r\n\r\nT"
