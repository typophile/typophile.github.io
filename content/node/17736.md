  body: "Found this info on Typographica:\r\n\r\n\"Mobley is based on ten letters
    found on the cover of a 1960s Blue Note jazz album. The ten source letters were
    designed for film setting by Wayne Stettler as part of a single typeface published
    by VGC under the name Neil Bold. Mobley Sans and its condensed and serifed counterparts
    constitute a brand new design molded around those source letters.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: Too bad - Mobley Sans is missing some of the quirks of the original Neil Bold,
    such as the little hook where the bowl of the P joins the stem. And the cap E
    is completely different.

  body: The other font is an old film font called Alpha Midnight. No idea if there
    is a digital version.
