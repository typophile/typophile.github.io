  body: "Hi Michelle,\r\n\r\n[[Ondine]] was designed by [[Adrian Frutiger]]. \r\n\r\nDigital
    versions of Ondine can be purchased via a number of foundries. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/haas/ondine/familytree.html\">These
    versions</a> may vary, in terms of character count, quality, price, design details
    &c. There\u2019s also a version called \u2018Formal Script 421\u2019 by Bitstream,
    which is (now) legitimate (please someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong).\r\n\r\nThe
    free font \u2018Calligrapher\u2019 is an unauthorized rip-off of it. It\u2019s
    very rare that you can get a quality font for free. Most of the time, it\u2019s
    plain plagiarism. Read also the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/wiki/FAQ_free\">FAQ
    on free fonts</a>.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is: all they did is rename the font and
    change a few glyphs. The \u2018\xDF\u2019 is different, for example. And the \u2018Q\u2019
    is different from the version I have \u2013 which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean
    that those glyphs haven\u2019t been designed by Frutiger. They might have been
    included in other versions.\r\n\r\nAnd those ignorants flipped the \u2018H\u2019
    \u2013 great. Right: Calligrapher. Left: the original Ondine.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hh_4573.png]\r\n\r\nF"
