  body: I guess it's a custom job for Disney. Some people tried to identify it on
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=carol|WTF Forum]]. No perfect match,
    only a similar [[http://www.fontspace.com/fz/navidad|Navidad]] by Franco Fernbandez
    (which could even be a digitization attempt to reproduce the "A Christmas Carol"
    woodmark).
