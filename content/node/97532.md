  (Hons) Graphic Design. I am in the process of writing my dissertation, and my chosen
  question is: In what ways are free font license websites affecting the type design
  industry and professional type foundries?\r\n\r\nTo summarise I am going to investigate:\r\n-
  how and why have free font websites developed\r\n- opinions on free font websites
  and how often people use them.\r\n- the legality issues with font licenses to see
  what part this plays in the industry (commercial licenses, piracy and intellectual
  property)\r\n- the wider debate of amateur vs professional in a number of creative
  industries.\r\n- how it is affecting professional foundries\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm going
  to leave the subject open without questions, but I would really appreciate if you
  could briefly explain your views and opinion on the subject. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny reading
  recommendations would also be greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nCraig"

  body: "Are you making a clear distinction between free fonts with commercial licensing,
    such as those released by foundries to promote a larger family (e.g., [[http://www.exljbris.com/museo.html|Museo]]
    from Exljbris and [[http://www.stormtype.com/typeface-lido-s-t-f-condensed-bold.html|Lido]]
    from Storm), those which have no license or only a vague indication of how they
    can be used (e.g, \"Free for Personal Use\") and fonts which employ a range of
    established open source licensing models such as the SIL OFL, GNU GPL with font
    exception, Apache, MIT, etc...?\r\n\r\nAll of the above are frequently misused
    and misunderstood, particularly in commercial environments. Quality and integrity
    are major issues in all of these cases and no easy sweeping statements will cover
    every circumstance and eventuality. Also, as many people have pointed out in other
    threads, what retail costs may be saved by using \"free\" fonts are often picked
    up in other ways, such as time and effort in working around poor design and execution,
    and in many cases the realisation that there is a very good reason why people
    charge for licensing professional, beautifully crafted and engineered fonts."

  body: "There are free font sites that have only fonts that can legitimately be there,
    and there are \u201Cfree\u201D font sites that have a noticeable number of commercial
    fonts, illegally. The latter tend to really tick off the retail font designers
    and foundries.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the question should not be so much about
    the web sites (they are just a distribution mechanism) but the availability of
    free fonts. Mostly, they suppress the market for casual font purchasing, and reduce
    the market for inexpensive and semi-pro quality fonts. But they certainly do affect
    the total market. The degree of impact varies widely for each type designer and
    foundry. People who do a lot of commission work are relatively unaffected.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hi everyone\r\nMy apologies for the slow reply, and thank you for all your
    responses\r\n\r\nLet me try and respond to each reply:\r\n\r\n@oldnick that definitely
    summarises the research I have done so far. I was also going to try and research
    the wider debate of amateurism vs professional not only in design but also in
    photography, music etc.\r\n\r\n@Karl Strange at the moment I am just starting
    to work on the essay, so I am looking at both the different variations of fonts
    which are \"free for personal use\", but also the illegal use of commercial fonts
    through distribution such as sharing fonts with friends, downloading from torrent
    sites etc. I understand that this is really quite vague at the moment, but I am
    hoping through research the wider argument I can work down and focus on the most
    important section, and rewrite focusing on that.\r\n\r\n@Chris Dean thanks for
    your help, will make sure I credit properly throughout and in the bibliography\r\n\r\n@Thomas
    Phinney that's interesting, I didn't realise there were some that were distributing
    commercial fonts like that illegally. Can anybody point me in the direction of
    one of these sites (not to use obviously, but to name and shame in the essay.
    If this is not allowed on the forum then do not worry)\r\n\r\n@Nick Shinn That
    is a very good point, I am still in the early stages of writing, so am working
    quite broadly at the moment. Like you say, I feel like focusing on the shape and
    design of the type would be much more relavent to my studies. \r\n\r\n@hrant very
    interesting idea. The hunt for further research begins\r\n"
