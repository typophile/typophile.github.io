  body: "I haven't been able to figure out what category to search under. So far all
    I can say is that I found a few similar fonts. Closest at this point is Stuart
    Sandler's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/giggles-btn/|Giggles]] Bold.\r\n\r\nIt's
    possible this is a custom font, as it is an easy style to create by hand-drawing
    the letters.\r\n\r\n[For reference, I have searched at MyFonts under: Comic, cartoon,
    funny, informal, friendly and cute. I am now looking at free fonts.]\r\n\r\n-
