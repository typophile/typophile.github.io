  body: Don't understand which one you're exactly after but the one for "DE PASSEMENTE/ARIUS/COR"
    looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/webster|Webster]].

    body: Thanks for your reply. Sorry I wasn't clearer... I am looking the the big
      A font with the thick serif.

  body: "Engraved letterhead. No matches that I can see.\r\nLetters in DE PASSEMENTE/ARIUS/OR
    seem to be a bolded version of the letters in VILLEURSANNE.\r\nNote the generally
    boxy shapes of the letters and the broad serifs at the apex of A and the base
    of V. This was a design feature in several late 1890s typefaces\r\nI hesitate
    to recommend any digital substitute. But there is some remote similarity in Cushing
    Two by David Bergsland http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/cushing-two/\r\nThis
    is derived from an ATF typeface designed in 1897 by J. Stearns Cushing.  The bulging
    bowl on the P, and the extended drop on the lhs of M in PASSEMENTE, and  the extended
    leg on the R IN VILLEURSANNE and OR do not match the feel of the rest of the letters
    and seem to be titling flourishes. Note that the leg in the R of ARIUS is ends
    in a serifed flat terminal. The flourished letters are perhaps in the style of
    Solo's Webster [as found by Ryuk]. Webster is one of three very similar typefaces,
    the others are Lafayette and Washington, cut by Gustave F. Schroeder for Central
    in the 1890s.\r\nNor did I find an exact match for the initial letters M and C.
    But you would be part way there with P22 Kilkenny http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-kilkenny/
    based on Hermann Ihlenberg's Nymphic, patented  May 21, 1889, and sold by MS&J
    and later by ATF.\r\nDon"

    body: Wow! This is great information. Thanks for taking the time to give me in
      depth descriptions and links. What I am actually looking for seems much simpler...
      the font of the giant letter A. I have browsed all sorts of serif fonts and
      I find nothing of the quality that this one has... the thick slabs and the nicely
      curved edges of the serifs. Any ideas?

    body: "The Clarendon Condensed is very close. If I had more typography skills,
      I might be able to morph it into what I want. You will notice that the curves
      in the serifs on the letter A are quite graceful... almost swooping... and that
      the right side gets wider at the top instead of narrower as in Clarendon which
      makes the triangular cutout smaller.  This letter W has similar qualities I
      mentioned about the A... the gracefulness.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/W_5627.jpg]\r\nReading
      your earlier comments about the font on the letter, I see that I have so much
      to learn. I appreciate your taking the time to educate me and I welcome any
      further comments you wish to make."

  body: "Thak you Jeanne. The A & W still look like some version of Carendon to me.
    The grace of these versions may be due to the signmanker's adaptation of the design.
    Or there may be a Clarendon derived font that is a closer fit than the ones I
    mentioned.\r\nDon"
