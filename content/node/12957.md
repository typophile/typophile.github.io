  if this ends up a double post.\r\n\r\nStrange things are happening with the fonts
  on my iMac running MacOS 10.3.9 (and were happening previously). I cannot use Hoefler
  Text Ornaments in certain applications, particularly Word 2004. Any characters I
  type show up as empty squares.\r\n\r\nIf I try to use the HTO in TextEdit, it switches
  to Times. Bizarrely, it works fine in earlier versions of Word. The font looks completely
  normal in both Apple's Font Book and Lemke's FontBook application.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
  I recently downloaded a trial of Broadsheet (from www.texashero.com). In TextEdit,
  if I start out typing something in Broadsheet, it switches to Lucida Grande after
  about the 6th character entered. Or, if I type a bunch of text in another font,
  then try to switch it to Broadsheet, it all converts...except the e's.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas what is going on? I have tried flushing the Office font caches, but it has
  has no effect. I was hoping that my recent upgrade to Panther would (somehow) fix
  things, but that hasn't worked either.\r\n\r\nthanks for any suggestions you may
  have,\r\nvv\r\nJ.O."

      font has just several glyphs encoded as for Private Use. These glyphs are available

        on their description, I bet you're exactly right and that's what my problem
        is.\r\n\r\nThe only catch is that it says it was supposed to have been fixed

  body: i suspect that the issue with Broadsheet is that the e's are actually missing
    from the font. This is most likely what is causing it to revert to another font.
    If you want the e's you'll have to purchase the full version of the font.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback...I was wondering if I was just crazy.\r\n\r\nHoefler
    Text Ornaments does work completely normally in Word versions older than Word
    2004. If I open an older Word file that contains Hoefler ornaments with Word 2004,
    the ornaments revert to blank squares. It was that strange behavior in TextEdit's
    font palette that really seemed weird.\r\n\r\nSo if the glyphs are encoded for
    \"private use,\" you're not supposed to use them? The behavior doesn't just occur
    with one or two glyphs, it's any of the ornaments, which look like they're supposed
    to be accessible by ordinary means.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm really trying to determine
    is if this one font is corrupted (and if so, how to fix it) or if something more
    systemic is at work.\r\n\r\nAs for Broadsheet...d'oh! I hadn't even considered
    that the demo version might be crippled in that way. The behavior was so similar
    to the Hoefler strangeness that I assumed they were related phenomena. I'll try
    mailing the designer at texashero.com to verify.\r\n\r\nthanks again for the insight,\r\nvv\r\nJ.O. "

    I currently run Suitcase XI and 10.3.9 with continued adobefnt files (read: constant)

  body: "Quoting from the document (p. 13):\r\n\r\n\"In Mac OS X version 10.3.5, occasionally
    certain symbol/dingbats fonts do not display in certain applications. This problem
    was fixed with Mac OS X 10.3.6. A similar situation occurs when you are using
    a Unicode symbol/dingbat font within a Unicode-savvy application. An example of
    this is the Mac OS X font ZapfDingbats.dfont - which is a Unicode font - when
    used with TextEdit - which is a Unicode-savvy application - will result in the
    fond Lucida Grande being substituted for ZapfDingbats.dfont when you enter text
    with the keyboard.\r\n\r\nUnicode does not map symbol/dingbat characters to keyboard
    alphabet keys. Therefore, text entry...will result in 'invisible' text, blank
    boxes, or font substitution.\r\n\r\nTo display and use dingbat characters...use
    the Character Palette....\"\r\n\r\nThis sounds exactly like what I've seen. Since
    you're using Suitcase, you may be interested to know that the doc refers readers
    to the Extensis KB Article #1302204 (http://www.extensis.com/en/support/kb_article.jsp?articleNumber=1302204).\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I also have a PC where I do a lot of work...would you recommend buying Suitcase
    for managing fonts on it?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nvv\r\nJ.O."

    I can recommend Suitcase, but, I haven't used it on a PC in about a zillion years."
