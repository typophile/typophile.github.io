  body: "I have come to the conclusion that this is probably a custom font, made almost
    like a Western 'Ransom Note', with a mix of Western styles. I see at least three
    different A's and other letters also have more than one version. That could suggest
    that it is all hand-drawn, and not a font at all, but there are some duplicates
    that make me think this was a home-made font. I checked Dafont and looked at MyFonts
    for hand-drawn Western fonts, and there are a few similar fonts, like [[http://www.dafont.com/strongbox.font?fpp=100&text=RED+IGUANA+SALT+LAKE|Strongbox]]
    at Dafont (the S, G and C) or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/concave-tuscan/?refby=bowfin|Concave
    Tuscan]] at MyFonts, for the I, E, L and T, but even these are only similar. I
    think the designer was inspired by a variety of Western styles, but drew original
    versions based on these. Some letters are pretty crudely formed, suggesting an
    amateur effort, or at least one that looks that way.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
