  I have chosen the right concept for a company that wants to be a full line sporting
  goods store that provides a broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment,
  apparel, and footwear.  I was trying to make it look corporate and sporty at the
  same time.  Any suggestions as to what I should change?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/revision_3454.png]"

    Y a little more loosely.\r\n2. Add more spacing between the Y and S (the words
    bleed together way too much).\\\r\n3. Sporting Goods is tracked out way to much
    (I agree with Maxwell's reply.)\r\n4. More contrast between font choices. Maybe
    select a serif for Sporting Goods.\r\n5. The 2 lines are too thick, set them at
    half the stroke weight used.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this would be a great logo if
    this was a line of apparel, but I don't really see it working as well as logo
    for store. Considering the logo would have to work at sizes and in wide variety
    of applications. It's almost too clean, and equally lifeless. \r\n\r\nGet more
    clever, it's called Dynasty Sport, create a Crown logo with various sporting goods.
    Make a mark that would be easily remembered and recognized (think the bent staple
    in Staples.)"

  body: "This makes me think of two other brands: Paul Mitchell for the design & typeface
    and Nautica for the color.\r\n\r\nI'd modify something, even the Paul Mitchell
    logo is a modified version of Eurostile. It's almost a stencil font now, and the
    \"A\" is actually built from an upside-down \"U.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pm_logo_5707.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo
    something to make it unique and stand out from everything else, some kind of distinguishing
    mark. The Microsoft logo isn't all that amazing but it does have that little wedge
    taken out of the \"o,\" and that's something you remember.\r\n\r\n\"Sporting Goods\"
    does need to be a different font... it needs to be either the same face (or at
    least the same family) as \"DynastySports\" or a serif face.\r\nYou've got a good
    foundation; you just need to tweak it further. Have fun!"

  body: Did you try using Eurostile for "Sporting Goods" as well? I'm not a big fan
    of mixing two sans serif fonts, and the simplest solution seems to me to use the
    same font for both lines.

    a little too much personality but the squarishness might work.

  body: I agree with Patty. Try Eurostile/Microgamma for Dynasty Sport and regular
    Eurostile for Sporting Goods. An other good idea I've found to work a lot of time
    is to use two typefaces by the same designer. Because they're designed by the
    the same person the sensibilities of the faces are usually very close. Take a
    look at some Novarese's serif faces.

  body: "Like Brad said, it's all Nautica and Mitchell right now. Get some motion
    into it; it feels awfully static for a sporting goods identity. I think you might
    even try something as subtle as a playful baseline for the DYNASTYSPORT, and then
    go serif for the second line.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: the super-tracked U&lc looks
    amateurish. A different face, an all-cap setting -- maybe even a hand-script if
    you want the extra width -- would work better."

  body: "Hmm. I'm not loving the cap/small cap look - even tho I realize they aren't
    exactly the same (the \"small caps\" being extended). The caps  look squooshed
    and the weights don't match. You also have a problem with those two G's and the
    awkward space under the cap S. I think a rule between the two lines might help.
    Something just looks off-balance here. Your kerning/tracking on the second line
    isn't good either, especially in \"goods\". Maybe there's some sort of symbol
    you can use between the G's that will relate somehow to the S above them? I'd
    also suggest not tracking the second line to the width of the top line, let it
    be shorter and centered.\r\n\r\nI like your first logo better, even tho it does
    remind me of other existing logos."

    It looks like some sort of poorly painted antique wood shelf I'd put 4th place
    trophies on. I would go back to black and white, track down 'sporting goods' and
    give it a bit of breathing room off the 'd..sports' baseline. Never let meaningless
    embellishments, which are confusing, steer your design.\r\n\r\nACK "

  body: "I know you have only shown us 3 examples, but it seems like you don't have
    a concept. It seems like you are just trying to decide on a typeface. I would
    suggest stepping away from the computer and doing a lot of sketches with a pencil
    and paper. Also, do a lot of research of competitor's logos.\r\n\r\nA resource
    is the Logo Design Workbook.\r\n\r\nBe aware of the image the company wants to
    portray--energetic, fun, sophisticated, expensive, discount. Also be aware that
    the logo will be used on exterior signage on the side of the building and in newspaper
    ads. Right now your concepts would not work effectively as signage. "
