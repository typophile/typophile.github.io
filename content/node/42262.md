  It's perfect for my title on front cover of a book, but I've discovered there are
  no apostrophes, hyphens or colons so I can't really use it throughout the book for
  chapter headings.\r\n\r\n(I have a funny feeling it was an amateur experiment because
  it looks like impact with a distressed stamp effect). \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where
  I can find a full set of this font (I've tried the usual suspects like myfonts with
  no luck), or suggest a good alternative? \r\n\r\nMany thanks!"
