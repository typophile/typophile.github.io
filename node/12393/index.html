<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So I've been putting some serious hours into Typophile these days. Even on the days where I get some 'real' work done at the office, I come home and hack away to the wee hours of the morning. Sad, sad, sad—but oh so fun. It sounds like most people are liking what they see so far. Of course there are still some serious gaps. Image uploads for comments for example, are still missing, and inline display of image attachments needs to be addressed. Right now the primary concern is some server performance issues. Now that we've made it through the initial trampling at launch, we've been able to make a few tweeks and optimizations to speed things up a little, but we've got a ways to go before the site is snappy and crisp like we like it.
The most problematic areas right now are the forum listing pages. There are some pretty gnarly database queries there that are really gobbling processor cycles. As soon as we start caching some of those queries we should see a pretty good boost in speed.
Then there are the mysteriously absent moderator posts: somehow the import script I wrote decided that the moderator posts weren't that important and ignored them completely. Needless to say, Stephen is <a href="http://typophile.com/node/12063?from=100&comments_per_page=50#comment-71355">pretty sad</a>. Don't worry, though. They aren't dead, just sleeping. They'll be back shortly.
Of course, there are quite a few features in the wings, not the least of which is a 'Google' style search with sweet +-"" etc. operators. For now, though, I'm going to sleep.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The mind of a perfectionist is a difficult thing to manage. By nature, one who suffers from this problem doesn't find sleep easy until the project is perfect. ;^) Great work. Love the new site already.
Christian, not sure what Stephen means. Unless I wasn't really a moderator before. All of my posts still exist. <em>Am I missing something?</em></div>
