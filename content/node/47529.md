    really <em>really</em> want that font, this means it is worth at least <em>something</em>
    to you. But on the other hand by asking us where you can download it for free,
    you actually say it's worth nothing to you. What is it? Is this typeface worth
    something to you, or nothing? Make up your mind fer chrissakes! :^/"

    Heck, that's, like, what, less than a Euro! :^P I'm sure you can pay that amount
    for such a beautiful and unique typeface.
