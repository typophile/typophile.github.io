  practices in commercial law.\r\n\r\nIt has to represent confidence, professionalism,
  and quality. \r\n\r\nThese are the ideas I have produced so far.\r\n\r\n(the ones
  with the stars are the ones I like best)\r\n\r\nAny advice anyone culd give me would
  be appriciated. And I don't expect to have design made more me (i would hate that),
  but I would like some help on making an original and powerful logo.\r\n\r\nThank
  You :)"

  body: "It looks like you are going for a type treatment, but instead of playing
    with type variations, you're just randomly putting boxes and lines all over the
    place.\r\n\r\nGet rid of those for now, and focus on the type. See what you can
    come up with just with some different type treatments.\r\n\r\nAnd do NOT use a
    gavel or scales of justice...unless you want the logo to look like the logo that
    90% of all legal related businesses have.\r\n\r\nAlso, what is SW and Computer
    Law? "

  body: "I would avoid using a typeface that doesn't have genuine small caps. I would
    also avoid making any play with \xA9 copyright symbols. At the moment I am drawn
    to the sans version (not that it particularly strong and the rule is out of position,
    but the perception that serif equals professional/quality need not be true). My
    first thought on the name is that it gives you the opportunity to work with it,
    using the white areas of type, embossing, for example which might be a direction
    worth exploring.\r\nTim"

    levels of importance to your graphic elements. What you have now doesn''t communicate
    anything that is dominate or subordinate. I also agree SW and Computer Law needs
    explaination. Remember good communication isn''t about design for design sake. '

  body: "Thanks for the comments. I am finding it ard to focus on what is being asked
    of me.\r\nThe name of the company is White SW Computer Law.\r\nI believe a modern
    font is the way to go, personally. But the ones I want to use you have to buy.
    Which I think isn't worth it if it's for school. \r\nYou are right about the law
    icons I have been exploring with. It's cheesy. But I did want to explore other
    areas. \r\nThe \"type treatment\" (i'm still not familiar with the lingo yet,
    so I hope I used it right) are basicly what other law firms have as thier logo.
    \r\nAnd the boxes and lines serve a purpose, but I understand it may not communicate
    as well as I had hoped.\r\nI would like to make something unqiue/original yet
    still communicate professional, confidence, and experience. \r\nAny ideas of where
    to look for inspiration, or maybe a better way to think about the problem? I can
    tell right now I'm thinking inside the aquare.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I did a google search for White Computer Law which revealed <a href=\"http://www.computerlaw.com.au/index.html\">this</a>,
    which is a clear indication as to why they need a new logo, or anything really.
    But it does indicate that you can drop the SW (which seems to stand for Steve
    White) so you are left with White, Computer Law with a clear hierarchy.\r\nTo
    get out of the square think about what a logo should achieve. For example, you
    might believe its primary task is to differentiate/identify it from competitors.
    Therefore, looking at the competition is only a tool, you don't have a client
    to deal with (who may say \"we want a logo that looks like Browns Law Firm\" or
    that \"Times Roman is the only font we will use\"), so you have a free hand. White
    is the unique feature of the name, so you could think about white objects that
    communicate the qualities that you are after for example an egg or a square (these
    are instant subjective choices, yours might/should be better), or how to represent
    white using colours that you can print. You may decide that you only want a type
    treatment for the logo, but rather than just typing out different fonts try sketching
    layouts and then go through type catalogues to pick a font that has the qualities
    you want and will work well with your layout. It is sometimes difficult to sit
    in front of a computer and put down ideas quickly, erasing sections, re-drawing
    etc, the time lapse tends to slow your speed of thought. If when you have finished
    sketching and chosen a font that you really want to use you can always e-mail
    the foundry and ask if they can help you. Alternatively buying a font need not
    be a huge expense and if you have chosen well, you will use it more than once,
    think of it as an investment.\r\nTim"
