  body: "Love how Frode's face is coming along, but I'd call it more warm and antique,
    not so much aggressive. \r\n\r\nWhat about something more <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/square_sans_serif/\">square</a>
    like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/dispatch_stainless/\">Stainless</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_cube_ot/\">FF
    Cube</a>?"

  body: True, Steph. I'm designing it as a headline face. Plenty of punch and quirks.
    Might be to quirky for sports. Anyway, I wouldn't use anything from me quite yet:)
    There's still a long way to go on consistency.
