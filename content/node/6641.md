  body: It looks like a Squooshed version of Helvetica, but I&#39;m not sure where
    the angled terminal of the &#39;e&#39; is coming from.

  body: Nah, just <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/arial/narrow/testdrive.html?s=Costume+Design+Featurette&amp;p=48">Arial
    Narrow</a>. Maybe bold, not sure.

  body: We have a winner! <BR> <BR>Cheshire Dave, thank you! <BR> <BR>It is indeed
    Arial Narrow &#40;Bold&#41; - I thought it looked like Arial, tried Narrow but
    didn&#39;t make it bold. <BR> <BR>Just tried it and it&#39;s a perfect match.
    <BR> <BR>Yet again, fabulous results from an excellent forum. Thank you! <BR>
    <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>Matt
