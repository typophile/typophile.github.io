  and would appreciate any advice. Only requirement is 8.5x11 (supplemented with a
  grad school application/portfolio). The only thing I won't budge on is Chaparral
  Pro. It's the writer's font of choice (no, I'm not the poet).\r\n\r\nProgress so
  far: http://www.vervesix.com/alex-12_05.pdf\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it's good, thats
  why I'm here! There seems to be an art to setting poetry that has evaded me.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCasey"

  body: "Poetry setting is definitely a different animal than most other typography.
    \r\n\r\nI think that you have done a nice job.\r\n\r\nOne possible criticism:
    You haven't had any long lines that exceed your margins. If you do, you may want
    to consider a) moving your left margin further left, and b) consider how you would
    handle those issues.\r\n\r\nIt's just me, but I would move the left margin anyway.
    The first page looks good, but some of the longer lines on the other pages look
    a little unbalanced to me.\r\n\r\nOnly real problem I see: The first page uses
    vertical dots between the title and the text. The other pages don't have this
    device. "

    chunk of space separating the numbers and the text, so the periods are redundant.
    Also, try working a little color\u2014maybe just the titles and possibly section
    numbers in red\u2014those poems lean toward melancholic, so a little warmth might
    do the pages some good. If the final version is going to include pages numbers,
    add those now so you don't have to redesign around them later."

  body: "My pet peeve every since Bringhurst enlightened me is the inclusion of the
    Th ligature along with the normal ones (ff, fl, fi, etc.) in most of Adobe's pro
    fonts. If you like it, keep it in, but I find it distracting (see the title of
    \"The Diner\" for an example of where it crops up). The only way I know of correcting
    it without removing the other ligs is to select the Th's and uncheck \"Ligatures\"
    in the character palette.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I agree with the others -- very
    nice work!"

  body: "Thank you all for the kind words.\r\n\r\n>David, I can see what you mean
    about the left margin, I will probably end up nudging that over a few mm. Re:
    the vertical dots. I wasn't sure how to work them into The Diner, but they were
    left off of the last page via lack of sleep. Thanks for catching that.\r\n\r\n>James,
    I think you're right about the periods. If the author agrees, they will go. Some
    color would be a nice touch, but I have no control over how these will be printed,
    and for that reason chose black & white. I neglected to ask if page numbers were
    required, as they weren't in the document supplied to me. Would probably be a
    good question to ask.\r\n\r\n>Reed, from time to time I notice a few bothersome
    ligatures as well. This one never caught my eye, but now that you mention it,
    the ligature seems to have ostracized the 'e' from the word. Thanks for the advice
    & compliment.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCasey"
