  though I could be mistaken. One of the faces looks similar to Futura and Century
  Gothic and the other I'm not sure may be closer to an Optima style.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  figure these out?"

    It was used in the 1930s\u201350s. Not so much in the \u201970s as it probably
    didn\u2019t make the jump from metal to film."

  body: Thanks Stephen! Now to see if I can find what the second is. I may have to
    just redraw it for my purposes if there is no typeface like it.
