    body: The font 'Diamond' appears to be the one that is used for the Prada logo,
      so it's definitely found it's use in an upper-class context.

    Rich. \r\n\r\nI think it said somewhere that the price would be $299. Because
    it\u2019s the same price as Chalet and Neutra, it\u2019s easy for me to remember.
    I guess I could be wrong."

    And the Engravers fonts are nice.\r\n\r\nAre their any other font options though?
    Didot is of course nice but its seems like the default font for \"classy\". Looking
    for something maybe a little less used for that.\r\n"

    body: Stefan, would you happen to be working on a thin version of Stalemate? I
      mean even lighter in weight than the Light version? I'm working on a magazine
      redesign, and a very light weight sans is one of the requirements. I like Stalemate
      and am going to consider Anziano and Delicato as text faces. Beautiful work!

  body: "ahh thanks stephen. It is easier to view the fonts at that site. \r\n\r\nOne
    thing that I don't get with the expensive orange set is how are you supposed to
    know if that font will look good with the brand name you are creating? Without
    a letters-setter like most foundaries have, not only can I not see how the font
    will look with the company name, but how do i show it/ sell it to the client?\r\n\r\nI
    mean I could just tell them I found a font i want to use and that they have to
    pay for before seeing, but I wouldn't do that without me seeing it first either.
    Not to mention it would be a lot easier to sell them on buying an expensive font
    if I could actually show how it will look."

    try it before you buy, or maybe get help in setting some headline or something
    - to be able to see it little better. I think these possibilities should always
    be availbable. As you said, it's a greater chance to buy the font if you can try
    it a little bit first - and get convinced.\r\n\r\nBtw, I know Stefan is helping
    potential buyers like this sometimes - so if you want to see some headline or
    something of Stefan's wonderful fonts - he may very well be able to help you in
    some way. \r\n"

  body: "Ha that's kind of funny. It's kind of confusing though. I mean they are nice
    fonts I think, and even if they are expensive for the sake of being expensive
    it fits a marketing niche. But the fact that they started off as a joke kind of
    takes away from its prestige i think.\r\n\r\nThanks Goran thats a good idea, for
    smaller type foundaries i suppose i can just email then for a screenshot or something."

    in mind for Stalemate... The primar thing to do, is adding on some Small Caps
    to the excisting weights. Later on I will expand the family with more weights
    as well. This will include lighter weights. Anything is possible though depending
    if you're willing to concider a custom version as a faster soloution for your
    magazine redesign? Please contact me through e-mail (stefan@macrhino.com) and
    we could discuss the destials etc."

    doing high end jewellry but ended up going with a custom mark based off URW Imperial,
    which is also very nice.
