  body: I think it's quite possible that it was lettered by hand. Setting metal type
    on a curve, and reversing it, was practically impossible. <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-magnesium/">Magnesium</a>
    is a digital font with a similar style.

  body: "There were a million+ of these made.  AC Spark plug used this font from the
    late 30's till early 50's on oil filters, air cleaners etc, and were screen printed
    on water slip decals.\r\n\r\nI though it was simply Arial but the M and N have
    vertical legs, and the S E and B are different.  \r\n\r\nAre you saying that this
    might have been a font they drew up 'in house'?\r\n\r\nAre there any sources for
    30's and 40's era fonts?\r\n"

  body: "I'm pretty familiar with what fonts were around in the '30s or '40s and I
    can't think of any that would match this. However, it was a very common <em>lettering</em>
    style, and lettering artists were a dime a dozen back then. \r\n\r\nThis is a
    typical example of the kind of thing that would have been lettered (drawn by hand)
    rather than set with type. Type (fonts) were not well suited for stuff like this.
    The lettering style would not usually match any particular font. \r\n\r\nAs I
    mentioned above, Magnesium is similar. There may be others, but that was the first
    one to come to mind."

  body: "You can search at MyFonts using '1930s' or '1940s' as the keyword. Remember,
    lots of pre-digital era typefaces didn't make it into digital form, but there
    have been plenty of them that have, and there have been revivals of some of the
    display types from that period, usually by new names.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Also, there are quite a few fonts around now inspired by hand lettering from
    back then. A lot of what you'll find, following Mike's advice, will be fonts like
    that.\r\n\r\nOne other possibility is that AC hired a company like Photo-Lettering
    Inc. to set type on a curve using their photo-lettering machines. P-L did have
    some styles like this (I think--I don't have one of their catalogs handy), which
    were based on lettering styles. Not many of these have been digitized, though.
