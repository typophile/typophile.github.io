  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, 

I am a graphic designer who has worked in the web for the past 10 years, which makes me really old :( Anyway, I have set up my own web design studio after working for the past few years as a freelancer, I need some business cards, usually, I would turn to a graphic designer to do these for me, since I have next to no print experience, problem is, I have a limited budget so I am left to do them myself. 

I have a good understanding of grid systems, white space etc. even typography to a certain degree, the problem I have at the minute is deciding on a serif font to use for my cards, one that will compliment my logo (which is set in the rather conservative helvetica).

My website, which is not finished at the minute, uses Georgia effectively (I think anyway), here is a holding page:

http://www.blend.uk.com/

So what I am looking for is recommendations for a nice serif font to use in print.

I have attached a first draft business card design (front) that uses Garamond, I quite like the font actually, but not sure how it will hold when I come to do the reverse of the card, solely in Garamond.

Appreciate any help, guidance, tips etc.

Thanks
Lee </div>

You can also add a trap weight stroke to the type, like .018 pt for example, and give the ink a little room to encroach.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the back of the card the type is reversed out of the brown too? If you like Garamond, Adobe Garamond is a little heavier than many cuts and would hold up better. Is your card stock going to be uncoated, coated both sides, or coated on the front only? You'll get more ink bleeding into the text on uncoated and you'll want even the finest strokes of the text to be sturdy enough.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Gary, 

Thanks for the help, I have used Garamond for the front and Adobe Garamond for the back. This is probably something I shouldn't do since they are two different fonts (although very similar). I do prefer the original Garamond at large sizes, i.e. for the main heading on the front, the lowercase g for me was a little more curvy if that makes sense...

The options I have for the card is:

Laminated
Un-Laminated
Luxury Matt Lamination

...and its 400gsm both sides with the same finish both sides.

The finish I envisaged originally, which I don't think I will be able to get with the options I have, is a rough finish, or as close as possible... nothing shiny, recycled almost.

Looking at my old Pantone Swatch book, I'd say the solid uncoated would be best, but again, not sure for the price if I will have much of an say.

Thanks
Lee</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have the front paragraph and all of the back set in Adobe Garamond Pro now, with the comments on adding a trap weight stroke, would a good alternative be to use the semi bold weight instead, I know I wasn't using this type before but the semi bold seems to add just enough on the front.

Also, would you recommend the same approach for the back, replacing all text with semi bold, and I suppose upping the semi bold already used to bold. 

Thanks

With this sort of printing you want to eliminate any chance for the printer to goof. You might inquire about the line screen. 175 or above has a much better chance of keeping the skinny bits from closing up. Also, when choosing the color, fewer plates is better. So if your CMYK mix has less than 5% of any color you might consider reworking the mix to eliminate a color.

Ask about minimum coverage percentages. The light screens could be an issue for the printer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, 

Thanks for comments, I have actually been working on this for a few hours and now have a back to the card and an additional front to consider. For the additional front, I have added some text to explain what I do and tried (I emphasize the word tried) to give it a nice typographic edge. I am probably not nearly experienced enough to pull this off, maybe some people can help me out. 


jupiterboy: when you mention not having multiple process screens, would that be in relation to printing companies who offer full cmyk colour prints, because of my budget, I and time restraint, looks like I am going to have to use such a company.

Thanks

		<div class="commentbody">One thing to keep in mind when designing a two-sided business card is that only one side will be visible at once.

When you hand it to the person, it is easy to turn it over to see the other side, but remember that many, many cards get placed in folders or rolodexes, and in these cases only the one side shows.

You want to make sure that at least one side includes all the important information that might make a customer call you, rather than the guy on the next card.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you're worried about legibility on the back why don't you try reversing the colors - having the green as the background color, with brown type. If that's the direction you work in, you can stick with regular which is nicer than semi-bold.

People still use rolodexes?</div>
