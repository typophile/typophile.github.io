  y.alt glyph, but the new one doesn't. I've removed the y.alt glyph, and have done
  my best to find and remove all reference to this glyph in the OT features, but when
  I try to compile the features I get an error saying the y.alt glyph is missing.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a way to search the entire file for any reference to y.alt? I've looked everywhere
  and can't seem to find what's causing the error."

    file, searched that, and there it was.
