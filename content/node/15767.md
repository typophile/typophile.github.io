  .\r\n\r\nI return to these Hallowed Halls in search of true Typographic Expertise
  . . . \r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nIn the September issue of FRIEZE magazine
  ( contemporary art ) I noticed a striking typeface which seems to come in quite
  a few flavors . \r\n\r\nThe cover of the magazine ( seen here - http://www.frieze.com/
  ) seems to have an OUTLINED version of the typeface. The INTERIOR of the magazine
  uses a SERIF and SANS SERIF version of the same / or similar / typeface . \r\n\r\nI
  have faith in the Typophile community. \r\nPlease let me know where I might learn
  more about this typeface .\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED IMAGE . . . .\r\n\r\n.

  body: "have you tried emailing Gerard Unger with an image and asking him directly?
    it IS his style under no doubt ... \r\n\r\nNot sure how this could help, but if
    you apply a white (thick enough) stroke to, say, Coranto, you get really similar
    results. But I agree the sample shown looks way too polished and refined to be
    suspected of such trivial origin."

    (Paul's name has come up recently on this site because of his collaboration with
    Christian Schwartz on the new Guardian typefaces.)
