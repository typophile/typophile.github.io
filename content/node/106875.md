  body: "Can't find match and really doubt there's one. This might be hand-drawn,
    by [[http://www.madebyband.com/portfolio-item/lowbrau-beirhalle|Band]] (try asking).
    Actually, after having a [[http://www.lowbrausacramento.com/LB_FoodMenu_2413.pdf|closer
    look to this woodmark]], outlines look very irregular, more irregular than what
    could be seen on this pictures. May be they started from a font and manually roughened
    it in order to communicate also this rustic/hand-made/unique/raw feeling through
    the mark itself.\r\nSome in the same vein: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/antartida|Antartida
