body: "Moving from Windows to Mac. \r\nI have a fairly large font library (adobe font
  folio, URW collections, Berthold collections, Linotype OT Libraries, OurType, Insigne,
  DSType, etc...). In Windows, I used FontExpert, which read from the corresponding
  folders for each library. I activated specific fonts as needed.\r\nBut OS X seems
  to place fonts in various folders... I think I understand the design of that.\r\nOn
  MBpro, using FontExplorer Pro, which I have organized the various Mac, office mac,
  and adobe fonts into 'required' and 'other' sets. Cut activated fonts from 744 to
  280.\r\n\r\nNow, ready to bring over my personal font library... and wanted to ask
  what the best strategy is for this.\r\n\r\n1. Do I create individual 'folders' for
  each library (adobe, linotype, urw, etc), and then from the amassed library, create
  'sets' (serif, sans-serifs, etc.) for the typefaces/fonts that I use the most ?\r\n\r\n2.
  Which folder should I keep my font library (I keep backups on an external drive
  and in the cloud) ?\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any guidance...\r\n\r\nThanks"

    for you.\r\n\r\nI organize mine alphabetically, with subfolders for families.
    I use Suitcase and have three permanent sets I use: Basics, which is the Base
    35 Printer Fonts, Pi fonts and fonts I use every day; Temporary, which are job-specific;
    and System, which is all System fonts. That makes it really easy to keep a clean
    installation of fonts."

  body: Has anybody ever heard of anyway to organize installed fonts into folders
    for windows?  So when I open the font menu in Corel or Illustrator I can see folders
    of fonts which I could create and name as I like, such as a "Brush Script" folder,
    a "text" folder, etc?

  body: Extensis (maker of the Suitcase Fusion application) has a PDF discussing the
    best practices for font management in OS-X. Even though you use a different app
    for font management you might still find portions useful.   http://www.extensis.com/downloads/font-management-best-practices-guides/
