    ligatures?)

  body: "Using WhatFontIs:\r\nAs far as shapes go, <a href=\"http://www.ffonts.net/Sci-Fied-2002.font\">Sci
    Fied 2002</a> (Andreas Nylin) is a look-a-like, except for the 'N'.\r\n\r\nRay
    Larabie's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/neuropol-x/\">Neuropol
    X</a> has sort of the same vibe.\r\n\r\nNothing with an N quite like this, and
    nothing with the elaborate ligatures.\r\nCan you tell where you got your sample?
    That might help."
