  body: The tail of the "a" flips up more on Century. Also the lowercase c curls up
    and in more. Unless it is a basterdized Century.

  body: "After further looking I think I want to change my focus to Modern. See these

    Modern 216</a>. The 'g' is much closer, and it would be almost perfect if the
    tails were shorter.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
