  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">It would be a great help to know, how much would i charge for designing a book by project (not by per hour). Charging by per hour are just minor changes. We cant keep track by charging the whole idea and design by per hour nor by per page. The book size is 280(h)x280(w)mm and pagination from  200-250pgs with hard cover. 

Content for Quotation and how much:
1. Proposal on Concept Approach
2. Consultation on Concept
3. Design layout typography
4. Scan, photoshop, Illustrations/tracings graphics, search for stock images
5. Content Editing / Proofreading

Please do let me know if i missed out anything or whats the best idea.
Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience.

regards,
Martin</div>

I have designed a few self-published books for clients, and the prices have varied considerably depending on the details of the project and other factors including how easy or difficult I thought the client was going to be to work with.

Charges for any design project are based on your time (your hourly fee multiplied by number of hours) and expenses. So you need to estimate how many hours you expect the project to take. Yes, that can be difficult. If others here suggest specific prices, keep in mind that design pricing can vary considerably depending on the details of the project, your level of expertise, and the prices other designers charge in your area.

> Proofreading

Even if you (or a proofreader you hire) are proofing the project, be sure to specify in your contract that the CLIENT is ultimately responsible for proofreading and signing off on the project before it's printed.

		<div class="commentbody">Abattis, I'm a graphic designer, not a type designer. But most clients want a quote or estimate at the start of the project, so I estimate how many hours it'll take and what my expenses will be (photography, illustration, mileage if I need to attend meetings, printing if billed to me, etc). Something like this:

Design   $x
Production $x
Expenses (listed individually) $x
Revision #1  $x
Revision #2 $x
Revision #3 $x
and so forth.

Revisions are often a significant amount of the total, especially in large projects. I just finished a routine project for a corporate client that had 5 rounds of revisions; occasionally I've had 8 or 9 rounds.

I hate the process of making estimates, but it's part of the job. It's much easier when you've done similar projects in the past and can check your records to see how long they took.</div>
