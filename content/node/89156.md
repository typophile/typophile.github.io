  17, 2012.\r\n\r\nDezcom Typefaces is proud to announce the release of \"Dez Yinznat
  Stencil,\" a tough typeface with an industrial quality. \r\n\r\n\"Dez Yinznat\"
  is a condensed stencil Opentype-savvy sans serif inspired by the industrial city
  of Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Stencil type was often used in the steel mills, scrap metal
  yards, railroads, warehouses, and other industrial institutions of Pittsburgh and
  is almost a signature for the City. \r\n\r\nThe name comes from combining two colloquial
  expressions common to Pittsburgh. \"Yinz\" is used there like \"You'all\" is used
  in Southern States. \"n'at\" or sometimes \"N@\" is used to replace \"and that\"
  when ending a phrase. \r\n\r\nThe designer, Chris Lozos, says, \"Pittsburgh was
  a true melting pot in my youth. My grandfather grew up in Greece and worked in the
  steel mills in Pittsburgh along side every other ethnicity. There \"broken English\"
  was the norm. Accents mingled and got mangled. Somehow, out of it all, came this
  odd dialect. Pittsburghese is not a very pleasant sounding departure from the norm
  but it befits hard times, hard work, tough conditions and a brotherhood of nationalities
  all bound together with the hope that the quitting time whistle would blow soon
  and they could rest\u2014at least until their next shift.\"\r\n\r\nThis font is
  dedicated to the hard-working people who made steel then and now. From Homestead
  Works, Pittsburgh and other American mill towns from Gary south to Birmingham and
  across the Atlantic to Europe's Hamburg, Sheffield, Pra\u017Esk\xE1, Ko\u0161ice,
  Li\xE9ge, Smederevo, and more.  \r\n\r\nis now available through MyFonts at:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dezcom/dez-yinznat-stencil/\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright
  2012 by Chris Lozos and Dezcom\r\n"

    made--to suit the cutting equipment, and make it abit more personal.

    charm of the rest of the character set (I like the ampersand, but the @ and #
    have some quite clinical cuts.)\r\n\r\nAll in all a nice approach to industrial
    stencil type."

    banged up looking stencils out there to be had.  I was looking for a face that
    had broader usage than just that.  I was trying for use in high-tech and clean,
    modern subjects as well.  The basic steel industry has faded a great deal but
    cities have replaced their molten pours with extruded and technological production
    of materials, n@."

  body: "Nick,  The cuts in stencils are used where needed to account for trapped
    areas and problematic angles that could lift and tear in application.  Where letters
    do not have these issues, cuts that just occur for style are counterproductive
    (excuse the pun).  Having tried cuts on some of the glyphs you mentioned,it became
    clear that readability was reduced far too much just for a certain style or \"Look\".\r\n\r\nI
    chose to stay closer to what worked best as an entire alphabet rather than what
    some might prefer stylistically.   Being too concerned about style makes me very
    nervous.  When the \"Look\" trumps the \"Need\", style is always the loser in
    my eyes."
