  body: Sorry for interruption; what do you mean with "highly legible blackletter"?
    Something more "Latin" looking, or s.th. like a simplified version of this particular

    is pretty clean e.g. highly legible \u2013 so something down this alley if it
    is custom. \r\n\r\nThanks for reply!"

    story about Carm\xE9n\xE8re in Chile</a>... Veddy eenteresting! Thanks!\r\n\r\nI'm
    a big fan of the Concha y Toro Cabernet, but I've tried the Merlot a couple of
    times as well. Now I will go looking for the Carm\xE9n\xE8re...  :-)"

    about two dozen more blackletter fonts at the site."
