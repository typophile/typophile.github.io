  body: It's Bernase Roman, an early ITC face. As far as I know there is no digital
    version.

    it (it says it''s a commercial font). If there is, I couldn''t find it in the
    cacophony of come-ons and irrelevant info. '

  body: I suspected that. They used to carry a lot of "lost" ITC faces. Most of those
