  body: "[[http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/Ox_Baker|Douglas \"Ox\" Baker]] won
    the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship in 1977, which is probably what the T-shirts
    pictured here refer to. In the 7os, custom messages on T-shirts were most often
    produced with iron-on letters designed and made for that purpose. They weren't
    copied from any specific font designed for typesetting, although they often resembled
    workhorse bold sans-serifs like Franklin Gothic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks! I remember the iron on letter and T-shirt booths in mall kiosks.
    I was hoping some one may know the name of the octagonal Machine knock-off font.
    I've seen a few on line with names like \"Hockey font\", \"Rock It,\" and on this
    thread http://typophile.com/node/80815 but there are a few characters on the shirts
    which I can't find anything like (e.g. R, #, &). I'm still hoping. \r\n\r\n"
