    sharp knives. I&#39;m surprised I still have all my fingers.'

  body: My first NYC job was as a bullpen production artist in a type shop. A pile
    of boards to work on with the studio manager giving you deadlines like &#34;I
    need this by 10, the next one by 10:20, after that make sure this one is done
    by 11:15&#34;. Pretty much like that all day long. <BR> <BR>As to knives, I was
    a single edge razor blade man myself. After I &#34;caught &#34; by my Xacto knife
    as it rolled off my desk.  Single edge blades were the best, you could put them
    in your mouth while you adjusted something on the board, and you always knew where
    they were. <BR> <BR>As to Rapidograph pens. They were actually high-tech if you
    started out using a ruling pen.

  body: I remember cutting rubylith for spot color to go to the newspapers. I remember
    photocopying art and waxing it up on the old Ad Age mags. I remember cutting the
    tip off of my finger on a last cut for an insert and the blood that made it so
    I had to re-do some of it.  <BR> <BR>I kinda miss the smell of melting wax. <IMG

  body: One of my first gigs was helping out on a liberal weekly paper back in Anchorage
    in the 70s, at which my mother was a contributing editor. I mostly pasted in corrections.
    They operated on a shoestring and we hated to send out for corrections, so I spent
    a lot of time cutting out words, rearranging them, and rejustifying lines by hand.
    I also got good at making n&#39;s out of h&#39;s, or h&#39;s out of n&#39;s and
    l&#39;s -- that sort of thing. <BR> <BR>I was an X-acto man, myself. Still am.
    And James, I used to stash mine behind my ear while I was working -- hey, what
    can I say? I was young, brash, and reckless. <BR> <BR>I still have my handy pica
    pole over on my cutting board and I still enjoy using my 00 rapidograph. <BR>
    <BR>I do miss those days, sometimes. But I don&#39;t miss spec&#39;ing type and
    casting off with c/p tables and a calculator. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    <BR>How many times have I torn my hair out trying to make a computer do what I
    could have done with a typositor and an Xacto knife in no time at all? <BR> <BR>How
    many times have I screamed in agony when trying to force a Scitex to do a trap
    I could have done with a sharp knife and one hand tied behind my back? <BR> <BR>I
    passed this article around to the print production team at work today and nearly
    everyone over 40 stopped by to regale me with their own memories -- Bestine fires,
    waxer jams, processor eruptions. <BR> <BR>That article reminded me of that movie
    made when The New York Times switched from hot metal to cold type: &#34;Etaoin
    Shrdlu&#34; by Dave W-somebody? I gotta get me a copy of that one of these days.
    <BR> <BR>Sigh. Yup. I&#39;m old. <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    HS and we used a process camera to photograph laser prints so we could image plates...that&#39;s
    as close as I&#39;ve gotten to old school graphics. <BR> <BR>Everything else has
    been directly on computer. <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t be a graphic artist if it weren&#39;t
    for computer.  I found out when doing rubylith, I don&#39;t have the patience
    nor the ability to do it correctly.  Pasteups, mechanicals, all that &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;...I&#39;d
    ruin them and be fired. <BR> <BR>Yay computer! <BR> <BR>/me sacrifices a virgin
    in the memory of ENIAC.

  body: 'I spent the first ten years or so of my career in the paste up era. One of
    my early jobs was doing paste-up &#40;also known in the midwest at the time as
    keylining&#41; at a weekly newspaper in Minneapolis. Even later as an art director
    I did it quite a bit, but often worked with someone else who did most of it.  <BR>
    <BR>Even though I was pretty good at it, I don&#39;t miss it at all. I would never
    go back. Think about it: You were mainly trying to get things to be straight and
    square. With computers, it requires a deliberate, conscious decision to make things
    crooked. Straight and square is automatic. Overnight, T-squares and triangles
    became obsolete. Good riddance.'

    have memories of hanging around at my stepdad&#39;s newspaper when I was 8, 9
    years old and helping around with the IBM composer and making headlines with letraset
    sheets. I still have an Olfa knife from back in the day. <BR> <BR>Never used a
    waxer though.

  body: I too remember using a waxer and rubber cement to affix galleys of type to
    boards, cutting Amberlith overlays, litho tape, and using Rapidograph pens to
    ink on Mylar. Stat cameras were also a big part of production, and you had to
    be aware of the reduction in line weight as you reduced an image. Don

  body: Ah, the good old days, the depilatory effects of waxing machines, minor operations
    carried out with scalpels, making scalpel &#34;blades&#34; out of tracing paper
    and tossing them to colleagues, studio juniors being sent for a long weight while
    the experienced types carried out their black arts. You never forget the first
    time a scalpel slid off the drawing board and landed in your thigh. But the old
    timers would tell you how easy you had it compared to the molten metal splashes
    from Ludlow machines. So much physical pain was replaced by crashing computers
    and waiting half an hour for a colour laser print only to discover that it had
    pixellated the type. Still like to get the scalpel and the rotring pen out though.

  body: I still have my last blue pen of the paste-up era. Ah, the memories! <BR>
    <BR>At my college newspaper we were in a weird place where production was still
    done with hot wax, but we had Quark 3 or something that the stories were laid
    out on. Then they were printed on 11x17 and pasted to layout sheets and couriered
    to the printer every night.

    it &#34;Industrial Arts&#34;. We used photoplates, an ancient 2 color offeset
    press, lots of Ruby, and screen printing for t-shirts. They had 3 old macs &#40;no
    idea what kind&#41; that we&#39;d play on, and mess around in Photoshop. Our teacher
    was an interesting mix of shop foreman and Mac zealot. His name was Mr. Moxie,
    if I remember correctly. Guess that fit pretty well. <BR> <BR>But once I put my
    hands on a G3 in college, there was no going back. All of my professional work
    had passed through the computer.

    letterpress printing, mechanical drawing and wood shop to eighth grade students.
    <BR> <BR>I wonder what &#34;Interesting mix&#34; of personalities I was to them.
