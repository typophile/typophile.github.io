  \"self-square\" develops an interaction with the user. It is just a simple grid
  (2x2 + diagonals) according to which the user draws freely each characters and define
  its weight by the choice of his tool (pen, marker, etc). The \"self-square\" could
  be printed on a tape, and then, the width of the tape determines the basic leading.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/selfsquare02_4391.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here, you can see that's too easy to get a condensed version."

  body: "This is beautiful. You seem to have bypassed the common problem with any
    type grid systems; allowing people to fill in the lines themselves usually results
    in ugly. Your system seems so simple that I can't imagine anyone being able to
    wreck it.\r\n\r\nI love the stepped B you've drawn, as well as the narrow W."
