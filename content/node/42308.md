  body: "I love the Q, and the G is quite nice too. The J stands out from the other
    letters as being too narrow; either make it as wide as the rest, or experiment
    with making several of the other letters as narrow as the J (like the L, Y, P,
    and S, maybe).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yep, I would echo those thoughts. \r\nThe J is definitely narrow, the corners
    of the V and Z feel unnecessarily pointy and for me the E, F & L seem a bit wide.\r\nIt
    will be interesting to see how things progress!"

  body: the Y has a disorienting angle to it, that could be interpreted as quirky
    / bad depending on your viewer. for me it's the former.

  body: "Although the Q is a nice idea, I don't see it as functional.  I think readers
    may miss the non-slashing slash. \r\n\r\nmgk"

  body: I like the solution for the Q, I agree changes need to be made on the J though.
