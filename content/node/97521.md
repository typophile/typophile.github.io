body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI've recently done a broadcast styling that uses a simple coloured
  block behind the tv program titles. I've converted the used font glyphs to rectangles
  so it can be used as an extra text layer (with the same text entered, just in another
  color) behind the 'real' title, that way it's foolproof for the broadcast mechanics
  :)\r\n\r\nNow onto my problem.. When we use the font in After effects all rectangle
  blocks show up except the one that's supposed to replace the space, it remains a
  regular space. The spaces however work fine and show up as the rectangle blocks
  in non-motion programs like PS or ILL.\r\n\r\nAny idea why this is happening or
  how to solve it? \r\n\r\nthanks a lot in advance! "

    like AE isn't accepting a graphic on the 'space' glyph for some reason.\r\n\r\nYou
    would have the same issue when using this font: \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coniglio/carbon14/\r\n\r\nIt
    has a graphic when typing a space as well.\r\n"

  body: In InDesign, the underline can double as a background. I don't know if AE
    lets you set its size, offset and colour.

    so, what\u2019s the problem? Do you want the spaces to appear as blocks in your
    final product, or are you simply being anal-retentive for no good reason?"

  body: The space character is not like other characters in fonts. It's a special
    case in that its width is potentially variable (as in fully justified text). You
    can put a path in it, but it won't necessarily display an image when it is used.
    In many apps, only the advance width of the space character is used. In those
    cases, there is no workaround except to use a different character in place of
    the space.

  body: "Thanks guys for the answer, especially Mark, that was exactly the explanation
    i was looking for.\r\n\r\n@oldnick\r\nWhy so negative? :) Of course we want the
    spaces to appear as blocks in the final product.  Since broadcast mechanics are
    a bit lazy and want to automate everything, we need to supply a foolproof way
    for them to use on daily basis whilst following the style guide.  \r\n\r\nNot
    supplying this solution would mean a lot more masking etc.. Nothing 'anal-retentive'
    about that."
