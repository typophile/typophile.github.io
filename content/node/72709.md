    there is more than one font used on the linked image, <em>please</em> let us know
    which wording you are trying to have identified. I can't tell you how many times
    I have chased down the wrong font, because the request was not specific about
    which font was in question.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI work for Skanska and can confirm that it is a custom font.
    It's a proprietary font we use for our materials.\r\n\r\nThe logotype isn't so
    much a font as a graphic. We don't ever use it as a typeface.\r\n\r\nI hope this
    helps. I can try to answer any other questions, though I will warn you I may not
    have all the answers.\r\n\r\nJay "

    who knows, so we can close the book on the question. Do they have a name for the
    custom font?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
