body: "I am (G-Type designer Nick Cooke) delighted to announce the release of two
  new OpenType families: Organon Sans and Organon Serif in six weights from Light
  to UltraBlack. These new characterful typefaces have been thoughtfully designed
  for excellent legibility when used in text sizes. Tapered stems give a distinctive
  robust quality which is also suitable for display. Using Organon Sans in conjunction
  with the accompanying serif family makes it ideal for any project requiring elegantly
  sophisticated typography over a range of applications.\r\nAn extensive character
  set has Language coverage for Western, CE, Turkish and Baltic.\r\n\r\nSerif OpenType
  features include:\r\nProportional and Tabular numbers, Lining and Old-style numbers,
  Small Caps, Ligatures and Discretionary Ligatures, Swash small caps and Caps: Q
  and R, q and r.\r\n\r\nSans OpenType features include:\r\nProportional and Tabular
  numbers, Lining and Old-style numbers, Small Caps, Ligatures and Discretionary Ligatures,
  \r\n3 style sets: \r\n1-alternate infant \u2018a\u2019.\r\n2-alternate double-decker
  \u2018g\u2019\r\n3-alternate \u2018y\u2019\r\n\r\nInitially available through Fontworks
  UK.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Osample_5984.gif]\r\n\r\n"

    are there no italics? Or did I miss something?\r\n\r\nRahim"

  body: "Bert - The Organon is the name given by Aristotle\u2019s followers, the Peripatetics
    to the standard collection of his six works on logic. A fair amount of logic coupled
    with creativity goes into the creation of a typeface. And of course those six
    works of logic by Aristotle are essential reading - they\u2019re on my bedside
    table right now.\r\n\r\nBut really I got the name from the first line of \u201CCloudbusting\u201D
    by Kate Bush. Though naming a typeface after a machine that makes rain is not
    such a good idea - that's the last thing we need here in the UK, we've had more
    than enough already (again).\r\n\r\nMichael - Thanks a lot, and congratulations
    to you too for Peanut.\r\n\r\nJan, I'm glad you said that as it means the fonts
    look anonymous enough for text setting, but the subtleties of the designs reveal
    themselves when used for display.\r\n\r\nRahim - no italics yet, maybe after I've
    done converting some of my older stuff to OT.\r\n\r\nBTW - I mentioned the Sans
    style sets but neglected to show them in the sample - here's an update:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Osan_5964.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "The \"Organon\" of Kate Bush' lovely \"Cloudbusting\" is an admitted misspelling.
    Wilhelm Reich's Maine residence was named after his (probably) pseudo-scientific
    theory of orgones, a universal bioenergetic energy form present in the entire
    biosphere, named after the orgasm. I'm not sure about the oregano, though. \r\n\r\nDelicious
    typefaces! Definitely on my wish list."

    the name of that medical term really considered dirty in any part of the world
    in 2009? I'm shocked.

    accumulators that were said to have harnassed orgone - that sounds pretty much
