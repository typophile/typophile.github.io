    I don't know if your sample has some modified letters, or if 'Alexis' only resembles
    the 'real' font, but it could give you something to work with, if no one comes
    up with a better match.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "A little further down the list is another Iconian Font, <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/battlefield.font?nb_ppp=50&text=INDEPTRYSD\">Battlefield</a>,
    which looks like it could be combined with Alexis to get even closer, with less
    work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Looks like it and 'Battlefield' had the same inspiration.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    truth, I only know that Iconian has a number of car brand fonts, so I don't have
    to be <em>that</em> embarrassed. :^P"
