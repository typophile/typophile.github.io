    in order to compare it...\r\n\r\nTry this: select the text with the \"dead\" character
    in it. Copy & paste to Word. It'll probably still show as an empty box there.
    Select that character in Word and press Alt+X, which should show you the Unicode
    number for that character. Go to the [[http://unicode.org/charts/|Unicode charts
    website]] and find the chart that covers this script: that should tell you which
    character you're missing.\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver

    I don\u2019t use Word I did a quick test with Apple\u2019s TextEdit. There appeared
    something like a hidden combining acute, the application doesn\u2019t reveal anything
    about codepoints. Maybe an apostrophe could be meant? At the end, a possible wrong
    text encoding? Pure guess \u2026 And yes, the ??????s are strange as well.\r\nI
    wonder about this because my default font is most comprehensively equipped, even
    in the Cyrillic additions."
