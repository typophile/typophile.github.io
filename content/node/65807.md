body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI just got a new Macbook Pro and (finally) upgraded to
  Adobe CS4. I'm happy I got some better fonts for my collection, but was looking
  at the Adobe Font Folio 11 collection. \r\n\r\nJust a couple of questions: \r\n\r\nDo
  you think it is a wise purchase or are there better collections for the money out
  there? \r\nIf it isn't worth the money, can you suggest another bulk font package
  to purchase?\r\nWhat are your thoughts about the collection in general?\r\n\r\nI've
  had 3 jobs in my career and all have had font collections on the servers to pull
  from. Doing more freelance work these days requires more fonts and I absolutely
  hate stealing so I would like to purchase some of my own. Many thanks for everyone's
  thoughts!\r\n\r\nHappy new year!"

    money, but at least they'll all be hand-picked fresh goods.\r\n\r\nFrom Adobe
    you should nonetheless consider Kinesis, Warnock, Penumbra and a number of other
    gems.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Crunch the numbers. If the clients you have require you to license enough
    fonts that are in the FontFolio that it would cost more to license the fonts than
    to just buy FontFolio, buy FontFolio.

  body: "Agreed Hrant - there's some wonderful work in the Adobe portfolio.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    sometimes I believe that optical kerning (which I like) was implemented because
    of the lousy kerning (or lack of) in a lot of their catalogue. Especially the
    \"STDs\".\r\n\r\nMake sure you use protection and take your time feldhouse as
    you're building your font library. :)\r\n\r\nWhy don't you post what you are looking
    for (body text, etc) and I'm sure you will get some suggestions.\r\n\r\nSeriously
    James unless you're a service bureau or agency I can't imagine the numbers crunching.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Thanks guys for the responses. \r\n\r\nI was just looking for a nice collection
    of display text, unique variations on classics and just a mix of stuff. I guess
    I was just thinking about having a good base to start from beyond what I have
    already. I'm all about some HFJ and TypeTrust these days so I have a good bit
    of fonts from there (Whitney, Gotham, Requiem [one of my favs], Reservation Wide,
    etc.). \r\n\r\nI'll just continue to look for fonts at different foundries and
    select the few I enjoy. I think that will better serve me in the end as well.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks for the replies again as I think it pretty much solidified my suspicions
    on the whole \"buy in bulk\" idea.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJF"

  body: "Just to give a different view: Font folio costs $2600 in the US. The average
    price for a four-font family from Adobe is $120 or so. So you will have to decide
    if there are 25 or so families in the folio that are ones you would want/need.
    If there are, then the folio is a good choice, since you will get all those other
    fonts as well. \r\n\r\nI agree that many of the fonts in the collection are weird,
    but every once in a while you come across a need for weird fonts, and having the
    collection makes for a nice set.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of having the folio is that
    you probably won't be continually buying basic fonts through the year, and you
    can use your font budget to buy some non-Adobe faces, including the ones from
    designers in this forum."

  body: "I think the benefit of purchasing the folio is that you get a collection
    of very complete, classic typefaces. There are a pile of strange, seemingly useless
    typefaces in the collection, but as Don said, sometimes they come in handy. More
    importantly, and maybe this is just me, but I like having some very complete typefaces,
    like Minion or Arno, at my fingertips. If I have a deeply typographic project
    to set, I can use one or two typefaces and create consistent, elegant, well composed
    pages while easily differentiating types of information. From this perspective,
    a half-dozen complete typefaces would easily justify the expense of the entire
    package. If you wanted complete (or even almost complete) versions of typefaces
    like Minion, Arno, Warnock, Kepler, Garamond, Caslon, Helvetica, and Univers,
    (just for example) you might as well purchase the whole package.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it's good to have some \"classics\" because inevitably a client will ask you to
    create a piece consistent with their other materials. You may not fancy Helvetica,
    but you're probably going to end up needing it at some point. My perspective is
    that there are enough complete classics in Fontfolio to justify this as an investment
    in your career. One or two projects will justify the cost and you can use them
    forever, or until open type is replaced by something else."

  body: "I once considered to buy FontFolio, because there is certainly a lot of good
    stuff in there, but it's quite an upront investment, and probably you will use
    a couple of these fonts most of the time, cause they suit your style and clients,
    some display fonts will be used sporadically, and the rest probably never. So
    I decided against it, have bought CorelDraw for the fonts (which is quite a lot
    cheaper and gives you a broad selection of classics) and for the rest bought fonts
    seperately, via MyFonts or directly from some foundry. And I always check the
    deals out at myfonts, as sometimes they have some nice families at deep discounts
    or introduction pricing, so you might land a good deal there. As for the argument
    that a client might come and ask for Univers or something because of brand guidelines,
    I guess it all depends on the kind of work you do, but would not buy FF just in
    case.\r\n\r\nYou might consider buying one of the packages from [[http://www.stormtype.com/packages.html|Storm]],
    which have quite good pricing, and certainly original fonts, so that might be
    an option as well."
