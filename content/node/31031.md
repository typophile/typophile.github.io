  body: Well, for starters one is indeed a sans but the other is a slab serif. This
    smells of either The Font Bureau, Inc. or Hoefler & Frere-Jones, so it might be
    custom type.

  body: Could very well be -- check the top section of the Hoefler & Frere-Jones <a

  body: It also looks a lot like the work of Christian Schwartz. It reminds me of
    his work for <a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/popular.shtml">Popular
    Mechanics</a>.

  body: "Yeah, I agree with Addison. Well, both of you actually. \r\n\r\nIt has the
    same feel as Popular. Sort of a more 'friendly' slap serif than e.g. Lubalin or
    Rockwell. I think the sans and the slab are in the same family, but it must be
    hard for you to tell, when you only have the covers."

  body: It isn't <a href="http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php">Freight
    Sans</a>, but it bears some resemblance. This could also be from [[Joshua Darden]].

  body: "The sans also has a resemblance to Peter Bil'ak's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/fedra-sans/\">Fedra
    Sans</a>, which has a 2-storey g in the expert set. The similar  'a' is what started
    me looking there. I am suggesting this as an alternative to the custom font that
    seems to be the consensus for the ID.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
