    there exist three other fixational movements: micro-saccades, drift, and tremor.
    I would assume they are all inter-related and have some relevance to the process

      talking about the usefulness of tracing text.\r\n\r\nAnother example: Subtitles,
      especially for lyrics, are often outlined and have a fill that sweeps through
      as the words progress. This sweeping movement is almost invariably smooth and
      steady, at least within a given word. This would work if we swept our eyes smoothly
      across each word before moving to the next one, but in reality it just makes
      them hard to follow. Much more effective are the ones that simply fill an entire
      word or syllable all at once. An interesting idea would be to fill the bouma-shapes
      separately where they may be smaller than words and may not correspond exactly
      to syllables.\r\n\r\nEdit: of course, this may aid fast reading, but it might
      be awkward if you're trying to sing along."

    details that can sometimes be important.>\r\n\r\nI find this a fascinating concept
    -- especially in relation to writing and poetry. (Reading back I see that I've
    managed to ramble on about it, too...)\r\n\r\nOur brains do this all the time
    -- It is apparent in proofreading how quickly our brains fix typos so we don't
    notice them, which is great if the goal is to understand the message, but not
    so much when you want to catch the errors... \r\n\r\nPatterns -- think houndstooth
    and how that can look uniformly gray -- or the thread a while back about \"uniform
    colour\" and Hrant's position on the necessity of contrast.\r\n\r\nObject perception
    -- we see a dog with specific physical qualities, but we recognize it as \"dog\"
    by removing/ignoring the extra detail and fitting it to our generic concept of
    dog. Or, to relate this to type, we recognize a lowercase letter a regardless
    of its typeface, based on certain attributes that have nothing to do with the
    detail of the particular typeface. Yet it is precisely the unnoticed details which
    make a typeface readable (or not). I would venture that if the average reader
    spends too much time focusing on the details of the type, it isn't doing a very
    good job of being type. \r\n\r\nI'd also apply it to the way we understand and
    process other kinds of information, not just visual details. We make stories our
    own by filling in the gaps with our own detail as well as by \"smoothing out\"
    the details into something which resembles ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe devil *is* in
    the detail. You can get bogged down in it, lose all perspective, and become entirely
    unable to function, but it also makes things work and gives a breath of life to
    what we do. The average person is intent on the message, not the detail -- the
    writers, editors and type designers take care of the detail so the layman doesn't
    have to know or care about saccades.\r\n\r\nKristina"

    is fixation points are not highly predictable,\r\nand bouma choices even less
    so (since it depends on so many\r\nthings, like reader experience for one). So
    simply going for\r\nword-at-a-time* is probably best (especially since that sort\r\nof
