body: I have client who has been using Magistral ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/magistral/
  ) for most of their materials. I want to improve on the typeface, so looking around
  I found Neosans/Neotech ( http://www.monotypefonts.com/WhatsNew/Releases.asp?show=neo
  ) which I love but the price doesn't love me so does anyone know of any other typefaces
  similar to Neosans that are more affordable

    font is likely not as well-made as an expensive one. (This is not a hard and fast
    rule, but it tends to be true most of the time.)\r\n\r\nIf you only purchase the
    weights you need, Neo might be exactly what you're craving.\r\n\r\nAnyhow... I'm
    sure that someone who is better-acquainted with all of the new releases from all
    foundries will be along in a short while to provide some alternatives for you."

    do you need? It's possible to buy <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.117386.0.0\">singles</a>.
    (Though the package is always a better overall value.)"

    Fonts.com: the latter site is a... challenge to navigate.'

  body: "I have to say that at $42 per single font ($49 in OpenType format), or $450
    for a pack of 14, Neo Sans/Tech certainly has premium pricing.\r\n\r\nMind you,
    premium pricing of key new releases seems to work well for Monotype and Linotype,
    so I'm not going to knock it. (Note: NOT trying to start a discussion of how everybody
    should price their fonts, as that gets into anti-trust territory.)\r\n\r\nT"
