body: "I just finished a four-page magazine spread and am trying to figure out a way
  to shoot it for my 11x17 landscape portfolio. it's entirely type-based and probably
  needs a close-up to go with it. \r\n\r\nI've been looking around for inspiration
  on how others have solved this but haven't found a solution that really works for
  me. if you happen to have pics, would you mind sharing? I'd love to see how others
  have shot wide non-poster spreads.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\nno really - thanks."
