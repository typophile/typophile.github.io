  like weeks now. Oppressive humidity has blanketed the air with a thickness that
  thwarts all efforts to be a productive member of society. And the extended forecast
  doesn\u2019t indicate it is going to end anytime soon.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/weather_3950.png]\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s
  long-awaited announcement of [[http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/|Hoefler
  & Frere-Jones\u2019 Cloud.typography]] came as a welcomed procrasti-distraction
  from the constant hum of desk fans, window ACs and cranky, bored offspring. \r\n\r\n\r\nSince
  plenty will be written by more [[http://typographica.org/on-typography/my-favorite-font-sources-a-shortlist-of-trusted-foundries-and-retailers/|credible
  folk]] about H&FJ\u2019s jaw-droppingly impressive webfonts, let\u2019s talk about
  other sorts of Cloud Typography, during this week of cumulous typographic activity.
  \r\n\r\nThe Cloud Appreciation Society boasts, well, an unabashed love of clouds.
  Member Dani\xE8le Siebenhaar offers an ambitious collection of [[http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/letters-in-the-sky/|clouds
  that look like letterforms]], amongst other recognizable shapes (a sleeping baby,
  for example). \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-z_of_clouds_6246.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  digging the F and the Z but that R is a bit suspect.\r\n\r\nI bet you were just
  thinking to yourself, \u201CGee, I wonder if there are some awesome examples of
  ASCII art clouds?\u201D [[http://ascii.co.uk/art/clouds|Look no more]]. \r\n\r\nThis
  is exactly what yesterday\u2019s thunderstorm looked like. EXACTLY. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asciicloud_6010.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.retrojunkie.com/asciiart/nature/clouds.htm|ASCII
  Art\u2014Nature\u2014Clouds]].\r\n\r\nUnicode character for \u2018cloud\u2019? U+2601.
  \u2601\r\n\r\nUgly typography word clouds? [[http://www.google.com/search?q=typographic+cloud&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=ZkfSUeqFO6nx0wGsjoG4Cw&ved=0CDgQsAQ&biw=1292&bih=779|There\u2019s
  plenty of those]].\r\n\r\nScott McCloud\u2019s comic fonts? [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/scott-mccloud/|Sure]].
  \r\n\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raXanYjTF18|Bob Ross painting happy clouds]]?
  \r\n\r\nOk, a little off topic there.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, H&FJ is clearly going
  to encounter an uphill battle seizing that coveted number one spot in a Google search
  of \u201Ccloud typography\u201D. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/googlesearchcloud_5006.png]\r\n\r\nNevermind."
