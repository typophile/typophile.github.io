  body: it looks nice in most areas.  some problems for me are in the sharp corners
    found in the N, and the very awkward tail of the j/J.  the tail of the y is much
    better resolved.  also, i think the capitals R and P are a little weak, maybe
    making them wider will help.  in the lowercase alphabet, the a seems most out
    of place and unfitting.

  body: Very friendly looking. I&#39;d enjoy seeing a few sample headlines set in
    mixed case. My eyes are stopping particularly on the cap S and Z - which seem
    heavier than the rest of the uppercase. I like the quirkiness of the stroke junction
    I the X/x, and wonder if this could be applied elsewhere in the font - perhaps
    R or K? The little beard serif on the cap G made me smile.

  body: 'Brad: It would be interesting to see a text set. Can you post? <BR> <BR>My
    initial thought is that the J/j combo is not working as Loren mentioned. The lowercase
    a stands out to me as well.  The squared edge seems to work better on the e. I
    do like the beard on the G...although I&#39;m not fond of it on the s. Perhaps
    it would look better on the lowercase u &#40;like the cap&#41;?  <BR> <BR>I look
    forward to seeing more!'

  body: Here are some revistions to the typeface. I changed the lowercase a, Fixed
    the J/j pair, Rounded the N, Thined down the Z, anded the beadrd to the u, and
    made the P &amp; R wider. Please let me know what you think, and thank you for
    all your input. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Brad <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13625.gif"

  body: I also added the Xx intersection the the Kk, and am wondering on your thoughts
    on these different a&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: 'Hi Brad, <BR> <BR>Much improved. A couple of observations: <BR> <BR>-- The
    top cross bars on the E and F seem droopy and tired. Perhaps handle it like the
    letter T? &#40;With the T: the horizontal stroke seems heavier than the vertical
    stroke.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- The J&#39;s are improved, but could still be shortened
    a tad. <BR> <BR>-- How would it look if the leg of the R dipped below the baseline?
    <BR> <BR>-- I can see you are struggling with the lowercase a. What if you simply
    mimicked the bowl of the d? &#40;See my horribly rendered version below...you
    get the idea.&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, keep massaging it and it will start to shine!!

  body: Good call on the R. I tried bringing it under the baseline. I like it a bunch.
    I also like you idea for the a. I think it need a bit of polishing, but I think
    both ideas helped a bunch... I also tried the E &amp; F. I think I like it more,
    but I have to sleep on it to be sure. <BR> <BR>Thanks Again <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13649.gif"
