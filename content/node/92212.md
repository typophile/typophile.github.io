  typefaces which contain glyphs that are complete words - like \"THE\" or \"AND\".\r\nIt's
  hard to search for these because I don't know the term. And searching for \"and
  glyph\" really ain't working. \r\n"

  body: "Word logos/word logotypes.\r\n\r\n\u201CWord\u201D is somewhat redundant,
    as <em>\u03BB\u03BF\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2</em> means word. However, Linotype manufactured
    what it termed \u201Clogotypes\u201D for its system in the early 20th century,
    and these were \u201Cpre-kerned\u201D two-letter glyph combinations of Ta, Wo,
    etc. Therefore, to distinguish from these, it is probably best to add the word
    \u201Cword\u201D, as John Downer does in describing the logotypes he made for
    Brothers.\r\n\r\nWhether this terminology is widespread, or re\uFB02ected in keywords,
    is another matter.\r\n"

  body: "The way somebody like Downer would use it, it would be \"catchword\"* (from
    signpainting). But in terms of typography \"logotype\" is indeed the common term
    (and as Nick says it could be as short as two letters).\r\n\r\n* Related: http://fontsinuse.com/the-chop-shop/\r\n\r\nThere
    was even once a patent involving an expanded typecase (I mean for hand-setting)
    where in addition to individual letters there were a large number of frequently-occurring
    letter sequences. The point was to save not only time but money, since typesetters
    would charge by the sort. :-)  But then the typesetters switched to charging by
    the letter...\r\n\r\nI featured much of this in one of my Thessaloniki talks -
    I'll try to dig up some visuals.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    * *\r\n\r\nA lot of people don't seem to know the uses of the word \"logotype.\"
    I used that word to refer to the two-character pairs available in some Linotype
    fonts (Va, Ve, Vo, Vu, Ta, Te, To, Tu, Fa, etc.) & got a ??? from an \"expert
    reader.\" "

    \" is that it is also (probably more prominently) used to describe when the first
    word of the following page is also placed at the bottom of the current one. \r\n\r\nOf
    course, \"logotype\" also has the meaning of \"wordmark,\" so it's not \"clean\"
    either..."

    the French called it \"poly[ma]typie\". And I remember now that \"logography\"
    was another term for the method of using multi-letter sorts. No matter what you
    call it it's pretty impressive (if actually to me not surprising) that a typesetter
    could handle this many types of sorts, at speed.\r\n\r\nBTW, to add to the confusion:
    logograph/logogram and ideograph/ideograph are often used to speak about Chinese...\r\n\r\n>
