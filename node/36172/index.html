<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Shortly after the death of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, presumably by the end of the year of 1930, the American publishing house Doubleday & Company brought out the 1122-page complete edition "The Complete Sherlock Holmes" with a preface by Christopher Morley. There have been innumerable stereotyped (or perhaps electrotyped) reprinted by Doubleday, and much later innumerable offset reprints based on the very same text which was typeset in the early 1930s.
When the Sherlock Holmes works entered public domain fifty years later, the British publishing house Penguin Books started in 1981 to publish paperback offset reprints of the 1122-page Doubleday hardcover edition. I have both editions - hardcover by Doubleday and softcover by Penguin -, but both editions, due to the innumerable reprints, the text is so very much "blurred" (or "mackled", as printers say) that it turned out to be a difficult "Holmes case" to identify the typeface used in the early 1930s for typesetting this famous Sherlock Holmes edition.
(Note: The entire text of this Doubleday edition, using the very same page numbers, is also available here for download in electronic form: http://camdenhouse.ignisart.com/canon/index.html)
I uploaded two sample pages from the printed Doubleday edition
http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes1.gif (title page)
http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes2.gif (preface)
Although I scanned these sample pages with extremely high resolution, it was by no means easy to find out the name of the typeface used for typesetting this famous Sherlock Holmes edition.

Your sample is awfully large and the resolution is a mess, so it's hard to tell.</div>

It's not the resolution, it's the quality of the reprint.
However, I added a color scan, perhaps it is better:

This is very very excellent indeed.
I uploaded a letterpress Electra specimen from 1950 as this scan:
http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes4.jpg
However, there is a big riddle to be solved by some sleuth such as Sherlock Holmes. As I said and as is proved, the 1122-page Doubleday edition, a copy of which is available in the Library of Congress, was published in 1930:
http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes5.jpg
And now the big riddle: The Electra typeface by Dwiggins is said to have been designed after 1930, namely 5 years later in 1935. How is is possible that Doubleday used a font in 1930, which did not exist in 1930? This is a big riddle which can only be solved, if a typographical sleuth can prove that Dwiggins designed Electra at least in 1930, i.e. at least 5 years earlier than the year given by most typeface historians in various typography books and also by Linotype in its most recent catalogs.
I should add that designing (on paper) was not enough. For typesetting the huge 1122-page complete edition, the matrices or punches had to finished too in the year 1930.

<div class=commentbody>I just checked the big colour scan and I can confirm this is Electra, which makes this whole identification an honest-to-God X-files case. What happened in those lost five years? :^/</div>
