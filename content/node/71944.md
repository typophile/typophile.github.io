  various chinese fonts, they look ok in linotype font explorer, but when I try to
  type with them or paste a text some squares appear instead of the actual glyph.\r\n\r\nI've
  never worked with this language before so feel free to lecture me.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"

  body: "I think the problem is the font family does not match the character encoding.\r\nPlease
    make sure you use the same encoding, traditional Chinese characters as traditional
    chinese font family, or simplified characters as simplified font family.\r\n\r\nFor
    ex, DFP Hei\u2122 Simplified Chinese Font Family or DF Hei Traditional Chinese
    Font Family.\r\nAnd also use Google to translate texts between Traditional and
    Simplified.\r\n\r\nps, traditional characters is used in Taiwan and Hong Kong,
    simplified characters used in China."
