Type lives, it just goes on unappreciated. We live in a time when type enjoys the greatest availability, the greatest amount of choice, the most functionality, and by far the cheapest prices in history. Type isn't even a carcinogenic and doesn't cause global warming.

Of the two type-only covers, one has the absolute most incorrect font choice. I guess style generally overpowers content (in magazines).

<div class=commentbody>ITC was formed in 1970. Why would a Czech font be more appropriate? And what does ITC have to do with anything anyway?
For what it's worth, the cover line was a quote taken from a lengthy article in that issue that followed an infantry unit from basic training to active combat in Vietnam. The war was in its early stages at the time and the idea that U.S. soldiers were killing little girls was pretty shocking to Americans at the time. This was two years before My Lai. (Source: The Art of Advertising, George Lois on Mass Communication, 1977.)
It doesn't say in the book I got this info from why Lois chose Bodoni. I suspect that he wanted something that looked sober and factual, and perhaps a face that looked like what the articles were set in. (They usually used Franklin Gothic on the cover.)
By the way, the three Esquire covers that made the top ten were all designed by George Lois. He practically set the standard of what a good magazine cover is.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the old Czech style has a raw, fauve feel that suits war, and this type of thing in particular, much better.
Sorry about not know the ITC timeline. But my connection was simply that they had access to Czech faces, so it's not like a US designer couldn't get any. Maybe it was different in 1966, but still: Bodoni?! Even just Franklin Gothic itself would have been much better.
> the idea that U.S. soldiers were killing little

And Bodoni hasn't been "shocking" for centuries.
> It doesn’t say in the book I got this info from why Lois chose Bodoni.
Probably the same reason most people choose Bodoni.

Oh, I doubt that. Lois was a stickler for typography. It may be that Bodoni doesn't have the same connotations now as it did then. Tastes change. Mostly, I think you just don't like Bodoni. :-)</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>1966 was a very different time, not only in typography and magazine design, but in life in the U.S. This was the first time in American history that major media were asking very tough questions of our government. As Mark indicates, this was a shock to America. We were killing babies. I graduated from college in 1966 and was soon after "absorbed" into the military. The following year, I was sent to Viet Nam. I was stationed a few mile from My Lai when the massacre happened and heard about it from some nearby soldiers. I was there for the Tet offensive of 1968 and sent home the day Martin Luther King was shot. The world had changed greatly in 2 years. I was called a baby killer and spat upon after arriving back in the States. This never would have happened 2 years earlier.
Sorry, back to type.
Lois probably chose a "normal" type to contrast this most "un-normal" act. It looked like a normal quote pulled from a magazine and just ripped your guts out for that reason. The land of Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and Lassie were jolted out of their Hollywood dream by the stark, naked, unembellished truth of war.
Sorry again, back to type.
Type was not an "instant gratification sport" like it is today. You had limited choices for tight deadlines like a weekly news magazine. Mostly, like I said before, it wasn't about the typeface. Things are not always about type. I wish they were, that would be much simpler a world. Children don't die because of a typeface.
Sorry again. I can't get back to type just now.

<div class=commentbody>Op/Ed piece <a href=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/358212p-305251c.html>here</a> got me thinking.
In the coming months we'll probably see one or more typographic, or at least typonumeric, US magazine covers when the 2000th US soldier dies in Iraq. I'm guessing '2000' white on black. Which font* would you use?

Sticking with the rules the type would be reversed out of the black oil - that might look good. But that might confuse the readers as oil might equate more to gas prices than the casualties of war.

You could "angularize" two opposing corners in the counter of the zero*. And I would use an extended weight (at a smaller size as a result) if there is one.
* And then maybe the same for the top-right of the top counter of the 2.
About the red though: not solid, but a subtle swirly texture. Like a quagmire.

<div class=commentbody>For the type only cover, I'm reminded of what Bob Gill (Pentagram founder) had to say in his 1970s How-To book on graphic design (titled "Forget everything you know about graphic design"?), which was that the more interesting the copy is, the less creative treatment it needs. I think he gave the example of "Cure for cancer discovered" needing no creative spin. That philosophy was implemented by George Lois.
The layout style Lois used for "Oh my God.." was an ad headline style of the '60s, whereby it looked like it was a text setting, blown up big -- Upper and lower case, flush left. Very informal and conversational, like the ad copy of the time. (However, they did nuance the setting for scale by tightening it up a lot.)
At that time, Bodoni was appreciated as an un-fancy font (and is to this day by Massimo Vignelli et al), due to its rationalized geometric structure. Used real big in headlines, the serifs are like slab serifs, and the few funky idiosyncracies like the kink in the y's tail serve to roughen up the geometric logic of its overall construction, accentuating the "this is a scrap, enlarged" idea.
Carl Ally countered Helmut Krone's "We Try harder" ads for Avis, which had body text set in something like 24 pt Perpetua Bold, with similar "big type' ads for Hertz, set in Bodoni Bold. Although they were working with typositor types, the idea was that those guys were blowing up fine text types to headline size and using them as massive "text" weapons. This effect of typographic scale can be appreciated more when you hold the magazine, rather than see it in a reproduction.
Lois had done type-only headline ads (eg. "John, is Billy Coughing, Get him some medicine," again on a black background), and I don't think he drew a distinction in technique between the ads and editorial. It's all about the Big Idea. His Esquire covers used the same creative vocabulary as his ads. In "My God..", you have a headline and body copy, with an asymmetric use of plenty of "white" space. It is the ruthless minimalism, coupled with an exact positioning and balance of elements, which makes this a masterpiece. And the Big Idea. If Andy Warhol put the language of popular, commercial culture in the art gallery, George Lois put conceptual art on the street.
BTW, Lois had served in the Korean War. </div>

<div class=commentbody><em>It doesn’t say in the book I got this info from why Lois chose Bodoni. I suspect that he wanted something that looked sober and factual, and perhaps a face that looked like what the articles were set in. (They usually used Franklin Gothic on the cover.)
By the way, the three Esquire covers that made the top ten were all designed by George Lois. He practically set the standard of what a good magazine cover is.</em>
FWIW, one of the first jobs the young George Lois had as a CBS staff designer, working under William Golden, was to redesign all the characters of Bodoni – Didot Bodoni as they called it – as the CBS corporate face. And he complained – jokingly – about how demanding Golden was. Bodoni does the job perfectly on the Esquire cover. Lois: big ego, but brilliant indeed.

True. But a more creative treatment can still only help (although by "creative" I certainly don't mean obvious or mannered).
> At that time, Bodoni was appreciated as an un-fancy font
Even assuming we can know that, and it's true, it remains that a font also has an effect on people irrespective of what they <cite>think</cite> it's evoking.
> the kink in the y’s tail
That's actually a text-level effect, [generally] misplaced in the display realm.
