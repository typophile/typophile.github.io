  a critique on this logo for an upcoming play. I don't have a lot of experience creating
  swashes, but I really felt that was the right way to go with this logo, because
  it's a whimsical family-oriented show that will play around the holiday season (though
  there's no holiday element to the show).\r\n\r\nThe first attached image is simply
  the logo above; the second shows the logo in use.\r\n\r\nA note: I'm not interested
  in any critiques on the choice of typeface that I started from (LHF Ross). The show
  itself has a late-19th/early-20th century vibe, so I'm pretty comfortable with the
  type choice there. I would, however, like critique on any or all of the following
  questions:\r\n\r\n1. At first I was going for more circular curves on the large
  outer loops, but they were really too large, so I went for the curves they are now
  to kind of pick up the trapezoidal shape of the logo in general. Are the curves
  too extreme? Also, is it a problem if they're not mirrored exactly left to right?
  (Where the curves originate and end don't match, so it seems impossible for them
  to be mirrors, but I'm wondering if it's a problem to be so similar and yet not
  exact.)\r\n\r\n2. I know there are a couple of problem spots where one of the tails
  loops through and creates the top second A crossbar. If anyone has any comments
  about those spots I'd be happy to hear them. Even better, if you have an idea where
  you think the points should be to create more fluid curves in those spots, I'd love
  it if you'd take the jpg, circle those spots, and reupload it. I've had a devil
  of a time picking where the points should be in that section.\r\n\r\n3. I know it's
  not really an accurate use of a swash, but I love the top R tail's creating the
  end of the L. From a typographer's standpoint, however, is doing that a major crime
  against swashes? Just curious.\r\n\r\n4. The diamonds in the O's: too precious?\r\n\r\n5.
  Anything else?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCheshire"

  body: It's in the typeface that way and is one of the reasons I chose that face.
    There is a more conventional alternate S in the typeface, but I love this one,
    especially because it echoes the unusual acrobatics of the show. I neglected to
    mention the show is an offbeat, wordless physical theatre piece that is inspired
    by vintage circus routines, among other things.

  body: "Hi, Chesh\r\n\r\n- It would be nice if the left large loop and the right
    large loop were exactly the same. They are so close that it is creating tension
    for me.\r\n- I love the detail of the swash crossing into the L. Can this happen
    in other strategic spots? \r\n- The spot where the tails of the RA cross needs
    depth. (see point 2)\r\n- I think the UR and the RA are too loose. And the IO
    is too tight.\r\n- I think the spot where the tail ends up seems anti-climatic.
    \r\n\r\nThese are fiddly suggestions. In general I think it works.\r\n\r\nPs.
    I like the wonky S, it adds character."

    -- those all give me some things to refine. Happy to hear that I'm not as far
    off as I feared."

  body: Oh and I think the right big loop is nicer than the left one because it has
    a little contrast and is more sinuous.

  body: "I totally agree with Miss Tiffany; As far as the mirrored loops on either
    side, I would definitely make sure that the pointy-ness of the right curve at
    the bottom is translated over to the left curve. The left one looks rounder/flatter
    than the right.\r\n\r\nOne other note: The RL Ligature has a nice attribute: the
    swash \"overlaps\" the L and there is a gap. Could you do this elsewhere? I think
    Miss Tiffany suggested the RA cross, or maybe even the A's own crossbar.\r\n\r\nNice
    work.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"
