  Stencil A but not an exact match. Any clue? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/7648.jpg"

  body: It might&#39;ve been taken from a photo of an actual tour crate &#40;the box
    looks like a miniature of a tour crate, doesn&#39;t it?&#41; or heavily manipulated
    in Photoshop or Illustrator &#40;the Ts and Gs are quite different&#41;.

  body: Yes it looks like a picture taken from a tour crate. Usually the text is spray
    painted on with stencils. As for the look of the letters I can take care of that.
    I&#39;m just trying to find the font used. If all else fails I guess I can use
    the MD Military Stencil A and just modify it.

  body: i think what he&#39;s saying is it may not be a font but an actual stencil.
    <BR>sometimes the best way to get that &#34;stencil look&#34; is to actually cut
    out <BR>some letters and do some spray painting. but that&#39;s just me.

    5.000 worth of computer equipment to achieve the exact effect you get with a  couple
    of sheets of paper, a pair of scissors and a spray can. It&#39;s not just you,

  body: The weirdest thing with stencil fonts was that we used an Apply stencil font
    for a book cover raw design and the client liked it so much we HAD to use exactly
    that type design. But to get it more organic we printed out a large version of
    the book title, sprayed it on paper, re-scanned it, put it through streamline
    and THEN used it in the final design. A bit of a weird digital-analog-digital-ride,
    but so much fun we ended up spray-painting the whole concrete floor of our studio
    with senseless messages :-&#41;

  body: It&#39;s reassuring to notice that some people are still willing to get their
    hands dirty to make something beautiful. <BR> <BR>Reminds me of how Ian Swift
    explained at an FSI conference how he made this billboard for Labatt Ice or something
    like that. It was quite exhilarating hearing him go on enthousiastically about
    the making of the piece, feeling the building tension and anticipation in the
    crowd as he explained the various stages of creation which included baking his
    printouts in an oven, putting them in the freezer, smashing them to bits and reassembling
    the pieces etc., and the sudden roar of applause when he finished his story...
    Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll!

    <BR>  <BR>It&#39;s a pretty decent match, though it&#39;s clear that the original
    specimen appears to be hand-done. <BR> <BR>'
