  body: Perhaps the designer used Belwe but redrew the <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Character?id=0057&amp;vid=67607&amp;charset=CP4&amp;charpage="
    TARGET="_top">&#39;W&#39;</A>. A big improvement.

  body: i was a bit thrown off because it was so rounded... but i guess you enlarged
    it from <BR><A HREF="http://www.tacojohns.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.tacojohns.com/</A>
    ? <BR>the E is bit different in the top. weird. <BR>it must be Belwe, and like
    Scoles said, the W is fixed up. and if you look closely at tacojohns.com, the
    white space to the right in the W is too big... which implies that they simply
    removed the little flag thing and put a serif there.
