    Copyright (c) 2011 by Tyler Finck\r\nThis is now part of Google Web Fonts and
    I found it using the 2nd (original) image. \r\nI think it's better to do a first
    search using the original image and if there is no result, you can try other methods
    as to de-italicize it etc.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n\r\n"
