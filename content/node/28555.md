  body: "<a href=http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-OClock-High-Henry-King/dp/B00005PJ8V>Sorry
    - The very nature of the design insprires bad puns.</a>\r\n\r\nNice clock, but
    I agree it is a little busy and a little corny. Not that that is a bad thing,
    depending on the audience. It has sort of a comfortable dated feel - if anyone
    can make sense of that. "

    to display different types in 4 or 5 sizes proportional to the concentric Letter-Wheels?!
    \r\n\r\nIn this alternative, not only numbers but letters are also displayed.\r\nDo
    not forget to exploit the Flower Center. And do not forget me?!\r\n\r\nHappy Making
    and Selling 24-hour Flower-like Type Clock."

  body: "Seems to me that the quadrants for 3 and 9 aren't aligning, I think I would
    prefer the numerals to be the same height, possibly excepting 12, 3, 6 and 9,
    about the height of the 4, have you tried spelling out the numbers in their various
    faces on a curve? What colour are the hands going to be?\r\n\r\nTim\r\nThanks
    for indulging my \"humour\":)"
