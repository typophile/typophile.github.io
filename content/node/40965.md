body: "Having a bit of trouble with alt characters\u2026\_everything works fine in
  the Fontlab OpenType features window using\r\n\r\nfeature aalt {\r\n  sub O by Oalt;\r\n
  \ sub Oacute by Oacutealt;\r\n  sub Ograve by Ogravealt;\r\n  sub Ocircumflex by
  Ocircumflexalt;\r\n  sub Odieresis by Odieresisalt;\r\n  sub Otilde by Otildealt;\r\n
  \ sub Oslash by Oslashalt;\r\n  sub o by oalt;\r\n  sub oacute by oacutealt;\r\n
  \ sub ograve by ogravealt;\r\n  sub ocircumflex by ocircumflexalt;\r\n  sub odieresis
  by odieresisalt;\r\n  sub otilde by otildealt;\r\n  sub oslash by oslashalt;\r\n}
  aalt;\r\n\r\nBut I noticed there's no way to access 'aalt' in Illustrator CS3\u2026
  so I wanted to add salt, ss01 and maybe titl as well in the OT features for multi-application
  access.\r\n\r\nI found this thread containing a suggestion:\r\n\r\nWhenever you
  define any features in your font that produce 1:1 substitutions by some alternates
  (salt, ss01-ss20, swsh, hist, smcp, c2sc etc.), you should link these features to
  aalt in the following way:\r\n\r\nfeature aalt {\L\r\nfeature salt;\L\r\nfeature
  ss01;\L\r\nfeature ss02;\L\r\nfeature hist;\r\n\Lfeature smcp;\L\r\nfeature c2sc;\r\n\L}
  aalt;\r\n\r\nBut not sure how to implement and 'link' these\u2026\_does it go above
  or below the 'aalt' feature code?\r\n\r\nAnd does aalt on it's own just not show
  up in some applications such as Illustrator?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Mike, 'aalt' is (indirectly) accessed via the Glyph Palette.\r\nBut anyway,
    I think this is what you want:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature aalt {\r\nfeature salt;\r\nfeature
    ss01;\r\nfeature titl;\r\n} aalt;\r\n\r\nfeature salt {\r\nlookup OALT {\r\nsub
    O by Oalt;\r\nsub Oacute by Oacutealt;\r\nsub Ograve by Ogravealt;\r\nsub Ocircumflex
    by Ocircumflexalt;\r\nsub Odieresis by Odieresisalt;\r\nsub Otilde by Otildealt;\r\nsub
    Oslash by Oslashalt;\r\nsub o by oalt;\r\nsub oacute by oacutealt;\r\nsub ograve
    by ogravealt;\r\nsub ocircumflex by ocircumflexalt;\r\nsub odieresis by odieresisalt;\r\nsub
    otilde by otildealt;\r\nsub oslash by oslashalt;\r\n}OALT;\r\n} salt;\r\n\r\nfeature
    ss01 {\r\nlookup OALT;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nfeature titl {\r\nlookup OALT;\r\n} titl;</code>\r\n\r\nAnd
    while you're at it, the correct glyph names for your alternates is O.alt , Oacute.alt
    , etc. (notice the dot before 'alt')"

  body: "Okay cool thats working now I thought my output error had to do with the
    above lookup code but it was within a font that I had removed all of the kerning
    data but left the kern feature in\u2026 as soon as I deleted the kern feature
    and compiled all was fine\u2026 happens to be a font that i'm redoing the kerning
    on\u2026 "

    of curiosity does not having the dot before alt compromise anything?\r\n\r\nAppreciate
    your response!\r\n\r\nMike"
