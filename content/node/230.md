body: 'Question -  <BR> <BR>What are appropriate uses for smallcaps, in regards to
  acryonms and initials? I ask because I recently read an article in the May 19th
  New Yorker, &#34;The AIDS Rebel,&#34; which presents a curious mix of tallcaps and
  smallcaps. <BR> <BR>For example: <BR> <BR> &#34;H.I.V.&#34; is in tallcaps, while
  &#34;AIDS&#34; is in smallcaps, &#34;TAC&#34; &#40;an organization name&#41; is
  in smallcaps while &#34;A.N.C.&#34; is in tallcaps, and &#34;A.M.&#34; is in small
  while &#34;AZT&#34; is tall.  <BR> <BR>Topping it off is the combination &#34;H.I.V./AIDS&#34;
  with the &#34;H.I.V.&#34;in tall and the &#34;AIDS&#34; in small ...  <BR> <BR>Enlighten
  me.'

    might be that the editor decided that acronyms that are so commonplace as to be
    a word &#40;such as AIDS, which no one says &#34;A-I-D-S&#34;&#41;, should be
    in small caps, while other acronyms remain in tall caps. '

  body: 'The &#34;A.M.&#34; was in the context of something like &#34;At Ten A.M.
    on Tuesday ...&#34; <BR> <BR>The usage seems to be: with periods, tall, without
    periods, small. <BR> <BR>The upshot is that the reader winds up shouting some
    names in their head and softly emphasizing others. Visually jarring, too, for
    the article is littered with acronyms &#40;two-three per paragraph&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>One more usage - when repeating a t-shirt slogan, the slogan is all smallcaps.
