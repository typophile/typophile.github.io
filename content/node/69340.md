body: I'm currently designing some badge clips for a beer producer and getting ready
  to present visuals. I've created some classic beer badge typography (chiseled shadow
  etc) but want to describe the elements correctly. Can anyone direct me to where
  I might find this info?

  body: I'm not really sure if there is a set vocabulary for this kind of stuff. A
    picture is worth a thousand words, and in this case just giving a visual example
    of what you're trying to explain is probably best.
