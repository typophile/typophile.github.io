  body: ".......hmmmm, actually, Meta has round 'i' dots....but the 'g' is definitely,
    very distinctly Meta.\r\n\r\nThis designer must have wanted the 'i' dots to be
    square so this wordmark would fit against square layouts more neatly, so they
    were customized.\r\n\r\nIf that's the case, one wonders why the top terminations
    of the 't' and 'l' weren't squared off.....and why mixed case was used since the
    'g' descender will also cause layout problems...."
