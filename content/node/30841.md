  body: These marks were  not made from a digital font. It was probably an engraving
    machine or stencil. You can get a similar feeling with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=SG.9416.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=PATEK+PHILIPPE&sampleSize=32">DIN

  body: Wow. I thought my first post was pretty clear. Some letters are not made from
    fonts. You need make these forms yourself, or hire a letterer to do them.

  body: "Dave, you have to realise that this kind of lettering is output device-specific:
    it is a set of characters that is produced specifically for a certain type of
    engraving machine. This means it has no equivalent in what we know as digital
    fonts. <strong>This alphabet only exists for engraving machines to make these
    watches, not as a digital font.</strong> We can't find this font because it simply
    <strong>DOES NOT EXIST</strong>.\r\n\r\nOther examples are alphabets available
    for the stamping machines that produce automobile license plates, for sowing and
    embroidery machines, for stone engraving et al. It just is a different world.
    In some rare cases you\u2019ll find alphabets that have digital font counterparts,
    but more often than not they will be unique to that reproduction system."

    a drill bit that is designed to cut sideways, incising means that without manual
    finishing it is impossible to get a square corner.\r\nThere are some sample fonts
    here, although pretty rough.\r\nhttp://www.able-engravers.com/engraving_fonts.htm\r\n\r\nTim"
