  in the California Flag? Is this even a font that can be bought as an electronic
  file? Gracias for your time.\r\n\r\n"

  body: These letters were probably drawn specifically for the flag. You can get close
    with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/refrigerator/?sample_text=CALIFORNIA%20REPUBLIC&sample_size=36">Refrigerator</a>,
    but you'll need to do that 'R' by hand.
