body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nIn my leisure-time I am working on a Typeface inspired by an
  old lettering from a Portuguese Pharma company.\r\nAfter some search (posts here
  in Typophile) I found some similarities with Hubert Jocham\u2019s Milk. But even
  so I decided to go on.\r\n\r\nI would be thankful if you could take a look at it.\r\n\r\nThere
  are certainly some problems with some glyphs at the moment (for example I dont like
  the S, T, Y) The V, W, X, Y and Z also need more work...\r\n\r\nJust need some feedback
  before I can go further with it...\r\nThanks a lot for your help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amarantino_6434.jpg]"

  body: For me the stumps at the bottom of the v and w are a little distracting, but
    I love the font, and the name is quite nice also.
