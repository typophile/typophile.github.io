  an artist and designer. I like to create/design every aspect of my projects and
  I&#39;ve now gotten into type design. My question is: what are some basics I should
  keep in mind when designing type? For example, as far as I know, you are supposed
  to start with certain letters and then design the rest of the alphabet? Anyway,
  any suggestions will be very helpful! Thanks!'
