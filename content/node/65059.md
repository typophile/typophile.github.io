body: "I want to have a different version for a letter everytime you type the letter.\r\nFor
  example if you type a A and 30 letters later you type a A again then it should be
  the A.1 version.\r\n\r\nA------------A.1------------------A.2-----A.3------------A.4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  code would be something like:\r\n\r\nsub A @all @all @all A' by A.1;\r\nsub A @all
  @all A' by A.1;\r\nsub A @all A' by A.1;\r\nsub A A' by A.1;\r\n\r\nAnd that for
  every letter and alt version which makes the code really big.\r\n\r\nIs it possible
  to use a lookup for the @all part?\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\nsub A' <lookupname> A' by
  A.1;\r\n\r\nWhere the lookup is used for:\r\n\r\n@all;\r\n@all @all;\r\n@all @all
  @all;\r\n@all @all @all @all;\r\n\r\nSo the lookup can be easy re-used for the B
  and C etc. (and A.1 A.2 ...)\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a more simple way to archive this?\r\nI
  tried some things (with different code) but i moslty end up in:\r\n\r\nA/A.1/B.2/A.3/A.4/B.5\r\n\r\nwhere
  i want it to be:\r\nA/A.1/B/A.2/A.3/B.1\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso i can't get the lookup from
  the opentype feature file specification to work:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.f.i\r\n\r\nI
  get the error:\r\naborting because of errors:\r\nsyntax error at \"lookup\"\r\n"
