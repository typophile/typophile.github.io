  get at any office supply store, with a couple different tip widths, a calligraphy
  marker, and a brush pen.  First time I have ever used a brush pen. Kinda falling
  in love with it.  However, it is much much too small.  I'd like to find one that
  could spread to about an inch diameter or so.  The current one I have might go up
  to an 1/8th of an inch or so.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    makers use pieces of a kind of felt that they cut to measure to use for making

  body: "Yes, a felt tip marker.  This does look pretty close.  Id be using it to--what
    else--create brush script fonts. The only other thing that would be nice is if
    it was refillable with an ink cartridge, like these:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dickblick.com/products/pilot-parallel-pens/\r\n\r\n(though
    these are NOT brush pens)\r\n\r\nBert, no not really looking for calligraphic
    style markers.  If you have never seen a brush pen their tips look and behave
    pretty much exactly like a pointed tip brush would, though they are made of one
    piece of material, not a bunch of fibers glued together.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PentelBrushPen_5435.jpg]\r\n\r\nIts
    kind of hard to tell from the picture but the tip is not as hard as a regular
    marker, it is very flexible, and the width of the stroke is not changed by rotating
    the pen in your hand to a certain angle, as with a calligraphy pen, but by how
    hard you apply downward pressure.  They are really quite fun to mess around with.
    \ You can go very lightly and have an extremely fine, whispy line, or you can
    press down hard and get a very thick line."

    remember an exercise we did in art school: roll up a piece of fabric, flattish
    or spiral like. Secure with piece of string, dip in ink or paint and go for it.
    Adjust its behaviour by cutting with scissors, etc. In other words: build your
    own equipment. (We used reeds, sponges, carrots, wood splinters, household stuff,
    hand and feet\u2026)"
