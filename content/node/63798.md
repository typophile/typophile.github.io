body: "Seems like we must be doing something right out here in the boonies. Accolades
  for the press have been received from all over, and we're particularly proud of
  the kind words of the fellow type lovers and bibliophiles among our clientele.\r\n\r\nWhile
  we strive for modesty, we also recognize that economic survival requires a bit of
  banging on one's own drum from time to time. So in gratitude for the generosity
  of our clients and colleagues, we thought we'd share some of these...\r\n\r\n<em>\"Peter
  runs the old press for contemporary clients. Beautiful work, a pleasure to work
  with.\"</em>\r\nErik Van Blokland - Letterror, The Hague, The Netherlands\r\n\r\n<em>\"Peter
  is an expert letterpress printer who does faultless, crisp, elegant work.\"</em>\r\nMark
  Batty - Mark Batty Publishers, New York\r\n\r\n<em>\"I met Peter via Association
  Typographique Internationale, years ago.  I was already very impressed by his skills
  in various areas, from calligraphy to typeface design. As printer, Peter, with the
  great background gained over the years and natural skills in graphic arts, produced
  very high quality printing, but with this touch that only rare persons have, because
  of their knowledge. I recommend him!\"</em>\r\nJean Francois Porchez - Porchez Typefoundry,
  Paris\r\n\r\n<em>\"I give my highest recommendation to Peter Fraterdeus, (Slow Print
  Studio), for this reason; he has a clear understanding of what matters in printing
  beautiful work. He understands that what matters is everything! It is refreshing
  to see someone who has the passion to treat every detail as an opportunity to show
  how much he cares.\"</em>\r\nGregory Corrigan - Technical Director, Hamilton Wood
