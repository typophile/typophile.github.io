  body: "I think it's calligraphy as well. None of the repeated letters (two'i's,
    three'a's, two 'o's, two 'h's) match. That would be a LOT of alternate letters
    for a font to have.\r\n\r\nIt is beautiful. I hope I'm wrong and it is a font.
    Especially with that many alternate letters!!"

    has a somewhat similar, if a bit less expressive, feel.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
