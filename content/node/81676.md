body: "Opentype opticals are supposed to be optimized for specific point sizes. I
  have the chance to use Chaparral Pro opticals in a project, but I'm unsure about
  something. The \"problem\" is that I have to work with really small body text. Size:
  7.8\r\n\r\nNow, according to the [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1718|official
  Adobe guideline]], the 'regular' font is designed for 8.4-12.9 points. Does that
  leave me with the 'captions' design for setting my body text? It is designed for
  1.0-8.4 points. Is it that simple? How do you think I should proceed?\r\n\r\n(I
  attached a sample. First page: regular. Second page: captions. 7.8 points.)"

  body: 'The caption weight seems appropriate for a 7.8 size text. But looking at
    your pdf I noticed that you''ve used, both in the regular and caption settings,
    the Light version, which seems very uneasy to read at that small size! So I would
    try first to typeset the entire thing with the Normal version before proceeding.
    (Chapparal light works very fine for titling, in bigger sizes). Anyway, I don''t
    think there is a general "rule" for using the optical sizes with the exact points
    recommened by Adobe: I think they''re more like suggestions.'

  body: "Yes, I went with the Light version because it seems to me that it gives more
    contrast to heavier weights than the Normal does. At any rate, I tested the Light+Regular
    version - it looks fine in print.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering if it looked better
    with Light+Captions. I'm not sure whether there is any notable difference between
    'regular' and 'caption' besides tracking, which is obvious. Maybe it's a bit \"heavier\".
    I thought maybe there are other subtle differences that I don't see, that make
    it more suitable for smaller sizes, or that only show in print."

  body: "I took a look close-up in photoshop, and it appears that the main difference
    is the tracking, but the letters are a tiny bit wider in light caption and a hair
    thicker (barely).\r\n\r\nI think it was originally a Multiple Master font with
    weight and optical-size axes. Later they re-released it with a static selection
    of weights and optical sizes. These were probably just created by interpolation
    on the MM axes, so the variation seen between Light and Light Caption is from
    the optical size axis.\r\n\r\nYour best bet is probably to print it on a good
    laser printer and see which your eye prefers (assuming this is a print project).\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I find Chaparral Light to have a lot less character than the Regular - the light
    has very little contrast and looks almost like a monoline font."
