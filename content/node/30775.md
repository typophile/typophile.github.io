body: "hello all,\r\n\r\ni am about to purchase fontlab 5.0.2 very shortly. for the
  time being i will be using it on a mac at my office until my new mac pro system
  arrives. i was wondering if after purchasing the product are there any restrictions
  on installing it twice on two seperate machines with the same serial number (basically
  having it installed in two locations?) i wasn't able to find documentation on this
  but then again, i may not have been looking in the correct area on fontlab website.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n_will"

    seems reasonable - many type designers have a main desktop machine but also need
    access to FontLab from their laptops on the road. '

  body: "good point, si. seems a little unreasonable at times to be chained to the
    confines of one computer in this day and age. hypothetically, i'd be a bit chagrined
    having installed my copy on a laptop and then crap out of luck when i go to install
    on my 'type studio' workstation.\r\n\r\n_will"
