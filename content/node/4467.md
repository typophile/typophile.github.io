  last week, <BR>called &#34;Buchkunst der gotik&#34;. It&#39;s really <BR>very nice
  and all, with some amazing color <BR>plates and a great bibliography. Except I <BR>can&#39;t
  remember why I checked it out. Some- <BR>body had probably recommended it to me
  but <BR>now even leafing through it I can&#39;t find any- <BR>thing that specifically
  interests me. Help!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
