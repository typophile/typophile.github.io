  I've been reading a lot about type designers and their meticulous ways.\r\n\r\nI
  was wondering,\r\nIf these are the same (type of ) anal people who come up with
  the built in kerning info / pairs, why do we still need manual kerning?\r\n\r\nIs
  this mainly personal taste?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    really only does the basic minimum for you, and is fine for body text. But now
    let's say you're designing a logotype or book cover. The overall context of any
    specific setting can change how letters ought to be kerned so that the whole word
    looks consistently spaced. If your design calls for really tight letterspacing,
    every letter may best be kerned from scratch.\r\n\r\nImagine you've done a bold
    logotype for a company called INNERHIM. Nice straight sides you can shove together
    like books on a shelf, and the extra space made by the R's tail is acceptable
    because it falls at a semantic division (You would probably go for an overlap
    if the same RH were in, say, MINIRHINO). Now the company says it wants the same
    look but its name has been changed to OVERLACKY. Can you at least leave ER the
    way it was? No, because there is so much necessary space between all the other
    letters, ER will look too cramped if it is not loosened to match. This is an extreme
    example for the sake of explanation, but smaller decisions of a similar kind have
    to be made all the time."

    because it\u2019s a totally different spacing system, for headlines\u2014as opposed
    to Tracy\u2019s method, which is for body text and book faces.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I have used the method you suggested, for instance in Figgins Sans:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Smooth_4737.png]\r\nHere,
    I applied positive kerning to round-round combinations to get the effect, which
    doesn\u2019t appear to detract from body text settings.\r\n\r\nQuark XPress enables
    editing of tracking according to size, and also custom kerning of fonts. However,
    it does not enable varying kerning according to size."

  body: "<cite>Lately I've been reading a lot of articles on kerning and I've been
    reading a lot about <strong>type designers</strong> and their meticulous ways.</cite>\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, if you go back to the Dark Ages -- before, say, 1992, programmatic kerning
    was done by compositors. For years, Linotype gave as one of their reasons for
    sticking with the 18-unit em for kerning & I believe tracking values was their
    customers wouldn't want to change their kerning programs. Their customers, of
    course, were all typesetting shops. As if we couldn't multiply by 3... (Yup, the
    new em was a 54-unit em. Don't remember the year - late 1970s? -- Nick Shinn would
    probably know.)\r\n\r\nTo this day, except for Matthew Carter's fonts, if a font's
    primary use in our shop  is to be for setting text, the first thing I do is throw
    out the foundry kerning. Matthew's kerning is almost always to my taste, just
    not quite extensive enough, esp. with punctuation.\r\n\r\nThere is a point to
    this nostalgia. There is pretty much no way a type designer can get all the needed
    kerning, and absolutely no way they can accommodate all legitimate differences
    of taste on \"proper\" kerning. Don't blame them if things aren't to your taste.
    \r\n\r\nTypesetters are not people who only know what the \"place\" command is,
    and can fill out paragraph styles. They have other responsibilities. In the end,
    proper kerning is the user's job."

    is losing relevance as WWI history becomes more boring; the latter is gaining
    relevance as wine becomes more interesting. My Mana series of <em>bitmap</em>
    fonts has both those kerned. I average ~8 kerns per glyph, all hand-made - no

    me handsomely). Caveat: I have yet to deal with very large charsets.\r\n\r\nWhat
