  body: Probably a custom(ization?) job and by [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/23292553/Neptune-Suite|Denis
    Olenik]] (but you probably already knew that). The only uncommon letter here is
    /S to me, rest could be easily approximated starting with a contrasted sans. Even
    if it's too wide comparing to the original, Aviano [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-gothic|Gothic]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-contrast|Contrast]]
    is nice alternative with a /S in the same vein.

  body: "Just to clarify; when I said that the letters in the image are \"derived
    from\" Moehring's Florida of 1932, I don't want to give the impression that Denis
    Olenik used this as the basis for his letters. I merely meant that Moehring's
    design was the origin of this genre of typeface. It is possible that Denis Olenik
    created his letters without being aware of the existence of the Florida typeface.\r\nDon"
