body: We have a PowerPoint presentation built in PPT 2010 with Franklin Gothic Book
  throughout. When this deck is opened by users within our company that have Office
  2013, PPT says the font is Franklin Gothic Book but the font appears different and
  as a result the formatting is off. Is Franklin Gothic Book missing from Office 2013?
  Should we pick a different font to ensure compatibility across different versions
  of Windows and Mac OS?
