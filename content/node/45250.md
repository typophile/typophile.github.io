  studio to personalize otherwise anonymous business cards (we have many and they
  were expensive, I gather). Also would love here opinions on the pros cons of rubber/wood,
  and ink (think pads at staples) versus something perhaps more paint-ish.\r\n\r\nthanks
  much!"

  body: "Howdy,\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, that was a little vague - which may have something
    to do with the fact that I'm quite inexperienced in the finer art of stamping.\r\n\r\nI'm
    thinking I want to embrace the unpredictability of stampage, as some of our employees
    relative stampage techniques may, in fact, be quite garbage.\r\n\r\nIs it better
    to have a thinner face or a heavier one for better distribution? Is one easier
    to handle than the other?\r\n\r\nDoes a goofy/ornate handle improve stampage in
    any way?"
