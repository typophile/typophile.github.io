  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As mentioned in <a href="http://typophile.com/node/29342">this thread</a>, I&rsquo;ve begun working on digitizing some calligraphic letterforms to build my first attempt at an OpenType font (for the moment this is just an experiment). So far I&rsquo;m still roughing in the letterforms by tracing scans in Illustrator, cleaning up the drawings, drawing new/missing glyphs from scratch (that is, literally drawing them and then tracing in Illustrator), then bringing the vectors into FontLab, but this process has produced a wide range of node totals. In one glyph, for example, I might have 200 nodes (remember, these are calligraphic forms), while another might have 600.</p>
<p>This is producing far too much variation in the consistency of the vectors, not simply in terms of the amount of information, but the &ldquo;edges&rdquo; of the forms are, in some cases, far too &ldquo;rough/detailed.&rdquo; So, I&rsquo;ve been cleaning them up by hand to get the balance I want from one glyph to the next.</p>
<p>That said, what I&rsquo;m wondering is how many is too many nodes-per-glyph? At what point is the font going to get sluggish with too much information? For example, should I shoot for an average of 100, 200, 300 nodes?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you look at P22 Zaner Script by Paul Hunt, you will get a good idea.  As usual, the ideal is to have as few nodes as are needed to draw the curve you wish. A swashy script will need far more than a geometric sans of course.
I would rethink your &ldquo;draw in Illustrator first&rdquo; strategy. You would be beter off starting your tracing in FontLab and getting fewer bad and un wanted nodes. If you are starting off witha scan, maybe a first cut with ScanFont then reshaped in FontLab might be a better solution.  Illustrator does some things to curves that may work fine as an illustration but can cause trouble in a font.</p>

<p>Dezcom, I&rsquo;m going to look at ScanFont &amp; try tracing a few glyphs in FontLab to compare the results with what I got from LiveTrace in Illustrator (using a combination of the Detailed Illustration and Type settings). Thanks for the suggestions.</p>

Some of the &ldquo;grunge&rdquo; fonts I looked at ranged from 150-200 curved nodes per glyph, up to crazy values like 3000 curved nodes (the latter fonts choked up my font manager real good). A handful used an average of 500 <em>corner</em> nodes, and these load very quickly, so the straight lines definitely speed things up, but also make it ridiculous to print at large sizes where the corners become obvious.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to shoot for 200 curved nodes per glyph, giving myself license to go up to 300 for complex charaters (I have an &ldquo;IOU&rdquo; glyph that&rsquo;s quite greedy).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jason, the reason straight lines <cite>can</cite> make sense is that irregularity is typically rendered on a very small scale where curves are not very visible, so you can in fact make things look more irregular by having let&rsquo;s say three times as many &ldquo;bumps&rdquo;, just straight ones instead of curvy ones. But of course the entire glyph doesn&rsquo;t have to be straights - you can mix things up as needed (although it&rsquo;s probably much more manual work).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you’re suggesting around 150 nodes as the max for curves?</p>

<p>I guessing at 150, but only if Goran&rsquo;s 500 is in fact some sort of real limit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to crack open a few “grunge” fonts &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a caveat: just because you can open them doesn&rsquo;t mean they work well enough when they hit rasterizers, especially legacy ones. So try to look at ones from good foundries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ex Ponto &amp; Old Claude average around 150 nodes, using curves

<p>Bingo.</p>

<p>Start TESTING with 300, but I&rsquo;d be prepared to go down to half that.</p>

<p>If you make an average number of the glyphs (since the whole font counts) what number would you be landing on then? I think this number is more important.</p>
<p>BTW, great looking script!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Let me appologize in advance for the long post with hijack potential. I wanted to encourage you to keep going with your original process of drawing, scanning, and refining. This is a process that I have used and come to love. What follows is a journal entry of sorts, documenting my thinking on the font I&rsquo;m currently working on &hellip; eventually I hope to pair entries with samples in a <em>making of</em> format (but not in your thread :-).</p>
<p>(my nodes average around 25-75 per glyph)</p>
<p><cite>&hellip; While speed was the catalyst that sent me down this road, I&rsquo;ve grown to love the process. Most <em>distressed</em> typefaces, by definition, start of as something clean. Some process is applied, and the result is a rough interpretation. The results tend to be static and lack an organic quality that I enjoy in a lively typeface. My process works in reverse, starting dirty and getting cleaner.</cite></p>
<p><cite>I start with letters drawn as tightly as possible at about 1 cm cap height. The small scale allows me to work quickly, taking in character relationships at a glance. There&rsquo;s so much freedom when you can draw a complete alphabet in minutes. It also introduces a lot of distressing. You can only draw so cleanly at that size because of the ink, paper, and hand shakes. </cite></p>
<p><cite>From here the work is refining the typically rough results scanned and imported into Fontlab. Proportions are generally good, but often need some adjustment. I find that organic quality not just in the letter shapes, but also in color variation within the set. With Olduvai, a serif type, there was very little color correction required. For my new sans though, there was a much lower tolerance for variation before the design just looked nasty.</cite></p>
<p><cite>As I adjust the letters I&rsquo;m reminded of the expressionist letters of Pressig. There is an approximation of curve, where the final curve is drawn in the eye of the user. I&rsquo;m not saying that this is how one actually reads text set in the font, but that you need only suggest form instead of defining it. While he chose to use straight line segments, I enjoy even more flexibility using distorted bezier curves. It is a fantastic medium to work in, unconstrained by the ever present desire to define a precise shape with the fewest number of nodes.</cite></p>
<p><cite>The freedom dawned on me fully when I tried to make a <em>clean</em> version of Olduvai. It was nearly impossible to nail down the suggested shapes in a consistent fashion. One letter isn&rsquo;t a problem, but capturing the spirit across a full set proved frustrating. I empathized with designers who&rsquo;ve tried to revive a metal face from rough letterpress samples. It surprised me though, because I had drawn the originals in the first place! There&rsquo;s something elusive about it, and I think that&rsquo;s the beauty of designing in the rough &hellip;</cite></p>
<p>GO FOR IT!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Randy, thanks for the post. I&rsquo;m in the same boat, I think, in that the process sounds similar, right up to the fact that I&rsquo;m planning to attempt a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; redraw of the font after I get the &ldquo;rough&rdquo; version finished (there&rsquo;s still lots to do). I appreciate your warning about finding a balance in the clean redraw, as I&rsquo;m anticipating the same challenge; the letterforms I&rsquo;m working with are very independent, each with its own personality, so finding such a balance won&rsquo;t be easy. In the &ldquo;rough&rdquo; version this works fine, but I&rsquo;m not sure how it might fit together as a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; font.</p>
<p>As for the tidying process, the tracing results I&rsquo;m getting from Illustrator are good, but do, indeed, require a lot of fine tuning. After simplifying &amp; hand-picking down from around 500-600 points, I&rsquo;m averaging 200 nodes per glyph (ranging from 120-300), and the font will be for display purposes only, so the character set will be quite limited (it&rsquo;s an all-cap font, with full and small caps, old style numbers, punctuation &amp; basic analphabetics), so I&rsquo;m thinking it will still funciton well. Hrant&rsquo;s mention of older RIPs is something to consider, but at the moment I&rsquo;m building this simply as an experiment. As mentioned in my post (linked above) there are larger issues at play if I were to ever consider releasing the font into the world.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Randy, that was very interesting.
(And it reminds me of those letters some 20th century type
designers would write to each other across the Atlantic.)</p>
<p>BTW, I think your method of rendering small letters for scanning is not only more conducive to nicely organic results, but in fact it possibly strikes a great balance of efficiency in terms of what needs to actually be scanned and traced digitally (I hope that&rsquo;s clear).</p>
<p>I would like to try that method&hellip; when I&rsquo;m ready
to handle it mechanically and psychologically.</p>
