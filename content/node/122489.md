  My name ist Karsten (alias PoohBear) and I have lately found this new interesting
  software fontforge. And it amazes me what one can do with the software, I am not
  into fontdesign professionally, but I am playing with the idea of creating my own
  stuff. I love to play with all kinds of things.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am not getting
  fontforge to kern those few letters that I have designed. I am testing those few
  letters \"ABCDEaoge\" in browsers by inserting    \r\n@font-face {\r\n    font-family:
  \"myFont\";\r\n    src: url(\"myFont.ttf\") format('truetype');\r\n}\r\nI have read
  that a font is no good without kerning, so I want do get it right from the start.
  Sorry if this post sounds newbie to you. But that is what I actually am. I've tried
  the options button before generating the font, checked \"windows-compatible kern\"
  and tried the oder checkboxes too. It simply doesn't work for \"Tage\"\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate your help.\r\n"
