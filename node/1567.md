  body: FYI -- I think the reason your jpg wasn&#39;t working was that it was in CMYK
    mode -- try RGB next time and see if that works better.

  body: 'I think so too, a vertically squished Bernhard Fashion. But in this case
    it actually looks OK. Maybe &#40;even dare I say it?&#41; better. Maybe it has
    been squished in a different way. Maybe it&#39;s too small to tell. '
