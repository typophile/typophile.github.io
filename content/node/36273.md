  body: "I have not been able to locate that in my Script Font ID Guide, or other
    type catalogs. The sample is very small, but the initial letters seem distinctive,
    and the only G like that I found was in one of the Poetica Swash sets, I think.
    However, as varied as Poetica is, I don't think it matches this script of yours.
    \r\n\r\nI have found that many stationers, like William Arthur, use either pre-digital
    typefaces, or else custom typefaces, as a way to maintain an exclusive look that
    cannot readily be copied. I may be wrong, but I don't think this is a commercial
    font.\r\n\r\nIn cases like this, my advice is to find something similar, instead
    of trying to duplicate it. The font that reminds me the most of your sample stylistically
    is Font Bureau <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/avalon/\">Avalon</a>.\r\n\r\n-

    for sale). It was designed by Robert E. Leuschke \xA92004 with the name SnagglePuss

  body: Thank you. I thought it might have been one of Rob Leuschke's fonts, but there
    was nothing in his list that matched it. However, I have seen it listed on an
    invitation addressing company's website, so I thought it might be for sale somewhere.
    But, I also know they wouldn't reveal where they purchased it. I'll just keep
    looking for something close. Florens Flourished is the closest I've found. Beau
    Rivage is another one, but some of the capitals are very different.
