    body: how can you tell that? It's also quite similar to ITC Bauhaus (I later found...).

  body: "There's a nice collection of types of this style here: http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html\r\nI
    think it's not a font because \r\n1) the way e-d and e-n connect seems so specific
    to those particular combinations - that n shape in particular would basically
    only work after an e, which is not how fonts work. \r\n2) there's only three different
    letters and they are very simple geometry, making the built-from-scratch theory
    more likely.\r\n3) there is clumsiness in the drawing (where the strict geometry
    creates awkwardnesses) that you're more likely to find in a one-off than in a
    *professional* font design (though of course amateurish fonts abound too). "
