  body: Line-spacing issues usually involve more than one line of type. Rather, are
    you asking about the apparent lack of kerning in the font?

  body: What do you mean by 'line spacing'? That normally suggests interline spacing,
    i.e. leading, but your illustration shows only one line of text, so perhaps people
    are too confused to respond?

  body: "Okay so perhaps my terminology is incorrect. My apologies. I'm specifically
    speaking about the difference of the gaps between the very top where the blue
    starts and the cap-height compared to the baseline and where the blue ends (see
    red arrows). \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inconsistent_5681.png]"

  body: Most capitals won't sit vertically centered in their space because that space
    is set up to accommodate descenders of the lowercase (and potentially Q and J).
    Maybe that accounts for what you're seeing.

  body: That's what I initially figured. It's just incredibly difficult to set a line-height
    and it output equivalent space above and below. I was hoping to not have to result
    to padding or margins.

    could try using a {vertical-align: -6%;} attribute to baseline shift. Not sure
    if this is more desirable than adding padding-top."

    use a Darwin-based model, designers would be just another failed mutation."
