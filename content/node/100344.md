    Charter BT Pro (Bitstream) and once upon a time there was also an Charter EF version
    from Elsner+Flake. I think the original design owner was URW.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI

    Bitstream donated the Charter font under terms that allowed modified versions
    of the font to be redistributed."
