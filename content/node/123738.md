    would be ok. As I didn't use the \"generic\" Champion name so I didn't see the
    MyFonts link.   Dick\r\n\r\n---edit:\r\nJust did a quick search here and there
    are quite a few references to Castcraft/OPTI so it seems a mixed view of their
    validity ..."

    of Matrix from Emigre. The two typefaces are relatively new. Opti was not good
    nor people on the site are not good neither.\r\nYou should not introduce such
    a site."

  body: "I do hope people note Akira's comment about OPTI.\r\nFor anyone who has not
    seen any of my posts about OPTI, here is the essential problem.\r\nOPTI/Castcraft
    has a notorious reputation of as a forger of unauthorized clones of digital fonts.
    \r\nA relatively small proportion of its fonts were original digital creations.\r\nUnfortunately,
    even the original digital fonts by OPTI are probably unusable for publication.
    OPTI is a defunct organization and these fonts are orphans for which there is
    no way of obtaining appropriate intellectual property permissions.\r\nIf a poster
    considers that there never was a digital version other than the one created by
    OPTI, then any discussion of this font should make clear that the font is in effect
    unusable.\r\nThis problem comes up fairly often. See for example the discussion
    in http://typophile.com/node/122803\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
