  is a college project in quite early stages for a shop that sells international food
  ingredients, vegan food, organic food etc. so it has to be quite neutral in terms
  of what the shop sells but a welcoming feel and a quality aesthetic are a must I
  think as well as looking quite cool to appeal to the younger generation of cooks
  as well as the ethnic families who would use it for general grocery shopping.\r\n\r\nI
  will eventually be developing a brand identity and all the accompanying material
  so while I haven't got that long to design the logo itself I want it to be high
  quality to support the rest of the work, hence asking you guys...\r\n\r\nmany thanks
  in advance, Matt\r\n\r\n<img>http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3234/3048132981_e6b5b6b277_o.png</img>\r\n\r\nps.
  it has been pointed out that the third looks like a logo for a company called pangur
  so that one while possibly the most successful in terms of simplicity is pretty
  much out the running"

  body: "this is tricky one for sure, and I don't have any specific suggestions, so
    I'll give you a bit of a brain-dump and hopefully that itself might lead to some
    solutions:\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Presentation of food</strong>\r\n\r\nwell, as a vegetarian,
    I know I wouldn't desire to see any form of meat on the store sign, even though
    I am rational and well aware that there will be meat, in all sorts of forms I
    may never have imagine it, inside the store.  Meat would be a turnoff.\r\n\r\nA
    vegan might be turned off by the suggestion of animal-byproducts.  This is your
    dairy, your honey, and things like that.  I can't speak *for* them, but I can
    certainly imagine they might not have the greatest feelings towards a cheeseburger
    or a honey-glazed ham.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of ham, jewish and muslim dietary laws
    forbid pork (kashrut and halaal) so think that if you are gearing this store towards
    religious or cultural groups as well, you're really going to have to do your research
    as to what they are and what would turn them away from a store.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are going to depict food, the caution is make it look like a grocery store, and
    not a restaurant.  Bread is generally safe for all groups, grains and vegetables
    are safe for all.  It's certainly a tricky way to depict a sign.\r\n\r\n<strong>2)Presentation
    of dishes</strong>\r\n\r\nWell, this certainly takes the emphasis from the food
    itself, and focuses more on the cultures.  The bowls are an excellent idea, and
    you might find a great way to symbolize multiple groups or cultures this way.\r\n\r\nCaution:
    don't forget a group - if you miss asian-styled bowls but have every other kind
    for example, an asian might assume that's because you don't have asian supplies
    there.  You either have to be specific and complete, or generic and inclusive.
    \ Make different shapes to signify diversity, but perhaps not actual depictions
    of specific cultures bowls (the colour you used is another way to show 'different
    bowls' even with the same shape.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) Depiction of diversity</strong>\r\n\r\nThis
    one would focus more on culture and international cuisine than even food or the
    dishes it's served in.  In my hometown we have a global food store, who uses a
    globe as their logo.  Travel Agency? that's the first thing that pops into my
    head, but it can be pulled off correctly.\r\n\r\ncaution here is to establish
    that it is without a doubt a food store. Generic flags might help, but it's certainly
    tough.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I haven't thought of a perfect super-awesome idea for
    you, I really wish I had, but I hope that these promote some thought and help
    you arrive at a solution sooner.\r\n\r\nBest of luck, and your designs look good,
    so I have no worries once you land on that genius idea (and you will) that you'll
    be able to pull it off woderfully!"

    types/lettering?\r\n\r\nSomething like this but ethnic? This was for the San Francisco

    ... gooey). \r\nI'm not sure if I'm influenced by any recent campaigns here, but
    that empty looking bowl plus the hands holding it, without a body attached to
    them, says \"Feed the Hungry\" to me, which is kinda not what this is about.\r\nAlso,
    since this is for a food <em>store</em> if I got that right, I must say I'm not
    sure about using dishes and spoons; actually all food stores I can think of off
    the top of my head don't use any 'food' imagery at all. Must say I like Mikey's
    idea to use a more abstract sign & focus on the diversity aspect. "

    on the current logos - someone thought steam rising from the bowl would clear
    up the fact that it's not infact empty so that's a simple one to try. Another
    one is the colours: warm them up to reflect savoury/sweet food aswell as the warm
    family atmosphere. Perhaps the orginal pink mixed with a more earthy orange might
    be quite cool. Yeah I've had enough of the spot at the bottom, it's a bit much.\r\nI'll

    I think you nailed it with number 2; the spoon says food while the curved drip
    is a nice visual pun integrating the type with the image. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou could
    consider:\r\n \r\n1) a wooden spoon to emphasise (or emphasize) the natural/vegan
    side a bit more and move away from the western-style utensil. \r\n\r\n2) the apostrophe
    being a wee leaf instead of a drip - very veg and says ingredient instead of finished
    product. would also play well if the rest of the image and type were black/dark
    grey (gray) for contrast. Solid colours will also translate better across different
    mediums (business cards, signs, websites, napkins, glasses, windows...you get
    the idea).\r\n\r\nNice choice of typeface. Cap 'm' feels a little uncomfortable
    esp. as 'international' has a lowercase 'i'. I would prefer to see 'mata's' all
    lowercase with 'international food' smaller, all caps and letter-spaced; type
    can be quite subjective but definitely worth spending a bit of time on as it will
    make the logo.\r\n\r\nWhat you're looking for here is a good idea (which i believe
    you have) \u2013 the rest is just tweeks.\r\n\r\nhope this helps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What about world utensils instead of bowls? Chopsticks, spatula, tongs, knife,
    fork and spoon. Obviously need to be careful to not appear as a kitchen store.
    IMO, you need a clearer and stronger idea in your design if you are going to choose
    to use an icon. You will never have the best logo if you simply draw a picture
    of something and set words, however nicely styled. I fall into this trap often.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    show us your work in black and white (no color, no gradients, no grayscale to
    hide behind). I think this will help you a great deal as you seek to clarify direction.
    Plus it will help when the client says, \"we want to silkscreen our logo in one
    color on reusable hemp shopping bags.\"\r\n\r\nBTW, Matta's is a great looking
    word. But I dont think your type choices are doing it justice. I think a more
    spontaneous, organic, wordmark (no picture of anything) might provide excellent
    foundation for an identity system. Have you tried drawing the word? Or lettering
    something with better lockup? Perhaps there is a subtle way to twist the lettering
    to reveal a deeper concept (without being gimicky). This can often produce an
    excellent result.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n"
