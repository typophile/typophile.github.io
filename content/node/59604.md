body: "Trying to decide between two designs for the website for a software product.
  The product is a file backup utility and it's main feature is the simplicity and
  transparency of its user interface. Though not at the expense of lacking features.
  Light, uncomplicated and obvious would be another keywords.\r\n\r\nhttp://swapped.cc/tmp/option-1.html\r\n\r\nhttp://swapped.cc/tmp/option-2.html\r\n\r\nWhich
  one does look more fitting ? If they are about the same, which one looks more \"pleasant\"
  (by whatever subjective criteria) ? A simple \"#1\" or \"#2\" would work as well.
  \r\n\r\nI have 50/50 split between a dozen of people I polled so far.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    which you go with. Personally, I''m drawn to the first one, perhaps do to it feeling

  body: "50/50 :)\r\n\r\nThe layout-wise - yes, not that much different, but what
    I was more wondering about is an overall impression. \r\n\r\nFirst version is
    \"framed\", second is \"open\". Also first one is also decorated a bit more, which
    makes second one look more simplistic in comparison. Perhaps <em>overly</em> simplistic,
    and that is my primary concern."

  body: i prefer the first one, because as aluminum say it feel contained and more
    secure than the second where the design feels lost in the page (i have a very
    big screen and it's obvious on a big screen). With data backup, contained is good,
    and make look the technology is more controlled (?? i'm not sure it's the good
    word in english but i hope you see the right meaning). very good work anyway.

    about the second one being possibly lost on the page a little bit. I also like
    the centering and margins on the first one; it really does seem clear and straight

  body: "Here - yes, in general - no, a good third of people prefers #2.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I started using http://feedbackarmy.com and it is quite useful for gathering
    the feedback from random people. Basically you submit a URL, phrase some questions,
    pay them a fee and they post your request on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. If you
    haven't seen Turk before, [[https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome|have a look]].
    The most clever side project that came out of Amazon to date. Answers do vary
    in quality obviously, but there is an option of rejecting the answer if it is
    not good or off the subject.\r\n\r\nThe most popular remark against #2 was \"too
    much white space\", especially on larger monitors with high resolution .. which
    is something that I would've never picked up on my own as my monitor is not of
    that kind. All in all, pre-release feedback rules.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot guys, your
    answers helped a lot. We are starting public beta on Monday. If you feel like
    dropping by, do drop by :)\r\n"

  body: We finally put [[http://www.bvckup.com|the website]] in production today.
    Design-wise it ended up being neither of the above, and I think it still came
    out nice and clean. As per usual - any thoughts or nitpicks are greatly appreciated.
    Thanks, guys.
