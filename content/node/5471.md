body: I&#39;ve been sketching on a typeface that is pretty heavily inpsired by Futura,
  but at the same time completely different.  It will be elegant yet futuristic. <BR>
  <BR>But has it all been done already?  There&#39;s only so many ways you can design
  a simplistic single-story geometric sans &#39;a&#39; that you can design.  And would
  it be considered plagiarism if some of the glyphs share common features? <BR> <BR>I
  think, pretty much, that subconsciously I just want someone to give me an okay &#40;&#34;go
  and do it&#34;&#41; before I can start on this project. =&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks!
  <BR> <BR> <BR>P.S.  How long do typeface copyrights last?

  body: In the USA, as far as I know, copyright applies to the font software, not
    the typeface design. You can trademark the name, and you can register a design
    patent for the design. However, registering patents and trademarks costs money,
    and even if you get a design patent it will cost more money to enforce it. <BR>
    <BR>Speaking as somebody who has recently designed a sort-of-geometric sort-of-sans
    serif typeface, I think there&#39;s still room for original design in this area.
    Of course, I went for a two-story &#34;a&#34;.... <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thomas, <BR> <BR>Thank you so much for your help.  That&#39;s all the push
    I need.  I think I will try to step away from Futura though, there are several
    Futura-inspired typefaces already... Avant Garde and Century Gothic to name a
    few. <BR> <BR>What I think I would want to create in my typeface is a sense of
    simplicity... something that could have been easily drawn using a stroke or two,
    but at the same time have a quality that says &#34;I wish I could&#39;ve thought
    of that&#34;. <BR> <BR>I will start working on the font and use it in my own work,
    and maybe put it on myfonts if it looks okay.  Because I know I would get a kick
    out of it if I saw other people using it as well. <BR> <BR>Thomas, thanks again.  I
    admire your work a lot!

    you have me confused with somebody else? My actual type design work has been seen
    by hardly anybody; most people know me mostly as a technical guy and occasional
    writer. This is not an entirely bad thing, since most of my early type design
    attempts were pretty uninspired.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>However, my latest typeface is not too bad, and
    will be released as an Adobe Original in, oh, maybe 5-8 months? The upright Latin
    portions are pretty much done, but I have more grunt work to do on the italics
    &#40;though the Latin italic designs are pretty much locked down&#41;, the Cyrillic
    still needs some work, and the Greek is only now starting to not suck too badly.

  body: Ah, well thanks then! <BR> <BR>But, my job title notwithstanding, I&#39;m
    not really the head typography honcho at Adobe. IMO, the closest you&#39;d come
    to that is David Lemon, who manages the type group at Adobe. Now, that being said,
    there are really three independent reporting structures, so I guess you could
    say that between David &#40;engineering&#41;, Harold Grey &#40;marketing&#41;
    and me &#40;program management&#41;, we run the joint. But Harold and I don&#39;t
    have anybody who reports to us, so I dunno. <BR> <BR>I look forward to being able
    to show the typeface formerly known as Geode publicly, but it is not currently
    scheduled. Frankly, we have a number of more impressive releases slated ahead
    of it, such as the new &#34;Pro&#34; version of Bickham Script, Robert Slimbach&#39;s
    new &#34;Garamond Premiere,&#34; and another new design of Rob&#39;s we haven&#39;t
    even talked about yet. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'BTW, one random piece of advice: geometric typefaces are rarely &#34;really&#34;
    geometric. They still have all the same kinds of optical compensation found in
    other typeface designs. Or at least they usually do if they&#39;re any good. So
    circles are rarely circular but are slightly taller than wide, vertical parts
    are a little thicker than horizontals, all that usual stuff. <BR> <BR>In this
    regard, it&#39;s quite interesting to study the difference between the drawings
    Paul Renner did for Futura, and what Bauer did with them to make a real typeface.

  body: 'Thomas, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the great advice.  I was debating with myself
    whether or not to optically compensate the typeface or not.  Aesthetic side of
    me won over my mathematical side that prefers everything to be even and square
    &#40;and never crossing the lines, as in the &#39;o&#39; crossing the baseline&#41;.  I
    just have to fight the instinct.  =&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve read Paul Renner: The
    Art of Typography by Burke &#40;well, mostly looked at the pretty pictures&#41;,
    and I was amazed by his drawings.  The early renderings for Futura were really
    groundbreaking.  He had some really nice alternative characters, many looking
    stencilized.  I&#39;m not really familiar with Bauer though, is that the same
    guy who did Bauer Bodoni? <BR> <BR>Looking forward to seeing Geode and Garamond
    Premiere. <BR> <BR>By the way happy 4th to everyone here in the US.'

  body: Bauer was, at the time Futura&#39;s release, one of the largest German type
    foundries. They had offices all over Europe, but I think that their headquarters
    was in Frankfurt. They no longer exist as a unified company, but one of their
    subsidiaries is still chugging along in Barcelona. <BR>They own the name and the
    trademarks, etc

    <BR>Lauri: You really do have to do the optical compensation stuff. If you don&#39;t,
    the typeface will just look &#34;wrong.&#34; Futura would have been a flop if
    Bauer had just cut Renner&#39;s original drawings. <BR>  But obviously you understand
    this already. <BR> <BR>Bauer Bodoni was the best of the early 20th-century Bodonis.
    However, personally I give ITC Bodoni the nod as being the best Bodoni revival
    as far as what&#39;s available in digital form today. <BR> <BR>I used to not think
    much of Bodoni, based on the crummier digital versions kicking around. But my
    perspective changed dramatically when I first got to look through an original
    copy of Bodoni&#39;s &#34;Manuale Tipografico&#34; about 9 years ago. It&#39;s
    just a stunning piece of work, and really shows off his original metal type designs
    to their best advantage. His original types had a number of subtleties not found
    in most revivals, and the letterpress printing process on the softer papers of
    the time really softened and warmed the lines that so often seem harsh and cold
    in digital versions today. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T'

    was comparing the sketches of my typeface to some geometric sans faces at myfonts

    to have some humanistic forms.  This is only a sketch... I know there&#39;s some
    major issues I have to work on.  More optical adjustments, the loop on the &#39;f&#39;
    should lean more to the left, the way the line connects to the circle in the &#39;p&#39;
    should be a lot softer, the &#39;e&#39; needs the angled cut, etc, etc.  This
    is just to show where the typeface is heading. <BR> <BR>Any feedback is appreciated.  Thanks!

  body: Hmmm. Interesting. The diagonal cut stroke ends are interesting, and give
    it a more playful feel, making it feel less harsh than, say, Bauhaus or some of
    the other faces that have some of the same design principles. Definitely going
    to be a display face, though! <BR> <BR>Lots of optical fixing needs to happen,
    but it&#39;s kinda cute so far. One shape that just fundamentally isn&#39;t working
    for me is the &#34;y,&#34; though. Also, the &#34;m&#34; seems awfully narrow.
    Not that it should be twice as wide as the &#34;n,&#34; but it should definitely
    be noticeably wider than the &#34;n&#34; in a geometric face like this. &#40;Same
    for the &#34;w.&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents. I&#39;ll be
    interested to see the next rendition.... <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    look a little bit weird.  I was experimenting to see how many shapes I could reuse.  For
    example: &#39;b&#39; -&#62; &#39;d&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, and &#39;q&#39;; &#39;m&#39;

    a display face.  I was thinking of maybe having a diagonal crossbar on the &#39;e&#39;,
    but I&#39;m not sure about that yet.  Also, I&#39;m not really sure how to approach
    the the uppercase letters since I want the same soft feel to them, and uc&#39;s
    are often &#34;harder&#34;.  I&#39;m also planning to have several weights of
    the typeface...starting from really light. <BR> <BR>But I have to take a break
    from the development for a couple of weeks, I&#39;m going on a tour with a band
