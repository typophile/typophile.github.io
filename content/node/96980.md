  . \r\nI only found out that: \"The logo itself consists of the name in a digital
  font, inspired by a mid-20th-century Italian one found in an old type specimen book.
  \". Looks like the whole CELINE website uses that font. Any ideas what it may be? "

    be interested in something like Novecento:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/synthview/novecento/\r\n\r\nOr
    some version of Semplicit\xE0:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/semplicita-pro/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo/"

    \"celinefont\" and mainly to the lowercases, confirms the custom job based on
    Simplo, as suggested by riccard0.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/celine_6298.png]"

    body: "Yep, but the inspirational font is <em>Semplicit\xE0</em> by Alessandro
      Butti. \r\nPaul Shaw has only partly right: \"Semplicit\xE0 was the most popular
      sans serif in Italy\" until the seventies (not only \"during the Fascist era\"),
      when it was abandoned and practically forgotten."
