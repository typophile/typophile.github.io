body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\ni am looking for a typeface i found in an old book from 1927.
  the type shows the typical \"unregular\" signs like different densitiy of letters
  or different leading (i hope thats the right word).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldtyp1_3654.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldtyp2_4432.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldtyp3_3623.jpg]\r\nis
  there a typeface available similar to the typeface in the book? i guess there wont
  be one with this raw, used look sparked off the old printing technique but maybe
  you can help me anyway."
