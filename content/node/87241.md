  is Julia and I'm a German student. I follow typophile.com for quite a long time
  and I'd like to start a topic on myself.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about sans serif
  typefaces with a short f descender (not italic), for example in fedra. Do you know
  other typefaces in which it works? I noticed fedra in a long text and getting used
  to the descender version. I thought about using it for my own typeface I'm working
  on at the moment. Perhaps it would also work with a little \"tail\". \r\nSo what
  do the experts think? I'm looking forward to get your point of view. :)\r\n\r\nGreets\r\nJulia\r\n"

    Never mind! \r\nobviously Hrant is eager to hard-proof a newbie ;-)\r\n\r\nFedra
    demonstrates that a descending f (and possibly: \u017F, \xDF) can work pretty
    well. By the way, it is also possible with serif faces. Did it myself."

  body: "Thanks for your replies.\r\n\r\nAndreas, danke :-)\r\n\r\nI also think that
    a descending \"f\" does not necessarly worsen the readability. I noticed several
    serif typefaces where it appears more common to me. I fear that it might look
    a little incorrect in sans typefaces, although fedra is a positive example, like
    Andreas said. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's really quite simple: it has nothing to do with \"incorrect\",\r\nit's
    that we read \"expected\" boumas and a descending \"f\" destroys\r\nthose pre-built
    expectations. How quickly can we build a given\r\nbouma expectation that over-rides
    (or at least coexists with) all\r\nour previously built expectations? Good question.
    Until somebody\r\ncan convincingly answer that question with \"in minutes\", I
    will\r\nstick with the view that a descending \"f\" harms readability.\r\n\r\nNow,
    it's entirely OK to sacrifice some readability (it's never\r\nperfect anyway)
    intentionally* but it's not OK to pretend no\r\nprice is being paid. THAT is nonsense,
    as is thinking that one\r\ncan evaluate readability by reading a little bit.\r\n\r\n*
    I've done that myself in Patria by making\r\ncertain letters atypically wide,
    in order to\r\nreinforce the character of the face.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    not to say I consider the \"f\" in Fedra a mistake, it's just not my thing."

  body: "That surprises me some Hrant.  I would have thought you'd be in favor of
    it, since it provides extra information to the eye since no letters (except \xFE)
    have both an ascender and a descender.  Or does it cause too much relationship
    to the written form where it does descend (always cursive, sometimes print)?  "

  body: "<cite>a descending \"f\" destroys those pre-built expectations</cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hrant</strong>,
    why do you think it destroys expectations? Italics have their own style, changing
    many upright forms. I believe reader expectations are mainly determined by the
    kind of design he/she was used to \u2013and italic f with descender is an usual
    form since long time.\r\n\r\nI agree that a no-descending italic f may be more
    coherent, but I do not see readability sacrifice in it. Anyway, this is an interesting
    question.\r\n\r\nI have another kind of worry. Descending italic f is hard to
    diferentiate from f with descending left hook (Unicode 0192, companion to uppercase
    0191). This may justify a no-descending f in a font supporting non-European languages.
    (Actually, many less used Latin characters conflict to the usual way italics and
    swashes are designed.)\r\n\r\n<strong>Julia</strong>, for the reason above I do
    not recommend to use a tail if the font aims wide language support."
