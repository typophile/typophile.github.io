body: "This is Omnium Sans. He is the shy younger brother of Omnium Serif. He hasn\u2019t
  actually talked yet but he seems very reserved and he has a much quieter personality
  than his sister. He has similar aspirations, but tends to follow in her shadow,
  supporting her and allowing her to have most of the glory. This dynamic makes them
  happy playmates, I think.  \r\n\r\nLike his older sibling, Omnium hopes to grow
  up to be a text typeface. His family history suggests that he\u2019ll be about 10pt
  tall. His sister is a semi-light-- more of a book than a regular\u2014and he hopes
  to follow in her footsteps, appearing the same colour on the printed page.\r\n\r\nThey
  definitely have the same parents, or do you think the postman was involved?\r\n\r\nA
  PDF of Omnium Sans can be viewed here:\r\n\r\nhttp://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/Omnium_sans_30.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
  Typophile Thread for Omnium Serif is here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14576\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d
  love to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDan\r\n"

  body: "I can see the family resemblance!  :-)\r\n\r\nThis is looking pretty solid
    already. The caps especially are actually really good; this is a font that should
    have smallcaps. The \"m\" and \"C\" are a bit wide. The bar of the \"K\" stands
    out a bit too much. The \"Q\" has too much serif in it. I'd make the \"T\" a bit
    narrower. The bottom of the \"U\" is malformed.\r\n\r\nFor 10 point, it's pretty
    light, and a bit loose. In fact I think it would be useful to match the serif
    in color and fit. If we assume the serif to have stabilized, the sans should be
    a bit tighter and slightly darker.\r\n\r\nI predict this sister-and-brother team
    is gonna be famous, in\r\na starlet kinda way I mean, not like the Osmonds or
    anything.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Here is a <a href=http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium_sans_65_ital_44.pdf>revised
    version</a> of Omnium Sans. I\u2019ve added the italic and small caps.\r\n\r\nAlong
    with some minor changes to the character shapes, I\u2019ve increased the weight
    of the roman slightly and tightened it up considerably. I\u2019ve had a lot of
    trouble with spacing the roman: in trying to match the serif in colour. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI
    haven\u2019t touched the kerning pairs yet.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your observations
    / criticisms.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "I have recut <a href=\"http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium_sans_107.pdf\">omnium
    sans.</a>\r\n\r\nI have further simplified the curves and terminals and have removed
    most of the flaring from the stems, so that it better matches its <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14576\">serif
    counterpart.</a> I see this sanserif as a secondary typeface for the serif, so
    I don\u2019t want it to compete for attention.\r\n\r\nI have also simplified the
    s, which I felt was disturbing the peace <a href= \"http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium_sans_65_ital_44.pdf\">before.</a>\r\n\r\nOh,
    and I\u2019ve loosened up the spacing some.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any feedback you
    can provide.\r\n\r\nThanks very much,\r\n\r\nDan"
