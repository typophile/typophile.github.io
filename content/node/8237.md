    target="_blank">short time ago</a>... how come you didn&#39;t recognize it then
    but nailed it now, Yves? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>..and since that thread was never closed, do
    I get credit for its ID? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    target="_blank"> nailed</a> this type before, even though it was after the thread
    you mentioned, Ryan. In that thread, Stephen Coles doesn&#39;t seem to think it&#39;s
    Perla, since he mentions Perla as an alternative. '

    of the many candles on the page that Nicci just showed us! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: So, Nicci, the consensus is that - though this isn&#39;t really Perla - <BR>that
    typeface is the closest match we could find. I hope this is  <BR>good enough for
    you.
