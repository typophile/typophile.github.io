  Condensed or something along those lines?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!"

  body: "Thanks guys, really appreciate your help. :)\r\n\r\nStickley: It's quite
    similar, but I think I prefer the look of the original font better than univers.
    But thanks!\r\nStephen Coles: Block Gothic is also very similar, but the apostrophe
    is very different. Thanks anyway!\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone identify the actual
    font?"

  body: This may not be Block Gothic, but remember, the user could very well have
    created their own apostrophe.
