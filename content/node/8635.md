  body: Thanks, all -- last night was great fun, and it was very nice to see some
    of the Bay Area Typophiles again. The warm response to the new movie was a fantastic
    birthday present.

  body: Cheshire, that&#39;s what I get for not checking the forums before the Film
    Fest started. Happy belated birthday, and thank you for sharing your day with
    us. Your films rocked the house last night!

  body: There once was a designer named Cheshire. <BR>If you asked him to ID a font
    he&#39;d say, Yessir! <BR> <BR>He made a great film about Cooper Black. <BR>And
    his reference to Hobo was whack. <BR> <BR>But when it came to the sequel on Trajan
    <BR>His Hollywood endictment was blatant. <BR>So we wish him the best of birthdays,
    <BR>And say, please don&#39;t get chiseled in the back!
