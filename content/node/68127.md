  on my goals:\r\n\r\n1) A calligraphic font that looks hand-lettered\r\n\r\n2) Rough
  imperfect edges\r\n\r\n3) Combining elaborate script upper case forms with more
  traditional lowercase calligraphy.\r\n\r\n4) Give alternate character options to
  optimize the hand lettered look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Calligcloseup_6065.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CalligSample_5507.jpg]"

  body: "Rob, this looks like it's going to be a wonderful typeface. I am very much
    impressed. \r\nBut you ask for suggestions, not for praise. Ok:\r\n* You have
    a great Th ligature. Let's have a Wh as well (\"Who\").\r\n* I think the regular
    a is not yet quite convincing, the little \"ascender\" irritates me.\r\n* Similar:
    g and y. I'd prefer these as alternative forms not standard ones. (see \"onyx\",
    \"jaunty\")\r\n* pp: I love the zippers, not the zappers.\r\n* I suggest a rt
    ligature (see \"advertiser\", \"smart\", \"quartz\").\r\n* The decorative Z crossing
    the following vowels in \"Zebras\" and \"Zoomed\". Purpose?\r\n* The figures are
    still uneven: 1, 2 too small, 3 4 5 6 9 too big. \r\n* alternative forms that
    do not connect lazy flowers and strawberry jam\r\n* what about a qu ligature?
    the q appears in most languages mostly in that combination.\r\n* t crossbar and
    y get a bit close in \"jaunty\".\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing what becomes
    of this project.\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Andreas,\r\n\r\nThank you so much.... your comments are EXACTLY what I was
    looking for... suggestions, not praise. \r\n\r\nI'll do the ligatures you suggested
    (fantastic idea),  \"Wh\"  \"qu\"  \"rt\"  \r\n\r\nzippers is a pp ligature in
    the font... zappers shows two alternate p's\r\n\r\nThe \"lazy flowered\" and strawberry
    jam combinations were typographic decisions in the text on my part. I could have
    chosen alternates that didn't touch, but in my actual hand lettering and calligraphy,
    I'ill often make the decision to let words and characters overlap for design purposes--
    it often prevents rivers from appearing in the overall texture.  \r\n\r\nThe uppercase
    Z is a different issue. I may need to create an alternate that doesn't overlap
    \ the next character. Right now, if they don't overlap, there appears to be a
    kerning/spacing issue, so that's why I chose to kern them to overlap.\r\n\r\nI'll
    modify the crossbar on the \"t\" alternate.  I can't say I like it either.\r\n\r\nThe
    Oldstyle Numerals--- a weakness for me. I'm not used to making them, and not sure
    how. I'll play with it and let you know. I'm not thrilled with their overall design
    appearance anyway, so maybe this will be the largest of the revisions.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again, if there are things anyone else sees, please chime in.\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n"

    g, and y 'ascenders'\r\n\r\nRevised the old style numerals. \r\n\r\nCreated a
    couple of Wh ligatures (one shown here).\r\n\r\nI've created several \"qu\" and

  body: "I like your work very much, and, yes, it's going to be a wonderful typeface.\r\nSome
    letters still bother me:\r\n- ligature Wh [narrower loop connecting W - h helps?]\r\n-
    I like your previous lc q, narrower\r\n- 5 is too wide\r\n- lc f (amplfied), I
    would prefer with descender, like (fawn)\r\n- UC F (Five) F without upper bar
    looks oddly\\hard to read\r\n- lc t (jaunty) is still to short\r\n- UC B (Back)
    could be more inclined to the right\r\n- UC U looks a bit like Y\r\nThe rest is
    OK for me.\r\nI have a supplication: Can you make UC Z with stroke? It is the
    calligraphic version of [Zdotabove]. My surname starts with stroked Z...\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes Rob"

  body: "Andreas and Janek,\r\n\r\nI think this is finished. I have take your all
    your suggestions to heart and I have tweaked this to death. I ended up completely
    replacing all the Roman Caps (including inferior, superior and smart caps). I
    created some new uppercase flourished characters, and added several more lowercase
    starting and ending characters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EstoniaSet_5172.jpg]\r\nIn
    all there are approximately 670 glyphs in the font, including the Z with stroke.
    \ :)\r\n\r\nI even added a ROB face. Let's see if the pirates include that in
    their rip off.\r\n\r\nIf you see anything else, let me know, but I think I'm ready
    to stick a fork in this, because it's done.\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EstoniaSample_6408.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhere
    you see ascenders and descenders crashing... those can be substituted with alternates...
    I was just too tired to go on."
