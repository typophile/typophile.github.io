body: i&#39;d like to take this opportunity to introduce myself,  as i just discovered
  this website this weekend, and i&#39;m amazed i hadn&#39;t sooner.   <BR>i love
  typography, but i definitely can&#39;t flatter myself to say i know even a quarter
  of what everyone else seems to know; i&#39;m just a [fourth year] graphic design
  student. <BR>i spent a few hours browsing the forums, especially the critique section,
  and i must say in that short amount of time i&#39;ve learned a lot. i definitely
  feel like i hit the lottery! <BR> <BR>thanks!
