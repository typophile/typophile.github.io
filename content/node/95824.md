  body: 'This is a companion volume to his ''Historical scripts: from Classical times
    to the Renaissance'' which is viewed as a definitive visual anthology. I have
    not seen the text for the new book and don''t think it will try to add anything
    to the scholarship of the subject (though I''m sure it will be well researched
    and written) but that is not the point. The point is the illustrations and I have
    seen some of these. They are a revelation and will make this a very important
    and exciting book. Stan has carefully overseen the enormous task of rephotographing
    every example illustrated and, most importantly, controlled the lighting so that
    the crucial three dimensionality and tactile qualities of the originals are revealed
    with the subtleties of paper texture, bite and ink squash. Suddenly the usual
    two dimensional reproductions look hopelessly superficial, inadequate to understanding
    and lifeless. A huge contribution and absolutely stunning!'

  body: "Sharon, thanks for your appraisal. I\u2019d read the description of the distinctive
    approach to the illustrations. While I love seeing the tactility as much as the
    next typophile, I\u2019ve been wondering if the raked lighting might not exaggerate
    the impression of the typefaces as much as illuminate. \r\n\r\nI suppose, in the
    end, I may have to pony up and judge for myself."

    printed.\r\nThere is a conflict between resolution and showing tonality, but nonetheless
    it will be interesting to see.\r\nIdeally, I would print the type as line art
    from super high resolution bitmap files, and the tonal information as a tritone
    halftone."

  body: 'I hadn''t read Oak Knoll''s blurb and can see it might make one think that
    the lighting has been used for ravishing but gimmicky typographic sensationalism.
    From what I have seen it is sensitively done to inform but you have made me think
    that there is no such thing as an objective reproduction - and, from the Dwiggins
    analogy, that the brain is inextricably involved in what and how we see. More
    decision making and bias pitfalls in Stan''s approach than simply flattening everything
    out in two dimensions - but realise how crass and distorting that is too! There
    is no neutral. Clearly we need both approaches yet Stan''s also get''s closer
    to pointing to the truth that there is no substitute for perception that comes
    from encountering real thing - ideally handling it too. I have only seen some
    glossy prints so it remains to be seen how the reproductions  survive the production
    standards of the book. I''ll certainly buy a copy!  '

    something similar, Sharon. Even if the lighting does exaggerate a certain aspect
    of perception, these reproductions should offset the \u201Cflattened\u201D perception
    of any other reproductions and provide another, important reference point for
    evaluation. Sounds like this is probably as good as it gets, short of seeing the
    originals for oneself.\r\n\r\n"

    very interested to see how this book\u2019s photos will compare with books that
    make use of block-printed reproductions. I have seen a few dozen German books
    made between about 1900 and 1950 that reproduce historical books pages this way
    (well, primarily via etchings), and most of those are sub-par, from a type design
    analysis point of view. The type is usually made far too heavy in these reproductions.
    Sort the \u201Cdipping letters into chocolate\u201D effect. These reproductions
    were made with the highest quality methods possible at the time, too; the publishers
    weren\u2019t skimming on the printing or paper costs.\r\n\r\nI saw a book printed
    in the UK earlier this year that reproduced things in a similar style (<em>E.R.
    Weiss \u2013 Typography of an Artist</em>). I think that it used multiple polymer
    plates \u2013 one for each color \u2013 made from high-res scans. This worked
    pretty well, especially because the paper it was printed on."

    in the original British Library / OUP edition of Scholderer's <em>Greek Printing
    Types</em> (1927). The reproductions were printed collotype, which gives an excellent
    impression of the stroke density of the originals without the ink gain problem
    of block printing that Dan describes.\r\n\r\nIs anyone aware of any books that
    use stochastic screening in reproductions of historical printing?"

    museum book reproductions of paintings and such; but no, I\u2019m not personally
    aware of any reproductions of historical printing that have made use of the technique."

  body: 'We used stochastic screening for the Microsoft <em>Mathematical Typesetting</em>
    book, initially because we used different colours to differentiate text elements
    in illustrations and couldn''t afford spot colours. I was really happy with the
    result, although if there is even a slightly imperfect registration there will
    be a light haze around the coloured letters, betraying that it isn''t a spot colour.
    I particularly encourage anyone who has a copy of the book to take a look at the
    ClearType screenshot on page 38 through a loop: being able to see the colours
    of the individual pixels of 12pt type on 145 ppi at actual size in print was only
    possible with stochastic screening.'

  body: 'There were sample images in the latest Oak Knoll catalog that showed some
    very dramatically lit images. They looked good, but it all depends on the actual
    book printing. Oak Knoll books can be hit or miss in image quality and judging
    from the pdf (http://oakknoll.com/resources/bookexcerpts/105522.pdf) this might
    be another coarse K-only job.  '

    a post-modern perspective, it\u2019s a question of authenticity: should a reproduction
    be \u201Cwarts and all\u201D (which would include paper color), or should it be
    optimized and updated to remove reproduction of the original paper color, allowing
    the \uFB01bre of the reproduction\u2019s paper to substitute for the original?
    I\u2019ll be interested to see what approach this new book takes.\r\n\r\nPatina
