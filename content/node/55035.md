  are the instruction\r\n\r\nPlease see the following attachments for info. You will
  see 2 files...one> with 2 cars only and one with 2 cars on a background of stars
  and a map etc. We would like **JUST THE 2 CARS** seperated for 4 colour process.
  I assume you use Adobe Photoshop? Please send the file unflattened. The other file
  with the background is for a visual only as this is intended for a full front about
  10\" wide.\r\n\r\nand here are the images......\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/car

  body: "Separations refer to the 4-color printing process (on an offset press) where
    you separate the colors (CMYK) to 4 printing plates. Normally your printer can
    handle this (in fact I'd highly encourage it). But occasionally a designer will
    have to prepare the files. Anyhow see http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7794a.html\r\nfor
    how to create/print separations. \r\nAlso a read of http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-779da.html
    would be recommended as well.\r\n\r\nFinally I recommend working in RGB until
    you have everything finalized before converting to CMYK."

  body: "I think you are worrying too much about the 4 color process. Photoshop automatically
    takes care of that issue, assuming that you have the color setting preference
    set for either US web coded (SWOP) v2 or US Sheet-fed coated v2. This can be achieved
    within photoshop by going to edit/color settings, a dialogue box will open with
    drop-downs under Working spaces. I recommend that you set the RGB to Adobe RGB
    1998 and the CMYK to one of the settings I mentioned ( sheet-fed or web). If in
    doubt, contact the printer and they will guide you.\r\n\r\nThat's it. If you want
    to check out the separations click on channels window in photoshop and turn on
    and off the channels and you will see the CMYK on their own. Unless you really
    know what you are doing, leave them alone.\r\n\r\nThere are advanced corrections
    you can make to the images using adjustments such as curves, levels etc. but for
    now I think this will do.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nG."

  body: "Well, if he is asked to make color separations, I guess that is what he has
    to do.\r\nIt is true Photoshop automatically has the 4 colors each on a different
    channel, but I presume his client wants these in seperate files as well. The first
    link bemerx25 has posted shows how to do this.\r\n\r\nI do wonder why they want
    you to do this, though, since most modern printers will separate colors themselves
    with their RIP.\r\n\r\nYou should go back to the client and ask what it is he
    wants exactly. Does he really want 4 files each with 1 color? For what printing
    technique is this going to be? Etc.\r\nFor offset printing I don't see why you
    should separate the colors yourself. If it is for screen printing I could see
    why, but even then I think most screen printers will take care of it themselves...\r\n\r\nAlso,
    this isn't exactly graphic design work, but prepress or DTP."

  body: "This may be a case of the blind leading the blind. I regularly get requests
    from people companies who use the wrong terminology (which ends up confusing everyone
    involved), or just plain don't know what they're talking about/asking for.\r\n\r\nArtsions,
    you should probably get more info from these people about what specifically they're
    asking for. I suppose they could be asking you to save it in DCS format, which
    splits up the file into separate CMYK files, but I haven't seen those used in
    years.\r\n\r\n\"Also, this isn\u2019t exactly graphic design work, but prepress
    or DTP.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, but definitely something a designer should know."

  body: Was the image of the two cars sent as a single jpg? Maybe they mean separate
    the cars from each other, and the background, and convert to CMYK format. More
    clarification from the client is needed at this point.

    separations; just color space and layering (alpha)."
