body: "Hello,\r\na german typographist visited me in my magazine: www.bleisetzer.de\r\nShe
  told me about \"Letterpress Shops\" in San Francisco where she \r\nis working. She
  said there are around a dozend of these shops only\r\nin SF.\r\n\r\nWhat I understood
  is: All these shops seem to be in a shopping marl.\r\nThe people join the shop,
  and they produce a e.g. greeting card together\r\nwith the typographist live on
  the screen. Of course they hold some dozends\r\nof standards on their Mac. But its
  possible to change logos and, of course,\r\nan individual text.\r\n\r\nMy question
  is:\r\nDoes someone know any of these letterpress shops in US or wherever,\r\nusing
  a website to choose the artwork (out of a database of standards)?\r\n\r\nWould be
  a great help...\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGeorg\r\n"

    as far as I know, most shops do original designs (weather from a computer or hand-setting
    the type) rather then rely on standard templates.\r\n\r\nCustom, handmade, one-of-a-kind...it's
    kinda the whole point of using letterpress.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal
