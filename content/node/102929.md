body: I've tried all of the different font identifiers online with zero luck so far.
  This is a font that is similar to Georgia but has some subtle outlining. I've had
  this font on my machine in the past and for the life of me I can't remember what
  it was called. Please help! Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4355.jpg]
