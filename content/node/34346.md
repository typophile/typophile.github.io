  body: "it really looks like my <em><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/34152\">Miranda</a></em>
    in an ultra light version! I'm curious to know what is this font too.\r\n\r\nmaybe
    some ultra light Peignot custom font\u2026 (but the S and the C don't look like
    Peignot)"

  body: "If Dennis Ortiz-Lopez had a <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olradiant/\">Radiant</a>
    Ultra Light it would be a lot like this. I don't think some white stroking would
    quite get it though, because the C isn't quite as closed as the sample.\r\n\r\n-

    target=\"_blank\">this MyFonts forum post</a> by Takeshi (a regular who is almost
    never wrong), it might be \u201CFashion Thin\u201D by Alex Wiederin. Where he
    got the name from, I don't know - but the typeface appears all over in the portfolio
    of <a href=\"http://www.buero-newyork.com\" target=\"_blank\">Buero New York</a>.
    This includes several entries from Another Magazine.\r\n\r\nI find the website
    very irritating to navigate."
