  a little more readable. Light with flourishes. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    more legible competitor or indeed any. Some of the other Weischer fonts may fit
    the bill.\r\n\r\nTim"

    _\r\nHe used to have a site, but it seems to have been taken over by some leech.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the few places you can see those fonts in action is in\r\n\"Alphabook: Typeface
    Design & Application\" by R Walton (1999).\r\n\r\nBTW, Simone, pardon the intrusion,
    but since you're in LA:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/30444 _\r\nIn case you or
    somebody you know might be\r\ninterested, the class will run again in the Fall.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
