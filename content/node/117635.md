  Lining\u201D enabled. Currently I've got the (beautiful) Founders Grotesk by Klim
  Type and this works fine. I can't seem to find any other fonts that have this feature
  though, even Gotham Rounded!\r\n\r\nHow can you find out what fonts allow for Tabular
  Lining? \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: As a default setting, or with OpenType? I cannot imagine anyone would release
    a text font without tabular lining figures accessible with OpenType today (unless
    it is one that is solely intended, and only usable, for typesetting novels).

  body: Most text fonts have digits that are all the same width. But that doesn't
    mean they would have the OpenType feature of Tabular Lining enabled or even recognized.
    I can't tell you if that will be a problem or not.

  body: "If you have <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/texlive/\">texlive</a> installed
    (<a href=\"http://www.tug.org/mactex/\">MacTeX</a> on OS X), you can use the line
    command <a href=\"http://www.lcdf.org/type/otfinfo.1.html\">otfinfo</a>. For instance\r\n<PRE>\r\n
    \ otfinfo -f *.[ot]tf | grep Figures\r\n</PRE>\r\nlists all .otf and .ttf fonts
    in the current directory with one of the features lnum, onum, pnum, tnum and gives
    you which of these features figure in the font.\r\n"

  body: In most fonts, the default numerals are tabular and lining, whether or not
    there is any OpenType feature to access them. The absence of the OpenType feature
    code should not be taken as the absence of the relevant styled glyphs.

  body: "I guess we can deduce the default from the features available (if some are
    present). For instance for  Palatino Linotype coming with Office <code>otfinfo
    -f</code> gives\r\n<PRE>\r\n onum\tOldstyle Figures\r\n pnum\tProportional Figures\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhich
    means that one can switch to Oldstyle and to Proportional, meaning that the default
    should be Tabular Lining. On the other hand, with Brill, <code>otfinfo -f</code>
    gives\r\n<PRE>\r\n lnum\tLining Figures\r\n tnum\tTabular Figures\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhich
    means we can switch to Lining and to Tabular, and we may deduce that the default
    should be Oldstyle Proportional.\r\n"

  body: And in fonts that have only one type of figures, you could probably check
    the font file to see if all figures are of equal width. If that is the case, I
    would always assume the figures to be lining (instead of hanging). Or are there
    any fonts that only include tabular old-style figures?

  body: "How do you check the width without opening the file. The advantage of line
    commands is that you can batch process (if you can write bash scripts). You can
    take hundreds of fontfiles and tell which features are present. For widths, you
    would need a Python script. One case I find  troubling is Cambria which gives\r\n<PRE>\r\nCambria.ttf:lnum\tLining
    Figures\r\nCambria.ttf:onum\tOldstyle Figures\r\nCambria.ttf:pnum\tProportional
    Figures\r\nCambria.ttf:tnum\tTabular Figures\r\n</PRE>\r\nand I see no way to
    guess the default (but that is irrelevant with the question that was asked; you
    probably need to know the default only if you are stuck with an old version of
    Word).\r\n"

  body: "I don\u2019t know much about how to extract the relevant information from
    the font files. I\u2019m just saying that the method of checking the presence
    of OpenType features fails in fonts that don\u2019t have any (which are abundant).
    What I have described is simply one way of finding out if the default figures
    are tabular lining. Whichever way you do this, it seems relatively easy and errorproof
    to me."

  body: "What you have described is a way do determine if the default is tabular (and
    without checking for features). That can be done with the following script using
    ffPython (the Python coming with the latest binaries of Fontforge for the mac).\r\n<PRE>\r\n----\r\n#!/usr/bin/env

    \   break\r\nprint tab\r\n----\r\n</PRE>\r\nIf you put that script in the executable
    file <code>tabular</code>, then calling\r\n<PRE>\r\ntabular &lt;fontfile&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\nwill
    tell you if the digits in the range 0x30, 0x39 are the same width or not."
