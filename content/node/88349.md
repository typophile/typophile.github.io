body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ff-ernestine_6123.gif]\r\nAt long last,
  after three years of work, I am extremely happy to announce the release of my first
  commercial typeface, FF Ernestine, with FontShop International today!\r\n\r\nMicrosite
  with typeface showings and further info:\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\nGet
  the fonts here:\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/ernestine\r\n\r\nThis typeface
  took its first little stumbling steps at the CAS Type Design program in Zurich,
  as well as right here on Typophile, where Ernestine's own <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/53395\">critique
  thread</a>, started in January 2009, has seen it mature quite a bit. \r\nAfter I
  stopped posting updates there, I teamed up with Hrant Papazian, who drew an Armenian
  companion to my Latin design while I was making the Italic. We've drawn four weights,
  and every font now encompasses almost 1200 glyphs (in the complete \"Pro\" version).\r\n\r\nMy
  warmest thanks to my friend and project partner Hrant, to the brilliant folks at
  FSI who have taken such good care to make Ernestine really ready for market, to
  friends and teachers from the CAS 2008 class, and last but most certainly not least
  to Typophile itself, especially Ben, Craig, Sindre, and everyone else who helped
  this insane journey reach an actual, tangible end. \u2665"

    took a leap of\r\nfaith and agreed to let me make an Armenian component (nicknamed
    \"Vem\", which\r\nmeans \"monolith\") and even convinced FSI to publish their
    first Armenian design!\r\n\r\nNow the fun part will be watching Ernestine used
    widely and wisely.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Ernestine either from fontfont.com or from fontshop.com. Only the latter is offering
    Pro and Offc versions. What's the strategy?"

    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ernestine\">fontshop.com</a> should
    sell the same versions \u2013 3 formats (OpenType, Office, Web) \xD7 2 character

    Somehow, I (or some part of my brain) was expecting these options to appear in

    I also did a bunch of things in really roundabout ways (and/or multiple times:
    for instance the spacing of the Roman was completely re-done 3 times over the
    course of the project). I am sort of hoping the next one will be quicker. Too
    daunting otherwise :-)'

    I trapped the Armenian.  :-)\r\n\r\n* Actually, I should say the first that I

    sale on FF Ernestine Pro family packages* is only good for 2 more days. On 1/1/2012
    all prices will hit \xABnormal\xBB levels. \r\n\r\n*Specifically, intro prices
    are good for all 3 \xABPro\xBB family packages: <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/ernestine/packages#45674\">OT
