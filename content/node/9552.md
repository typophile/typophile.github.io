body: I&#39;m a Mac user thinking about buying Virtual PC to test fonts under the
  Windows environment. <BR> <BR>At the moment, I am thinking about buying the Win98
  version instead of the XP version of Virtual PC, mainly down to speed concerns.
  Apparently Win98 runs a lot faster. <BR> <BR>Are there any major differences in
  the way that Win98, Win2000 and WinXP handle fonts that I should be aware of? Things
  such as OpenType support, and what not?

  body: Yes! David, <BR> <BR>Win98 is a MSDos based Windows using a mixture of 32
    and 16 bit programms. Windows2000 and XP are based on the NT concept - true 32
    bit software.  <BR> <BR>You should test your fonts on win2k/XP. But a older real
    pc system including a windos bulk license should be cheaper.
