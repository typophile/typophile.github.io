body: "Hi there\r\nI have a problem with my Adobe FDK build OTF fonts in InDesign
  CS4. As you can see, the selection of text is only from the x-height down to somewhere
  below the baseline. And when change the text, it's size or style the space around
  the black selection does not change/update. Very annoying. What could be wrong?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/error_4719.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nClaus"

  body: Perhaps the vertical metrics. Is the font's UPM 1000? Have you ran the font
    through CompareFamily?

  body: That looks like the caret height and refresh problem resulting from a CFF
    font having a UPM other than 1000. But I thought that had been fixed in CS3?

  body: "I think I found the problem. I'm assuming that you're generating the PFA
    file from FontLab Studio (v5.0.4), yes?\r\n\r\nWhen the font's UPM value is different
    from 1000, FontLab Studio generates the PFA file with incorrect FontBBox values.
    The FontBBox values are correctly displayed in the \"Key dimensions\" pane of
    the Font Info dialog; but the values in the generated font will be different.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PFA_FBBox_3442.png]\r\n\r\nFor
    quick workaround, just open the PFA file in a text editor and edit the FontBBox
    values to match what's displayed by the Font Info.\r\n\r\nBTW, CompareFamily quickly
    pointed me to the reason of the problem. <strong>Single Face Test 15</strong>
    (Warn if Font BBox x/y coordinates are improbable, or differ between head table
    and CFF) output the following message:\r\n<strong>The font bounding box in the
    hhea table '(-322, -512, 2306, 1798)' differs from that in the CFF table '[-157,

  body: "Hi Miguel\r\nThanks a lot for looking into this. It halfway worked, now the
    rendering updates as it should. The only thing is that the selection still looks
    like before \u2013 that is only colouring from the x-height and down to somewhere
    below the baseline. This is a minor issue, so let's not waste time on pursuing
    that.\r\n\r\nClaus"
