body: Figured this is the place to ask... <BR>I have never designed a font but would
  like to.  Are there any good reference places online?   Not necessarily a &#39;how-to
  from scratch&#39; but more like advice taking it from sketches to flushing out a
  polished font. <BR> <BR>thanks! <BR>

  body: Flattered. Yes, but also a little weirded out. <BR>I&#39;m not very worship
    worthy. Honest. <BR> <BR> <BR>To your question m leavitt, where do you live? <BR>I
    ask, because I&#39;d suggest taking a class from someone. <BR>I just realized
    you might be asking more about the digitizing process. Is that your main question?
