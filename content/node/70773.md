  font I can find is Futura Display, however it's not quite right. Look at the lower
  case t and uppercase P...it's not a match. Anyone have any ideas? Any variants of
  Futura Display or fonts derived from it?\r\n\r\nAlso, this logo dates back to the
  90s. So it couldn't be anything designed within the last 15-20 years."

    of that \"t\" makes me think this is an amateur job. Also there\u2019s no overshot,
    although that might pass in this style."
