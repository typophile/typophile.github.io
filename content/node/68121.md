  body: Has anyone pointed out why it doesn't work? I'm just being curious here. Personally,
    I like to use http://www.sphinxsearch.com/, which performs pretty well after you've
    figured it out. Also, as the search box requires Flash for some reason the experience
    isn't as smooth as it could be.
