body: "I\u2019ve been hearing a lot lately about development for Arabic and the Indian
  market, especially Devanagari. I was able to speak briefly at TypeCon with someone
  in the industry who is investing in developing Arabic typefaces. I was surprised
  there seemingly isn\u2019t very much conversation about and very little interest
  in developing for the CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) market. Piracy combined with
  the amount of investment required was cited.\r\n\r\nWhy is there so much excitement
  about India and the Middle Eastern market right now? The same disregard for intellectual
  property is present. Could someone give some additional insight?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJDooley

    of interest. I think it all depends on the person with whom you speak. ;-)\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    part of the recent interest in such fonts is due to the improved infrastructure
    to support them, specifically that more applications and text engines are able
    to correctly handle the line layout and typographic challenges that those scripts
    pose.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV Type Development\r\nAdobe
