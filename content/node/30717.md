  the engraved version was built-in?\u2014but I'm not sure how to use them without
  pecking around the glyphs palette. Is there some Opentype feature that lets me use
  these conveniently?"

  body: "hi there:\r\n\r\nIn the application that you are working in: press \"apple
    t\" (that is, the apple button on the keyboard and the letter t at the same time).
    The window that appears is called the font panel. In the botton left portion of
    this window is a pulldown menu (it has star looking thingy with a triangle pointed
    down). Click it and select the typography panel.\r\n\r\nThis will open up a seperate
    window. You now have access to all the typographic features of Hoefler text. This
    happens to be one of my personal favs so I use it quite a bit. But this is not
    just the regular version of hoefler text that you can buy...nope... this a special
    truetype version exclusive to apple. When you type words that require ligatures
    such as: fig, waffle, affinities etec, the ligatures are automatically put in
    place.\r\n\r\nAnd yes apple did licence the engraved style. I think you have to
    choose any of the non italic styles and then in the typography panel select engraved
    text.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/download/pdf/using_fonts_osx_tiger.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
    document will tell you more about Apples stance on typography (languishing if
    you ask me). It also shows you an overview of the fonts included with your system.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I first started working with my mac I thought all fonts do these nifty automatic
    features. Only some of the fonts that come with OSX do this. If you want to buy
    fonts that do these things look for opentype or even better opentype pro fonts.
    (standard) Truetype and Postscript fonts don't do anything automatically- even
    if they do have ligatures or other styles.\r\n\r\nhave fun and post back if have
    more questions,\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "All of the above is true - *if* you're using an AAT application, such as
    Apple's Pages or Keynote.\r\n\r\nHowever, the system version of Hoefler Text is
    an AAT font, and has no OpenType features, so you can't simply turn on those alternates
    in OpenType applications such as InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop and QuarkXPress
    - you'd have to use the Glyph Palette (in InDesign, Illustrator or QuarkXPress).\r\n\r\nSorry,\r\n\r\nT"
