  of the American \"War on Drugs\". \r\n\r\nI'm curious, what fonts, if any, evoke
  some sense of money or finance to you? Particularly anything that might excel in
  both text and headline settings would be helpful (Engravers MT need not apply).
  The book has a good amount of body copy but is certainly not a novel. \r\n\r\nThanks
  for your input! \r\nZack"

    good, readable text face coupled with a strong, evocative headline face would
    probably be preferable. Paying too much for the fonts would definitely add the
    <em>eluding</em> aspect.\r\n\r\n"
