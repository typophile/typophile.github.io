  body: "i think the kerning of the <strong>l</strong > and <strong>o</strong> in
    <strong>lo</strong>ngsent can be a bit tighter. also, like what hrant suggested,
    the <strong>g</strong> needs a bit more work.\r\n\r\nsince the dragon logo is
    geometrically very circular, i think it'll be worth an exploration to apply those
    curves to the text. might not work, but then again it can."
