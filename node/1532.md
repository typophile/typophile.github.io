    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s like the type-IDers secret handshake.

  body: Hi Lars, sorry that I didn&#39;t get back to you about  <BR>Rookledge&#39;s
    International Type Finder, but I have  <BR>been &#40;a&#41; very busy and &#40;b&#41;
    without e-mail notification  <BR>the past few days. I see you&#39;ve found the
    information  <BR>yourself and Karen has been so kind to direct you to  <BR>the
    previous thread where it got mentionned and  <BR>explained &#40;THX Karen&#41;.
    <BR>Now that e-mail notification seems to be working  <BR>again I hope I&#39;ll
    get back to normal speed.

    to most of us but we still weren&#39;t able to  <BR>find it. It&#39;s a bit like
