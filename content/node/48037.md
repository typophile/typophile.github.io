    I think \"Anatomy of a Typeface\" has some too, but I'm travelling so I can't
    check easily.\r\n\r\nT"

    biography of Paul Renner. Thomas is right that there are a few in <em>Anatomy\u2026</em>,
    but they\u2019re cropped and cleaned-up b&w images of production drawings so they
    aren\u2019t really good examples. Also, check with Jos Buivenga who might have
    hi-res versions of the images of his drawings that were used in a recent online
    profile. It would also be worth sifting through old images of ID, Baseline, etc.
    for drawings in their profiles of type designers."
