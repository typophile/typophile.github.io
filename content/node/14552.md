  body: "Daniel, that's a bit pushy, the release section is for stuff like this, and
    it will be removed by a moderator.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you make an annoying flashing
    icon using your font, and make brief cryptic comments, that would be an acceptable,
    low-effort way of promoting your wares in General Discussions."

  body: "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nI know that you are excited about your new font release.
    But posting a notice in three different forums at the same time isn't exactly
    necessary. Nick is correct: this information really belongs in release only. However,
    you could also post a NEWS article (especially because of your sale price).\r\n\r\nThe
    way one posts NEWS articles on the new Typophile site isn't so clear. If you (in
    the future) go to the the page, you'll notice that (for now) all posts have been
    posted by moderators. Just click on one of their names, and send them your text.
    We'll post it for you.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to delete this thread, for three reasons:\r\n1.
    I'm a new moderator, and don't want to go willy-nilly deleting threads, just because
    I can.\r\n\r\n2. Discussion has cropped up on this thread. I'm always for discussion,
    even if it starts off on a less than perfect foot.\r\n\r\n3. You are new to posting
    here, as Dav correctly points out. I'd like you to stick around, so I'm going
    to give you the benefit of the doubt.\r\n\r\nBUT, I am going to delete your post
    in the DESIGN section. No one needs three posts to say the same thing.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with the type sales, Daniel!"

    can diss my type any day, Yves, but to take a wack at a first time poster? Is

    first time poster at all, I just commented on the typeface he so eagerly advertised
    in three areas of Typophile at once*. <em>Open discussion forum</em> implies we
    all can voice our personal opinion, even if it is less favourable and not to everyone's
    liking.\r\n\r\nI won't be getting into a fight over this, so if anyone thinks
    I went out of line, let me know and I'll apologise. This is not worth staining
    my already dodgy reputation. :^/\r\n\r\n<em>*If I *had* attacked him personally,
    I might've commented we don't take spam-like posts lightly at Typophile. Which
    I didn't. Admire the restraint.</em> ;^P"

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if my post upset some people, that wasn't my
    intention at all. Was I trying to advertise my font? Yes, I'm not denying that.
    If I did that in the wrong place and too many times then I'm sorry for that also.
    I was simply trying to self-promote myself, and my font, and I apologise if that
    came across as being arrogant. This is not an easy game to play, after all; there
    are hundreds of thousands of fonts and it's difficult to make 'one' stand out.
    Thank you to everyone for your comments and critiques.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDaniel
    Keith Bale"
