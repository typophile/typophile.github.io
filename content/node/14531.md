body: "Recently in a type ID request, one has brought up the issue of CANON corporate
  typeface. Their new marketing campaign started back in 2003 features a new typeface.
  It can be best seen in <a href=\"http://www.brochures.canon-europe.com/getFile.php?productid=8071&languageid=1\">the
  PDF brochures </a> they provide for download on the website. PDF indicates the typeface
  to be Denda New. Same information appears in a <a href=\"http://www.e-hippocampus.de/download/StyleGuide_HippCan.pdf\">
  brand guidelines manual </a> for another CANON Company.\r\n\r\nJudging by the overall
  look and feel of the new typeface, can you guess (or maybe somebody out there knows)
  the designer of the typeface and the foundry releasing it.\r\n\r\nTo me, the italics
  ressemble JFPorchez's LeMonde Sans Italic and the regular version has a Formata
  and Stella fell, but even Kievit wouldn't be too far away."
