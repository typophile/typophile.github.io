  body: "Whoever created this was not a conventional type designer. Nothing fits together
    as to style. It is either the result of ignorance or a conscious effort to make
    a disruptive image. Which would be appropriate for a movie about the end of the
    world, or the Dada art movement. \r\nRyuk's suggestions are good. Particularly
    if you pick letters and numbers at random from the three fonts and jumble them
    together. :)\r\nDon"
