  Stiftung\xAB:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.boell.de\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know this font? I thought
  it could be DIN or Mittelschrift but both typefaces don\u2019t seem to match exactly.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance :-) ,\r\n\r\nOliver"

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nyes, the \xBBGravur Condensed\xAB is a very good alternative:
      Thanks! I am agreeing with you that the kerning of the existing logo is really
      terrific. I did not design it but I am going to correct it :-)\r\n\r\nOliver"

  body: "\xBBGravur Condensed\xAB has rounded tips. The logo you link to does not
    have rounded endings.\r\nThe logo font is much more like a \xBBDIN 1451\xAB or
    a variation thereof. In fact, it is not DIN, however, it is so close as to call
    it a variation of DIN.\r\nThe upper bowl of the capital B is smaller on the logo.
    DIN's capital B has identically sized bowls both upper and lower. Also, the endings
    on the capital S finish with a straight edge on the logo, whereas DIN's capital
    S does not have such a feature.\r\n\r\nMore searching is needed.\r\n\r\nFor a
    DIN example of this company name, see:\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/luxuryluke/3081004809/\r\n"
