  body: ' &#34;The Art of Hand Lettering&#34; &#40;Helm Wotzkow/Dover&#41; is a good,
    rather comprehensive  book for hand-lettering, especially emphasizing proportion,
    spacing and color. Wotzkow also goes into some useful detail about the basic forms
    and structure of the various glyphs, even if getting a bit dogmatic about it.
    <BR> <BR>For someone interested in creating hand-drawn faces, a good, comprehensive
    type specimen book is always useful &#40;and fun to flip through for inspiration
    from time to time&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#34;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&#34; &#40;Jaspert,
    Berry &amp; Johnson/Blandford&#41; is a good &#40;if flawed&#41; one, among several

    is a good specimen of 18 fonts that will probably all be seen somewhere on the

    probably more useful to digital typographers, but couldn&#39;t hurt for hand-letterers
    too. '

    nothing beats Peter Bain <BR>and Paul Shaw&#39;s <I>Blackletter: Type and National

  body: ' Hi, here jacques writting. <BR>you should not forget to buy strong paper.
    I always explained people, drawing type is a lot about knowing how to erase. What
    I mean by that, is that you should be afraid of erasing, but should not erase
    so much, that you can&#39;t recognize the drawings anymore. <BR> <BR>Although
    some people might like them, I never used moulds&#40;is that the right word&#41;.
    Try get a feeling for curves by drawing them by the hand. You don&#39;t have to
    be able to draw them in one stroke.  <BR>Sometimes when I draw, I know from the
    beginning the curve I started to draw will be bad. You sometimes feel and see
    that strokes are under- or overstreched, or that it has the wrong character. <BR>
    <BR>What might help to understand the strokes, is to do a little bit of callygraphy.
    <BR> <BR>What john said is true. There are some very gut dutch books. For example:
    &#39;de theorie van de letter, by Gerrit Noordzij&#39;. Where he is explaining
    his theory of type, based on calligraphy and writting. <BR> <BR>Jacques '
