body: "This is a sticker I made a few weeks ago and depending on how the next test
  batch comes out I may resize it. This sticker is inspired by Shepard Fairey and
  his original Andre the giant has a posse campaign. While Shepard Fairey's art is
  focused on politics, control, propoganda, and freedom, mine focuses on the love
  of an image and the love of a person. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3-2_5095.png]"
