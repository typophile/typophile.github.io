  learned the difference between a typographer and a type designer; thrilled to learn
  that I may, in fact, be a budding typographer. I&rsquo;ve no illusions about ever
  being a type designer; to you types (ha!), I tip my hat in admiration.\r\n\r\nSO!
  Been reading articles and blogs, and &ldquo;Thinking With Type,&rdquo; and [[http://www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321534042|The
  Non-Designer&rsquo;s Design Book]] and others, and I think I&rsquo;ve got a good
  start. I&rsquo;m developing tastes. I&rsquo;m driving my wife nuts pointing out
  typefaces I recognize and typological (is that the word?) errors I see in the wild.
  \r\n\r\nNow I bring you a typeface pairing to see whether something I&rsquo;ve somewhat
  latched on to might pass the acid test of your expert opinions:\r\n\r\nAvenir for
  titles/headings/captioning, Centaur for body text.\r\n\r\nWeird? Discordant? If
  so, why? Help me learn.\r\n\r\nAlso, am I on the right track to be seeing similarities
  between Avenir and Museo Sans? Same question with Centaur and Kennerley Old Style
  (a.k.a. Goudy Bookletter 1911). Set me straight!\r\n\r\nLast question: why does
  this forum NOT change \"straight quotes\" into &ldquo;curly quotes?&rdquo;"

  body: "Welcome!\r\n\r\nCentaur is a beautiful typeface, as is Avenir in my opinion,
    but Centaur is very much rooted in old Roman type by Nicolas Jenson.  It has a
    very low x-height, fairly calligraphic/incised letterforms, whereas Avenir is
    a very friendly, open, 'modern' geometric sans serif.  Maybe choosing a more contemporary,
    open serif would serve you well - something like Sabon."

  body: Bruce Rogers' Centaur is not intended for small sizes, originally it was cut
    in 14 points. It has too low x-height, and is just too thin and too light for
    body text. I'd use Adobe Jenson instead, which is made in four optical sizes.
    Centaur really shines at larger sizes, though.

  body: "OK here's what I've learned so far:\r\n\r\n\"I like them both, and they both
    look old-fashioned\" doesn't make them harmonious. (With the Avenir, I was keying
    in to how a geometric sans had been nicely humanized. Avant Garde but not so avant-garde-y.
    With the Centaur - well, the source of the old-fashioned-ness is obvious.) The
    fact that Centaur is calligraphic and Avenir is slightly humanized doesn't make
    'em a match in your book. \r\n\r\nIf I want that vibe and I'm more attached to
    the hint of Art Deco I see in Avenir (again, am I off-base?), I'm supposing that
    I ought to seek a body-text serif font that is more of a modern homage to Centaur/Kennerley
    than a faithful revival of it. Something with a more stylish x-height. Possibly
    something with a touch of Art Deco lineage.\r\n\r\nI'll look into the Sabon and
    the Jenson, just for my education. While I'm at it: are either of those closer
    to what I've just described?\r\n\r\nAnd I do want to circle this back around to
    my question about Avenir vs Museo Sans. Do I err to see the former's lineage in
    the latter? Centaur vs Goudy Bookletter 1911, same question. Guess I'd better
    type out the characters and get to studyin' them.\r\n\r\nNobody has brought up
    \"typographic color\" yet, and I'm glad... I don't yet really have the discernment
    to see what's being referred to by the phrase.\r\n\r\nThanks for your responses."

  body: "<cite>Nobody has brought up \"typographic color\" </cite>\r\n\r\nYes, I did.
    The \"too light\" in my characterisation of Centaur is about colour. The concept
    is quite easy to grasp: Have a look at a page of continuous text from a distance.
    Centaur will look light grey. Jenson set at similar size will look much darker
    grey. \r\n\r\nYou're right, Museo Sans shares a lot of DNA with Avenir.  "

  body: "Ah, dying thread re-awakens without my intervention. How nice.\r\n\r\nMy
    particular, ahem, <em>challenge</em> for this particular application (which would
    be, types for personal marking/branding) is, I gravitate toward things that have
    <em>just a little bit too much</em> character/personality/quirks in order to be
    quite appropriate for the use I put them to. When it's for me.\r\n\r\nNot \"florid,\"
    but certainly not \"reserved.\"\r\n\r\nYou've pointed me towards tons of options.
    I'll go do my homework. \r\n\r\nWhile I'm at it, are there any Venetians that
    evince anything of the Art Deco aesthetic? I know that they're from two different
    worlds, but sometimes interesting stuff happens when worlds collide."

  body: "Thx!\r\n\r\nJust searched \"art deco venetian\" and found [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/fairfield/medium/|Fairfield]].
    Sharp. I'm concerned that it has too much in common with Bodonis and Didots; that
    they might be too delicate, have too much of a vertical stress, create that \"fencepost
    shimmer\" that is said to contribute to eyestrain. But definitely Art Deco, as
    is your Goldenbook recommendation. I must keep looking closely.\r\n\r\nGolden
    Type appeals!\r\n\r\nTime for me to run some tests. 2 x 3 grid I think, Avenir
    vs Museo Sans on the X axis, Golden Type vs Fairfield vs [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-kennerley/|Kennerley]]
    on the Y axis. Is it worth it to test Kennerley? Is it too much a display face?
    Is it <em>faux</em> Venetian?"

  body: Fairfield is more of a Didone (like Bodoni, Didot), not a Venetian. Its high-contrast
    appearance might be too "dazzly" and distracting for body text.
