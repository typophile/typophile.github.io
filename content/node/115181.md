body: "Hey everyone! I recently started a fashion/lifestyle blog and have discovered
  a new found love of fonts! I understand the typography of a page will change the
  overall feel of the entire page. I designed my logo using this free font: [[http://www.enfont.com/vni-thuphap.font]]\r\nI
  know there can be issues using free fonts as a logo so I did email the creator multiple
  times without a reply! That brings me to the first part of my question, do you guys
  think its ok to use the free font as my logo?? If so then here is an image of what
  I have [[http://imgur.com/d4FFeLv]]\r\n\r\nWhat I want is two fonts that will look
  great with the script logo. One that has more character and weight, for the post
  titles and navigation. Another that is easy to read for large bodies of text. I
  want something fresh and clean but still fashion forward, something that is not
  too serious or childish. I have been trying out the google font play fair display
  but its too orderly if that makes sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny  help is welcome :) I have
  been looking at mostly Google Fonts because I'm using WordPress but would be willing
  to look into other options if I knew how. \r\n"

    many have climbed Everest) and see if there's a font lying around at the top?\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe just use a really expensive font, 'cause very few will have bought it? Or
    perhaps an ugly one because most will pass it by?\r\n\r\nAnd she should do this
    because you mean if she picks the right font, she doesn't have to write anything
    at all on the blog, the important part is already done?\r\n\r\nIn short, I'm confused
    how this advise helps."

  body: "It's pretty simple. A font isn't just about readability, it expresses things;
    and what it expresses depends not only on what it looks like, but also what it's
    been used for. A great example is Trajan: one might expect it to convey Ancient
    Rome, but it really mostly makes people think of Hollywood movie posters, Victoria's
    Secret, etc. It's much worse with Helvetica: it has said so much about so many
    things that it no longer says anything. Neither of those typefaces are free. On
    the other hand it's not rocket science that something that costs more than something
    else is generally more rare, hence generally more focused. Exceptions? Duh.\r\n\r\nBut
    deep down you already know all this. It's that the chip on your shoulder has gotten
    so big it's affecting your hearing.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And she should do this
    because you mean if she picks the right font, she doesn't have to write anything
    at all on the blog, the important part is already done?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm
    not stupid enough to have said that. And you're not stupid enough to believe I
    said that. On the other hand thinking that this place needs to be about more than
    just typography is stupid.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    often does, but is not guaranteed to.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to suggest [[http://www.studiodilena.it/|Studio
    Di Lena]] as font supplier, my beady eye leaning on Nova Semplicit\xE0 and Lello.
    IIRC, they only cost a name drop."

  body: "Your logo is basically handwriting or, in the pre-Y2K days \"signage,\" so
    the real question is whether you want to continue that theme, or use something
    that really does suggest \"type,\" with all its traditional regularity.\r\n\r\nThe
    one thought I had was the logo is, as you say, a touch edgy. Alegreya is a touch
    edgy, esp. in the bold, but likely too pretty for your use. So, I just Googled
    edgy fonts...\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=edgy+fonts&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=Phs0U5GNCPTHsASBz4C4BA&sqi=2&ved=0CCUQsAQ&biw=1169&bih=682\r\n\r\nWith
