  with designing a new logo for our company. The company is currently called National
  Polytunnels and has a logo. The logo etc wansn't designed by myself and I personally
  hate them. The good news is that the company has moved in new directions (pitched
  roof buildings and canpopies for Garden centres and the retail industry). The old
  logo and company name doesnt cut it anymore and after lots of meeting with the MD
  he has now agreed that I can have a go at designing a new logo based on the name
  National Structures.\r\n\r\nI have been playing around with Ideas for some time
  and have listed the things that I need ed to look at to get me started.\r\n\r\n1.
  What is the main buisiness core / Manufacture & instalation of steel framed buildings.\r\n2.
  How do they acheive this / Initial site visit and structure design, steelwork and
  material manufacture, construction on site.\r\n3. Target group / Garden centre's,
  retail industry, schools etc\r\n\r\nThe MD also wants to move away from the old
  style altogether and has said \"start with a clean sheet\"\r\n\r\nHere is the old
  logo for National Polytunnels. I added the word Structures to it for recent advertising
  just to try and feed the name in a little. The original logo was done by the MD.\r\n\r\nAs
  I have a blank canvas I am struggling to get started as there are so many options
  here. Any suggestions??"

    building and the finished product, take pictures.\r\nLook at competitor\u2019s
    logos (to see what has already been done). \r\nSketch out ideas on paper and refine
    them. \r\nDoes it have to include an image, will type do the job better on its
    own? \r\nLook at colours.\r\nLook at structures, natural or manufactured, that
    provide covering. \r\nDefine what you don\u2019t like about the old logo.\r\nDefine
    what you want a new logo to do, where it should go (stationery, vehicle livery,
    boards etc).\r\n\r\nThese are in no particular order, the key is to define your
    aim and reduce/refine your options.\r\n\r\nTim"
