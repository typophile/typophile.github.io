  body: "Why indeed! A valid question. But not one much different from \"Why isn't
    all education free?*\". \r\n\r\nBut on a more practical level the reason is that
    we have basic costs that we have to cover. Students get a discount because we
    believe in that and because of the donation of space and resources the University
    gives us. AIGA and ATypI members get a discount too albeit not so deep. We want
    to support them too. \r\n\r\nI suspect that there is also the question of self-selection.
    The students we have had have been amazing. They have been very motivated. If
    Crafting Type was free they may have been less focused. The idealist in me is
    not excited by the way that this works as a psychological factor. However like
    it or not, it clearly a very real factor. Oddly enough it was a student that told
    me this was true for them which is how I started to think about it.\r\n\r\nIf
    someone would like to give Crafting Type an endowment to allow travel etc and
    we could easily be a not for profit. Our status is a default rather than a necessary
    state. But as things stand now we have to come out slightly ahead to be able to
    keep doing this. In this way we are a bit like TypeCon or ATypI despite the difference
    in status and stature. We all have to keep slightly ahead or stop holding events.
    \r\n\r\nCrafting Type helps students gain insight into how hard it is to make
    a nice typeface and how wonderful a nice typeface can really be and why. We also
    do the type industry in general favors because we put names and faces to the makers
    of type so that student realize that real people make type and if they license
    a type it is a meaningful thing. We explain what EULAs are and why the license
    status of a typeface matters. Dave myself and Vern will also sometimes vary and
    disagree with each other in class about these issues and design issues to encourage
    students to make up their own minds. \r\n\r\nThere is one very big difference:
    we don't plan for this to happen once a year or even three times but rather much
    more often. Expect to see Crafting Type anywhere people want it to arrive.\r\n\r\n*I
    think it should ideally be free but as a society you have to rearrange your priorities
    and accept the loss of privilege for some for that to happen. I am all for that.
    A level playing field is the best way for merit to rise."

    agree that it can't be free (unless as you say philanthropy somehow kicks in).
    And hopefully <em>everybody</em> in your team can appreciate that sort of thing...
    Because otherwise I'm tempted to expect that a student can take you guys home
    afterwards and make you keep teaching him type design for free...  ;-)\r\n\r\nBTW,
    do you guys know about this?\r\nhttp://thepublicschool.org/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    typeface design workshop in your city, let's chat!</b>\r\n\r\nIf you want to be
    a guest instructor,  let's chat!\r\n\r\n> But why isn't it free? ;-)\r\n\r\nIt
    is as cheap as we could possibly make it, and it is non-profit; its even financially
    administrated by a official 501c3 non-profit :-)\r\n\r\nIf someone really wants
    to attend and can't afford it, we should chat, and the CT team will try to figure
    something out :-)\r\n\r\nps. Its Saturday/Sunday/Monday Feb 2-3-4 :)"

  body: That's good value! We end up running the workshops like 12 hours a day because
    we're nuts, so its quite comparable in terms of tutoring hours available - but
    running a course over a long time like that gives everyone a lot of homework time
