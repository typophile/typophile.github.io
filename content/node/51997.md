body: "I've been working on a continuous line typeface with the geometry of a geometric
  sans. I like the flow of Morice produced by Letterbox, so I wonder if the glyphs
  I have constructed so far are too stiff. I'm not sure my characters follow a good
  standard of proportions. I wonder how difficult lowercase, numerals and special
  characters will be. I'm having a hard time envisioning how lowercase are going to
  work at this point (except for maybe a lowercase b and d - they\r\ncould be based
  off of the P). Thanks in advance for your feedback.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick overview
  of my current concerns with each of the glyphs:\r\n\r\nA - Is the crossbar too low?
  \r\nB - Does the lower bowl protrude too little or too much?\r\nC - This is one
  of the few glyphs without a overlap. Do you think that\r\nbreaks the system too
  much? I know that Cs, Os and other rounded glyphs\r\nextend above the cap height
  and below the baseline a little, but I'm not\r\nsure how far to extend them.\r\nD
  - I'm not sure if the curves are constructed ideally.\r\nE - This was the first
  glyph I constructed on the computer. I'm not sure\r\nif the crossbar extends too
  far or too little. \r\nF - Same concern with the F as the E. Should the F be based
  off of the\r\nE?\r\nG - I wonder if the top of the G is too flat. Should the G relate
  more\r\nto the C? Or should the C relate more to the G?\r\nH - Is the height of
  the crossbar too centered?\r\nI - Should the I have an overlap?\r\nJ - Does the
  J get too flat and geometric at the bottom?\r\nK - The join around the crossbar
  seems kind of stiff\r\nL - Should there be more contrast between the vertical and
  horizontal\r\nstrokes\r\nM - The M gets kind of messy and challenging. I wonder
  if a sideways E\r\nwould be a good place to start?\r\nN - Should I figure out the
  N before the M?\r\nO - I wonder if I need some sort of overlap. \r\nP - This is
  probably my favorite glyph. The P was the initial glyph that\r\nI sketched. I wonder
  if the transition between the horizontal lines and\r\nthe curves are too abrupt.\r\nQ
  - This character just doesn't quite sit well with me. I would prefer\r\nit be constructed
  as one continuous line. \r\nR - Not sure I placed the right leg in the right spot.
  \r\nT - I kind of just guessed on the width of the T. \r\nU - I prefer to have an
  overlap of some sort. I wonder if the transition\r\nbetween the vertical lines and
  the curves are too abrupt.\r\nV - I am kind of bothered by the open bottom portion
  of the V. \r\nW - Two Vs don't seem to create a very good W. I'm not sure where
  to\r\nplace the intersection. \r\nX - I haven't tried an X yet\r\nY - The Y isn't
  a perfect continuous line. I feel the same way about the\r\nY that I do about the
  Q. There must be a better solution. \r\nZ - The Z doesn't really fit with the other
  glyphs. I'd like to explore some more options. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is great.\r\n\r\nA: no.\r\nB: no.\r\nC: I think no overlap is fine on
    some glyphs. Don't want to be too dogmatic with the gimmick. see Y.\r\nD: they
    look fine to me.\r\nE, F: crossbar is perfect.\r\nG: the flat top is fine, but
    don't use one that flat on the C. The C could be a bit more open, though.\r\nH:
    B, E, F, H, K, P and R should have the same crossbar height. Otherwise strings
    of text will look weird when those letters are next to each other.\r\nI: a few
    with no overlap is fine, see C.\r\nJ: no, it looks good.\r\nK: no, it looks good.\r\nL:
    no. Dude, the font looks good. Don't second guess every single letter. :)\r\nM,
    N: Start from what you did with the V. Do them together... try different things
    until you find something that looks right.\r\nO, Q: The first thing I noticed
    was not the lack of overlap in the C and the I but the fact that the O and Q are
    the only two glyphs with more than one continuous line. I think the O *should*
    have overlap... maybe at the top, or in the upper left, make the inside and outside
    strokes switch position.  The Q should have a similar switch but incorporated
    into the crossbar. These are the two most problematic glyphs.\r\nP: it's rad.
    \r\nR: The diagonal foot should match the K, which it does. Looks good.\r\nS:
    Do you have something against S? Like the O, I think the S should have an overlap,
    maybe in the center. \r\nT: Width looks good.\r\nU: I think this one is ok without
    an overlap too. The bowl should match the bottom half of the O. \r\nV: Don't be
    bothered. It looks good. Copy it for the M and N. \r\nW: I say copy the V, with
    more vertical diagonals. Or copy the M when you design it. \r\nX: This one's going
    to be tough. :)\r\nY: This looks bad. I think the Y could get away without any
    overlap, like the way the diagonals of the K come together. Or you could make
    it more lowercase looking, where the right diagonal descends in a straight line
    all the way to the bottom of the glyph.  Then you could do an overlap like the
    one in the A.\r\nZ: If you keep the V and make the M, N and W to match then the
    Z will fit just fine. \r\n\r\nThe lowercase b, d, p and q definitely should not
    just match the P. They should be more like a vertical with a lowercase o attached.
    \r\n\r\nIf you're stuck on some of the glyphs you might go and design the numbers.
    Doing a few more glyphs might get you more familiar with the pattern of the face
    and make the remaining letters more straightforward. \r\n\r\nThat's my $0.02,
    take it all with a grain of salt. Post another PDF when you get further, I'd like
    to see it.\r\n\r\n-matt"

  body: "Y is a three-way intersection, so it should be able to work just like the
    better glyphs. I'd say fold the upper right arm from a gap in the lower left.
    Also, the arms as you've designed it are rather thin.\r\n\r\nZ might look better
    if you keep the top fold but remove the bottom one, squaring that corner.\r\n\r\nFor
    my other suggestions, well, forgive me if I just draw them rather than try to
    put them into words.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qx_4141.png]"

  body: Thanks Matt, Kevin and Bob for the feedback. I have added a few more characters.
    I still need to figure out a solution for the N and Q. I decided to round the
    corners to help facilitate the flow of the continuous line. I wonder if the V
    and Z are too angular. I think the Y is probably too narrow and maybe a few glyphs
    are too tall. What do you think of having the M and W as mirror images? I'm looking
    forward to your feedback. The new PDF is added to the first post. Thanks, TY

  body: "I much prefer the right-angled corners of the first version, so I still like
    the V and Z. The M and W are great, and the X and Y much improved too. I'd like
    to see them, along with the previous version, with right-angled ends. \r\n\r\nI
    think the C and S should only have one cross-over... keep the cross-over at the
    tops. And the extra cross at the top of the G is overkill. \r\n\r\nI prefer the
    weird overlap in the J and G of the first version -- the second version's overlaps
    feel more formulaic and have less personality. \r\n"
