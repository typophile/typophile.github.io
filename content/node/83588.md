  body: This naive geometric look seems to be the new zeitgeist, of which Planeta
    and LL Brown are the hottest at the moment. (The latter way better). Also check
    Emmanuel Rey's upcoming Euclid! Neuzeit Grotesk is also in the same vein. Detail-wise,
    neither of these match though.

  body: "Right! forgot about Colophon. Thank You\r\nLL Brown is nice, the ITC Johnston
    root is pretty strong I find...\r\nBeen waiting for Euclid for a while :) But
    the thing is, these types of faces are so particular and trendy at the moment,
    that when they get released, we already have seen too much of it... Still interesting,
    but ehh... It's like the bright web blue overprint!\r\n"
