    guess to expand on my question, in determining which quality fonts to use with
    @font-face on pages while staying within the bounds of legality, is it fair to
    assume that hosting a copy on your own server for this usage counts as redistribution?"

    the patents were on the bytecode interpreter for TT hints. I.e., on the rendering,

    right, but when you're buying something, you have some rights as a customer, e.g.
    to get a product that's not faulty.\r\n\r\n<em>The problem is, outside of FontSpring,
    I know of no other online vendor who has adopted the practice of providing in-browser

    usefulness of a real webfont preview. If a customer looks at it with an uncritical
    browser (for example he looks at an unhinted font which looks fine on Mac OS X),
    that may lead to wrong impressions & decisions. Or the customer would have to
    be knowledgeable enough about the whole rendering issue to look at the specimens
    using various browsers, even different operating systems and font smoothing settings.\r\n\r\nFor
    the rendering issue, I like Typekit's screenshot preview function, though it has
    its flaws in its current implementation (it doesn't mention different user settings

    rendering, it is not evident.  <strong>Above </strong>the user-selected threshold
