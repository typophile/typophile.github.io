  body: "Blayne,\r\n\r\nI think you need to get farther away from Helvetica to really
    make your small pages readable. Helvetica has the disadvantages of very closed
    letters, very static, similar forms, and very tight spacing. Overall it works
    better at sizes above 12. For a hymnal I suggest something more humane, open spaced,
    and comfortable. Good candidates:\r\n\r\nEva, Fresco or Versa from [[http://www.ourtype.be/|Ourtype,]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_clifford_six_roman/|Clifford

    Serif]]\r\n\r\nor, if you have a lavish budget, [[http://www.teff.nl/fonts/lexicon/index.html|Lexicon,]]
    with short or long descenders. \r\n\r\nEach of these suggestions has several qualities
    that can help you. They are all economical because they are low-contrast, have
    large x-heights, are slightly condensed, are very clear and crisp, or possibly
    all these. Since point size is completely relative in type (10 looks like 7 in
    another face), you have to adjust the size of your type until it hits the sweet
    spot where it's clearly readable, yet still conserving space. This is something
    only your eyes can tell you. So you might be able to set Stone Serif or Albertina
    at 8 point, but you might have to set Lexicon or Columbus at 10 for the same clarity
    and comfort. \r\n\r\nNotice also that I have suggested both serif and sans faces.
    There are several sans faces that present ideal clarity at small sizes, and several
    serif faces that also perform at these small sizes (5, 6, 7 point). Not all serif
    faces, nor all sans faces can do this job. Generally, the typeface has to be designed
    specifically for that purpose in order to perform well. \r\n\r\nIn any case, getting
    away from the unfortunate qualities of Helvetica will be an advantage. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Crossgrove - Brilliant.  Once I get the time I'll go through all your suggestions
    and sample them... Beautiful stuff.  One of them... can't remember now looks like
    it would compliment the font I'm using for the title text: iona regular - a celticky
    font.\r\n\r\nJohn - Clifford seems like a good candidate... Good to know you're
    using it in a similar fashion... Though when matching text to music, sometimes
    (most-times!) you don't have the luxury of evenly spaced words... so we'll see.\r\n\r\nSpire...
    I suppose I'm not totally \"set\" but that was my initial gut.  Some of the suggestions
    above may pull me in the serif direction though ;)  \r\n\r\nWork flow question
    in terms of sampling all of these fonts... One nice thing about veer.com is that
    they have a lightbox where you can sample... I could not find the same feature
    at fonts.com, etc...  Just curious if I'm missing something here... I suppose
    I could take screen shots and line them up in photoshop or such... just wondering
    your expert thoughts on that.\r\n\r\nAll the best guys... and thanks for the needed
    advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Many of the foundries have a type tester or preview tool. Everyone calls
    it something different, from \"try me!\" to \"letter setter\", or sometimes it's
    just part of the sample pages like on fontshop.com (\"generate sample\"). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    not as many foundries offer PDFs with small text, which would help you more in
    deciding. It's nearly impossible to get a sense of a font's performance in small
    sizes from a 42-point screen image. \r\n\r\nTwo I forgot: [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/garagefonts/freight_text_medium/|Freight

    for a better idea. \r\n\r\nGenerally you can find PDFs and other testing tools
    if you snoop around. I understand if you need to set aside time for that. \r\n\r\nI

  body: "A response from a friend of mine who's a musical engraver:\r\n\r\n\"I think
    I have to agree with some of the responses to your post on the typophile forum.
    A low contrast serif font will read much easier at small point sizes. I am a huge
    fan of sans serif fonts but after working with a guy who studied typography religiously,
    I came to really appreciate the font designers (of legitimate fonts) and the care
    they put into making a particular font work for specific uses.\r\n\r\nI have always
    liked Stone ITC as someone mentioned. The serifs have a smaller softer profile
    which makes it seem more like a sans font. Myriad Condensed is also a nice font--as
    someone else mentioned. I think I would go for the serif font though for a more
    professional printed look. Just my two cents though.\"\r\n\r\nThought I'd include
    it here for the sake of this thread.  Thanks for all your help... I'm going through
    and testing most of the fonts mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    scarcely make it out, especially in typically murky church lighting. For me (and
    perhaps many other users), the labor of reading words and music at the same time
    makes legibility a paramount concern -- please, please run some tests in unfavorable
    conditions with bleary-eyed older users, to make sure your project (however handsome
    it may be in bright light, to youthful eyes) doesn't end up unusable to a large
    proportion of the congregation.

    across Chaparral Pro.  I really like the look of it, a bit casual for a serif
    which I like.  When I compare it to other hymnbooks it does look slightly thinner
    which could be just the laser printer I'm using... Would it be tacky to use the
    semibold variant?  The semibold is then a bit thicker than the hymnbooks I'm referencing
    but then again it might perform well on old eyes???  of course it all depends
    I know and without you all seeing the finished product it's hard to say...\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the question should be... Would Semibold be ok as main lyric text or do folks
    mostly use semibold for items that you would otherwise bold such as perhaps a
    title but didn't want the heavy full bold... \r\n\r\nThis has kinda turned into
