  body: "Hi Tomi,\r\n\r\nYou seem to be a machine.\r\n\r\nI like what I can see, it
    would be nice if you provide a bigger view of italics, however I think they look
    great, I love \"Th\" and \"Q\". The \"is\" ligature is beyond the line for me,
    it doesn't look very clean and helpful.\r\n\r\nMaybe you didn't ask, but I suggest
    to correct the condensed effect on the thinnest weights.\r\n\r\nNice job!!!\r\n\r\nSergio"

  body: "I would call this Italic \"Cursive\", make a more sedate Italics (at the
    same inclination) and use the Cursive for emphasis in a body of the Italic (or
    even for nested emphasis).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi-\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nThose are in fact Swash Italics;
    basic italics are pretty standard. They are still a work in progress, and I'm
    giving them hiatus for a day or two, while I finish my version of Kabel (I named
    that Kaapeli)."

  body: "There is a huge variation of the letter structure between thin and extra-bold
    version, where bold are wider than thin, or the x-height is changing between the
    versions. There is any idea or concept behind that?\r\nTry to equal the x-height
    (or make it preety similar) and check what happen with the type.\r\n\r\nIn any
    other way it's very interesting."

  body: The e and o get too dark as you go to bold. I think that compressing and expanding
    the width is something to be done in another set of fonts ideally speaking. Still
    you are showing quite a bit of promise with this.

  body: "Thank for the comments, Andr\xE9s and Eben-\r\n\r\nTanner is a study of serif
    type for me. I'm also working on Caslon-style. But this design is one that is
    just natural to me. Basically I just started making glyphs, and see what they'd
    look like. I went back and forth a bit, and evenutually got the book weight.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9s;
    with this amount of change in weight, I could keep the weights and widths closer
    together, but I don't want to make a condensed/extended family. Any suggestions
    how to do that?\r\n\r\nEben: 'a' gets too dark as well. And I'm not happy with
    the colour of 'e' and 'o' either.\r\n\r\nWith sans serif it's enough to draw three
    weights: the thinnest, book, and the heaviest. With serif this method no longer
    applies. I have to figure out how to work this out."

  body: "The problem with varying the width that much between weights is that it causes
    a large shift in the character of the typeface. A user who finds a lighter weight
    suitable for a job is unlikely to find a darker weight suitable for the same job.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "just a beginner but:\r\n\r\nthe diagonal-contrast of the \"semi-bold\" is
    a little bigger than the others, non?!\r\ni mean the proportional rate(anyway
    in comparison to \"bold\" and light\").\r\nlook at the \"o\".\r\n\r\nand in my
    opinion the serifs between \"n\"/\"m\" look bizzare,\r\nbecause they realy tight
    in comparison to the rest \"white-room\"(?).\r\nanother detail: the right serif
    of the last stem of the bold \"m\".\r\nneedn't it to be highter than the left
    serif of the \"i\" (or)\r\nthe the serifs of \"i\" should be \"more open\".\r\n\r\nbut
    the last two points also can be a result of my LCD."
