  birth defects, there are options to correct the malformation. A birth defect is
  nothing to be ashamed of, but if you are uncomfortable wearing it around every day
  or are self-conscious, surgery is an opportunity to feel better about your appearance.
  While some birth defects are easier to correct than others, plastic surgery is definitely
  something to consider. Research plastic surgery today to see what doctors can do
  for you.<p><p>\r\n\r\nCleft Lips<p><p>\r\n\r\nCleft lips or palettes are mouth deformations.
  The most common contribution to cleft lips is premature birth, as an early baby
  does not have time to complete the formation process of the face in the womb. Cleft
  lips can be subtle and require little to no outside help, or they can be sizable
  and very noticeable. For these deformations, plastic surgeons offer a way to cover
  up or reconstruct the lip to make it look more normal. You can <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/2g6st9/david_halpern_md/?already_submitted=true\">surgeons

  anywhere in the head and face area, giving a lump to the affected person. The tumors
  are benign, but they can cause much strife when it comes to looking and feeling
  appealing other people. To fix these tumors, doctors remove the tumor and use skin
  to cover and patch up the affected area. Facial tumors may take multiple surgeries
  to completely correct.<p><p>\r\n\r\nAsymmetrical Lines<p><p>\r\n\r\nFace aesthetics
  all comes down to symmetry. An asymmetrical face consists of one side being higher
  or lower than the other, giving an abnormal look. This kind of surgery is more extensive
  may require the breaking of facial bones in order to reconstruct a more even face.
  Healing takes awhile, but it is worth it for those who suffer from public ridicule
  or lack of self-confidence.<p><p>\r\n\r\nEar Malformations<p><p>\r\n\r\nEar malformations
  are more common than you might think. Ears can either be slightly damaged or significantly
  altered. Plastic surgery offers a means of correction by using skin from other parts
  of the body or face to stretch and smooth out the ear. Some ears are easily covered
  by hair or with makeup, but other deformations require more than a quick fix.<p><p>\r\n\r\nBirth
  defects occur while in the womb and your problems with various defects can be helped
  by plastic surgeons. Beauty comes from within, but it is still important to feel
  confident in yourself. Take the time to look at surgery and the benefits you gain
  from it. You can discover more here by contacting Tampa Bay Plastic Surgery Inc
