  body: The main title could be a custom logo... And yet I have the feeling that I've
    seen these lettershapes before... (Some of these shapes are reminiscent of <a
    href="http://www.p22.com/products/albers.html">Josef Albers' typeface work</a>,
    but that's not it, either.)Sorry, I know my comment isn't very helpful. If I can
    remember where I've seen it before, I'll post it.

  body: I bet the main title has been custom drawn, as it is easy enough to do in
    Illustrator. I have done something similar constructed for a <a href="http://www.allaboutseb.net/archives/132"
    target="_blank">danish music company</a> once.

    maybe it's his own style.\r\n\r\nITC Barcelona is a beauty, and it's cheap !\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help.\r\n\r\n+"

  body: I've taken a look at all his work on his site & haven't come across the same
    face anywhere. What I did come across were the logo's for Event Horizon & Where
    To Start which are somewhat similar in style & -according to me- obviously custom.
    If anything, I'm even more convinced now that it's custom, but you could always
    contact him to find out...

    a custom design. \"Matt Coyle\" is indeed set in ITC Barcelona.\r\n\r\nI've written
