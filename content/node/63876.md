  example.\r\n\r\nI have one myriad pro name and the different weights in the pulldown
  so there is only one name for the family and then the different styles are a in
  the pulldown to the right of the name.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand my font klavika,
  gotham, futura and a few others all have their different weights split up into different
  fonts. So instead of it saying Futura and then having the weights on the right each
  weight bold, light, ect. has their own name.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I could take
  those fonts like that and some how make photoshop recognize them as a family and
  not different fonts?\r\n\r\nI posted this in general too I will remove that one."

    me crazy too. IIRC it is a font naming issue.

    deal with this issue by having about 25 folders of different classifications of
    fonts, which I move in and out of the Font Library folder, depending on the project."
