  body: 'I personally like it simple. DIN is okay, but it is enough of DIN on the
    streets here in Germany. My recent clients were happy enough with Stone Sans offered
    to be their corporate type. My favs are Stone, Legacy, Ocean, Scala, Seria and
    Thesis. And I hope these kind of typefaces will get there credit some time soon.
    <BR> <BR>As for &#34;next DIN&#34; - and I might be too late for this - but Gill
    Sans is quite popular these days. Way too popular, I think. I&#39;ve written about
    it in Russian @<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/ru_typography/152045.html">ru_typography</a>,
    but there are links to scans, so you might see what I mean. Gill is really everywhere
    here. I&#39;ve been reading an article right now, set in Gill. A german article.
    And there is a spare room to rent across the street and guess what '

    and well done, I love &#39;em. As for the next DIN, who knows, Amplitude by Mr.
    Schwartz?

    to use them?

  body: isn&#39;t that hypocritcal, then, to encourage others to use yours? you should
    encourage them to build their own to drool over, doncha think?

    let me know. I just think there is an awful lot of &#34;talk&#34; about type on
    this forum, I just want everyone to not only talk about it, but license it, use
    it, and by all means create it yourself. <BR> <BR>In fact if everyone was busy
    creating their own fonts, they would have scant time to spend discussing what
    to drool over. '

  body: I haven&#39;t bought them, no. That&#39;s only because I haven&#39;t had a
    job that could use them. I just enjoy studying type that has been designed well.
    It helps me further my type design skills in general.  <BR> <BR>If you go to my
    website, you&#39;ll see that I&#39;m working on plenty of new fonts and have even
    more on my computer that may never see the light of day. <BR> <BR>I just enjoy
    talking type, that&#39;s all.

  body: Same here - communication is human. And I don&#39;t think Typophile&#39;s
    content is just idle banter. Plus I start wondering why James is here. I hope
    he doesn&#39;t just leave one day, but if he sticks around I hope it will be mostly
    to communicate. Drool or dry. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: i apologize for my previous rudeness, james. i just thought that the purpose
    of typophile was for fellow aficionado/as to come together and discuss whatever
    aspect of type is on his/her mind. personally, i wish i could get my corp to purchase
    Miller Daily for use in our news publication, but they&#39;re tight, so i hafta
    be content with drooling. i guess i COULD design my own newspaper face, but i
    doubt it&#39;d be an improvement over times even. but it&#39;s good to know i
    can consider you as a resource, i&#39;ll keep that in mind if i ever turn the
    talk into action.

  body: I see no rudeness. I was only trying to encourage you to act on your drooling
    and license the fonts you desired. I do understand the limitations of budgets,
    but font software is such a relatively inexpensive item in the scheme of business
    expenses... I guess its seeing too much of the same boring type around the city
    everyday that makes me a little cranky.
