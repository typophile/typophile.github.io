  I have a client with some mispelled words and I have access to Acrobat Pro?\r\n\r\nAlso;
  can you cut and paste text from a word document with various tabs and paragraph
  settings and keep the settings when pasted in Quark?"

    should just be able to highlight the text and start typing. of course you will
    need the same fonts that were used in the original document..."

  body: It's not quite as simple as that. You need to go to Tools / Advanced Editing
    and select the  TouchUp Text Tool. Then you'll be able to make edits.

    like crap. Or am I wrong?

  body: I don't think you can do changes to the text unless you have the typeface
    on your system. I could be wrong about this, but it seems a client of mine tried
    to edit something once and he couldn't.

  body: 'I think what it all adds up to is: print pdf:s should can be altered just
    as metal-plates could be messed up before digital printing (with knives and swords
    and 5000000000 bucks a second). Why the hell would anyone alter printable pdf''s?
    Get your editing in line, i''d say.'

  body: Opening the pdf in Illustrator and making the changes there works, too. I
    have better experiences in pdf changes with Illustrator than with Acrobat pro.
    with Acrobat the text sometimes doesn't quite behave like it should.

  body: "The problem with editing is line and character breaks.  In AI, you often
    get chunks of letters in groups that make no sense. I would drag select all the
    text you wish to edit with the pointer tool; then switch to the text insertion
    tool and drag a box, then paste.  You then get all the text together but usually
    need to add word breaks where there were line breaks.  Sound like a pain in the
    tuchous? You bettcha.  That is why it is better to make changes in the originating
    application unless you are in dire straights.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "When importing from Word to Quark rather than cut and paste, if you import
    the text using command e, it will keep it's formatting, and if it was created
    on a Mac and you have the same font it will import at the same sizes and font,
    however every text document will need close attention lookout for double wordspaces,
    incorrect quote marks and apostrophes, en dashes, tabs, ellipsis etc. The typographer's
    checklist thread will give you further investigations. For the pdf justified text
    will occasionally alter ranging \u2013 if possible I would ask the client to provide
    the artwork or do the chnages and resend the document \u2013 safer in the long
    run.\r\nTim"
