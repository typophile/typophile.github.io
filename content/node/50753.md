body: Well i am creating a magazine, and i'd lke to know what the name of this typeface
  is. or if you know of similar typefaces that are sans serifs and kind of round based.
  Please let me know i'd appreciate it. the magazine is about Graphic design and Architecture,
  so tyou can clearly see why i'd like a font with these characteristics.
