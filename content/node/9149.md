body: Christo&#39;s The Gates is being installed in Central Park in Manhattan. If
  you can go to see it, its a must see. 23 miles of walking paths covered by the 7500
  orange gates. They are about 15 feet tall and 7 1/2 feet wide and on Feb 12th they
  unleash the mesh tops. That will take over 2 hours. I rode my bike today and saw
  about 1000 of the gates errected and its magnificent. It will be up for 16 days
  and there is a trolley to get around the park and see the whole installation. Of
  course the best way is by bike and with a camera. If you visit Central Park Concervancy
  you will find links to The Gates

    to The Gates. Not only did Cristo and Jean Claude pay for the project themselves,
    but all the proceeds from tee shirt sales and posters will be donated to the Central
    Park Conservancy.

  body: John, it took a fork lift just to move one of those bases. We had a 6&#34;
    snow storm when they were putting down the bases and it gave the fork lifts a
    hard time. Those gates are going nowhere. They were so well designed, they took
    in account snow and wind too! As for vandalism they are being better protected
    by the police than the president.

  body: The rumor about the gates is two fold. One is Mayor Bloomberg actually paid
    for the installation and the second is each gate will be sold. All 7500 of them.  I
    will guess these artistic New Yorkers living in SoHo will have plenty of funds
    for their next art project. But you have to see it live if you can. Its now 90%
    up and it is amazing. Come, enjoy and be inspired!

    it was meant to be diplayed, but it&#39;s an interesting site to see these bright
    swatches during drab February.  <BR> <BR>The length of the cloth bothers me. They
    are like knee length skirts or pants that are just a little too short.

  body: The Gates are at there best when the winds pick up and they flow in breeze.  In
    the bright sun they change color depending on the angle you look at them. There
    is also an interesting employment situation. There are paid employees who have
    poles with a tennis ball at the end of them to untangle a gate if the wind blows
    it over the bar. Plus these employees give tips and directions to the visitors.

  body: As Chris noted every piece of The Gates is slated to be recycled. They have
    a plan for the fabric and the steel and whatever that &#40;one ton per base&#41;
    base material is. The recycling isn&#39;t generic it has specific purposes. I
    guess when you have 26 years you&#39;ve put into a project you sweat out every
    detail. The future videos and books will be very interesting.
