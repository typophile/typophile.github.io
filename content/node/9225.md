  <BR> <BR>been on this for too long once again. the initials actually go inside a
  crest. but I&#39;m having problems &#40;more-so with the client&#41;  <BR> <BR>so
  its O.D.F eh. they want script fonts or cursive something or other. I started with
  Legacy. - they said it wasn&#39;t ledgible. &#40;Its an abbrev. inside a crest where
  the entire organization name is going to be printed underneath on their forms...for
  crying out loud.&#41; but its not ledgible they say...and some member got a creative
  hat on and found Shelley on his PC, passed it around and now their set on it. I
  refused - especially with their layout of it &#40;diagonal decending scale of character
  overlaped and everything - I refrained from a freak out where I would have screamed
  about ledgibility. t h e y are telling m e this is more ledgible!? but I see its
  that old problem. whatever is on the PC operating system is ledgible. So, in a panic
  moment realizing they were about to reck my crest, I said I&#39;d try something
  more &#34;Shelley&#34; to go in the crest - but after my merge of Legacy and Shelley-esque
  features its all gone wrong. <BR> <BR>can it be salvaged? do you see any potential?
  there&#39;s something about the finishes that&#39;s just not consistant. suggestions
  would be helpful. thanks <BR>'

  body: Without seeing the design in context it is hard to make a judgement.     <BR>    <BR>Out
    of the three I like the one to the far right.    <BR>    <BR>From what you have
    given thus far I would say that you may be trying to force the symmetry to much.
    Mainly I see a problem with the &#34;F&#34;. It looks like an &#34;S&#34; to me.
    If indeed it is an &#34;F&#34; it looks too much like a lower case &#34;f&#34;.  It
    should be as important as the &#34;O&#34; and the &#34;D&#34;.   <BR>    <BR>The
    second one looks arabic, the dots are too much for me and the first, I think reaches
    &#40;sorry&#41; illegibility.    <BR>    <BR>Clients can be &#40;are&#41; a bitch.    <BR>    <BR>-smc

    go right with <BR>it. but i do agree that the f needs some <BR>work. mainly to
    make it look like an <BR>uppercase rather than lower. <BR> <BR>if you&#39;re feeling
    daring, ask them why they <BR>felt the need to hire you if they could do <BR>it
    themselves in the first place. they just <BR>might agree that they don&#39;t need
    you, but <BR>you can always just bill them for the work <BR>so far. and please
    give them a message from me: <BR>any of the first samples are better than the

  body: I think that is funny that people think that 3-D is more &#34;professional&#34;
    or  finished&#34;. Every client should have access to Kai&#39;s Power Tools. Just
    Kidding. That would be lame. <BR> <BR>Perhaps it is too late, or your just plain
    done with it, but I think that the black type on the red could be lacking contrast.
    I don&#39;t have my Pantone book here so I could be wrong. But I have used black
    and this color before. <BR> <BR>I think knocking the &#34;ODF&#34; out, like the
    bottom one, might have a bit more punch. And I was wondering how it might look
    without the black frame. I guess what I am describing would be the bottom one-
    but red. <BR> <BR>Anyway, guess we  can&#39;t expect every client to see with
    the same set of eyes that we see with. Over all, designing and getting paid for
    it keeps me happy and I hope it does you. If you think about it, we get paid to
    draw. What more could you ask? <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: seanmicheal - good points. If I recover from bout of anger I&#39;ll try implementing
    your suggestions.  There&#39;s a lot of mistakes in here still and while I had
    thought this was going to be a great opportunity where I could submit it here
    there and everywhere...&#40;well really when don&#39;t I start thinking of all
    the greatness any project could be&#41; its all been crushed &amp; comprimised.
    <BR> <BR>to your second point though - I could transform this into a moral, ethical
    discussion about design....but suffice to say that I don&#39;t think our job is
    so easy to say we get paid to draw anymore then an architect gets paid to play
    with toothpicks. but I get your drift and it made me happy for a few. <BR> <BR>is
    that D so Disney or what. ahhhhh maybe I shouldn&#39;t look at it anymore

  body: I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t ask for a design  referencing the letters
    in a dressage ring &#40;if I had a project like this, the cliche would prove irresistible&#41;...
    given the geometry of dressage tests and the use of the letters set around a ring
    as &#34;guide posts,&#34; this could&#39;ve been such fun. <BR> <BR>Sorry about
    the difficult client...

    something that the general public could understand in order to get attendance.
    Plus something prestigious enough considering they are courting Mercedes for sponsorship.
