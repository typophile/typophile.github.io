  body: Yeah, just zoom out till it&#39;s 100, type 100 in the box, use the pull down
    and click &#34;actual size&#34;, etc.

  body: No, I meant making a PDF that is always shown at 100% and the viewing user
    isn&#39;t allowed to change that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I think the short answer is no, <BR>If that&#39;s what you want, why not just
    supply a bitmap?

  body: '&#62; why not just supply a bitmap? <BR> <BR>The point is in fact to use
    a bitmap font &#40;actually, a grayscale pixelfont&#41; in PDF. <BR>It seems that
    supplying a raw bitmap is asking for viewing &#40;and printing&#42;&#41; trouble.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Although printing a pixelfont is a last resort type of thing. <BR>

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a way round this, but not foolproof. You could
    set the &#39;open options&#39; &#40;file &#62; document properties &#62; open
    options&#41; to make the file open at full screen mode, at 100%. Set the permission
    as viewing only. Then every time the file is opened it will display the way you
    intended. But of course the users can always get out of the full screen mode and
    do whatever they want with it... Putting navigation on the actual pages would
    help, I guess, making the PDF a self-contained &#39;application&#39;.

  body: I think the best way would be to simply make it a greyscale bitmap at a specified
    resolution. Then any further zooming past a certain point would be ineffective.
    <BR> <BR>If one was concerned about size of the PDF, it is technically possible
    to use a bitmap Type 3 font in PDF. Don&#39;t ask me how one would easily force
    this to happen, though! <BR> <BR>T <BR>T
