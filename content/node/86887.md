  </a>. Since then, I have completely re-drawn it. At this point, it has little more
  than a passing resemblance to the Fontstruct font, but there is a line in  font
  info that reads, \"Sample\tFontStruct is a trademark of FSI FontShop International
  GmbH\" and which originated with the Fontstruct version and which I can not figure
  out how to get rid of. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny advice on that?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n"
