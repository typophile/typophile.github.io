  body: "David, any question can be considered on various levels. This particular
    question does make sense on a certain level. Think for example of a low-res bitmap
    font, or an abstract futuristic design. In some cases I can see the monocular
    /g and the /9 being distinguished only by the former having a sharp top-right
    and the latter a soft one.\r\n\r\nBTW, I handwrite my /9 with a top-right stub,
    and many people misread it as a \"g\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@Hrant: If we relied on your definition of lower case g and the difference
    between it and the number 9 the world would stop turning. Wonderful Hrant, I don't
    know what I would have done if I had remained on those hot coals burning my pretty
    flesh.\"In some cases I can see the monocular /g and the /9 being distinguished
    only by the former having a sharp top-right and the latter a soft one.\" If that's
    all you can offer as an example it makes me wonder how small your brain is. What
    about the curving tail of a 9 contrasted with the straight back stem of a single
    story g? A competent type designer would have mentioned that. Low res bitmap fonts
    and futurist abstract fonts don't count for diddley poo. How often do they get
    used?\r\n\r\n@Ryan: the number 9 is typically drawn with a huge great oculus or
    bowl, whereas lower case g is drawn with a smaller bowl and larger stem and tail
    in proportion. The biggest giveaway is context. Who puts a number nine in the
    middle of words in place of lower case g's? Only a moron would do that. The 2
    glyphs are distinguished by context, okay honey? The letters to the left and the
    right define them as g's. Let's look at an example. \"Aggravated assault\" Lookee
    yar, Ryan Maelhorn wonders if the 2 glyphs after \"A\" are g's or number 9's.
    Ryan, when you type the word \"aggravated\", do you put nines in there instead
    of g's? You know the answers to all of these questions already, and you are only
    here asking typophile to get attention. If you're going to be a typographer I
    would expect you to see these basic truths as self-evident, with no need to ask
    what the difference is. But you allow your silly ego to get in the way of common
    sense. Happy happy, joy joy."

  body: Actually, the most common difference is that in lining figures, /9/ is placed
    higher than /g/. And isn't old-style figures really a source of confusion between
    /9/ and single-story /g/?

    remember that 1995 film with Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in it?
    I think it was called <strong>Se7en</strong>. Everyone seemed to \"get it\" at
    the time despite the juxtaposition of letters and numbers and, although I have
    a bit of a jaded view about marketing types, I am fairly sure they weren't <em>all</em>
    morons."

  body: "Does not compute.\r\n\r\nHere's how I roll: a (mono) /g is a blob with something
    coming down the right half, shifting leftward (so it's not a /q). A /9 is a blob
    with something coming down, preferably not left of center (even center is fine).
    If you're going to mix alphabetics and numerics (like in a username, password
    or TinyURL, so not crazy) then you want a singularity on the blob of the /g, preferably
    towards the top-right. BTW, [mis]alignment does not qualitatively disambiguate.\r\n\r\nAlfred

  body: "I think the differences so far mentioned here are valid ones, even if they
    don't apply to all typefaces:\r\n\r\n- the right side of the 9 is usually a single
    curve, while that of the g is usually a straight line which is has curved parts
    at top and bottom;\r\n\r\n- the straight line at the right of the g is attached
    to a circle, and so extends upwards past the point of contact, while the 9 is
    basically a single line with a spiral-like shape;\r\n\r\n- the bottom of the 9
    continues pointing downwards until the end, while that of the g forms a bowl that
    turns back up;\r\n\r\n- the 9 stands on the baseline in the more common ranging
    numbers, while the g always has a descender."
