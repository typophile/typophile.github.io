body: Hi could I please get some feed back on my logo. It is for a cafe. It is targeted
  towards a young alternative market. The food is reasonably priced, and concentrates
  on flavour and experimentation. We encourage a friendly laid back atmosphere, with
  regular gigs and bands.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36010.jpg"

  body: just wondering is the &#39;o&#39; meant to look like an eight-ball? apart
    from that i think i would like to see a version of the logo with the &#39;a&#39;
    and the &#39;s&#39; at a size that is in between the &#39;k&#39; and the &#39;o.&#39;
    <BR>hope this helps a little bit.

  body: I like the raw nature of the logo, but keep in mind one practical idea. Don&#39;t
    lock your self into having the graphic that is so vertical. There may be applications
    where its not practical. I&#39;m not saying loose it, what I&#39;m saying is have
    an alternative if the need arises. Your next post should show us some color ideas.

  body: I don&#39;t think the squareness of Eurostile goes with the flowing lines
    in the rest of your logo. I&#39;d look for a more rounded font for &#34;Caf

    <BR> <BR>It was probally misleading adding the line. While it is a strong part
    of the identity it is not directly part of the logo. Im still not sure about the
    font for cafe.'

  body: Morgan, I like both of them but the new one almost looks like an eye which
    might be cool because of the name.

  body: Your showing some nice ideas, but you still haven&#39;t resolved the underwelming
    size of the O.  <BR> <BR>You isolated the O with color and it now reads as &#34;KAS&#34;
    with a blue symbol in the middle. <BR> <BR>Is it a Cafe and Bar? It used to be
    just a cafe. <BR>Must&#39;ve found some extra money in the budget. <BR> <BR>At
    initial glance, that S could be a snake. But I fear too much would be going on
    in the logo then. <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: Andrew, what I like about what he has done is it reminds me of the late 60&#39;s
    Pyschedelic, groovy feel. Only thing missing is the the funky 60&#39;s colors.

  body: Dan, do you see the pyschadelic feeling being lost if he made the O a lil
    more proportionate to the other letters? <BR> <BR>I dont. Lets say he made the
    O 50% bigger and not blue, i think its an improvement <BR> <BR>And what is a bigger
    problem in logo development than reading the name wrong? <BR> <BR>I think the
    style is great. It just needs some tinkering.

  body: I agree with you Andrew, based on most of these student logos this one might
    be the freshest. As for Cafe &amp; Bar try your own handwriting. Loose the cute
    blue
