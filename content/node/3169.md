  body: Sorry Jim, It thought this was a joke-y thread, I haven&#39;t any idea about
    this font. <BR>Justin has, though. Tiki Surf it is <BR> <BR>But it&#39;s funny
    that you think of chinese food when you see it and Hrant thinks of dogs, the two
    aren&#39;t that far apart...

  body: Sorry buddy but it says nothing along the lines of foodles or chinese takeaways
    for me either. Why did you pick that style of letterform? It couldn&#39;t be further
    removed from being chinese related in my mind. Also why should it appear raised
    / shiny? Stylistically speaking, I&#39;m impressed with how you&#39;ve given the
    type dimension. I&#39;ve noted it ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Also... not wishing to twist
    the knife... but considering the style of letterforms and the &#39;sparkly&#39;
    look, I sware I keep seeing &#39;chintzy&#39; ;&#41;
