  body: "I think you are caught in the 'hand-printed font dilemma', which means there
    are too many fonts like this to easily find a particular one. Your best bet is
    to look for one that seems similar in feeling to you and use that instead. One
    place to see a wide selection (which tells you where they came from) is the <a
    href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html\">Script Font ID Guide, Part
    11</a>, and another place would be the free handwriting fonts at www.dafont.com.\r\n\r\n-
