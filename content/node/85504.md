  body: I like that. It doesn't appear to be one of their fonts but it has qualities
    of their caps-only [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/patagon/|Patagon]].
    I doubt a foundry would use another foundry's font for their logo so I think this
    is custom lettering. It reminds me of the heavier weights of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/tang/|Tang]]
    from Suomi.
