  name (\"Aldabra\") on its aircraft. I couldn't find a better image of the font.
  So far I have figured out that it's not Vivaldi.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind
  regards,\r\nChristian"

    but yu are right it's Vivaldi.\r\n\r\nWhat a start for me ... Big Pardon! :-/\r\n\r\nChristian"
