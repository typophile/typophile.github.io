  extra ampersands in the Poetica family - of which there seem to be too many for
  my feeble brain - and just wondered - what's everyone's favourite ampersand? Is
  it the most beautiful? Functional? Unobtrusive? Personally (Poetica aside) I must
  be a sole defender of Rotis here in saying I quite like that face's one.\r\n\r\nsimon"

  body: "There's nothing wrong with the ampersand in Rotis, unless winding back the
    clock and de-atrophicizing atrophied letterforms by restoring them to their form
    of origin can be considered a crime. Probably because they look fancy, a lot of
    typographers evidently prefer the more familiar atrophied ampersand form to its
    ancestor ligature. \r\n\r\nAmpersand started out as a ligature of E and t, and
    was progressively twisted, flowed, redesigned into what I term an \"atrophied\"
    letterform.\r\n\r\nVerdana's ampersand takes the same route as Rotis': a cursive
    capital <strong>E</strong> wedded to a <strong>t</strong> spells \"Et\", ancient
    Latin for \"and\". \r\n\r\nMost of the fonts I have made contain the much older
    ligature form. One unreleased work has a selection of four, two of them using
    a lower case <strong>e</strong>, one of which is caps-height. Yes, of course it's
    easier to draw than the other kind of ampersand. But it's much more honest and
    less time-mottled.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
