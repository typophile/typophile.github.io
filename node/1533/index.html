The &quot;f&quot; bugs me (the descender shouldn't do that), and the &quot;p&quot; looks like it's running for cover, but otherwise I think you have a winner. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But what about the caps? Allow me to make a suggestion: don't try to make the conventional Roman cap structures work; instead, look to the uncial tradition.

		<div class="commentbody">Brian! So glad to see you're back.

Balance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I think the upright quality of this design is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what makes it great. You lost that with the new 'd'. But the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new 'p' is better - the original being off-balance. The 'g'  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->leans a bit too much to the right as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Good work moving the 't' crossbar to the x-height. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I thought Christopher's ideas on the 'y' and 'w' were  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good. Maybe just move the left v stroke of the 'w' to the left  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a tad. He might be right about the 'r' too, but I can't tell <!-- raw HTML omitted -->without a text setting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Caps.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Your best uppercasers are the simple ones: 'V', <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'w', 'A', 'Q'. Don't touch those. I think there's too much going  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on in the 'N', 'T', 'F', 'C'. The Tim Burton curl isn't working  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for me and it belies the smooth, calligraphic nature of the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->face. The ornate 'O' might work as an alternate, but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->simple stressed oval is just fine I have no idea what to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with the 'E'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5.

It just seems to uptight to me, especially next to the with the P and the R.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The T I thought looked great in the word &quot;Tulip&quot;, but on the first page I have trouble recognizing it (and only then by process of elimination). Perhaps if the horizontal stroke extended a little further to the right? Or perhaps if the vertical stroke curved in the opposite direction it would be more recognizable by evoking the shape of a lowercase t.</div>

I've moved the horizontal stroke over a bit. Does that help? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just noticed that, looking at the B and E, the overshoot on the bottom of the B doesn't feel at all right.
