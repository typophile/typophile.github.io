<p>edit: This project has come a long way since I started sharing it with the community here. As it nears completion, at least in this weight and style, I need just a little more advice to turn that last corner. Eben Sorkin has been an immense help, far greater than I have a right to expect from any one person who I am not paying. The constructive advice of other experts (and I know you&rsquo;re hiding around here somewhere) would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Here is yet another project I abandoned long ago. I&rsquo;m trying to retrace my steps to how I created it and why I gave it that name. It looks more like a slightly circusy wood type with some modern attributes than anything Macedonian.</p>
<p>Indeed, it needs a lot of work yet. My initial output is what Fontographer expells as an EPS of all characters, which for some reason breaks some of the points apart so I can&rsquo;t apply a fill without tediously fixing everything.</p>
<p>I welcome any and all suggestions and comments, including on finding a new, more appropriately evocative name for the thing.</p>

<p>-The &lsquo;S&rsquo; and &rsquo;s' bug me. The contrast is really wonky.
-Why are some serifs flat, and others curved?
-'&amp;' looks like an &lsquo;8&rsquo;
-I dig the ball terminal on the &lsquo;4&rsquo; and some other letters. I wonder if this could be incorporated into other characters.
-I think &lsquo;C&rsquo; needs a spur.
-&lsquo;G&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t really fit. The bottom is too thin, and it could use a spur also.
-&lsquo;T&rsquo; is off-putting. Maybe the curves on top should go the other way to better match the other characters.
-&lsquo;k&rsquo; looks very poorly constructed.
-The bottom of the &rsquo;t' is cut off abruptly - it works though. Maybe introduce this into other letters as well.</p>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s got a nice feel, but it&rsquo;s a little inconsistent. With some refinement and redrawing, this could be a very nice display face.</p>

<p>Have a look at other typefaces, don&rsquo;t copy them, but see why they work, how the weight is distributed, how the proportions are, etc.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Sebastian. I&rsquo;ll get on to those fixes you suggest.
6 and 9 always give me trouble.</p>
<p>Though sometimes I sketch out  few letters, I tend to design my fonts in Fontographer from the beginning, usually starting with &ldquo;h&rdquo;, &ldquo;V' and &ldquo;O&rdquo; then hashing out the basic forms by collaging components from  them to the rest of the characters before fine tuning the shapes. This leads to all the mistakes you noted, but they&rsquo;ll eventually get worked out. It also makes it relatively easy to rapidly construct the special characters that, I agree, really would be better left for later.</p>
<p>What do you think of my other projects here: Palormak and Cartmeign in this subforum, and Triangulor in the experimental section?</p>

I would encourage you to reconsider each character &amp; see how you could make them differfently. I get the feeling that some of them were made based on others to a too great a degree. I think your 4 works well desite it&rsquo;s oddity. Your 5 and 2 as well. The two is a little unballanced. The 3 is struggling. Perhaps one  arc should be bigger than the other or a historical form with an arbitary straight line should be used. The 8 too. It needs direction. Keep at it.</div>

<p>OK, it&rsquo;s been a while, but here I am with another go at it (again with a PDF #6 for closer inspection).</p>
<p>There are a lot of changes here, some obvious, some subtle. Try and find them all!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It looks like it&rsquo;s gelling up better. Still here is what I am thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cap X looks like it needs to pee.</li>
<li>I think that if you look at some wood type you would find a model for putting the detail &amp; charcater you have across without compromising the face quite so much. In particular, I am thinking that the serif wiggle you have in  some glyphs like cap E seem just right  whereas the lc m seems like a victim of imposed rules. I would start making some exceptions &amp; let the m off. Some of the Serifs seem to be hiding out. They make their glyph look like a wall flower. wheras the 2 seems at ease with itself and the 5 is qite outgoing. The 4 is not keeping up. It&rsquo;s just too many excentric details in one glyph - 4 of them! Help that 9! Above all I would ask myself - what gets better with the wiggle? What gets worse?</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you keep going! I still like the excentricity overall and I think it could become surprisingly readable. I really like the &lsquo;e&rsquo;. Make the others play nice with it.</p>

How would you suggest I change it? I don&rsquo;t want it to end up merely as a rotated 6 (I&rsquo;m still not happy with the 6).</p>
<p>I am working on something new for the 4. I&rsquo;ve eliminated the curve on the diagonal and flattened the horizontal crossbar a bit. That will be up with the next installment</p>
<p>About the wiggles, I find a certain amount of this enhances readability. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s having that effect here, but in my earlier font <a href="http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2205">Gohan</a>, the vertical wiggle almost makes it suitable as a microfont, in spite of its heavy weight and rounded shapes. Of course there are some details on that which need further refinement too. That font has a pretty odd 4 too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Definitely take my suggestion with a grain of salt ( or more ) my assumptions about what you want the font to do may not be correct. What if the overall shape of the 6 was more like the 9 ( digonal-ish) but it was tapered or had a small teardop.</p>
<p>Not quite like this but</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dwr.com/images/thumbnails/tn_9774.gif">http://www.dwr.com/images/thumbnails/tn_9774.gif</a></p>
<p>Actually. I am noticing now that you have an re-opening taper on the 2, A huge one on the Ampersand, a ball on the 4, r &amp; g, x z, and then there is the finish on the s. Anyway. I don&rsquo;t think you shouyld be doctrinare about this but looking at finnishing strokes I am seeing more variety than is maybe ideal.</p>
<p>Also, looking at the xyz I seem to see 3 different ideas about how to manage diagonal widths. The y suggesdt that stroke variation will be low. The x suggests it will be high. The z is quite light. Looking at the e and g, both of which seem right for some reason, I think I see the weight I would have the xy&amp;z adopt.</p>
<p>I am looking foreward to seeing the new 4. I agree that the wiggles add to the face in general. Did what I was saying about woodtype make any sense to you?</p>

<p>about the changes - I like the increased consistancy but the stroke contrast in the digonals seems a bit harsh. Especially on the y &amp; cap V. I like the new six but I wonder if it wouldn&rsquo;t be better flipped for a new 9. What if the 6 had a longer ascending arm? I think you need to give the Q&rsquo;s bottom stoke a bit more weight to carry it off. But it&rsquo;s a fun idea.The e has to gain some weight to match or the others have to loose a little.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah, it looks like I got the contrast on the y backwards too.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that many of the caps are too narrow. They look all condensed while the lc looks all fat, even though the stroke widths are nearly the same. Also the O isn&rsquo;t obviously different from the zero. Handling this problem would mean quite an overhaul, though. Any idea how I should go about that?</p>
<p>There is something about the 9 that I really like. I know you keep telling me to change it, and I agree it is a bit strange, but it works for me.</p>
<p>What do you think of the new 4?</p>
<p>The 3 does have an odd finish, but that&rsquo;s meant to make for a good &lt;3 emoticon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I love the italic <cite>g</cite> from Galliard, but I wouldn&rsquo;t put it in my Cyril. Just because a glyph is good doesn&rsquo;t mean it fits. The 9 is interesting, but I don&rsquo;t think it works here. I also question the motive behind the 3: to make a good emoticon? Which will people use more often: the 3 or the emoticon? If you really want to be able to have a good heart, just draw a picture of one and stick it somewhere in the font.
If something looks wrong, don&rsquo;t hesitate to fix it, even if it does mean &ldquo;quite an overhaul&rdquo;. In your case, it actually won&rsquo;t take a whole lot to just widen the caps that need widening, like OGHCDB. Make them all look consistent with each other. Giving them similar amounts of white space is a good place to start. (This feels a bit weird, because I can remember when I was on the other end of this exact same critique with <a href=http://typophile.com/node/12860>Cyril</a>. In my case, the font was totally not what I had meant to draw the first time, so I redrew it, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really necessary here.) The new 4 strikes me as better, but I think I prefer the old 6. The 1 needs more character.</div>

<p>The most significant changes this time around are the punctuation and accents. All that was square is round now.</p>
<p>Also, B, f, fi, fl, and Florin have changed.</p>
<p>Ohm and Delta are the characters not showing in the PDF, resulting in the error message. I haven&rsquo;t a clue why yet. Version 9 is up top, and it works but for those two. I just need to figure out how to get the rest of the characters in there. Canvas 8 doesn&rsquo;t have the character pallette to input them with.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Here are some ideas to keep you busy:  Pull the nose of the 2 in slightly. ( Maybe)  Give it more overshoot on top. The tops of the eights &amp; nines seem to thick maybe. The left side of the 7 seems to light/weak. The curve on the lc k could be more weighty/exuberant. I can&rsquo;t find a way to love the flat r - why not lower the join of the n &amp; m &amp; make an r that matches? Why not throw in the p while your at it? ( it might be better like the b) What about a loop at the beginning of the Q&rsquo;s tail instead of a reverse. That might be more &lsquo;ballsy&rsquo;. heh heh ( rolling of eyes obligatory ). But more meaninfully it would create a more &lsquo;even&rsquo; feeling in the weights. The Q is too light now. In the case of your font I think a flat side to the inside of the O in OE might be better. Why does the l &amp; t drop their bottom? I am not diggin' it. How does that go with the rest? I like the lc v but the lc w &amp; y still don&rsquo;t quite sing to me. The left bottom of the lc z needs more weight somehow. It feels lopsided. The ae seems too wide &amp; lumpy to me. The UC W could be wider. Why not? It&rsquo;s such an exumberant face in general why not give it some room? What about dropping the Join on the UC Y? It seems a bit cramped with those big serifs. I would add mnore weight back to the CAp S in the middle. I don&rsquo;t lknow if the UC T needs to be quite so wide. The N needs some air &amp; width ( a bit ) - The C needs more space &amp; a more gracelful left curve. The G too. Even more, actually. The serif on the UC M makes it look like it&rsquo;s sad. Your best glyphs have a a hardy readdy to do anything feeling about them. The UC A has it. TheB,R,g,s,o &amp; V too. Get that spirit in the rest.  The $ is not wide enogh at the bese especially the left side. British Pound sign - same thing.</div>

Only things I see right now are:
The indent on the leg of the cap R, it catches the eye, since only that char and the lc &lsquo;k&rsquo; have it. Not that it looks bad, but it sticks out a bit maybe.
And the circumflex, which is a bit square / pointed and straight-lined, compared to the other characters. If you know what I mean.</div>

The acute is a simple H-flip of the grave, and the asterisk points are rotated copies of the top one. I suspect some artifact crept in there when I added points at extrema and aligned points to grid, and possibly even in the output to TrueType, but I think it is more likely a flaw in Acrobat rendering. I&rsquo;m also noticing a vertical stretch overall in the PDF compared to how the forms appear in my graphics programs.</div>

<p>For some reason Fog&rsquo;s export to PS1 fonts is glitchy (which is why I&rsquo;m making as TrueType. OTF isn&rsquo;t even an option), at least when i comes to installing them&ndash; the space gets all stretched out, but returns to normal after purging caches with Linotype Font Explorer. I&rsquo;m not sure exacly where the problem lies, apart from the fact that I need a new compuer and software updates and I can&rsquo;t afford any of it right now.</p>
<p>Once I get it done, I might try making a PS font from Fontographer then converting that to OTF with FontForge, but I don&rsquo;t want to geet ahead of myself just yet.</p>

You should also be aware that FOG doesn&rsquo;t work in whole numbers. It uses fractions.

<p>I&rsquo;ll give a shot at some layouts. I&rsquo;m not really sure what a good use for this is right now. It calls attentiont itself a bit too much for body text, and is a bit bold for that anyway. I might come up with a lighter weight version once this is nailed down and see how it works. Maybe with slightly looser spacing it work for advertising copy.

But you should look at your b I have it match the new letters a bit more. Or make the others match the b. Or something else but getting them all on the same path. Speaking of which &hellip; Maybe think about that p too. It&rsquo;s an odd man out. All of this is a big deal beacause you will gain in legibility going some ways but I know you wanteded your own solution. I would keep trying things.</p>
<p>Similarly I think you can make a case for keeping the g &amp; q with the structure they have. I think you might want to bring the d in line with them to some greater degree. the g is looking abit too closed right now. Almost like an odd 8. I like the opening on the y - even though it&rsquo;s got the same structure the opical difference is huge. Optics are what count.</p>
<p>RE; the cap Q I think you can make it work ( maybe) by adding weight to the bottom of the curve before it loops. You might have to drop the tail slightly to do that. But I bet that would work. I like the Q. I want it to work.</p>
<p>The top of the 3 feels off balance - maybe it&rsquo;s too heavy. The 8 feels denser &amp; darker that the other #s. Maybe open it up a bit.</p>

Looking at the font actually used to set text, it looks pretty good now. A good quirky feel. I maintain that the Q is too much. I think that (along with the Q) your most distracting characters right now are g,u, and maybe a. The u should probably have a different serif scheme&ndash;no other letters have a similar one. I&rsquo;m thinking top serifs perhaps like Weiss, or maybe just as though taken from a rotated Agamemnon n. And the g will probably be okay once you square it out like I suggested. Oh, also x is a bit wide. Next sample post a pangram or two so we can see the whole thing in action!</div>

<p>Looking at these characters in several other fonts, I can find no consistency to this rule. Hoefler Text has both at standard cap height, in Helvetica they both drop their bottoms to the decender height, in Chicago they both go below the baseline, but not that deep, and in Courier they extend both above the cap height and below to decender level. If there is one correct way, then three of these fonts must be wrong!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In what way is the d not in line with the g and q? When I started, at least, the a, b, d, p, and q were all derived from each other through rotating, flipping, removing the stem, &amp;c, as was the g with the addition of the hook decender. in fact, the h, n, and m were in this family too, just with their bases opened. I went with the 2 story a because the earlier æ wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently distinct from the œ. Apart from that, are you suggesting I revert to the original shapes, or that I replicate the curve on the n to those letters that don&rsquo;t have it yet?
I thought the blended serif-curve ripple was an identifying characteristic of this font. Is that worth eliminating? It seems that would be removing a cohesive relationship rather than adding one.</p>
<p>Damn, that sounds plaintive. I&rsquo;m just trying to understand the thoughts you&rsquo;re contributing. Most likely it&rsquo;s a matter of my lack of experience and limited vocabulary that I&rsquo;m just not getting it. I truly value and welcome your advice, and I hope to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I may be trying to hold you to a higher or simply different standard than you are interested in. Which may well be unfair. But, I think this face might actually sell with more of the kinks worked out. (You should get other folks opinions on that)</p>
<p>But that makes me think: what sells more? Display or text? &lsquo;Text&rsquo; is answer. And the closer to a text face a display face is ( &amp; this is a display face) so that you can use it for pull quotes &amp; stuff the better it will sell. So the suggestions I have been making have been geared towards making the face a bit more suitable for text. If thats not your thing- no problem.</p>
<p>So. Assuming you could be interested in the text thing: About the b h n : One of the features that help identify a b h or n is  the notch where the leg joins. If you look at the face FF dax you see an alternative solution. But conventionally speaking, and your face has some of it&rsquo;s roots in convention, there is usually a notch.</p>
<p>About rotating &amp; mirroring: Conventionally the q should not mirror the p. The d aught not to mirror the b. Sure they do in some faces like DIN. But it is a 20th century affectation having to do with modernist reductivism. I don&rsquo;t see that focus in your type. There are many other alternatives but first let&rsquo;s look at the traditional one:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/sansaslabsample_4107.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>These are from Sansa Slab (Ourtype). See how the forms differ? Look at d the q! I see the d &amp; q as a more vaiable place for your wave. Maybe the r too. Maybe not though. I would maybe make it more narrow. Maybe a different kind of wave aught be available for the b h &amp; n. So I think you should retain your ripple but think about ways to integrate &amp; vary it with the greater diversity of forms found in text faces. Applying &lsquo;rules&rsquo; can backfire if it interferes with the distictiveness of a letter.</p>
<p>BTW - You are right to be concerned with cohesion, but there are many ways of achieving that. The wave was not enough. There is stem weight, optical weight matching, spacing repeated themes in the ornament, and the ends of strokes.</p>
<p>If you can clarify what you want from the face the choices are easier. For instance: if you plan on the face being used at 36pt and larger then your g with it&rsquo;s narrow opening may be okay. Looking at large text it doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all. But if you want people to be able to think of using this font at 12, 14, 16pt etc; then I would definitely open that thing up right away! Context helps. Keep thinking about your intended use &amp; the choices you make will be easier &amp; smarter. 100% of these suggestions are refutable in the right context.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It would be great if this could work as a text face. As it is, it&rsquo;s a bit too bold and tightly spaced, so I&rsquo;ll have to loosen it up and make a lighter weight version once it is fully nailed down. (To say nothing of corresponding italics. I&rsquo;ve never done those before.)</p>
<p>And, I have opened up the g in the next iteration quite a bit. I also increased the em square to 2048 (surprisingly painless).I&rsquo;m still poking around for other things to tweak. I should be ready to show those developments later today.</p>
<p>In the mean time, here is a sample to compare with your example of Sansa Slab, plus a few extra letters:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/agamemnon10-shortsample_6340.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In version 11ß, the bowl of the b will have a similar top to the archof the h,n, and m. but as I understand it, you&rsquo;re suggesting that follow on to the p as well, and also be reflected on the underside of the d, q, and maybe the g.</p>
<p>The wave I speak of is most clearly evident on the top of the r, but it is present on the top of the p, q, and g as the curve of the bowl flows into the serif, and similarly on the bases of the b and d. To apply your suggestion (in the manner that I&rsquo;m understanding it, which could be wrong) would wind up putting notches in the d and p that aren&rsquo;t there now. Am I getting this right?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You almost have me. What I am saying is that the glyphs which have bowl or arms that emerge from the left to right ( nmb&amp;p &amp; maybe r too ) will all benefit from being notched as in the Sansa example. Whereas the qd &amp; g all seem to take to the wave shape ( on the top ) more naturally. Looking at the b I see is has the wave on the bottom. So there is your connection still in place.</p>
<p>Assuming you agree that this is worth trying out I should add that the n &amp; m do have that 1st serif that make them semi cohesive already but the way the arms are coming out don&rsquo;t look quite right to me with the rest of the design. What if you used something more like the b&rsquo;s bowl top join. That feels more relaxed.</p>
<p>As for the r I would either give it a b like arm connection or alter the wave for that glyph. I realize that it was the concept glyph but I think it could be better. You could raise the height of the r&rsquo;s arm &amp; ball too. And or you could try to make the glyph less wide. It&rsquo;s creating an odd break in flow as it is. The a might be slightly less wide too.</p>

<p>It took me a little longer than I expected but there it is, version 11, including a lot of the changes we&rsquo;ve talked about. I do not like what&rsquo;s become of the r, and I&rsquo;ll likely revert back to the previous version.</p>

The decrease in size of the loop in the Q opens the shape up, good thing. The rest of the overall little changes are improvements, I think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think some of this is exactly right. The b p &amp; h now have a notch but they also look utterly natural. They fit right in. About the lc r. I agree it isn&rsquo;t working. Oddly enogh it looks you took both of the ideas I was suggesting for the r at once! I was thinking high or less wide. It&rsquo;s actually incredible cool to see both just from an interest point of view and I think you did a great job but I think one or the other is right way - especially now. I would try less wide and model it partly on the n. The g looks much more readable at small sizes. There rae still some letter relationship things left - like the am&amp;b all seem to be thinking about different x heights. Do you see what I mean? I think I like the a as the model for ideal height the best. What do you think?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The a is a bit taller than the rest of the lc, a side effect of swithching to the two-story design. but looking at it that is probably a better height to aim for with the rest of the letters. It will mean making adjustments to almost half the characters, but it should be worth it.</p>
<p>Jelmar, I think you could be seeing an illusion in the Q. The loop is larger, not smaller, than in the previous version, but there is an overlap in the loop that got rendered even-odd by Canvas exporting to PNG and needs to be made solid. It should render correctly in the PDF samples.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was looking at the PDF of pangrams and it struck me that when you are done with the next round of changes it might be most productive to start altering spacing and then maybe kerning.</p>
<p>I have been wondering what effect the rolling shapes would have when set into text. If for instance they would produce an unpleasant unevenness or if they would be colorful and attract the eye. Of course it&rsquo;s a little preliminary to say, but I think it&rsquo;s the later &amp; better of the two. Nice. I especially like the z. It&rsquo;s really doing it&rsquo;s job.</p>

<p>I solved one missing glyph problem (seems inherent to Canvas 8) but for some reason the lc y acute and multiply won&rsquo;t generate in the TrueType font, and I&rsquo;m having loads of problems when I output to PS1 format. A whole bunch of glyphs go missing and the space comes out four times too wide.</p>
<p>I might have to boot into OS9 and see if that solves the problem, though I dread having to do that.</p>
<p>PDFs seem to generate just fine from the print dialog in TextEdit, so I&rsquo;ll be using that for my character sample. I&rsquo;ll have to see if I have anything else that will do as well and allow a 2 cloumn layout for a text test.</p>

Loosened up the spacing a bit too and I think it&rsquo;s good, but the kerning pairs still need work. Any flaws you can cal my attention to would be appreciated.</p>

The other thing is you might want to search the Typo-L archives and typophile archives for similar problems that may have been solved already or create new threads on typophile with one specific problem per thread.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>About the lc : I can thing of two things to try : You could pull the upper arm back slightly &amp; see if you like that better at text size. OR you could add weight to it and move the spacing slightly further to accomodate it.</p>
<p>I think the e is fab. You could add a little weight to the bottom - not an issue at display size but it would make the text size work better. Maybe the s could benefit from some similar tratment above &amp; below - but be careful. Even small changes are a big deal!</p>
<p>I basically like your CG&amp; S. What issues do you see?</p>
<p>The main thing I am noticing at text size is that the X height portions of letters are maybe too contrasted with the overshoots. The w is dwarfed. The m &amp; n seem to jump. I don&rsquo;t think you have to match the usual text convention. But the &lsquo;deviancy&rsquo; could be softened.</p>
<p>BTW if all this seems too text centric the other thing you could do is go back &amp; make a display version! That would be an awesome pairing.</p>
<p>What about a ball terminal on the 2? The Pound Serling might be better with one too.</p>
<p>BTW I really like the german double s. Could I see it in use?</p>
<p>I think the euro is okay but it is a little light. What about a heavier initial mark on the right?</p>
<p>The Bar D ( Eth) &amp; Bar L have bars that are too heavy. The lc eth has the cross bar at too acute of an angle. and it is too far down. Have you seen this? &lt; a href=http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/index.htm&gt;(link) Thorn and eth: how to get them right</a></p>
<p>What is next to that Yen Sign? It seem interesting!</p>
<p>The infinity is pretty weird. What&rsquo;s the idea there?</p>
<p>What if the fi lig joined at the top rather than the bottom of the dot?</p>
<p>What precedent is there for a curl under the &lsquo;mu&rsquo; sign? That looks odd to me.</p>
<p>Apart from a funny feeling the sterling sign is going to fall over I think I like the Currency symbols. They seem to match the spirit of what your doing.</p>
<p>The Section symbol seems to belong in another font though. It&rsquo;s so quiet &amp; small. Maybe try making a new one from a Cap S. Ahve a look at some other fonts. Also it should be bigger and taller - that is the Height should be that of the Cap but it should descend to the depth of the lc g.</p>
<p>I saw a lc k like yours the other day on a font caled Olive Green Mono. It&rsquo;s on the italic. I suggest you have a look at it! It has a motion woth emulating.</p>

<img src="/images/old-images/Jasonchop_6508.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a personal logo of a sort. The father of my girlfriend at the time was a curator at the National Museum in Taiwan, and quite an accomplished ink painter and calligrapher himself, helped me with the design. I forget what it literally translates to, but it kind of sounds like &ldquo;Jason&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the first thing I ever literally carved in stone.</p>
<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve put it in the &ldquo;apple&rdquo; key space in my fonts. Maybe it&rsquo;s not right, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to put the Apple, inc. logo there either unless they&rsquo;re licensing the font.</p>
<p>The reverse curl of the mu is indeed rare (I&rsquo;ve usually seen them extend left and hang straight), but I have seen it in other fonts. I&rsquo;ll have to get back to you on which ones. 
Too many older fonts never even bothered with matching shapes for all these special characters and just substituted from whatever their basic serif or commercial pi font was. I hope that doesn&rsquo;t go on too much anymore.</p>
<p>I have read Briem&rsquo;s pages, but it looks like I&rsquo;m due for another review.</p>
<p>If the fi lig connected to the top of the dot instead of the bottom, the arch of the f would be much wider and more open. The hook of the regular f is very tight in comparison already. Is it wise to make them more dissimilar?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I was thinking with the infinity other than I did not want it to be a sideways eight.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask in a more general context (rather than specific to this font alone) but exactly what features differentiate a text and display face (and other optical size categories, if that&rsquo;s the right term) of the same weight?</p>

<p>Adobe Garamond
Bodoni
ITC Cheltenham
Souvenir
ITC Veljovic italic</p>
<p>What I noticed a lot more of, though, was the use of an italic mu in otherwise upright fonts, and quite frequently a mu from an alltogether different font, often without even regard to matching weights. These are from the big foundries like Adobe, Bitstream, URW, etc. Those that do have a matching mu often look like a u with a p descender snapped on the left upright, though about as often there is a lachrymal descender.</p>

<p>This is topic much discussed. There are ways of searching typophile - ( admitedly not all the search boxes work for me) but google can help. In general though it&rsquo;s things like x height being in a certain range and a a whole bevy of other tendencies. Really your face is never going to be used to set a novel or a whole story in a magazine even - so it will not be a text face per se. But it could be used for pull qotes and a whole range of other near text tasks now that it would not have been acceptable for before. Actually, do you agree it is better now - or not so much?</p>
<p>About the serifs- (CGS etc.) Your right about their needing to be different while maintaing consitancy. My adice to is to go look at the many &amp; in some cases contradictory things that have been done &amp; find a model which you think suits your font best &amp; try it. Alternatively - trust your eyes. Find what feels right. Try things.</p>
<p>I was looking at the mu in the new Arno Pro from adobe &amp; it actually kinda close to yours. It&rsquo;s basically down with a slight curve in &amp; then a ball-ish blob. It&rsquo;s less wild than yours if you see what I mean. But realated. It comes with the trial version of the latest Photoshop. Maybe it&rsquo;s in the font shops too. The bold 36pt has a weight kinda like yoyr too. Have a look if you want.</p>

I think the spur on the Euro mark is supposed to be angled, though, so I might have to alter that one some.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve calmed down the mu. It still has a curved stem but the descender ends in more of a blob than a hook.</p>
<p>I ought to have the new one up tonight, or maybe early tomorrow.</p>

Here is version 13 (associated PDFs up top as usual. randomtext shows ß, ð, and þ in use, though the passage is nonsense.)</p>
<p>In addition to the points touched upon earlier, I raised the lc serifs to the x-height, reversing the slopes on most of them. This results in some of the serifs being tapered, which I couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out how to match on the v, w, x, and y. Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter. At least there isn&rsquo;t that big jump between the serif and the humps of the m, &amp;c.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Overall I am finding the face really really pleasant. I especially like the k oe ae r s e h.</p>
<p>My opinion is not informed enough so take it with a grain of salt but I like the german double s too. Maybe ask a german speaker about that.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>But of course I found things that bugged me too. So here is what I noticed when I printed the pangram sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>on the second line &lsquo;funtidrk&rsquo; the ti seem to be clashing. It&rsquo;s a spacing kerning issue. But before you address that you might want to alter the  &rsquo;t' which looks odd &amp; a little weak compared to the robustness of the other glyphs. The ending that works for l is not strong enogh for the t</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with such a robust face the &lsquo;eth&rsquo; ( reverse italic looking d with a slash) will need to be ajusted the slash is still in danger of being swallowed by the bowl. Why not extend the height of the ascender to that of the h &amp; d?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am still finding the Cap M looks pidgeon toed. Can you alter those serifs at the bottom?  On a related note the serif in the upper right of the Cap N seems overlong to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the end of the question mark stroke ( near the dot) was just a bot lighter and perhaps had form more lik ethe end of the lc r I think it would be better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the lc u seems too wide. Try reversing that lc n perhaps. It needs to have that bite out of it too - like the nmr &amp; so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give the ! a shot, but I&rsquo;m not sure how much I can do with it.</p>
<p>I may be putting too much effort into making the thickness of the horizontals consistent. There is room for more variation. The t, f, g, and others will benefit.</p>
<p>All the letters with strong diagonals (e.g.: A, K, R, M, N, V, W, X, Y, Z, k, v, w, x, y, z) give me trouble. What am I doing right in some that can be applied to fix what is wrong with the others?</p>
<p>The u is not simply a rotation of the n. Is the difference in width causing further problems? Would the problems be resolved by matching the widths?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly certain the stems are of consistent width, but I will measure them again to make sure, Even then, some might be giving the illusion of being irregular and need adjustment to compensate.</p>
<p>You mention a couple pairs of letters (ll, el) I hadn&rsquo;t really given much thought to those or other pairs besides kerning. Should I make a contextual substitution for the el pair? I don&rsquo;t think I can do that in Fontographer. I haven&rsquo;t even begun to touch on learning the wonders of preparing OpenType fonts, and the only tool I have to do that with anyway is FontForge. I&rsquo;d like to get the basic letter shapes settled before trying the fancy stuff.</p>

<p>I could not agree more.</p>
<p>Do you have good relations with anybody else on the type board? Why not email some people you respect &amp; ask them if youcan email them a PDF?</p>
<p><cite> The u is not simply a rotation of the n. Is the difference in width causing further problems? Would the problems be resolved by matching the widths? </cite></p>
<p>You are right about the n &amp; u not just being rotated! But I think that your n rotated would be a better base from which to work out a corrected u than the one you have now. And you would be starting with a width &amp; stem weight that was matching.</p>
<p><cite> I’m fairly certain the stems are of consistent width, but I will measure them again to make sure, Even then, some might be giving the illusion of being irregular and need adjustment to compensate.</cite></p>
<p>That might be going on. Yeah.</p>
<p><cite> I’ll give the ! a shot, but I’m not sure how much I can do with it. </cite></p>
<p>If it was me I would narrow the beginning of the base of the stroke inward to create a contrasting weight - so that the top flares out in comparison. Have a look at other faces though &amp; see if any of them inspire.</p>
<p>About the diagonals. I have a couple of thoughts about that. One is that compared to the issues you have solved now these were more minor. It may be a good time to adress them now however. On some level I have been reticent to suggest changing these until I saw the effect of the other changes because the two aspects relate to each other and with one thing sorted out for the most part it&rsquo;s easier to se what to do about the next. I also had a sense from you (and I wasn&rsquo;t sure I disagreed) that some of the important character of the design might be caught up in these diagonals &amp; serifs.</p>
<p>But now that I see where we are I think that yes you could adjust things. To my mind the biggest blockage in getting the diagonals sorted is the serifs. Most of the glyphs have an unusual pidgeon toes look to my eye. I think that may be fine now and a source of color in the face but I think it may just bee too strong. The serif have a big impact on how the diagonals feel. Why not bring them in on the interior a little in some cases or center them more? I would try both &amp; see what you think. More centering could bring up letter spacing issues of course..</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s do this. Let&rsquo;s pick just 3 letters &amp; try a few things with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UC V let&rsquo;s try trimming the inside serif on the right side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the K let&rsquo;s try bringing the upper diagonal stroke back to the left a little. The join can occur higher up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of the lc x offset the lighter digonals by making the pitch or angle more vertical. You could also widen &amp; open the letter up a little by offsetting the heavy diagonals more too. You don&rsquo;t have to do that with the UC X because the glyph is less cramped with stuff going on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other ways of doing these things too. Look around try different things.</p>
<p>With diagonals the solutions are often one-off. A common approach or priciple might be shared across letters but the circumstances are often too unique for the &lsquo;solution&rsquo; to be common across more than one letter.</p>
<p>about the el: I didn&rsquo;t mean the e &amp; the l. sorry. It&rsquo;s jist that l &amp; 1 look alibe so I was sounding it out. All I meant was that with the base of the l having the shape it does I would be good if it overshot the baseline. You could also change the shape to be flat &amp; sit on the baseline. I am not suggesting either one is better. I just think the l floats as it is &amp; looks odd.</p>
<p>what don&rsquo;t you like about the lc z?</p>
<p><cite> I’d like to get the basic letter shapes settled before trying the fancy stuff. </cite></p>
<p>exactly. I agree.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There isn&rsquo;t a particular problem I&rsquo;m having with the z, but it, like the others I mention, has the diagonal stroke, which, by the function of the software&rsquo;s drawing tools, are a bit more difficult to adjust than the strictly vertical and horizontal lines and keep consistent angles and stroke widths, especially when they intersect another stroke. It isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> difficult, but it does involve some extra steps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks! I appreciate that. You have been good at taking my suggestions in too. About the muttering: I think it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Here is what I would do: If you have been on the board long enough to know who you respect here; tell them. Ask them for help. Be ready for harsh reality or praise. Whichever it is. It might also be that they don&rsquo;t have time or they don&rsquo;t think enough of the design to rate it. That would be the worst I suspect. But be ready.</p>
<p>The thing is, when you started this design looked pretty scary. Not that it was ugly. It just had a ton of unresolved aspects. It probably looked like too much work to wade into casually. Now though I think you have a shot. You have done much of the that work now. Your face is decidely quirky but it&rsquo;s getting more solid all the time. And quirky &amp; solid are a great combination I think.</p>
<p>And I do want other folks to have a look in. I think the font will benefit from that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think there is something worth keeping in this idea. And that there are several ways to find a way of doing that. The idea I have is that you could begin the stroke not inside the o but instead at the left of the loop. But that might be sucky. Try it &amp; find out. I would sketch it in pencil over &amp; over until you get what you want. And I would consider some more expected options too. Leave yourself open to the best solution. Have you contacted/email anybody on the board to ask about the font? I am glad it&rsquo;s giving you greater satisfaction. I have been told by people I trust that sometimes the best thing after an intense bout of development is to take a break &amp; work on something else to give your eyes &amp; brain a chance to freshen up. I am not saying that&rsquo;s what time it is - just that it&rsquo;s an option.</div>

<p>I am going to have a go at the entire set, by commenting on version 0.15&rsquo;s glyphs as they strike me. This may be too little or too much, but I can&rsquo;t tell before I start. No matter how I am phrasing it, I am not saying any are &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, but simply musing. Take any negativity as a mis-emphasis on my part. This face is already beautiful. Ignore most of what I say, please, as I will just write it all, including possibly incorrect or irrelevant details. I have looked at the prior versions only as they come up in the thread. My feedback will consider the designs in context to each other, not as simply standalone letters, but it is based on personal aesthetics, not tradition, which others here are sharper with. And I am assuming that it is targeting both versatile display use (med-large sizes, med-short passages) and decorative use (large sizes, shorter passages).</p>
<p>Regarding OT Alternate glyphs: I don&rsquo;t have Fontographer, nor have I even seen it in a long time, but I imagine you can create alternate glyphs, name them and assign them to whatever space you like. Does it support Unicode number addresses? If so, you can implement alternate sets, substitutions and such through VOLT, a free tool from MS. To make things simple for now I would just recommend adding any alternates you think are &ldquo;essential&rdquo; to some blank spots and ignore the functional aspects.</p>
<p>&ndash;
A:Where there is no accent, It seems that the top serif could have a curve like the top of many other letters. I see it being flattened to fit the accents like it is now, coexisting in the same face.</p>
<p>A w/accents: I love the proportions.</p>
<p>Accents acute/grave: It seems that the bottom curve could look more natural, giving it a less constructed look, and more aerodynamics.</p>
<p>C/G: I wonder why the vertical serif doesn&rsquo;t bend a hair right at the top</p>
<p>D w/bar: The left of the bar seems to disappear at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>E: is this a &ldquo;flagship glyph&rdquo; I love all of it.</p>
<p>J: I love the hook&rsquo;s termination.</p>
<p>L w/bar: this comes across as heavier at small sizes.</p>
<p>M: The serifs are&hellip; odd. It feels as if it is collapsing in on itself. I think the center of the serif&rsquo;s arc should be contained by the stroke, even if it is still slightly weighted inwards. But I think it would look fine with shorter top serifs and everything centered. Lots of options here.</p>
<p>N: I might tweak this if it were mine, depending on what, if anything, I did to the M. But pretty nice.</p>
<p>OE: The sidebearings for this appear to be tighter than the O&rsquo;s, but I bet they aren&rsquo;t. Probably an artifact created by it being darker. Even tho' I think the -E is the same size, it looks shorter than on the AE.</p>
<p>Q: The stroke connecting the inner loop to the underbar becomes thinner at small sizes. Possibly fixable by making where it intersects the bottom of the outer loop wider by a unit or two. Or just fiddling with hinting. Otherwise, fantastic design.</p>
<p>S: Would a semiserif like the &rsquo;s' look good, or silly? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>V/W/Y: The upper-right most serif seems to have an oddness like the &lsquo;M&rsquo; I think the &lsquo;X&rsquo; shows a more soothing arrangement. I realize the stroke has a different angle, but it is still possibly inspiring.</p>
<p>Thorn: The righthand side could be rounder, or the counter could be more like the &lsquo;P&rsquo;.</p>
<p>a: love it. It looks so flowing, yet it has that uniformity that makes tpye cool. should the top of the bowl be thinner at it&rsquo;s thinest part? I suck @ &lsquo;a&rsquo;, so just ignore me.</p>
<p>ae: at large sizes, the bottom of the join looks slightly heavier than needed. The righthand of the a-&rsquo;s counter could hook in, to mimic the naked &lsquo;e&rsquo; contour.</p>
<p>fi: Brilliant. pleasant, hip, general goodness. What about bringing the f&rsquo;s tip&rsquo;s approach in lower, more audaciously. Right now, it is  a surprisingly cool look, and fi ligs are show-off glyphs, no? I might try an acute, rotated abt. 45 clockwise or so as the merged dot.</p>
<p>fl: looks good, the top is fantastic.</p>
<p>i/^: I hate dealing with those. Some faces use a skinnier accent.</p>
<p>r: this has come a long ways. very practical, but the width of the counter does a great job of avoiding that rn=m effect, as you wanted.</p>
<p>ss lig: why does the long s look so much like a long s, but the short s looks quite different? Does this contribute? I know I just suggested getting wild with the &lsquo;fi&rsquo;, but in this lig, I feel that the part within the heart (the standard baseline-to-xheight) should flow like &ldquo;normal&rdquo; letters, for those languages where it is exactly that. Considering that, I personally tend to customize only the top connection.</p>
<p>v/w: These might look really neat with the same effect as the stroke in the &lsquo;y&rsquo;. The sound arrangement of the serifs might be a good model for the &lsquo;M&rsquo;.</p>
<p>y: There is an interesting optical illusion going on here. At very large sizes (several inches) the left diagonal appears constant width (I think it actually is). At medium and smaller sizes (3/4 inch and under)the stroke appears to taper towards the bottom. This may be caused by screen hinting, or has something to do with the serifs on 3 corners, but not the outside bottom one. Just something to consider, unless it is all in my mind.</p>
<p>Either way, this is one of my favorite lc&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>prime: where is it?</p>
<p>double prime: Interesting, in a good way.</p>
<p>Dot period/elipsis, etc.: This seems to feel heavier than the text. I think it would look funny if it was the size of the accents (which are great), but it might look a little more cohesive if they were a hair smaller. In the lorem ipsum, they also seem to sit a little low on the line, intermitantly. I think that must be a scaling artifact.</p>
<p>daggers: alternates with mirrored center strokes could be a great feature, in case users wanted them to match in either direction.</p>
<p>&amp;: Very cool. I love the arced serif on the right, and the grace of the diagonal stroke.</p>
<p>@: the very end of the hoop seems like it could have a flaring, like the c/e, but that might be a dumb idea, too. :)</p>
<p>Numerals: A third numeral with a ball terminal could compliment the 2 and 4.</p>
<p>Superiors: The horizontals feel very light, especially as the face gets smaller. Not that they should math the regulars, but just a little more weight?</p>
<p>Superior 3: It looks different from the regular 3, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there is a purpose to that alteration. Is the regular 3 too noisy to condense?</p>
<p>fractions: the inf. 4 seems to sit differently in 1/4 and 3/4</p>
<p>Infinity: The &ldquo;two thin stems next to each other&rdquo; looks kinda forced, and without precedent elsewhere within the face. Additionally, it seems to kinda go against the spirit of the symbol, which is a continuum. I like the thick/thin/thick idea in general.</p>
<p>Delta: I love the horizontal that looks a lot like the face&rsquo;s serifs.</p>
<p>mu/micron: I don&rsquo;t care if this is in other faces or not. A real keeper. The beauty is wound well into making it more useful as a symbol, esp. at smaller sizes. Great job!</p>
<p>Latin ordinals: Overall, nice and legible. You may look at how the bar interacts with numerals, and consider making it narrower. I can&rsquo;t guess from looking at the documents.</p>
<p>%/perthousand: the 0&rsquo;s dominate the bar.</p>
<p>equal or greater / equal/less: Do you have a preference for them touching? Does anyone? Is there a correct approach? I happen to usually prefer them as discrete shapes (like plus or minus), but I haven&rsquo;t researched it.</p>
<p>cent: has a much heavier vertical bar than &lsquo;$&rsquo;. Why? (Keep in mind my treatment of both on !Crass Roots, I might just be crazy, and even considering my opinion batty on your part.)</p>
<p>Euro/Sterling/etc: I love the center bars on these, they feel good to the eye.</p>
<p>Florin: This is the most inconsistent glyph, in my opinion. The broadening, serifless shaft seems to just make it stick out, and the join with the top arch looks a touch abrupt. The vertical proportions however, look good, not too heavy-handed.</p>

<p>Florin: Is this still a valid currency symbol? I thought any country that had used such a thing is now in the Euro zone. Anyway, I agree it is the most inconsistent character in the font, but it is one of those that is pretty inconsistent in any typeface I&rsquo;ve looked at, frequently based on the italic f, and more often than not an italic f from a totally unrelated font. In an earlier iteration I had it as an integral with a crossbar, but that seemed less right (or at least more wrong) than the one I currently have.</p>
<p>¢/$: You&rsquo;re right, the vertical bars are different weights. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do about that.</p>
<p>%,‰: Again, good point. It is a struggle to get those &ldquo;o&quot;s not to dominate without making them too light.</p>
<p>∞: I didn&rsquo;t want this to look like just a sideways eight, but it looks like the magnetic field diagram doesn&rsquo;t translate well either.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way, too. Whenever I am about to submit a monster post, I do a quick copy-paste into notepad, just in case. I trust the intarweb as far as I can throw it.</p>
<p>If I want the 0&rsquo;s to look like real inf/sup numbers, I try that trick of making them independent of the intended combined symbol. Or, I go for something else completely, and draw the percent as it&rsquo;s own item, then duplicate the last 0-type-thing for the perthou.</p>
<p>On ∞, I&rsquo;d say that your overall proportions are successfully distinct, and that it would still be a far leap to say it would look too &ldquo;8&rdquo; afterwards. Especially when the &lsquo;8&rsquo; of the same face is the more classical offset thins touching a thick. There is some decorative face that probably has an &lsquo;8&rsquo; like your ∞, but then there is probably one where the x looks like your asterisk, too.</p>
<p>Perhaps a fresh single-character thread might do the trick, if you aren&rsquo;t confident in the design.</p>
<p>I appreciate your taking time to consider all I said. I know how annoying it is to have to recreate a post, but if you had anything else as meta-feedback, I&rsquo;m curious. If any of it was crazy-talk, I&rsquo;d like to learn from this as well. Or, if there was something I didn&rsquo;t explain well enough, I can revisit it.</p>
<p>Please, again, don&rsquo;t take anything I&rsquo;ve said too seriously, unless perhaps you keep hearing it from others as well. Anyway, it was great to focus like that on a face, and I sure look forward to seeing .16++!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>M: That is one that has given me trouble from the start. I have yet anouther new design in the next iteration, and corresponding changes in the N, but I still feel it isn&rsquo;t quite right.</p>
<p>Superior/inferior/fraction numerals: The numbers are based on the full size forms of an earlier version, and haven&rsquo;t yet caught up with subsequent changes. I do like this older version of the 3. At full size it made a pleasant &lt;3 emoticon, but didn&rsquo;t fit in with the rest of the font very well. I think it fares well enough at the reduced size, tough, and I may keep it. They could all stand a little beefing up in the horizontals, but too much will durn them into blobs.</p>
<p>Œ: The sidebearings are: Œ 50 80, Æ 70 60, A 70 70, O 40 40, E 80 60. The horizontals are longer on the plain E, but I&rsquo;ll pull back on tthe E side of Œ to get them lined up. This may not always be right to space ligatures the same as their respective components, but it&rsquo;s a good thing to point out if their difference is too obvious.</p>

Weird, huh?</p>
<p>The Mac Expert set includes positions for small caps and punctuation, OSF, more superior/inferior/fraction numbers, and lots of spaces marked .notdef. Most of these positions, even if they are defined, don&rsquo;t have Unicode numbers assigned to them.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I kind of forget what all I tweaked in v.16 and whatnot. I came down with the flu last week and am only just now recovering—I think I was in a bit of a delirium when I posted the last package.
I stole the idea for the mid-stem serif on the l from someone else&rsquo;s project on here. There is historic precedent for the thing so I hope the one I was inspired by doesn&rsquo;t mind. It actually helps to solve a lot of the spacing problems that letter was giving me. I wouldn&rsquo;t put that spur in the fl and ffl ligs because that would basically extend the crossbar into the l, making a confusing A like shape. I know lots of fonts have that feature, but it&rsquo;s not a good one, in my opinion.</p>
<p>As I said before, I switched the encoding to Macintosh Expert, and now all the glyphs seem to encode properly in the TTF file, but now I have twice as many character slots as I had before, and half of the new ones are not defined. What am I supposed to do with those? And what of the ones that are defined but don&rsquo;t have a unicode value? None of them have a keystroke, either.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I think I&rsquo;ll revert back to the v.15 Q and move this new one to an alternates set.</p>

<p>Move thedot on the i up It looks cramped. The i deresis too.
Make the w slightly less wide. It&rsquo;s a little ungainly 
Wheras the r &amp; m are really strong designs, the t seems unfinnished. I would start again with it maybe. That r is maybe the best thing in the font. It&rsquo;s so robust &amp; confident. You might have to reduce the anle at which the arm ends to get better letter fitting later on but its tasty!
The little serif on the g is too light. It doesn&rsquo;t fit. It lacks confidence.</p>
<p>This would be a good time to start looking at the white shapes between letters and see what you are making. The white shapes should be balanced with each other. You can solve a portion of this with kerning but you should try to get 50-75% there with the basic combinations so you don&rsquo;t make yourself crazy making special kern combos for 1000s of combinations. To get good interletter spacing you have 3 choices- modify the shapes, modify the side bearings, modify the kerning. It&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>The nice robust body weight of the shapes of the font seem like they need slightly beefier serifs to me.  The letters look like tigers with the feet of deer. What if they were thicker or if you reduced the curve very slightly?</p>
<p>I think the crossbar on the l creates as many problems as it solves. The l&rsquo;s shape ( especially the height at which the tail ends ) is the problem along with the sidebearings. In contrast the i is working.</p>
<p>The extreme thins vary a little too much maybe. I would think about harmonizing them. Look for example at the lc o &amp; the uc E or UC L. To me they don&rsquo;t belong together. I think the n gets the contrasts just right.</p>
<p>I hope some of this helps.</p>

<p>I am suggesting making them more hefty or thicker not longer. But try anything you think might work. Anything is okay if it looks right to you. Including leaving it as is.</p>
<p>Does my comment resonate with you at all? I am just seeing the rest of the face as more robust than the serifs - so much so that they don&rsquo;t seem to go together to me anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe take a look at other serifed faces as they become heavy like yours - clarendon, Unger&rsquo;s work, Font Font serifs etc. You will see a wide range of options used but also a certain relationship maintained. It&rsquo;s nature is perceptual &amp; optical not mathematical.</p>

OK, I figured out how to do this. It added a bunch of steps and I get these red dotted lines that I can&rsquo;t seem to get rid of even with the spell check turned off. This is still version 16 here.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow. This is polishing up nicely. I think you have made a good case for this flavor in type. I really like the lc r, the Delta, and the UC DE&amp;Z.</p>
<p>I have not looked in some time so I think my eye is fresh - here is what I am noticing now:</p>
<p>The weight of the c seems to light compared to the other glypshs. I think the top might be built up a lttle too. When your a zomed in it&rsquo;s not that noticable but when the letters are smaller it jumps out at me. The Cap C is also less poshed &amp; strong that the Other Glyphs. On the f thorn ligature I might let the arc start slightly higher on the left. The join on the ct ligature could be a bit weitier as it joins the t. There seems to be a litle toomuch weight on the right side of the u. The top left serif on the AE lig might have more weight &amp; flourish. The join in the middle of the a is bothering me. What if the join was straighter or more narrow? I think either thing would help it read as an a better/faster. The diacritics seem too close to me -especially over the d &amp; h. The double story g needs much much more work. But I expect you know that. It&rsquo;s a good idea to have though! The Ogoneks sem clunky - too much weight in their tops I think. I amnot sure about the blob end on the acute/grave. I like it&rsquo;s style but I think they should be more narrow &amp; pitched a bit hgher maybe. Have you read Adam T on french vs polish for this diacritic? The C in your copyright should be smaller. Why not go with a purely circular zero in the old style numbers? That would be cool. What abour harmonizing the ball weights in the old style a bit more too? They all look cool but they don&rsquo;t play quite well enough together yet. They are all grabbing too much limelight from each other because of the over-variation. What if the leg of the Cap l was shorter &amp; had more flair &amp; weight? What if the Join on the left side of the cap Y tapered slightly as it joined the base? The top right leg&rsquo;s Join on the Cap X might look better is it was slightly lower. Maybe that Breve should bend more/go higher. The Paragraph Mark seems a bit too heavy to me. The Q options will be a big selling point for this face. I think if the tails on the 1st two were heavier as they ended it would make the read as Qs more effectively. How about an Alt lc k.</p>
<p>I hope these ideas are useful to you. You have put in a ton of effort and I think it might pay off. I wold take Tiff&rsquo;s idea seriously too.</p>
<p>You know&hellip; The x height you have now is great for smaller text but the intensity of style is more appropriate for larger sizes Headlines and Display. Do you see what I mean? In a way I could imagine taking the design in 2 directions now. One for text that would be slightly softer in it&rsquo;s character and made for smaller sizes like you already have but maybe with some additional optical adjustments - Then you could have another one for Display &amp; headlines that would keep it&rsquo;s current character but be for larger sizes and so have longer ascenders and decenders and maybe some of the joins would become less bulky - stuff like that. Have you sen font families that do that kind of thing? If not. I can point you at some.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know what you mean about the weight being a little uncomfortable with the height. At text sixes I see it as kind of a medium or demi-bold weight, and a lighter version will be needed for the bulk of text use, but a somewhat reduced lc at this weight would be good for display.</p>
<p>As for the Polish accents and ogoneks, you mean the instructions here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/intro.html">http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/intro.html</a></p>
<p>right? I thought I had followed the instructions, but I see what you mean about the ogoneks being a bit chunky. Something gave me the impression they should be that way, but it didn&rsquo;t look right to me either. I haven&rsquo;t set up the Polish kreska accented letters yet, but I have perpared a mark for them (between the cedilla and the ring). t- and d-caron need the abbreviated apostrophe instead of the regular caron/háček.</p>

I am getting the impression I totally have to rework the spacing and kerning, but FontForge&rsquo;s metrics window is infruriatingly slow, at least compared to Fontographer&rsquo;s, and you can&rsquo;t load in a list of kerning words as far as I can tell. Anyway, there are a plethora of new characters now. I&rsquo;ve nearly filled out the Latin B area, and some of the IPA and Greek are getting filled in since some of the Latin B lowercase or derivors are in those areas, not that it matters a whole lot, or maybe it does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where I&rsquo;m going with this anymore. I feel like I&rsquo;ve lost focus, yet I&rsquo;m driven to keep working on it.</p>

<p>If this is a product you want to sell, each additional part demands a multiplication of refinement. In software-land, feature sets get locked well before a product&rsquo;s ships. Even really great ideas get shelved for later versions because otherwise, the first version never gets out the door. Cut out the most belaboring aspects, add what is needed to stay competitive, and keep track of your hours. :)</p>
<p>If it is a labor of love, your magnum opus, and all about the journey&hellip;
Take time, make more notes, get feedback and keep adding things. Or go for a walk if it isn&rsquo;t too hot. Have a life. Let things stew a bit in your brain and see what, if any, is the purpose. Get back to it when your vision takes you there. But don&rsquo;t rush or over-analyze it until you are sick of the project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good face, and everyone here &ldquo;can&rsquo;t wait&rdquo; to see it released. But we actually can wait. So figure out how far this needs to go for you, and go. Then stop. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Choz makes some really good points.</p>
<p>My guess is that when you are making the Latin B etc you are most likely working in an abstract way in the sense that you are taking an (unfamiliar?) shape and deciding how to interpret it. It&rsquo;s great - but fairly abstract.</p>
<p>If you want to evaluate what you are up to and gain focus - I suggest that you apply your type to a design project. Even a faux one - but ideally a real one. That will help you notice what is &amp; isn&rsquo;t working - and ground the work in a &lsquo;reality&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, maybe moving this into FontForge wasn&rsquo;t the best idea. It&rsquo;s a fine enough program for designing, but might be a nigh bid more powerful thatn I can handle in metrics handling.
In Fontographer, you could load in a text file of kerning words and shuttle down the list while making adjustments in the metrics window.
I cannot figure out how to do the same thing in FontForge, if it is possible at all. It appears that one has to type in whatever letters one wants to see in the metrics window. So inconvenient.</p>
<p>But anyway, while I&rsquo;ve had trouble working on the spacing, I haven&rsquo;t been idle. I&rsquo;ve expanded the character set to include support for Vietnamese, lots of obscure languages, as well as Greek and Cyrilic. Those last two are mostly just an experiment, since I have no idea how those are really supposed to be. but I&rsquo;ll have pics pf them up soon so you can tell me what you think of them.</p>

Actually the Cherokee is pretty complete but I have no idea whether or not it would be legible to native readers (same with the others too). I&rsquo;d be happy if these scripts just don&rsquo;t look too stupid or inappropriate. I&rsquo;m sure to get flamed for deriving too much from the Latin for these other scripts, but hey, I&rsquo;m learning here!</p>
<p>There are some bugs involving missing or incorrectly ordered glyphs in the new output files (pr-AgamemnonTwentySeven-dis1.pdf and pr-AgamemnonTwentySeven-ffd1.pdf, attached in the first post), but those are FontForge and/or Acrobat issues and I&rsquo;ve been talking to George Williams to get those resolved.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some of the foreign-language characters aren&rsquo;t looking good.
Russian:
Zhe should definitely point outward. zhe could probably use mirror, not rotational, symmetry, much as it makes the chirality seem wrong.
Left leg of El/el should be light.
Sha and Shcha are too narrow.
Ya should probably not have a light left leg.
be should have that flourish on top. This one looks very incomplete.
ef, strangely, should probably be rotationally symmetric. (Russian is full of paradoxes, isn&rsquo;t it?)
I&rsquo;m not a Russian, but I think Russians would agree with me on this: Never ever make ascending myagkij, tvyordij, and yery.</p>
<p>Greek:
Lambda is upside-down.
Xi should have weight in it somewhere. Most people make the strokes thick to solve that.
Pi doesn&rsquo;t need serifs on its serifs on top.
Almost all the lowercase forms look very amorphous. Try drawing a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; text face in Greek, then use that study to make the Greek here less erratic. These letterforms are too all-over-the-place to read with anything like smoothness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve drawn up a conjectural evolution of the gamma and nu. I think the nu evolved along a similar path to the mu, so I showed the mu for comparison, because it&rsquo;s more straightforward. I know I&rsquo;ve seen the second form for the nu, in <a href=http://www.greekfontsociety.org/pages/en_typefaces16th.html>GFS Complutum</a>, which is from the 16th century. These evolutions are my educated guesses, not confirmed historical stuff, so don&rsquo;t quote me too exhaustively. I don&rsquo;t know how we get from the Upsilon form to the upsilon form, but I&rsquo;d guess it was quite a bit of lazy handwriting among scribes. <img src="/images/old-images/allpurposetemp_3945.PNG" alt="">

By the way, t&rsquo;s a pity that such nice glyphs like your spesmilo sign would be rarely (if ever) used.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I see it as not so much being that the euro&rsquo;s bars are too far apart, but some of the other horizontal double bars are, out of necessity, too close together.
And, though it&rsquo;s a rarely used glyph, I know a few Esperantists who might appreciate having the spesmilo.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Sm thing you show, I had to warn a designer recently away from a feature that was a different scale and color than the rest of the font. It had been a while since I had to do that, but it used to be a common occurrence. Scaleable type just can&rsquo;t deal with that kind of thing very well. This hardly seems like a face so shy one couldn&rsquo;t swell the bottom of the S to University Roman proportions to widen and weighten the m?</p>
<p>Also, the bars on the d thing, seem rather harsh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really impressed with the breadth of progress on this face, what a lot of good work.</p>
