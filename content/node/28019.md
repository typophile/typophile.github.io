  body: "It resembles Font Bureau <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/streamline/\">'Streamline'</a>
    but the letter shapes and strokes are not the same. My thought was a vertically
    stretched and slanted Font Diner <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=air_conditioner&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=radio&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha\">'Air

  body: Hmm, Dan that's a puzzler. I've just been to check if there is a lighter version
    of <a/href="http://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage2.htm"> Magneto Extended</a>
    but no, Leslie hasn't made one yet so that's not it. Maybe a customised piece.
    Kaufmann and Gillies Gothic also come to mind.

    is similar, though not an exact match.

    There's no 'test drive' to prove it, but it sure seems to be a match.\r\n\r\n
