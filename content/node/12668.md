body: Forgive me if this question has been asked before as I'm a new poster, but what
  exactly seems to be the definition of sans serif these days? Fonts such as Goudy
  Sans, Optima, Officina and newer faces such as Sebastian and Vialog seem to really
  be pushing the boundaries of the definition. Large stroke contrast, pseudo and half
  serifs...are these breaking the rules, or is there really no clear defintion? I
  ask with a particular leaning towards typefaces for signage.

  body: "The only real qualification is that they have no serifs. Generally, most
    sans have little or no difference between strokes. However, there are some that
    do have stroke contrast, and some that taper at the end; but if they don't have
    serifs - they are stills sans. \r\n\r\nA few have tried to blur the line - like
    Rotis Semi Serif and Semi Sans; as well as Theis, which has a serif (theserif),
    a sans (thesans), and a mix (themix). But as far as I know, there is no 'catagory'
    of fonts called semi-serif.  \r\n\r\nThere are subcatagories of sans serifs, like
    sloped, and stressed. As there is a subcatagory for serifs - hybrid serif (tiny
    serifs).  So, for now, most fonts still fit neatly within catagories (for those
    that don't, I just call 'em display type ;)\r\n\r\nHope that helped\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Well, I'm speaking more about about changes within the letterform itself.
    The examples you list make clear deliniations of differences. Thesis and Rotis
    have completely different fonts within their family. What I mean is, for example
    if Goudy Sans is classified as a sans serif, then why isn't ITC Serif Gothic?

    Sans and ITC Serif Gothic were both created by their respective designers in order
    to \"be different\" from the norm, and as such, were named by the designers themselves
    to reflect the intent. \r\n\r\nGoudy Sans\r\nIn 1929 Frederic W. Goudy developed
    a three-weight family for Lanston Monotype with an intent of being \"different\".
    The result was more playful than the formal types of the time. Also, the italics
    followed a more cursive feeling which, by the way, are some of my personal favorites.\r\n\r\nAt
    Agfa-Compugraphic, Goudy Sans was expanded to six-weights and released initially
    for phototypesetters, and afterwards, digital imagesetters. It was later licensed
    to ITC where they expanded the family to eight weights.\r\n\r\nThe most unique
    aspect of the Goudy Sans type family is that it offered an almost complete set
    of incredible cap alternates which are no longer available in fonts today. \r\n\r\nITC
    Serif Gothic\r\nAround 1972, as the urban legend goes, (Herb) \"Lubalin felt that
    the industry needed a typeface to fill the gap between Gothic and Roman. So, he
    and Tony Di Spigna developed Serif Gothic.\" \r\n-Herb Lubalin Art Director, Graphic
    Designer and Typographer.\r\nGertrude Snyder & Alan Peckolick\r\n\r\nFilling the
    gap resulted in a design that was neither truly sans nor really serif, and its
    name reflects the attempt at cross-pollination.\r\n\r\nSo, to finally answer your
    question, both of these type families were meant to different from the start and
    to intentionally defy pigeon-holding.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
