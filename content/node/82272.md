  but the capital \"F\" doesn't match. This is an image from a current product available

  body: "It seems most similar to Jason Walcott's <a href=\"http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Fenway-Park-JBT0000019?skeywords=fenway%20park%20font&stermids=22485\">Fenway
    Park</a>, but it looks more like it was drawn by hand using some other font as
    a model. BTW, the 'r' doesn't match Gelateria either. This is another of the fonts
    that resembles the ever-popular OptiSport Script, which we have talked about many
    times.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
