  in a Didone such as Didot and the like. (More Didot or Bodoni than Museo or Egyptienne.)
  Also open to condensed faces, too. \r\n\r\nThis is for logotype design so even if
  your suggestion doesn't fit the bill, anything helps for inspiration as I may end
  up drawing the ligature myself. \r\n\r\nThanks\u2014"

    for!\r\n\r\nI'm am specifically looking for something where the tittle of the
    'i' and the shoulder (terminal?) of the 'r' are the same/united. Riccard's example
    is not quite on the mark. I admit that in the traditional style of didones, this
    may be sacrilege but who knows. \r\n\r\nAlso wanted to say that I wasn't able
    to find a metal sample of Cheltenham, (though there are some half-decent flickr
    pictures up, but nothing of substance.)"
