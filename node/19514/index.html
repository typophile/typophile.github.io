<p>Depends on your skills and needs. You will find very easy and fast tools like RapidWeaver or you could get the professional app Dreamweaver (this ships as a cross-plattform CD). Both tools include FTP functions, but you can also take a look at Transmit 3.5.</p>

<p>You can transfer through the terminal if you&rsquo;re handy with Unix, but I would recommend Fetch for ftp. It&rsquo;s pretty cheap and really easy to use.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no web page editing software that I&rsquo;m aware of with the operating system. Maybe you need to get the premium suite, which comes with GoLive. The next edition of the suite might be pretty exciting, the CEO of Apple stated that they are going to more tightly integrate their product line. They own Macromedia so we shall see…</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true about the Adobe switch, you just need to transfer your license, but check their website to make sure.</p>
<p>Macosxhints is great if you want to dive into Unix. MacFixIt has its merits. The Apple boards are about as good as any…</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million boards out there for Macintosh, you don&rsquo;t really need to subscribe to a magazine.</p>

<p>Make sure the ILife is current on the machine you buy or you have to buy the upgrade&hellip; I bought my powerbook sometime last year when IPhoto 5 had been already released and saying it supported RAW photo files&hellip; but the currently shipping Macs all had ILife old&hellip;</p>
<p>typical don&rsquo;t get me started on all the Macs I bought,,, Mac SE ($3999, 1 meg ram.. 20meg hard drive) then the SE30 cames out months later, Wallstreet Powerbook no floppy, no USB then Apple discontinues the floppy drive and the only way to transfer was with a PCMCIA card.</p>

<p><cite>The CS2 suite is not going to run native on that machine until CS3 - second quarter 2007.</cite></p>
<p>I can wait until then to upgrade (using CS now). It seems funny Adobe isn&rsquo;t ready with that sooner. So this dual processor thing is that new&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m been fairly oblivious to Mac progress since it wasn&rsquo;t an option for me before. I just know I banged around on one before and it all seemed fairly intuitive, so it doesn&rsquo;t scare me. And I&rsquo;m told PS (where I live) will be pretty much be the same.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">One piece of advice: go to the refurb section of the Apple store (it&rsquo;s at the lower right of the Store page - the red SAVE banner). These machines are factory refurb, have been given new serial numbers and have all the same guarantees as new machines for as much as 1/3 off the price. I bought an iMac there for a song and it works great. You should buy an extended Apple Care protection plan as well (even for a new machine).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m a longtime Mac user but I haven&rsquo;t taken the plunge switching to the Intel Macs yet. The 17&quot; MacBook Pro does look very nice however. Virtualization technology (such as Parallels) that allows you to run Windows apps with decent performance also makes the Intel Macs quite attractive.</p>
<p>If you are considering having a laptop as your only machine, I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to think carefully about backups and the AppleCare extended warranty.</p>
<p>Although the machines are pretty expensive, after a while the data on the machine will be more valuable than the machine itself. If the laptop is lost or stolen, or if you need to send it in for repairs and they wipe the disk, you&rsquo;ll be toast unless you have good backups. You can get a coupla hundred G external FireWire disk for $150-$300 depending on speed and capacity.</p>
<p>You should also consider the AppleCare extended warranty, which costs $349. If you carry the laptop everywhere it&rsquo;ll be susceptible to damage from being jostled around, connectors being plugged and unplugged (well maybe not the cool new magnetic power plug), being dropped, having beverages spilt into the keyboard, etc. Any of these can be fatal. I&rsquo;ve fortunately never had to use AppleCare. However, there are many Mac users at my workplace and several report excellent repair service under AppleCare.</p>
<p>These do add significantly to the cost of the machine. I recommend you factor backups and AppleCare into the cost of any new machine that you buy. Whatever you decide, happy Mac&rsquo;ing! I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll enjoy it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I backup my Mac portable to a cheap HD in a Firewire enclosure. I think the street value to my 80GB drive, with enclosure,  is about $100. I use the free utility Carbon Copy Cloner to &lsquo;clone&rsquo; my whole laptop drive onto a 30GB partition I&rsquo;ve set up. This is something that an average user can figure out, no deep technical knowledge necessary. If my drive is stolen, destroyed, etc. I&rsquo;ll just get a new one and clone my data over. I try to do this every month or so. I usually set it to clone before I go to bed, it takes 30min or so&hellip;.
I recommend it.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t buy Applecare. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it&rsquo;s a bad idea, it&rsquo;s just that its just that I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ll get my money out of it. Apple products already have a warranty.</p>
