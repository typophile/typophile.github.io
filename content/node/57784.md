  flyer. Really sorry it's so small, it's the only size I've got!\r\n\r\nThe stencil
  style font has a real urban/grunge/industrial feel to it. \r\n\r\nHopefully a typophile
  can help me.\r\n\r\nPS: Despite following the instructions in the 'read me first'
  post I can't seem to get the flyer in the body of the post."

    shape whereas on the link provided the 'B' looks more like a backwards '3'.\r\n\r\nDo
    you think it's been modded or is it a different font?"
