  - small cap. too) eszett glyph.\r\nShould or shouldn't I make smcp version? What's
  the common practice?\r\n"

  body: If you design a capital eszet, and you have small-caps in the font, then you
    of course also have to design the small-caps eszet.

  body: "Germans told me that by default lowercase Eszett is best mapped to \u2018SS\u2019
    as an uppercase glyph (same goes for small caps). Current German school orthography
    apparently calls for this substitution and many of your customers will have to
    stick to the traditional spelling. Capital Eszett (and its small-caps rendering)
    can (and, according to some, should) be made available in a stylistic set. Making
    it default is likely to cause problems for users who don\u2019t work in OpenType-savvy
    applications.\r\n\r\nMy opinion: If you can come up with a nice shape, please
    include it in your typeface."
