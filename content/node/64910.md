  might be able to identify what this symbol actually is,\_perhaps it's name or even
  what it means. I've scoured the internet and found only more simplistic or more
  complicated runes. Maybe someone could point me to a better source than I've found...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nChris"

    it? \r\nAre you sure it is a rune and not just a symbol with a runic feel?\r\n"

  body: Haha, I suppose it could possibly be merely in the style of runes. How disappointing!
    (though quite typical in these post-modern times). I found it in a mix of various
    charms. I have found some examples of runes with a central vertical stroke and
    spines going out either way, but they tend to be all in one direction per side...

    futhark, check http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Runen_futhark.jpg\r\n\r\nit
    also reminds me of rudolf koch\u2019s ancient symbols. i think p22 sells a digital
    version of koch\u2019s symbols (\u201Dkoch signs\u201C), maybe check their site
    for examples or google for \u201Dkoch signs\u201C"
