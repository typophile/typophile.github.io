  text fonts, so I'm asking you resident gurus (and of course now I want to know too).
  :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id_gescheitert_3620.jpg]\r\n\r\nHe
  has also sent me a PDF, which I've attached.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Acrobat, click APPLE+D (on Macs) or probably CTRL+D on Windows and get your desired
    fontinformation in the department \xBBfont\xAB (Schriften). Not that Akira isn\u2019t
    marvelous and fast \u2026 I think he doesn\u2019t have to use this trick."

    the most expensive typeface on the planet? I'm a bit shocked."

  body: "<cite>3952 Euros for the whole family</cite>\r\n\r\nCounter question: Who
    does need the <em>whole</em> family? I mean, seriously, Lexicon has a whopping
    24 styles, that\u2019s a lot \u2013\_too much \u2013 for a text face. I admit,
    it actually would be nice to have both the economic No. 1 with shortened extenders
    and the elegant No. 2, with the generous proportions \u2013 just in case. But
    why 6 weights?\r\nTEFF offers two \u2018A, D, F bundles\u2019, which looks like
    their recommended purchase. It is significantly cheaper than picking just any
    6 styles of your own choice. You can call that paternalism, but that\u2019s just
    their price policy. It still is expensive, but \u20AC 1347 for a complete working
    high-class family sounds much better than the other quote, doesn\u2019t it?"

  body: "FWIW, when I said it's expensive I was mainly looking at single-font prices.
    \r\nAnd I don't think I've ever seen a family where a single font would be $382.
    \r\nI previously thought of Documenta as rather expensive, and this is more than
    \r\ntwice Documenta's single-font price."

  body: True..especially at that price..you don't need everything. But 1347 Euros?
    (sorry..I'm trying to work that out in Singapore dollars and what that could get
    me) other than a typeface which I would then use for every damn project that comes
    along!

  body: "The price is obviously that high because they want to cater to a certain
    market, and possibly even limit the circulation so only certain publications use
    the typeface. To keep it somewhat exclusive and not too common.\r\n\r\nSo it won't
    be used for every random call-girl advertisement in some newspaper. ;)\r\n\r\nThen
    again, I also think it's one of the most beautiful typefaces ever designed (together
    with Trinit\xE9)."
