body: "So, I have about 5 years experience as a designer. 3 years in publishing with
  some promotions experience, and a little over a year and a half at a small agency
  (5 people) specializing in animal health/medical advertising.\r\n\r\nMy goal since
  getting out of publishing, has been to go work at an agency where my skills fit
  in- it's not where I work now.\r\n\r\nSo, taking a job at an internal design department
  for a company NOT involved in something I am really interested in (more medical
  stuff) is probably a step in the WRONG direction, yeah?\r\n\r\nMy goal had been
  to keep building my portfolio in this job and on my own, for at least another 6
  months, and really focus on the places where I live that would be a more diverse
  set of clients and hopefully it would be somewhere I could stay for awhile.\r\n\r\nI
  am 28, so I am kind of ready for something closer to a dream job.\r\n\r\nSo tell
  me, anything other than an agency, knowing my goals, is a bad move, no matter how
  much I dislike this position I am in, right?"

  body: I don't think whether you work in-house vs. at an agency really plays too
    much into your career goals. The key is the job/work itself and how well it meets
    your portfolio goals.
