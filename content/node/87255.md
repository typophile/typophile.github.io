body: "Just ran into a very strange thing where FontLab kind of went nuts on me. I
  was drawing outlines in FL for a few glyphs in one glyph window. Not sure exactly
  what triggered it, maybe merging outlines on a glyph. Anyway\u2026 all of a sudden
  I have what look to be random composite glyphs in my window. I can't select them
  to delete them. If I click on a composite I'm brought to another random glyph cell.
  They all appear to have composites in them. I can't even figure if there are any
  patterns to which composites have shown up in which cells. \r\n\r\nWhen it first
  started I immediately quit FontLab hoping I could get rid of the glitch. Didn't
  help. Any ideas what to do? My first thought since I only have Upper and Lowercase
  and a handful of alternates so far is to just start a new FL data file and Paste
  Special only the outlines into the new file.  If any one has any ideas I would be
  very appreciative. Seems like the file is completely corrupt at this point.\r\n\r\nStephen\r\n"

  body: I think I figured out the problem. It had under view/show layers/neighbors
    selected. Not sure how that got turned on since it shows no keyboard shortcuts
    for it, but it was on. Sorry for my panic, I had simply never clicked on that
    before and had no idea what it did.

  body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI'm having a problem with my Font.... after generating
    it and using programs (flash, word) to write with it, I see that the tops of the
    taller letters as well as the bottoms of some letters with \"tails\" are cut off......
    what could possible be the problem? \r\nBy the way - the point hight areas that
    the metrics window shows are 720 and -250.... if I go as tall as 840 for the ascender
    height could that be the reason ? I thought so but then it wouldn't explain the
    bottoms getting cut off as well.... \r\n\r\nPlease help, thanks very much in advance...\r\n\r\nA"

  body: "Hello Stephen, Glad you solve the trouble you found with neighbors, that's
    exactly what happen there.\r\n\r\nHi Asceder, According that I know if you choose
    \ the able area must to be 1000 pt from descender to ascender, you can combine
    values equivalent between boths (for Example you can set ascender heigh 750 +
    descender heigh must to be -250 = then you obtain a total 1000 pt). Any shape
    must to be inside of this boundaries, if you out this area, at least in word your
    font will be cropped out. I don't know exactly why this happen but you can avoid
    that trouble keeping that 1000 pts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4115.jpg]\r\nFile/Font
