  a project I am currently working on: some of the \u2018Roman\u2019 lowercase Greek
  letters appear too latinised (e.g., pi and tau with a thin horizontal stroke), and
  \u2014 more importantly \u2014 the Italic ones are not all distinguishable from
  similar-looking Latin letters (e.g., a and alpha), which makes them useless in mathematical
  formulae.\r\n\r\nBoth aesthetic and practical considerations have thus brought me
  to look for a font whose lowercase Greek letters could work together with Sabon
  Greek uppercase and Latin. So far, the best I have come up with is Garamond Premier
  Pro Roman, which I think could work both for short Greek citations in the text and
  for variable names in the formulae. Would that be a bad choice? Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any comments and ideas."

    But what a good pairing is depends on the context of use: is this for a parallel
    text, where the two scripts are in paragraph-blocks but not intermingling, or
    an edition with Greek embedded within English (as you'd get, for example, in a
    linguistics textbook)?\r\n   "

  body: "To elaborate on what Gerry Leonidas implicitly said, and that being the crux
    of the matter: if you are working on a text where the Greek alphabet is embedded
    within the Latin one, you may look for a match for a very long time indeed and
    never find it, because the main points are really the x-height, the weight, the
    detail, etc., and, most of all, the overall tone (\u2018colour\u2019). Why don\u2019t
    you just go for another, single typeface? There are some good ones out there,
    which treat Greek as Greek, and not as a subdivision of Latin. I don\u2019t know
    who developed this \u2018Greek\u2019 for Sabon, but I am (almost) sure it wasn\u2019t
    Tchitchold."

    lowercase from typeface B is impossible. But for running text, be sure, this will
    be hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen, choosing a typeface whith both decent Latin and
    Greek might be the way to go. You shall find something which meets your requirements.\r\n\r\n2.
    Check some of [[http://www.tiro.com/fonts.html|John Hudson\u2019s fonts]].\r\n\r\n3.
    Check Johannes K\xFCster\u2019s [[http://www.typoma.de/en/index.html|extension

    Check [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=218&changelang=2|Andron]],
    which has been designed exactly for the case you describe, with a Greek lowercase
    to harmonize but not to be equalized.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Finally, the last exit may
    be to do new glyphs for Sabon Greek."

  body: "We all seem to agree that the existing Greek (or \u2018Greek\u2019, as Ton
    Aner put it) is worthy neither of Tschichold and Sabon nor of the Greek script.
    I might be able to improve the worst glyphs slightly, but a proper Greek Sabon
    would probably have to involve a full set of new lowercase letters, which is far
    beyond my abilities.\r\n\r\nAs Lex Kominek seemed to imply, a less latinised Greek
    might work better when two different fonts are used for Greek (lowercase) and
    Latin. The suggested combinations with existing Greek fonts give the following
    results:\r\n\r\nMinion\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek-Minion_4300.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nGentium:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek-Gentium_4308.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nGaramond:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek-Garamond_5992.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nChoosing
    a different font is not really an option:  Sabon has the right style for a technical
    academic work, it happens to be the institution's standard typeface, and I have
    added some mathematical glyphs, brackets etc. for use with LaTeX which would have
    to be redesigned to match a different font.\r\n\r\nThanks for mentioning the extensions
    to Minion (of which I was aware, but I did not know that they had become available),
    as well as Andron, whose Runic and Fraktur-inspired parts in particular look very
    interesting."

    It is lively and the weight harmonises well with Sabon.
