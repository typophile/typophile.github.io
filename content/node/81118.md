  as well in the world of type design. But what are some typefaces that come close
  if it wasn't for one little thing (one character, the italics, usability, numerals,
  etc)?\r\n\r\nExamples:  \r\n\r\nBaskerville would be a perfect typeface if only
  its 'a' wasn't so wide and round.\r\nUnivers would be a perfect typeface if only
  it had small caps.\r\nFutura would be a perfect typeface if only its ascenders weren't
  so weirdly tall.\r\nMiller would be a perfect typeface if only it's 'k' didn't have
  a curved leg.\r\n\r\nHave at it!"

  body: "<cite>WTFC</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, for one, the similar thread I linked to spawned
    several interesting discussions. And, for another, I\u2019m sure several new great
    typefaces were born when someone started thinking along the lines of \u201CI love
    this typeface, but I can\u2019t stand its [insert the feature of your choice].
    I bet I can do better!\u201D."

  body: "Century Expanded would be a perfect typeface if only it were a little less
    condensed.\r\nImprint would be a perfect typeface if the capital J didn't descend
    below the line.\r\nGaramond would be a perfect typeface if the capital J didn't
    descend below the line, and the counter on the lowercase e were larger.\r\nTimes
    Roman would be a perfect typeface if only everyone else wasn't using it.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, levity aside, and referring to the older thread referenced here,
    the serifs on the I in Bell Gothic are there for a reason - so that people reading
    something in it can, easily and unambiguously, in all cases, tell I, l, and 1
    apart with no chance of error. This was a good idea for a typeface for setting
    telephone books."

    on a crowded subway.  From your vantage point just above his left shoulder, you
    notice a small bit of lint disturbing the otherwise astonishingly flawless appearance.
    \ While his head is turned away, you flick the lint off of his lapel without him
    ever noticing. \r\n\r\nAt your stop, you leave the train with the full knowledge
    that, on this day, you have achieved a perfection which was solely due to your
    amazing skill and superior perspective."

  body: I never look at other people's work with the thought of it being something
    for me to fix.  I would much rather let it be what is is or was to them. I have
    more than enough fixing to do on my own work and don't seem to be getting very
    far with that ;-)
