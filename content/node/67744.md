  choose 3 typeface families and produce layouts for each. For each one, we had to
  use one typeface from that family and showcase it by displaying the alphabet and
  using general information to use and show as copy. \r\n\r\nOne of my three was definitely
  my favorite and i was excited for the critique that night to find out what my instructor
  thought. Turns out he didn't really like it. He said of my three it was the most
  innovative but he wasn't crazy about it. I personally think he didn't like it because
  he wouldn't use the type the way I did. \r\n\r\nSo my question is, are typography
  and design subjective or are the universal rules and boundaries that must be adhered
  to in order to be successful?"

    are not. And what is practical and impractical is also subjective, especially
    if the brief is quite open. If your professor just doesn\u2019t like your fonts
    on arbitrary aesthetics grounds then use the fonts you like. But if you have picked
    fonts that fail to meet the project brief, or that keep the design from functioning
    as it should, pick new ones. Make sure to ask your professors why they aren\u2019t
    crazy about your designs\u2014you\u2019ll learn more that way, and so will they."

  body: "I can see it both ways. My initial thought is that taste is subjective, we
    all like or dislike different things. Design itself is less subjective because
    a piece either accomplishes what it's meant to accomplish or it doesn't (with
    varying levels of success, granted).\r\n\r\nThere are pieces that I may not like
    or might not be similar to my personal style, but if they communicate their message
    well I can agree that they're well-executed. It sounds like your professor's comment
    was similar, he thought your piece was innovative but didn't particularly like
    it."

  body: "Of course there are certain rules which make a design that will always have
    some degree of aesthetics, think of the golden ratio, using only red and black
    as printing colors for typography or things like contrast types (color or shapes)
    They will always give you an image, if correctly used, that will be pleasing to
    the eye.\r\n\r\nBut mostly, these rules are there to be broken, to make more visually
    appetizing designs. Those rules have been in use for a long time and give us visual
    clues on what to expect since we've seen them so much around. But in the end the
    main point the design will have to convey is information or a message, which in
    the end is what graphic design is all about, and that's how such assignments (at
    least in my opinion) should be rated.\r\n\r\nSo design isn't really subjective,
    it's all down to the message you want to get across. If you think your instructor
    is letting himself be led by own opinions and not the briefing, it's best to analyze
    why he would find it that way (or better just ask him) Myself, of course depending
    on the brief, wouldn't let conventions or strict uses of a type hinder me with
    creating a design, but of course I don't know how strict the assignments are.\r\n\r\nRemember,
    your own design always makes perfect sense while a different person can sometimes
    just not understand it, or find it pleasing."

  body: "I'll refrain from going into a personal opinion about design, kerning and
    typography but will go down another avenue, which is Arial.\r\n\r\nReadability
    and all aside, does this poster convey what Arial is about ? [A cheap rip off
    with awful glyph finishing and details.. er.. sorry]\r\n\r\nNow, you can of course
    place it in any timeframe, but I'd place Arial where it originates, which isn't
    the slick y2k era but early computing. Also, the C in 'thic' and R in 'arial'
    aside, there aren't many 'blow-ups' on what defines the font, the g and o glyphs
    in arial aren't that characteristic [while the capital G for instance is on the
    other hand]\r\n\r\nI think the main issue with your design [for me at least that
    is] is that, especially when it's meant as some form of typespecimen it doesn't
    really bring the message of what kind of font Arial is, and perhaps that's what
    your teach was after as well.\r\n\r\nAlthough I must add something else, Arial
    is heavily used on the web, and will always pop up in designs since everyone has
    it on his computer. Perhaps if you had shown just a digital version with some
    changes, exaggerating the idea that 'everyone' has Arial, you could have come
    up with a pretty solid specimen, showing Arial use and what it stands for/is used
    for (nowadays)\r\n\r\nHope I din't get too lost in opinions, but reading from
    your original post it sortof looked to me as an assignment to deepen out the uses
    of various fonts and how to visualize them. English isn't my best language when
    talking about this stuff so I hope it comes across sortof okay."

  body: I understand everything you said, but the assignment was to emphasize the
    typeface family, in this case gothic/sans serif, rather than the font itself.
    He didn't even read the content of the copy, just wanted us to practice formatting
    it. I did some research and found that a lot of these types of fonts emerged during
    the Art Deco movement, which served as inspiration for my design.

    be said that the rivers, hyphens, column spacing, kerning - pretty much all the
    factors governing the rational use of legible/readable body copy in those two
    columns look as though they weren't even considered.\r\n\r\nI look at projects
    I've done in the past and I shake my head. I think this will be one of those projects
    for you, and there's nothing wrong with that. When you finish school, remember
    to revisit this piece.\r\n\r\nDesign is subjective, but using a tool like typography
    to its best advantage shouldn't be. People build creative things with hammers
    and nails, but they don't swing the hammer in a figure-eight when they do it...
    if that analogy makes any sense.\r\n\r\nI remember when I did a similar project,
    we were encouraged to highlight features of the type and lay them out as if they
    were features of an automotive advert... There's no allusion to what the face
    is intended for...\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful feedback. :/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I will give you credit, you somehow made Arial look better than I thought
    it could look. I would have chosen a different typeface to highlight the Gothic
    sans serif family of typefaces. That said, having been a student I know that students
    don't always have access to a wide variety of fonts. As oranginas pointed out
    there isn't much that's remarkable about Arial. It's pretty much a cheap knockoff
    of Helvetica and Franklin Gothic because Microsoft didn't want to pay licensing
    (that's the story I've heard at least).\r\n\r\nYou're going to run into a lot
    of subjectivity in design. When I was in school my advisor and I had vastly different
    ideas about design. He is very old-school, influenced heavily by the Swiss aesthetic
    whereas my heroes are designers like Paula Sher, David Carson and Miles Reid.
    None of whom can in any way be linked to the Swiss aesthetic. Aesthetic is aesthetic
    and it's purely subjective. Some people prefer structure and minimalism and I
    prefer to see designs that break rules. In order to break those rules though,
    we need to learn the rules, and we need to learn what can or cannot be broken.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    good luck in school. It's very important that you don't take criticism personally,
    even if someone is trying to make it a personal thing. They're probably making
    it personal because we are all human and we all react to design in personal ways."

    universal rules and principles that must be learned and manipulated.</em>\r\n\r\nFor
    me, modernism is the most poignant idea. I return to it time and time again to
    measure the ideals against the realities. The term is misleading because is at
    once a philosophy (perpetual) and a movement (partially eclipsed). It is a misconception
    that modernism is a rule, given that it's origin is dynamic departure, and that
    the modernist movement encapsulates a broad spectrum of political ideas from socialism
    to fascism, disparate and united all at once. The search for empirical truths
    is one emergent aspect of modernism, but by no means definitive as suggested.\r\n\r\n<em>But
    a good afternoon spent studying design untouched by modernism reveals that it\u2019s
    all just a matter of taste, and tastes change with the wind.</em>\r\n\r\nI think
    it is also important to note that the protagonists of the modernist movement took
    many cues from outside their own culture and time, Josef and Anni Albers looked
    to indigenous South American culture, Gaugin worked toward primitivism etc. In
    that sense modernism is touched by the things one might consider untouched by
    modernism. These influences have been taken up inside of it, as an influence,
    something to react to, something to learn from, some forgotten value \u2013 eclipsed
    by religious art, illusionism and the weight of European culture \u2013 reinstated.\r\n\r\nThis
    is what a college assignment should challenge, embrace, assault, imbue."

    the main design 'rule' that I go by. I went to a tech collage, so was taught more
    about the technical process of designing without a lot of theory (which I'm catching
    up on now), but for me, the main thing I've come to learn about design over the
    last 10 years is that it's about relationships, as is any artistic work (type,
    painting, music). Although this isn't a 'rule', I definitely feel that by understanding
    the relationship of elements on a page, you are better able to convey what you
    want, which ideally, is communicating the message behind the design.  "

    asking is design subjective, remember that design is intention. \r\nA few questions
    arise from this:\r\n\r\n- Did your work truly communicate what was intended? \r\n-
    Did your work come out based on the limitations of your own style?\r\n- Or you
    designed for the problem at hand instead?\r\n- If the receiver doesn't think so,
