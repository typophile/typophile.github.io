  body: I&#39;ve read a couple of novels on my Jornada, and now that I&#39;ve switched
    over to using my Nokia 9290 as my main PDA, it&#39;s even easier to read &#40;via
    Acrobat Reader&#41;.  <BR> <BR>It can be useful for those 10 minute waits before
    meetings, but I, too, will keep my books for truly enjoyable reading.

  body: This kind of stuff is just a fad. It&#39;ll go out like rock and roll and
    blue jeans. <BR> <BR>Seriously though, I&#39;d rather just sit and think about
    stuff than read on a cell phone screen.
