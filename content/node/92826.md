body: "Hi, well I'm trying to unite two letters but when doing so the final shape
  is distorted.\r\n What I did was converted the letters to Create Outlines. After
  that I selected both shapes and united them in the Pathfinder tab. The result was
  a distorted final shape.\r\n What can I do so it doesn't distort.\r\n\r\n Thanks."

  body: It should work fine as you did it - try it with a different font - it may
    have something to do with the structure of the glyphs in that specific font.

  body: "Never mind, I found the solution. Turns out I had to remove the check-mark
    beside Align New Objects to Pixel Grid in the mini menu of the Transform tab.\r\nHope
    this helps anyone having this problem.\r\nThanks anyway.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/resolved_6352.jpg]"
