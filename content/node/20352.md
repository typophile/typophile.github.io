body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI'm having some problems accessing the OpenType features in
  Meta Pro in Illustrator. I want to use small caps, but can't seem to find where
  to activate them. I know there is an OpenType palette within the Type palette in
  Illustrator, but there isn't a function to activate Small Caps. The only way I seem
  to be able to access them so far is through the Glyphs palette.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  can help me out it would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: It is an option off of the upper right triangle in the Character Palette -
    select Small Caps and then type non shifted letters for Small Caps - shifted for
    Full Caps

  body: "I should have mentioned I tried activating Small Caps like that as well,
    but they just seem to come out as faux Small Caps ie. All Caps scaled down. I
    did an experiment where I scaled a line of supposed Small Caps up to the size
    of the same line in All Caps and the glyphs were the same.\r\n\r\nLooks like I
    might have to contact FontShop.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway."

  body: Not sure if this will help, but I had a similar problem with Bello Pro with
    InDesign. I found that I had to have ligatures active in order to get the small
    caps to work.

  body: You have to go to preferences and change the dialog box on the percentage
    change of Caps to Small Caps it will never be true unless the typeface has been
    drawn in small caps

  body: Dan - FF Meta Pro, being an OpenType font with small caps, should work exactly
    as I described.

  body: Just a FYI. I contacted FontShop about my problem and they replied back saying
    that there are some irregularities with how Small Caps works with Meta Pro and
    that they will be addressing the issue.

    familiar. I recall having to have more than one feature on FontLab's OT panel,
    otherwise a single feature would not show up upon compiling."

  body: 'iota''s issue did indeed exist just as he said: CS/CS2 were not using using
    FF Meta Pro''s true small caps characters.  The newest rerelease of Meta Pro,
    which just dropped a couple weeks ago, resolves the issue.'
