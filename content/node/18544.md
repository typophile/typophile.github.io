  body: Negative leading is unreadable if you like unreadable text good for you but
    I prefer to get the content without the work. The point of text should be about
    content and not design unless its a design magazine. But there was a design magazine
    that wanted me to subscribe and they used negative leading on their subheads,
    I didn't subscribe

  body: Dan, this text is quite large in the magazine. I think display size use gets
    away with more than text size does or should.
