  little basic, sorry in advance.\r\n\r\nI am working on a OsF version from a font.
  Looking which characters \r\nuse to change from one style to the other I found in
  Adobe Jenson the next ones:\r\n\r\nnumbersign dollar percent zero one two three
  four five six seven eight nine cent sterling yen florin perthousand colonmonetary
  Euro\r\n\r\nBut I thought that probably there are some more characters \r\nthat
  should change at least in the vertical position, for example:\r\n\r\nMinus multiply
  less greater etc.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n. which is the recommended characters
  you should change in form or position\r\nto make a complete OsF font style?\r\n.
  is there any recommended link or tutorial for the correct way to write the otf replacement?\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance for your answers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDar\xEDo"

    a very subjective thing, I mean the desire to place some figures for old style
    use. You could also consider the small caps and what figures become too large
    when used with them."
