body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm very un-knowledgeable about type, but I'm trying to learn. I'm
  working on a new logo for my site, and I'm looking for a font with a ch ligature,
  which takes a similar form to the 18th century ct ligature I've read about. I'm
  looking at this sort of thing:\r\n\r\n[[http://skitch.com/echohelloworld/spud/chlig]]\r\n\r\nIt's
  only for one 4-letter word so I'd prefer not to spend a load of cash, but for the
  right font I'll splash out!\r\n\r\nOn another note, does anyone have any \"beginning
  typography\" type resources? This sort of thing fascinates me and I'd love to learn
  more!"

  body: Wow, that's awesome! Thanks very much. Is there a special name for the type
    of ch ligature I'm describing. [gross lack of technical knowledge coming:] the
    ones I've found always join at the bottom, not the top.

  body: "If you could find a font with a ck ligature (which I believe are more plentiful)
    you could then just use the upper part of the k stem and replace with the bottom
    of the h.  Or just draw it yourself, for four letters it seems a bit overkill.
    \ Then you can use any font.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina
