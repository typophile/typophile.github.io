  body: Hello. I have a collection of these, but I live in NYC, so it makes things
    easier. I suggest taking a walk around a larger city/urban area, especially a
    chinatown or any other where there is a language spoken other than English. I&#39;ve
    also noticed that driving around suburb/rural areas you can find these signs,
    but it will take more time. Good Luck!
