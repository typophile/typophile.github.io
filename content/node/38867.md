  X3. Other fonts do the same thing, only in their own special way. The text is still
  text and can be edited and it's wonkiness changes as size changes, getting less
  distorted as it gets larger and on the \"Clear Transformations\" command it shrinks
  down to an undistorted 1/10000 of an inch or so.\r\n \r\nthis isn't an issue for
  me, since any time I import an AutoCAD drawing to work on in Corel, I blow all the
  text away anyhow. I just thought it's kind of intriguing - Perhaps as an automatic
  grunge font generator. <em>AutoGRUNGE?</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mangledtext_6463.JPG]\r\n\r\nR"
