  body: I love the font...Not so sure about the symbol though. I can't tell what it's
    in the b&w version. The color version is kinda confusing too...yellow tongue?

  body: "is it a tongue or sauce?\r\n\r\nBoth. No problema betewen these two interpretations.
    In fact its a redesign project. Checkout the original one at www.kibehouse.com.br
    I tried keep the most critical element that were in the original design. Maybe
    cheese, mustard, yellow toungue or, whatever you associate with fastfood.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the symbol and work just with the tipography logotype.\r\nWhat do you think?"

    searching for something outside of its shell: not very appetizing.\r\n\r\nAs others
    have said, however, the type is well executed.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "It seems to me the opening could be more or less the shape of the tongue
    with it looping up into what appears to the the top of the bun (?) .\r\n\r\nAnd
    with the full-color shaded version you do have the advantage of being able to
    articulate the entire concept, but the 1-color version is where the problem needs
    to be solved.\r\n\r\nThe colors and textures are fun. But I still think the tongue
    needs to be solved first."
