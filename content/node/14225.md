  <a href=\"http://intvfunhouse.com/atari2600/parkerbros/box/rotj.jpg\">examples</a>?\r\n\r\nIt
  is a lighter weight of the Parker Brothers logo without the custom A and is used
  for most cover text on those boxes.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great, best I could
  find was the Neuzeit variations.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n"
