body: "Most business relationships are built upon trust. Unfortunately, when you are
  an artist, whether it be, designer, painter, photographer, etc. you have to learn
  to withhold your own trust.\r\n\r\nIn business school, business people are taught
  to buy their goods at the cheapest possible price, and barter for the lowest possible
  cost. This is the nature of their business. You can't hold it against them. That's
  just the way they are.\r\n\r\nWhat changes things in your perspective, as an artist
  , is that you are dealing with people that are lying to you straight faced and point
  blank about the value of your work, in order to save a few bucks. That's very disturbing
  when you realize this reality. Very disturbing, yet true. Most artists are very
  good, fair, honest people. Most business people are not.\r\n\r\nNever sell yourself
  short. And NEVER take their opinion seriously. Look at them, straight faced and
  seriously, and lie to them right back. Tell them how much you understand that they
  are right, and then proceed to do what you would have done anyway without their
  intervention.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it REALLY doesn't matter what they think
  because they are morons. Do the rest of us artists a service and ask for more money.
  You're worth it. Trust me.\r\n\r\n- Signed, a fellow artist"
