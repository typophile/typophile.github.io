  body: This is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/onyx_regular_ot/">Onyx</a>.
    It was designed by American Gerry Powell in 1937. Nothing too Mexican about it
    -- it's related to Bodoni, a French face -- but glad you found what you need.

  body: Well I know technically it is not a "mexican" typeface but you can't tell
    me for a second you wouldn't identify that L as chiseled. Since I was looking
    for a Bodoni it's gonna have a french/italian feel but the angled boldness of
    the capital letter serifs says latin to me. Thanks for the ID.

  body: I think this is the Wrong ID.  While Onyx is very close to the example above
    it does not have the angular cut of the L and the end of the lowercase e is round
    not flat like the example. Also the "e" counter is to narrow in Onyx. Any ideas
    if there is a different cut or something else similar, these sharp features are
    the parts of the face I like.

  body: What is the source of your sample? You have to realise that the transition
    to digital could be the cause of the differences. A classic example is Palatino
    where some details in the digital version are quite different from the original
    metal version.

    \r\n\r\nWouldn't that mean it's a digital typeface? Most of the site is set in
    it."
