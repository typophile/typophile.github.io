    - Galin, excuse me, but I can hardly see the &#34;X&#34;, it looks more like a
    an aeroplane or some strange flight device <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Thanks for your post, Ivan. The idea of the &#34;x&#34; is to represent a
    metaphor of an airplane, which is taking off. The other idea was to depict a cute
    figure in motion. <BR> <BR>Here are more variations.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53484.jpg"

  body: '#2 of course works, but I find it somewhat uninspiring. #3 is the only one
    we&#39;ve seen where the dancing guy/airplane reads like an &#34;x&#34;. Now try
    a variant where the &#34;learning center&#34; part is not in a script face, but
    a nice sans.'

    <BR>Of those two, #2 is very clear, though #3 is more fun...it doesn&#39;t quite
    read &#39;xam&#39; though. It&#39;s close. Maybe make the &#39;head&#39; a different
    color?'

  body: 'I think if it should look like an airplane than make it look like an airplane.
    If it should look like a man &#40; which is to me what it looks like&#41; than
    it should look more like a man. I am slightly frustrated with this inkblot type
    of logo design. Frustrated because in the end you end up with something that looks
    like too many things. This causes the company to have an indecisive look.  Indecision
    is bad. Confidence is good. I definatly feel that #3 is the most succesfull. But
    is still not there. What age group is the xam center targeting?'

  body: 'To Tanya : The assinments come from various of sources. I have some very
    powerful friends here in Bulgaria, who are in the same kind of business &#40;people
    from Ogilvy &amp; Mather, McCann Erickson, TBWA, Kres, etc.&#41;. They introduce
    me to potential clients and I have to work out the rest. ;&#41; &#40;the clients
    they give me are usually ones with money in their bank accounts, but I don&#39;t
    use my connections very often, because like everything goes : A favor for a favor.
    <BR> <BR>Note : The typical client is any incentive businessman, who needs to
    look professional. <BR>Unfortunately the profit is insufficient, because of the
    unwillingness of people to pay tantamount to the work that was done.  <BR>How
    would you react to a cost of 70$ for Corp.Id &#40;and 50$ for a logotype&#41;?  <BR>
    <BR>Of course, now and then, more generous clients come, but I believe you got
    the picture. <BR> <BR>Salute to all'

  body: 'Yes, I can confirm that every single word Galin wrote is true...we work for
    SUCH money. And Tanya: it&#39;s a normal workload for country, where words like
    &#34;brand&#34; or &#34;mark&#34; were some sort of gibberish 15 years ago. I
    can fully understand what Galin goes thru each &amp; every day, because I&#39;m
    a native Bulgarian too and I live &amp; work in here, not in USA, as Galin presumed.
    <BR> <BR>Galin: drop the khaki version. As for the envelope, do they plan to use
    it to send mail or this is SASE? And - heh, Kres doesn&#39;t mean anything for

  body: 'Galin - I like the look of it, but I&#39;m a sucker for dancing figures.
    I&#39;m not sure why the airplane is relevant - is it just to show aspiration
    and rising to meet challenges or is there some reason to hold onto the airplane
    symbol. If not then maybe concentrate on the dancing figure and X within the mark.
    Adding that third requirement of the glyph increases its workload dramatically.
    If it is important however - then I think the configuration of #3. It feels very
    young - but I think the playfulness could still work. I like the idea someone
    had of simplifying learning center - it needs to form a good base for the figure
    to dance upon. <BR> <BR>As far as # of corporate IDs a year it depends on the
    firm. I work in a small department that gets a great deal of its work from small
    to medium business &#40;under 1.5mil&#41; and some work from larger. As a result
    I get a great deal of Identities &#40;at least 10-15 a year&#41; sometimes they
    aren&#39;t of a very high level, but its good experience.'
