  body: Even if it's not it, can't stop thinking about [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033|Archer]]
    (misleading /a and /y with their ball terminals). The rest is far from Archer,
    more like a rounded ([[http://www.themomiverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Company-Store-Stacked-Simple.jpg|a
    closer look here]] to see the roundness) [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/rockwell/|Rockwell]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-slabserif-712/|Geometric
    Slabserif 712]]. May be they simply start from it, tweaked /a and /y and manually
    round the whole thing.

  body: Yes, Ryuk. This is a rounded edit of Rockwell(most) + Archer (a & y). Thank
    you. I thought is was all one font because of the rounding, but is a special edit
    for the logo.
