  body: Gah, that is such an ugly neometalblackforestgothesque logo. Straight out
    of the CorelDraw palette of envelope tools. Blech.

  body: What I&#39;ve got trouble with is the Nazi iconography that keeps  <BR>popping
    up. I know most of the time it&#39;s not intended as such,  <BR>but iron crosses
    freak me out. <BR> <BR>Envelopes suck big time. Distortion by photocopier is way
    kewl.

  body: Honestly, Tom, if you can&#39;t convince the client that the point of identity
    design is to create a unique IDENTITY, I would not take the gig. Sometimes the
    money is not worth your soul... that&#39;s just my opinion though. Nothing new
    under the sun, I understand, but a straight rip-off turns you into a mere hack
    with a computer and not a designer. Hope that doesn&#39;t sound too harsh...
