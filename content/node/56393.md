body: "It's been a few years since we last refreshed our website, and with the growth
  of our own Exclusives library, some sections had become burgeoning with information,
  but unjustifaibly hidden away.\r\n\r\nOur fresh new design, with revised site structure
  and navigation, allows us to bring key tools, such as an opportunity to try out
  our fonts with TypoGFX, and key resources, such as our Exclusives library and project
  portfolio, to the fore.\r\n\r\nOur library is now the primary reason that many of
  you visit our site, so we're proud to show it off to the full. It's a vital resource
  for many modifications and customizations, so please do contact us if you would
  like to discuss the possibilities for something off-the-shelf, something modified,
  or even a brand new custom commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso check out our latest font
  releases: Lexia Ad, Plume Ad and Verveine.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag"
