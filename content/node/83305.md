body: I'm pretty sure this will be an easy one for somebody. All I have is this jpeg
  and I need to create a vector for work, just trying to save myself some pen tool
  work. The tagline looks like Impact, but the acronym is not quite right. Anyone
  know what that part is?

  body: The small font is impact, but the larger font is slightly different. Is it
    just a variation of Impact?
