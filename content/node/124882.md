  posts to existing topics, but I cannot create a new topic.  When I try to create
  a new topic, I always get \u201C500 Internal Server Error\u201D.  It is like that
  on different computers at different locations.\r\n\r\nI had to create a new account
  to create this topic. This is my regular account with which it is impossible to
  create new topics:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/user/7800\r\n\r\nIs there anything that
  can be done about it?  Who can I contact to get help?  I have already contacted
  Chris Dean, Jared Benson and itadmin@punchcut.com, and I have used the contact form
  at http://typophile.com/feedback, but have not received any answer."
