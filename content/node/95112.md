  when trying to identify fonts that are too decorative or scripty, so I'm hoping
  the good folks here can help me out. \r\n\r\nI'm uploading a few images of some
  fonts I'm interested in identifying for some projects. Any help would be greatly
  appreciated. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ravioli_4167.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview_3942.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview-2_5165.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview-4_4133.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tile-1_6161.jpeg]"
