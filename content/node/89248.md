body: "Afternoon all,\r\n\r\nNot a design question as such but it is a gnarly issue
  that I could do with some pointers on.\r\n\r\nI have to layout a 4-8 page section
  of a magazine which consists of a product guide. Mostly text with the occasional
  image and/or logo.\r\n\r\nThe data for the entries is collected on a web form and
  extracted (and arrives with me) as an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet contains
  an awful lot of data I don't need (date, IP address etc) as well as the company
  name, product details and contact info.\r\n\r\nI have been told I can outsource
  this task if need be and I am happy to do that (although I have no idea to whom,
  ideas please?) but in the meantime I would love to find out what methods are available
  to me to get what I need from Excel into InDesign (or Quark, I have both and am
  not fussy which) preferably tagged so the formatting required is minimal.\r\n\r\nI
  know it is possible \u2013 I designed the election night special for the last four
  UK general elections and received, from the Press Association, when the majority
  of seats were declared an RTF file which I simply streamed into my Quark design.
  All I needed to do was ensure no widows or orphans and my job was done!\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any experience of doing such an operation, or know of a company that
  I can farm the task out to?"

  body: Export the Excel document to a comma-delimited or tab-delimited text file
    (save as). Then import the file into InDesign via "data merge." This feature is
    designed to do exactly what you need. Look up a tutorial.
