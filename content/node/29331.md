body: "Can anyone suggest some possible substitutions I can use to get a take on the
  Psycho movie poster?\r\n\r\nI need both a version of the thinline movie typeface
  and a block lettering I can use to somewhat recreate this.  The tear through the
  lettering of course is not important.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty informal thing I need
  to design quickly though--reasonably close approximations of what I can use for
  this is more than fine.\r\n\r\nThanks!  "

  body: I actually created a whole font "Psycho (1960).ttf" based on just the 6 cracked
    letters of the movie logo. Have a look at this example and tell me what you think.
