  that might be offered in the Seattle area. Does anyone know of a local type designer
  that might be willing take a rookie under their wing for a brief apprenticeship?
  \ I am currently in Seattle, but would be willing to travel over the summer if there
  are good suggestions. Thanks--"

    to Seattle in August and always features some great one-day workshops.

  body: "Can't think of anyone specific in Seattle, but you should visit the <a href=\"www.schoolofvisualconcepts.com\">School
    of Visual Concepts</a>. They have letterpress classes and other kinds of design
    programs, but they also have cool workshops, etc. SVC is going to be involved
    in Typecon, so that's a good resource to look into.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind Canada,
    Jim Rimmer in Vancouver, BC has open invitations for people to come visit him
    in his shop. I haven't had a chance yet, but it's something I have on my list
    of things to do.\r\n\r\nIf this is something that Thomas Phinney would be up to,
    I think it would be great to be able to visit Adobe also. Sign me up for that
    one. \r\n\r\nIf you can't find anything specific, I'm not a type designer, but
    I'm always down for grabbing a pint!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the leads...I will see what I can find out about Jim Rimmer's studio.
    That could be an interesting fieldtrip.  I am excited about the TypeCon this summer.
    It sounds like fun!
