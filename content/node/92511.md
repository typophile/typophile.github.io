body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a way to create striped drop shadows on typography
  in Illustrator, but haven't found a way to do it properly.\r\nI've attached an example
  of what I'm trying to do. You'll notice that the stripes are always equally spaced
  end to end and always start on a full stripe.\r\nThe example is from Tiboro Design.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    behind it with the blend tool in illustrator (with very small steps) or make the
    shape manually.\r\n\r\nI suspect the example was done manually, to get the words
    perfectly in line with the 'shadow' though."

  body: "My guess would be a mask layer was created and the stripes were drawn behind
    it. Basically, you have to copy the glyph outlines and adjust them to cover the
    entire \"3d\" area and then use that shape to define your clipping mask. \r\n\r\nAt
    least that's what I did to make this: [[http://jtodddesign.com/graphic_design/images/acposter3.jpg]]"
