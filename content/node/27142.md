    <BR><i>Metro International <BR>&#40;...&#41; <BR>With this redesign, the newspaper
    is saying good-bye to one  <BR>half of the original Metro typography from 1995.
    A new sans  <BR>serif font, named Corpid and designed by Lucas de Groot  <BR>of
    the Netherlands, will replace Franklin Gothic and Agenda.  <BR>Corpid is to be
    used for headlines as well as for logos, captions,  <BR>fact boxes, quotes, etc.
    For the news section, Lucas de Groot  <BR>has developed a high contrast version
    of Corpid which will be  <BR>used exclusively by the Metro newspapers all over
    the world.  <BR>The body typeface, Gerard Ungers Swift, will stay untouched.</i>'

  body: What I actually was looking for was <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26775.html"
    target="_blank"> this</a>, as you made yourself the  <BR>Frutiger connection.
    I haven&#39;t found any other source claiming the  <BR>Frutiger &#34;influence&#34;
    unfortunately. I know there&#39;s some controversy <BR>about TheSerif/PMN Caecilia
    and Corpid/Frutiger -- unjustly so in  <BR>my opinion -- and I&#39;m interested
    in finding some more information.

  body: Thanks Peters.  <BR>I suggested Frutiger because at teh first glance, it looks
    vaguely inspired by that, but so are many other new sans serif fonts
