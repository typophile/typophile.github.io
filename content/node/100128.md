    curved), very generic (non distinctive, even boring to me) and too few letters.

    don\u2019t think so. But Harabara is a modification of Helvetica Bold."

    since Harabara itself most likely involved outline theft (as Jan kindly hints
    at).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, if all you need to set is \"quipio\" then I would start with a rendering
    of Futura or Avant Garde and modify away. If you need a whole font, and you're
    up to making the effort, modify Futura or Avant Garde, just make totally sure
    it never leaves your hard drive.\r\n\r\nBTW, using a plagiarized font isn't plagiarism
    itself; it's just... inconsiderate.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
