  FontFeed]] helping to id the type used in Valkyrie, but i would like to know if
  the title type is a font or lettering. \r\n\r\nYou can see the first 6 mins over
  at Apple:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/mgm/valkyrie/\r\n\r\nIf anyone has
  seen the movie and can remember what the type used for the ending credits was, i
  would love to know. i can't find a vid/pic of it online.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n"
