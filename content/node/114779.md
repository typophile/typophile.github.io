  twin sister :)\r\n\r\nI've attached the original letter, the Corsiva example, and
  a superimposed one.\r\nPlease note the letters have been stretched, yes, but even
  stretched, the Corsiva does not match 100% : the leg and foot are different.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  up for this challenge ?\r\nSandra :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/original_3519.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monotype_4577.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/superimposed_3912.jpg]"
