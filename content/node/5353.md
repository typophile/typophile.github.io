  body: Hi, Tobias. <BR> <BR>I like your typeface, but I&#39;m not too sure about
    the lowercase <b>f</b>; I thought it was a <b>t</b>, at first... I notice now
    that you&#39;ve done something similar with the descenders of <b>g</b> and <b>y</b>
    &#40;is that the confusion you mention?&#41;... Although the <b>y</b> looks like
    a <b>y</b>, the <b>g</b> &#42;could&#42; be confused with an <b>a</b>, I think...
    <BR> <BR>You may want to try extending the <b>f</b>&#39;s ascender and the descenders
    of <b>g</b> and <b>y</b>... it doesn&#39;t have to be a lot -- try making a few
    different versions of the <b>f</b>, for example, with varying lengths of ascender,
    and let your eye decide which works best. &#40;This is a method I learned from
    <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/">Briem&#39;s website</a>, and it has been of
    great help to me.&#41; <BR> <BR>Best wishes!

  body: hmmm... in the above post, when I said, &#34;it doesn&#39;t have to be a lot&#34;,
    I meant to add &#34;but it does have to be enough that the <b>f</b> is sufficiently
    different from the <b>t</b>&#34;...

  body: 'Niiice. <BR> <BR>In the lc the only things I might change are the beaks of
    &#34;f&#34; and &#34;r&#34;: make the former&#39;s stronger, and try shearing
    both of them vertically. <BR> <BR>In the UC, the &#34;E&#34; and &#34;F&#34; should
    be narrower, and the &#34;L&#34; seems too dark. <BR> <BR>And in the numerals,
    the &#34;8&#34; isn&#39;t working. <BR> <BR>I like the &#34;&amp;&#34;! <BR> <BR>Spacing:
    maybe a little tighter overall, and a hair more blank space. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Thanks, that must be some kind of record. I agree with what you are saying..
    About the numerals, you dont think they should be lighter, considering they are
    narrower?

  body: What is this, a setup? :-&#41; <BR>It&#39;s hard to tell looking at converted-to-outline
    type, but yes, the numerals do seem a bit dark. In fact so do the caps, but only
    by a hair. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
