body: Is there a Futura with non-lining figures? Or a Futura-like typeface with OSF?
  I&#39;ve seen it before in a book but can&#39;t find anything. <BR> <BR>Thanks,
  <BR> <BR>Kevin

    has lots of Futura variations, including non-lining figures. &#40;I&#39;d link
    directly to the sample page, but the site uses frames so I can&#39;t.&#41;
