body: Please help me identify this pretty serif logo font, used on the cover of a
  new graphic novel. It seems similar to both Garamond-like and Charlemagne-like fonts.
  Letter E resembles CharleMagne, Barry Gothic etc, but R is specific and unusual.
  I understand this logo may be created in a vector graphic editor, but there must
  be a font it's based on. I guess this ornamented O is more probably a product of
  graphic design, but may it be some decorative font too?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dragons
