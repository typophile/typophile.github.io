    /H, /A, /N and /Y: some Egyptian like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/rockwell|Rockwell]]
    might work; /A off but [[https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/chunk|Chunk]]
    might work as well;\r\n- /T, /K, /O and /U: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Impact|Impact]]
    might work, stretching /K and /T though;\r\n"
