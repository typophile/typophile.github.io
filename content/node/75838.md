  are the lines in the letters part of the font or did someone draw these in? \r\n\r\nI
  have never seen a font quite like this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

  body: "The font looks like Poster Bodoni, or a similar heavy Bodoni. I think the
    lines are an add-on/overlay to make a flag-like logo design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I think Mike is right.  Looks like someone used the type as a cookie-cutter
    over that texture.  I have used that technique often in AI. It is just using the
    type as outlines as a clipping mask over some other piece of art.

  body: I've seen that somewhere before. It is the exact same font as the "United
    States of America" in my US passport and the lines look a lot like the small lines
    as security features in several documents produced by the Bureau of Engraving
    and Printing.
