  be in Russian, but Trajan Pro, which is used on the piece, has no Cyrillic characters.
  Suggestions for a close match? I'd rather not just set it in all caps Garamond Pro,
  which is my fallback.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    that it covers Central European. I guess it's Font Font that holds its Pro fonts

  body: No, "Premier" is part of the typeface name of Garamond Premier. There's no
    other such thing as a Premier Pro font, afaik.

  body: "@hrant\r\nThose are some mighty fine threads there. The question about Trajanic
    Cyrillics is one of perspective:\r\na) Should a designer draw it as the Romans
    would have drawn it had they had Cyrillic? or \r\nb) Draw it according to what
    modern expectations or standards say it should look like? or\r\nc) Make it match
    the rest of the glyphs, tradition or expectations be damned?"
