body: Hi there, <BR>I wonder what type was used to create the logo of LOEWE company?  <BR>
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33919.jpg" alt=""> <BR>
  <BR>It is of course no Futura. Some custom lettering maybe, or?... &#40;The &#34;O&#34;
  is very unusual, maybe it is a ZERO? Also the square shape of the full stop dot
  is quite unusual with this shape of letters, i think&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thank you for
  any ideas/suggestions. <BR> <BR>Peter

  body: You can get some of that O&#39;s square-sidedness in FF Din. But the Es don&#39;t
    match -- not that it would be terribly difficult to drag out the middle arm. <BR>

  body: To me it has the &#34;feel&#34; of ITC Avant Garde Gothic Condensed, but I
    don&#39;t know of any weight that bold. Maybe the MM version was used, or it&#39;s
    a custom design?

  body: I agree with Metadox that this looks very much like  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/bold/testdrive.html?s=L0EWE.&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> ITC Avant Garde Gothic</a> Bold&#40;er&#41; with the O subsituted  <BR>for
    a zero.

    have those traps. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34021.jpg"

  body: Closer and closer. Good eye Tiff, I didn&#39;t go that far  <BR>into details.
    It&#39;s not a zero though, the sides are  <BR>still a bit elliptical, not straight.

  body: although even that isn&#39;t a match. even adding a .25 stroke and stretching
    it ... the counters don&#39;t match.

  body: yeah, the shape is just different... man, where is that O from?? I s&#39;pose
    it could have just been drawn  in Illustrator or whatnot. maybe the designer was
    shocked by the circular O from Avant Garde and decided to make his own.

    thank you everybody for your effort.'
