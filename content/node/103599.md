body: "I'm working with a vendor who has delivered a font that looks almost exactly
  like \"Font X\" that Adobe owns and sells. This font will be used by several of
  our vendors to create packaging, signage, collateral, etc. \r\n\r\nOur vendor claims
  the font is a complete re-drawing of Adobe's Font X based on his own Font Y. Therefore
  this is not a pirated font. When I compare the outlines, I see the majority of the
  outlines exactly match Font X, with one or two points adjusted to make the serifs
  longer and the rounds wider.\r\n\r\nOur company is committed to maintaining proper
  font licensing. We have had worked with several foundries that have allowed us to
  alter their fonts with the promise that we either purchase additional licenses or
  pay a flat fee AND that all our vendors must license the original font before using
  the altered font. We've tried contacting Adobe but either get put on hold for hours
  or transferred to someone who cannot answer our question.\r\n\r\n1. Should I assume
  that Adobe will not allow this since their EULA is pretty clear?\r\n2. Does anyone
  have a contact at Adobe who understands my question and can give me a definitive
  answer?\r\n3. Does anyone have a link to language that I can pick up to share with
  my partners an explain why having similar outlines would violate our license?\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate your help."

  body: "Adobe has long allowed modifications, but the modified fonts must be licensed
    just like the originals.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, not all Adobe fonts are the same in this
    regard. See http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/additional-license-rights.html
    \ and look for which fonts have the \"3\" note, and also consider the date the
    license was done. Sigh.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thomas is right. Standard caveat: I have never attended law school. I've
    worked a lot with a handful of lawyers on matters related to type & fonts, but
    if you have legal questions you may want to consult a real lawyer.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, it certainly sounds as though your vendor is violating Adobe's license (presuming
    they licensed it from Adobe in the first place) by distributing their modification.\r\n\r\nThere's
    a separate kind of potential violation here as well: Adobe applies for design
    patents on pretty much all of its original designs, and distributing a modification
    under another name would be a patent violation. Some of the patents have expired
    with time, and a few were never applied for, but this does sound dicey. If you
    want to contact me directly and tell me the name of the typeface in question I
    can tell you whether it has a current patent.\r\n\r\nAnd in case that's not enough,
    there may also be copyright violations involved. In the U.S. that's limited to
    the software (which includes the outline points); in various European countries
    it also covers the designs.\r\n\r\nI'll offer two opinions, for what they're worth.\r\n1)
    \ Your vendor may well be violating one or more laws, and is either unethical
    or clueless. If you feel you need to retain a business relationship with these
    folks, watch your back. \r\n2)  If you use the modified font only in the vendor's
    projects and per their direction, I suspect any legal liability rests with them,
    not you.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for asking!\r\nDavid L"

  body: "Thanks so much for your responses. This is the information I need to take
    back to my partners and explain why we are rejecting this font. \r\n\r\nTo be
    clear: no one has distributed the font yet. This is part of a proposed creative
    campaign from an outside ad agency. The agency came up with the idea and hired
    a freelancer to alter the font without consulting us. Now they will learn how
    foolish that was.\r\n\r\nI suppose the agency could use the font on another campaign
    in the future since they've paid for the work. If I see it showing up one day,
    I'll be sure to let Adobe know!\r\n\r\n"
