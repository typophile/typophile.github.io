  body: "I agree with Seb. The italic 'g' is not Jenson, and it does look like Caslon.
    However, I have not been able to find a Caslon Swash that has this exact S, although
    the R matches well enough in [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=LFT1075400#characters|Caslon
    540]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Caslon</a> also has similar swashes.
