body: "Hi all, I'm returning here to seek your help after a long absence.\r\n\r\nThis
  sans-serif font has many distinctive features, so many that I'd think identifying
  it would be a snap. However, I've spent hours poring over identifont and various
  catalogs and specimens and I haven't been able to identify it. Here's a representative
  sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VLCScreenSnapz001_6540.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is a frame grab from a video of a PowerPoint presentation (long story). I actually
  have the PowerPoint document but none of the fonts it claims it uses match this
  font. I've unpacked the file and it looks like there are some fonts embedded in
  the document. I think these are encrypted, though, so I can't extract any information
  from them, even the names.\r\n\r\nCan someone help? Thanks!\r\n"

  body: "Ha! Very interesting, thanks. They were right under my nose. (Well, not really,
    as I'm a Mac guy.) I found a Windows 7 system to check out and they're there all
    right. The documents came from a Windows system and had specified some other font,
    but possibly through misconfiguration or transferring between systems that didn't
    have the font installed, the documents ended up using this system font.\r\n\r\nIt's
    somewhat startling to see an interesting Latin font buried within a non-Latin
    font. From what I've seen the Latin characters of non-Latin fonts are usually
    a copy of something else (like Arial) or are some fairly uninteresting design.
    Kind of cool to find this hidden gem. It would be interesting to do a survey of
    other non-Latin fonts to see what Latin character designs might be there.\r\n\r\nAlso
    interesting that this design has apparently never appeared in a Latin font. At
    least, not one that any of the ones that I've run across.\r\n\r\nTo kthomps5,
    thanks for the link to whatfontis.com. I had tried WhatTheFont at myfonts.com
    but it didn't find it.\r\n\r\nI note that Sakkal Majalla has a regular and a bold
    variant. My sample is the bold. The regular looks pretty nice, too. See also:
