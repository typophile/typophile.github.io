  body: Dino - I think that the other is more closely derived from the Image Club
    font <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/broadband/" target="_blank">Broadband</a>.

  body: "Yes, Broadband was the one I was thinking but it\u2019s not a match either.
    This could be a freefont which combines Insignia and Broadband."

  body: "Okay it came out wrong. What I meant was you still need to modify Broadband
    to get the exact same \u201Cfont\u201D. So I thought there might be a knockoff,
    which of course isn\u2019t worth hunting down."

  body: Oh right, of course. My take on it is that if the more complex character shapes
    match and the simpler ones are only slightly different, my bets are on it being
    a modification.
