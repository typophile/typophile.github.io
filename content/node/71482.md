body: "Came across these old pics of a building from the 1880s, curious to know what
  font this might be. I really don't know anything about fonts, but through a little
  research i thought Baskervilles and Bodoni's looked a little similar, though that
  very square E is throwing me off. Any ideas?\r\n"

  body: "Because these windows are hand-made, talking about 'fonts' is out of place.
    Even talking of typefaces may be meaningless, because the artist might have drawn
    his own letterforms, as well as he may have used an existing typeface model. Both
    of the typefaces you mentioned would have been in existence before the 1880s,
    so they could be possible choices. The degree of contrast may suggest something
    more like Bodoni, except the serif is bracketed on the N, and most Bodonis I think
    are not bracketed serifs. There would probably be many candidates, such as Scotch
    Roman, or Caslon, or even the Baskerville you suggested.\r\n\r\nI cannot see the
    letter for your East image, so the only letter I saw was the N. Difficult for
    me to make a guess from that, although someone else may feel more confident.\r\n\r\n-
