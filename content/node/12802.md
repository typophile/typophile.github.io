    of living issue... The price of FF Scala (single weight) is 40 euros also for
    Italy and other Euro-Zone countries. FontFont have a pricing policy based on the
    equation 1 Euro = 1 Dollar. In fact the euro is much stronger against the dollar
    (check www.xe.com) so European FontFont customer pay more for the same stuff ):\r\nIn
    my opinion their pricing policy is not fair.\r\n\r\nWhat if a European customer
    buy online directly from FontFont US?\r\n\r\n "

    unfair about selling a product for a different amount in different markets.\r\nIt
    is a marketing strategy -- take it or leave it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, fonts are
    underpriced in the US market, which is why FontFont has to cut its prices to participate
    there. This is not news, but has been happening since before e-commerce.  \r\n\r\n>it
    is not a cost of living issue\r\n\r\nOf course it is. Otherwise known as standard
    of living. Companies set product prices for particular countries based on what
    the local conditions are. They charge what they think the market will bear. \r\n\r\nFor
    instance, Quark XPress wil cost you \xA3700 in the UK, $1000 in the US.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    graphic designers make a lot more money in the UK than they do in the US!"

    even healthy. Although I think cost-of-living is only one factor at play here,
    another big one being Keeping Things Simple, like in not having a different price
    for every single country/state/village. That said, piss off an honest person enough

    about 37k in the UK. According to <a href=\"http://www.homefair.com/homefair/servlet/ActionServlet?pid=246&previousPage=245&cid=homefair&fromSalary=50000&fromCity=718&toCity=657\">

    is about equal to 25.5K in Idaho. Though fonts cost the same both places. So I'd
    have to agree with the orginal post that it isn't fair. That being said, I agree
    with hrant that they're probably just trying to keep it simple. "

    FontShop pricing policy. I wanted to spent some money buying some FF fonts last
    year but I decided not to do so. \r\n\r\nThey answered my angry email: \"you are
    right that the price difference is quite a lot at the moment due to the US exchange
    rate to Euro. But I hope you understand that we cannot change our prices every
    time the exchange rates differ. So since the official currency in Europe is Euro,
    european customers are charged in Euro.\" But official currency in my country
    is not Euro...\r\n\r\nI decided to ask my friend in the US to buy the fonts for
    me. FontShop allows this: \"...he is able to enter a 'licensee' name which can
    differ from his own, resp. from the adress of the person/company who pays for
    the fonts. Then you are the official licensee of the fonts.\""

  body: "Software vendors (let's say Adobe) usually sell the same product (let's say
    Photoshop) at different prices in different countries but the software they sell
    in Italy, France, etc. is localized (translated in Italian, French). Instead fonts
    are a universal product; there is no need for traslation or other adaptments (we
    are not speaking of CE, turkish or baltic version). FontFont should sell their
    fonts from a unique web site at a unique price automatically translated in Euros,
    Dollars, etc.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that cost of living is not a valid explication
    of FontFont pricing policy. Fonts cost the same (40 euros) in all European countries
    (UK, France, Italy, Greece, Albany, Bulgary, Poland, Ungary, Spain, etc.) Of course
    most European countries have a cost of living lower than US, where fonts sell
    for 40 dollars.\r\n\r\nFontFont is a private firm: they can sell their fonts at
    whatever price they like. However, considering current exchange rates, they are
    not playing fair with European customers.\r\n\r\n"

    companies, such as amazon, sell the same product at different prices in different

    forget: the customer is free to choose  where to buy. Most European customers
    are currently buying books directly from amazon.com (not from their European satellites)

    a unique price in dollar wordwide </strong>. Let the credit card companies convert

    always reflects the market it's intended for.\r\n\r\nIn countries where a dollar
    equals a day's wages, commodities will have lower prices than in the US or Europe.
    Luxury items in these countries, though, are a different story. There is a small
    market for them, cost of support, marketing etc. is high, hence luxury goods will
    be more expensive!\r\n\r\nAs for the European market: it can not be compared to
    the USA (and Canada). It is not one market, in the sense that marketing has to
    be done in a lot of different languages, localisation (not only language but also
    ways of distribution) adds to cost, and so on. For one FontShop in Northern America
    there are SEVERAL in Europe!\r\n\r\nThe point can be made that fonts are more
    of a commodity in the States (\"5000 fonts for $50 !\") and more of a luxury item
    in the rest of the world. And that's reflected in the pricing.\r\n"
