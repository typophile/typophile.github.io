body: "Hello. \r\n\r\nA redesign of a logo for Malvern House college. An 'English
  as a foreign language' teaching college with three big schools in London and numerous
  affiliated colleges around the world. The redesign was really just a tightening
  up and standardising of their current logo, which is the words (Malvern House) and
  a globe symbol - dull I know!\r\n\r\nThe attached example was one of several 'you
  could do something like this' proposals. The idea was to take the initials (M h)
  and turn them into 'houses'. I quite like it but it's not quite right, it's not
  really 'happening'. Maybe it's too literal? I dunno, It just seems a little clumsy
  to me.\r\n\r\nSo if any of you could give me some starting points to turn it into
  something decent I'd be eternally grateful.\r\n\r\nThe type is still being discussed
  (!) but it will be similar to what's shown; simple sans, nicely spaced, nothing
  tricksy.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mh_4614.jpg]"

    need to shoehorn an h into it.

    & mimic some of the aspects of the type and work them into the mark.\r\n\r\ngood

  body: "Ok, thanks for that. \r\n\r\nJustin; Yes, I think you're right, my early
    versions were just the house/M shape so I've gone back to those. \r\n\r\nVictor/Luca;
    Because it's a college that teaches English, it was felt to be really important
    not to have anything other than the straight-forward u/lc type. No visual tricks,
    not even setting the words in caps.\r\n\r\nSee what you think to these;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MHx2_4406.gif]"

  body: FWIW I think all marks have this very industrial feel. A factory block. Add
    thick smoke from the chimney and it'd be a logo for the 19th century industrial
    revolution :)

  body: "There's no relationship between the icon and the type. Try pairing your mark
    with a font that reflects the angle between the two buildings. Something like
    Gill Sans or Nobel (there are plenty of others, find something you believe is
    well suited) -  where the \"v\"  part of the cap \"M\" (I'm sure that has a name
    but at the moment I'm drawing a blank) doesn't extend down to the baseline. The
    font would then mimic the angle created by the two red buildings You may also
    want to consider something extended.\r\n\r\nGood luck with the project.\r\n"

  body: "What if you just had the outline of the two roofs form a M?  That seems like
    it would tie in better with it being more about language than houses.  I am thinking

  body: I'm going to have to disagree with those who say use only an M. I think the
    two separate buildings subtly and cleverly point to M and H. The type doesn't
    necessarily need to reflect all of the exact qualities of the mark, but there
    shouldn't be a disconnect between the two. If you use an M (in Malvern) with sloping
    vertical strokes as opposing to the parallel ones there are now, that would more
    closely reflect the qualities of the roofs and tie logo together better. Also,
    give the mark a shot with some roof overhang.

  body: "Thanks People\r\n\r\nKirs10; As I said the type is still under review and
    Gill is certainly a favourite but more for the fact that it is a very 'English'
    typeface. I was trying to get to where I was happy with the mark first. It's no
    good finding a face to reflect a mark that keeps changing!\r\n\r\nLuma; I had
    this shape in one of my early layout pad pages together with its 'h' equivalent.
    And it's a good point about the language being more important than the name. But
    I was worried it was too much like the Shelter logo (a housing charity)\r\n\r\nSteven;
    Thanks for the comments about the 'h'. But (again) the wording has to be straightforward
    and if that means a 'disconnect' then so be it. \r\n\r\nI'll keep on it... "
