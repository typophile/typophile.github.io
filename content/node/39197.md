  so I'd like to know what\r\nthis is; and I have a feeling it'll be a breeze for
  you hounds...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Karastan_6680.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Welcome back Hrant. \r\n\r\nYeah, that lower case is superb, one of the better
    realizations of the calligraphic feel in roman type. I wonder why Gills, who also

  body: I love Gills' work, especially <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/figural/">Figural</a>.
    Last I spoke with him (about the surprising resurgence of his Fling, thanks to
    Martha Stewart's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/162758504/"><em>Blueprint</em>
    mag logo</a>) he said he wants to get back into it and has some ideas on the table.
    But that was nearly a year ago.
