  going on in a playing card?\r\nThe ace, bicycle font and the copy at the bottom
  as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for playing!\r\nLiz\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card_3429.jpeg]"

    there's a free font called \"Bicycle\" which you might find to be of some help,

    font called LHF Bill Blake comes to mind, but you might find better.\r\n"
