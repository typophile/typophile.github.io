  for SEED magazine (take a moment to flip through it, if you haven't already), and
  we could use a hand IDing the typefaces used within. You can check out the magazine's
  website at http://www.seedmagazine.com, and the printed content at http://flickr.com/photos/seedmagazine/.
  Thanks so much for any help!\r\n"

  body: "I think the reason you have had no replies is because your question seems
    too open-ended. You would get answers if you showed us samples of specific type
    you wanted to have ID'd. Who knows whether what we see on the web page is anything
    like what is in the printed magazine?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
