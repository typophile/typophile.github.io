  body: "Armavia is the Armenian airline. There's no way it's custom.  :-)\r\n\r\nOne
    avenue would be to search for freely downloadable Armenian fonts, because they
    typically come with English in the encoding (in fact in the main ASCII-7 position)
    and typically the sans fonts are derived from Arial, or -shudder- an imitation
    of Arial.\r\n\r\nBTW, here's a detail of a shot I took at Schiphol in October:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Armavia_4656.jpg]\r\nYou
    can see (not really, I guess) some Arialesque Armenian text below the \"A\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Looks very much like Adobe Sans, the new default font when the proper outlines
    are not embedded properly. That used to be Courier and thus obvious, but Adobe
    Sans (and Serif) make such a good job at mimicking the real typeface that most
    people never notice. It takes the width from the real font and just makes the
    generic outlines fit the same space as the intended font. I have a large collection
    of these replacements which seem to happen a lot in a non-PostScript environment,
    like on plotters and vinyl-cutting machines. Vans and trucks and shop windows
    show more Adobe Sans than printed paper. As do airplanes, apparently.
