body: "I've tried to give my critique on a couple of critiques and now I need advice
  for mine! This is my first real resume.  I am not yet using it to search for a full-time
  job, but will use it pretty soon to send off as a plea for an internship position
  this summer. \r\n\r\nI'm especially concerned about, well, the typographical aspect
  of the resume, as I've only had about  6 weeks so far of formal education in the
  subject.  That said, any constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the website address and the email adress, and maybe reduce a wee bit the size
    of '@' with some positive kerning on its sides.\r\nThe titles aligned right could
    be all caps in smaller size and with more letterspace."

  body: "Alessandro, thank you for your suggestions. The red line lines up in inDesign
    and when the PDF is viewed at 300%.. I tried tweaking them a bit more and it looks
    better this time, I think.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have added a 2nd version to the first
    post."

  body: "The red line still isn't lining up, since you can\u2019t dictate the viewer\u2019s
    preferences, perhaps it would be simpler to outline the characters and pull the
    serif of the g out. I would look for some kind of alignment/relationship between
    header and copy, first I would re-position the copy slightly to the left and move
    it slightly down and then experiment with the positioning of your name and address
    details. Bearing in mind this could be printed out, the light grey used for the
    text might be too light/halftoned. At a closer view maybe you can work on the
    kerning of dashes, virgules and hyphens. Content-wise should the pre-College courses
    be included in education? I would remove the comma after Illustrator.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with the hunt.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "\u2003The baseline of the faked\u2013small-caps section headings is inconsistently
    aligned with the text to its left; \u2018EXPERIENCE\u2019 shares the baseline
    while the others float a bit.\u2002The fontshop.com entry for Rockwell Std Light
    suggests the font \u201Cmay include small caps, extra glyphs, and other features\u201D,
    so the `real' small caps might be worth hunting for.\u2002(<em>E.T.A:\u2002According
    to MyFonts.com, Rockwell does </em>not<em> have a small-caps version, so ignore
    that last bit.</em>)\r\n\r\n\u2003I know Bringhurst doesn't like it, but in text

    you suggest removing the comma, do you mean to use the \u201Ca, b and c\u201D
    convention (rather than \u201Ca, b, and c\u201D) or are you simply noting that
    it looks awkward in this context?\u2002I'd suggest keeping the comma and using
    an ampersand.\r\n\r\n\u2003Finally, I'm not sure what the standard camera naming

  body: "Hi, thanks Tim and Joel for your comments. They will be helpful, but I haven't
    had time yet to update.\r\n\r\nTim, thanks for the comments especially re: positioning.
    As far as pre-college's placement in education or experience.. I think one could
    argue that education is experience or that experience is education. They could
    be placed in either category, I think, but to keep with an easier timeline I chose
    to put the pre-college stuff under experience. \r\n\r\nJoel, my section headings
    are not fake small caps! But yeah, I've been having a hard time aligning those
    things. I will play around with the word spacing as you suggested.  And I'll see
    what works with the 4x5. Thank you! And.. small small world!"
