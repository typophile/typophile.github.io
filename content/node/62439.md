  body: "I have a couple takes on this...\r\n\r\nMy first thought is that while the
    statement on Wikipedia may be true, it may have come about due to the lack of
    a dot-less \"i\" on early typesetting machines, thus forcing one or more tone
    accents to be added to a standard \"i.\"\r\n\r\nMy second thought is that Romanization
    and transliteration systems are designed to preserve the intent of the language
    in written form, and to make doing so easier, not harder. When using modern fonts,
    using a dotted \"i\" with accents falls into the realm of making things harder,
    not easier. (Romanization is the term I use when the system is the primary method
    for representing the language in written form, and transliteration is the term
    I use when it is a method represent the native script of a language using a different
    script, such as using the Latin script to represent Japanese.)\r\n\r\nRelated
    to my second thought, consider Pinyin. It is the standard method of transliterating
    Chinese (in China), is sometimes seen with special forms of the \"a\" and \"g\"
    characters, along with a seemingly special form of the acute accent to represent
    the rising tone in which the bottom-left tip is heavier than the upper-right one.
    For the \"a\" and \"g\" forms, this convention follows the forms typically see
    in italic faces, although the face is upright. In any case, both of these convention-like
    characteristics clearly conspire to make Pinyin harder to use, thus violating
    one of the important attributes of a transliteration system.\r\n\r\nI guess what
    I am trying to say, in a somewhat round-about way, is that the statement on Wikipedia
    may be true and false, for the reasons I stated above. I have the TCVN 5712:1993
    in my office, which may shed some light on this issue, but I suspect that it uses
    the dot-less \"i\" form.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV

  body: "Thanks, Ken, for your full and well-formulated reasoning. \r\n\r\nI agree
    that using a dotted form would be harder. Though I am attempting to incorporate
    Vietnamese support in my font, its orthography is somewhat unfamiliar to me. Since
    I've been unable to find examples of a dotted i with diacritics, and since my
    feeling is that Vietnamese is already ungainly enough with its compound diacritics,
    I am planning to omit the tittle for the time being."

  body: I don't think I have ever seen Vietnamese text with the dot preserved when
    a tone mark is added. As Ken notes, there may at one stage have been technical
    limitations that did not support dotless i, leading to the belief among some users
    that the dot should be preserved. A parallel case to that would be the French
    typewriter that lacked uppercase accent, leading many people to the conclusion
    that accents are properly omitted on uppercase letters, despite the continuous
    evidence of 500 years of French typography and publishing. In these situations,
    I recommend looking for examples of older, handset typography, books from reputable
    publishers, and also good quality vernacular handlettering in signs etc. In the
    case of Vietnamese, you might also investigate what Alexandre de Rhodes SJ did
    with <em>i</em> when he invented the system.

    which is the Vietnamese standard for the legacy (non-Unicode) encoding for Quoc
    ngu (the name of the Latin-based Vietnamese script). The code charts for VN1,
    VN2, and VN3 encoding clearly show the use of a dot-less \"i\" for the characters
    that have accents above. But, and quite interestingly, the accompanying text uses
    a font that includes the dot. It is quite inconsistent. The body text consistently
    uses the dotted \"i\" form, but the headings are inconsistent. For example, the
    title for Section 6 includes the word \"ki\" with an acute accent, and the \"i\"
    is dotted. Then, at the top of page 7, the title for the VN1 code chart includes
    the same word, and in a similar font, but using the dot-less \"i\" form.\r\n\r\nAnyone

  body: "Frank, there is sometimes a discrepancy between a language-specific diacritic
    form and a generic accent handling model. Much of the time, one knows the target
    language(s) for a font, but as one moves into larger fonts for widespread use
    one needs to start thinking about generic mechanisms for languages that one might
    not be aware of. Sometimes this means deliberately disabling language-specific
    diacritic forms as default representations, as in the SIL fonts, and relegating
    those forms to specific OT language systems. [Another approach would be an idea
    that Adam Twardoch put forward on the OT developer discussion list some time ago:
    register a generic language system tag, so that 'dflt' behaviour could still represent
    the majority or most common usage. So, for instance, the Vietnamese forms could
    be the default rendering, but a more generic mark placement would be accessible
    via this language system tag.]\r\n\r\nAnother instance of this problem is the
    Czech and Slovak 'caron' diacritics that take an apostrophe-like form. These are
    the normal default forms for the precomposed Unicode diacritic characters, but
    what happens when a user wants a more generic representation, i.e. an actual hacek
    sign above a <em>d l</em> or <em>t.</em> Given SIL's global and minority language
    mandate, it makes sense that they favour generic accent positioning as a default
    rendering."

    media (in fact, i've seen it 2-3 times in some very very old typeface).\r\n\r\nOn
    Vietnamese diacritic design, i think that the type designer should understand
    how vietnamese words is constructed: \r\nfisrt at all, there are 29 \"basic\"
    characters in alphabets list: \r\n\r\na\t\u0103\t\xE2\tb\tc\td\t\u0111\te\t\xEA\tg\th\ti\tk\tl\tm\tn\to\t\xF4\t\u01A1\tp\tq\tr\ts\tt\tu\t\u01B0\tv\tx\ty\r\n\r\nand
    may be 9+1 \"composite characters\":\r\n \r\nCH GH GI KH NG NGH NH PH TH TR\r\n\r\n(in
    some old dictionary, it's considered as a independent character in alphabets)\r\n\r\nThe
    Vietnamese words is build by composing Consonant (1 or more chars) + Vowel (single
    or composite vowel) <strong>and a tone mark (accent)</strong>. (this is the logic
    we learn to read, write Vietnamese!)\r\n\r\nBy this logic, there are some notes:\r\n\r\n-
    There is only one accent. Someone considers Vietnamese as double accent language,
    but it's view of non-vietnamese speaking people.\r\n\r\n- The accent is for entire
    word, not for an individual character. This one is importance for legibility:
    the accent should be easy to be distinguished from another char because it'll
    be recognized individually: \u1EC1 is not in alphabets list, normally 2 components
    of it will be read separately in 2 difference phrases. \r\n\r\nWith this is reason,
    in my view, all of vietnamese-enable Adobe typeface (Minion Pro, Myriad Pro, Arno
    Pro, Garamond Premier Pro) is bad for Vietnamese (ex: Minion Pro in the image
    of blokland's post)\r\n"

    the tone, and the letter /ohornhook/ is also two components, not three.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    keeping the accents separate from the base letters, breves, circumflexes and horns
