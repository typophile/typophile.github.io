    which has U.S. offices in San Francisco, Boston and New York.\r\n\r\n\"We wanted
    to reflect the right amount of change in eBay\u2019s new logo,\" Su Mathews, a
    senior partner at Lippincott, said in a statement provided by eBay. \"The design
    is inspired by today\u2019s vibrant marketplace and sleeker experiences. We leveraged
    the iconic color arrangement and approachable form to reflect eBay\u2019s heritage
    and evolved it with a brighter blue and darker yellow and a streamlined arrangement
    to create more visual harmony.\u201D\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/blog/2012/09/ebay-unveils-new-sleeker-logo.html"

    with all the filling words used, nobody notices that there is no business left

    logo, so it became more of a clean-up project.\r\n\r\n> No capital B anymore in

  body: "<cite>(Reuters) - EBay Inc executive Devin Wenig unveiled a new logo on Thursday,

    and collectibles toward full-priced, buy-it-now merchandise. </cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>EBay
    is focusing more on new, fixed-priced sales as it tries to compete better with
    Amazon.com Inc, which has been growing faster. Wenig said the new logo reflects
    this new direction.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>\"It's eBay today: a global online marketplace
    that offers a cleaner, more contemporary and consistent experience,\" he wrote.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Auction-style
    listings, used goods, vintage items and quirky, one-of-a-kind finds are still
    a big part of what makes buying and selling on eBay special,\" Wenig added. \"But
    we've evolved a lot in the past few years, and eBay is much more than auction-style
    listings today.\"</cite>"

    blue on your monitor, and perhaps a bit of anti-aliasing. The <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/announcements/new/index.html">ridiculous
    launch page</a> gives you an extreme sideways closeup of exactly how much contact
    there is.

  body: "Yes, I see from the close-up that it is supposed to kiss.\r\nHowever, the
    effect is ill-considered.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the /e to /b kiss is not two
    curved vector paths meeting tangentially at an in\uFB01nitely small asymptote,
    as the other two kisses are, but a border where the paths are coincident.\r\n\r\nThe
    Univers /e has a straight line edge at the corner of the bowl (see 1, below),
    which creates a length of simultaneous contrast that is optically jazzy, with
    perhaps some sub-pixel interference.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, in print, dead-hit
    registration is damn tricky.\r\n\r\nIt would be a good idea to modify the vectors
    of the /e so that they come to a single extrema point (2 or 3, below).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/curves_5983.png]"
