  now waiting and waiting for the Windows version, but alas, it has still not been
  released. In my despair I even asked Linotype last October via email and they said
  they hoped to have it out at the beginning of 2006.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering if anyone
  here can give me a more definive answer or recommend a compelling alternative for
  Windows."

  body: "Peter, I've been waiting and nagging about this for months as well, but a
    previous post pointed me in the direction of Proxima's <a href=\"http://www.proximasoftware.com/fontexpert/index.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">FontExpert2006</a>, which was just released a few days ago,
    and while I've only just downloaded the trial a few minutes ago, I like the interface
    a lot: full character set preview, easy creation of font sets, temporary activation
    (something Extensis Suitcase removed in their last version), etc. I'm just about
    to give their auto-activation for InDesign plug-in a test run and will report
    back here on the result, but even if the plug-in is buggy I have a feeling I'll
    be migrating to FontExpert (after 4 years running Suitcase).\r\n\r\nAs for Linotype,
    well, I'm sure they're busy with mergers and whatnot, but I'm tired of waiting.
    I don't mean to look a gift horse in the mouth (Linotype's FX being free and all),
    but, seriously, why not just throw a note on the website saying \"Don't hold your
    breath.\""

      fall as we have announced in TypeCon last week. Development is still in progress
      and the first release will be comparable to the 1.0 version of the Mac one.
      The reason for the delay is as any programmer, or type designer for that matter,
      will tell you: things just take soooo much time... \r\n\r\nI hope this helps
      :)"

    It's fast and clean. See www.high-logic.com/maintype.html.

    no problems with functionality. In any case, the updates will make sure that you
    stay on top of bug fixes.

    completely to start off.  Something I haven't experienced since I installed XP.
    \ And I don't find the program to offer much at all.  I own Suitcase and Typograf
    and have tried many other programs.  Typograf is well worth the $35.  It's incredible
    rich with features.  Suitcase and Font Expert are both better than this program
    and worth the money.  \r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "Sharon, I applaud you for even giving FX a shot; I've been so fed up with
    the wait on this that reading the long list of known issues with this beta was
    the icing on the cake. While they were probably trying to address the frustration
    Windows users have felt, waiting and waiting and waiting, this release just screams
    \"we can't be bothered to make this thing actually <em>work</em>, so here's a
    bungled version for the time being.\"\r\n\r\nLinotype didn't have to develop FX
    at all, and for their part I realize all they're getting out of it is PR and some
    traffic to their store, but to my mind the PR attempt has backfired in a big way.
    A couple of years ago I simply thought of Linotype as a big foundry where one
    can purchase font licenses, and now, simply because this ball has been dropped
    so badly, they've lost me as a possible consumer of their product.\r\n\r\nI'm
    one person, of course, so who cares what I think, I'm just pissing in the wind
    here, but if I feel this way I have a feeling others might as well."

    than beta, as far as I'm concerned. Beta should mean most of the bugs are worked
    out.

  body: "High-Logic's MainType is really nice. I have trialled all the other Windows
    options and MainType is by far the best. It's fast and easy to use, but very powerful.\r\nThe
    main thing I like about it is that it doesn't try to 'organise' your fonts for
    you. If your fonts are already organised how you like, it will work with this.\r\nYou
    can browse your active fonts or fonts in folders elsewhere on your computer. You
    get to see a sample preview which you can easily type over or revert to a number
    of presets, plus a full character map. You also get a choice between activating
    and permanently installing fonts.\r\nHope this helps.\r\nbtw I don't work for
    them, just seems that people have a lot of trouble finding decent, stable font
    managers for Windows!"
