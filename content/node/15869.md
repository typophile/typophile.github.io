  body: "No, it's not a riddle.  I was just wondering what everyone's preferences
    are.\r\n\r\nI see that some designs retain a few upright math symbols such as
    the addition, equal, and greater/lesser than, but then the numerals are skewed.
    \ I skew those symbols.\r\n\r\nI keep the copyright and registered symbols upright,
    but then I skew my trademark glyph.  Any graphical elements such as bullets or
    bonus ornaments stay the same as well.  I'm on the fence when it comes to paragraph/linebreak
    marks."

  body: "Some years ago I had this idea that numerals shouldn't be slanted. And not
    really because the math symbols often aren't, more because of \"ideological\"
    reasons... I ran this by Evert B in Leipzig, and he said he thought there was
    some merit to the idea. When I finish Harrier for real (as a stand-alone design)
    I might do that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Circular forms are optional, but most of the time they are not skewed, (particularly
    in sans).\r\nSince Asterisk, daggers and ppg are not normally happy in italic,
    or it don't matter, Reference symbols are optional. Math is a no-no as far as
    I'm concerned. Everything else gets skewed."

  body: There's a difference in fit between an oblique sans and a serifed italic.
    The italic lower-case serifs cause most of these glyphs to occupy a more vertical
    space -- thereby making a "roman" parenthesis a better fit (except before f, j,
    p and after d, f, l). So really, vertical (roman) parentheses in serifed italics
    is a good idea, although kerning them with the problem characters mentioned is
    required, and throughout the font also.

  body: I think this business of slanting or not slanting math characters and such
    goes back to the fact that many of these were not part of normal fonts in metal
    type. They were extra sorts which were purchased separately and could be used
    with any font. Linotype, for instance, had  only one or two versions of each,
    none of them slanted. The idea that these should all follow the design of a particular
    font is a fairly recent idea.

  body: "The math issue seems to me to revolve around usage.  I am not a math person
    so I can't answer but I wonder what situations might occur when setting math where
    italic is helpful? Maybe there is no real use for it.  Maybe just when setting
    primes in italic to distinguish them from the original referant?\r\n\r\nChrisL"
