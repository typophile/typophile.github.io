  accidentally. So here it is again - this time with pdf preview. Did some modifications
  in the meantime - so some of the characters may look a little different in this
  version\u2026 Thanks to all of you for the comments.\r\n\r\n(Strangular is my first
  try to make a typeface. I got it as a project - client wanted a clean, simple font
  with good readability as the main preference. Will be used in some gaming consoles,
  i\u2019m not exactly sure about details..)\r\n\r\n\u2014-\r\nwww.lifeforms.sk"

  body: "You need more space after the \u201Cscing\u201D line and you don\u2019t want
    to justify like that the first two lines, do you ?\r\nThe black stroke an the
    top it looks disturbing.\r\nI find the \u2018M\u2019 to be too narrow and the
    \u2018W\u2019 too wide.\r\nI like your attempt."

    on the upper case L could do with being shortened, or maybe just available shorter
    as an alternate figure"

  body: "As I already mentioned in your deleted post;\r\n\r\nI like this, the geometric
    feel it has, without it becoming too impersonal.\r\nSome crits:\r\nThe lc 'a'
    might benefit from a little bit smaller bowl. It's not needed per s\xE9, but I
    think the contrast would be better, when you compare it to the size of the counter
    of the 'e'. Something like that would maybe be better. \r\nThe uc 'L' arm should
    be shortened a bit. The left shoulder of your 'm' has some bumps in the curve.
    The 'r' is a bit wide (maybe chop some of the arm).\r\nThe crosscurl in the 'Q'
    somehow doesn't look natural at the moment.\r\nBoth 's' and 'S' have some minor
    issues, although I cannot pinpoint exactly what it is at the moment.\r\nI'm not
    sure it's a problem, but some of your (nice looking) inktraps could probably be
    made a tad bigger. Especially on characters where the shoulder joins the stem
    like on the 'n'. So the 'p', 'h', 'm', etc. To prevent the stems that extend above
    the shoulder clogging up."

  body: "Thanks to all of you for the advices and comments. \r\n\r\n<strong>Quincunx</strong>
    > especially to you for taking the time and writing the helpful tips. I prepared
    a new version - did most of the modifications you mentioned (like enlarging the
    inktraps - but just a little bit ) and checked the curvatures of the letters,
    found and corrected some errors. However, i didn't like \"a\" with much smaller
    bowl - it somehow looked cheap to me... Also, i came up with new Q crosscurl and
    prepared more characters. Everything posted in the strangular_v2.pdf\r\n\r\n<strong>Alessandro</strong>

  body: "Nice one. I like that Q better. Curves are now smooth. I'm not sure if the
    larger inktraps made anything better, but they do look nice now. Maybe someone
    else has advice on that.\r\nIf you didn't like an 'a' with a smaller bowl, then
    of course don't do it. :)\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that ther were no more people
    with tips. Because I'm no real expert like some of the other people on this forum.
    But maybe someone will post some other time."
