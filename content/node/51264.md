  typeface are very much restricting (such as f.alt + l lig which looks like an A).
  However, I quite liked the look of some glyphs, even though I couldn't find a solution
  for some (k, for instance). If this works out, I plan to include as many alternates
  as I could think of, as well as swashes, discretionary ligs, different weights,
  etc. I just need to make the base design solid.\r\n\r\nAny comments, suggestions,
  guys? Feedback is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks. :)"

  body: "Descender's tail of lowercase q + h = k\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion. Interesting,
    it reminds me of something, but I can't quite put my finger on what. Keep going,
    it's looking pretty good. "

  body: 'I''ve worked out some glyphs: completed the default lc, added pilcrows, added
    an experimental ampersand that looks too tall, and some alternates. It somehow
    looks like old school to me. (Untitled-2.pdf)'

  body: "Uploaded the new PDF file (Untitled-4.pdf) containing all the current glyphs.
    Right now, it's looking okay, but I fear that I might lose my focus when designing
    the rest of the uppercase. Take the F/F.alt and H/H.alt for example. I wasn't
    sure if the H.alt was good enough as the default one, so I made a clean H and
    then just made an alternate version. In my opinion, that's good, as the user can
    choose the glyph he/she desires. I'm just an amateur though, so I want to hear
    some feedback on this. :)\r\n\r\nAny comment, suggestion, or criticism is most
    appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Can you do an alt. version of the G with the leg of the k kicking off the
    front? \r\n\r\nAlso, push the straight leg of the R out further, it's very top
    heavy and needs better support... more along the lines of the R from Neutraface.\r\n\r\nThe
    S and s are quite different from each other... you might want to pick one style.
    \r\n\r\nI think the lowercase f could have a descender, similar to Fedra Sans.
    \r\n\r\nStill loving this, can't wait to see more. "

  body: Thank you for your comments. The semester, unfortunately, has started, and
    thus I have a very reduced time for myself. I didn't abandon it, although I'm
    slow to work on it, as there are many extra subjects other than my major subjects
    in our university.

  body: "Well honestly, I'm surprised I was the only one giving you feedback. Anyway,
    I'll keep checking back for updates, should you find some time to work on this.
    I think you have a fun font started here and will be interested to see how it
    develops. \r\n\r\nGood luck with your studies.  "

  body: Nice type and I agree with you when you said you thought the typeface looked
    old school. It reminds me of the Art Nouveau period but modernized. I also love
    how the tails are sharp edged instead of the typical curve. Good work.

  body: Looks great! The only critique that I have is that some glyphs are not consistent
    with others. Some glyphs are completely sharp edged, while others are sharp edged
    and curved. I prefer the sharp edged and curved style. I think that if those glyphs
    are reworked to similarities of the rest, you would have a great typeface on your
    hands. Good job.
