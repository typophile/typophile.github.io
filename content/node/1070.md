  <BR>Sometimes what goes down does not come back up. <BR> <BR>Details... <BR> <BR>August
  20, 2003 <BR> <BR>Due to recent email self-replicating virus floods all over the
  world, the lab has decided to reconsider its email exposure policy. As this happened
  in the middle of a major web site update, I am using this circumstance to take apostrophiclab.com
  offline for a while, until the new site is ready. The site will hopefully be back
  around the middle of September. A new format will be introduced, including the following:
  <BR> <BR>- Periodical alphabet drawing courses, in both Fontlab and Illustrator.
  <BR>- Periodical type history and font critique articles. <BR>- Focus on text fonts.
  <BR>- Possible affiliations with open source entities. <BR>- An email newsletter,
  and possibly a print periodical. <BR>- A font troubleshooting / typography consultation
  section. <BR> <BR>All the Apostrophe/Fredrick Nader fonts that existed at the old
  lab site will change their licensing status from freeware to public domain. From
  that point on, all fonts designed and published on this site will be public domain.
  Naturally this will mean that many of the fonts that were on the old lab site will
  not be here anymore, but I believe that over the past three years there has been
  enough dissemination of this lab&#39;s work that everything can still be found somewhere
  on the internet.  <BR> <BR>All the best, <BR> <BR>Fredrick Nader <BR> <BR>'

    to be sad that one of the world&#39;s most famous and not-exactly-repentant font
    pirates has been having a rough time of it? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    several other people.

    on the recent email virus. Am I missing something?
