  Q.\r\n\r\nIt's entirely possible this is a custom font or an altered standard font,
  but I figured if anyone would know it would be the folks here.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate
  any guidance you can provide.\r\n\r\nThe text is \"AQUA D\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card_6670.jpg]"

  body: I'm afraid I've never crossed such a /Q. Looks definitely custom to me. /A
    could come from Helvetica Black, /U Bauhaus (actually the entire treatment is
    "Bauhaus") and from Serif Gothic ITC.

    body: "Thanks for the feedback. I've never seen such a Q either, and even the
      rest of the font looks ... off. I knew the guy who created this logo and honestly-
      he isn't really a creative type so I have no idea where a custom font would
      have come from. I'll look into it some more and see if I can find out where
      it might have come from.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else- I have some larger, higher
      resolution versions of this font and I can just turn it into an SVG and work
      with that if necessary."

    Searching the word might dig up a candidate.\r\nDon "

    body: I agree it looks like a stenciled font- and I did a search for stenciled
      fonts- still no luck. I'm going to keep searching- but at this point I think
      it's a stock font that has had many of the letters customized.
