<p>Actually, if you look at some of the hot-metal fonts, they were offered with optional long descenders. Traditionally, &ldquo;short&rdquo; descenders were used by newspapers, so they could pack in more copy. Linotype wasn&rsquo;t dumb, since more machines were bought by newspaper publishers than book printers, the short descenders became standard, and &ldquo;long&rdquo; descenders became an extra-cost option.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t resist, what are usually termed &ldquo;modern&rdquo; figures came about to support advertising, which used a lot of full caps. &ldquo;Old style&rdquo; numbers are better termed &ldquo;lower case&rdquo; figures, as that would indicate their use rather than date of origin. There is always a problem with date-of-origin: &ldquo;modern&rdquo; figures, for example, are just as up-to-date as corsets. Not really a &ldquo;build&rdquo; issue, though . . .</p>

<p>I am coming to the conclusion that this is a matter of optical scaling, with small sizes calling for shorter extenders, normal for a bit longer, and headings still longer. I think Garamond Premier does this, though I don&rsquo;t have it so I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m more than a bit intrigued by the kerning suggestion above.

<p>I assume it helped that <cite>this is in fact a long-established truth.</cite></p>
<p>Specifically concerning the shortening of descenders more than the ascenders, it makes sense (up to a point of course) for a good reason: relative frequencies. When you give as much room to the descenders as the ascenders(see for example Ruse) you&rsquo;re in effect wasting apparent size. In fact one indication of a good text font is the &ldquo;g&rdquo;: if it doesn&rsquo;t look slightly cramped vertically, there&rsquo;s something wrong. That said, aesthetics can of course be allowed to alter the course of efficiency, when it makes sense.</p>

A &ldquo;close quote&rdquo; or an &ldquo;apostrophe&rdquo; is, historically, a raised comma. An &ldquo;open quote&rdquo; a turned comma. If you&rsquo;re going to redesign them, feel free. If I have to use the font, I&rsquo;ll just turn them over &amp; kern them.</p>
<p>As to the long descenders, you&rsquo;re right about the &ldquo;g&rdquo; &ndash; it &amp; to some extent the &ldquo;y&rdquo; basically determine how long the descenders can be. I&rsquo;m rather less convinced about the wasting of apparent size; you can&rsquo;t be a book designer these days with out specifying type 10/15 or so.</p>
<p>Bill:</p>
<p>No, not a matter of optical scaling. Frequently footnotes look better with shorter descenders, but ultimately I think it depends on the leading. There are book designers today who use the text leading with footnotes. In fact, I just finished setting a small book where the footnotes were specified 8/14. Conversely, display type usually looks better (to my eye) with short descenders. But as always, much depends on the design of the letters, and the design of the book.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about the type itself, not a possible usage preference. A bad font, or something bad about a font, can sometimes be used to good effect (like when people use Bell Centennial large). Also, to clarify my position: sometimes waste is exactly what&rsquo;s needed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You are of course right that shorter extenders are not a requirement. But the practical constraint here is that if you have longer descenders at small size then you are more or less required to do more leading, and so the publisher has to pay more for paper.</p>
<p>It seems like whenever economy is a prime consideration (eg newspapers), then publications both historically and now generally go for relatively small type sizes with large x-heights. That way you still get decent readability with economy.</p>
<p>So as a designer, if you are going to do optical sizes&ndash;which I think are a good idea for readability&ndash;you have the question of what demands to serve.</p>
<p>I really wonder how much demand there is for 8 point type with a small x-height with 14 point leading. I must admit it sounds weird to me. I would think that it is going to be more readable with a larger x-height than is ideal for an 11 or 12 point font. And then if you want to make the 8 point type still more readable you can give it some more space between the lines.</p>
<p>Now you could design with three different extenders, like Trinite, and combine that with optical sizes, like Minion. But the question becomes whether you are making a huge amount of pointless work for yourself.</p>
<p>I guess what I am saying is that I can see that larger x-height at 8 point is an advantage for many uses, and I am having a hard time figuring out when a small x-height at 8 point would be an advantage.</p>
<p>You tell me: Is there a demand for such a creature?</p>
<p>On display sizes: I already acknowledged that all bets are off there. It is mainly an aesthetic choice, and would depend on the design. For example the much-maligned ITC Garamond, with its large x-height, actually works at display sizes.</p>

I agree with you about a lot of things (ITC Garamond &amp; Mrs. Eaves, for example). Maybe we&rsquo;re having a terminological debate rather than one of substance, but I doubt it. I once heard a designer (book interior, not type) say something to the effect that it was the designer&rsquo;s job to challange the reader. To which I replied, &ldquo;NO. It is the author&rsquo;s perogative to challenge the reader. If you want to challenge the reader, write a book.&rdquo; The parallel is, unless you&rsquo;re an advovate of grunge typography, of course looks matter. And an aesthetic is perforce cultural; a part of that means it is developed over time, that history counts. If a designer (of any sort) wants to be experiemental, feel free, but don&rsquo;t think experiementation leads surely to acceptance. It fails far more often than it succeeds.</p>
<p>Bill,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a dinosaur, I still think in terms of the page, not an element like leading. But fashion changes, and paper has dropped in price relative to total (book) printing costs. And since (1) chapters usually begin a new page, and (2) book printing is purchased in terms of signatures, there really isn&rsquo;t too much cost increase for a lot of leading, unless the book has over 1,000,000 characters. What usually suffers is the foot margin, due to a publisher&rsquo;s requirement for, say, 2,800 characters per page, and a designer&rsquo;s insistance on 14-15 points lead.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to take a serious look at long descenders, they have only to look at, say, Monotype metal Bembo versus Monotype PostScript Bembo. Same with Monotype metal Baskerville versus Monotype PostScript Baskerville. And you&rsquo;re right, it is ascenders too. I allow that type for book texts isn&rsquo;t a hot item, but one of the plusses of OpenType is that it doesn&rsquo;t take that much more effort to address two markets; print where packing in the characters is important, and print where the look of the page (really, the spread) is still considered important.</p>
<p>Actually, the book I mentioned with 8/14 leading was a poor exaple, in that the leading works for this book. The book was a rememberance of Richard Eckersley, and the only piece with notes was by Richard&rsquo;s son, Sam. There were only a few notes, and they were as important as the text. Would that more designers paid attention to just what is in the notes.</p>
<p>And please kern the quotes. Changing the class kerning where &ldquo;quoteleft&rdquo; has another member in it&rsquo;s class, namely &ldquo;quotedblleft&rdquo; is beyond me, since I don&rsquo;t want to have a positive kern between two single quotes, &amp; can&rsquo;t figure out how to add the exception. I&rsquo;m a comp, not a computer programmer.</p>

<p>I still think in terms of the page</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt you&rsquo;re right as a designer and compositor to think in terms of the page&ndash;or page spread.</p>
<p>What I am thinking about in terms of x-height and descenders is readability and aesthetics, first and foremost. I need you and your colleagues to tell me what your needs are.</p>
<p>Recently in one of the (interminable) threads on readablity, Kevin Larson quoted some research saying that 11 point type (I assume a relatively normal x-height, seriffed book face) is the most readable, and that bigger and smaller type people read more slowly. David Berlow cited research that newspaper readers prefer between 8 and 11 point.</p>
<p>Books and newspapers have different demands, and I don&rsquo;t have the knowledge to give numbers on what works best. I just observe two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Aesthetically, as well as for readability, a variation in the same design seems to work better with a bigger x-height at smaller sizes. Personally, I think a lot of type today goes too far in chopping the extenders, but some reduction is traditional. I know it is for Caslon, and I believe also for Garamond, and probably many others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing descenders only, as was the rule in the early 20th century, is aesthetically a problem. The ascenders and descenders should have some balance. It seems like it works best with the descenders somewhat shorter, but not massively. For example, what the short descenders forced on Goudy were pretty bad&ndash;at least in some versions I have seen&ndash;and P22&rsquo;s full extender version is a definite improvement, I think. However, MF Benton designed Goudy Catalogue, also with short descenders. But it is intended for small sizes, and much heavier, and I think Benton pulled off the design of the short descenders pretty well, for the purpose of the type.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll kern the &ldquo;'___'&rdquo; Message received, thanks.</p>

<p><em>unless you’re an advocate of grunge typography, of course looks matter</em></p>
<p>Even then, they matter. The goals are different, the tastes intentionally contrary, but looks always matter. I wouldn&rsquo;t compare grunge type to experimental type anymore than I would compare Experimental Electronic to Madonna&rsquo;s last electronic-influenced album.</p>

<p>it can, using the &ldquo;locl&rdquo; feature. But the default glyph shapes should be the ones usable universally, i.e. across all languages, in case that an application does not support &ldquo;locl&rdquo; (none of the currently shipping popular applications does, yet).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For Mrs. Eaves, it was someone else who pointed out how the serifs are so long and thick, and the contrast so low, they look geared to tiny sizes, but the x-height is tiny with long extenders, implying display, or at least larger-size use. It can&rsquo;t decide what size it&rsquo;s for. With ITC Garamond, the conventions that led to it developed in advertising; hand-lettered headlines tended to be based on the text type used in small sizes, but adapted for display, with tighter fit, more delicate serifs, more contrast. As the decades ticked by and standards dropped, all that was left of those conventions was the urge to space everything tightly and fuss over serif shapes, so ITC Garamond was essentially a display variant of Garamond 3, except that other inescapable trend in the 70s was to make x-heights gargantuan, so the result was a typeface with detailing appropriate for about 120 points and up, with x-height and other proportions suitable for about 5 point. And now we get to look at miles of it in 9 point on glossy paper in grey ink. Puke.</p>
<p>The original topic: Kern uncommon pairs, is a perpetual issue in designing type. Thanks for providing some real uses. That topic alone would be worth sticking to&hellip;. ;)   Anyone have others they always look for?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Carl, interesting analysis. I agree with you about using Mrs. Eaves or ITC Garamond at small sizes&ndash;that they don&rsquo;t work for the reasons you say.</p>
<p>But at display sizes they do have a certain eye appeal. I think at display sizes there is no rule about extender lengths, and both typefaces both pull off their designs with a certain eye-appeal.</p>
<p>My problem is that both have a stylishness and glamour that turns to distaste after a while. They are like exaggerated styles in fashion that look great for two months and then you look back and think: why did we ever think that looked good?</p>
<p>Maybe, though, both the appeal and the distaste is because of the incongruousness of detailing vs proportion that you point out. &ndash;So they work on one level, but the lack of balance makes them wear out their welcome.</p>
