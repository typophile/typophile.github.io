  body: Looks like it was created by hand. The m&#39;s and the a&#39;s don&#39;t quite
    match.

  body: Though it does look created by hand, it&#39;s actually an &#34;N&#34; followed
    by an &#34;M&#34;, making the word &#34;Granma&#34;... and the &#34;A&#34;s looks
    pretty similar to me...
