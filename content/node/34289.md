  airport in Chicago: a trashy little deli/bar in one of the terminals named \"CHICAGO
  salutes THE GRAPHIC ARTS\". The form of the salute? A cheesy mural on one wall.
  Maybe they should rename it \"CHICAGO salutes NON-STANDARD CAPITALIZATION\" or \"CHICAGO
  salutes SIGNS SET IN HELVETICA\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chicago_6452.jpg]"
