body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/badonkadonk_4724.gif]\r\n\r\nWhile developing
  a website for a small-town community retail food store, my client (who is the in-house
  print designer there) mentioned that he is thinking of using the free font Badonk-a-donk
  as part of the store's brand identity.\r\n\r\nAside from all the questions of whether
  this cartoon style is appropriate or not, what suggestions does anyone have for
  retail fonts that would look better than this, but still convey an informal, fun,
  hand-rendered, or perhaps even cartoon-centric feeling?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  any suggestions.\r\n\r\nSorry for the small sample. You can see a character set
  of Badonk-a-donk <a href=\"http://www.fontriver.com/font/badonk-a-donk/\">here</a>."
