  other) apartment buildings from the 1890s and 1900s. I got used to seeing some really
  well-formed letters like these down in DC, but in New York I\u2019m finding more
  variety. Does anybody know where these letters came from?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/viclettrs_4681.jpg]"

  body: "I assume they were drafted by the architect in his elevation, and executed
    by stone masons along with the rest of the details.\r\nArchitects were familiar
    with drafting letters for the descriptive text in their plans, and fitted the
    style of lettering to the style of the building, so were practised and knowledgeable
    letterers. If lettering was required to appear on the buildings, they were up
    to the task. Although the L and M here are a tad wide, and the R too narrow.\r\n\r\nThe
    use of a period is interesting.\r\nThe Wall Street Journal still uses a period
    in its nameplate."

  body: "Thanks, Nick, it didn\u2019t occur to me that the letters would have been
    drawn by the architect. This would make a lot of sense\u2014I\u2019ve noticed
    that similar buildings from one neighborhood and one time period have matching
    letters. I assumed that the letters were cast or metal, but it probably is because
    the architect was drawing them all. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll still talk about it with
    James Mosely and Paul Shaw, tho."
