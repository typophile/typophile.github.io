  body: "Thanks Frode. I never heard of that version of LK futura. Do you know if
    he made it for Larissa Kasper? \r\nI have been trying to find out the origin of
    this type and if it's available to license. So far I have only see it used in
    Wax magazine. http://readwax.com/"

    what I could gather, it is a modification, made <em>by</em> Larissa Kasper, of
    some cut of Futura, probably specifically for Wax.\r\nSince this is in itself
    a grey area regarding licensing, I strongly doubt the font is available for relicensing."
