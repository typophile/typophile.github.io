body: This is a question that has plagued me ever since my earliest days in web design.
  Until now, I had not a forum where I could pose it. <BR> <BR><b>Background</b> <BR>Most
  of us are more than familiar with the concept of font/typeface pairing in graphic/communication
  design to provide contrast and visual interest. Weather that constitutes two faces
  from different type classifications &#40;e.g., a serif and a sans-serif or a gothic
  and a handwritten, etc.&#41; or two or more font variations from one typeface family
  &#40;e.g., a condensed and a regular width or a heavy and a thin, etc.&#41; is up
  to the designer. <BR> <BR>Generally speaking, we&#39;ve been taught, advised or
  simply learned through experience that two fonts/faces provide the best results.
  Not to say that one cannot use more than two or just one, but one too often we see
  the schizophrenic or mundane examples of both extremes. Which brings me to my question

  body: My feeling with the limitations of the web is to create a CI based on colors
    and/or graphics. Let the logo stand alone and don&#39;t force the content on the
    web into your CI. Most people go to a site for content not CI reinforcement, so
    if it feels like the printed collateral and provides the information the person
    is looking for I feel that is as much as you can expect. Dan

    to your #1 above &#40;where all HTML-text sites are really the only instances

  body: Joseph, I&#39;d advise keeping the flash graphics to a minium. Everyone that
    I know, if they have the option to bypass the flash screen they do. Flash sites
    are annoying in general. This is just my opinion, Dan

  body: I would have to concur with Daniel here. I&#39;m a <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web
    standards</a> advocate. Flash will never replace web standards. No matter what
    Macromedia does, Flash will never be as accessible, SE friendly, or scalable as
    some combination of W3 standards based technologies. <BR> <BR>The fact remains
    that it is a plug-in, it&#39;s binary, and it&#39;s cpu intensive. For a targetted
    demographic, motion graphics, and rich media applications it&#39;s feasable, but
    for regular web publishing -- there&#39;s no comparison. I would go as far as
    to say that when wider SVG support is  a reality, that Macromedia will have the
    forsight to leverage it in spite of SWF. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m
    not Flash bashing. You can do some amazing things with it and I&#39;ve always
    enjoyed working with Flash. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s often used inappropriately
    and considered by many to be some sort of magic bullet. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s all
    this have to do with typography anyway?  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Tim, have you ever seen the book &#34;Fresh Styles for web designers&#34;
    by curt cloninger from New Riders. It gives good examples of different styles
    of web sites. Dan

  body: Dan -- I&#39;ve heared of it but never actually looked inside. I&#39;ll check
    it out next time I&#39;m at the book store. I supposes it may it some ways address
    my original query. <BR> <BR> -t
