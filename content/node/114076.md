body: "Hi everybody, I am trying to find a font similar to JAF Bernini Sans which
  our team loves but we are doing a website that has a lot of similarities to Medium.com
  and since they use that font we want to have a different font so that we don't feel
  so much like we are copying them.  \r\n\r\nThis is to be used for the web so its
  important that it renders well on different screens. And one thing we love about
  JAF Bernini Sans is that it looks great on bold headlines (like on Medium.com) but
  also works great for small text (which is the font used on typographica.org for
  their small text). \r\n\r\nSo if anybody has any recommendations for similar fonts
  that will render well I will really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the
  link to JAF Bernini Sans so you see the font:\r\n\r\nhttp://justanotherfoundry.com/bernini-sans"
