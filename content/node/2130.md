body: I was just browsing through my copy of Fonts &amp; Logos, when my eyes lighted
  on reproductions of Pierre Moreau&#39;s  1644 script type &#40;p.178 and elsewhere&#41;.
  Has there been a digital revival of it? My google searches only turned up links
  to book auctions selling samples of his work. I was thinking it might make a dandy
  of an italic. Anyone know? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy

    to fill the space, or just drop the tail low. More complete showing p 129. '

  body: If you used some good kerning it might not be so bad, since there aren&#39;t
    any lc letters with a hole at the top-right. The only real problem would be &#34;Af&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Dropping the tail low would just make it boring. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    but now that Randy has pointed him out the guy&#39;s coming out of the woodwork!
    On Wednesday I found the thing in De Vinne, today I found this sample form Marius

    alt="Moreau2.gif"> <BR> <BR>The useful thing &#40;for somebody considering a revival
    of this script&#41; is that Audin mentions two works by Moreau using it: his &#34;L&#39;Imitation

  body: Pierre Simon Fournier had a similar hand script. Some  <BR>digital interpretations
    include <a href="http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/chanson/pk_chanson.htm" target="_blank">Chanson
    d&#39;Amor</a> and <a href="http://www.lineto.com/content.html?ID=161&amp;dir_id=66"
    target="_blank">Batarde Coulee</a>. <BR> <BR>And I should probably mention the
    quaint <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fournier-mt/" target="_blank">Fournier
    Italic</a> itself.  <BR>He must have been influenced by Moreau.
