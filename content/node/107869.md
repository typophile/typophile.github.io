body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Feynman Typography_6563.JPG]\r\nI'm trying
  to find the font used in the Feynman Lectures on Physics, a physics textbook written
  in the 1960's and published by Addison-Wesley.  Attached is an excerpt from it.
  \ Note that newer editions of the Feynman Lectures, like the New Millenium edition
  and the recently released free online edition, use completely different fonts.  But
  I'm trying to find the font of the original book.\r\nWhat technology was Addison-Wesley
  using back in the 1960's to publish books?  Linotype or something?  If the font
  they were using does not exist for computers, what is the computer font that most
  closely resembles it?\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThank You in
  Advance. "

    best guess is that the body copy is set in [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Times/fonts/|Times]].
    It seems slightly more condensed that most modern digital versions, but that could
    also be a function of the phototypesetting process (optically stretching or slanting
    type was one of the possibilities with phototypesetting technology).\r\n\r\nThe
    chapter title seems to be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/poster-bodoni/bodoni-poster-italic/|Bodoni
    Poster Italic]]. It is at slightly more of an oblique slant than modern digitals,
    but still recognizable, and again probably given the additional slant with a phototypesetter.\r\n\r\nThe
    word /in/ between /Atoms/ and /Motion/ is in a different type, looks like an oblique
    sans, but there is neither sufficient clarity nor diversity of letters here to
    guess at what that might be."

  body: "Andrew correctly identified the fonts, but the book was almost certainly
    set in hot metal. Most US textbooks were set on the Linotype in 1964, when Addison-Wesley
    published the first edition of the Feynman Lectures. Monotype, another automated
    hot-metal process, was more widely used in the UK, and was often used in the US
    for books with tabular matter and complex equations. Photocomposition was not
    in widespread use for books until the 1970s.\r\nThe title <em>Physics in Motion</em>
    was probably set by hand in foundry type, which might explain why the two different
    fonts don't have a common baseline."
