body: "Hi. I'm looking for a free font that is geometric  like  Optima or Futura,
  but with thick and thin lines, somewhat like the Rea Irvin font for New Yorker.
  \ Was reading the thread here about Vogue, several geometrics mentioned, but none
  with the thick/thin aspect.  My brother tells me he has one on his PC and he's certainly
  not one to purchase any fonts.  Any clues?  Most of my font experience is with Adobe.\r\n\r\nAccidently
  just posted to another thread this same query. Leaarnng."

    (not quite geometric) or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/peignot_std_complete_vp/?sample_text=THICK%20AND%20THIN">Peignot</a>?

    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_vintage_std_regular/">ITC
    Vintage</a> have an Irvin feel.

  body: Thanks Stephen, those are good suggestions. None matches the sample my brother
    sent, and for this particular project, it would be great to find it for free.
