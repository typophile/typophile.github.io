body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm setting my thesis in Times Linotype Standard 12.0 pt. For the
  footnotes I use Linotype Times Ten as it works well at the 10pt size my footnotes
  are set in.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some ideas for Heading and Titling, bearing in
  mind that it's a thesis not a piece of design work.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm using
  Helvetica Neue Linotype Medium 65 for some headings, contrasted with Helevetica
  Neue Linotype Light 45 for others. See Attachment.\r\n\r\nI think the Helvetica
  Neue goes will with the Times LT, I'm just worried about context. I think it might
  be too modern for a work on 17th century history.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a nice
  contrasting heading typeface with times. As you can see my fall back is Trade Gothic
  No 2 with Sabon Linotype. I willing to buy.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"
