body: "In an effort to see what the wiki's like, I added entries for [[Rudolf Koch]]
  and [[schaftstiefelgrotesk]] types, as well as filling out the entry for [[blackletter]].
  I have no doubt that others are going to want to rework what I did, as I mostly
  concentrated on the historical aspects of blackletter I find most interesting, but
  I thought I'd get the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough, there's not yet a category
  in the wiki for typefaces."

  body: "Awesome stuff, good to see others adding stuff. I added an [[Adrian Frutiger]]
    and [[Eric Gill]] wiki earlier, and I imagine people will want to rework mine
    as well.\r\n\r\nBut something is better than nothing.\r\n\r\nRe: Blackletter,
    I have recently wanted to learn more about these types so it was cool to read.
    I just picked up this book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568981252/qid=1115448806/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/701-2948080-2576335\">Blackletter:
    Type and National Identity</a> the other day, but have not had a chance to read
    it yet."
