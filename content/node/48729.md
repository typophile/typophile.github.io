  I'm working on a logo for the little graphic & web design business I have. \r\n\r\nThe
  name of the business comes from Norway, as it was originally ment to only have clients
  locally, but as I've started with my studies I'm going to apply to jobs and hopefully
  have clients internationally. \"Piraja\" means \"Piranha\".\r\n\r\nI'm satisified
  with the mark and the typography, but the reason I'm asking for feedback is because
  this whole process has taken me many months, and the mark and the typography came
  in my mind last night. So I want some objective feedback from someone who has never
  seen it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm most happy with the mark and the colors in 3 and 5,
  they are the same expect I've added a line of text with my name in 3. \r\n\r\nPlease
  help me out with this, any feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ps_3500.png]"

  body: "I don't like how the right hand side of the mark (2,3,4,6) is flat rather
    than circular. It seems like a mistake. Shouldn't it be round, or clearer that
    its the fish's head - like 1 and 4?\r\n\r\nI love the colours, and i'd seriously
    consider using different combinations of the three colours in your comms rather
    than settling on just one.\r\n\r\nI like the type too - i think it works well
    in combination with the mark. Don't put your name there too as in 3, whats the
    point? What does it add? Seems to make the Piraja Studio name redundant and adds
    complexity to a lovely and simple logo. "

  body: "David: You've seen right, the right hand side for the mark is flat, and although
    it might seem like a mistake \u2013 it's not. It's part of the fish bones, a new
    one that is sticking up and I thought it added a little personality to it, because
    it's not a perfect circle, and I've worked hours on the fish bone illustration
    as well, adding it alot of detail when you really zoom in. The feedback you are
    giving is great though, because I was also afraid that it would look like a mistake.
    Perhaps I should either make it more clear that it's a detail, or make the cirle
    perfectly round."

  body: "I'll echo the comments already made about the colors and typography. It has
    a nice simple feel to it. \r\n\r\nPerhaps you may want to zoom out a tad so that
    the shape of the fish is a bit more apparent. Not a whole lot, but just enough
    so that the mark won't be confused with a coffee bean, as I'm seeing in 2, 3,
    5 & 6. (especially 6 with the coloring)\r\n\r\nGood work so far, can't wait to
    see how it turns out.\r\n\r\npenn"

    the behaviour of the fish I'm so interested in and I really like the name a lot.\r\n\r\nGlen:
    I think what you are pointing out is supposed to be the head. I like your idea
    though, do you mean that the head should actually be a bite? So that the circle
    has lost a part with some bite marks left?\r\n\r\n"

  body: ".I see there is something coming out with a fish bones in the negative space.
    What about upgrading the red color part to look like some lips .. You know those
    images where the space draws a negative space form while negative space form draws
    the space form.\r\n\r\nexample: http://picasaweb.google.com/rjc.uk.web/OpticalIllusions/photo#5029226944519385362\r\n\r\njust
    a small note: If You go with this style of visuals, perception normally gets only
    1 of 2 shapes if no one explained the idea to the viewer.\r\n\r\n.Another different
    suggestion would be to add an eye to the fish head. just a small red dot in the
    fish head bones perspective; that may help the viewer to recognize it faster,
    and I guess it may add some fun too.\r\n\r\n"

    I like the idea. I'm gonna play around with it, but I'm not sure what the other
    shape would look like. I think I'd rather go safe with 1, then \"add\" another
    one, with it being easily misunderstood.\r\n\r\nDavM: I've experimented a little
    with this idea, which is great btw. It's a problem though as the piranha has eyes
    very close to the mouth, which makes the eye not even visible when the head is
    being cut off like it is in the logo.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a logo I'll continue
    to work on, I might not even need it at the moment. In not many months I'll be
    applying for several internships and showing off my portfolio, making it useless
    to apply as a company called \"Piraja Studio\", it seems alot better to apply
    as a person, using my full name. I might consider using the mark though, as I'm
    really happy with the way it's going.\r\n\r\nI'll give you a version with my name
    in it instead, so you can come with feedback on the new typography!\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thanks alot - you're all great!"
