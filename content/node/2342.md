body: 'Hello everyone,  <BR>this is a work in progress I&#39;ve done for a public
  university in brazil. <BR> <BR>The original logo, created in 1927, had one main
  element: the fire. The council behind it established it as the &#34;knowledge fire&#34;,
  the fire that burns eternally. Almost 80 years later the university wants a new
  logo but with the same concept. They want a stand alone, strong and simple symbol.
  <BR> <BR>After 2 months, this is where I am. The symbol is quite closed because
  it merges the national with the states flag, what represent literaly the name Universidade
  Federal de Minas Gerais - Federal university of &#40;the state&#41; Minas Gerais.
  And subjectively keep the symbol fire really simple. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not happy
  with the type options and I&#39;d appreciate your help and comments. Basically I&#39;ve
  chosen glypha, franklin and corporate because the &#34;g&#34; creates a support
  for the symbol. Univers as an option is merely a practical issue. The name is easy
  to remember for those who will handle the quotidian of the logo: the 40000 people
  in academic community. <BR> <BR>Let me know your opinions and suggestions.  <BR>Thank
  you all. <BR> <BR>Helder Araujo <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22023.jpg"

    but in color I&#39;m not in love with gradients. I think you should look into
    having your symbol be a tint of black rather than solid black so its not so heavy. '

    the best ratio might be condensed/normal=diamond/square.

  body: i am a former student of UFMG and i have to say that i don&#39;t think the
    logo will work for the institution unless it&#39;s all uppercase. by capitalizing
    the U you&#39;re implying a hierarchy which makes the word &#34;Universidade&#34;
    more important than &#34;Federal de Minas Gerais&#34; and as Rodolfo has said,
    it&#39;s not the correct way to treat an acronym. <BR> <BR>i would also recommend
    making the mark stronger. the symbol is very small and quiet now, it doesn&#39;t
    say &#34;fire&#34; to me at all nor it represents the University as a strong academic
    institution. it&#39;s a very nice abstraction but i think it&#39;s lacking some
    strength. <BR> <BR>as for the type solution i would agree with a condensed grotesque.
    <BR> <BR>some study of the university&#39;s architecture might inform the drawing
    of the mark as well. i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve done that or not.

  body: 'Ok. Once again Thank you all for your sugestions.  <BR> <BR>This week we
    had a meeting and we decided to go back to the all UC option. That Upper-lowercase
    option was a try to avoid a plain vanilla word mark but then we figure it could
    bores after awhile. <BR> <BR>We need a simple and timeless word mark but not ordinary.
    <BR> <BR>BOLD OR LIGHT: Well. The branding project includes several attachments
    to UFMG logo. Those will be faculties names, course, departments and events. The
    UFMG has to stand out from this second name. <BR> <BR>COLORS: Navy Blue is the
    old logo&#39;s color. The council love it but they agreed with us that it&#39;s
    difficult to keep the same pantone in all prints. So our proposal is to use cyan
    as an option to yellow or red &#40;our first proposals, both reproved&#41;. Cyan
    provides an easy reproduction in all medias and still could stand as the &#34;blue
    fire&#34;. <BR> <BR>SLABS-SERIFS-MODERNS-HUMANIST-SANS?: As you see our option
    is going toward the sans, some overused sure, but neutral and nice. If we find
    a way to customize it a bit. <BR>the sans also represents a historical link to
    UFMG since they start to be developed at late 19th and early 20th century. <BR>
    <BR>[Some modern faces are really beautiful and work corporative branding but
    didn&#39;t fit &#40;in our opinion&#41; the UFMG glyphs] <BR> <BR>SO: THESE are
    the fonts we are working on, the black ones are ours handpicks. With akzidenz
    and avant garde we have try something different putting together U and F. What
    do you all think of that and also of the other fonts? <BR> <BR>Really thanks.

    ligature. It&#39;s not working for me, it reads &#39;U&#39;&#43;something&#43;&#39;MG&#39;.
    I guess that, by eliminating the vertical stroke of F, the white space between
    F and M becomes too big, which makes it harder to read. And I think that your
    diamond-ish symbol is strong enough for the logo, you don&#39;t need &#39;extra
    attention&#39;. <BR>

    degree&#41;, which can cause some artifacts in lo-fi situations &#40;like the
    screen, or even small text on a laser printer&#41;. In which case Foundry Sans&#42;

    <BR>Foundry and  Syntax are nice i like the &#34;M&#34;s, as futura it helps the

    Thanks hrant. I&#39;ll try both.  <BR> <BR>We still have some time and if anyone

    the left leg of the M is more splayed so it will fit under the F&#41; that if
