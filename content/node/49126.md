    and the Antilles and the Netherlands technically equal parts of the Kingdom of
    the Netherlands (something that was somewhat important in a recent case here in
    Alabama involving a drunk girl who got drunk and disappeared), I would think that
    some official documents in Europe might potential require it.  Probably very few
    but just like pesetas is still shown every now and then maybe it's still used
    in Netherlands for comparing \u20AC to \u0192?  I'm sure a Dutch(wo)man on here
    could clarify more. \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas

  body: I'm Dutch, and no the florin symbol isn't used very often. It's been gone
    for about 7 years now and the only time I ever saw it again was in an old math
    book. Still, some people might use it in an angry letter to point out how much
    cheaper everything was with the "gulden" (don't know the English version). Not
    very relevant I think.

    do it.

  body: "A better question is whether the florin symbol should be replaced with the
    lowercase f with hook, since that's a letter that actually has current use in
    several African languages, and for some reason the gods of Unicode decided that
    both characters should share the same code point. Though an f with hook doesn't
    look quite like how a florin symbol is supposed to (not slanted unless it's italic
    style) I think it would be understood as a florin when used alone or against a
    string of numbers, especially in the context of text referring to pre-euro Dutch
    financials.\r\n\r\nYou could have both if you want to make an OpenType font that
    includes a linguistic substitution table."

  body: "Whether there's any point supporting the f-with-hook (instead of the florin)
    depends on whether your font supports the African languages in question. They
    require other specialized extended Latin characters beyond just that one!\r\n\r\nBut
    as the other referenced thread points out, even a pretty basic font has to have
    something in that slot, because the florin is part of MacRoman. That's why it's
    in even the most basic Adobe Latin character sets (e.g. Adobe Latin 1). http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    1 fonts, which we stopped making nine years ago. So we started making those \"missing\"
    characters standard in all our fonts at that time.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the \"symbol
    substitution\" behavior is unique to Mac OS, and unique to Type 1 fonts; it certainly
    does not happen on Windows, nor for TrueType on Mac OS, and AFAIK it does not
    occur for OpenType CFF on Mac OS either. So it really is a legacy of (single-platform)
    Mac Type 1 fonts, and not a good legacy because it resulted in getting characters
    in your text that couldn't render on other platforms.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    that aren't hard to appreciate. 1) As Chris says, it's great curve drawing practice;
    2) <strong>Because I want to</strong> I like drawing florins, because I like florins,
    and I enjoy drawing them. They're much more than just a hooked slanted f. To me
    they're italic characters. I always use a gentle slant angle and make the curves
    cursive and italicized. Sweet! 3) Technical reasons having to do with code page
    fullfillment as already stated by others.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I rarely draw
    the section glyph because not many people have a genuine use for those. It's easier
    to draw the dot def rectangle and put that in the section cell instead. Topic
