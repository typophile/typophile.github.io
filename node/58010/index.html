  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all,

I was recommended this site for logo/design critiques. I'd love some feedback.

I'm working on a new logo for a video production company that specializes in digital filmmaking and webTV, called Redhill Media. I've got a couple of concept logos in the works and was hoping to get some feedback at this stage. I'm not a logo designer by trade (though I do have a background in graphic design as a motion designer), so I'm looking for any pointers you can give me. 

Love'em? Tell me why! Hate'em? Tell me why! Can you think of a way to improve on any of them? I'd love to hear it. 

Thanks in advance,
Justin


First concept.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rm color sample 1 - brown_6456.jpg]
Added "h" ascender upon request (they like to spell it RedHill even though it's one word).

Trying to play on the "digital filmmaking" and "web/tech" aspects of the company... might be too much though.

the unfinished letters don't work for me ... but that might be personal preference than anything.

got any more background info on where the name came from, why it was chosen etc, that would help a lot in pushing the design in a great direction?

In saying that ... what you have isn't all bad (by any means) I just feel they're fairly generic outcomes ... i.e, you only started scratching the surface of the covered ideas.

There's an idea ... a scratched digital surface ... where ideas (and digital video) are uncovered.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Paul,

I've been getting a mixed reaction about the typefaces treatment. Some who really like it, others who have found it distracting. So far they like it.

Unfortunately, there isn't any more info on the name and it doesn't appear to have any special meaning (just sounded cool, I guess). I've definitely tried the "hills" idea but also didn't want to go with anything too obvious or cliched.

As it stands, the three humps ("hills" if you will) created by the "r" and "m" represent the three founders of the company. That info not obviously being apparent to anyone not in the know, but they seemed to like that idea so far. I've been trying to make the three "hills" concept more apparent in different ways, but it always comes off poorly (or at least so far).

As far as your scratched digital surface idea, though not bad (and any and all ideas are extremely appreciated right now), I'm envisioning it as a little more complexity in details than I believe to be appropriate. They've also made it apparent to me that the goals are something simplistic and iconic (they are looking for easy scalability, and detailed scratched digital surfaces are going to get funky when small). 

Maybe an abstract symbol or shape (I've tried numerous abstract hill shapes... nothing seemed to work so far though)...

Anyway... I'm still at it, so should I come up with any more interesting mockups, I'll be sure to post them.

Thanks again for your time/input!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A new "three hills" approach. I'd like to say it still resembles an "r" and an "m" as well (really more of an "s" than an "r", but can maybe work on that). Thoughts on this direction?

		<div class="commentbody">I'm thinking I like the latest concept better. Although, you may want to change the red to the middle "hill" to bring that more into the focus and reenforce the name. It does run the risk of being a little obvious. Also, is the typeface being used set in stone?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the input imavery,

I do have a red middle hill version as well (below) that does definitely work better for emphasizing the name. My desire with the left hill being red version was to try to have the hills form the "r" and "m" like before (even if only on a very abstract level). The "m" not being so hard, but as it stands the red hill obviously resembles an "s" too much. I'm still playing with it, but if it can't be done effectively I will likely go with the middle red hill (still playing with transparencies, hill shape/heights, etc. as well).

As far as the typeface, no, it is not set in stone. I am getting mixed feelings about it from different sources and am open to suggestions.

		<div class="commentbody">If you won't be able to make those hills readable, then the middle one should be red. But if you do make it, than you'll have to make the first one red.

But. If you go in the direction of hills, simplify type. Don't use those unfinished strokes, because you do need just one symbol in your logo, not more. Logos with more than one emphasized visual specialities tend to be confusing.

Bu beside all these. I like the hills approach much more.
