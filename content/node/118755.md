  and narrow aperture capital  \"S\" (similar to the commercial Studebaker but with
  a longer shelf ).\r\n\r\nDiscovered on a postcard for the \"Fairyland Service Station\",
  later \"Cornerstone Service Station\", now a Starbuck's, located caddy-corner to
  the entrance to Rock City, Lookout Mtn.\r\n\r\nThere's no evidence the signage was
  never a part of the physical structure, to my knowledge, and was likely added by
  hand to the colorized photo used for the souvenir postcard bearing its name.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/postcard

  body: "All great suggestions. Thank you. The weighting is comparable for all three,
    but the adjacent stroke vectors for the first two are a little too acute.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thanks for the info!\r\n\r\n"
