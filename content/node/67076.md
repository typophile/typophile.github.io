  is not a sans serif, but there could be a lot to do for everybody: not just ligatures,
  but language variants; cyrillics, and Greek. I've done some lower case ligtures,
  but upper case is untouched. And upper to lower case.\r\n"

  body: This is a really nice idea for a design, and perhaps a better choice for collaborative
    work than a sans serif. Anyone can add a clever idea for a ligature, or combine
    existing ligatures. Plus, I find designing serifs more forgiving than sans serifs.

  body: "Yes, I think Brian does have a point, and this font was really just for a
    study of ligatures, so I'm happy to put this up for Typophile font, and see where
    it goes.\r\n\r\nThere are many ligatures I've made I don't like, so feel free
    to do over everything. And if anybody has a solution to make a ligature ending
    with 'a', I'd like to see that.\r\n\r\nSo, where should I put the .fvb-file?\r\n\r\nAnd
    who is the first to take it over?"

    a decent scheme in that other thread. But I personally would have no hard feelings
    if the collective willpower is not strong enough to make this happen. I certainly
    don't want only 2-3 of us actually doing this. For one thing, I don't have <em>that</em>
    much free time. But most of all, to me at least this is sort of a \"social experiment\",
    so it would have to be highly collaborative to be interesting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I agree. We should have a fair number of people participating on this. We
    have Cyrillic glyphs promised, and I should think we can get Greek glyphs as well.\r\n\r\nNow,
    what we need is designers. To take the font file and work it. And then give it
    to the next designer.\r\n\r\nHow do we do that?"

  body: "Simplicity is useful. But I think the simplicity of taking turns working
    on the font would be fatally prohibitive.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest we have a central,
    semi-public repository of primarily* font files and text files. Each font file
    would be named in a way that indicates what existing font it's an extension/modification
    of (see that other thread), and the text files (which could actually be judiciously
    Subject-ed emails) would mostly explain who did what.\r\n\r\n* It would also be
    useful to have EPS/PDF files for evaluation.\r\n\r\nSo a person could look through
    the font files and the text files, decide where/how to jump in, and make new font/text
    files. And the whole time we'd be showing our work-in-progress on Typophile for
    feedback on which branch(es) to pursue.\r\n\r\nBut this is your baby, so if you
    have a totally different idea that's fine, and in any case I'll help with whatever
    time I can find.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to John Hudson; after some sleep and things like common sense, UFO in fact looks
    like a very good way to get this going, with the people behind it.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I have a .vfb-file waiting for updating :\xB7)"
