  I was wondering about Bezi\xE9r this morning.\r\nWhat mathematical formular in terms
  of f(x) = x hides behind it?\r\nMost interesting for the derivation functions, the
  ones of the second and third degree that may determine the forms character.\r\nIs
  it possible (in case - maybe I am totally wrong. Forgot all about maths ;-) to change
  it?\r\nCould it be possible to get an alternative curve more soft and round?\r\nI\u2019d
  love to have it.\r\n\r\nStefan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-1_3959.gif]"

  body: "The key thing about cubic Bezier curves is that you can do S shapes between
    two points, which quadratic curves cannot. This makes it easier for drawing, as
    you can use fewer points, and use the handles to get the shape you want. \r\n\r\nCubic
    Beziers are limited in the curves you can get, but you can closely approximate
    other curves between two points by adding intermediate points. The same idea is
    done with quadratic curves, where cubic curves are translated to quadratic automatically
    for True Type outlines by adding intermediate points. So you have more segments
    drawn with quadratic formulas that end up closely approximating the original cubic
    curve. \r\n\r\nHere on Typophile, Raph Levien has published his [[http://www.typophile.com/node/33531|new
    drawing tool called Spiro.]] It is based on a special spiral, and does straight
    to round curves with a smoother and more natural curve. After drawing with the
    spiral tool, the application then can automatically convert the curves to cubic
    Beziers, adding intermediate points. There are links on the thread to the tool,
    as it now exists.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey William,\r\n\r\nthanks! I know about Raphs developements and believe
    me or not, without knowing about it before, I recognized something special in
    his font redesigns as Centaur or Zeno. They have a very \u2013 how to say? - lovely
    quality. I tried to install his software but it didn\u2019t work on my system
    (10.3.9) I think he has excellent ideas but its sometimes hard to get information
    from him. Apparently he isn\u2019t so much into typophile at the moment. Or maybe
    disappointed by some reactions on his ideas.\r\nI am convinced that somehting
    in Bezi\xE9r is quite crank. All above near to the tangent points curves are too
    steep. Making intermediate points weakens the design specially when resolution
    is not big enough. You can get better results using intermediates making very
    very large designs, yet they don\u2019t fit in later or have to be recalculated
    with the same disturbing results. Did you personally never had the idea that the
    digital curves cannot catch up with organic forms? I can spend days trying to
    tune a curve for example in the belly of a minor \u2018a\u2019 or similar.\r\nI
    know your point of view that it depends more in the effect of type in masses but
    isn\u2019t it that a defect that is of a so general nature infects the whole atmosphere
    of a typeface also? \r\nDid you ever had the strange (not clearly to define) impression
    that digital type even the most brillant ones look kind of \u201Dstretched\u201D.
    I am reading at the moment a book for example in a new digital Baskerville. Not
    the slick ones made after the DTP came up, no, the good ones nowadays in use.
    It is so perfect that my eye seems to be torn through the lines without concentrating
    on the content. If I read an old italian paperback, made with a strange old Linotype
    Garamond with its letters bouncing up and down, the enjoy of reading is so much
    deeper and easier for the eye. And I think its not because of the differences
    of typefaces - I mean families and so on - but because of the main difference
    between digital and analog form.\r\nAnd apart from irregularities that play an
    important part (a good one) in that I think it depends also on the Bezi\xE9r characteristic.
    Excuse my bad English!\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "PS\r\nMaybe its not so much a problem of the curves (if one could use intermediates
    without destroying the design) but of the restraint of digital raster. You know
    the difference between making a decision on the point as we do by hand and not
    only making decisions between one unit up or down or left or right as we do by
    handling tangents or other systems.\r\n\r\nStefan"
