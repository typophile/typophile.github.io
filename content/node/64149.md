  it? Specifically, I have some pencil-drawn lettering that I want to make vector.
  Normally I would scan it and use something like the Live Trace feature in Illustrator.
  Is that the best/only way? Any suggestions at all - even your thoughts on the the
  best paper/ink/pencil combo prior to scanning and helpful hints. I would appreciate
  it SO much!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nNatalie"

    isn't much of a deal, and you have control on the number of points.\r\n\r\nFor
    most cases, it's quicker to redraw than to raster it and correct it; and it looks
    way better.\r\n\r\nIf your searching for something grungy, or distorted, just
    raster it in Illustrator, that would do the trick. :) "

  body: "I've used Illustrator and ScanFont, both of which have a wide range of sensitivity
    settings. The settings are very particular to the size and quality of your scanned
    image.\r\n\r\nMy view is that sometimes drawing a vector over a raster scan is
    a good idea.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes it is better to use Live Trace or ScanFont.
    If your sketch is big and accurate with clean edges, you might be able to get
    it pretty close. But if it's a small pencil drawing on rough paper... it might
    be best to non-Live trace.\r\n\r\nBut it is true that auto-tracing is rarely 100%
    accurate."

  body: I seem to remember in a magazine, Comm Arts or Computer Arts maybe, a small
    article about a program that created much more realistic vectors than the LiveTrace
    in Illustrator. I'm not sure I can track it down...I'll try.

  body: Vector Magic? It's pretty good. It's a web service and Illustrator plug-in.
    But it does cost money. (That's not a bad thing).

  body: "I used the web service when they were beta testing it. It was fairly remarkable.
    Again, simplifying what you put in makes a major difference in the quality of
    the output but regardless Vector Magic was better than the live trace functionality
    as I recall. I'm sorry I don't have art work to show you the differences. Oh and
    the URL for folks:\r\nhttp://vectormagic.com/"
