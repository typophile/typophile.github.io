body: "Background: I created the font pictured here as the basis for a logo by manipulating
  [[http://www.dafont.com/samarkan.font|Samarkan]], mostly by removing the horizontal
  line across the top. The client, an event planner, wants an exotic but not specifically
  ethnic feel. Mehndi-inspired decoration will appear in the logo as well -- again,
  trying not to be too specifically Indian but using similar flourishes.\r\n\r\nQuestion:
  If you were asked to put the subtitle \"custom designed events\" below the company
  name, what secondary typefaces would you try?\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heading_6622.jpg]"

  body: Thanks, Dav. I was originally thinking of something wide, in the same style
    as Century Gothic, so that it could span the width of the word Panache while remaining
    in a small point size. Do you think this would be a bad idea?
