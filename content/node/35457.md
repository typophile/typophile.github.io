  so as not to miss out on anything - so would be greatful if anyone knew of any exhibitions,
  galleries, places of interest, really anything to do with graphic design and typography
  (and anything connected to female typographers) anything a bit more off the beaten
  track of a travel guide.\r\n\r\nREALLY appreciate the guidance. searching the internet
  runs me in cirlces\r\n\r\n\r\nLindsayy"

    on the canal. Look at the internet for directions (map).

    says that it's on Da Costakade, but I'm not sure that information is up to date.
    Anyway you should definitely make an appointment beforehand."

    (old and new). They are located at the Staalstraat. Googlemap here:\r\nhttp://www.nijhoflee.nl/bookstore/\r\nEnjoy

    beautiful than Amsterdam, and of course with photogenic streetsigns. Some of the
    university buildings have poetry and literary passages in various languages written
    on them in big letters. \r\n\r\nIn Amsterdam a canal boat tour will give you a
    basic intro to some architectural and city history. \r\n"
