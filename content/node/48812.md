body: "hi.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a sans serif typeface that has real italics, and
  a \"feeling\" similar to Din or Gotham. Basically something that is very readable
  and allows enough richness in a page that combines regular and italics. It needs
  not to have a strong presence of itself due to subject. For book on Aids.\r\n\r\nRecomendations
  are most welcome.\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nG."

    have, to my taste, true italics, neither true small caps.\r\nI have considered
    Klavika, and will check on the other suggestions.\LThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    original criteria (at least, as I understood it) was quite purposeful.\r\nWhere
    does Figgins fall short for you?"

  body: "Nick. Figgins does not fall short at all. It actually exceeds my needs. A
    beautiful font, but for this particular project, i think the italic feels too
    texturized, rhythmic. What turns me out of it it is that it feels to masculine
    for this project, on the regular style, and too playful on the italic characters.
    I think i need something more contained, specially to fit the taste of my two
    clients and subject.\r\nAll this comment are made with my deepest respect. Hope
    you find the too.\r\n\r\nI am in the tries in between Gotham and Whitney. I am
    not thrilled by Gotham's italics for this job, preferring Whitney's.\r\n"

    Will consider with detail, as for what I see now, it is a very close match, and
    great font.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    come to mind as DIN lookalikes with italics.
