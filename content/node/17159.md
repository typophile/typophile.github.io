  is a lettering font intended for architects drawings. It is inspired by the standardized
  typeface \"ISO\", but with a blurred and yet geometric look. All three weights are
  derived from the same strokes - only line thickness vary.\r\nI would very much appreciate
  comments on the glyph designs. (Haven't worked on spacing yet.)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: It is most interesting in the lightest weight as that is where the "blown-out"
    look appears the most. Could be fun for display purposes. The boldest weight seems
    the least interesting as it is the most normal.

  body: "The light weight looks like the regular run thru a bold filter with negative
    paramaters, eg: vertical -20, horizontal -20, or similar. I like the regular and
    bold because they're true to the stroke you get from an ISO stencil traced with
    a technical pen. That's just my personal preference; they're more satisfying to
    my mind than the light. \r\n\r\nMiss Tiffany is right tho---the light weight is
    the most interesting, more visually stimulating and intriguing because the structures
    are alluded to with the loose-fitting \"blown-out\" finish, my term for that is
    usually \"eroded\".\r\n\r\nFor the light weight I recommend reducing the goop
    in the crevices and nooks of the diagonals, and the <strong>t</strong> and <strong>f</strong>
    junctions. Make it just a bit cleaner without losing the eroded charm. It looks
    too much like the product of a bold filter in reverse; rework it to make it look
    like the work of human hands.\r\n\r\nThe top bar of the Euro is longer in keeping
    with the defacto structure of Euro symbols. Extend it forward a bit more to exaggerate
    and make that structure clearer.\r\n\r\nOne question to consider if this is going
    to be a commercial release: Are there many other ISO-style fonts around? I only
    had enuff time to find one --- http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/isonorm/\r\n\r\nj

    of realism. Clean strokes aren't what you'd get from a real technical pen tracing
    a stencil. The blurry outlines are not true to ink & pen effects, but they suggest
    those artefacts.\r\n\r\nThe work required to make a clean version would be equivalent
    to rebuilding the font from scratch, producing a font that already has many rivals.\r\n\r\nOne
    option you could try is reworking the irregularities to differentiate them. That

  body: "<em>I\u2019m not convinced though about the idea of creating irregularities
    \u2014 do you think I would still be able to keep the geometric look?</em>\r\n\r\nDefinitely.
    It shouldn't be a problem as long as you keep the letter structures as they are.
    The finish (surface detail) can be modulated without flipping the design as a
    whole out of its basic genre. It will still be geometric as long as you keep the
    surface detail subtle.\r\n\r\n<em>Something I would like to do is adding more
    colour to the characters without joints or corners e.g. \u2018O\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019
    as they now all look too skinny. Any suggestions on how?</em>\r\n\r\nVary the
    stroke width on those letters a bit. You could make the variations abstract, or
    shape the strokes to look like natural variations in line thickness you'd get
    from a technical pen. Also try adding blobs: \"O\" can take a blob inline that
    would look like an accumulation of ink at the point where the pen started tracing,
    or where the pen stopped; the blob could be elongated (long). For \"S\", maybe
    thicken up the stroke in one part, along the diagonal spine or in one of the curves;
    or put a blob at either end of the stroke, one smaller than the other; or a combination
    of thickened stroke and blob(s).\r\n\r\n<em>Do the weights work? Regular has the
    thickness approximately 1/10 of the Cap height = 60 units. Light=36 and Bold=96.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    weights are good because they're different enough to make a clear difference in
    use. In a text setting the reader's eye would see a positive difference in weight.\r\n\r\n<strong>Atom</strong>
    is much more \"jarred\", stylized and individual, but the stylization is a bit
    too forced or superficial for my taste. How much you jarr a font depends on how
    specialized you want it to be, and limits its uses. Your Miso is fairly normal
    (standard forms), and you might want to think about stylizing it more to make
    it stand out and give it its own unique appeal. But that will take time and experiment.
    One quick mod is to make some of the bowls on p, q, g different sizes; pull one
    or two of them up from the baseline; bowl letters don't have align exactly with
    the baseline and x-line; make the size variation small and people don't notice,
    but it helps make the font interesting. Also consider adding curls to some letters,
    like l, i, k, h, m, n, u. \r\n\r\nAll the best with this face M\xE5rten \r\n\r\n\r\nj

    using varying stroke width would do the job. Perhaps ink blobs would be to stretch

    like it was actually hand drawn and scanned (perhaps this is not what you meant).\r\n\r\nThe
    way I'll try to do it -- technically -- is to actually draw two strokes next to
    each other where I want i thicker line. These two lines may also differ slightly
    in angle.\r\n\r\nJust for reference I'm posting two ISO examples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nestler-ISO-stencil.png]\r\nThe
    first example is (obviously) hand drawn with a stencil, deliberately clumsy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Autodesk-ISO-CP.png]\r\nThe

    those from the CAD. Monostroke typefaces are generally boring because they are
    too perfect, the geometry leaves no room for imperfection. And we all know --

    One does this normally with the x-height, rather than with the baseline (bold

  body: "> One does this normally with the x-height, rather than with the baseline\r\n\r\nYes,
    because:\r\n1) The baseline is more of a fixed thing in typography,\r\nboth visually
    and in terms of \"protocol\" so to speak.\r\n2) There are more serifs (horizontal
    elements) on the baseline.\r\n\r\nBTW, when it <cite>is</cite> done at the x-line:
    it's to compensate for the optical illusion of darker forms looking shorter, not
    to somehow center things; and doing so causes the darker parts to be higher by
    a lot less than what centering would do (so most of the shift is towards the inside
    of the x-height).\r\n\r\nHere's a somewhat related discussion:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15204\r\n\r\nI
    think M\xE5rten's idea could work -in fact well- if the font as\r\na whole is

  body: "> This gives me an idea: maybe font weights should\r\nbe priced according
    to their distance from Regular?\r\n\r\nThe first second or so after I read this
    I thought it was rather absurd, but there is some logic in there. I just wonder
    why Black or Thin should cost more than Regular. I think maybe the 3 master weights
    should be the same price and the further you get away from those, the lower the
    price gets.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nThin \u2014 $25 (master weight)\r\nExtra Light
    \u2014 $22\r\nLight \u2014 $20\r\nRegular \u2014 $25 (master weight)\r\nMedium
    \u2014 $22\r\nSemibold \u2014 $20\r\nBold \u2014 $22\r\nBlack \u2014 $25 (master
    weight)\r\nUltra Black \u2014 $22\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's normal to consider
    'Black' the master weight when there is another weight thicker than that but that's
    besides the point. It only kind of works in very large font families though. I
    actually think if there will be variation in the price for fonts within a font
    family then they should be priced according to demand, shouldn't they?\r\n\r\nFor
    example:\r\nThin \u2014 $20\r\nExtra Light \u2014 $15\r\nLight \u2014 $20\r\nRegular
    \u2014 $25\r\nMedium \u2014 $20\r\nSemibold \u2014 $20\r\nBold \u2014 $25\r\nBlack
    \u2014 $20\r\nUltra Black \u2014 $15\r\n\r\nIt actually kind of follows the system
    I just explained but it takes Regular and Bold as the primary and most essential
    weights and pretty much the further you go away from those master weights the
    lower the price because people just don't use them often; the exception would
    be 'Thin' because it's useful for display purposes. What do you think?"
