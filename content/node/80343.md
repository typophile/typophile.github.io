body: "I found another thread that discussed legal issues with fonts but it didn't
  quite deal with my specific question and since I was still confused, I decided to
  just go ahead and ask the experts!!\r\n\r\nCan fonts be legally used to create word
  art that would be sold as either bmp. files or .png files for digital scrapbooking?
  \ Or are you crossing the copyright laws?  In particularly with regards to free
  fonts?  \r\n\r\nAlso, if you do happen to purchase a commercial license of a font,
  does that give you freedom to create word art?  \r\n\r\nIs this even an issue since
  the image is raterized and from what I read on the other post it is only the font
  software that would be the issue?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!!"

  body: Almost every EULA (End User License Agreement) permit to do that. But you
    should always check the EULA for every font you want to use. Normally you can
    read the EULA before you purchase a license or when you download the font (free
    fonts).

  body: "Great question.\r\n\r\nNote: These discussions require strict recognition
    of the semantic distinction between the words font and typeface.\r\n\r\nDealing
    with U.S. law, there is virtually no protection of typefaces. Once the font leaves
    a computer it becomes just a typeface and it also leaves legal protections, i.e.,
    there is legal font protection, but no typeface protection.  There is certainly
    room to argue a dispute of that, but only in theory. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s
    a single legal precedent in the U.S. that counters that statement. The legal protections
    that have been enforced are very circuitous, weak and strictly related to fonts
    not typefaces. Plus even the potential monetary rewards from pursuing a case of
    violation are, in almost every case, trivial. The cost to pursue legal action
    would cost far more than any reward, except when the offender has seen a significant
    gain from the violation or has a lot of wealth.   \r\n\r\nI feel for font designers
    having a bad deal in the U.S. It\u2019s not fair at all that other intellectual
    property is given some strong protection, and type designs aren\u2019t. As it
    is now, EULAs offer very limited legal protection of the typeface. It can restrict
    what you do on the computer, but that\u2019s as far as it goes. I think even EULA
    restrictions against using a font in a logo are easily trumped by making a few
    modifications to the typeface. In that case it\u2019s no longer even derivative
    of the font, but is an original work as a new typeface. It sucks for the type
    designer, but that\u2019s not just the way it is, that\u2019s that way it\u2019s
    always been. \r\n\r\nRegarding your specific question, if your word is a BMP or
    PNG, then it\u2019s a typeface and not a font. There is no copyright protection
    in the U.S. for typefaces and never has been. The only legal protection, which
    as I\u2019ve stated above is at best very, very weak, is to say that the digital
    font was integrally used and essential in the creation of the BMP or PNG and therefore
    it is restricted to the EULA. That would be a very hard, and relatively expensive,
    case for someone to prosecute. \r\n\r\n[[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=UNESCO_Font_Lic|http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=UNESCO_Font_Lic]]"
