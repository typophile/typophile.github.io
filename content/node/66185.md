  Inkscape.\r\nThere was once a thread about calligraphy software and I am sure Inkscape
  is one of the best. It works different then CorelDraw and Illustrator but I think
  is more close to the traditional way except the strokes can be rearranged if necessary.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/600

  body: Well, I'm not by any means a pro on calligraphy, but I think this looks great.
    I'm not typically a fan of effects on type or logos, so I'd love to see what this
    looks like as a simple black on white, but the effect you have here is actually
    quite neat and does work with the calligraphy. My only critique would be that
    the T seems a little lost. I seem to recall much more stylized Ts in other calligraphy
    I've seen. I absolutely LOVE the K and the S though. Nice work on those!

  body: "I think you are right so I have saved it also as a simple B&W image.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your comment.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some problem with uploading images
    to comments, maybe it's my computer or browser that's wrong.\r\nAnyway I have
    placed them as attachments to the original post.\r\nThey are also inserted in
    the post but they are not visible.\r\nPlease click on their names to see them.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again.\r\n"
