  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Typohiles,</p>
<p>We have been working with a UK Insurance company over the last couple years assisting them with  their new brand.  Up until last week, they had more or less decided that they were going to implement FF Meta on a corporate wide basis.  One of their Marketing team was then sent a TrueType font called Lexus Opti.  We compared Lexus Opti with FF Meta, and the resemblance bewtween the two typefaces was uncanny. Now I became very suspicious that someone had just basically saved Meta and renamed it as Lexus Opti and passed it off as their own design!</p>
<p>I have since learnt that Opti fonts are in fact valid commercial fonts, but they have not been updated in the last 15 years, and would not be supported.</p>
<p>I need to come up with some further argument points for our customer, not to go with Lexus, but
embrace FF Meta.</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me with this, with regards to the technical unsuitability of the Opti fonts and provide a history of this range of Opti typefaces.</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you</p>
<p>Kind regards
Neil

<p>Let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;valid commercial font&rdquo; is a stretchable concept, when one considers 
their collection consists largely of rip-offs and pirated designs. I suppose you don&rsquo;t buy your Rolex watch from a suspicious street vendor neither. :^)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Lexus Opti is probably FF Meta, just renamed. Meta is the corporate font for the Lexus brand, and about 18 months ago i made special kerning pairs on behalf of the agency&rsquo;s art director in LA. I suppose they paid a license to FSI which gives them the right to rename the font. It does not, however, give anyone the right to sell the font under this new name. The copy you have is thus a double rip-off: someone stole it from Lexus or their agency who have signed a contract which only licenses it to them. So Lexus could get sued by FSI, and whoever copied the font could be sued both by Lexus and by FSI.</p>
<p>Anyway: how could you even consider using a font for business whose legal provenance you cannot ensure? “One of their Marketing team was then sent a TrueType font” - what sort of procurement is that? Tell you client to stay away from illegal software, as it’ll cost them. Especially now that i know about it.</p>

<p>Meta was first designed for the German Post Office in 1985 and called PT55, and then redigitized for my design company, MetaDesign, in 1990 and named thus. Check my blog at <a href="http://www.spiekermann.com">www.spiekermann.com</a> for an article on the excat history. That makes it 20 years.</p>

<p>thank you, and thanks to Jürgen Siebert for alerting me to this thread.</p>
<p>I am surprised – nay: apalled – at the lack of initiative by some of the designers out there. How difficult can it be in the age of Google or myfonts.com to find out the name of the original designer? And then write to me directly to get proper facts rather than all sorts of hearsay? Not all type designers are dead and you don’t even have to go to the library or the bookshelf, like I have to when I do my research for the upcoming new edition of the FontBook. It is so easy to find at least the first traces, but you cannot rely onn the web entirely, not even on wiki. There’s too much copy-and-pasting going on. And mistakes are just as easily copied as true facts. Get a lead, then do you own fact checking. Never rely on the first source that comes along. Even Myfonts.com just publishes what they come by, and that is not necessarily always true. Nobody can double- and treble check all the 30,000 plus fonts out there, but at least we try.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious, are you sure?
Does the contract say they&rsquo;re responsible for third-party piracy?
That seems like a contract nobody would [knowingly] sign.</p>

<p>In fact, I just got a job in from a not-to-be-named outside vendor that used OPTIDianna, which is a rip-off of Elsner+Flakes Ballantines faces. We were able to stop that one in its tracks. We ordered Ballantines for ourselves and forced our vendor to do the same. Score one for the font police.</p>

<p>When Nike started making a line of &ldquo;Verdana&rdquo; ladies golf gloves* and bags, out of interest I asked our TM people if it was kosher. I was advised that as an unrelated product there wasn&rsquo;t much we could do.</p>
<p>But this seems different - McDonalds shot down at least one McFont with nastygram letters, I&rsquo;m sure Lexus could do the same thing.</p>

<p>Funny. They <em>appear</em> to be the remnants of an old compnay that used to do type casting here in Chicago. One of the presses I ocassionally work on has some Monotype-cast handset that I think came from them.</p>
<p>While the 18-point Lydian we have is the worst casting of a typeface I think I&rsquo;ve ever seen, I&rsquo;m a bit shocked that these folks would be engaged in the seedy underbelly of font piracy. I guess Chicago&rsquo;s gone to the dogs.</p>

<p>Well I have some good news.  After conveying the information to customer, they have now placed an order for a 5000 seat license for four weights of FF Meta.  This really is such a great forum, and am so pleased that I posted the orginal message.</p>
<p>I would like to personally thank everyone especially Erik, and Hrant (for protecting me) and all the rest for their input.</p>

<p>That company has a legacy of font piracy going way back before digital type. &ldquo;Type Films of Chicago,&rdquo; part of the same company, offered a huge library of duplicated and renamed (&ldquo;similar to&rdquo;) film fonts which they sold to type houses. If you look at one of their old catalogs, you can even spot a character here and there that is backwards or upside down or the wrong weight. The originators of some fonts did this to determine who, among their customers, were pirates.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Don&rsquo;t know if adding to this four years later makes sense, but I just came upon it, and Mark&rsquo;s on the mark. I used to work a few doors down from OptiFonts (officially Type Films of Chicago) when their office was downtown (later moved to Chicago suburb, still operating at the second location many years later, if not still now). They sold everything from metal to film to digital fonts back then, virtually all pirated. One story I heard decades ago was how they went about pirating Headliners fonts, discovered by employees of the local Headliners franchise (The Chicago Franchise Co.). They&rsquo;d order headlines set as if they were a legitimate type shop customer. One day, while setting one of the fonts stored as single character films, they realized they had used EVERY character and alternate. So they (Opti) were cut off, generally to try to continue as another customer, in Chicago or elsewhere.</p>
<p>As to their digital copies, many are quite badly constructed fonts, rescanned and renamed to get around lax US legal restrictions. Regardless of how they LOOK, open in a font editor and see that most characters have dozens to hundreds of extra points in their outlines, some so bad they&rsquo;ll crash hi res RIPs. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the original, the underlying outline drawing is probably the best way to determine, barring exact digital dupes, whether you&rsquo;re dealing with a pirate or an original foundry or designer. And in the case of OptiFonts, another giveaway for some is to be suspicious of font names of locations or stuff related to India &amp; S. Asia.</p>
