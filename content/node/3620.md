body: Guys, <BR> <BR>Well, I&#39;m not a professional and I&#39;m stuck with this
  project. I can&#39;t think of a descent numerals and &#34;Z&#34; character. Also,
  the &#34;S&#34; is pretty ugly &#40;heh&#41;...be cruel, but please - help me with
  some hints.  <BR> <BR>Thanks<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28671.gif"

  body: It seems like you&#39;re trying to &#34;cram&#34; an even stroke through a
    rather low x-height with the &#34;s&#34;, and you would probably have to with
    the &#34;z&#34; also. <BR> <BR>What I would suggest is either cleverly play with
    angles or make the middle stroke&#39;s weight thinner. <BR> <BR>Also, consider
    giving the &#34;k&#34; &#40;and your to-be &#34;z&#34;&#41; more-or-less straight
    diagonals, it&#39;s okay to have some unique members in a set. <BR> <BR>Overall,
    this is a really neat style. What about that &#34;a&#34;? It looks a bit off...
    <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: 'Hi Ivan, <BR> <BR>Some points: <BR> <BR>1. Nice forms, maybe a bit too constructed
    for my taste. <BR> <BR>a: My opnion: Try to distinguish it a little more  from
    the six. Give him the foot it needs <BR> <BR>i,j: stems should be same height
    <BR> <BR>k: perhaps give the upper arm an angle <BR> <BR>s: the spine is way to
    light as it is right now.  But it&#39;s overall too constructed. Get away from
    a fixed witdh perhaps. Draw! <BR> <BR>t: make the horizontal stroke a little thinner
    <BR> <BR>u,y: too wide, should be a little more condensed than the n. <BR> <BR>x:
    too horizontal. make it a little more condensed <BR> <BR>For all joins &#40;connection
    curve/stem&#41;: make the outline a little lighter there. You might even consider
    trapping. But I&#39;m sure the man from the lambic valley will help you on this
    issue. <BR> <BR>This for the beginning.  <BR> <BR>Servus  <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR>'
