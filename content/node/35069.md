body: "Hey!\r\nI'm currently writing a parser for the TrueType file format for a project
  I'm doing. I don't need all the tables present in the TT standard, and everything
  I've parsed so far has worked out nicely. Now I'm battling with the glyf-table,
  which I just can seem to get right!\r\n\r\nWhen I parse this table, everything works
  as expected as long as there are no blank glyphs (zero contours (spaces etc)). Sometime
  when my parser hits a blank glyph it gets out of synch, which of course has devastating
  effects...\r\n\r\nThe files I'm parsing don't have composite glyphs, so I don't
  have to worry about that (contour values = -1).\r\n\r\nI think I've localized the
  error. If I look at my font in a hex editor I can see that the blank glyphs do not
  have a full glyph-header (n_contours, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max). Instead they
  seem to have an arbitrary (usually 1-3) byte entries which are zero, and then the
  next glyph on comes right after that.\r\nFor instance, a blank glyph in a hex editor
  looks like this:\r\n\r\n... 05 e6 fa 1a    |    00    |    00 01 01 AA ...\r\n\r\nThe
  first part is the en parts of the previous glyph. This seems to be correct - I get
  the right point values and flags for it.\r\n\r\nThe middle part is a single 0 entry,
  and that's all I can find from the blank glyph.\r\n\r\nThe last part first says
  0001 countours, which is correct, and 01AA xMin which is also correct for the following
  glyph. As you can see, the middle glyph, which is a blank glyph, only has one single
  entry... no full 5 Short value glyf-header!\r\n\r\nI have no clue why that is! For
  a while I thought the varying amount of zero entries were some kind of allignment
  padding in the file, but that doesn't seem right...\r\n\r\nI'm thankful for any
  help I can get to help me out here!\r\nThanks in advance!!\r\n\r\n/Magnus"

  body: "It's hard to say for sure without seeing the rest of the font data, but I
    would guess that what you're calling the data for the blank glyph *is* in fact
    padding at the end of the first glyph. There can be 0 - 3 pad bytes at the end
    of each glyph's data, depending on the length of the data and 'loca' format ('indexToLocFormat'
    value from the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/head.htm|'head' table]]).\r\n\r\nAre
    you reading the 'loca' table to obtain each glyph's offset and length within the
    'glyf' table? I would be surprised to see such results if so, as it would indicate
    corruption (as an aside: if you haven't already verified the integrity of the
    data, you should consider doing so with [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/FontValidator.mspx|Font
    Validator]] or other utility). Truly blank glyphs will have a length of zero.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're not using the 'loca' values...well, you need to. The 'glyf' table data
    is meaningless without the 'loca'.\r\n"
