body: In two weeks, I only used $20 of printing credit. I have two more weeks to use
  another $130. A color tabloid-size print costs $1.50, and a large format plot costs
  $10 per foot. I'd like to print a bunch of cool tabloid-size posters to hang in
  my room, but I'm having trouble finding very many.
