    other letters were ever done in this style. In my years of looking for blackletter
    fonts I have never seen anything close. It would make a great font. A distant

  body: "Don, now THAT is a project that certain political circles would embrace.
    Not much revenue in it, I (hope/think).\r\n\r\nBTW A couple of months ago I saw
    Riefenstahl's first billing as an actress (a silent movie) and it was a wonderfully
    funny to begin with and also she was quite ravishing, her being a timeless beauty
    \u2014 almost fell in love with her... Not much type in that movie, though."

  body: "Well Bert, use of a particular style of lettering in a Nazi propaganda film
    would seem to be the kiss of death for a font based on it, unless there was some
    way to de-Nazify the context. Before the mid 1940s some \"jackboot\" blackletters
    were widely used as an \"alpine style\" to advertise mountain resorts in North
    America. \r\nHeavy metal rock bands, bikers, etc. love punchy blackletters. But
    I have no idea what would actually work as a marketing strategy to kick the Nazi
    elephant out of the room.\r\nDon\r\n"
