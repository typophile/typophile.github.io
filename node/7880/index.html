I hope the sketch is tight enough to show the direction in which i would like to go. Two things I want to find out; the first is wether this project is even worth pursuing and second, do the letters have a certain harmony to them ( please try to ignore the letter 's' in your examination as i have not spent much time developing it  and consider it 'unfinished').  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54539.jpg" alt=" type sketches"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some very interesting glyphs you have for a starting point. I may be wrong, but I am guessing that you have been looking at a lot of fonts you really like (including Lux typographics/ Esquire magazines Crank8 font for the second &quot;k&quot;. and perhaps work from UK's The Foundry as well. I am NOT suggesting that you should not use these as starting points, nor that the work is &quot;copied&quot; but I do think it it influenced and there is nothing wrong with that. Did you ( like I have done myself in the past) decided if only I could fit all these unusual tweaks into a single font it would be the &quot;ultimate&quot;. Seems like a <BR>great idea. Well be careful, for it become a very difficult task. Hrant gave me very good advice once, which was &quot;be careful of glyph love&quot;. And by the way I really like the glyphs you have here regardless of where the ideas came from .   <BR>Is it worth persuing? Yes. Next step is unification. &quot;o&quot; is very cool but will not fit with rest. The more tweaks the less userbility.</div>

I thought I could 'start from scratch' (if there is such a thing). But I must admit that at a subconscious level I was influenced. I had no idea of the similarities! But I do admit the second 'k' was seen in the Esquire magazine i subcribe too. I just love it. You're right about 'o' it does not fit, sometimes i get carried away. I will take your advice to heart about the tweaks on each glyph. Too much does hinder userbility. what do u think about the 'g' , 'b' and 'd' do they fit? I think they might be off.

I honestly thought that not looking at other sources for inpiration might  help in avoiding this kind of 'confusion' in terms giving my design it's own identity.  <BR> <BR>Well 'A' , to answer your question I guess they are some similarities to the fon't Solex, but i feel my design might be just different enough to 'stand out'. <BR> <BR>To be honest with you I feel like I have this all wrong now.  How does one design great typefaces that stand out and not look like everything else? Can such thing be accomplished? I hope there is someone out there with advice that can help me. I really feel like I have the potential for good type design ( I know this because of the love i have for the printed word and typography) and i don't want to give up on this! <BR> <BR>Any advice <BR>Ivan M</div>

This style is in the air, I guess. But what you have so far can still serve as a great starting point I think.
