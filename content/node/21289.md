  ago the The New Yorker magazine. Anyone know who it was about? What issue it was
  in? (Apparently the New Yorker doesn't believe in having an online index to their
  magazine issues, so I found nothing with any searches there or with Google.)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n-

    long ago.\r\n\r\nChris, nice poster, but 'Trajan'? Why not 'Galliard', or something
    designed by Carter?\r\n \r\n- Mike Yanega"

    would be perfect here. The anti-Trajan by the Man himself."

  body: "Thanks guys. \r\nWhy Trajan? Two reasons: one, it was the font used in the
    original \"Rockstar\" movie; two, it is such a clich\xE9 movie font.  I guess
    I was going more for comedy than for something that was done by Matthew (three,
    I don't have Mantinia:-) although now I see how gorgeous it is, I am tempted to
    buy it!).\r\n\r\n\"...best things to happen to Typophile in \u201805.\" Does that
    mean I have outstayed my welcome? :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    thing to happen in '06 was image upload.

    you have hit on a sore point for me! Image upload only works with new operating
    systems. Mac OS9 doesn't cut it any more, but the 'old' Typophile could handle
    it just fine. It's techno-discrimination I tell you!\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    at the expensive of the few. I'll bet the population of Typophile OS9 users doesn't
    exceed 5%. \r\n\r\nSadly, you're worth more than the average user. Who's going
    to donate an OS X Mac to the great Mr. Yanega!? I'll donate the time to train
    him!"
