body: I&#39;m too ansty for snail mail and I know we&#39;re suppose to wait for the
  winners to receive their mail even though pre-lims are out but I guess I&#39;m wondering
  if someone here knows if the TDC50 letters have been sent.  &#40;without goin into
  detail here, someone can just drop a &#34;yeah they were sent&#34;&#41; Y&#39;no
  water-cooler talk without the water-cooler. <BR> <BR>you see while trying to be
  positive, I&#39;m thinking that perhaps my postman is being really mean. hahahah
