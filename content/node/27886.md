body: FontLab is giving me a name for Ux03D6 as "omega1", but this is a variant of
  pi, correct? So my question is how do i rename this? do i call it by its uni-name
  or call it pi.salt. Is one version better than another? this said, should i go back
  and change other characters that are called things like sigma1, phi1, &c.?

  body: "Yes, this is the scribal pi. 'omega1' is a misleading name that occurs in
    the Adobe Glyph List.\r\n\r\nWhether you call it /uni03D6/ or /pi.salt/ depends
    on whether you want Acrobat to map it back to the regular pi character or to U+03D6.
    Of course, you could include a redundant glyph in your font and use both names,
    which would be very Adobe-like."

    for your input. a follw-up question, does it matter if this alternate form maps
    back to pi? is this simply a stylistic alternate?"

    got named <em>omega1</em> at some point, is most likely because it resembles omega

  body: "<em>...does it matter if this alternate form maps back to pi? is this simply
    a stylistic alternate?</em>\r\n\r\nHistorically, yes, it is just a stylistic alternate,
    one of many. Some of the Greek stylistic alternates have been used in modern times
    as symbols in mathematics and the sciences, which is why some of them are separately
    encoded in Unicode. The scribal pi is one of these.\r\n\r\nI think in the majority
    of cases, unless specifically making a font for use in scientific documents, you
    would probably this glyph to map back to the regular pi, and not to U+03D6.\r\n\r\nConsider:
    a user creates a document in Greek and uses OpenType Layout features to access
    stylistic alternates including the scribal pi. Through some chain of circumstances,
    a PDF is created that contains only raw glyph IDs, no Unicode strings. Acrobat
    parses the glyph IDs to try to reconstruct the text for searching and copy/paste
    operations. If the scribal pi is mapped back to U+03D6, the text is no longer
    in Greek, and cannot be reliably searched.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you are creating
    a scientific document and are using the character U+03D6 in your text to signify
    something with a semantic difference to pi, then you have the opposite problem
    if the scribal pi gets mapped back to the regular pi by Acrobat.\r\n\r\nThis is
    why Adobe's glyph redundancy model isn't really crazy after all."

    Premier Pro and many other fonts, the inverse is also true: U+03D6 is drawn as
    omega with a swoosh to the left instead of the scribal pi-like form with horizontal
    bar because of the wrong postscript name and other misleading associations with
    omega. This omega with a swoosh might have even became a modern tradition in itself,
    even though it has no greek scribal roots. "

  body: One does see the 'swoosh' form for pi in some Greek handwriting, sometimes
    with a returning stroke, creating a loop across the top of the omega-like shape.
    This occurs in quickly written text, not a carefully written scribal book hand.
    I don't think it is an ideal form for a typeface.
