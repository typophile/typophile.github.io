  for the admittedly self-serving purpose of asking for advice :)\r\n\r\nI am not
  a designer. I'm an artist (mostly photography) & Tarot reader. I used to do letterpress
  artists books in the mid90s & so acquired just enough typographical knowledge to
  be dangerous. \r\n\r\nLong story short, I have been lusting after Electra for a
  long time & now have the funds to indulge such a purchase. But lo & behold, when
  I went searching for it, up popped Parkinson Electra too! I know what Electra looks
  like in the wild\u2014that's why I want it. But I'm not aware of having seen Parkinson
  Electra in action, & I don't have the typographic eye to tell from samples if I
  will like it better, the same, or worse.\r\n\r\nI want to use it in print collateral
  & on my website for my Tarot & dreamwork microbusiness. It will be paired with my
  handwritten pen & ink logo (see attached; I did it as an attachment because \"insert
  image\" kept giving me an error).\r\n\r\nSo, the questions:\r\n\r\n1. If you have
  used/seen Parkinson Electra, how does it compare to Electra?\r\n\r\n2. If you could
  only buy one, which would you pick, & why?\r\n\r\n3. The extra credit question:
  Is there a strong argument for my *not* using either of them for this purpose? (Other
  contenders: Adobe Garamond, Sabon, Scala, Minion, all of which I already have. Old
  style figures a must.)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for all advice, opinions, discussion...\r\n"

    but the main difference I know is that the old one has heavier caps to l.c. like
    older faces, while Jim's updated that I think...\r\n\r\nI think this is a great
    use. When I class types for the occult this is one of them."

  body: "very funny, dberlow :)\r\n\r\nI was kinda hoping to hear what overall impression
    the Parkinson gives on the page. When looking at a paragraph in Electra & a paragraph
    in Parkinson Electra, what changes? I can see & read about the details but, as
    I said, lack the eye to translate that information into \"what will it actually
    look like?\""

    only finding very limited one-line samples on other sites.\r\n\r\nI would still
    welcome any reports from folks who have used both & can speak to the differences
    in overall effect.\r\n\r\nAs for asking the cards: I wonder if anyone has ever
    thrown cards about font choices before?! The tarot is a tool of metaphor & archetype,
    & so is typography in many ways, so it may actually be worth a try :)"

    in the past & Archer in the future...\"\r\n\r\nBut what does it mean?!!\r\n\r\nOh,
    the mysteries!\r\n\r\nAnyway: the sample paragraphs on fonts.com are very instructive.
    I can see how the Parkinson addresses problems that folks have pointed out about
    the earlier digital Electra (I believe \"anemic\" has been a popular description)
    & if I were setting a book I might prefer it. For my purposes the spaciousness
    & lightness of Electra seem more appropriate.\r\n\r\nIn print, anyway. I'm not
    crazy about either one as a web font."

  body: "Yes, \u201Canemic\u201D would be one word to describe all the older digital
    versions of Electra, which all seem to have been made forgetting about the ink
    spread, which today is much less than it was back when Electra was originally
    designed. I love Electra, but Parkinson Electra is the only digital version I
    know of that would be usable for print as a text face. On the web I would use
    Electra cautiously only for large display type.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

  body: "Interesting thread. I can't tell the difference between the old Electra and
    Parkinson's version, but as alternative approach you could try to look for an
    historical link. For example: since the first documented, Modern appearance of
    Tarot seems to have been in  mid-15th century Europe, namely Northern Italy and
    France, an old-style (\"Venetian\") typeface would be appropriate. Think of Jenson
    or - why not - Arno. Sabon and Adobe Garamond would also work efficiently, though
    their original models came a bit later.\r\n\r\nAnother historical moment related
    to Tarot history is 18th century France, with the Tarot de Marseille. In this
    case, the digital Monotype Fournier - or its contemporary rendition, Corundum
    - could be a working font. I have used Fournier for a record cover related to
    Tarot, with good results I think.\r\n\r\nThe hand written logo is handsome, by
    the way."

    of Parkinson Electra? I can't help feeling like that f got the short end of the
    stick, so to speak. See, this is why it's good I'm here, to listen to professionals
    who can see the forest while I'm stuck on the trees :)\r\n\r\nAlso thanks for
    confirming my feeling about the web usage of these.\r\n\r\nbtw, I notice (& appreciate)
    your curly quotes\u2014even in a forum post! Now that is Hard. Core. \r\n\r\nncaleffi:
    Thank you! I really appreciate the Tarot-informed ideas. Will go have a look at
    all the faces you mentioned. \r\n\r\nI have been looking at a lot of Art Nouveau
    design while thinking about this, because the deck I use (the ever-popular Rider-Waite-Smith
    deck) is just over 100 years old & has strong Nouveau influences. At the same
    time I want an overall contemporary flavor\u2014hence no Mucha lettering; I think
    a lot of my collleagues get very stuck on \"ancient wisdom\" & so forth, so their
    branding looks like it belongs at the Renaissance Faire. Not a bad thing in &
    of itself, but it's just not me, & it's not my clients either. \r\n\r\n& I'm glad
    you like the logo!"
