  body: "Just  out of curiosity, may I ask you what the 2 words mean? I've been in
    Croatia many times and one of the words sounds familiar.\r\nI like it when the
    2 words join in more than one point (so the first is not my favourite) so that
    it looks like an image rather than 2 separate words (if it makes sense) but I
    leave it to the experts! oh, I also like the fact that it's not very conventional
    for a metal band. I think."

  body: "Hi Sandro. I guess this is much easier for native Croatian speakers to get
    their heads around. Please take what I say in the spirit of objective critique
    only:\r\n\r\nPersonally I have a problem with the loop of the 'g' doubling for
    the bowl of the 'e' on the lower line. In order to read the 'g' the 'e' has to
    become something else - so the arrangement compromises the readability of the
    second line anyway.\r\n\r\nWhy a lowercase 'd' to start the logo and an uppercase
    'S' halfway through it? Does Croatian capitalise proper nouns?\r\n\r\nWhy the
    extended stroke of the finishing 't'? It doesn't balance the 'S'. The negative
    shape below the second line is awkward (it would be anyway with this letter combination,
    but...)\r\n\r\nThe dotless 'i' and 'j' in the second line appear to be dotless
    only because their baseline is with the 'e' (not enough vertical space). And the
    'e' is only that high because you want it to be part of the 'g' above... this
    is maybe not a strong enough reason for compromising the 'i' and 'j' by removing
    their dots. \r\n\r\nAre they a 'classical' band? Why use a 'classical' type style?
    \r\n\r\nWhat aspect of the idea of 'another world' is being incorporated into
    the arrangement? Where is the design actually crossing boundaries?\r\n\r\nContrary
    to what Lore says above, I think it <em>should</em> look like a rock band, in
    a conventional sense. There are many other ways to start exploring this name visually,
    so I advise you to return to the drawing board."

  body: 'You are probably right Ben, I''ve seen so many cliches (blackletter, satanic
    stuff etc.) recently that I thought Sandro''s approach was refreshing. I didn''t
    feel that the references to the name <cite>another world</cite> were necessary
    but Sandro: if I was you, I would listen to Ben!'

  body: It's very pleasing aesthetically, and I agree with Lore, it's good that you're
    doing a metal logo that doesn't fall into the usual cliches, but I'm not sure
    that this is strong enough to attract attention on posters, CD covers, and t-shirts.
    If I was working on this I'd print it out on 11x17 in a couple colors, stick it
    up on a brick wall, and use that to decide if it's really strong enough to do
    the job.

    ( I like it aesthetically too :D :).\r\n\r\nLore thanks again for your comments
    ( I'll do some more work, thank for your kindly comments).\r\n\r\n\r\nThey wanted
    it something more classical and yes they are more rock then metal band (they have
    only one metal song).\r\n\r\nThey wanted old classical look.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do
    you have other type styles in mind </strong>, and I also think that there are
    more problems with e and g, but everyone were able to read that so dunno, maybe
    it is wrong by the rules but they read it succesfully :D.\r\n\r\nAnd I just want
    it for T to be <em>different</em> adding that \"upper\" extended stroke. I wanted
    capital S to balance with T. I failed...\r\n\r\nAnd at the end, I respect critiques
    so no problem Ben you helped me ( I had same thoughts, e and g and rest), btw
    any other another world ideas :D.\r\n\r\nI did something so check it out.(new
    logo applied on cd cover). Btw Ravens are element of logo:).\r\n\r\nAnd do you
    have any good suggestions for typewriter fonts styles?\r\nThanks everybody[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drugi-svijet-novi_5598.jpg]"

  body: You are stuck because you've started at the wrong end. Get off the computer
    and sketch on paper. Since drawings are more flexible, you'll find better ways
    of fitting the letters together. When you have a good composition, <em>then</em>
    try to manipulate the type to match it.

  body: "Sandro it's better than the first ones \u2013 I can actually read it, although
    that plant stem going into the second word compromises the 'i' and the 'j' of
    'Svijet', and because it's essentially an arbitrary element, why leave it (the
    plant stem) there?\r\n\r\nRavens huh? Are they ghost ravens? Is that why they're
    outlined in white?\r\n\r\nClich\xE9s exist for a reason... including the clich\xE9
    of so-called design educator suggesting that the essential communication issue
    in the composition is not being addressed, and that the design should be redrawn
    experimentally <em>by hand</em> starting with a choice of coherent ideas as a
    basis. (So I think Kevin's right about where you're starting from \u2013 but then
    I do this sort of thing in my day job)."

  body: "garden-\r\n\r\ni don't know how many variations you have tried, however,
    it looks like you've tried maybe 10 and are just stuck. don't get caught up in
    the typeface selection.\r\n\r\nlike everyone's said, try sketching a bunch of
    versions. sure, the computer is easier to manipulate but without a strong concept,
    your execution will fail.\r\n\r\nthere are lots of great typefaces out there.
    one of my new favorite foundries is www.typetrust.com you can find some great
    typefaces there that might fit what you are looking for. \r\n\r\ni would scratch
    your initial concepts due to the awkwardness and legibility issues. i am not opposed
    to the manipulation of the type, but if you're going to do it, have purpose behind
    it and make it appear logical, even though it's not. that's the beauty of ligatures.\r\n\r\nbest
    of luck."
