    so please do some checking before you recommend or use it. For example if you
    look at Pelletier's other fonts on Dafont** it's quite difficult to ignore the
    near-certainty of plagiarism...\r\n\r\n* Assuming it's not an outright clone.

    read over the comments on dafont and I\u2019m convinced that Claude Pelletier
    works from scans of old specimens. No outline theft. In the case of Chopin Script
    there\u2019s also a commercial version from URW called Polonaise which isn\u2019t
    exactly the same. Both seem to be based on specimens by Dan X Solo. I can\u2019t
    judge if the designs are copyright-protected or owned by anyone. In the case of
    Champion a copyright sure must have expired. In the case of Pistilli it says that
    Pelletier recreated Pistilli with John Pistilli's son\u2019s blessings.\r\nI <em>do</em>
    think this is all OK."

  body: "I think you're suffering from a convenient -and sadly also destructive- delusion.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    let me ask: do you think Ryuk bothered to do any such research before making the
    recommendation? Maybe you don't know, but it seems you also might not <em>want</em>
    to know... It's not about being <em>sure</em> something is OK or not, it's about
    being cautious, and conscientious. For example if you \"can\u2019t judge if the
    designs are copyright-protected or owned by anyone\", err on the side of caution.\r\n\r\nI
    feel you're being too careless and cavalier, with near-zero apparent regard for
    the people who actually make these things you enjoy using and IDing.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Jan, what about this now?\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99822\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (and I'm certainly not going to be a proxy human robot siccing font ID software

    and instincts to smell plagiarism, and the necessary dedication to and respect

    of us with font identification software who try to make life easier for others.
    Who give correct answers within minutes rather than in hours or days or not at
    all.  Who freely give benefit to others of their knowledge and expertise. I appreciate
    those answers are not limited by business connections to My Fonts, or Dafonts.\r\n\r\n\"I
