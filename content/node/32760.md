body: "I need help fixing a very screwed up Pages palette in Adobe Indesign CS2 on
  a Mac. The pages in the palette are off to one site, the scrollbar, new page, and
  trash icons are gone and neither restoring the workspace setting to default or rebooting
  are fixing the problem. I really don\u2019t have time to reinstall the software
  right now, and I don\u2019t feel like blasting all of my caches clean, so anybody
  have a suggestion.\r\n\r\nView this image to see what I'm talking about:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pages-borked_6670.jpg]"

  body: "Have you tried 'disconnecting' the palette from the 'dock-thingy'?\r\nBy
    grabbing the tab with 'pages' on it, and dragging it away from the dock-thingy.
    So that you have a stand-alone pages window."
