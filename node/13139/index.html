  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello there,
I just wanted to see what everyone thought of this logo for a local Commercial Printing company. That&rsquo;s all i can really say about them.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that the link below didn&rsquo;t work right. I reattached the reworked version of the logo based on everyone&rsquo;s comments.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i see a face in the two o&rsquo;s with the bent &lsquo;l&rsquo; in between. i understand the idea, i just feel the application is a little choppy and too broken up between the circles. it starts to feel very seperated and not as one whole idea.</p>
<p>the larger circle seems to be lighter weight than the smaller ones&hellip;this might be an illusion? maybe try filling the smallest circle as red and turning the &lsquo;l&rsquo; red as well? either that, or bring the small circle closer to the two large circles and even out the space between the two &lsquo;o&rsquo;s and the &lsquo;l&rsquo;?</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d also try losing the bend of the &lsquo;l&rsquo; at the top and giving it it&rsquo;s height back to match the &lsquo;h&rsquo; in graphics?</p>
<p>incorporated seems like an afterthought. might be too small. application wise, i think it is. if this is going on a business card small or some sort of letterhead, i think it will just end up as something unreadable.</p>
<p>is the little divet in the &lsquo;i&rsquo; something you did of is that how the typeface is?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can see what you&rsquo;re trying to convey&hellip; I echo Will&rsquo;s post, I think that the &lsquo;incorporated&rsquo; is too small and will get lost at small sizes.</p>
<p>I like your choice of typeface - clean edges and neat - the kind of attributes you expect from a print company!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced about the &lsquo;l&rsquo; being dropped down - I like the idea of the print rollers and paper, but I feel it&rsquo;s a bit forced; really you should be able to read the wording first and then the reference to the print rollers should hit you separately as you &lsquo;get it&rsquo;. For me it&rsquo;s not working properly either way, not as a word, or as a clever graphic of print rollers.</p>
<p>I think that part of  why it&rsquo;s not working properly is the small out-of-place &lsquo;o&rsquo; - I didn&rsquo;t read it as a part of the word - I saw it as a symbol, because it&rsquo;s so small in comparison with the rest of the glyphs. To be honest, I see it as either &lsquo;coloraphics&rsquo; or &lsquo;colgraphics&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d perservere with the idea, try wrapping the paper &lsquo;l&rsquo; a different way maybe. I&rsquo;d like to see it work, I think the concept behind it is great.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with both of you on the &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo; it was a bit of an afterthought. I hate that you have to put &ldquo;inc&rdquo; or &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo; due to &ldquo;piercing the corporate vail.&rdquo; Oh well, we&rsquo;re still pushing through that.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;i&rdquo; divid is on purpose. I agree on the &ldquo;h&rdquo; and &ldquo;l&rdquo; issue with the height. I didn&rsquo;t notice that to be honest. I was too concerned with maintaining the white space between the paper and rollers.</p>
<p>I think some of the readability issues you both mentioned may be due to the color treatment. What do you think?</p>
<p>To be honest everyone else this was shown to didn&rsquo;t have any problem seeing it as &ldquo;Colorgraphics.&rdquo; This was the first someone said it didn&rsquo;t look like it. Again, maybe color treatment?</p>
<p>The small &ldquo;o&rdquo; is actually was put there to further the formation of the &ldquo;g.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to work with the &ldquo;l&rdquo; a bit more and see what develops. I think that may be the basis for some of these issues. I&rsquo;ll also work on the color treatment. I&rsquo;m not satisfied with it to begin with.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your comments.</p>

I made some type and color treatment changes. I used some your suggestions and added some more of my own observations. Any new thoughts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with other commenters the logo looks a bit forced. I don&rsquo;t perceive it as a unity; I think a logo that makes you think it is constructed isn&rsquo;t finished yet.</p>
<p>Apart from that - the print roller idea isn&rsquo;t quite original. It is like the use of cmyk colors in logo&rsquo;s for printing companies; a bit overused. What would be important for this company&rsquo;s clients? I would guess that print rollers don&rsquo;t tell them anything about what makes this company stand out.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>
