body: "So I was bored on my train ride out of NYC the other day so I busted out my
  PowerBook and opened up Font Explorer. I proceeded to check out the character map
  for some of my typefaces and stumbled upon tons of extra glyphs (dingbats?) that
  I had not known about. This was kind of sparked by my current wallpaper created
  with Underware's Sauna and an included dingbat: http://veer.com/download/wallpaper/relax1440x900.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
  curious, because the only alternates I know are holding the option key to access
  other included glyphs/marks. Essentially is there a way to find out the key commands
  that trigger these glyphs? if that IS in fact how its done? Thanks!"

    new glyph palette and the superopentypeyummy typefaces make it all that much more
    fun. \r\n\r\nThis is random. But playing with the glyph palette gives me some
    sense of what it is like to set type by hand. \r\n\r\n"

    Nevermind...doubleclick...duh. But what about if I'm interested in using these
    glyphs in body copy...say in Quark. What then?"

    grass. You don't want to use Quark. No, you <em>really</em> don't. Trust me. :^D\r\n\r\nWe

  body: The problem with OpenType fonts whose character sets exceed the 256 positions  that
    were available with ASCII-encoding, is that there simply are not enough key combinations
    to access them all. So there is no "easy" way apart from selecting them through
    the aforementionned methods.

  body: "You can type a lot of accented characters which are not normally accessible
    in OS X. Just enable the U.S. Extended keyboard layout using the International
    control panel in System Preferences. Instead of bullets, math symbols and such,
    it turns most of the option-key combinations into \"dead\" accent keys so you
    can enter, for example, opt-m followed by e to get \u0119 (e with an ogonek).
    It helps to have the Keyboard Viewer open so you can see which keys to type to
    get different accents. (Note: It doesn't work for every possible accent/character
    combo--they have to be combinations that exist in Unicode. Also, not all (or even
    mosts) fonts have all those characters.)"

  body: "You can also use Unicode Hex Input. You just hold down the option key while
    typing the four Unicode hex digits. Here's the four playing card suits entered
    using this method: \u2663\u2666\u2665\u2660 \r\n\r\nWindows has something similar
    to this and it's the only way to enter some characters we take for granted being
    able to type on the Mac (like proper quote marks). The drawback is that you have
    to know or look up the codes.\r\n\r\nMore about all this stuff here:\r\n\r\n\_\_\_<a

  body: Actually, if you're using Font Explorer X, get "Information" on a font or
    family, then under "Characters" you can select a glyph and it will tell you the
    key code, if there is one. If not, you'll be stuck using the Glyphs palate.

    can use a font editor to create a copy of the font you need with the glyphs moved
    to keyboard-accessible positions.\r\n\r\nI've used TypeTool to make greek upper
    and lower case versions of fonts I use.\r\n\r\n(Perhaps I should add that I do
    not distribute the resultant fonts; printers get a PDF with subset embedding only.)"
