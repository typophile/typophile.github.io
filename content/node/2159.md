body: '{From Bauhaus to Your House} <BR> <BR>Has anyone read this book? What are your
  thoughts? <BR>Although I still think the world of the Bauhaus greats in general,
  the book offers a very convincing &#34;other side of the story&#34;. The book seems
  to kind of make the point that in trying to &#34;start from zero&#34; they ended
  up with zero.  <BR> <BR>Are there other books anyone knows of off-hand dealing with
  the negative aspects of bauhaus? <BR> <BR>'

    it to the Vienna Secession, how they both had their own singular building, which
    was the center for the &#34;compound&#34; out of which all the rules and ideas
    came from. <BR> <BR>His main critique is that it became so important and so highly
    regarded that an attempt at anything else was considered &#34;bourgeois&#34;,
    and almost even spiritually wrong. &#40;The book makes many religious references.&#41;
    Another main point is how clients didn&#39;t ever actually like the designs they
    were paying for, but kept paying for them anyways, allowing the designers/architects
    to dictate to them what was good and bad.  <BR> <BR>It deals mostly with architecture,
    rather than type or any other art, but certainly the applications can be made.
    It talks about how even Philip Johnson used to like to be called &#34;Mies van
    der Johnson&#34; and that even the architects who realized the flaw of everything
    looking &#34;bauhaus&#34; had to become part of the system in order to be taken
    seriously and still move away from it &#40;Robert Venturi.&#41; <BR> <BR>It has
    a really striking picure that I hadn&#39;t seen before of one section of Yale
    &#40;a museum I think&#41; which was done in gothic revival, next to an addition
    in bauhaus style, and it looks rather pathethic, even though it is &#34;simple&#34;
    and &#34;clean&#34; which is still how people like to describe &#34;good&#34;
    design, and think that if they say, &#34;this is good because it is simple&#34;
    that they are automatically justified. <BR>And here&#39;s a random thought; I
    really hope the new WTC design isn&#39;t just another &#34;glass box&#34; but
    is instead something really creative. If we keep rebuilding mimics of the past
    we aren&#39;t really making much progress. &#40;Maybe this relates to redoing
    old typefaces?&#41; <BR>Anyhow, good book. Would like to read others like it.

    typography that Bauhaus has offered that I can&#39;t live without.  The grand
    master of Bauhaus returned to traditional typography in his later days and denounced
    his previous works. I am not clear on whether that was ever published. I was privileged
    to a clear headed lengthy monologue by Hans Schmoller who worked for Penguin after
    Jan Tschichold. <BR> <BR>Hans was a pretty interesting typographer in his own

    <BR>So don&#39;t take any particular offence. I think Hitler was more than a despicable
    creature. Also, my views about genocide are well posted. The very reason I criticize
    Israel about their treatment of the Palestinians are for the very same reasons
    I am critical of the German treatment of the Jews in the period of the last world
    war. I am against racism, violent racism even more so. Do you have a  problem
    with that? I believe that Nazi&#39;s and the present Jewish politicians are anything
    but beyond criticism. Sorry for the reality, believe me. <BR> <BR>But it is impossible
    to live an entire life never doing anything right. So you must learn to give credit
    when earned. Even Hitler. <BR> <BR>But my comment has nothing to do with my opinions

    agree that this kind of &#39;automatic&#39; link &#39;simple=good&#39; is wrong.
    But this building designed by Kahn is certainly not &#39;pathetic&#39;. IIRC,
    it has some great &#40;complex&#41; ceiling devices for natural lighting &#40;it&#39;s
    a museum&#41; in the intern spaces. The building is only apparently simple. And
    Kahn is far from the Bauhaus style, he was <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Institute_of_Public_Admin.html">

    in architecture. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t recall reading this book
    by Wolfe. But anyway, I can&#39;t agree with this. The modern architecture &#40;including
    the Bauhaus&#41; represents a new way of understanding and organizing space. Which
    doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t have its &#40;big&#41; problems... And it was not
    easy for me to understand the great contributions of modern architecture &#40;I
    went to architecture school&#41;. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262680378/002-2743001-2411231?v=glance">
    This book</a>, a collection of articles written by Colin Rowe, helped me understanding
    many questions, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a bit too &#39;heavy&#39;/&#39;academic&#39;
    for non-starters. <BR> <BR>&#62; But in typography I think it has more of a mixed
    legacy - some good, some bad.  <BR> <BR>OK, I think I agree. <BR>In any case,
    let me clarify this: Bauhaus architecture was one thing, Bauhaus typography was
    another. The contributions of Bauhaus to architecture are mostly exclusively related
    to architeture. And, FWIW, I think Bauhaus was more important to architecture
    than to typography... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald: <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t tell people

    OK to me. <BR> <BR>&#62; Hitler was right, Bauhaus sucks.  <BR> <BR>Hmmm. <BR>Anyway,
    this is interesting... Just a thought... What would&#39;ve happened if Bauhaus
    continued to exist in Germany? I mean, because of the end of Bauhaus, those guys
    had to move to USA. And this was an important factor to the rising of the &#39;International
    Style&#39;, as we know it...'

  body: 'The biggest problem with &#39;Bauhaus&#39; typography &#40;and note that
    the biggest proponent of asymetric typography, Tschichold, was not involved with
    the Bauhaus&#41; is that it is very hard to do well. Tschichold could do it well,
    and could also do classical typography well, and his realisation was that in the
    latter it was easier for the average craftsman to achieve an attractive result.
    Only a handful of people produced really good modernist typography: more of it
    was sterile. I suspect that the same is true of architecture, although in that
    field one should take into account materials and building techniques as well as
    aesthetics when one talks about what constitutes modern.'

    when he did it.  <BR>  <BR>After looking through several sites, it seems to me
    that Kahn&#39;s work does highly resemble the Bauhaus, even though he had a lot
    of spoken ideas that were different. This is another point the book was making...tons
    of ideas were going around, but everything still looked the same. Kahn talks about
    how going back to the beginning is where all the excitement is. If this isn&#39;t
    Bauhaus... I mean, that&#39;s straight from the mouth of Gropius. &#40;O white

    to see.&#41; <BR> <BR>I like many of Kahn&#39;s aspirations, particularly regarding
    artificial &amp; natural light. But about other things I&#39;m not sure: &#34;Beauty
    was not within his immediate concerns.&#34; This is especially confusing when,
    for example, <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~freshness/essay1.html" target="_blank">here</a>
    it talks about Kahn saying how beautiful columns are, but his addition doesn&#39;t
    have any columns, does it? &#40;maybe it does on the inside?&#41; It&#39;s just
    a wall, with lines, that supposedly reveals the structure of the original. His
    connections between columns and bringing in light and dividing spaces is pretty
    brilliant though, and I see how the inside brings in light. But still confused
    on the outside. <BR> <BR>It seems that Kahn&#39;s addition could have better related
    to its context. The context is an entire campus built in gothic revival. How does
    the International style fit in here? I&#39;m not saying that it can&#39;t.. at
    this point I&#39;m still asking questions, because it&#39;s not immediately obvious.
    <BR> <BR>If he would have said that the building was about contrast, I might at
    least see where he was coming from. But he says his building &#34;revealed the
    structure&#34; of the gothic one next door... I need to see how. Is putting something
    plain &#40;possibly boring&#41; next to something exciting revealing the structure
    of anything? The book does mention that the interior made use of some clever innovations.
    <a href="http://www.yale.edu/yuag/" target="_blank">[pic of the lighting]</a>
    That&#39;s really nice! Except, still, I don&#39;t see how it relates to gothic
    architecture. Another museum he did used long vaults &#40;long hallways were an
    international style thing&#41; and I see how that relates, but that was in texas,

    that the Bauhaus people where so good at convincing people of their superior taste
    that they paid for buildings that very few people liked, and many detested. <BR>
    <BR>In the US, when the Bauhaus influence started waning - I guess by the end

    his works. Also, as you know, Tschichold and I had a mutual friend.</i> <BR> <BR>In
    what I&#39;ve read of Tschichold&#39;s own writing, he never rejects asymetric
    typography; rather, he rejects his early ideological insistence on asymetric typography,
    and acknowledges that both asymetric and classical typography have their place,
    with the latter being most appropriate for books. I think it is important to look
    at the kind of material Tschichold was designing at different points in his career,
    and that the move to classical typography coincides with a move from advertising
    and what we would now call &#39;identity&#39; design &#40;e.g. stationery&#41;
    to book design -- and book design of a specific kind: predominantly literary texts
    in octavo format. <BR> <BR>I have an interesting German book that combines Tschichold&#39;s
    writings -- illustrated with samples of his work -- from both halves of his career.
    Most English language publications, excepting Ruari Maclean&#39;s not very good
    biography, deal with either his asymetric typography <i>or</i> his classical book
    design, as determined by the interest/bias of the translator or publisher. The
    German book is better, I think, because it conveys the consistency of Tschichold&#39;s
    attention to detail and quality, and makes one realise how this, not apparently
    opposing styles, is really key to understanding what Tschichold was about. In
    his early career, he developed asymetric typography to a very high level, and
    wrote books urging other typographers to follow suit. In his later career, he
    applied exactly the same level of quality to classical typography, and wrote what
    amount to style guides that would enable other typographers to achieve pleasing
    results. This is why I think the relative ease of achieving such results in the
    classical style, compared the more difficult task of achieving beauty in asymetric
    typography, was an important factor in Tschichold&#39;s <i>volte face</i>, especially
    as it is expressed in pedagogical efforts such as the essays in <i>The form of
    the book.</i> The fact that he developed his classical book design techniques
    in the context of the Penguin publishing programme is also interesting, and suggests
    a context in which mass-production of attractive typography, achievable by designers
    and printers following style guides, would become preferable to more difficult
    works requiring individual genius of the kind Tschichold himself had demonstrated
    in his early career.'

  body: John, <BR> <BR>Although I misunderstood your original post I am thankful that
    I did. Your effort has not been wasted on me. <BR> <BR>I have been exposed to
    Tschichold from different directions. Not only Hans Schmoller but also Nick Schwabe.
    Nick was the master Swiss printer that gave me his book. The one we had talked
    about where the Church developed a peculiar habit  of beheading people like me.
    <BR> <BR>Nick belongs to the famous Schwabe printing family. He was a shareholder
    of the Schwabe publishing firm responsible for printing many books Tschichold
    designed, and some of which, he wrote. I would guess you will find Schwabe, the
    firm, indexed in books about Tschichold. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/PrivatePress.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/PrivatePress.html</a> <BR> <BR>Most
    remarkable is how different Tschichold is described by different tradesmen within
    the same industry. <BR> <BR>Hans Schmoller  of Penguin was an interesting designer
    himself but for that matter so was Nick Schwabe. Nick&#39;s work was decidedly
    <i>Swiss Style</i>. But once in a while Nick would express his classical typography.
    He was good. Also Nick was certainly the finest pressman I have ever had the pleasure
    to work with. <BR> <BR>I am telling you about Nick because I have no reason to
    believe he has passed away and probably still lives in British Columbia. <BR>
    <BR>But I have a little story about Swiss training. Nick taught me how to set
    type. Part of which is, sadly I report, distributing types correctly back into
    their case.  <BR> <BR>Certainly this is not the end of the story but it is as
    far as I dare tell. <BR> <BR>If you value your life you will <i>not ask Nick the
    end of my story of how hand setting types was taught in Switzerland.</i> <BR>
    <BR>Morality aside, it worked very well. I got pretty good at it.

    buildings, yes, but he was a great architect anyway. Some of his projects have
    amazing subtleties. I&#39;d blame Philip Johnson instead. <BR> <BR> <BR>John:
    <BR>&#62; it is very hard to do well. [...] <BR>&#62; I suspect that the same
    is true of architecture, [...] <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;re right. <BR> <BR> <BR>Brian:
    <BR>&#62; it seems to me that Kahn&#39;s work does highly  <BR>&#62; resemble
    the Bauhaus <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think Kahn&#39;s buildings look like Bauhaus.
    Kahn was more sensible and subtle than the Bauhausians. See the materials, for
    example. <BR> <BR>&#62; even though he had a lot of spoken ideas that  <BR>&#62;
    were different. This is another point the book  <BR>&#62; was making...tons of
    ideas were going around,  <BR>&#62; but everything still looked the same. <BR>
    <BR>Good point. I must say, the greatest architects were usually pretty bad at
    expressing themselves through words. :-&#40; <BR> <BR>&#62; It seems that Kahn&#39;s
    addition could have better  <BR>&#62; related to its context. The context is an
    entire <BR>&#62; campus built in gothic revival. How does the  <BR>&#62; International
    style fit in here? I&#39;m not saying  <BR>&#62; that it can&#39;t.. at this point
    I&#39;m still asking  <BR>&#62; questions, because it&#39;s not immediately obvious.
    <BR> <BR>Very good question. <BR> <BR>&#62; But he says his building &#34;revealed
    the structure&#34; <BR>&#62; of the gothic one next door... I need to see  <BR>&#62;
    how. Is putting something plain &#40;possibly  <BR>&#62; boring&#41; next to something
    exciting revealing the <BR>&#62; structure of anything? <BR> <BR>Those horizontal
    lines in the facade correspond to the floors of the old building &#40;which match
    the floors of his new building too&#41;. Kahn&#39;s addition also has the same
    height of the old building. Maybe these &#39;tricks&#39; don&#39;t &#39;reveal&#39;
    anything, but anyway, he was able to create some subtle visual links between the
    two parts. <BR> <BR> <BR>William: <BR>&#62; My experience is that their actual
    buildings,  <BR>&#62; though, are emotionally cold and inhospitable. <BR> <BR>I
    understand. And if you were talking about the post-Bauhaus &#39;International
    Style&#39;, I&#39;d have to agree with you. <BR> <BR>&#62; Tom Wolfe&#39;s book,
    which this thread started  <BR>&#62; with, argues that the Bauhaus people where
    so  <BR>&#62; good at convincing people of their superior  <BR>&#62; taste that
    they paid for buildings that very few <BR>&#62; people liked, and many detested.
    <BR> <BR>Ok, this might have been true, but after the end of Bauhaus, the &#39;glass-and-steel-box&#39;
    style became popular, the big companies wanted it. This is what we usually call
    &#39;International Style&#39; in architecture. This &#39;International Style&#39;
    borrowed the superficial look of the modern architecture, but the great spatial
    explorations of the modernism were left behind. <BR> <BR>I went to the library
    today and found Wolfe&#39;s book. I gave it a quick glance, and noticed he says
    good things about Johnson&#39;s project for AT&amp;T. To me, this building is
    &#39;International Style&#39; too. It&#39;s another &#39;cold glass-box&#39;,
    with a fancy thing at the top... <BR>'

    rendered more than useless, because he has to distribute his pie</i> [spilled
    type] <i>as well as recompose his matter; if he still remains contumacious, the
    whole of the types in his case are transposed, so that he cannot proceed in his

    lines I got off Amazon&#39;s website about it: &#34;The Prince&#39;s central point
    is that modern architecture has lost sight of its surroundings. Rather than creating
    structures that harmonize with their location, using local materials and respecting
    the history of the site, many modern buildings seem determined to draw attention
    to themselves -- or rather, to their architects. Like any art, architecture is
    a matter of taste. But while you can hide a bad statue or painting, an ugly building
    is a blot on the landscape that&#39;s darn hard to avoid.&#34; <BR> <BR>I read
    this book way back when it was published -- I think in the mid 1980s. It caused
