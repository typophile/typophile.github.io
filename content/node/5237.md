  body: i like the Top Go ligature better. maybe you could incorporate some of the
    hand-drawn serifs like on the top bar of the T, the descener of the y, the top
    of the G and the ascender of the d, and in the z. but maybe you&#39;re going for
    super streamlined, i dunno. i just think the serifs give it a bit more edge, but
    maybe this isn&#39;t a real edgy band. maybe you can give us more insight on what
    they&#39;re all about, what kinda feel they&#39;re going for.

  body: You know, I didn&#39;t interpret the subtle lines in the sketch as serifs
    until you pointed that out!  To me it looks like misaligned connections &#40;like
    when you&#39;re drawing and the lines don&#39;t quite meet up all the way&#41;,
    but I think you&#39;re right that it will look better to include some serifs.
    <BR> <BR>They do want an edgy look.  They are mainly a cover band, with a VERY
    strong emphasis on rock &#40;70&#39;s to current&#41;.

  body: I feel like the angles of each stroke need consistancy. However that could
    be a good thing or a bad thing. IMPO consistant letterforms and angles tends to
    make a logotype more concrete.

  body: 'I agree with Paul about the serifs - it gives the design more character.
    Also the original has more contrast between the thick and thin strokes &#40;ie:
    the underline and the top of the s&#41;. The newer versions lose that contrast
    and feel monotone. The connection between the G and o on the middle sketch causes
    me to read Too Many Grods. <BR> <BR>Personally, I&#39;m not getting an &#34;edgy&#34;
    feel from this. Don&#39;t interprut that to mean I don&#39;t like it, because
    I do. It&#39;s just it makes me think more of the chrome lettering off a 50&#39;s
    Ford Fairlane or someting rather than a rock-n-roll band. And it may just be a
    matter of semantics, but when I hear the word &#34;edgy&#34; in relation to music
    I think more of punk or grunge. From your loose description I sense they cover
    more of Led Zep and the like. Is that correct? Obviously since one of the band
    members drew the initial sketch it is something they like and you should continue
    on that path. However, just as an additional option, you may want to look at the
    logos of the bands they cover the most it may give you additional inspiration
    as to how to better relate the music they perform with their logo.'

    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/38477.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I
    wonder if my changes are too subtle? <BR> <BR>Kirsten, I am persuing other options
    as well as this one.  I agree that it might not be the best solution for their
    needs, but felt I should include a solid version of it since they obviously liked
    it.  I might post the other concepts I have as I continue to refine them. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks again for all the help!'

  body: <i>I wonder if my changes are too subtle? </i> <BR> <BR>i would say so, make
    those serifs a bit more pronounced. <BR>Looking at it again &#40;in light of Kirsten&#39;s
    comments&#41; I don&#39;t think the Go lig is a good choice, it cold be confusing.

  body: 'i like em larger. a few more suggestions: keep the &#34;serif&#34; on the
    G flat like on the T, the curve just doesn&#39;t do it for me. maybe angle the
    head serifs &#40;on n, y &amp; d&#41; downward a bit? maybe along the same angle
    as the &#34;serif&#34; on the y&#39;s descender. The G also looks like it could
    benefit from some modulation. i keep hopin you&#39;ll get some criticism from
    someone with more expertise than me! maybe they&#39;ll start bitin tonite...'

  body: can the baseline be a bit thinner and/or perhaps varied a bit? Also, it could
    just be an optical illusion, but the o&#39;s don&#39;t seem as italicized as the
    rest.

  body: I see a great opportunity to implement some metaphors and symbology here.As
    is, all I see is a type, that is could for a hard rock band or a drag racing team.
    Does not say anything to me about what TMG is or does. <BR>Since the name has
    obvious religious connotations, how about the &#34;T&#34; shaped being like a
    cross. maybe astaggered formation of 3 lines with type/elements interacting. Or
    perhaps sacred geometry. If this is not your flavor going grunge may be a way
    to go. Although grunge is dead there may be a use for it once in a while. If this
    band is punk or very hard rock consider attached image as a starting point. <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/38583.jpg" alt="tmg"> <BR>btw.
    formating the size for inten ded usage should be an important consideration. A
    logo like you had could look great on a wide banner but would lack visibility
    on standard sized printed materials &#40;4x6, postcard, 2x3.5 business card, posters,etc.

  body: Brandee, this is a lot of fun. Kinda retro <a href="http://www.fender.com/products/show.php?partno=0100800"
    target="_blank">Fender</a> Have you looked at other type similar to this? Or lettering?
    Leslie Cabarga&#39;s <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10875147505189476&amp;fontname=Magneto"
    target="_blank">Magneto</a> could be good reference. Your shapes are really coming
    together, I&#39;m not suggesting you mimic, but notice how he varies the connnections.
    It also seems like some of your angles are off. Maybe you need to choose one angle
    and have all letters follow that?
