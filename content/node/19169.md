      said this for me? I agree with you 100%, I'm just being inquisite (you've gotta
      learn somehow). There are the obvious reasons: Garamond is everywhere, and it
      wasn't designed to be carved. Beyond that, I'd like to hear what you have to
      say. Hopefully you can have a bit of pity on me, I've probably done a whole
      5\u201310 hours of lettering in stone, and don't know that much about it. "

    like a full 5-10 hours more than me.  :-)\r\n\r\nDunno, to me Garamond is way
    too self-conscious to mark -somebody\r\nelse's- death, plus the stroke contrast
    causes things to really be way\r\ntoo busy (probably because the third dimension
    is its own busy-ness).\r\nAnd can you imagine that \"g\" in stone?! Puke. The

      Thankfully, they'll be using all caps, so no attempts at the Garamond miniscule
      g.\r\n\r\nIf the image you posted is \"Oh, I'm so dead, look at me, look at
      me!\" then Garamond would be \"Hi I'm dead, what's your name?\" Maybe we should
      make a new thread about what fonts would say if set on a gravestone, or is that
      a bit macabre?"

  body: "<em>cemetery messed up and forgot to mention they only use granite and have
    crappy people who make terrible design decisions for stones</em>\r\n\r\nThis sounds
    typical. Most granite is machine cut, and the lettering looks just awful. Very
    few people can cut granite by hand, because it is so hard. The large grey slabs
    on the back of the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London are some of
    the only pieces of hand carving in granite I have seen. Michael Harvey designed
    them, but he hired a much younger and stronger person to cut them. This stonecutter
    worked one day on and one day off, because by the end of a day of cutting the
    granite he could barely hold the chisel. It is brutal on the muscles in the hand
    and wrist.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Michael Harvey, his Moonglow typeface (available
    from Adobe) would be a good, distinctive choice. I first saw these letterforms
    cut in raise relief on stone by Michael during the 1997 ATypI conference in Reading.
    The outline style works well very large. There are also a good range of weights
    and widths in this family, so getting the right balance for the stone will be
    easier. In the mockup below I've used the semibold extended.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/STERNjh.gif]\r\n_\r\n\r\nThis
    is a difficult decision to make for a close family member. I hope some of these
    comments are helpful."

    I feel the T and the R are more relaxed then corporate and all the serifs are
    smooth rather then sharp which gives the font a calmer quality rather then a 'look
    at me' one."

    similar to a Garamond, but has much more (subtle) calligraphic character.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    the Monotype digital version is crap (sorry, I'm kinda tired of being nice about
    this, especially as the Monotype folks have not yet answered my latest email to
    them), so if you do decide on Centaur, ask me and I'll give you a copy of my version-in-progress.
    I'll probably need to draw some more glyphs (esp. for the numbers), but this would
    give me the motivation to dive back in."

  body: Centaur would be a good choice - the serifs have the stone carved look already.
    Eric Gill was a stone carver of note, and Perpetua (already mentioned) and Golden
    Cockerel show that influence in the cut of the serifs. Sort of traditional in
    a good way. This is, after all, carved in stone.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stern.gif]

    I would not choose from my fonts, or indeed from any fonts the the carvers are

    I had John Downer paint my house number sign using Iowan Oldstyle numerals (a
    slightly modified weight, between the regular and bold). David's comment about
    finding carvers who are typographically inclined is important. Also, have you
    confirmed whether the granite will be handcut or machinecut? In either case, you
    should ask to see samples, and look to see what kind of details are well handled
    and which are problematic."

    skills, work with him and ask his advice.\r\n\r\nTo me, the busier the font, the
    less likely it is to work carved. I would stick with short serifs.  The shadows
    and highlights of the v cut will give the feeling that the serifs are bigger than
    they are. The rest is all about the person you are remembering. What feels right
    for their personality? Would a more relaxed straight make sense or a more formal
    rigid line?\r\nI guess that wasn't much help since I did not give you a specific
