  hard to read annual reports, created, not to assist in conveying the message, but
  as monuments to the designers ego. There, I've said it.  Somebody had to. I just
  hope you folks who do the work are not personnaly offended because I need your help.
  \ \r\n\r\nI need a way to grade the legibility of the reports I get so that I can
  give reasonable, understanable, non-offending suggestions for improvement.   Talk
  about fonts, serifs, kerning, \r\nleading, and contrast, all comon terms in theoretical
  discussion, don't hold a candle to eyeball comparison of real copy to a recognized
  stanard of a known grade.  \r\n\r\nI need a book of examples of copy that have been
  graded by thousands of people who put them in order of legibility by saying, e.g.,
  this is better than that, I would need a glass for this, etc. With proper analysis,
  the pages could be marked as to the percent of that population that would have trouble
  reading the copy presented for grading.\r\n\r\n>>>>>> Does anything like this exist?
  \ Are there grading or testing services that I could suggest?    \r\n\r\nBTW, I
  have muy screen set to the smallest type size, but only part of the Typophile screen
  is displayed. I have to cut my line lengths short to keep my copy on the screen.
  \ Must it be this way? Am I missing something? \r\n\r\nI will be away June 23 to
  July 7.    ===gm==="
