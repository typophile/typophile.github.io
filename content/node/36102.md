  2004\r\n\r\nFF Nexus is built on Martin Majoor's \"three typefaces, one form\" principle.
  Three families \u2014 a serif, slab serif, and sans \u2014 are derived from a single
  design concept. The monospaced FF Nexus Typewriter plays well with the others, too.
  This breadth of options, combined with OpenType features (such as built-in small
  caps, alternate glyphs, and optional swashes) make FF Nexus an extremely versatile
  type system. \r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF+Nexus\">FF
