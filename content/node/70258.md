body: "Hi again, I'm working on an experience company for my final major prject in
  my current college course, the company offers a wide range of crazy experiences
  ranging from helicopter flights to bungee jumping, you get the idea.\r\n\r\nAfter
  alot of tweaking and playing around with the letters and overal logo I have come
  up with this design. I know you will probaly say the figures on the letters are
  too small, where I kind of agree I also think you can make out what they are doing.
  The colour choice of green is to show the idea of being outdoors and free, I originally
  used blue but it gave the impression that the company just offeres water or cold
  base activities.\r\n\r\nAny comments, critisms would be greatly appriciated :)  \r\n\r\n"

  body: The elements are far too small. If this logo was reduced to 50% of its current
    size (which still isn't that small) everything would get completely lost.

  body: I understand that, thing is I don't need it any smaller for any of my promotional
    material for the company. Yes If I were to continue this to a realistic company
    I would need to reconsider the elements and how to use them.

    a bad feel to the logo and I like what you're going for, but yes, the elements
    in the letters are too small"

  body: "The playful illustration \u2013 arguably the strongest part of this logo\_\u2013
    is being dominated by a boring \"all\" sitting on its head. A plain looking \"all\"
    doesn't deserve to sit on \"out's\" head...yet. You could really push this further.\r\n\r\nTry
    illustrating different people doing activities inside the word \"all\" as well.
    Then try it all on one line and see what happens."
