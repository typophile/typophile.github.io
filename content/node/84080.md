  body: I assume as most of fashion brands they're using a proprietary typeface. It
    shares some similarities with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/extended/|Akzidenz
    Grotesk Extended]]. Some letters remain off, mainly /C (very "avant-garde"), /S
    and /G. Some little edits on /E and this would quite good for the woodmark "RODEBJER".

  body: For a moment I thought it might be <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness/">Vonness</a>
    because of the angled terminals. But I don't think it is a match.
