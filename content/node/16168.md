    be identified by the roof on the capital I, as well as the curves of the two \"bowls\"
    of the capital B extending beyond its back. "

    looks very good. I'm liking these futuristic (but not overly so) sans faces. \r\n\r\nMark:
    Thank you, that's right. \r\n\r\nThanks for the help, everyone!"

  body: It's funny that these are thought of as futuristic. Bank Gothic is from around
    1930. Orator was designed for typewriters. I think the reason they work is that
    they look cold and mechanical. Cold and mechanical is how a lot of people think
    of the future.

    to me anything from the recent past that lasts until today is\r\npretty impressive...
    especially if it has to do with futurism!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Bank Gothic was (apparently) designed for use on business cards, forms, etc.
    An alternative to Copperplate Gothic. Tiny type, mostly. Not really meant to be
    a display face. Personally, I have always liked it, but it's a bit overused.
