    like how some of the serifs disappear in the bold face to avoid collisions."

    ogonek to the outer part of the base serif are <em>very</em> incorrect!"]] :-/

  body: "Huh, I thought I remembered Adam liking Ernestine's (but I could be wrong).
    In a way the outside serif is sort of being replaced by the beginning of the ogonek,
    so maybe that's why it's OK? Plus I think in a design with hefty serifs completely
    dumping the left half (like in some of those \"approved\" examples) would be a
    bit much.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a base constructed like the base of a,d,u.

  body: Maybe a little... The idea is sound; I think all it needs is to shorten the
    inside top right serif. But making it match the bold would be a safe change if
    you want to do that.
