body: Please can we not have another war on this thread either :D What do you use
  and how effective is it? i personally feel that a Mac gives me more speed and freedom
  to work effectively, being wireless too, I can connnect to the Internet at my local
  university too anywhere and everywhere. Do you think PC gives enough speed and storage.
  Prove me wrong if you have to! :D Tell me more, tell me more... :D

    Michelangelo used.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I use a PC. I could probably switch to a
    Mac with no great loss of productivity. It's not the computer, it's what you do
    with it. Many bad designers use Macs. Many good designers use Macs. Many bad designers
    use PCs. Many good designers use PCs. Obviously the brand of computer being used
    has no bearing on quality of design.\r\n\r\nWireless access, speed, and storage
    capabilities are not specific to any brand of computer. A Mac could have a smaller
    hard drive than a PC, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nI don't see why this debate keeps
    coming up over and over again. If you work better on a Mac, then use one. If you
    work better on a PC, then use one.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: It is cheaper. :-) Would be my guess, because that would be MY only reason
    for using a PC instead of a Mac. I surely can't see any other reason for doing
    it. I have done things with Windows and Linux, but it's either more work, or more
    annoying, or both.

    the pros and cons.\"\r\n\r\nWell, it depends on what you're going to do with it.
    \r\n\r\nIf you're comparing hardware, then you need to realize that it's not a
    PC vs. Mac issue. It's an Apple vs. Dell vs. HP. vs. Sony vs. Lenovo vs. Gateway
    vs. etc vs. etc vs. etc\r\n\r\nAnd then you have to compare the multitude of models
    available by each company.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the operating system, Windows and
    OSX and Linux are about 90% the same. They all do the basic same things, albeit
    in slightly different ways.\r\n\r\nIn terms of software availability, again, 90%
    of the tools an average graphic designer would use are available on either Windows
    or OSX platforms (or there's an equivalent for either one). \r\n\r\nIn the end,
    if you are truly looking for a comparison, then you need to tell us your requirements
    for a machine. Based on that, then we can give you specific pros and cons."

  body: "Dearest Miss Giggles\r\n\r\nI'd suspect agencies use PC over Mac mainly because
    the hardware is cheaper, the software is better understood by the techs, etc.
    Mainly economics.\r\n\r\nApple does not hold anywhere near the market share that
    the PC/Microsoft does, and in the late 90s was almost a goner.\r\n\r\nI've been
    working with computers since 1970. I was using mini-computers and the internet
    in 1975. In 1985 I was setting type on proprietary systems. In 1990 I was introduced
    to the Mac. While I have used PCs and my wife has one and swears by them, no way
    in hell I would use anything other than an Apple product. \r\n\r\nThey aren't
    necessarily expensive. I just buy used machines and gut them out. New processor,
    max memory, hard drive controller, video card, media ports; whatever it takes
    to get it to where it needs to be to function on a par with the newer than the
    newest. Cheaper and far more efficient than buying a junk new PC. The Mac OS is
    friggin unbelievably rock solid.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    with the 95% market share or the one with the 5% market share) people will remain
    distracted from the real issue, the fact that there are only two choices. \r\n\r\nAt
    least there are choices other than Ford and Chevy, or Coke and Pepsi - can't think
    of anywhere else (except government) where there are only two serious options.
    But it could be worse, take creativity software, is there any serious competition
