body: 'We&#39;re working on creating a not-for-all-that-much-profit publication on
  design and typography called FORM_SUBSTANCE &#40;which also happens to be the name
  of our font foundry and design agency&#41;. It will likely be a tabloid-sized newsprint
  publication, 2-color, and we&#39;re shooting for a 3-5,000 copy circulation for
  starters. Born out of a love of equal parts typography, graphic design and publication
  design, our influences &#40;visually and thematically&#41; will include EMIGRE,
  PLAZM, RAYGUN, SPEAK, EYE, TRACE &#40;AIGA&#41;... Content will range from the practical
  and/or theoretical to the conceptual and/or abstract, a mixture of Photoshop collage,
  &#34;typographics,&#34; vectors and clean editorial with generous white space. Design
  for design&#39;s sake, design for designers who love design and see it as art, but
  still for designers who are also practicing professionals. We&#39;re hoping a good
  chunk of our advertisers will be type foundries, as I think we&#39;re all sick of
  fuzzy web gif samples.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re interested in helping, contributing,
  advertising, being profiled/featured in the first issue, want to know more, want
  to tell us it won&#39;t work, want to tell us we&#39;re crazy for trying, please
  email us here: <A HREF="mailto:info@formsubstance.com">info@formsubstance.com</A>'
