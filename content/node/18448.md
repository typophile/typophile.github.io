  some of you may have seen before, but some / most, like me, may not, is '<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1129&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000173\"
  target=\"_blank\">Whomp</a>', by [[Alejandro Paul]] / <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com\"
  target=\"_blank\">SudTipos</a>, based on the lettering of Alf Becker. Released by
  Veer, this sure has instantly become my brandnew favourite 'fat script'. Lovely
  Lettering. Whomp, There it is.\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1129&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000173\"

  If anyone would like to buy me a license of 'Whomp', as a present / a gift, I sure
  as hell would accept and appreciate it. :)</em>"
