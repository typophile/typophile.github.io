body: I'm sorry this has to be my first post here, but it is literally taking a full
  1-2 minutes to load the next page every time I click on anything on this site.  I
  haven't seen a basic page load this slow since 1995.  I have other tabs open and
  other sites are working just fine, so it isn't my computer or modem speed.

  body: "Hi jedbadda,\r\n\r\nYep, you're correct, it really is that sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\r\n\r\nWelcome
    to hell!\r\n\r\nSeem that this is just the way it is, and nobody (in control)
    seems to know or care - believe me, I've emailed tech support and never had a
    single response. \r\n\r\nAsleep at the wheel!\r\n\r\nLots of frustration - not
    a pleasurable experience.\r\n\r\nEnjoy (reading all the double posts)!\r\n\r\nDoghouse
    Studio"
