body: "bike brand logo\r\n\r\nHi everybody, \r\n\r\nI'm working on a logo for the
  future brand called \"Franch Vintage Bike\"\r\nI want something simple and timeless,
  so I have chosen a shape of coat of arms (For the vintage style) and a sans serif
  font (for the contemporary style).\r\nI want some advice to find a detail who will
  give an identity more sp\xE9cific to my logo.\r\nIt could be a special characteristic
  on the type (or an other type for \"Vintage), it could be an additionnal element
  for the French touch (symbol).\r\nI have made several trials but I always return
  to my first draft...\r\nI'm open for all your propositions and advices.\r\n\r\nPs
  : Sorry for my english.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture d\u2019\xE9cran

  body: "The type needs more presence. I'm not sure why \"vintage\" is heavier in
    the top example - it makes it seem that's the name of the brand. Also, if you're
    shooting for class I'd make the shield taller - not so square. On the other hand
    the short shape does look more contemporary. But I don't think that sans is very
    contemporary - it looks like something that could have been made any time in the
    last 100 years...\r\n\r\nYou might want to use \"bicycle\" instead of \"bike\"
    (which I think is too casual). Or for that French touch you want what about \"bicyclette\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Hrant.\r\n\r\nAgree with you, It's not my brand so I can't change
    the name all the more that URL are saved\u2026\r\n\r\nI want to conserve the shape.
    \r\n\r\nSome other ideas? in particular for the font..\r\n"

    or some other outlet <em>not</em> related to the bikes.

  body: "\r\nI'm not in love with it. I like the design out-right but I don't feel
    like it's representing the french style ... specifically vintage french bicycles
    (for which I am a huge fan)\r\n\r\nI would research Rene Herse, Alex Singer, Peugeot,
    Motobecane and other famous bike brands both bespoke and mass production. I think
    you'll find some remarkable imagery to consider. \r\n\r\nMany french bikes had
    steel tubing decals such as Vitus or Reynolds steel tubes. Those decals have a
    unique enclosure shape that might also tie this more closely to the subject. Google:
    \"Vintage French Headbadge\"\r\n\r\nMaybe make the word \"Vintage\" a larger script
    of some kind. I like that you're thinking about an enclosure. Very appropriate.\r\n\r\nS."
