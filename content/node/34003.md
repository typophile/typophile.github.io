  anyone know if such a thing exists?\r\n\r\nI see <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=433445\">\"Ehrhardt
  MT Pro\"</a> on the Monotype site, but it looks like only the Regular weight has
  text figures. I see a few <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=243216\">Expert
  weights (Type 1)</a>, but I'm trying hard to buy only OpenType now.\r\n\r\nCould
  anyone that has the Pro version check to see whether the Italic weight has text
  figures? I've emailed Monotype but no response yet.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    to have text figures as well. Just click on the OT packages and you''ll see. '

    lining figures with a statement that says \"This is an OpenType Pro font, offering
    extended character and language support beyond what is shown above.\" \r\n\r\nThis
    is one reason I don't like to use fonts.com. "

    body: "Thanks for your replies! Dan, that's great news. I wish the website would
      better reflect that. (I much prefer the Linotype or Veer sites for type browsing.)\r\n\r\nI
      gave up on the email and called \"fonts.com\" today; they double-checked and
      the italic does indeed come with text figures.\r\n\r\nAnyone know why only Monotype
      carries the Pro version? ;-)\r\n\r\nTyler"
