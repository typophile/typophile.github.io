    one you want is 02C6, MODIFIER LETTER CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT\r\n\r\nEnter it the way
    you'd enter any Unicode character. There is a difference between the *characters*
    in spacing modifiers and combining diacriticals, even though they are often the
    same *glyph* -- a concept sort of at the core of Unicode."

    is an <strong>inverted breve</strong> as a modifier and not a combining diacritic,

    know what is the width of the horizontal space between two words, such as in this
    line, for example.

  body: "In Word or InDesign just copy and paste the unicode character using a font
    which supports it: \u0311.\r\n\r\nIn LaTeX there are multiple ways to achieve
    this:\r\n<ul><li> LaTeX has a series of built-in diacritical commands. Leaving
    the argument empty produces the diacritical mark. For instance, <code>\\^{}</code>
    renders as \u02C6. Here is a [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters#Escaped_codes|list
    of such commands]].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you use a XeTeX (putting <code>\\usepackage{fontspec}</code>
    in your preamble):\r\n<ul><li>Type the character directly.</li>\r\n<li>Type the
    unicode (hexadecimal) codepoint into the <code>symbol</code> command, with a preceding
    double apostrophe <code>''</code>. To produce an inverted breve you would type
    <code>\\symbol{''0311}</code>.</li>\r\n</ul>"

  body: "Yes, I don't know if there is an inverted breve (might also be called \"roundcap\")
    in Unicode that isn't ALSO a combining diacritic. \r\n\r\nAs has been suggested,
    easy enough to get one to print -- just use the combining diacritic over, say,
    a thin space between word spaces, but odd things happen to space characters in
    some applications, such as EPUB.\r\n\r\nIf the mark can be longer, as with a scansion
    mark, you could use one of those over a word space.\r\n\r\nNot sure why you need
    it, but things can be found in odd places in Unicode -- like the glottal stops
    for Guatemalan Mayan in a section generally devoted to Chinese...\r\n\r\nIt could
    be that if you described the need, one of the people more familiar with the Cyrillic
    alphabets could help. I forget which, but either Brill or Gentium is pretty good
    with extended Cyrillic characters.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, while most of us are never
    in favor of using Unicode characters for a purpose outside their intent -- like
    a combining diacritic for a spacing modifier --  in this case, you have have no
    choice."

  body: "In LaTeX, you can use phantom letters: they are not in the text but the text
    is typeset as if they were there. You can thus put you combining diacritic on
    a fictitious letter.

    here is the output:\r\n<img src=\"/files/ndiacr_3506.png\">\r\nThe <code>\\setlength</code>
    command doubles the interword spacing, so as to look more like your picture; a
    phantom \"a\" is used for the combining diacritic and the command <code>\\,</code>
    puts a thin space after because otherwise, it looked ill centered."

    It's not named \squash (and it's been over 10 years), but we use to use something
    like that to hide vertical height.
