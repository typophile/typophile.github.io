  it up accurately. So I gave up\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm looking for links to research, articles
  or forum discussions on the importance of typeface choice and typography in corporate
  identity design and branding, in particular focusing on the client or end consumer's
  perception of it.\r\n\r\ne.g. How a client or end consumer perceives a logotype
  set in Arial Bold at 75% width, paired with a tagline set in very loosely-tracked
  Mistral, as opposed to how a (talented or successful) designer who would be able
  to tell you without hesitation that it's a Quasimodo-esque monstrosity. I'm also
  hoping to find out how the client/consumer tells the difference (if at all) between
  a block of text set poorly in Arial from, say, one expertly crafted using Whitney.
  I hope that makes sense, I'm not so sure now as it's late and I'm tired.\r\n\r\nAny
  help/links/info appreciated. Thanks!"
