body: "Today, the co-founder of ParaType, prolific type designer and teacher <strong>Vladimir
  Yefimov</strong> has died in Moscow. \r\n\r\nBoth his original typefaces and his
  masterful Cyrillic extensions of existing Latin faces were truly impressive. He
  even attempted multi-script extensions such as that of <a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WvheupD2B8c/Tfm4pEUhMnI/AAAAAAAAADM/SP9JVG-tKFs/s500/Picture-2-2.jpg\">ITC
  Avant Garde</a>. \r\n\r\nAmong my favorite text faces (or actually, serif screen
  faces) is Vladimir\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/octava/\">Octava</a>.
  Matthew Carter praised Vladimir\u2019s Cyrillic version of <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pt/pdfs/fonts/ITC_Charter.pdf\">ITC
  Charter</a>, which I think is one of the finest Cyrillic alphabets ever designed.
  I was also very fond of Vladimir\u2019s Cyrillic extension of <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pt/pdfs/fonts/Kis.pdf\">Kis</a>,
  which John Hudson described as \u201Cone of his favourite Cyrillic text types as
  well as a remarkable exercise in historic imagination\u201D. \r\n\r\nVladimir often
  collaborated with other designers, many of them were his former students. One of
  the last projects that he participated in was the monumental <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/public/\">PT
  Sans and PT Serif</a> project. \r\n\r\nBut he was not only dedicated, skillful and
  artistically refined \u2014 but also kind, generous, modest, warm and funny. I first
  met him in 1998 at the ATypI Lyon conference, and greatly enjoyed all the subsequent
  occasions that I could spend some time with him. \r\n\r\nIt's been a great pleasure
  and a true privilege knowing him (a bit). \r\n\r\nGoodbye, \u0412\u043E\u043B\u043E\u0434\u044F.
  \r\n\r\nHis biography at <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/help/designers/designer.asp?code=PT_EV\">ParaType</a>
  and on his own <a href=\"https://profiles.google.com/VladimirJeffYefimov/about\">Google+</a>
  account (now sadly orphaned). And some of his typefaces at <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-eO8arV\">MyFonts</a>.
