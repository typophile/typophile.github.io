  with check marks symbols.\r\nI found check marks symbols in Zapf, Commercial 1 and
  Altemus Dingbats, but they are all way to thick to look good next to the text, even
  if I set the symbol 2pt smaller than the text.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know a font that
  has a relatively thin check mark symbol?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nV\xE9ronique"

  body: Oddly, you might look at some of the Pi fonts if you have Quickbooks or other
    installed. There's usually a lighter check mark.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/checkplease_4797.gif]
