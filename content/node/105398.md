    are interesting details in the font info for each of the fonts. I summarize them
    after each font name.  First the copyright holder. Then the version info. finally

    Dan X. Solo. 1998 [Macromedia Fontographer 4.1.5 9/4/98]. The glyph data in Steffman's
    2001 Titania match the Solo Titania.\r\n\r\nDon"
