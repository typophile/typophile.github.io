  that will allow me to set text in a preview on my site like villages mudTyper or
  Veer's [[http://www.veer.com/flont/|flont]]? I don't need anything too fancy.. just
  a basic preview mechanism.

    convenient: you don\u2019t have to specify a size, as your custom sample text
    is automatically scaled to fit the available space."

  body: "Scott,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m the creator of TypeShow. Please contact me directly
    (there is a tiny contact link in the site footer at [[http://www.typeshow.net]]).
    \r\n\r\nTypeShow is still a little rough around the edges and not quite ready
    for release, but it works as advertised \u2013 check it out on these websites:\r\n[[http://www.janfromm.de/typeshow/]]\r\n[[http://www.lucasfonts.com/typeshow/]]\r\n[[http://dehac.de/]]\r\n\r\nBen,
    you\u2019re right \u2013 LetterSetter is a great product with great rendering
    quality, it supports OpenType features and has been tested for years.\r\n\r\nThe
    basic difference is: LetterSetter is a service, TypeShow is a software package
    to install on your own server. Both ways have pros and cons.\r\n\r\nOne thing
    that is an important fact to me as an interaction designer:\r\nRight now, LetterSetter
    explicitly comes without an interface, where TypeShow brings a user-friendly,
    very responsive interface that I have spent a lot of time on, optimizing and tweaking
    the user experience. TypeShow\u2019s front-end runs on all browsers, even Internet
    Explorer 6.\r\nTypeShow is extremely fast, which is also important for the user\u2019s
    interaction with your site."
