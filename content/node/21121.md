  back of their uniforms? It's all lowercase and stunning.  Is it custom/what is it/who
  designed it? I love it! I have yet to get a sample. but will try to photograph the
  TV for some captures during the final on Sunday.\r\n\r\nITALIA!!!"

    I think today the best typography won.

  body: "Interesting to me is that so many contrries have the same jersey design.
    Adidas seems to have mandated how its country teams' jerseys will look. This is
    why Germany, France, Argentina, etc. all had the same (ugly) type and numbers\u2014this
    ITC Bauhaus monstrosity. Italy, Switzerland, and at least one other country were
    sponsored by Puma, who got their type from Dalton Maag.\r\n\r\nUmbro and Nike
    seem to have taken a different approach. Their jerseys all have <strong>different</strong>
    lettering, some of which, like that for England, was even designed by \"local\"
    typographers (i.e., The FA uses a custom typeface by Jeremy Tankard).\r\n\r\nSo,
    we can't really say that the best typography won yesterday: Italy may have had
    better lettering on their jerseys, but those letters weren't really Italian. Tonight,
    Nike's Portugal jerseys go up against Adidas' French ones (which look quite similar
    to the German jerseys from last night\u2026). Will the final be Puma\u2013Nike
    or Puma\u2013Adidas? I love the new Puma lettering (and the ingenious lowercase!),
    but I'd like to see Adidas\u2026 errrr, France, take it all on Sunday anyway."

    being a relative concept. The Puma type looks like a poor man's version of Max
    Kisman's early work. I'm so not impressed.\r\n\r\nThe Dalton Maag typefaces usually
    are pretty OK, but altogether not very exciting nor particularly inventive."

  body: "Well, another german link here, sorry. But quite interesting in this case
    I think. \r\nJ\xFCrgen Siebert from fontshop.de was contacted by Bruno Maag from
    DaltonMaag because of his weblog-entry regarding jersey-typography. And J\xFCrgen
    posted the comments of Bruno Maag in his weblog <a href=\"http://www.fontblog.de/files/bruno_maag-spricht.html#unique-entry-id-315\">Fontblog</a>.
    \ Enjoy. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Here is a poor translation of it, please forgive my english:
    \r\n\r\n\"A comment on my contribution thought on the Worldcup-jersey-Typografie
    came from the creator of the Puma typeface \u201D Pace \u201C, Bruno Maag. \r\n\r\nQuote:\r\n\r\nRegarding
    lowercase-writing: It is unusual, because you always see uppercase. But I find
    it refreshing doing things new. \r\n\r\nNo special characters for Polish: The
    Font has a full character set with all necessary specifications for West and Eastern
    Europe. If users do not use it, it is not a fault of the typeface. Other nations
    have managed to use their characters. \r\n\r\nOrganization of the numbers: there
    are clear regulations from FIFA and UEFA concerning the design-area. I think italizing
    the numbers is a refreshing idea. It indicates movement and the shadowline is
    a decoration element, which is not necessarily wrong. \r\n\r\nNames have different
    lengths: We have to live with this fact. Designing specific fonts with different
    widths is not a practicable way. Don\u2019t forget that the jerseys are made at
    local print shops (which aren\u2019t the best in typography). They simply get
    their font and insert the name. Period. It doesn\u2019t makes much sense to give
    them more opportunities. \r\n\r\nFootball jerseys have a fashionably expiration
    date: What we see at the WC today is out of date next year. According to it the
    Typo has to present itself. Balanced Typografie is not important, what matters
    is the uniqueness in the competition. In the case of Puma we chose numbers developed
    on a rectangle. \r\n\r\nTypeface Design: We co-operated closely with GBH Design.
    The basis were sketches, developed from a rectangle. Deliberately no curves were
    integrated. We worked on   different versions of the serifs, but in the end we
    decided that the current are the best. The problem of the readability is solved,
    because everything is written in uppercase.\r\n\r\nReadability: You always have
    to be aware in which cases the typeface will suit the purposes. The typeface was
    never be intended to be used anywhere else than on jerseys. For something longer
    than names it is not useful. And don\u2019t forget: The readers do not read letter
    by letter, they always read whole names\r\n\r\nBranding: Puma has succeeded in
    having created a profile against the competition (Nike, Adidas). All Puma jerseys
    use the same typeface. It is a beautiful example of corporate design.  I think
    that this typeface is perfect for the purpose. I do not know what happens next
    year  or at the European Cup also. Anyhow, the typeface is practically, either
    in fashion matters also regarding jersey-production. Finally, for me as a type-designer:
    The job was well done.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag, Dalton Maag Ltd.\"\r\nEnd of quote. "
