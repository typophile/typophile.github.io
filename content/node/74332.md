    signwriter sans.  \r\n\r\n(edit) Sorry ... you're asking about the 1 aren't you."

  body: Yes, probably made by hand, or some type that has been copied and cut up beyond
    recognition. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/clarendon_black_ot/?affid=99346">Clarendon</a>
    is your best bet.
