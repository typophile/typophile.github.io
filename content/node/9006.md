  body: This looks so familiar. It reminds me a bit of Nick Shinn&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-fontesque/sans-regular/testdrive.html?s=Answer+to+Cancer&amp;p=60">Fontesque
    Sans</a> or Jason Wallcott&#39;s <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000008">Baileywick
    Gothic</a>. If it is a House Industries face, the closest I can find is Countryhouse
    from their <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=GENCOL-FO&amp;sub=view">General
    Collection</a>.
