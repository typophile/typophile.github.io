body: "Okay, apologies in advance if I missed an earlier thread in my searches, but
  this has been driving me crazy and I need to move on with my life:\r\n\r\nIn 2005/2006
  <em>Print</em> redesigned to start using a cut of what is now called Gotham Rounded
  for the masthead, and Lexicon for the body text. But it looks to me now that Lexicon
  only appears in Print as an occasional display face--in fact, maybe it's not even
  Lexicon any longer?\r\n\r\nNo love from Identifont, after numerous attempts using
  different character sets and approaches, so here we are: Can anyone ID from these
  samples the body text face, the display text faces ('Vol. 27, No. 4', 'BACK ISSUE'),
  and tell me if the text 'Editor emeritus Martin Fox ...' is actually set in Lexicon,
  as it appears to be?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/print_sample1_6116.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/print_sample2_4144.jpg]"

  body: Florian I got to disagree - I've been using both Leitura Sans & News extensively
    (as part of a music festival identity) over the last 2 years and I've always found
    the fi ligatures pleasantly quirky. But each to their own taste, right?

  body: "Yes. you would lose the \u2018fl\u2019 ligature if you generally switch off
    ligatures. But since CS4, InDesign lets you define <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/68486\">GREP
    styles</a>. Create such a style with \u2018fi\u2019 as a search pattern, and \u2018ligatures
    off\u2019 as style attribute. Hope this helps. More about the power of GREP styles
