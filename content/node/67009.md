  in this logo is a font or hand drawn?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/taste_3427.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/taste1_4690.jpg]"

  body: "My guess would be hand-drawn, because of the way the letters 'st' interact,
    and the general very casual style. When there are no repeated letters it's almost
    impossible to be sure, because OpenType fonts now have many ligatures and alternates
    that could be used. My other data point is that it doesn't look familiar, for
    whatever that's worth.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
