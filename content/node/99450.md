body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI am a Graphic Design student and I am making my 3rd attempt
  to write a thesis. By writing here, I consider myself desperate, because I cannot
  find a topic for my thesis. The only thing I clarified for myself is that I am interested
  in typography and calligraphy. And writing a thesis on these topics could help me
  to use what I've learned in my future projects. \r\nAlthough I am reading everywhere
  in attempt to find something which would excite me, I am at a dead end. \r\nSo I
  am asking for your help. \r\n\r\nI have in mind some questions, but I am wondering
  if they could evolve into a thesis argument: \r\n\r\n1. Which are the limits of
  calligraphy?\r\n2. What's the connection between typography/calligraphy and music?\r\n3.
  Serif fonts are suitable for books (long reading), sans serif - for numbers. Excluding
  the aesthetic factor, \r\n    what's the purpose of semi serif fonts? \r\n\r\nI
  need some hints so I could move on in developing a thesis argument.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n"

    on how technical you are willing/able to be, you could consider something along
    the lines of the relationship between typography and musical notation, with a
    particular focus on the current technical and aesthetic limitations in producing
    musical notation digitally, as discussed in this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/90305\r\n\r\n"

    and choices for example during political campaigns.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe clearest
    example that comes to mind, that of Obama and Gotham has always struck me (in
    the limited extent to which I have given it any thought) as parasitic, rather
    than inherently or obviously complimentary. I think Gotham could just as easily
    have lent itself to any party and any campaign, given the right typographic perspective.
    Others will no doubt disagree and as other threads here will demonstrate have
    given it considerably more thought. That said, the nature of typography as used
    in political campaigns probably merits some study and could generate some worthwhile
    insights into both the nature of political branding and the contrast between the
    intent of the designer (where any exists) and the use of that type in the wider
    world.\r\n\r\nIf this is something that you choose to pursue you will no doubt
    get some perspective or insight on using content from Typophile as source material
    from [[http://typophile.com/readthetype|Christopher Timothy Dean]], the forum's
    eminent Typographic Cognitive Psychologist."

  body: "Thank you, Karl. \r\n\r\nI studied piano when I was little, but it never
    occurred to me that there is a special typography department for music. Giovanni
    Murolo made quite a great job in designing typefaces for notes. I am not so advanced
    in typography. Actually, I am just entering its world. My thesis should include
    research written in 10.000 words. The practical part will be introduced next year.
    \r\n\r\nWhen I asked about the connection of typography and music I was thinking
    of the words of R. Bringhurst from \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" where
    he relates quite often typography with music: \r\n\"Like music, it (typography)
    can be used to manipulate behavior and emotions.\", or \" [...] the practice of
    typography is like playing the piano - an instrument quite different from the
    human voice.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that indeed typography may influence our
    behavior and choices, for example, during political campaigns. I was wondering:
    based on which factors politicians are choosing their campaign font? Is it related
    to their political beliefs? Specific fonts are used from right wings and other
    fonts from left wings? etc. And how these fonts are affecting people's voting...

  body: "Hello, Karl!\r\n\r\nSince you are the only one interested in my subject (in
    some way), this is what I was thinking reading the \"typophile\" blog. \r\nThere
    is a lack of Greek fonts in Greece today. Those who are designing them in most
    cases are foreigners and not Greeks. \r\nHow anyone begins to design a Greek font?
    Based on which criteria? Which are the needs of Greek graphic designers today?
    Should it be based on Latin alphabet (which is a worldwide debate between typographers)
    or purely on Greek one? \r\n\r\nP.S. my adviser told me that since I am not going
    to specialize in politics, maybe it's not worthy to lose my time on such a research.
    He has a point... "

    cannot recommend highly enough reaching out to Gerry Leonidas. He is not only
    an expert in this area but on type in general and also head of the Typography
    Department at the University of Reading.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of expertise
    amongst the contributors on this site and most would be willing to give you pointers
    (myself included) where it seems constructive and relevant. However, if you specify
    the topic and start any new threads I would suggest being very clear about what
    you are doing and at what level."

    little, too late, but some thoughts and ideas:\r\n- Gerry Leonidas is in fact
    somebody you should definitely contact.\r\n- For a very different perspective
    also contact Panos Vassiliou.\r\n- For the musical angle there's one name that
    stands high above the rest: Frank Blokland.\r\n- Typophile is the best place to
    find discussions (especially involving yours truly :-) concerning calligraphy's
    severe limitations with respect to type. To me calligraphy fails to promote -and
    in fact essentially opposes- functional or cultural progress in type design.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    which, [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Blokland_rdrct.html|according to the DTL
