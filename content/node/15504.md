body: "Many logotypes seem to use characters derived from Handel Gothic. But, Hadel
  Gothic would be much better if it had a complete set of uppercase characters at
  the lowercase size and a complete set of lowercase characters at the uppercase size,
  I think.\r\n\r\nThis Omron logo seems to use the lowercase \"m\"s and the uppercase
  \"R\" (modified a bit); but, whenever I reduce an uppercase character to a lowercase
  size, the weight is too thin. \r\n\r\nDo you think the designers of this logo used
  a combination of a regular weighht and a bold weight of Handel (with slight modifications);
  or, is there a font that more closely resembles these letters?\r\n\r\nThank you...\r\n\r\n"

  body: No closer font. It's built of Handel, plus extra parts and curves. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.38.0.4&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=R&sampleSize=96">The
    'R' is very Eras</a>.

  body: If you need to rebuild it, it would be quicker to trace in Illustrator than
    start with a font.
