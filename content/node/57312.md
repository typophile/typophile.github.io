  identify this font from the cover of the Albert Watson photography book \"CYCLOPS\"?
  Did David Carson design it or someone else?\r\n\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/davidcarson-cyclops_4099.jpg.jpeg]"

  body: Yeah I have the book too, but never could determine where the font came from
