  body: I have no answer for you, but you probably will get more responses if you
    are patient and wait for 2 hours or more.  Also, maybe try adding a link to the
    font, since many of us will just give up if we have to do a search for the font
    just to see it.  The less effort it takes to respond to you, the more likely you
    will be to get a response.  Hope that helps (and I bumped your thread if it doesn't)!

  body: "Ah. Free? Never gonna get the same level of quality for free. It takes years
    to complete a professional typeface. You can look at lists like <a href=\"http://www.snap2objects.com/2009/09/16/17-trendy-slab-serif-free-fonts/\">this</a>
    but there will always be a downside: not enough weights or weights unsuitable
    for the intended use, bad spacing, bad outlines, missing characters, bad hinting,
    badly drawn glyphs, wrong diacritics, bad or missing optical corrections, anti
    creative solutions \u2026 the list goes on."
