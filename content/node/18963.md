  body: you need to make sure you installed the plugin to <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Photofont/Photofont/Installation-and-Compatibility/">the
    correct folder</a>, first off. This takes a little bit of finding, as the installer
    doesn't find the folder for you automatically. then you access them through the
    Filters menu. (it should show up at the bottom of the list).

      \ A few questions for you please:\r\n\r\n1.  What is the purpose of installing
      the font in the way you describe - using the Apple Installer?  I have installed
      it as a photoshop plugin and it does show up in the filter menu...what does
      installing it this way do for you?\r\n\r\n2.  You mentioned that you tried to
      sell photofonts but people only bought the case studies because there was no
      way to use them. Is it your experience that designers, who can use the fonts
      as plug ins, don't need them because they can just design what they want in
      photoshop anyway?  Is there not a market to designers who don't want to be bothered
      and want to use ready made colorful/image fonts?\r\n\r\n3.  You mentioned that
      there were good things to come technologically which could change things.  You
      said this back in April.  Can you elaborate on this?  Is there anything new
      you are aware of?\r\n\r\nI think it looks like a ridiculous amount of fun to
      design image fonts with photofonts/bitfonte, and I would like to do them to
      sell them.  Do you think there is no market for them yet?  What do you see the
      landscape to be in the near future?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLaura"

    couple of questions:\r\n1) Did you experience performance issues (maybe only on

    are problems.\r\n2) Does Photofont support negative kerning, and extensions above/below
    the em space? I thought it didn't, but in any case the Zapfino example is over
    250 pixels high, and more significantly the glyphs overlap laterally!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    like a normal application (using the Apple installer), and it gets installed in
    the Photoshop plug-ins folder. \r\n\r\nThe user can install photofonts in the
