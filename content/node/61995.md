body: "Since the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61385\">previous topic</a> became
  too hard to follow I decided to start a new one to gather some feedback from you.
  If you are interested in the whole process please read the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61385\">first
  topic</a>.\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n<strong>SUMMARY</strong>\r\nSimplease is a User
  Experience Company located in Austria. The company delivers simple solutions for
  all kind of Application Software and Websites/Web Applications.\r\n\r\nThe finished
  logo should on one hand represent the company and on the other hand be simple enough
  to use in footers at very small sizes. To achieve this goal I decided to create
  a wordmark only. The letters are custom-made characters mainly based on Futura Bold
  and Helvetica Neue Black. By replacing the capital \"S\" with a small caps \"s\"
  I was able to balance the logo better then in the previous versions. Removing the
  dot of the \"i\" was the logical consequence.\r\n\r\nLast week's process: Brand
  new \"s\"; Refined \"a\", \"e\" and \"p\"; More slender \"i\", \"m\" and \"l\",
  wider tracking to improve the reproducibility at smaller sizes\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n<strong>STATUS</strong>\r\nAt
  this time I dispense with colors and concentrate on a proper kerning as well as
  the right clear space.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your feedback on the current
  version.\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplease_logo_4699.jpg]"

  body: To my eyes the "ea" is looking a hair tight but I don't know if you can really
    kern that out any more due to the large gap created between the two round letters.
    The "i" also starts looking a hair short compared to the initial "s" (due I think
    to antialiasing) at the smallest size. Other than that I think it's working really
    well, it's evolved nicely.

    my eyes the \"ea\" looks just a bit too big. Also if I scan the word from the
    left to the right, all is good, balanced and consistent until I hit the e-a. It
    suddenly feels like I hit a hole in a ground, e feels sagging below the baseline,
    too much whitespace between e and a, the inner neg space in e looks too small
    compared to the neg space in other letters, especially the a .. \r\n\r\nHaving
    started at it for a while, I think the problem lies with the a. Try putting your
    finger over the a on the screen. To me the whole word starts looking far more
    consistent after that."

  body: "<strong>@epsilicon:</strong> Since I'm already working on \"Simplease\" for
    many months now, I've tried it in all kinds of different typefaces -- just for
    fun, without having a certain idea in mind -- and figured out that \"e\" and \"a\"
    are a nice couple when it's a double-story \"a\". They are nicely linked to each
    other, and that's exactly my \"problem\". If you look at the current version the
    whole word feels like it's seperated into three parts (maybe that's just something
    I see or imagine to see). This effect is caused by the negative space between
    \"m\" and \"p\" and the negative space between \"e\" and \"a\". They appear like
    little gaps but without ruining -- seperating -- the whole word. The idea is that
    these gaps are kind of subliminal hints for the words \"simple\" and \"please\"
    because you can read \"simple\" and then stop, and you can start at \"p\" and
    read \"please\". It's the way how the two words are perfectly combined within
    \"simplease\" that makes it part of my concept to make those subtle seperations.
    Another part of my concept is the single-story \"a\" which communicates -- at
    least that's what it's supposed to do -- simplicity. To not make it to scientific
    I decided to add a Helvetica-like \"s\". In my personal opinion the removed dot
    of the \"i\", the single-story \"a\" and the subtle seperations make it more logo
    and less text. Btw: the \"l\" is almost the geometrical center which might help
    grasping the gestalt.\r\n\r\nWell, that's my concept and if you think that \"e-a\"
    will never work with a single-story \"a\" I must make some confessions to improve
    the overall appearance but if you think that it might work I would like to do
    some more tweaking since I've already sold myself on the concept. You've called
    it nit-picking and I actually wanted it to work for customers and look nice to
    experts as well. Maybe the question is: Should form follow function? If yes, at
    what costs? Is the concept worth staying with a single-story \"a\"? Do you perceive
    it as typographically nice or as something that still has some mistakes?\r\n\r\nI'm
    looking forward reading more thoughts on this work and want to thank you a lot
    for sharing your knowledge which makes this forum my favorite online-place to
    be."

    space caused by \"ea\" I made some sublte changes to \"s\" and \"e\" to get about
    the same amount of negative space between them like between \"e\" and \"a\". Letter
    \"a\" looks more solid now but also feels less bold like in the previous version.

  body: "Underneath you find the current double-storey a version. I'm not sure the
    tweaks are 100% there but as you can see in the illustration, there is a nice
    progress going through the whole word. Let's just omit the initial \"s\" for the
    beginning. The \"simple\" part of the word is basically straight lines that receive
    more round parts, the closer they get to the \"please\" part, which basically
    consistes of round shapes. Especially the passage \"ple\", where both words meet,
    works perfectly as a transformation from straight and edgy to soft and round.
    As you can see in the illustration \"ple\" looks like straight, half-round, straight,
    round which feels well balanced to me. To come back to the initial \"s\"; together
    with the last \"e\" it helps the whole word to be equally balanced at both sides.\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/straight-round_4153.jpg]\r\n<ul><cite>The

    a bit with the outside rounding. I hope it works better now.\r\n\r\nAfter I've
