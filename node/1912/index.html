		<div class="commentbody">Kyle, <BR> <BR>I like the mark as well, although I must admit that I thought it was a paper company. Perhaps some sort of pattern integrated into the mark or background to allude to fabric/textiles? Also, I believe textiles are commonly distributed in round or flat rolls (imagine rolling up many many feet of fabric around something flat, like a yardstick). Just something to think about. <BR> <BR>In regards to the typography/layout/colors. While I like Faceplate sans, I'm not sure its the best choice for a company that does textiles. To me this face is a little too modern/techie/impersonal for the purpose. I would say the same about the color scheme &ndash; the muted blue is okay, but I feel that the gray is does not work. What about something a bit warmer &ndash; more natural fiber looking? Something from the off-white to medium brown range? <BR> <BR>Just some top-of-mind feedback for what it's worth. <BR> <BR> -t</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kyle, I like this. <BR> <BR>I kind of like Faceplate because it's kind of quirky and friendly but feels refined and modern enough. <BR> <BR>The mark is good, and I think you should stick with it. Pillows, rugs, curtains, and tablecloths? <BR> <BR>Tim's suggestion about the grey makes sense, but I haven't ever seen their range of product. A warmer grey almost brown could be pretty nice. Especially with the blue. Dark brown suit and a nice blue shirt.  Maybe they're too cool for brown. <BR> <BR>You may have tried all this stuff already so take it for what it's worth: <BR> <BR>What happens when you layout the card horizontally? Could you hang the mark in the left corner and stack info underneath the  sogno logotype aligned with the s? <BR> <BR>If you stay vertical what about aligning the information text with the imaginary centerline of the logo? <BR> <BR>Hang in there. Let us know what goes on. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

It seems to cut the card into two, and rather abruptly I feel. Would the design not be stronger without the white box? Just my two cents.  <BR> <BR>Be sure to post the final. <BR></div>

Maybe instead of printing the paper graphic you could stamp it or emboss it so it works on both sides of the card maybe even a diecut. Also think about using a textured paper. Its very stiff and needs to lighten up. Just my opion, Dan</div>

I also agree about the colors, most paper companies want to show off the brightness of their papers and how the ink jumps off the page, subtle colors and full coverage defeat that goal. Kyle you might want to be PC and use one of their recycled papers for the card and have the symbol and the percentage of recycling. The card, like an annual report can do more than post an url or phone number. Dan</div>
