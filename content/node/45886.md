  but I can't get it work properly.\r\n(Maybe I'm a tech-idiot ;-) but are there somebody
  who can help me with this issue:\r\n\r\nThe script only create new characters (composites)
  but it doesn't place the accents over these characters. Why not?? \r\nWhere do I
  exactly place the anchors on glyphs and accents, to get this script works correctly?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nMorten"

    sure you have assigned unicode values to them. Run the Macro.

    anything. I keep a list of characters in a text file and paste them into the Generate
    Glyphs dialog. The hard part is placing the anchors. I published a simple script
    to place commonly needed anchors here: [[http://betatype.com/node/12]]\r\n"

  body: "To explain a little more, here is my process:\r\n\r\n1. Generate common anchors
    using script\r\n2. Do any necessary tweaking to anchors (sometimes you don't want
    them centered)\r\n3. Select the Glyph > Generate Glyphs... command from the menu.\r\n4.
    Paste glyph list into field.\r\n5. Voil\xE1\r\n\r\nHere is a good place to start
    for a list of glyphs to paste into the input field:\r\n\r\n<code>Aacute Abreve
    Acircumflex Adieresis Agrave Aogonek Aring Atilde Cacute Ccaron Ccedilla Dcaron
    Eth=Dcroat Eacute Ecaron Ecircumflex Edieresis Egrave Eogonek Iacute Icircumflex
    Idieresis Igrave Lacute Lcaron Nacute Ncaron Ntilde Oacute Ocircumflex Odieresis
    Ograve Ohungarumlaut Otilde Racute Rcaron Sacute Scaron Scedilla Tcaron T+comma=Tcommaaccent
    Uacute Ucircumflex Udieresis Ugrave Uhungarumlaut Uring Yacute Ydieresis Zacute
    Zcaron Zdotaccent aacute abreve acircumflex adieresis agrave aogonek aring atilde
    cacute ccaron ccedilla dcaron d+macron=dcroat eacute ecaron ecircumflex edieresis
    egrave eogonek germandbls hungarumlaut iacute icircumflex idieresis igrave lacute
    lcaron nacute ncaron ntilde oacute ocircumflex odieresis ogonek ograve ohungarumlaut
    otilde racute rcaron sacute scaron scedilla tcaron t+comma=tcommaaccent uacute
    ucircumflex udieresis ugrave uhungarumlaut uring yacute ydieresis zacute zcaron
    zdotaccent</code>\r\n\r\nNote: There are several lesser known features available
    in the Generate Glyphs dialog. For example, t+comma=tcommaaccent joins t and comma
    into the tcommaaccent glyph. Fontlab knows which glyphs to join for all of the
    other characters. To create ligatures with Generate Glyphs simply type glyph1name_glyph2name=finalglyph
    name. For example f_f=ff will create an ff ligature.\r\n\r\nAlso note that generating
    the diacritics is often the last thing you want to do before you master the font.
    It makes it easier to manage things if you don't have a ton of diacritics hanging
    around."

  body: Be careful, when using Generate Glyphs in FontLab, "tcaron", "dcaron", "lcaron"
    and "Lcaron" can't create correct glyphs. All those four glyphs must have a special
    version of caron looking like a steep acute or an apostrophe. You could create
    "caron.alt" first and then build "d+caron.alt=dcaron" etc.

  body: "I wrote my set of accent building scripts before the release of FL5, which
    does let one build things quicker with how Christian outlined the Generate Glyphs
    dialog. You won't have the control over exactly how things are placed, but it
    is easier to use.\r\n\r\nHowever, if one is still interested in using the set
    of scripts, two things need to be done before running the Build Accents script.
    Anchors need to be placed on both the accent marks and the base glyphs for the
    accented glyphs. Anchors need to be named for where they are on a glyph and where
    the accent is to attach. For example, to have the script build an eacute, an anchor
    needs to be placed on the e at the location where one wishes the acute mark to
    be. This anchor can be called anything, but I usually call it 'top', as it is
    for accents that attach above the glyph. Then on the acute mark, a corresponding
    anchor, also called 'top', need to be placed where one wants the acute to attach
    to the anchor on the e. This would be at the visual center of the acute and at
    the bottom of the acute. The easiest way to think of this is that the anchors
    are the points where the e and the acute will snap together. Because placing anchors
    can be tedious, there is a Place Anchors script for placing anchors on the selected
    glyphs in the font window. (Removing anchors is also tedious, so there is a Remove
    Anchors script also).\r\n\r\nHope that helps anyone who may be interested in using
    those scripts."

    if you add anchors to your base glyphs and accents and name them right:\r\n\r\nThe
    name of the anchor on the accent must be the name of the anchor on the base glyph
    prefixed with an underscore.\r\n\r\nE.g. you have an \"o\" with a \"top\" anchor
    and an \"acute\" with a \"_top\" anchor. Now writing \"o+acute=oacute\" into the
    \"Generate Glyphs\" dialog will place the accent according to your anchors.\r\n\r\nAnother
    way to generate accented glyphs using this anchor naming scheme: Select your base
    glyph in the Font window, open a Preview window and there go to the tab called
    \"Anchors\". The Preview window will show you all glyphs you can compose from
    your selected base glyph. Generate them by clicking on the \"\xC2\" Icon.\r\n\r\ncf.
