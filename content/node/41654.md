  neither nor are quite right (a mix of both would be it, maybe).\r\nSee top sample.\r\n\r\nThe
  bottom sample I drew myself for the logo (based on Isonorm).\r\nI might stick with
  a custom logo and would need a face to go with it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/99OCTANsample_5704.jpg]"

  body: What about the face used for TypeCon 07? It is pretty tech in feel but is
    also really usable for Magazine sized texts. FF Sanuk. Also, what about Vista
    Sans. Or FF Din? Cachet is cool but I would shy from using it in longer texts.
    Sys & Etelkta seem in between.

    Two TV-station use it for their identity. You just see it everywhere.\r\n\r\nSanuk
    is an option. Thanks.\r\nConsidering Sanuk probably means considering Klavika
    as well.\r\nRegarding Cachet - we\u2019re not talking long texts here, just stationary
    and heads/subheads or/and short texts on the website."

    Jigger</a> is a similar take on Isonorm, but it''s more of a display face, lacking
    descenders. '

    Jigger is what Yves uses for his Unzipped Typequiz logo, right?\r\nIt\u2019s too
    much a display face and too ironic for my needs, though\r\n(and it\u2019s monospaced).\r\nAnything
    else more suited for text?"
