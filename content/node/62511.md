body: My former username was EricFromPtown. I posted on threads, read many more, and
  posted some sans serif designs. I changed my name because according to [[http://www.google.com/search?q=ptown&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a|Google
  PTown]] is the name for Provincetown, Massachusetts' Gay and Lesbian community.
  While I would not consider myself a homophobe, aberrant interpretation is a very
  serious offense in the communicative arts; thus I decided it was time to abandon
  the inter-webs moniker I've held since middle school. If moderators are reading
  this, feel free to delete the account "EricFromPTown".

  body: "The \"Edit / Additional Information\" allows you to change your full name,
    but there is no entry to change username...unless there is something I totally
    missed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a few Hollywood producers have shamed the MacLeod
    name with the Highlander movies (which I have never taken the time to watch).
    Thank you Jens for making that association; rest assured you aren't the first
    and won't be the last to point that out."

  body: Yeah, I guess the "raging" was unnecessary. It seems like homophobes are often
    considered raging homophobes. You don't hear much about the mellow homophobes
    if there is such a thing.

  body: It used to...that's what I was going for. I think it still does to us West
    Coasters, but the 2 first pages of Google results say otherwise. Portland has
    many other endearing nicknames like Rose City, Bridgetown, Stumptown, Rip City,
    PDX so it isn't a complete tragedy.

  body: 'In my neck of the woods P-town is Pomona. I guess it might as well be Placentia,
    too, etc. The name change is a bit like the ol'' boycotting Gill Sans because
    Eric Gill was such a monster conversation. I think you''ve drawn more attention
    to this than anybody would have on their own. But, as my late grandfather used
    to say when someone disagreed with him, "do as you see fit." '

  body: Maybe I'm taking this too far, but it is kind of important. The purpose of
    a username is to give some kind of insight about the person posting. That way
    if I posted in a Typophile thread saying, "Lloyd Reynolds is the foremost calligrapher
    in the 20th Century," then my appreciation of this fact could be attributed to
    being from Portland. If P-town is not understood to mean Portland, Oregon, then
    I am just another Lloyd Reynolds fanatic from some backwoods town.

  body: "On the east coast, P-Town does refer to Provincetown Mass out on the Cape.
    While it does have a sizable gay population, it certainly is not exclusively a
    gay/lesbian community.  I have visited there several times with my wife. There
    are lots of great restaurants and shops and a large art community. It is a good
    summer vacation place.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
