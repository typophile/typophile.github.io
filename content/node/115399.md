body: "This logo was used in the Netherlands around 1980 in a campaign to promote
  mussel. I have a vivid memory of the image, but this capture of an old video is
  the best I can find. The letters 'heerlijk! mosselen' means 'great! mussel'. I like
  to reproduce this logo but can't find the font or a good look-a-like. \r\nHope to
  hear your suggestions? \r\n\r\nCheers, Cornelis\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Heerlijk
