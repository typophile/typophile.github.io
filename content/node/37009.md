  <strong>exact name</strong> of the font used on this image\r\n\r\n[[http://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/70/703aa3f13428a6b328a1d1319569a4cd.36731.jpeg]]\r\n\r\nit's
  for a job.\r\nThe original designer is out of reach, of course, \r\nand we need

  body: "Jan,  Tophy's native tongue is French - and I think he did great in trying
    to express what he is after. He may not have posted a picture the regular way
    -- but has posted to where you can see the sample. This is a person who sincerely
    is asking for help. By the way, I've tried to put his image up -- and though it
    is a 600 pixel wide .jpg in RGB - and it says it's uploaded - it just isn't previewing...\r\n\r\nAnd
    Steve - thank you for trying. The \"S\" is not the same. The closest any of us
    at WTF came was Imago (from dafont.com) who thought Magistral was close. I wonder
    if the original typositor for Harry had alternatives - I'll have to check... probably
    did! In my old book Harry was called Blotto Black, a main S and two alternatives,
    but none of them looked like the sample... shucks.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone will
    find it for Tophy. Coup dedans l\xE0 (Hang in there) Tophy\r\n\r\nJackie T aka

    I just read it in the wrong fashion. My apologies. I can remember one Type site
    - that if you didn't do it exact, you were bombasted -- I think I'm just playing
    a left over tape... sorry if I offended you in any way.\r\n\r\nBTW, it's just
    my protective nature I guess, I am glad that Tophy came here for help on my suggestion.
    As much as I do love WTF, there are some IDs I find (when Philippe2 isn't around)
    that get ID'd quicker here.  \r\n\r\nI am surprised, I got the sample to upload
    to here, but in doing so, it put my response below yours... go figure. I didn't
    know that by editing, it moved the response to the last one..."

  body: "Wow, thanks to all, and to Stephen Coles.\r\nI wasn't sure that the original
    designer of the title ANATANE simply used a font \r\nor if he mixed a few and
    redesigned some letters, now it shows.\r\n\r\nI guess it's a mix of Harry Obese
    and some very heavy sans serif (Futura XBlack,  Antique Olive North redesigned...
    ?) for the N, D and K, \r\nthe S comes from another thing... \r\nOK, at least,
    we know where to start from, and that all letters are from the same font.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Jan, \r\ni know how to post an image, no problem, but i'm
    new on this forum, and i just couldn't find the way to visualize an image coming
    from a MyFonts page, \r\nas we usually write the tags [img].... [/img] to show
    an image coming from another web page.\r\nPlus, my home computer is a MacOs 9.2,
    Mozilla 1.31, which doesn't support the Attach image button, and decided to quit

    the full 100% match it is closer than Harry Obese. Note the A, K, N and R.\r\nS
    is still a bit of a trouble maker. Slightly modified S from Revue might do the
