I am sure that they chose the Gill for the circular &ldquo;O&rdquo; to make sense with the &ldquo;O&rdquo; rising in the logo.  I am not sure why they need both a serif and a sans though .  This may become more clear as we see more of the campaign materials though. (I do like the tight 08 as it seems to make a verbal rhythum.</p>

<p>That is certainly true. Still the weakness of the Kerry-Edwards logo was echoed in the campaign. &ndash;Accident?</p>
<p>I actually like it much better with the gradient, as it is clearly a sunrise. The red version above is generally much stronger as it is better balanced. Still, I think the graphic element is too cartoonish and weak. I hope Chris is right and it goes over well, but I have my doubts.</p>

<p>Here my very subjective opinion: The John Kerry campaign was weak. Their logo was also weak. Their campaign was not weak because of their logo. Even with the best logo in the world, it would have been just as weak, or maybe just a little less weak. But he still would have lost to George Bush.</p>
<p>Now, on the other hand, that his logo was weak in the first place may have been just another symptom of his weak campaign! ;-)</p>

<p>Yeah, Dan, that&rsquo;s what I was thinking. There&rsquo;s a lot of visceral, unconscious reaction to a candidate that has an effect, and their approving a weak looking logo to me was symptomatic. I am still upset with Kerry&rsquo;s miserable performance.</p>
<p>I saw two reporters interviewed about their very interesting book on Clinton and the current president Bush. Surprisingly, they said the two shared some things that were key to their electoral victories. First, they didn&rsquo;t get rattled when they had a reverse, but continued strongly on their campaigns. Second, they both knew what they wanted to do as President, and could say so coherently and forcefully, in 30 seconds, 3 minutes and 30 minutes. Of course Clinton knew infinitely more about policy, but that is another issue.</p>
<p>My main concern about Obama is that he may represent a beautiful spirit but not clear policy. Aside from opposing the war, which is of course very important, we don&rsquo;t know what he wants or how he would govern.</p>

<p>I agree - but I would go further.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;left*&rsquo; hasn&rsquo;t really taken their visual identity seriously since the days of constructivist posters. For at least the last 8 years the Republicans have. Even the logo W ( and it was a logo) was brilliant. It was brilliant because it falsely but effectively suggested a pal-like intimacy with W. I don&rsquo;t think for one second that it is merely or just sympomatic. I think these things count.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can call it that when referring to Kerry, or Gore or Clinton</li>
</ul>
<p>On that note, I hope Obama goes with a slightly heavier weight in future. The weight he has now is hopeful but not resolute.</p>
<p>I am not vainy imagining that a logo can make a party succesful. But it is one of the tools to get the job done! And when elections are won &amp; lost by narrow margins you can&rsquo;t afford to screw this stuff up.</p>
<p><cite> We don’t know what he wants or how he would govern.</cite></p>

<p>Obama has plenty of substance—it just doesn&rsquo;t show because the American media reduces everything to soundbites, a practice entirely unsuitable for Obama&rsquo;s style of politicking. In the 1990s this might have worked in his favor, as he would have been able to travel the nation speaking and actually provide worthwhile answers in the debates. In this election it&rsquo;s a liability, as the numerous early primaries limit his ability to do a lot of speaking, and the crowded field will either limit debate responses to minuscule amounts of time or drag the debates on so long that only journalists will be watching.</p>

<p>Race, as a topic of conversation, is always at its ugliest in the political arena. It&rsquo;s almost scary how crass, stupid, or downright nutty politicos appear when discussing race. Joe Biden is a perfect example; by bringing up race his run became what will be remembered as the shortest presidential campaign in history.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As creative people I think many of us would like to think that great design can help win a campaign. I used to think that. The short time I&rsquo;ve been here in Washington and been involved in politics&hellip;sadly, sometimes it &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mean sh!t.&rdquo; Its about money, people. No one goes to the voting booth because so-and-so&rsquo;s logo was cool. Who moved you? That&rsquo;s what people vote on. If anything, sometimes overly slick design can shoot you in the foot&hellip;people don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re real then. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather eat at the greasy spoon joint where they spend more money on butter, than that tré chic place down the street with the swan folded napkins and the cool logo. And I&rsquo;m a designer!</p>
<p>That being said, George W&rsquo;s materials&hellip;as Eben pointed out— were brilliant. But they could have been done with Arial and been effective. Its about concept&hellip;not the look. You can really focus on design and still lose a campaign, case in point: <a href=http://www.jimesch.org>Jim Esch for Congress&lt;/a href&gt;.</p>
<p>Lobbying, grassroots efforts, fundraising&hellip;there are TONS of other factors in play here. I&rsquo;m glad Obama&rsquo;s out there, but I think it&rsquo;s way too early for anyone to start dissing ANY candidate out there now. Underestimate no one, including Hilary, Giuliani, McCain and Edwards. We&rsquo;ve got nearly 2 years people&hellip;a lot can happen.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just read Obama&rsquo;s announcement speech on his web site. His site has this version of the logo:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obama08_3689.gif]</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite a bit better than either of the above. Better balance and the meaning of the logo is clear.</p>
<p>But I think Dan had a very interesting point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think that Congress people should have logos. I really don’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what makes me uneasy about the way Obama is presenting himself at this outset. This logo stuff is too much &lsquo;marketing&rsquo;&ndash;a calculated feel-good message.</p>
<p>The speech has something very good, and something disquieting about it. The very good thing is that Obama sees that a central problem is that our politics is broken in partisan wrangling instead of solving  problems.</p>
<p>What is disquieting, to me anyway, is that he seems to be relying on the force of his personality to change this. He says that good policies are not lacking&ndash;which I really questiion by the way. But more than that he does not lay out which policies he could make a reality, and why he could do it when others can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Dukakis, Gore and Kerry all had the same problem. As I mentioned above, the two journalist pointed out that neither Clinton nor Bush had that problem. I will be looking with great interest to see whether Obama can pass that test of self-definition in a politically successful way.</p>
<p>Marketing ain&rsquo;t going to do it. And certainly a logo or lack of one isn&rsquo;t going to do it. But they are revealing signals of what is going on, and not going on. Not as persuaders, but as indicators.</p>

<p>Our visual culture is in too deep now. We cannot go back. Unless you specify a standard ( which is a logo too of sorts ) then you will have logos. How is this avoidable?</p>
<p><cite> This logo stuff is too much ‘marketing’—a calculated feel-good message. </cite></p>
<p>If that the way it feels than it&rsquo;s not working for you. But again I think the idea that Obama or any serious candidate can <em>not</em> engage in what is effectively marketing is silly. It just is&rsquo;t avoidable. Marketing is just another name for convincing. It&rsquo;s the name of the process rather than the result. Marketing is what we call it when it&rsquo;s a product. Campaigning is what it&rsquo;s called in politics.</p>

<p>Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t clear. I absolutely think that the materials of candidates should be well designed, and there will be a standard presentation of their name.</p>
<p>What I think Dan meant, and what I mean, is the graphic that accompanies the name. It is creating a feel good graphic that makes me uneasy. Having the flag or bunting is fine, as what that says in the US is that you are running for public office. The sunrise-through-the-fog-with-a-big-O thingy is taking it to another level. And maybe too slick. I put &lsquo;marketing&rsquo; in quotes because I meant it in a bad sense&ndash;where the hype far exceeds the substance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I meant was that I don&rsquo;t think that Congresspeople, or even candidates for Congress, should have logos. That example that Terry Linked to is horrid. You can put together a noce look congressional campaign without resulting to logos and such a strict CI.</p>
<p>I think it is perfectly acceptable—and unpreventable—that presidential candidates have logos and real graphic identities. And, even though it sounds a bit crass, Obama is not a &ldquo;senator&rdquo; any more. Of course he is still sitting in the US Senate. But now he is a Presidential Candidate. This will consume most of his time and effort for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>While presidential campaigns do not hinge on their visual design, in my opinion, I think that it is OK that they have designs. Almost all other politicians should not have this however. I think that it is just too much.</p>

On more than one ocassion, I&rsquo;ve seen it reversed out on a dark blue background, and where the white sun disc is supposed to appear, it is instead the dark blue background color. It makes the &ldquo;O&rdquo; shape clear, but it ruins the symbolism. I wish I could find a photo of it. I just saw it on TV today on the front of the podium he spoke from.</div>

I can&rsquo;t think of one. This seems odd to me. Is it because she&rsquo;s a woman?</p>
<p>OK, I stand corrected. Rudy2008 (which IMHO should be the title of a horror movie).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Love that IKE badge. I like the muted red and blues I wonder if that&rsquo;s an idea worth pursuing for colour in a campaign, aged looking colours instead of the bright reds and blues, possibly communicating wisdom and history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an Australian, so I&rsquo;m interested in what people have to say about the American election process&hellip;BTW two things that strike me: Americans seem more informed/interested about politics than Australians and I am always surprised when I find out that intelligent/any americans choose not to vote.</p>
<p>FWIW When I think American presidential type, it&rsquo;s always something like Helvetica Black condensed oblique, oh and with stars and stripes of course, if it ain&rsquo;t broke hm I think Obama&rsquo;s looks a little wispy and maybe too country, but again I find it hard to believe that it will matter in the grand scheme of things</p>
