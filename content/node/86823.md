  body: "In your example, the way the background art meets the diagonal elements of
    the letters appears to be carefully constructed by hand (probably in Adobe Illustrator),
    so I'm not sure there's an \"efficient way\" of duplicating the effect.\r\n\r\nA
    similar (but not identical) effect could probably be created rather easily in
    InDesign by creating the diagonal lines as a separate art file, then in a separate
    InDesign file create and outline the text, import the diagonals graphic into the
    outlined type, similar to the importing technique explained here:\r\nhttp://www.ninisworld.com/thecorner/tutorials/imgintxt.html\r\n\r\nThen
    import the same diagonal lines into a background graphic box (behind the headline),
    and then rotate it. "
