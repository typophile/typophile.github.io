  body: "It's pretty similar to <A href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/stratum2/\">Stratum
    2 Bold</a> with the R leg moved towards the stem. This squared sans look is becoming

  body: "Unfortunately the posted sample doesn't show enough letters to see how good
    either suggested match is. The middle arm of the E in Nick's font is short and
    the closed C and S are not much like many of the techno fonts, since this typeface
    dates back to the 30's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
