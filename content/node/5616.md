body: A face with several distinct characteristics, but as yet no name! It can be
  found on the front cover of &#39;The Ralph Nader Reader&#39; as well as for the
  text. I have attached a link to the Amazon page, as you can see the book cover and
  inside for yourself much easier there. Note the lower case roman &#39;p&#39;. <BR>

  <BR> <BR>Any suggestions as to what this mysterious font maybe? Thanks for any help!
