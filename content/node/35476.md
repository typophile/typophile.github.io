  We get this info in Windows Word files, and need to port it to the mac side with
  COMPLETE integrity. Currently we cut and paste the pertinent info into a new word
  doc, save as a pdf, and then save an .eps out from Acrobat.\r\nI'm curious if there
  isn't a safe way to convert this text without jumping through so many hoops.\r\n"

    word (provided they have saved it in a format older than Office 2007)\r\n\r\nNow,
    the issue might be that they are using a font that you don't have installed on
    your machine. In that case, you either need to get the font, or they need to send
    it in a format like PDF with fonts embedded (or converted to outline).\r\n\r\n"

    for Office 2004 for Mac]] that allows it to open Office 2007 files, but it is
    unclear if it indeed does that from the descriptions.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php|Open
    Office/NeoOffice]] have filters that will open MS Office documents too, and they're
    free, though I'm unsure as to the level of compatibility.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Office 2007 files are a mess. We're having trouble using the converter on
    Windows machines.\r\n\r\nAlso, if these are pre-2007 files, and not overly formatted
    in terms of page layout, you should be able to open them just fine in TexEDIT."

  body: "You don't say *what* \"foreign languge information\" you are talking about.
    Word for Mac does not support as many languages as Word for Windows. For *some*
    languages the process you are using is one of the best and most reliable ways.
    For others, it is completely unnecessary and simply opening the Word file on Mac
    OS and changing the text to a font that supports the relevant language will be
    quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe languages that Word for Mac does not support most
    prominently include complex writing systems such as Arabic and the Indic languages.
    But if you name the particular languages or writing systems, it should be easy
    to determine.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
