  if anyone could suggest me a typeface for the title signature.\r\nThe movie is about
  the \u201870s Black Rio soul and funk movement in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Black Rio movement
  had to battle the odds \u2013 black soul was perceived as not being authentically
  Brazilian and the country was under the rule of General Emilio Garrastazu Medici\u2019s
  oppressive dictatorship which effectively suffocated cultural expression between
  1969 and 1974. Still, the movement took hold as disenchanted black Brazilian youth
  mirrored the struggles of their contemporaries in the US with their own potent brew
  of samba, soul and funk. Black Rio parties attracted thousands, bands including
  Banda Black Rio and Uniao Black were created from the scene and music figureheads
  like Jorge Ben began exploring more dense, Afro directions on albums including \u2018Africa
  Brasil\u2019.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using something super bold like Facebuster,
  but I can't make my mind up.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see a tiny trailer of the movie
  [[http://vimeo.com/4141936|here]].\r\nI had nothing to do with the titles on this
  trailer.\r\n\r\nGuerap\xE1(the name of the movie) means \"get up\" as it is pronounced
  with a heavy brazilian accent when singing Sex Machine by James Brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
