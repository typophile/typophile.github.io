  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I know, I know&hellip; Your stomach is churning from the subject line.</p>
<p>Here is the problem:  I&rsquo;m working at a University department that does applied research and also publishes documents.  All in-house, and out of Microsoft Word.  Currently there is no usage of &ldquo;styles&rdquo; in word and thus a document can get passed from author to author in the final stages of writing, and one adjustment by someone can potentially create more work in re-&ldquo;styling&rdquo; things to some ambiguous undefinable format, but an eventual &ldquo;end product&rdquo;.  So basically, font/headings/italics/locations of captions, etc etc are somehow decided at the end of the paper.  Without going further, it&rsquo;s a mess.</p>
<p>What actually gets printed is very minimal.  Maybe only 20 copies max, but many pages. (100-200 page reports)</p>
<p>The goal:  To be able to still use Word between authors to write a document and continue making adjustments without fear of destroying other&rsquo;s work in the process.</p>
<p>To throw another wrench into things: Cross Platform, this means Word 2007 and Word 2008 (for OSX), or at this time Word 2003 and Word 2004 (OS X).</p>
<p>Things I have already done:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Looked into using something other than Times New Roman, or Times on the Mac and placing it on every machine we use.  This is where style issues have occurred because it seems not everyone has the same font.  A designer that is helping &ldquo;rebrand&rdquo; this facility wants to use a Helvetica Neue and Sabon look to our papers.  We own the Adobe CS3 package, so we now own Garamond Premier Pro (but only Reg/Ital/SemiBold/Semibold Ital comes in that family.)  So I suggested instead of Sabon, we use Garamond.  (If Sabon was required, I would promote Sabon Next instead.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worked on creating rules and styles within Word, so that changes in heading size and look are restricted to what the ultimate end style can use.  Thus no one can assign a font (accidentally or intentionally) to a &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo; style, and when it gets sent somewhere that doesn&rsquo;t have that font, they can&rsquo;t mess up formatting of a document.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some questions/thoughts: As far as fonts go, within a family how many variations do we really need to publish a generic &ldquo;report&rdquo;?  Would you recommend getting caption faces?  Do the regular faces of Garamond not perform  well at smaller sizes?  What sizes?</p>
<p>What if an author wants to send a doc for review outside of our internal group, do we have to worry about issues and changes in a file&rsquo;s look if it comes back edited?   I assume it makes more sense for the authors to simply track changes, and blend any changes into their original document.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that we can consider to make publishing easier for everyone?  We are willing to do the work to get to that point, but we want to make it easier for authors in the end.  We don&rsquo;t want to turn authors into typesetters, but we want the look of their finished product to be of a good quality.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions at all, please let me know.  (I am aware Word stinks for publishing, save your stamp).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re your point #2, creating styles (or complete templates) in Word isn&rsquo;t going to solve the multiple editor/reviewer problem unless you can ensure that nobody will ever modify the styles &ndash; which of course you can&rsquo;t. Worse, you can&rsquo;t stop people from creating new styles (unique to themselves) and formatting the document using their styles instead of yours. Even worse, any number of people can create wildly different styles that all have the same name. IIRC, what happens then is that when A sends a document to B and B returns an edited copy to A, any of B&rsquo;s styles that have the same name as A&rsquo;s override A&rsquo;s styles. And if either A or B copies stuff into the document from other sources, those source styles go along for the ride too (unless the copy is done with a Paste Special as unformatted text).</p>
<p>There are other problems not related to styles. For instance, you might find that B is using a French version of Word while A is using English (I&rsquo;ve seen this happen even within the same company), and when one checks the other&rsquo;s spelling, typos go undiscovered.</p>
<p>Word change tracking? Not too bad when the only changes are to text, but not so good  when formatting is involved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fought this battle for years, and the only solution is to have one person maintain a master document that is never touched by anybody else, with internal and external reviews done using commentable PDF files. These can be created by Adobe Professional 7 or 8.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can only speak to small part of your question(s).</p>
<p>I format LOTS of very long documents, often books well over 500 pages. For internal government documents - which in many ways are quite similar in terms of needs &amp; audience to academic documents - I&rsquo;ve found a very narrow style using simply:</p>
<p>roman
italic
small caps</p>
<p>works very well. No bolds or semibolds; I leave that to the heading type, where I use various weights and widths of a titling face like your Helv Neue or something similar depending on the grid, space, hierarchy, etc. Also, no underlines; in 99.9% of all cases, italics do what bolds and underlines would otherwise.</p>
<p>As far as the proofing / writing goes, you might want to look at using Google Docs for proofing - it will track changes, allowing you to retrace your steps at any point; it will tell you who did what; it will keep all styles consistent between platforms and machines, and it can be shared with an unlimited number of people. You can also restrict permissions, I think, so that some people can read and not make changes, or annotate only, etc.</p>
<p>I am not sure how possible this might be, but I&rsquo;d also suggest not even beginning ANY typesetting / design until after the last person involved in editing has signed off on the document and it&rsquo;s ready to go. While I&rsquo;m all for cross-pollination, I think that the writing and editing stage of document creation MUST be completely finalized before typesetting even begins, as the smallest changes in length, formatting and general style will often completely negate tremendous amounts of typesetting labor.</p>
<p>Yours</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The key thing in my experience is to educate your authors/editors to use styles as much as they can. Remember this not only keeps formatting consistent but, perhaps more importantly during the editing phase, also labels the hierarchy of each paragraph in the document. If you&rsquo;re concerned with authors editing style definitions (most won&rsquo;t know how, though), keep them in a master template and reapply this to the document when it comes back to you. Good practice (per Gus&rsquo;s point) to also scan for rogue styles in the doc and revert these to your master styles. Stick to built-in style names as far as you can.</p>
<p>You can make applying styles more convenient by adding them to a custom toolbar, menu or keyboard shortcuts, rather than having to hunt through the Style Pane (which never seems to show you just the styles you want to use). You can also use macros to automate processes such as style cleanup, for example.</p>
<p>Remember that Word has a few odd habits - the document will be reformatted automatically for the current printer - this can mean that the same document has slightly different effective margins when seen on different systems, and page breaks can move. You can mitigate to some extent by using &ldquo;page break before&rdquo; on paragraphs rather than manual page breaks, but I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it too much and accept there will be some fine tuning at the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really too difficult to manage. You might be surprised just how much Word is used for publishing by financial firms, for example.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To further this&hellip; The reason we want to stick with word, and the reason we can&rsquo;t have it all flow through an editor all the time, is that the authors are (self-admitidly) lazy in attacking the report before it&rsquo;s due.

<p>One key issue I forgot to mention was that Word will output RGB files &ndash; so either you or your printers' prepress dept may need to use something like Pitstop Pro to convert to print colours. You can automate this so it&rsquo;s a one-click process.</p>
