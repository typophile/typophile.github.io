  any way to install any of the desktop softwares (OSX or Win) in an iPad?\r\n\r\nThe
  only one I found is iFontMaker. I didn't try it, It seems nice, but I think will
  be great to have something more professional.\r\n"

    Russian type designer. Naturally, the text is in Russian , but there are still
    plenty of pictures, and coupled with an automated translation it just might do
    the trick.\r\n\r\nhttp://kak.ru/columns/typexperience/a11323/"

    which is similar to FontShop's <a href=\"http://fontstruct.com/\">Fontstruct</a>
    (which can't be used on the iPad because it requires Flash).\r\n\r\nThere is no
    way to install desktop software on an iPad. It's based on OS X, but has a very
    different operating environment and application framework. The closest you could
    get would be to run something like <a href=\"http://www.iteleportmobile.com/home\">iTeleport</a>
    which would allow you to control FontLab (or other font editor) running on a Mac
    or PC from your iPad. It's useful sometimes, but not as efficient as working on
    an actual Mac or PC."
