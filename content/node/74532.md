    the last weekend edition of the present format.\r\n\r\n<em>I assume this has nothing
    to do with the new (/old) ownership.</em>\r\n\r\nRight. It's been two years in
    the works.\r\nThe main factor is new presses, enabling full color throughout,
    which they don't have at the moment, and the option to print (some sections) on
    coated stock. And the size of the standard north American web press roll has been
    further reduced. \r\n\r\nGenerally, the paper paper is becoming more magazine-y,
    as much of the traditional news function has gone to broadcast media and online.
    Redesigns also spike readership and generate buzz with advertisers, as well as
    addressing many content-driven issues."

    ago, then it was folded into a regular format \"Ideas + books\" feature section,
    for economic reasons. But it's still several pages of bona fide reviews.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, people (especially advertisers) are more interested in \"Wheels\" than
    \"Books\"."

    somewhere between the back end and the front end, due to the complexities of font
    naming.\r\nI had noticed that, but mentally grouped it with other things that
    it was impossible to fix due to their pagination system, such as the fractions.
    Although I should have mentioned it to them, rather than waiting for them to ask
    me to try and help them fix it. Muy bad.\r\n\r\nIf you thought it needed to be
    fixed, why didn't you draw it to my attention, or would you rather just nurse
    your grudge and relish being the smart alec pointing out the incompetence of others?
    \r\n\r\nAnyway, looks like there's not going to be much sans serif from now on. "

  body: "I subscribe to the Globe and look forward to it almost as much as my morning
    coffee. I'm trying not to be a stick in the mud, but I'm worried about this new
    development.\r\n\r\nHere are some drawbacks to the redesign:\r\n\r\n1. I am distressed
    to hear that \"there's not going to be much sans serif from now on.\" The sans
    serif type on the pages of the Globe is one of the big reasons I like this newspaper;\r\n\r\n2.
    A recent call to customer service informed me that the delays in delivery that
    an open letter warned about will actually mean that the paper will arrive at about
    10 a.m. That doesn't suit my needs for a daily morning paper, so I have arranged
    to put my subscription on hold until the delivery can be made early again (a week
    or two, from what I was told);\r\n\r\n3. What's wrong with black and white pages?
    There's nothing with more contrast that black on white. It's legible and most
    photojournalism worth its salt looks great in grayscale; and\r\n\r\n4. If the
    above sneak peek is a good indication of what's to come, there will be less news
    content on the front page. The trend of selling the inside of the paper on the
    cover is not so new, but it doesn't mean I have to like it either. The Globe's
    new look is not as extreme as what I get with my other daily newspaper subscription
    (The Winnipeg Free Press \u2014 image below from Wikipedia), but in my opinion,
    it's not as good a front page as what the Globe has been doing for the past few
    years.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freep_cover_6492.png]\r\n\r\nWith that
    said, I am pleased to see that the Globe and Mail is \"still a good client\" of
    Shinntype, so I will try to be optimistic."

    noted that in the discussion of the previous design, the fact that the columns

    typeface design. I'm assuming I just didn't read the post carefully enough. (If
    the typeface hadn't been condensed, I suppose it could have been blamed in a way,

    redesign to adopt an ultra-modernist layout, and balance its austerity against
    old style/humanist faces, rather than the usual \"moderns\" used for newspapers
    in North America.\r\nThe Globe sees itself as a leader, although perhaps more
    willing to buck trends in the 2007 redesign than this year's.\r\nThe 2010 redesign,
    by Adrian Norris, adapted the Pratt faces to an all-serif look, with optical sizes.\r\nSo
    those fonts are just my idea of what the old style could look like in a newspaper.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I think it would be nice if Canadian typographers used more Canadian fonts
    (instead of Helvetica and H&FJ), but that's the way things are, and as the majority
    of my font sales are to the US, who am I to complain?! I do get the occasional
    Canadian commission -- although not as many as Canada Type, for some reason :-)\r\n"
