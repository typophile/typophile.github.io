  Arnie \"The Govornator\" Schwartzenegger, but I finally had to interrupt my session
  because I wasn't able to ID this crappy looking 80ies font! I'd realy like to use
  it for an ongoing project plus I'd like to continue the movie, so please help me!
  My movie watching and book reading abilities already suffer enough from being obsessed
  with type!\r\nthanks No\xEBl"
