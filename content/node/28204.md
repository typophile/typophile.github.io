  correctly, and show me the different manners to write it (capitals, spaces, punctuation,
  abreviation, etc.) :\r\n\r\nOpen\r\nFrom Mon. to Fri.\r\n10 am to 18 pm\r\n\r\nI'm

  body: "The conventions in England and the US are sometimes different, so you will
    need to decide which to follow. \r\n\r\nIn the US the Chicago Manual of Style
    is the most widely used style book. It recommends either 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (note
    the space after the numeral and the periods in the abbreviation) or 10 AM to 6
    PM with AM and PM in small caps, no periods. \r\n\r\nThe 24 hour notation is used
    even less in the US than in England, though it is used.  \r\n\r\nedit: also in
    the US it is 10:00 a.m. not 10.00 a.m. If you have to set English often the best
    thing is just to buy a style book for either England or the US, depending. These
    questions are endless, even for a native speaker. "
