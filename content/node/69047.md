  body: "Looks hand lettered to me as well. All 3 E's are different.\r\nIf you're
    doing this for a class project and need to mimic I would suggest drawing or tracing
    it out in Illustrator, given the current differences between letters I don't think
    it has to be 100% perfect for it to look authentic. :)"
