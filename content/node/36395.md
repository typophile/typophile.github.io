  body: Perhaps a lighter form of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/lightline_gothic_sh_regular/?sample_text=BRUCE%20SPRINGSTEEN&sample_size=36">Lightline
    Gothic</a> available only pre-digitally. I suggest <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/titling_gothic_narrow_thin/?sample_text=BRUCE%20SPRINGSTEEN&sample_size=43">Titling
    Gothic</a> as an alternative.
