  body: With the exception of swashes and some details on /G it looks (a lot) like
    <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Linotype&ffam=ITC%20Cheltenham%20Std%20-%20Ultra&fid=de8e6a0d98546796cd1ff207cb3dd121&fsize=60&text=HIGHS%20AND%20LOWS&fit=1|Cheltenham
    Ultra]]</strong> but I can't find any Cheltenham variation with swashes... I don't

  body: "Cheltenham Ultra with modifications was the best I could come up with as
    well, although I could swear I've seen this 1970s-inspired look before.\r\n\r\nHAL-Highs
    and Lows is an Australian streetwear brand (est. circa 2005), and there does seem
    to be a complete alphabet for these characters, based on other visuals/tag lines
    I found. \r\n\r\nAny Australians out there who can enlighten us?"
