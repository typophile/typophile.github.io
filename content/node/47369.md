body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to know, what diacritics are frequently used in the
  small caps accented characters. Can i use the same of the lowercase or the uppercase?
  Or is it usually necessary to draw specific small caps diacritics?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  what glyph name/unicode value, refers to uppercase diacritics? I've opened some
  pro otf fonts and it looks like the name changes from font to font, but isn't the
  unicode value need to be universal?\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "What follows is just my opinion . . .\r\n\r\n1. The accents you need for
    small caps are all the ones you need with upper & lower case. If you don't have
    all of them, you are playing an odds game; betting that when you need small caps,
    you won't need a particular accent. Over 25 years of setting type has shown me
    this is not a good bet.\r\n\r\n2. As glyphs, I would use the lowercase accents,
    not the ones over capitals. My belief is that the flattened accents over caps
    came about so lines could be set with minimal leading. Setting solid or with 1-2
    points lead can give a problem if an accented cap appeares directly below a letter
    with a descender. When you use lc accents with small caps, they may have to be
    positioned a bit higher of course.\r\n\r\n3. Any special accents to go over caps
    or small caps should not be given a Unicode number, only a name. To the best of
    my knowledge, there is no universal name that would make an applications program
    pick the right one. If you are using FontLab to create precomposed characters,
    the name is XXXX.case. (e.g., macron.case) works fine. If you then click on cells
    for Unicode 0100 and 0101, the \"macron.case\" accent will be used for 0100, and
    the \"regular\" macron for 0101.\r\n\r\nBut as far as I know, if you enter the
    hex sting string 0041 and 0304,  you are not guaranteed getting the \"capital\"
    macron in all applications programs -- one thing that for me tips the scales toward
    using \"ccmp\" as opposed to, say, \"mark\".\r\n\r\nMaybe one of the more knowledgeable
    OT features programmers will reply here.\r\n"

    caps are the same as for upper and lowercase, my question was only about their
    scale and proportion in relationship with the ones in the upper and lowercase.
    \ \r\n\r\nEnglish is still a problem as it ain't my mother language :)"
