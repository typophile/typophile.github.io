body: "Hi\r\n\r\nAnybody know a way of programming a font so that it remembers you've
  typed a letter, and the next time you type that letter an alternate glyph is used?
  \ This would be useful in distressed fonts.  Ligature substitution is ok for double
  letters but if I type a word like 'dada' say, and I want to make sure the distressed
  look isn't repeated, it doesn't help.  \r\n\r\nI have a feeling it should be simple
  enough to do this - somehow get typing a letter to flick a switch and then if the
  same letter is typed while that switch is on, substitute an alternate glyph then
  reset the switch.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    Puckett's Recovery is the first font I've seen to do it this way, you should take
    a look at that. I've done it a few times for private fonts with excellent results.

  body: "You mean Black Monday, the grunge version of it?  That's what I'm trying
    to achieve.  Just looking at the Myfonts page for it, it looks as though the randomisation
    is processed via the liga feature, but then looking in the glyph table there don't
    appear to be many ligatures.  I'm guessing the programming reads something like
    \r\n\r\nsub @class1 @class1' by @class2\r\nsub @class2 @class1' by @class3\r\n\r\nso
    they rotate round the stylistic sets.\r\n\r\nI guess this would work without too
    much glyph repetition with three stylistic sets.\r\n\r\nWould be interesting to
    see the coding on black monday.  Seems to make the sets rotate thus: 1 2 3 2 3
    1 3 then repeats"
