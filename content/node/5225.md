  to know what went on in the Golden Age of instant photography before bean counters
  and corporate stiffs fouled the nest. Comment and ask questions and we&#39;ll keep
  it going as long as there might be interest in &#34;the olden days.&#34; Here&#39;s

    and someone who enjoyed Peter Wensberg&#39;s book <i><a href="http://www.biblio.com/books/10018798.html">Land&#39;s
    Polaroid</a></i> and then dearly ached for ever more information about the company,
    your blog is a great find. <BR> <BR>Thank you.

    stuff that was being done in the 50s, and what a dramatic graphic presentation
    you designed and executed. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Thank you, Grant and John. I hope it will live up to your expectations. I
    recruited Pete Wensberg for Polaroid, which he mentions in &#34;Land&#39;s Polaroid,&#34;
    and I will describe the players pretty soon as I add posts.
