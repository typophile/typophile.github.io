  body: I really like that r.  Don&#39;t care much for the head on the t, and the
    j sort of peters out towards the bottom.  The s doesn&#39;t go with the rest of
    the characters very well.

  body: It tastes a bit like palatino but I like this kind of modulation you used,
    I thik it is going to have a nice color in paragraph. Uppercase is still unbalanced
    and uneven in color,  <BR>&#34;A&#34; has a good color.

  body: 'Hi Ricardo <BR> <BR>The steams of the Uppercase looks diffrent in width.
    <BR>lc &#39;b&#39;: mmh.... I dont like the bottom curve... <BR>lc &#39;w&#39;
    and &#39;v&#39;: maybe to gemetrical <BR>lc &#39;x&#39;: Great! But will it work
    in small size? <BR>I like the curves of the round glyphes! <BR>The tail of lc&#39;y&#39;
    maybe needs a point at the end &#40;maybe also for &#39;j&#39; &#39;f&#39; and
    &#39;c&#39;&#41; <BR> <BR>Greetings to you! <BR> <BR>Jens'

  body: Sorry Ricardo, you are right, the comment was a little confusing :-&#41; <BR>
    <BR>What i mean was that you maybe should do this point a little bigger. Currently
    it looks like that the downstroke goes in a little curve... <BR> <BR>The Uppercase
    is a first sketch i see so you improve anyway... Horizontal lines are very diffrent
    Compare lc &#39;E&#39; and &#39;L&#39; <BR> <BR>Happy fonting!
