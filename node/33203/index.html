<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I have been working on a new Unicase Serif. These seem to be all the rage these days. This one is extended more than most. I have attached a quick .gif preview and a .pdf for more detailed examination. I think I have a few issues with the weights on the n, m and r. Please ignore the preliminary spacing for now. All comments are welcome.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Jeremy
I like the ideas of most of your fonts, but you really have to spend much more time on the outlines. They are all very bulky and unshaped. Furthermore I think that you get stuck on your sketches. You should try to experiment a bit with the shapes.
Greetings: Steven</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stephen,
Thank you for your comment. I agree that I tend to get stuck on my inital sketches, and I feel I am a in a bit of a rut as far as some of the shapes I have been using recently. Thank you for challenging me in that area.
I must admit I am having difficulty locating the bulkiness you mentioned, with the exception of a few characters that need work (the Q, n m). I've touched up the Q, K, u z g and s, and I will post those revisions shortly. The letterforms are deliberately extended more than most. Is that what you are referring to?
Thanks,
Jeremy Dooley

<div class=commentbody>It seems like one of the biggest hurdles in Unicase fonts is the spacing since you will be making unusual combinations like 'eP' all the time. Overall it feels too tight. I would look at some small cap spacing & see what they are doing to make that work ( as opposed to regular caps which often look clunky without intervention ). Also, how do you see this being used? That's important. </div>

<div class=commentbody>For extended text setting - yes. For doing the name of some noodle shop maaaaaybe it's okay. I think with some greater sense of purpose good choices can be made. BTW Jeremy, you might want to look at some other unicases as well. See what choices they made. Nick Shinn has one for instance.

<div class=commentbody>A unicase is a bit pointless, period. :-/
On the other hand as Jeremy implies fashion is important in type, so...

<div class=commentbody>From a retail point of view they probably are pointless since there has never been a popular one. But as a learning process a unicase might be quite useful - for learning to see and understand letter relationships. No? But it might be a 300 level course not a 100 level... </div>

<div class=commentbody>The intended use is logotypes, headlines, etc. It's a display type. I doubt too many people would want to set text in a unicase font, especially one this wide.
I agree that the spacing will be difficult, but I've started on it.
I agree with Hrant about the usefulness of a unicase. Really, as far as pure usefulness and unicase isn't very versatile, with my apologies to the Bauhaus crew. Despite the fact that it’s a unicase, I tried out the g, and felt it worked pretty well, so yes, there are a few characters with decenders. Honestly, I understand why quite a few people don’t care for unicase typefaces, but part of the charm of a unicase font is its inherent inconstancies. But why can’t it be successful from a retail point of view? Filosofia is widely used, I would say largely because of its unicase weight.
I've made a number of updates. The latest is posted here.
