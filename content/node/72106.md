  was printed using one of my fonts in the designs.\r\nWhat can I do?\r\nI cannot
  afford a lawyer and the country i live and work in doesn't have contingency based
  lawsuits.\r\n\r\nI bought the item and made plenty of photos and an evidence file
  in which i overlapped the two letterings.\r\n\r\nI will be glad to have any form
  of advice on this :)"

  body: I have a friend that happened the exact same thing to. It was a large chain
    of clothing stores known for their lax relationship to intellectual property.
    The typeface designer contacted the company by email with the proof and was then
    contacted to negotiate a compensation. He got some thousand dollars for the one-time
    use. It was a US company, and they are so afraid of litigation (because of the
    cost) that they will move to have the issue settled quickly. Good luck!

    you?

  body: I see my fonts on shirts all the time. Isn't that why we make fonts? So designers
    can use them on their products? I would take it as a compliment personally.

    see how those two statements fit together, a thing can either be a public domain
    or non-commercial, but not both."

    because nobody bought it. And if the stolen font is as ugly as Diskoboll, the
    thief should be punished for his bad sense of taste."
