  body: "Over 12 hours & no match. I don't have one either.\r\nProverbe looks similar
    to the condensed version of Corvinus, designed by Imre Reiner around 1930, which
    was sold as Skyline. But Proverbe does not have the very flattened sides of the
    round letters used in Skyline. Other suggestions?\r\nDon"

  body: "A great many old fonts have never been digitized.\r\nBut sometimes I can
    find a match in an old catalog or other source. So at least you can get a name,
    even if there is not a precise digital match.\r\nIf you have any idea of the source
    of these images it would help. For example wood type museum, & where. If its \"found
    on the web\" a link would help with digging.\r\nDon"
