  body: "Not to get all pendantic, but \"old style lining figures\" is a contradiction
    in terms. \r\n\r\nOld style figures are the ones that dip below the baseline;
    the ones with ascenders and descenders, if you will. There are still lots of Postscript
    fonts floating around with \"OSF\" tacked on to the name to indicate that they
    use that figure style.\r\n\r\nLining figures are like the ones in your sample:
    all figures sit on the baseline, and the characters are a consistent height.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It seems that I was too excited to use that contradiction to realize that
    this is actually either a transitional or a slab serif font.\r\n\r\nThe serifs
    don't look slabby enough to be Century, but that may be because of the way it
    was applied; it was probably outlined in pencil and then filled in and distorted
    slightly. "
