body: "typotherapy+design, Keep Six Contemporary Gallery and the Festival of  \r\nArchitecture
  and Design invite you to\r\n\r\nMyType: An exhibit of limited-edition, new modernist
  posters by graphic design genius Noel Nanton.\r\n \r\nExhibition dates: May 2- May
  18th. 2008\r\n\r\nFeaturing new fonts designed by typotherapy, eye-popping popsicle
  colours, bold abstract shapes, \r\nand a very new take on classic modernist typography.\r\n\r\nStarting
  with the premise that typefaces are as expressive as the words they form, typotherapy
  \r\nhas created a series of large-format posters that explore the relationship between
  positive and negative \r\nspace. Letters speak, and if you remove them from the
  constraints of sentences and even words, they \r\nhave a language of their own.
  \r\n\r\nMyType uses the craft of typography to find new ways of speaking  \r\nusing
  fonts famous and unknown including Helvetica, Avant Garde and  \r\ntypotherapy creations
  like Tomeri and VWmobile.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit: www.keep6c.com  and
