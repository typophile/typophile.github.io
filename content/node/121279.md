  body: "Probably not a publicly available font. Rather, it could be a font built
    into the printing machine.\r\nSome general similarity of the numbers to AG Book
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-book-pro/\r\nThe large bowl of _5_ is
    found on relatively few fonts. For example Scout https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/scout/
    \r\nAs for the letters, they are a rather generic condensed Gothic/grotesque with
    some unusual features such as the convex leg on _R_ and the straignt section on
    the diagonal of _S_\r\nDon"
