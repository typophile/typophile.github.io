body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if anyone can name for me a typeface
  with bracketed serifs and even strokes (no thin/thicks)?\r\n\r\nI can't seem to
  think of, or find any with these qualities, but there MUST be some (unless it breaks
  some kind of rule for non-slab-serif serif fonts to NOT have thick/thin strokes?)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nAND
  (if anyone knows) - is there a SERIF typeface based on Gill Sans that is not Perpetua?
  (Again, perhaps one without the humanist strokes?)\r\n\r\n\r\nHope someone can help!\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much,\r\n\r\nSamantha"

    has little stroke contrast: Officina, PMN Caecilia, Vista Slab, Centro Slab from
    Parachute Type, Manual Slab from Ole Sch\xE4fer, etc.\r\n\r\nBut monoline slab
    serif with bracket is rare. The only example I know is recent: [[http://www.type-together.com/Adelle|Adelle]]
    by Type Together."
