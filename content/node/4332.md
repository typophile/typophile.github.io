body: Hi, I have the .font version of this font. I&#39;m wondering where I can find
  a .TTF equivalent, preferably the same font. Or if there is any way to convert it
  to .TTF. And I really don&#39;t want to spend any money on this. <BR> <BR><a href="http://binary.phys.ncku.edu.tw/~justin/cure.jpg">See

  body: Are you looking for the pixel font? Or the display face shown in the larger
    sizes. The font shown at 60pt and 72pt in your image is Letraset&#39;s <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=EFT0000007">Algerian</a>.
    It&#39;s available in the Elsner &#43; Flake library in PostScript, TrueType and
    OpenType flavours. As for the pixel font, I can&#39;t seem to find any reference
    to it at the regular haunts &#40;Miniml, FFF, etc.&#41;
