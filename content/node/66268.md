body: "Hi everybody, \r\n\r\nI am currently working on a Kinetic Typography project.
  I have to animate the lyrics of a song. The one I chose was ... Rob Zombie - Two
  Lane Blacktop, because I recently watched the movie by the same name.\r\n\r\nIf
  you've heard the song, you would know that, it is a very \"in your face\" track.
  I wanted to ask what kind of a typeface would go with it? ... I don't want to use
  \"decorative fonts\", and when I use Helvetica, DIN, Avant Garde, Rockwell etc.
  they seem to be very neutral, or just inappropriate.\r\n\r\nHere's the kind of stuff
  I've done earlier this year:\r\nhttp://www.vimeo.com/user2388063\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSumit"

    for animated text is that you can swap (or wait, morph!) the fonts in the system

    play more true heavy rock.

  body: I would try looking for a combination of horror and hot rod fonts for Rob
    Zombie. Go check out <a href="http://www.houseind.com/>House Industries</a>, they
    have TONS of fonts that fit either category. If you go with the more "traditional"
    blackletter, Blaktur is a good way to go.
