  body: 'Mike Freiman &amp; Ives Peters: thank you, both, for your help. :-&#41; I
    had already been to DaFont also, checking on their dingbats section, and even
    posted my request there too, as well as at MyFonts, but, unfortunately, have had
    no luck at either of the forums so far. Then again, and to Dr. Alderete&#39;s
    Rubias Morenjas Pelirojas, well, regardless not being free, hmm, that is also
    not quite what I&#39;m looking to find... I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a bit too much
    retro/fifties/comics style for my purpose... I&#39;m searching for something actually
    more modern/real looking...  Manfred Klein&#39;s PeopleSketches, on the other
    hand, has a couple of characters &#40;&#34;v&#34; and &#34;m&#34;&#41; that might
    come close to do it, thank you again for that one. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Any additional
    tips are, certainly, greatly welcome as much as appreciated!'
