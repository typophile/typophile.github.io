  body: Not really, no :) I have no idea what it means. (I could think about it awhile
    like a rebus, but that would be counter to the point...)

  body: It reminds me of those YouTube music videos that chop up the lyrics into tiny
    meaningless pieces and assigns each one an image from Google. You've illustrated
    "on the top", you've illustrated "every", and you've illustrated "page". You're
    not treating the phrase as one coherent thought.

  body: "What do you mean by \"comunicating the message using typography\"?\r\n\r\nDoes
    that mean the message should be carried in the way the words are crafted, not
    in the meanings of the words?"
