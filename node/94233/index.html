<p>By &ldquo;best&rdquo; i mean what this foundry offers in terms of language support, opentype features, hinting quality, best pricing, best library, and the overall quality of the design of the typefaces.</p>
<p>So from experience can some of you veterans help me out here?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">A hard question to answer. I’ve found some of the most reputable foundries to produce faces that – all the while amazing conceptually and technically – doesn’t really cut it when you put them to actual use (perhaps the technical bar was misguided?). Likewise, the best technical productions are not necessarily very creative. When you also throw hinting into the criteria mix, the whole thing is flipped upside down.</div>

Currently im looking at Linotype, Berthold, Font Bureau, and ParaType.</p>
<p>For one example im looking at buying Akzidenz Grotesk, Berthold offers BQ and BE versions (can anyone elaborate on the difference between the two?) and Linotype offers Basic Commercial; which would be the best route?</p>
<p>Also im planning on doing a mix of digital/web/print work (most likely mostly digital/web work) if that helps at all.</p>

<p>I think that both BE (possibly, &lsquo;Berthold Exclusivs&rsquo;) and BQ (again possibly, &lsquo;Berthold Qualität&rsquo;) versions are based on Postscript Type 1 digitisations by Adobe but with a split in the licensing, with Adobe selling the BE versions through their Font Folio collection up until version 8 and the BQ versions only available through Berthold and a variety of third party distributors.</p>
<p>Both versions are now available through the Berthold web site but the following notice is posted to distinguish between them, &ldquo;The BQ and BE OpenType Basic versions correspond to the Berthold BQ and Adobe BE PostScript Type 1 Legacy versions.&rdquo; Further, the BE versions in OT are only available with basic language support, roughly (if not exactly) equivalent to Adobe&rsquo;s defined Std character support, while the BQ versions are available with with Pro and Pro + WGL language support.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone else here could elaborate on this, but this is very much my own understanding and opinion based on information cobbled together over several years.</p>
<p>As to whether to invest in either of these, well personally I would probably go with a more contemporary take on this style of typeface. Also, to the best of my knowledge, there are currently no web font versions available and the cost and restrictions associated with digital embedding and licensing are not clearly defined on their website.</p>

<p>From Huxley&rsquo;s post it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s not a typical user - he&rsquo;s picky. And picky people like to tweak things.</p>
<p>At the very least people like Huxley should be made much more aware that most foundries don&rsquo;t allow free modification; it&rsquo;s almost like a hidden charge, something I&rsquo;m firmly against.</p>

<p>A generalization, jumped to most likely for the purpose of &ldquo;discussion enhancement&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s cool. It could also be that the picky user chooses a few foundries for exactly the opposite reason — they don&rsquo;t want to be compelled by fondness of form into making any mods due to faults in function, and they want to minimize that possibility via their choice of foundry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;almost like a hidden charge, something I&rsquo;m firmly against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How should founders expose this &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; possibility of an extra licensing requirement for those who may possibly want to take our work and partially or wholey make it look otherwise, for better or worse, something we don&rsquo;t know up front 100% of the time? :)</p>

<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Sometimes though overall quality doesn&rsquo;t preclude the need to tweak. Adobe fonts are high-quality, but I still once got a commission to extend Garamond Premier with some esoteric accented characters, something I could do legally.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Good question - I&rsquo;m not sure how to do that elegantly. Mainly I worry that some foundries are happy to keep it hidden. And the reason it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; is because I believe most font buyers don&rsquo;t expect a no-mod restriction to be there. So it&rsquo;s a matter of education (which is what I&rsquo;m trying to do, in a small way). And I think when enough buyers realize that restriction has become the rule (AFAIR it didn&rsquo;t used to be) then foundries will be pressured to be more accommodating, or at least more transparent. Why do I care, as somebody who tries to sell fonts and rarely needs to buy them? Because I think ethical behavior is something that comes around when it goes around. And as I&rsquo;ve opined before, there&rsquo;s something vaguely unethical with being draconian about user modification, since any font we make owes things to others anyway.</p>
<p>BTW, about &ldquo;discussion enhancement&rdquo;: Although I firmly believe in publicly going out on a limb with borderline opinions, they&rsquo;re always on my side of the border - I don&rsquo;t say something I don&rsquo;t believe in just to get people riled up, I actually believe in it. That said, beliefs change, and that&rsquo;s OK (it&rsquo;s probably even good).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to say with complete unbiased authority that the foundry that best meets all of these criteria is Microsoft. If you&rsquo;d included modification rights and/or weight variation availability, that would not have been the case. If you&rsquo;d excluded language support I would have nominated The Font Bureau.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As you imply, educating consumers on &ldquo;buy&rdquo; versus &ldquo;license&rdquo; is part of the conundrum. But the reality on the ground is that when somebody plops down the dough to get something, they think of it as &ldquo;buying&rdquo;. Virtually nobody knows what an EULA is, much less go to the trouble of reading the thing. It&rsquo;s just not humanly natural; nobody would go for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->having<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to read (and understand!) an EULA before being allowed to use the product. Now, we certainly can&rsquo;t change human nature, and we probably can&rsquo;t change the sue-happy trench we&rsquo;re stuck in in the West, but my main point is we shouldn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->take advantage<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of lack of education. And to me the &ldquo;no-mod&rdquo; clause stands out as particularly potentially dishonest; I&rsquo;m starting to think we need an explicit opt-in on it, to be sufficiently ethical.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Even though we specifically allow font modification in our EULA, I don&rsquo;t think this point matters much in choosing fonts and foundries. (Quite unlike embedding permission, media restrictions and things like that.)
Well sell software tools — ready to use — no assembly required. You can&rsquo;t even open and “save” a font non-desctructively like you can with a Word file. A normal type user would always mess something up. If you want your users to change the fonts you should give them your original files from FontLab, Fontographer, Glyphs, RoboFont, &hellip;
So the requirement to be allowed to change the font files only applies to a tiny percentage of type users, mostly those who are type designers themselves.</div>

<p>If so, this should apply to truly unexpected limitations in the EULA, that affect normal type use. 
For example: Type users are often shocked to find out, that the license they purchased doesn’t cover the creating of a logo or the embedding of the font in a regular subsetted PDF. These limitations might require an extra warning or checkbox during the purchase.</p>
<p>But like I said: Changing a font file is not normal type use. If you license something, you expect to be able to use it as is. If I license a software tool like InDesign, I don&rsquo;t expect to be allowed to reverse-engineer it. I expect to be able to use it “normally”. 
And if a few type users really want to make changes to a font, they can just ask the foundry. The foundry either allows it (despite what their EULA says) or they make you an offer to do the modifications you want. No big deal.</p>

<p>Good point - agreed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At double, triple market prices, is my point. And if they&rsquo;re too busy to bother, they sometimes just say No. These complications wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if users knew about them before purchase; but we don&rsquo;t really try to be transparent about it&hellip;</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s actually more font modification going on than we think, because users just do it without telling us. Besides ethics I think there might actually be material gains to be had by being fully open about modification issues. And most of all, you don&rsquo;t want a user getting in the habit of breaking the law (at your expense). If a user comes to terms with breaking your EULA by modifying a font, next time he might break the EULA by not even bothering to pay for the thing&hellip;</p>

<p>This is not what the no-mod eula is made to prevent. We, and many others. including the MS foundry, are trying very hard to make it so that every one of the tens of 1,000&rsquo;s of fonts that have the same name (sometimes the millions of fonts that have the same name), when given the same composition specification, exhibit the same behavior.</p>

<p>hrant &mdash; I&rsquo;m a designer and lover of typography, but not a typeface designer. Still, it seems pretty simple to me:
&ndash; You purchase a license to use a font under conditions you agree to.
&ndash; If you don&rsquo;t like those conditions, or you have a concept for a rethinking of an existing typeface, you can make your own font. Go ahead. Software is available.
&ndash; If you don&rsquo;t have the skill or time to design a typeface and build a font, then you should choose an available option.</p>
<p>Modification is not difficult to accomplish. You&rsquo;ve already said you&rsquo;d be willing to pay a type designer to make the modifications for you. So why not contact the originator of the font you like and contract for the modifications you want to make? I think you&rsquo;ll find them to be open to the concept and pleasant to work with. But you have to pay them for their work.</p>

<p>The design community has a different understanding of what “creative” means than the standard dictionary adjective deﬁnition (which could apply to suits, to our chagrin), hence a face like Verdana, despite the innovations of its design process and functionality, will never be considered truly creative—it looks too plain and corporate.

<p>To your original question &ndash; I hesitate to answer. There are some tremendous foundries, but none that are the best option for all challenges. Each offers advantages &ndash; quality of design, quality of function, preferred genre, voice, support, technical chops, customization options, price. The relative values depend on your needs.</p>
<p>Best advice I can offer re searching for foundries:</p>
<p>&ndash; Enjoy the ride. There&rsquo;s a lot to learn, and no end to it. Sounds like a bad thing, but it&rsquo;s not. 
&ndash; Familiarize yourself with the foundries and designers out there. Study their typefaces. Study their approach and typical offerings.
&ndash; Learn as much about font technology as you need (it&rsquo;s a rabbit hole). Enough to understand what you&rsquo;re asking for.
&ndash; Shop for designers and foundries (as you are), not fonts. Match sensibilities. Build relationships.
&ndash; Build your own opinions from an educated foundation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Creative&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t one of Huxley&rsquo;s criteria for identifying the &ldquo;best&rdquo; foundry. I was responding to Frode&rsquo;s &ldquo;Technical, sure. Creative … umph.&rdquo; comment. Microsoft branded fonts, and the licensed fonts will never have the appeal of a boutique foundry&rsquo;s offerings, not because it&rsquo;s all utilitarian (Gabriola being a good example of a visually and technically creative typeface) but because of near-instant over-use by 500,000,000 users.</p>
