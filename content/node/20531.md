  interested in all kinds of things that have an 1800's look. Any links to resources

    books from dover publications that are full of these things. \"old-school\" clip
    art for new \"hip\" designers. \r\n\r\ndammit i hate that drop shadow and the
    type seems so forced on the banner. seems to be the current plague of bad design...give
    me retro and slap some type on it. the imagery will carry you through like an
    old trusty horse.\r\n\r\np.s. shoot that horse.\r\n\r\nw|m"

    else is in it?\r\n\r\nI've been looking at banners recently. Mostly I look at
    t-shirts to find good ones. I've only seen a few good ones in logos."

  body: "<em>fontplayer how do you like that one? What else is in it?</em>\r\n\r\nI
    love it. A lot of the book is lettering and decorative initials, but there are
    some real nice flourishes, ornaments, ribbons, banners, borders, etc.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    here recently got it for about $15-$20 used by googling it."
