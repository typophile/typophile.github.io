    guessing Charlie was too."

    body: Tiki Surf is close... thought it may have been a House Industries font.
      Thanks!

    there's a font similar to Chocolate factory but I can't dig it up right now.\r\nOh
    yes - it's Shag Lounge\r\n\r\nActually, Charlie looks like Shag Exotica. Maybe
    they customized both those fonts for the logo."

  body: That's fine for the hand-lettered, customized movie logos, but they're ripping
    off some commercial fonts on that site.

    get as those are crap versions. You want the real deal, hire Jill. '
