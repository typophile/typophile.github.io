  been looking for something to digitize and distribute online to promote the collection
  and that would also just be cool for people to have/have access to. I came across
  a specimen book for Peignot that was printed in an edition of 50, one for this collection
  specifically. I was wondering if anyone had any information on the copyright of
  this document? I'm attaching what I think to be the colophon, and title page. After
  running it through Google Translate it seems to not contain the information, as
  an American, I usually think of defining a copyright.\r\n\r\nIs it legal for me
  to scan this document and put it online? Does anyone know who I could contact to
  get permission or find out?\r\n\r\nAlso, is this something people would be interested
  in seeing? As Peignot is available as a digital font it seems like this might not
  be as compelling as some of the other stuff in their collection. However, it does
  seem kind of unique because of the low print run, and it's really nice to see in
  person (which I know is sort of contradictory to digitizing it, but maybe it would
  compel people to visit). Is there anything else people could recommend looking for
  in that collection that may be of more interest to people? There's some 20th century
  stuff, but I think the bulk of the collection is 19th and 18th century \u2013\_which
  may be more uncommon?  The collection is pretty extensive, and I'm not too familiar
  with typographic history, especially stuff that hasn't been digitized. Any advice
  on the matter and how to approach the collection is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks."

      Herb, Yes, a copy of the book, not digitizing the typeface as a font.\r\n\r\nThanks

    in the States (California's still one of 'em), digitizing the typeface to make
    fonts would be perfectly legal, even if the drawings had been done yesterday.
    Digitizing the book, on the other hand, would be a copyright issue. I believe
    heirs can maintain copyright, for a while. You'd need to check."

    longer true, unfortunately, due to Mickey Mouse. (Insert usual disclaimer that
    you really need to ask a lawyer, not us.) The copyright term in France is life
    of author plus 70 years (this probably counts as a corporate work by D&P, so it
    has probably been public domain in France after 2007), but the peculiarities of
    (1) how the US applies copyright law to foreign works and (2) the Mickey Mouse
    extensions to copyright term in the US mean that because it was published after
    1926, it won't be public domain in the United States before 2032:\r\n[[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm]]"

    now? I think I used to know back when I was researching a Deberny font from the
    turn of the century, but now I can't remember. Anyway it should be possible to
    get their permission, since it's a worthy project (at least I think so).\r\n\r\nBTW
    if you're really serious you could produce (in addition to a scanned* PDF) a letterpress
    edition (of 50 copies :-) using photopolymer plates, and maybe even sell some
    copies for good money.\r\n\r\n* At least 600 dpi, please.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    until after 2037. I suppose I'll contact the now owners of D&P, which seems to
    be Monotype, and see what I can do. These copyright issues are pretty astounding
    (especially that the font wouldn't be, but the specimen book would be copyrighted!),
    judging from the general consensus I hear online and in the media, it's become
    a pretty odd and imbalanced thing at the moment. \r\n\r\n@Chris Dean I am planning
    to use a DIY Book Scanner, they seem really great and accessible.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
    has requests for other things to scan or advice on what to look out for, I'd really
    appreciate it. Thanks!"

  body: Publicly giving away a reproduction of the whole specimen book without permission,
    assuming it is still in copyright, is almost certainly not fair use. The case
    law is really not fuzzy at all on nontransformative use of whole works that the
    copyright holder could potentially sell (even if they are not currently attempting
    to). I would certainly not attempt it without consulting an attorney.
