  ornamental penmanship as\r\ntaught by Charles Paxton Zaner at his art college at
  the turn of the 20th\r\ncentury. The Zaner font set includes four unique fonts that
  complement the\r\nother fonts in the set. Each font is available in PostScript and
  TrueType\r\nformats as well as OpenType which offers even more characters, options
  and\r\noverall functionality. Set options include PostScript and TrueType with a\r\nbonus
  set of extras and a \"super\" pro set containing over 3,000 characters.\r\nZaner
  is perfect for wedding invitations and documents that require a touch\r\nof elegance.\"\r\n\r\n<http://www.p22.com/ihof/zanerset.html>http://www.p22.com/ihof/zanerset.html\r\n"
