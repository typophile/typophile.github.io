  body: "russ-\r\nif i could offer a suggestion...? please try not to start a new
    thread every time you have another go at the logo. for one thing, it's cumbersome
    to wade through all the threads to piece together how the discourse have come
    along, for another, i think it makes the comments you've received so far seem
    irrelevent to you, as if you're throwing them out and starting over. i don't think
    that's what you're doing, but it could give that impression."

    versions of the logo to the same thread!! I'll get someone more teccie to show
    me in the office. The comments so far have been really useful - I'll try to strike
    up more of a dialogue in future! "
