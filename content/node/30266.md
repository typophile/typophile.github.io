  body: "Those are good alternatives Lari. I might also suggest Mark Simonson's <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/goldenbook/light/\">'Goldenbook
    Light'</a> for a more professional look, and which includes a lower case. For
    a hand-drawn look, how about Ronna Penner's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/garden-party/\">Garden
    Party</a>? If you want something more chaotic looking, there's <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=296467\">New
    Gothic Light</a> from Agfa. \r\n\r\nThe best method would be to draw the letters
    by hand, and/or create your own font, if this is something you will use more than
    once.\r\n- Mike Yanega"
