body: "I need to identify this font for a client and have been struggling for quite
  some time now. The trick with this one is that it seems to be custom in that the
  serifs are cut off on one side throughout the title. \r\n\r\nI'm also pretty sure
  that the R's are custom on the ends. The thicker end of the large A and the pointed
  bottom right corner of the N's could be tell tale signs?\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.dailyfreegames.com/wallpaperfiles/size2/Rise_of_the_argonauts_wallpaper01_1024x768.jpg|Here's

    font\r\n\r\n[[http://shop.guess.com/|See Here]]\r\n\r\nI bet it's the same! Maybe
    the GUESS clothing font can be a better help for figuring this one out!!\r\n\r\n"

  body: That would make sense. If I remember correctly, the Guess logo too was set
    using Times.
