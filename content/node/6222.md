  <BR> <BR>Matha, I&#39;ve no idea who or what you are, so you&#39;re as good as anonymous
  to me. My anonymity? See the Univers thread, forced upon me. But I don&#39;t think
  people would spend too long guessing my ID - I&#39;m not hiding anything. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
  you&#39;ll have the grace to call me a liar to my face some time, as I circumnavigate

    your complaint seems to have been made over and over again, and if you&#39;re
    going to dwell on it further, I suggest you start with ideas on how to fix it
    now as you move forward, rather than how it &#34;should have been&#34; done.

  body: '<i>Come on, by the middle of Saturday you could have had a strong idea how
    many extra books you&#39;d be left with...</i> <BR> <BR>Hrant, if you really think
    anyone was worrying about what to do with the stack of books <i>or even looking
    at them</i> on Saturday during the conference, you&#39;ve obviously never worked
    in those kind of conditions. The conference team has to spend a huge amount of
    energy simply to stay on top of all the aspects of the conference that have been
    planned for, to keep everything running smoothly. They do not have time to come
    up with creative solutions to every unforseen circumstance, although they must
    handle many unexpected things; their priority must always be to concentrate on
    the steady operation of the conference as planned. <BR> <BR>By the way, by Sunday
    morning a lot of people who had received tokens for the book had not picked up
    their copy yet, because they were waiting until the last minute so they would
    not have to carry it around. I doubt very much if anyone on the team was keeping
    a tally of the books: it wasn&#39;t a priority. As to giving the books away: it
    would have cost ATypI a lot of money to ship them back to England, and then what
    should have been done with them? They would still be sitting in Sharon Moncur&#39;s
    office, waiting for the additional expense of moving them somewhere from where
    they <i>might</i> be sold and some money might filter back to the association.
    <BR> <BR>Finally &#40;and I mean finally, because this is a bloody silly conversation&#41;,
    let me recount another circumstance of the conference. I produced 150 copies of
    a software CD to be distributed to attendees of the Font Technology Forum. I guessed
    we would have a max of 100 attendees, but I didn&#39;t want to run the risk of
    not having enough. I paid to have the CDs produced and to have them shipped to
    Rome. In the end, I had about 60 left over, which were handed back to me by the
    conference team on the Sunday afternoon. What did I do? I wandered around and
    handed them out to anyone who happened to be in the lobby. Now, I&#39;m sure there
    are some people who would have liked a copy who didn&#39;t get one, and there
    are some people I would have liked to give one to whom I didn&#39;t see in the
    lobby at that time. If I&#39;d thought about the CDs at any time after the Thursday
    afternoon, I would have realised that there were extra copies that could be handed
    out to &#39;deserving&#39; people. Frankly, the CDs were the last thing on my
    mind. <BR> <BR>If I had been one of the people who carried away an armful of books
    to save them from an ignominious fate, I would glady send a copy to anyone who
    did not receive one in Rome who was willing to pay postage. As it is, I only have
    one extra copy, but I&#39;ll send it to Matha if he shuts up about it.'

    In addition to avoiding the cost of shipping, the organisers also needed to close
    down the conference and get all their stuff out of the venue that Sunday afternoon.
    You want to try organising shipment of all those books at short notice on a Sunday
    afternoon in Rome? <BR> <BR>As I said, this is a silly conversation, about an
    unfortunate situation that arose because <i>not enough people came to the conference</i>.
    The organisers made a judgement call on getting rid of the surplus books as quickly

    <BR>I took it that you didn&#39;t dispute John&#39;s explanation so therefore
    believed that your complaint was that the administration of books should be completed
    to a higher standard? <BR> <BR>Is that not correct? What piece of the above is
    &#34;made up&#34;? <BR> <BR>If I&#39;ve got it wrong please let me know - and
    please let me know what your complaint is, exactly. <BR> <BR>&#62;While I&#39;m
    sure you&#39;ll understand that I don&#39;t believe you. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure
    you&#39;ll understand I find it difficult to follow your rationale. Perhaps someone
    less feeble brained than myself could explain it to me. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#34;Outrage&#34;
    is a huge exageration. <BR> <BR>Certainly is, <b>&#60;big&#62;huge&#60;/big&#62;</b>.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; just try it. <BR> <BR>Seems somewhat contrary to having volunteered
    - and besides, I&#39;m not doing the organising. <BR> <BR>&#62;Just ask John,
    eh? <BR> <BR>I thought you knew.'

    great question. I&#39;ll ask on the ATypI list right now. One clarification please:
    would Typophile be willing to pay for the shipping? BTW, I think you should do
    a members-only contest for any copies you might get. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    willing to pay it, sure. And I think your idea of a members-only contest to give
    away any book&#40;s&#41; we receive is great. Let&#39;s do it.

  body: Kudos to ATypI for adding this special membership level, and making it happen
    so quickly. We should all strive to make this a truly global community; I think
    we&#39;re making great strides. <BR> <BR>Based on Hrant&#39;s post, which has
    a delightful air of challenge, I will point out that <a href="http://www.typesociety.org/">SOTA</a>
    has a history of offering inexpensive membership fees and conference admission.
    <BR> <BR>SOTA already offers a reduced membership fee of $35USD per year for all
    members residing outside North America. This membership level is deemed Global
    Professional, and carries the exact same benefits as the regular Professional
    membership level &#40;which is $60USD&#41;. <BR> <BR>The annual SOTA conference,
    TypeCon, is already priced so low that I don&#39;t know how it could go any lower,
    unless SOTA were awarded some outrageous endowment &#40;not that we&#39;re not
    trying!&#41;. Registration is under $150USD for professionals, and less than $100USD
    for students. When we announce the exact admission fees for <a href="http://www.typecon2003.com/">TypeCon2003</a>
    in a few weeks, I think people will be pleasantly surprised. SOTA members receive
    a 20% discount off conference admission. Speakers and volunteers get in free.
    <BR> <BR>For the price of conference admission, TypeCon2003 includes 3 days of
    programming &#40;accompanied by refreshments; ask Ray Larabie about the cookies&#41;,
    free admission to some very cool evening events, and more of the good things you
    expect from an event produced by our community.  <BR> <BR>If anyone wants to discuss
    SOTA and TypeCon further, let&#39;s move over to the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/sota">SOTA
    SIG</a> here at Typophile. This is ATypI&#39;s thread, and they should have it
    all to themselves.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
