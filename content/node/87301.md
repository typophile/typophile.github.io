  body: "Excellent, thanks! I emailed the designer directly and here's what he told
    me:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The typeface for \"Future\" is based on a free font I pulled
    a long time ago from dafont.com called Big Noodle Titling. I think I just shortened
    the height some by pulling the legs and bottoms of the vertical strokes up on
    the letters a bit, and the speed lines were added in later</blockquote>"
