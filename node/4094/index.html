I will not make a big family out of it, just the regular bold and black. Caps and numbers are not available yet.

I had it in my head but was not sure. With you saying that makes me sure that I have to change it. The first reaction is always the most important. <BR> <BR>&gt; the x-height is way too small; But that will change if I make the ascenders and descenders smaller. Like Ole also suggested, it will then have less negative space. <BR> <BR>&gt; and the weight is too light. Too light? Are you sure? I printed it many times in different sizes and it seems to be OK. How much darker does it have to be than? Is there something like a golden rule that I can follow? Do you have maybe a reference font that I can check up on? <BR> <BR>I'm personally not so sure about the 's'. Do you see a problem there? Another thought is that I would like to make the bowls of the 'd, p' g, q' a bit more round so that the little serifs more distinct (if that makes any sence). Or would you leave that like it is? <BR> <BR>Thanx,</div>

Only time lets my eyes, see fully again. Barring that, it's a balancing act trying to borrow other people's eyes, but keeping my concept. The same is true of trying to write a paper in school. As you proof your own work, you combine what you've got in your head with what's actually on paper. Your readers don't have that luxury so their eye is more critical, but less aware of what you're actually wanting to say. <BR> <BR>Don't let me drag you off concept. All my suggestions are just that. Any other typophiles want to jump in here? <BR> <BR>One final suggestion :-) Move on to the caps. Immerse in those for a while.

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. Well, the remnants of the funky modulation in the original design are hurting you. Like the &quot;O&quot; and dots on the &quot;i&quot;/&quot;j&quot; look totally out of place now, I mean in the overall picture. I think you either need to go back to the original modulation (find out why it's making you &quot;angry&quot;, and deal with it) or totally get rid of it. I guess you could alternatively make the funky modulation a very gentle presence throughout, but that will be very hard to pull off, I think. <BR> <BR>Structurally, the only glyph that really bothers me is the &quot;k&quot; - I'd make it like the UC. The &quot;C&quot; and &quot;G&quot; seem too wide. The diaresis is too strong, and I'd flatten the UC accents. Otherwise once you figure out the modulation issue you'll have a solid design on your hands I think. <BR> <BR>I think your spacing is loose. Now, if you're still going for small sizes, that's fine, in fact your vertical proportions are much better now for that; but the color will be too light then. Also, because your spacing is loose, you need a bigger blank space - and this might in fact be the problem with the all-caps setting: they're already hard to read, but with their taller height the small wordspace ruins everything. <BR> <BR>Don't give up!  :-) <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi guys, <BR> <BR>magnus, that's absolutely correct with the monogram.  <BR> <BR>hhp, what and where do some of the characters look mechanically inclined? Just to get a good feeling for what I should look out for. <BR>With my italic I just, like you could see, mechanincally inclined it. I 'italized' it here and there to get the typical italic look and feel. But in fact it is not a real italic.  <BR>Therefor the width is still the same. My spacing is a bit more tight than the Regular, but I can change that back.  <BR> <BR>I think you're right with the ampersand. I'll change it. What about keeping it in the italic? Would that work? <BR> <BR>This are the original sketches with the funky modulated typeface. I will start on that this weekend and keep you updated. I'm looking for a good name for it, so if someone has some good ideas&hellip; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53063.jpg" alt="Insider original sketch"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53064.jpg" alt="Insider original sketch 2"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53065.jpg" alt="Insider original sketch 3"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53066.jpg" alt="Insider original sketch 4"> <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Randy, <BR> <BR>Welcome back. :-) And thanks for the nice compliment. Coming from you I think that means something. <BR> <BR>Yes, it came right after Nordic. I guess you can see my handwriting. Could you recognize it as my font, not knowing that it came from me? <BR> <BR>About the funky version, I will finish it based on the sketches. I won't overwork Insider to push the modulation back in. This font will mainly work onscreen and needs no funky modulations; it's a working horse. Insider became more round over the time and the funky one needs a bit more tight curves. You can see that clearly on the sketches.  <BR> <BR>I'm really looking forward for working on the funky font. I've overcome my frustration and feel that I'm up to the challenge now. <BR>The glyphs that frustrated me most are: b, e, s (although I now kinda like it with the funky curves in). <BR> <BR>hhp, what's going on in your head? :-) I don't see it beeing the name for the font, but perhaps the sample book that I will make for it. It's a great theme where I see some interesting images. <BR> <BR>Later, <BR></div>
