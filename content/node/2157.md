    target="_blank">Porcelain</a> from <a href="http://www.misprintedtype.com/" target="_blank">Misprinted
    Type</a>. And they have a commercial version called <a href="http://www.misprintedtype.com/type/type_nars.html"
    target="_blank">Nars</a>, which I think is really nice and grungy. <BR> <BR>Other
    grungy looking scripts which I like include Article, Solace from <a href="http://www.lunchboxstudios.com"
    target="_blank">Lunchbox Studios</a>.
