  a condensed Grotesk.\r\nThis was the name on the label of the case.\r\nI'm not sure
  if its right.\r\nFor my opinion, better: feeling, there is a logical break between
  Rennaissance and a Grotesk font, isn't it?\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

    It [[http://www.google.com/search?q=Renaissance-Grotesk|seems]] to be related
    somehow to Renaissance Antiqua, which was designed by Zapf, so maybe Renaissance
    Grotesk was also designed by him.
