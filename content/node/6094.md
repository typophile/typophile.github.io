  body: Jack,  <BR> <BR>I think the font is <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=202342"
    target="_blank">Castellar</a> &#40;Monotype&#41; that has been filled in. All
    the letterforms look the same to me, especially the G, T &amp; R.

    couldn&#39;t find it with the Typophile Advanced Search, <BR>as it&#39;s buried
    amongst the big chunk of archives thaht went AWOHL <BR>a while ago. I had to search
    externally to dig this one up.

  body: Thanks Jack. That&#39;s a pretty funny-looking &#39;Font Gladiator&#39;.  <BR>
    <BR>Yves, have people been telling us that there was a way to use Google to search
    the Typophile archives? I tried using the Typophile search and Google and couldn&#39;t
    get any answers, so I sat down with the Font Book until it jumped off the page.
    The T and R were what I kept looking for.
