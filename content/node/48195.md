body: How does, say, Dom Casual end up in paint on the exterior wall of a mechanic's
  shop? Does an artist just paint from a sample? I'm guessing the bricks aren't shoved
  through a printer, but I've seen some extremely precise lettering and was curious
  if something else was going on that I've not thought of.

  body: It's probably either stenciled through a custom made vinyl mask, or outlined
    and then filled in by hand.

  body: "depends on the surface of the wall.\r\nif it was a very smooth surface, the
    lettering might not be painted, it might be cut vinyl letters. These are cut into
    adhesive colored vinyl film (using a cutter much like a CAD plotter), essentially
    making a large sticker, which is then adhered to the wall, with a backing tape
    to hold everything in position when applying.\r\n\r\nAlternately, the letter could
    be cut, by the same method as above, out of a \"mask\" vinyl, where the letters
    would be removed, the remaining mask applied to the wall, then you just apply
    paint, which only hits the exposed letters, and then remove the mask.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    you can make a \"ponce\" pattern, where the same plotter device makes a dotted
    perforation line  in a large piece of paper around the outlines of all letters.
    then the pattern is taped to the wall, chalk is used to mark the lettering through
    the pounce pattern, and the template is removed, leaving a light outlines of letter
    edges to paint on.\r\n\r\nJason C "

    printer.

  body: "During a visit at the 24 hours race of Le Mans in France, logo's on the pitwall
    were painted by hand without masks. Just a picture from which these artist painted
    them on the wall. And they did a good job!\r\nThis was done less that one day
    before the race making sure the logo's would be crisp and clean during the race."

  body: "At TypeCon Buffalo, on Paul Shaw's tour, we came across a still-functioning
    family lettering shop. There were hand-painted parking signs laying around that
    blew me away. Not because they were stunning beautiful, but because they were
    so damn consistent. Sometimes, it really is just a person who's got that touch.\r\n\r\nI'm
    very excited at the prospect of a new Epson BrickJet 100, which can do edge-to-edge
    printing on any masonry surface, and includes full mortar coverage. The cartridges
    are murder on your wallet, though."
