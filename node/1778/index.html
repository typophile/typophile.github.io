		<div class="commentbody"> thanks so much for the replies <BR> <BR>Jacques - I don&#39;t believe I fully understand what you&#39;re saying - but what I think are your ideas are interesting - I&#39;d imagine transposing the &#39;texture&#39; of this font under a different / more typical screen font could maybe lead to some surprises. <BR> <BR>the font came from a few different ideas, most prevalent was the old DOS boot-up screen font; I&#39;m pretty sure that has the same &#39;scanline&#39; look to it.  also old fonts that worked w/ dot matrix printers... anyway there&#39;s gotta be at least a few fonts like this already in existence... like rodolfo&#39;s ;&#41; <BR> <BR>found the limitations in making this font to be interesting though, which is pretty much why I made it.. I definitely agree with you stephen about the &#39;y&#39;... sticks out like a sore thumb actually <BR> <BR>again thanks very much for your comments and ideas.  it means a lot, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing :D <BR> <BR>- andrew </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andrew, make Paul Rand with his striped version <BR>of City for IBM the first of us. ;&#41;  <BR>Your face has merits, mine was an incomplete <BR>one-off affair. <BR>About the &#39;y&#39;: what&#39;s interesting is that you&#39;ve <BR>achieved almost an italic construction in letters <BR>like b, g. Quite a feat, considering the <BR>constraints. You should try to obtain the same  <BR>suppleness in other characters, like the y that&#39;s <BR>been mentioned. Just as an experiment, I&#39;ve tried <BR>two alternatives to your y: <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1948.gif" ALT="temp_ac.gif"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also fiddled with the v and the d &#40;in the word  <BR>&#39;traded&#39;&#41;. You could try to &#39;italicize&#39; more your <BR>design &#40;italicize, not slant ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Rodolfo, what about that font you used for your typographi.ca banner? &#40;V2000?&#41; It looks interesting, like it has &#42;vertical&#42; scanlines, and it&#39;s made of two fonts that combine in different colors or something... Wazzat? <BR> <BR>Hrant, that &#39;font&#39; was done in fact for print. It <BR>was a set of pseudo-bitmaps I designed to use in <BR>a poster. The idea was that odd and even &#34;vertical <BR>scanlines&#34; were differently colored - but with some <BR>&#34;pixels&#34; out of place according to letter structure <BR>&#40;in the case of the typographica banner, &#42;many&#42; <BR>pixels&#41;. This construction principle allowed different <BR>shapes to emerge. I think I have an image of the <BR>thing as it was used somewhere. If I find it, I&#39;ll <BR>post it. V2000 was a codename &#40;the poster was <BR>called &#34;Ver&atilde;o 2000&#34;, which means &#34;Summer 2000&#34;.&#41;</div>
