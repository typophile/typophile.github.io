For some other designs i need a face that's classy, simple, clean, but still has some personality. Any suggestions are welcome. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evenutally i'm hoping we'll change our body type and the type for headers and would appreciate any suggestions there as well. I took a look at fontbureau's fonts for newspapers last nite and none of them really grabbed me and that's about as far as i've researched thus far.

No matter what happens, though, i'm adamant that we sever our ties with Times and find something fresh. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I kinda like the Cheltenham (thanks for the ID) mast myself, but would like to see something with a bit more sophistication. We are, however, trying to become &quot;the paper for the people&quot; and want it to have more of a hometown feel, so i don't want to do something too far removed from the people we're trying to reach.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Paul. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will start with the familiar disclaimer that I've never designed a newspaper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some questions to ask: Is it a small town paper? Should it look like a small town paper? Do readers want it to look like a small town paper? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The implications of this are many. For example, the NYT doesn't have any advertising on the font cover. Should that be a priority? Even if there must be ads on the front page, I would lobby hard to remove them from the masthead. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the masthead: You are dealing with people who are comfortable with 3D photoshopped type, a waving american flag, a local statue (i assume), and a big 50 cent. So moving back to a purely typographic masthead may be a stretch for them. I'd definitly loose the flag. And the large 50 cent (everyone in winslow knows that). If the statue is in fact a Winslow landmark, I would consider keeping it (or some other town landmark) and using it in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Winslow (statue) Mail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> configuration. Make it an engraved or scratchboard looking illustration, not a photograph</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hey hrant, thanks again! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->yeah the ITC version of Cheltenham was what i was looking at last night. I think most our body text is set at 10pts, you think it would work at that size? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We do have some decent alternatives already (perhaps) but i'm none too keen on the intricacies of the text face (i'm more of a display type of guy) Last night i was playing with that front page and and tried using Hoefler Text, Joanna, Georgia, Garamond, Galiard, Goudy just to see how these faces would look. Georgia is a personal favorite of mine (and it's based off of Miller isn't it?) But the rest i didn't really feal comfortable with, except maybe Hoefler Text. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About the ads&hellip; i totally agree that they should go below the nameplate,  personally i would like to see no ads above the fold, but i don't know what the advertiser's contract is. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About the statue.. his name's &quot;Easy&quot; from the Eagle's song &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and the one line that says &quot;I was standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona&hellip;&quot; I was wanting to make him more graphic instead of having a photo of him, but again, my publisher doesn't want to see him in the nameplate (because of local politics, you know how it goes in a small town) But i may still do one mock up with him in there.  Alternatively other graphic elements I could use are the railroad or perhaps Route 66.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just for fun i'll upload a few more nameplates that i found while digging through our archives.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My publsiher liked this blackletter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i like the nostalgic feel of this one, although i'm not sure whether the train station is the heart of the city (maybe i should stick the local Wal-Mart in there instead, LOL) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple rail inspired motifs. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh and i forgot to mention, Winslow is on the border of the Navajo reservation and we're trying to appeal to that audience as well, however i don't really wanna see an overtly southwestern/native design scheme. keep the comments coming, i'm getting some good ideas!</div>

The 'Readibility' series - 9 different fonts each with a range of weights - is specifically for newspapers, and something designed to purpose is probably going to end up looking a lot better. They have a PDF of it you can download it and print it out, and have the phone number for this on their site. I'm sure they can clue you in on what will work for your paper stock, press, budget, etc.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Gerard Unger stuff is also a great idea, and designed and proven for newspapers.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, here's some free amateur opinion, probably worth what it costs, based on your PDF of the front page.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think fonts are your main problem. Times New Roman was eventually changed by the Times itself, but it a very good face, if your paper is not too rough. (The sharp points on the serifs melt if the paper is not good enough, I understand.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect you can make the paper look a lot better even with Times as the body text. First, I would look at how the Times (of London) itself used to use it for a clue. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect that you have too much leading in the body text, and that tightening it would make give the paper more even 'color' and a more professional look. (Also, your font size may be too big for the narrow columns.) Second, Times bold isn't the best as a headline font, but if you use it, I suspect it should be tracked negatively for large headlines, so you get a bolder, more punchy look. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, all the centered text in the blue box on the left is a definite no-no, as it is way less readable, and there should never be over a few lines centered.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would think that with a new masthead and headline font, and improvement of the typography, you could make the whole thing look quite good, even with Times.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another more radical revision to think about is having fewer columns. I believe the NYT has the six columns. Narrow columns as less desirable from the point of view of readability, but that way NYT can start a lot of stories on the front page, with headlines - in the narrow, tall Cheltenham. However, you have your headlines going across a number of columns, so that the many columns doesn't particularly help you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I said, I am just blathering about this stuff without knowledge, but anyway these are the kinds of questions you can ask about revising your present design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Society for Newspaper Design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and on their site they have a searchable list of books on newspaper design, including books of award winning designs. If you call them they can probably tell you of a whole division of small town weeklies, and you can talk to your colleagues who are in a similar situation, and get practical, valuable advice.</div>

So don't conclude that ITC Cheltenham is too dark based on a comparison with Times, or seen at 24 point, or from laser prints (which make type darker). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I can't believe I'm defending that monstrosity!

		<div class="commentbody">Paul one more thought, in any publishing business the editors know how many words they need to fill a certain amount of space. So your editor has a feel for managing the writers telling them to write to a certain number of words. If you change the text face make sure the characters per pica is almost exactly the same as Times or you might get some resistance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, good point. And Times isn't easy to beat. In fact the best way to beat it is to use a WIDER font with a bigger x-height, so you can set it smaller and with less -total- leading. The CPP will be worse than Times for a give point size, but the overall surface area used by the other font in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->small<!-- raw HTML omitted --> point size will be less (without losing on apparent size), at least for news text (which has a lot of linebreaks - which negates the space savings of narrow designs like Times). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, check out these: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, so as not to hijack Ben's post, I'll put my response here. Yer quite right about Whitman &amp; Bliss as a good alternative to Joanna &amp; Gill Sans. I see a strong resemblance between these pairs, but it looks like your face is much less &quot;horsey&quot; than Joanna. You brought Whitman up earlier in this post of mine, and i'm just curious as to why you don't think it'd work for newspaper (I'm still trying to learn what makes a good paper text face and what doesn't, so some commentary would be enlightening). I'll hafta remember Whitman for future projects tho. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh and so's ya'll know&hellip; We had a corporate shake up th'other week and I kept my job, yay! In a month or so I'll be doing all the layout and design for the Winslow Mail (scary huh?) Now that I've got the name plate slapped on there I'm gonna start pushing for better text fonts. I'd really like to use Miller and am putting some pressure on my new publisher to make it happen for me. Last week I used Folio Bold condensed for our main story's headline, but I'm not sure that that's exactly what I want for that type of thing. Another Headline font I'd like to get is Azuza by Parkinson <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://typedesign.com/fonts/azuzam.html">http://typedesign.com/fonts/azuzam.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what does everybody think of this combo: Miller for text, Azuza for headlines and (Your Suggestions Go Here) for a good, solid, sans for main headlines. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P.S. Anyone know of any good books that deal with newspaper design (I checked out your link, William, but it gave me too many suggestions for books, i'd like to have 2-5 good recommendations to look at) I picked up a copy of The Essentials of Typographic Design, but I haven't gotten that far into the book to know if it'll help me (directly) in this area. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyhow, thnx again for listening!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding Whitman and newspapers: Hrant pretty much summed it up. The proportions are all wrong. Too much of the body is given over to the ascenders and descenders. This is primarily what marks it as a book typeface. There are also a few technical considerations, like various details which would become ink traps on newsprint. I don't necessarily agree with Hrant about the wider and looser part (but that's a legitimate debate). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Advice that I received recently on this very topic: &quot;My advice about newspaper types is that to remember they are set in very narrow columns.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Patria is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->still<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not ready for full release. :-/ I know what I need to fix, but it needs to be one big push (just like the first iteration was back when) so I need to be able to allocate a big enough block of undisturbed time. The biggest problem in the current version is the serif structure in the caps. Even so, I actually sold a copy last year to somebody who used it to superb effect: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/SGS.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/SGS.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Paired with Carter's Mantinia.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is one reason I'd offer a trial scheme (basically because I'd like to have actual newsprint of it in action), but since it would be a &quot;one-off&quot; deal I'd rather not discuss it in public.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, all i can say is good luck. It's a fun process but a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tricky one as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looks like you've made good progress so far Paul. I can't  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->give you anymore advice on type that the experts here  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->haven't already said. But a few resources for you to check <!-- raw HTML omitted -->out in consideration to newspaper design. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NewspageDesigner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is wonderful. Get to see what other news and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->magazine designers are putting out around the country.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Easily the best resource out there for people dealing with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->newspaper design. I would also recomend &quot;Seeing the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Newspaper&quot; by Kevin Barnhurst. I have just started reading  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it and it has some good tips/ideas. It was recomended to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me by a newspaper man (photographer, designer,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->journalist) with 35+ years of experience in the business. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't say it enough, but just look at other newspapers. Find <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ones that you like and enjoy then follow them for a while.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some of my favorites, as far as design go, are the Orange County <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Register, Hartford Courant, Seatle Post Intelligencer, Wisonsin <!-- raw HTML omitted -->State Journal just to mention a few. If you need more, I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about another dozen i could give you to look at. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and i forgot. Check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mario Garcia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Some people think  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his stuff has become a bit too similar in newspaper design of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->late, but many people still bow down before him. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hope some of these suggestions help. Good luck and remember <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to have fun.</div>
