  what font the logo is in? Before anyone preempts me, I think it may be a a typeface
  since the S&#39;s are the same, and there&#39;s some other type on the <a href="http://www.subpop.com/bands/shins_release/"
  target="_blank">cover</a> of their new CD that seems to be from the same face. The

  body: Well, there have been some interesting developments. <BR> <BR>Okay, here&#39;s
    the good news. It is &#40;or was&#41; a typeface. The bad news. It may not be
    digital.  <BR> <BR>Excitingly&#42;, a colleague of mine found out from the designer
    &#40;the actual one&#41; that it was based on a woodcut type found in a Dover
    catalog &#40;he&#39;s not sure which one&#41; called &#34;Gothic Bold.&#34; If
    ever there was a more ubiquitous name for a typeface. Unfortunately, that&#39;s
    all we know.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone know if a facsimile exists in digital form
    or if it goes by a different name?    <BR> <BR>&#42;Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s
    a word either <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: 'Does anyone perhance have this Dover woodtype catalog? I&#39;d really like
    to see what the full character set looked like. Also, I have to make a correction
    to my earlier post, apparently it&#39;s called Gothic Book, not Gothic Bold, not
    that makes it any more unique <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    on &#34;Box Gothic&#34; at PrecisionType. It appears that <BR>Alphabets, Inc.
    digitized this typeface under that name. <BR> <BR>You can use the Type &amp; View
    function to check.

    <BR>That&#39;s twice you&#39;ve come through for me Mike. First with the Topic
    suggestion and now with this. How did you find Box Gothic from Alphabets without
    even a name to go on? Very Impressive. <BR> <BR>Yeah, that W is hideous. I must
    concur.  '

  body: I almost weep when I visit Precision Type. They&#39;ve got lots of fonts,
    many from arcane foundries, that can be found nowhere else. But they sit in their
    back alley of the Web with an outdated, user-unfriendly site, largely unknown
    and ignored. They&#39;ve only themselves to blame. <BR> <BR>Same goes for <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html"
    target="_blank">Castcraft/Opti</a>. Even more so IMO.
