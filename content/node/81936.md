  know this is not a real font editor but it was adapted to my project.\r\nNow I have
  kerning trouble.\r\n\r\nFontstruct exports only .ttf format, what is the best way
  / software to adjust the letter spacing ?"

  body: "FontForge, Fontographer and FontLab are the most obvious choices but there
    are other font editing tools available. DTL has a range of font editing tools
    that can be purchased separately if only specific functions are required. If you
    are working on a Mac then you could consider the Glyphs application developed
    by, Georg Seifert which is free in its current beta release. There is also the
    HighLogic Font Creator application which only runs on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe [[Font
    Editors]] section of the Typowiki will also lead you to additional information
    on these and other products."

    it's very easy using Font Creator but I can`t buy it now. I visited many websites
    through Google to download the programm free but it didn't work.\r\n\r\nI'm very
    knew creating fonts but very eager to learn how to do it.\r\n\r\nPlease, let me
    know if there's any free programm I can download to my computer.\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot.\r\n"

    There are a few others, but I can't remember their names.
