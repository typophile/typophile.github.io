  would you recommend? Thanks for any info/insights\r\n\r\nStephanie"

    company or color house (separator) that you most do business with (and trust,
    of course).\r\n\r\nYou might as well set up a companion balanced color viewing
    station to match your favorite vendor. That way you see what they see. It also
    makes it possible to do remote color correction conferences as well.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

    Also there is the whole issue on how color prints based on different printing
    systems, like sheet fed vs web and these days even waterless. '

  body: "Thanks very much to all for this information. The unfortunate fact is, we
    don't really have a trusted print house to turn to for advice largely because
    it's only recently that we've begun doing a significant amount of print. Moreover
    we haven't had a lot of luck with the vendors we've been using of late--some quality
    and service issues. So I have to turn to other avenues for insight I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nGood
    point about the monitor calibration software; we do have a PANTONE set up for
    that so I'll keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nThanks again! I really appreciate having
    this web site to turn to for stuff like this. I am letting as many people know
    about it as I can.\r\n\r\nStephanie"
