  body: "It seems easy enough to find things that are similar, but I have not been
    able to find the exact font. It may be custom, as this would be an easy style
    to make.\r\n\r\nSome alternatives I have located so far: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tailspinstudio/softie/\">Softie</a>,

    still looking, but I wonder if this is just not a commercial font.\r\n\r\n- Mike
