  the lettering from butter labels for a while, and I finally found the one I was
  looking for. I've seen the lettering for 'BUTTER' on other grocer house butters,
  and I just realized it was originally Darigold. Wondering from the type experts
  around here if this is a custom face (i'm assuming) or if this is derived from anything
  else. I'd like to create an alphabet from the lettering on the pre-80s packages,
  I think it's wonderful.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMore on Darigold labels:\r\nhttp://www.darigold.com/butterlabels.asp"

    looks like the same lettering was used on numerous Darigold packaging back in
    the day. Maybe this brand is just a NW thing, I might take a drive out to Yakima
    (2hrs east of Seattle) to see the cheese factory and investigate."
