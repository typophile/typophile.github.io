body: I&#39;ve been looking at various boldface fonts and notice that almost all of
  them have numerals and math signs with the same width as the corresponding characters
  in the regular font--but a couple of high quality fonts I looked at have wider numerals.  I
  assume this consistency of numeral widths is done so that the numerals will line
  up if they are used in a table where bold and roman are mixed.  Any other reason?  Is
  the consistency of width an expected practice?  In the bold font I&#39;m working
  on, I&#39;m concerned that putting all the extra width on the inside of the &#34;8&#34;
  will make the counters too closed up at small point sizes, and so am leaning towards
  making the numeral widths slightly different between the bold and regular fonts.
  <BR> <BR>I also assume that there need not be such consistency when dealing with
  old style numerals, since these are supposed to blend well into a line of letters;
  letting them be shaped as they look best would seem the way to go. &#40;If the shapes
  and sidebearings could easily be made consistent, no harm in that of course.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Any suggestions appreciated. <BR>David

  body: We set old-style numbers in tables fairly often. For Type 1 fonts, we make
    up tabular and &#34;proportional&#34; numbers, both os &amp; lining,. All glyphs
    in a font &#40;e.g., &#34;roman&#34;&#41; are put in one font &amp; we write an
    encoding vector to get what we need. If you&#39;re using QuarkMaker, that won&#39;t
    work, but I believe some people like Sumner Stone have made up multiple fonts
    having different figure styles &amp; setwidths. <BR> <BR>For OpenType, the problem
    dissappears, you can have both tabular and proportional, oldstyle and lining in
    a single font. <BR> <BR>When you have to set a table &amp; bold is called for,
    it&#39;s mandatory that the bold have the same setwidth as the roman &amp; italic
    -- otherwise the proof will come back marked &#34;P.E. Align on decimal.&#34;
