body: "I developed some python script programs in FL.\r\n\r\nthe module is for TTF
  hinting and is like below.\r\n\r\n1. auto-hinting in FL(differs from FL generating
  auto-Hinting)\r\n2. copy & paste of FL hinting instructions(by searching similar
  pattern)\r\n3. export FL hinting to VTT(except 'double link' instructions;;)\r\n4.
  import VTT hinting to FL(convertable instructions only;;)\r\n\r\nfor Korean Hangul,
  module #1, #2 is very useful.\r\nmodule #3, #4 is good for semi-autoHinted fonts
  for VTT.\r\nespecially #2 reduces working time by 50 ~ 70% of whole hinting work.(lots
  of Hangul designers agree with that.)\r\nI think it is due to similarities of lots
  of consonants(elements) in hangul glyphs.\r\nusually, hangul fonts have more than
  2350(sometimes 11172) hangul glyphs.\r\n\r\nBut, I don't know whether it is useful
  for English or other fonts..\r\nis it useful for usual hinting for FL hinting?\r\nif
  so, is it worth selling?\r\n\r\nhow do you think??"

  body: "When we build OpenType Korean fonts, which are CID-keyed, we calculate hinting
    parameters on a per hint dictionary basis. Specifically, all of the glyphs are
    used in the calculation, which is done by post-processing the output of the AFDKO
    \"stemHist\" tool.\r\n\r\nHint dictionaries are assigned based on glyph class.
    The largest hint dictionary in our Korean fonts is for the glyphs for the 11,172
    hangul. We apply the same stem width parameters to all of these glyphs through
    the use of rather simple techniques. One is to simply edit the hinting parameters
    in the appropriate hint dictionaries of the CIDFont resource, then run the AFDKO
    \"autohint\" tool to apply the hinting parameters to the glyphs.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    what you are describing is done within the context of FontLab Studio."

    already mentioned 'VTT' and it means it was for TTF.\r\n\r\nOf course, I already

    need to develop it.\r\nanyway, thank you for your comments~"

    Hinting between weights of a font?\r\n\r\nHow does the VTT<>FL work? Is the VTT
    hinting scheme public?"

  body: "<em>export FL hinting to VTT(except 'double link' instructions)</em>\r\n\r\nWe've
    also developed FL-to-VTT conversion tools, but we took a slightly different approach:
    we convert FL <em>PostScript</em> stem hints to VTT visual links, rather than
    FL TTF hinting, because of the mismatch between FL and VTT TTF hint representation."

  body: "If it has similar pattern, it can be done well I think.\r\nI didn't think
    of pasting in different weight. :-)\r\nBut I think it will be okay, too.\r\n\r\nVTT
    <-> FL isn't suitable for those who wants the same result between FL and VTT.\r\nIn
    fact, it is only for VTT work, not for FL work.\r\nI thought the process like
    below for VTT users.\r\n1)auto-hint -> ( 2)copy & paste ) -> 3)export to VTT ->
    4)detailed work in VTT -> 5)import to FL -> 6)copy & paste the result of process
    #4 -> 7)export to VTT -> 8) detailed work which isn't supported by FL\r\n\r\nthis
    is more detailed explanations about the program\r\n<strong>1. auto-hinting in
    FL</strong>\r\n- do auto-hinting in FL\r\n- almost similar algorithm with FL,
    I think\r\n- little bit better than that of FL I think(but, it takes so long time
    : for hangul 6,400 glyphs, it takes almost 10 minutes)\r\n- now update and debug
    is proceeding\r\n\r\n<strong>2. copy & paste of FL hinting instructions</strong>\r\n-
    copy and paste(include delete) some instructions\r\n- search similar pattern with
    each node's pattern\r\n- uses pywin32 extension for clipboard copy(for saving
    'copy' glyph's index, nodes' index)\r\n- some search option needs to be set(there
    can be default option, too)\r\n\r\n<strong>3. export FL hinting to VTT</strong>\r\n-
    exports link, interpolate, delta, align to VTT(vtttalk)\r\n- stem width, stem
    height, zone values are exported to cvt program\r\n- due to prep, fpgm setting,
    the result can't be the same\r\n- double link can't be exported (I think it can
    cause more 'delta' instructions, so I don't make, export it at all)\r\n- easy
    work in VTT(auto hinting -> export => semi-autohinting for VTT)\r\n- with function
    #2, #4, it can be very useful for VTT\r\n \r\n<strong>4. import VTT hinting to
    FL</strong>\r\n- VTT hinting can be much easier than before with function #2,
    #3 like below process\r\n => export FL hinting -> do minute manual hinting with
    importable instructions -> import VTT hinting -> copy & paste -> export\r\n- only
    single link, interpolate, align, middle delta, final delta can be imported\r\n
    => minimum distance, delta size(not x/8, but x/16, x/32, x/64), can be imported
    to g.note as a string\r\n- due to prep, fpgm setting, the result can't be the
    same between FL and VTT\r\n- cvt, zone values can't be imported(manual input,
    but if the values are the same, it needs no manual input)\r\n- other instructions
    can't be imported(in fact, it can be imported as a string, but I think it's not
    so good way)"
