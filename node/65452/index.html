  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, long time lurker.

What do you guys think of the logo attached? My old logo was good but I felt it didn't represent me and my brother properly so I've re-designed a completely new one.

I wanted something simple, to the point and typographic. There are two people involved with the portfolio and the split in the middle O represents this. I've kerned it as best I could but sometimes you just need fresh eyes to make sure every things proper and my brains numb from thinking of ways I could improve it.

		<div class="commentbody">I like the idea of the two "half-names" meeting in the "O" – a whole made up of two halves, very fitting. And it looks yummy. But –and maybe this is just me– conceptually I find the "cracked" "O" a bit disturbing. It can easily read as a perfect whole (that circular "O") being broken/split, and not quite fitting together.

Have you tried other treatments without the offset in the "O", but with different treatments of the two "halves"? Like, dunno, having "MAS + half an O" black on white, and the other half of the wordmark reversed out of black? Or maybe try using two different fonts (for your different personalities) that would however smoothly "fuse" in the "O"? Like maybe a sans and a slab that share the same proportions.
That way the "O" could become an image for your common, shared "focus", rather than the fault line between two slightly incompatible parts.

Just my $.02. I don't think it <em>doesn't</em> work – I just wonder if it's the solution that best communicates what you need it to communicate.</div>

Have you tried cutting the O at a different angle to match what's already in the letters ? I mean this:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/masonio_4582.png]

The ying/yang version is very nice too, I'd try hollowing out the red part instead of painting it differently, see if that's any good. Or even removing it altogether, the O should still remain legible.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, that's cool.
I was reminded of Herb Lubalin's «Mother and Child» thing (see <a href="http://www.logodesignlove.com/images/simple-logos/mother-and-child-logo.gif">here</a>), but I don't think that has to be a problem. In any case it's much more «one whole» now, rather than two halves.
I'd maybe try making the ampersand a bit larger and/or bolder, so that it works even better doubling as the counterspace.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The website, to me, feels a tad busy and flashy for something that's intended to be of clean, simple and print qualities. The gradient immediately takes me away from any sort of association with printed matter. 

Additionally, all the multicolored text elements (especially the twitter section), pictures, and subheads grab for my attention. Your hierarchy of elements on the page needs to be explored further.

You're not far off, but you're not quite there yet either.

I see a few things that might benefit from some tweaking:

-the body text for each of the posts is red . . . all of the text everywhere is red. It might work better if the body text was a grey, or whatever one of your secondary colors is, to set it apart further from the headline.
 
-that twitter section is a bit heavy. I don't really want to go over and read through that chunk of text. I would put only the most recent 'tweet' over there and then let people click through to your twitter page if they'd like to read more. Either that, or give each post more white space.
 
-Something about the logo has been bothering me, and I think it's because of the drop shadow you have on it. What would it look like without that?
