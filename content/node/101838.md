body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a type project that requires some opentype
  knowledge that I lack.\r\n\r\nI would like to create a font that use contextual
  alternates to swap glyphs based on there occurence in the text. \r\n\r\nTherefore
  the font would have to \"count\" the number of time a letter appear in the text
  and switch it if need be. \r\nFor exemple I'd like to be able to set an opentype
  feature that would swap the 25th \"a\" and 3rd \"b\" of the text with an alternative
  \"a'' and \"b\".  I'd like the font to be able to evolve depending on the content
  used and select additional letters based on the number of time that letter was used.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a way to do something like that ? \r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to font creation
  and open type features but I have some basic knowledge of Glyphs and Robotfont.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles"

    to achieve this. "
