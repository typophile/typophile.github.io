  body: One of those Veer scripts Tiffany might have meant could be <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000006"
    target="_blank">Gizmo</a> by Nick Cooke of G-Type. It has a similar overloaded
    brush script style.  <BR> <BR>Also T-26&#39;s <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=352"
    target="_blank">Lassigue D&#39;Amato</a> by Jim Marcus has a lot of grunge-scriptiness
    about it.
