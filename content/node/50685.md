  led to this beautiful PDF, which you can find in jpg format on the IAMPETH website.
  <a href=\"http://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis_pen_art/dennis_pen_art_page19.html\">This
  page</a> makes me think that the names penned are illustrations of different pen
  styles, probably American. Does anyone care to provide any more information or divulge
  where i can read more about the various styles?"
