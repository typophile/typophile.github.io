		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. What's up with Bembo lately?

I've printed several letterpress books with Bembo. I'd like to think they were well printed. Never had a problem with the face except for those related to its metal configuration. It was weak as a metal face in that thin crossbars such as those in the lowercase e would wear out quickly. But then again, Monotype was never meant to be edition printed so why complain.

Unattractive or uncomfortable? What are you kidding? Ever see Mrs Eaves?

I try not to be doctrinaire about fonts because they can be so wrong or so right depending on their use. Not that there aren't fonts I will NEVER use (Bookman! anything ITC!). But I do try to keep an open mind. 

I for one am sick to death of all the new grotesks, DIN and it's ilk. And publishers like Phaidon who use unreadable fonts for running text thinking it's edgy and cool. </div>

Well, maybe not complete agreement. I have never liked Palatino and I am sure Zapf qualifies as "revered" by most Typophilers.  Yes, we are an opinionated bunch though:-)

		<div class="commentbody">I'm very partial to letterpress Bembo in the context of British commercial printing of the 1930s to 1960s, especially academic books. I've never been very impressed with Bembo in private press and limited edition printing (even when printed by Mardersteig), where the larger sizes are usually used. Bembo is a great commercial bookface, but is somehow too common for the special treatment of fancy papers and bindings. But give me a copy of any OUP scholarly work set in Bembo and its the typographic equivalent of comfort food: not spectacular, but very palatable and pleasing.</div>

I like Sabon and have been using it recently because it is elegant and unobtrusive and has the complete expert set. I tend to avoid Palatino because it still to me smacks of the era when there were so few fonts available on the Mac and it was massively overused, along with Copperplate Gothic.</div>

It's a value that works in a certain kind of layout. Spacious.
I don't think it's a mistake in a classic serifed face: the scotch romans had the same feature of an italic that took up the same amount of space as the roman.</div>
