  and am looking for a complimentary typeface to work alongside the custom type.\r\n\r\nIdeally
  I would like it to have perfectly circular 'o' 'a' characters etc with this being
  a prominent in the logo\r\n\r\nI have looked at the common ITC avant garde, Gotham
  etc but am looking for something less common.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your thoughts
  on both the logo and typeface suggestions. This is my first venture in the design
  industry, after finishing university 12 months ago and gaining a years experience
  I have decided to fly solo, scary times :\\\r\n\r\nLook forward to your suggestions\r\n\r\nCheers

    the circular shapes you specify, and also a touch of style, which you can fine
    tune by using various alternate \"city\" fonts.\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
