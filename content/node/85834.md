  only says XP and 2000 and Vista.\r\n\r\nIt also says \"Microsoft Font Validator
  requires '.NET Framework'  be installed.\" Are there any issues with that on Windows
  7?\r\n\r\nI google searched \"font validator system requirements\" and didn't find
  anything on it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone who can help."
