body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nCould someone help me find wich serif [or a close match] appears
  in the header of an early 1900s portuguese newspaper:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_3512.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nMyFont's
  WhatTheFont matched it with [[http://http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/springfield/springfield/|Springfield]],
  [[http://http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/sorbonne-bq/med-cnd/|Sorbonne]] and
  [[http://http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aruban/lotsa-lotta/bold-condensed/|Lotsa]]
  but I think there's too many differences to consider it an \"acceptable\" match.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nTiago"
