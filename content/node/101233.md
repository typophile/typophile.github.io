  body: well, no "match" per se, but you could probably take something like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/teuton/|Teuton
    Bold Italic]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/metral/|Metral Extra
    Bold Italic]] and modify from there.

  body: "thank you. I appreciate the help. I believe it is the font used for Toyota
    Camry. I believe it may not even be an actual font, more likely created as artwork.\r\n"

  body: Not the Camry logo at all. The only common element is the open delta-shaped
    'A'. The Camry logo has serif-ey swashes at the top of the A and the other four
    letters.  [[http://www.logoeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/toyota-camry-logo-vector-01.png|Camry
    Logo]].
