  resort. A client doesn't have a vector of their logo and I'm trying to match up
  the TM in their logo. I've managed to figure out/match up all other fonts but this.
  I know this isn't much to go on, but I cannot seem to find anything that's close
  to this. Any ideas at all, besides 'just use whatever' :)\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

    Black</a> (with some negative tracking) looks very close.\r\n\r\nBy the way: You
    posted this question on the old Type ID board (where I just saw it by chance).
    Next time, you should rather ask <a href=\"http://typophile.com/typeid\">here</a>,
    on the new board."

  body: Thank you so much. I had thought arial, but didn't have black, and figured
    it wasn't it anyway. Should have went with my gut on that one...thank you again.
    And I will definitely bookmark the new board!!!
