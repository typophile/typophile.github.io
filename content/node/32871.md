body: "Hello all.. I would like to know your thoughts on this dinner menu layout for
  an upscale, white tablecloth, quaint, 20 table restaurant that is housed in a structure
  built in 1848. The building almost feels castlesque with it's large stone walls
  and arch in the main dining room which is one of the focal points of the architecture.
  Pictures of the building can be found here <a href=\"http://www.gumbosroundrock.com/home\"
  target=\"_blank\">Gumbo's</a> and throughout the site. To give you a little more
  input, silverware is placed for each course of the dining experience.\r\n\r\nAbout
  my layout: I decided on Poetica because the styling of the face enhances the experience
  by playing off the ambiance of the building. The renaissance styling is a hit and
  this restaurant is rather elegant with amazing dishes. I also thought I remembered
  reading that this typeface was based off an old face from France.\r\n\r\nThis is
  my first time setting Poetica, so I don't know the hard and fast rules concerning
  mixing the different versions of Chancery, and how much is too many swirls and swooshes?
  I'm sure there are errors all over these pages, but please let me know what someone
  more experienced would have done in my situation. \r\n\r\nThere are still a couple
  of kinks to be worked out.. ie margins, and food descriptions/wording. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\ndolch\r\n\r\n"

    body: "My only suggestion would be to take a mock up of the menu into the actual
      restaurant and try to read it in the available light, especially at night, when
      most restaurants do the bulk of their business. In many cases the light is fairly
      low, which can make reading difficult, particularly for older viewers. I'm only
      on my 40s, but I've had trouble reading menus in some restaurants. So, often
      larger type is better in this setting. Something to consider anyhow. Best wishes.\r\n\r\nPaul

  body: "Very classy yet unique.\r\n\r\nThis might be heretical for the tone, but
    I wonder if a bold humanist sans might work better for the dish titles. Now, the
    page looks somewhat gray, and my eye flits around too much without settling on
    the important bits.\r\n\r\nGive some though to line breaks. Especially in menus,
    you might want to have, say, \"creamy\" and \"garlic\" on the same line. It all
    depends on the emphasis; menu design is a bit like poetry in that way.\r\n\r\nI'd
    tone down the swashes. Maybe use them only at the start & end of each phrase?
    And I'd avoid the swashy g, s and e -- to me, they look too much like they've
    got misplaced accents.\r\n\r\nThe prices get a bit lost.  Perhaps an em space
    before them instead of just a word space?  These, too, could be in the same sans,
    although that might be too much, and *too* much emphasis on the prices. Worth
    a try, though.\r\n\r\nYou use at least two dingbats, all of which are a tad large
    and complex for their purpose as a separator. I suggest using a single small but
    graceful dingbat.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you do a spelling check.  Avocado, at
    least, is spelled wrong.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: "<cite>\u2020 indicates a premium [dead fish?]</cite> (of course, the asparagus
    will be dead when served)\r\nNo offence intended (I just couldn't resist), but
    perhaps you should change the footnote mark for something different (* or + or
    \xA7 or something the like). I agree that the dish titles are hard to read, but
    you could as well leave them as is because noone will recognise them (if you read
    the menu then you'll probably get the idea yourself that a tenderloin might be
    a steak and don't need this information). But perhaps it would be good to ask
    some potential (or even existing) customers for a test (if they complain, there
    is evidence that there has to be a better way to do it)."

  body: "I'll second all of the comments that have been made -- I'd never be able
    to read this in a restaurant because it's just too darned small.  (good thing
    I keep a small flashlight in my purse!)\r\n\r\nStephen's idea of running a focus
    group is brilliant: if they've got a few regulars, the resto should bring them
    in (maybe on a Saturday afternoon), sit them down with some appetizers, and let
    them look at several different mock-ups.  \r\n\r\nMy experiences in doing this
    is that you get a much more accurate menu (since most people want (edit: to know)
    what the food is, not a bunch of touchy-feely descriptions), and happy patrons
    -- good word-of-mouth beats any other kind of PR anyday...."

  body: Ditto on John's separator comment. I think a simple dot would suffice, especially
    with all of the swashes.

      is kind of dim lighting in this establishment, and all of the waiters carry
      mini-flashlights and reading glasses around for those patrons that don't have
      the best of eyesight. \r\n\r\nI will still make some of these adjustments to
      help clean up the swashiness and I'll post the progress as soon as I am satisfied
      with the changes.\r\n\r\nI appreciate it everyone!\r\ndolch"

  body: Or give the menu with prices only to the men, like they did until very recently
    at the Four Seasons. Then again when you looked around the room at all the paunchy
    old men with young pretty asian women you kinda got the idea why.

  body: I have been to establishments where reading glasses were provided, and may
    I recommend that you have your waiters carry quality styles, such as <a href="http://www.readinstyle.com/catalog/Eyebobs.aspx">EyeBobs</a>.
    There is nothing like getting ready to order a $45 entree and a $200 dollar bottle
    of wine, only to have the waiter pull out a pair of cheap dollar store readers
    to help me see the menu. Now, if the waiter presents me with a nice pair of glasses
    to assist me, I feel like royalty. And isn't that what you want in an upscale
    restaurant, to have your customers feel like royalty?
