body: "I need something that for example you can pass in a matrix to it as a parameter
  and it will automatically modify all the glyphs in the font file.  I need to both
  italicize and embolden a font as well.\r\n\r\nActually I did manage to accomplish
  this  with ttx and the FreeType library.  FreeType has methods like FT_Outline_Transform
  and FT_Outline_Embolden, and with ttx its easy to get to all the glyph data and
  then recompile it all back into a font file.  But the process is slow:  5-10 seconds
  for a single font.  The reason its slow is at least because its dealing with that
  huge ttx text file. \r\n\r\nBut since matrix transformations and embolding is so
  trivial and ubiquitous I can't believe there's not a command line tool already somewhere
  to do this but haven't found it anywhere.  (The complicating factor in automating
  this is of course the byzantine TT/OT format.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Actually I did just now encounter the docs for Adobe's rotateFont so it looks
    like the italic at least is doable.  But emboldening cannot be done properly just
    with matrices I don't think, so if anyone knows of a command line tool that encompasses
    emboldening as well...

  body: "Still looking into this - need to figure out if I can use something like
    rotateFont to do Bold.  In their docs it has the following:\r\n\r\n\"For example,
    the argument:\r\n   -matrix 2.0 0 0 0.75 100 200\r\nwill:\r\n - scale up horizontal
    coordinates by a factor of 2,\r\n - condense the vertical coordinates by a factor
    three-quarters,\r\n - move the entire glyph left by 100\r\n - move the entire
    glyph up by 200.\"\r\n\r\nIt doesn't call the above Bold though.  Is there some
    sort of matrix transform that will in fact approximate Bold.  The routine from
    FreeType i mentioned in the OP, \"FT_Outline_Embold\", is pretty short, but doesn't
    seem to be using matrices as such (still haven't completely figured it out though.)\r\nAnyway,
    was hoping there was some knowledge to be found here, as algorithmic bolding of
    text (for example in software when a font doesn't have a bold variant defined)
    seems fairly commonplace."

    Word solution: place the text twice (or thrice, or even more often) with a small
    offset. Yuck.\r\nThe usually recommended InDesign solution: give the text a small
    outline (although I should mention that this <em>also</em> usually is followed
    by \"Butt ugly, so don't do it and purchase a real bold font\").\r\n\r\nDoing
    the Word thing in memory, on a glyph, would mean you'd have to intersect the character
    with itself at an offset. But it will, generally speaking, result in extremely
    ugly characters.\r\nDoing the InD thing in memory should also be possible but
    <em>also</em> needs a full CSG operation -- first, you have to create an outline
    of the glyph, then expand the stroke into a fill form, then intersect it with
    the original.\r\n\r\nIf you can get hold of the original outline coordinates and
    vectors, I think a rather good way would be to move left-pointing lines a bit
    to the left and right-pointing lines a bit to the right. (And probably something
    similar if you want to change the height as well.) You cannot use a single transformation
    on each separate coordinate, as that would amount to simply <em>stretching</em>
    the character -- the matrix you posted does that."

    has to be command line so I could invoke it from my own app.  There are command

    ttx which reformats everything in a clean accessible way, but its slow.  SO I
    just want a command line app that emboldens everything in the font, and considering

    in  whatever version I downloaded is 14 mb.  So that's nothing I can distribute.
    \ Its a big bloated behemoth with overlapping confusing documentation and features.
    \ Glad some people have been able to make use of it.\r\n\r\nJust to review my
    experience fwiw (for anyone else's benefit) as I said in the OP I had what I needed
    working with FreeType and ttx.  Just to elaborate, FreeType can perform various
    transforming algorithms on glyphs but for whatever reason is not set up to write
    that all back to the ttf file.  THat is where ttx comes in - a well known utility
    that will decompile a ttf (and other formats) into XML and then recompile it back
    into a ttf.  So what I needed working I had working with those two (FreeType and
    ttx). But the problem is ttx is in python (an interpreted, and slow system) and
    also its generates this humongous XML file that is dealing with. So the time penalty
    for all that is about 5 seconds, which in the context of user software is a little
    excessive.\r\n\r\nBut there truly for whatever reason just doesn't seem to be
    any command line utilities that will perform straightforwatrd glyph transformations
    on a font file.  Its ridiculous.  I mentioned 'rotateFont' previously, which is
    part of something Adobe released - some set of tools their developers ostensibly
    use that they're magnanimously making available to us all.  But after struggling
    with RotateFont for half and hour I gave up.  I defy anyone to make it do what
    its purported to do.\r\n\r\nSo in the last couple of days I did write my own parser
    to get the glyph data from a ttf/otf file and then put it back after making changes
    (thus avoiding the time penalty of ttx involving python and that huge text file).
    And as I expected it immediately shaved off all that excess time. However thus
    far it correctly parses the font file only about 2/3's of the time.  So there
    are just a lot of nuances in the ttf/otf format that you have to nail down.  I'm
    not going to reinvent the wheel there, so have just decided to go with my original
    setup of ttx and Freetype.  \r\n\r\nNot to knock ttx at all, because it is quite
    accurate and reliable as far as dealing with the font file - its just kind of
    slow.  So why no one ported its functionality to an efficient (c++ based) executable
    is beyond me.  (You don't need Python installed to run ttx,  but its still accessing
    it via a dll or something so still running as an interpreted program.)  Actually
    the ttx version I'm using is from 2002, because that was what was in the win binary
    distributable from their own website, but there are a score of other  ttx versions
    floating around as well from different years, so my next step will be to maybe
    compile the lastest ttx source code. So anyway, in case anyone googles this topic
    in the future maybe the above will be of use.\r\n\r\nNote:  In those Adobe utilities
    is something called sfntedit, and that is actually quite good (the only thing
    in it that's good, other than ttx which they include with their stuff as well.)
    \  But sfntedit will extract a font table to a file and put it back, but its very
    useful and reliable.\r\n\r\n"
