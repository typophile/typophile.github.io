  body: "No one?\r\n\r\nThis was used on a Prince LP in 1981. The question is if this
    font was custom made. As no one seems to recognise it, can I assume this is indeed
    the case?"

  body: Probably very good assumption as by now someone would have identified it I
    am sure.  It may never have been a "font" as such but a collection of drawn letters.

  body: i'll admit that i've looked into this a bit, but not extensively. my guess
    is that you are correct. you could start maybe with something like Broadway Compress
    to create the customization needed. (just a quick pick... i'm sure there are other
    places to begin).

  body: "Thanks for your replies. My other assumption is that this is an actual font,
    but that it is so ugly no one ever used it since, and no one ever made an effort
    to digitise it. I'm still hoping this turns up in a 70s book with fonts.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I don't need to to recreate the font, I just want to know its designer/name
    and if it was custom made."

  body: "Note that Fontographer (the first digital font editor) was released in 1986.
    Coupled with the fact that before the digital era font publishers rarely released
    such sloppy (and in certain aspects unorthodox) work, the chances of this being
    a font are indeed low. However, your sample <em>is</em> an alphabetic setting...
    Did you assemble it yourself? If not, it might be worth tracking down the person
    who did.\r\n\r\nAs for finding the person who did the original design: if it's
    not a font, it was probably done by the same person who did the LP cover.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is it possible Price made those letters himself? A biography might reveal a mention
    of him liking to doodle letters in high-school... The Letters Formerly Not Known
    To Be A Font.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I wouldn't be surprised if it was designed by Prince. Also, there were ways
    back then to make your own "fonts" if you had access to a stat camera, an X-acto
    knife and some patience.

  body: "No doubt Prince was involved. But he wasn't the one to draw the letters,
    or do the actual lay out.\r\n\r\nI am researching the artwork of Prince's albums,
    and this font has been one of the puzzles that has been bugging me for some time.
    For now I will consider it to be custom made for this project.\r\n\r\nWhile I
    have your attention, Prince's album from 1980 features this font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dm-font_3495.jpg]\r\n\r\nAgain,
    this may or may not be custom made. Does anyone have a clue?\r\nPeople have suggested
    it is the [[http://www.dafont.com/lemiesz.font|Lemiesz]], but this is not the
    same.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

    the letters, it's pretty obvious.

    referring to Rakowski's [[http://www.dafont.com/lintsec.font|Lintsec font]], it
    looks quite a bit different than ATF's [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/text%3Astencil+text%3A%28Gerry+Powell%29/fonts/|Stencil

  body: That's funny--back around 1990 or so I used to go to this computer store in
    Savage, MN, and they had boxes of disks full of "shareware" fonts, sold very cheaply.
    I bought a bunch of them, thinking there might be something usable on them (very
    little). Looking at the fonts Rakowski did, nearly everything on those disks was
    his. Huh.
