  I click the logo it gives me a Ascender of 740 and a Desender of -219 but I always
  thought they should both add up to 1000, so should it be 740/-260. Also if I select
  the Cap Height figure the small window shows the uppercase H with the red line across
  the top but should this red line be slightly higher so it touches the top of the
  uppercase O.\r\n\r\nIs it best to set the Cap height and x height in the glyph window
  by dragging the dotted lines that repersent the Cap and x height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    factor in the talus (internal leading) as well.\r\nFor example in a font I'm working
    on the ascenders are 704,\r\nthe descenders are 256, the upper talus is 30 and
    the lower\r\ntalus is 10. You typically need some talus to avoid collisions\r\nwhen
    leading is zero. But too much talus will make your font\r\nless efficient and
    look discouragingly small on the body.\r\n\r\nBTW you don't <cite>have</cite>
    to use 1000, although it's the\r\nsafest so if you have no reason not to use it,
    use it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
