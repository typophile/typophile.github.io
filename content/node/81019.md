body: "Is it possible in OTF to use two shapes of Diacritics, where each shape meant
  to display in a different point size.\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to display 6,8,10
  point sizes with different shape of diacritics, and for larger point size use other
  shape of Diacritics in same font face name."

  body: Not automatically, but with features. I think, it is better to provide different
    styles for different sizes. Except from that it is questionable, whether there
    is only a necessity to adjust the diacritics for different sizes.

  body: "The \"size\" OpenType Layout feature allows that, at least in theory. It
    works so that a font is switched to a different font automatically at a defined
    point size. However, none of the major applications support the \"size\" feature.
    To my knowledge, only XeTeX (the opensource automated typesetting engine based
    on TeX) supports it. \r\n\r\nAlso, in small pixel sizes, you can adjust the screen
    appearance of the letterforms using hinting, especially in TrueType-flavored OpenType
    fonts. Different operating systems and applications will process the hinting in
    different ways, though. On Windows, the results of the adjustments will be more
    visible than on Mac OS X. "

  body: "This is not only non-automatic, no way expressable at low resolution and
    small sizes, and unidentifiable for a range of sizes, but the only practical  way
    to inform the user of even the presence of a size master is in the font family
    name. And for a full picture of any such family, the entire family or it's marketing
    materials,  must be present if the user is to sort it out for proper use.\r\n\r\n"

    Many thanks, I will try \"size\" and reply here soon.\r\n\r\nDberlow: I like your
    idea.\r\n\r\nmany thanks, new ideas are welcomed."

    does not help for multiple size-specific glyphs in the same font.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
