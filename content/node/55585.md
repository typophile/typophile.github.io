body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a logo for a Shoe Store named Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe
  palette was already created by the interior designers, with the typical turquoise/orange
  scheme you'd typically find in an Arizona theme. The store will eventually become
  a franchise, so I am keeping the design somewhat simple to accommodate future changes
  throughout the many applications it will be used.\r\n\r\nI used Saracen as the typeface.
  I love this, because it addresses the diamond shapes Arizona logos often use, without
  having to actually use them (because of it's chunky, pointy serifs). Right now I
  haven't gone into the stage of adding a visual element to make it unique, I just
  wanted to see what people thought of the typeface, colors, etc.\r\n\r\nOne problem
  I may have, is that it might look too Chunky or Rigid for a higher-end shoe store.
  I'd like to hear your opinions, but so far I think it looks pretty sexy. I just
  love the typeface.\r\n\r\nRight now the stores will be located in Quebec or Eastern
  Canada.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!!!!"

    if you couple it with a lighter sans serif that looks more \"high end\". Maybe
    Museo sans or Frutiger. \r\n\r\nYou know they wear sandals down in Arizona right?

    maybe trade gothic condensed or something\r\n\r\nArizona seems like an investment
    spot for French Canadians. Florida too! "

  body: I'm really enjoying these. Like you said, it does a nice job of adding the
    "diamond" thing in there without it being obnoxious. I prefer the all caps version
    but both are nice.

    without looking cliche. It\u2019s a very smart solution."

  body: I really enjoy what you have done here. I think the type chosen works very
    well. Considering it being a higher-end store I do prefer the all caps. The letter
    forms in the all caps version just seem to have a more serious tone and tend to
    be not as playful as the first version. Hope all turns out well! Keep us posted!

  body: Makes me think of candy...and shoes can be eye candy. I think the typeface
    looks great. It kind of has an "indie" feel. At first the touching serifs bothered
    me but I don't mind them now.

  body: It doesn't say "higher-end" at all to me, but I think that's really tricky
    with the other givens of the commission (which this does serve well). I agree
    with Jeremiah that the all caps is appropriately more serious - I also like the
    play of Z and N in that version.

  body: "it's got potential ... but yeah it's not screaming \"high-end\" in fact it's
    doing the opposite. but perhaps with some great execution and interior design
    it can work.\r\n\r\nin brief .. it's not creating the feeling of somewhere I'd
    like to go (read: \"visit Arizona\") it's a great opportunity to great a sense
    of place - that does exist but doesn't necessarily have to exist in reality. \r\n<br
