    my browser has been misbehaving lately.

    what's the font used in the beginning? That strange/po-mo-ish bracketed slab with
    the double storey \"e\"?"

    have always enjoyed the lively debate & discussions; thanks for all the infos
    & news... \r\nWith the release of the mentioned video; I thought this could be
    a good occassion to finally come out of the bushes & present myself...\r\nI hope
    you are enjoying the video & song; must say a great thanks to my friend Mike Croft
    for coming up with the music; atleast it gave us a good laugh making it...\r\nYour
    comments on the fonts are very true; I had a bit of a hard time getting hold of
    the right fonts for each style & being on zero budget; I used alot of my own fonts
    designs... True that Hobo for the french was not ideal but I just could not get
    hold of a good version of the Metro font used in the original Tyopmania clip...
    \r\nFeel free to give us some feedback & critics! "

  body: 'Michael, you probably didn''t realize how appropriate that typeface actually
    is. Erik often greets me and other guys in the office with a "hey, big boy" when
    he comes to visit San Francisco. Not in the melodramatic girly tone most Americans
    use it but more like a matter-of-fact father: "how are things, son?" It''s quite
    amusing.'

    very much, also because it speaks as an confirmation of my graduation work, where

    typography (related to music). You can see it here (sorry, only in Slovenian):
