  on. It will eventually be incorporated into a poster design. Just wanted to get
  some feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MI004_AnologRoots_C1_WEBsmall_5038.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
  is a version with an alternate \"g\". Any preference?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MI004_AnologRoots_C2_WEBsmall_5273.jpg]"

  body: "Both 'g's look backwards to me. Perhaps you could snake the tail back and
    turn clockwise once it exits the bowl (if that makes sense). The 'n' seems a bit
    wide too. Otherwise, it's nice.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Top one looks better to me. 'S' looks a bit ackward. The downward curve looks
    misaligned. I also agree with 'n' being a tad bit to wide. Noticed all but one
    of the 'o's is not altered. The extra little 'swoosh' on the 'g' seems like it's
    trying to hard. It's like you have a lower case g and upper case g all in one.

  body: Can't say I know much about type but that's what I thought, "hard to read".
    Depends what the poster is and where it's getting shown.

  body: 'This is indeed hard to read. What I''d suggest is: "n" is definitelly too
    wide, "s" is too closed on top, I don''t like the bottom "n" extender. Version
    1 "g" is better but the horizontal line on the descender is strange. Why is it
    there anyway?'

  body: Thanks for the response. I haven't had time to work on it again since posting
    but I agree about the N's width and the S being too closed. The G was kind of
    an experiment. It just came out in the process and I thought I'd see how others
    felt. The "hard to read" factor will be part of the type being discovered amongst
    tree roots made of analog audio cables. When it's all said and done, I'll repost
    and see how it goes. Thanks!
