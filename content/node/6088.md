body: Hello all. I&#39;m posting an image of a font I am working on. It&#39;s my first
  font and I just started reading about the font-mojo, so it&#39;s gonna take some
  time before this font is ready. I noticed after going through my font list that
  it looks somewhat like Burosama &#40;not as classy maybe&#41;. I wanted to give
  it a 1930s look while trying to bring something new as well. There&#39;s a lot to
  do still anyway. Let me know what you think of it.

    <BR>Hi Philippe, use the Upload Attachment Instead of links. You have a big A
    there!

    look it up later.

  body: 'Hi phillipe <BR> <BR>I think this needs a lot of feedback and a lot of modifications
    from you. <BR>your big A is one, but there are others, let get started: <BR> <BR>Firts,
    i must think that mathemathicaly your design is very consistant, but opticaly
    has a lot of defects. <BR> <BR>the termination of your  of your C and G is not
    quite right, i think  you should make a diagonal cut there. <BR> <BR>The detail
    on you H and T is bothering me <BR> <BR>the round corner on your F makes the letters
    fall to the right. <BR> <BR>your L looks more like an H <BR> <BR>on your S, Y,
    Z, 2 and 5 the youu should drop down the center point. <BR> <BR>i dont understand
    the extension of the bottom horizontal  on your E, and in you S the left termination
    should be shorter. <BR> <BR>you should rotate 90 degrees your X and see how it
    looks. <BR> <BR>keep the good work <BR> <BR>CG <BR> <BR>PD. i think you should
    work a lot on the optical corrections, your O should be a little bit bigger. <BR>

  body: Thanks for the feedback. <BR> <BR>The S was difficult to make, I didn&#39;t
    want the center point to be in the middle but I might have to. As for the E, I
    tried to have the top and bottom extensions to be equal but I remember it made
    it look too &#34;prominent&#34;, but now that I look at the other letters it might
    be a good idea to change it. I&#39;ll have the change the 3 or else it would look
    like an inverted 3. <BR> <BR>I definitly have to reduce the A&#39;s lenght. I&#39;ll
    post more soon.

  body: The Z is too much like a 2 or a backwards 5.  Don&#39;t look at the Bauhaus
    font, it may influence you too much.

  body: 'I&#39;d say &#34;Don&#39;t look at the Bauhaus font, period&#34;. In my opinion
    it&#39;s Benguiat&#39;s black sheep &#40;for the name, if not for any other reason:
    the design is light years away from Bauhaus-stated &#34;rationale&#34;&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I think such a &#34;hard&#34; design like the one you&#39;re attempting, Philippe,
    leaves not so much space for interpretation. You risk to fall in the obvious or
    to overtly charge it of the things Cristian grouped as &#34;flaws&#34; which would
    make the thing not so usable. <BR> <BR>So, my only advice &#40;very personal&#41;
    would be to use the geometric framework you like as a basis to add subtle elements
    in order to increase the interest of the Eye. I.E. something like terminal parts,
    fake or true inktraps, modulation in some form. But this of course will send you
    in another direction.'

  body: Actually I didn&#39;t look at Bauhaus. I only looked at Arial for proportion
    reasons &#40;since this is my first font I didn&#39;t know what to use as a base
    for widths&#41;. I noticed after making the font while going through the fonts
    I have that it looked like a harder version of Burosama. Anyway I brought some
    corrections, you can now compare &#40;top is old, bottom is new, new numbers as
    well&#41;.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/43073.jpg" alt="font">

  body: Hi, Philippe, <BR> <BR>I think that your new 7 is an improvement. But I think
    that your 5 is trying to be an S, or a horizontally-flipped Z... maybe the top
    vertical stroke should have a right-angle transition to the middle horizontal
    stroke, rather than a curved one. <BR> <BR>I agree with Cristian that the center
    points of S, Z, 2 and 5 should be dropped a bit -- slightly above the center,
    to keep the top counterspaces from seeming bigger than the lower ones. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    <i>it looked like a harder version of Burosama</i> <BR> <BR>I think you mean <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-busorama/bold/">Busorama</a>,
    right? <BR> <BR>Keep up the good work! <BR>R.
