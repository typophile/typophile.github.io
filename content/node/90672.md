body: "I have been developing fonts for the past one year so I am relatively new to
  font development.\r\n\r\nDoes any one know how to add the KERN feature for punctuation
  marks using MS volt? I am trying to alter the punctuation positions for the Garamond
  font using the KERN feature, but it doesn't work. I have opened the Garamond font
  in MS VOLT and allowed volt to overwrite the OT features. I have then developed
  my own OT features. KERN feature works for other letters of the English alphabet
  and for Bengali language alphabets. But even for the Bengali language alphabets,
  the KERN feature does not work if I include the punctuation marks such as semicolons,
  hyphens, emdash, endash, leftparen, rightparen, leftquote, rightquote etc.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help."

    modification.]"

  body: I am using Adobe Garamond Pro. I am using it for experimental / learning purposes
    only and not for commercial purposes. Hopefully this is OK. I am using Fontlab
    True type to create the Bengali glyphs and added them to the Adobe Garamond Pro
    font so I can have a multilingual font. I am testing them using the MS Volt Proofing
    tool. Everything seems to work in the proofing tool but does not work when I generate
    and install the font file for applications such as MS Word or Adove InDesign.

  body: "Okay, this should be fine according to Adobe's standard font license, so
    long as you do not distribute the modified font in any way.\r\n\r\nI've done some
    work with kerning between Devanagari and punctuation, but I cannot recall the
    details of how and where it works or does not work. If I can find some extra time,
    I'll look into this. I recall that in MS apps this depends on the version of Windows."

    Back in 2007, I was commissioned to add 20 new\r\naccented characters (for Sanskrit
    transliteration) to Garamond\r\nPremier Pro; since both the client and myself
    owned a license\r\nfor it, it was fine.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, John and HHP for clarifying the license bit. I can now continue with
    a clear conscience :).\r\n\r\nJohn,\r\n\r\nIf you can provide me with some guidance
    drawing from your past experience with using punctuation with Devanagari, I would
    be very grateful. By the way, I am using MS Windows 7 and Word 2007. On the Mac
    its OSX 10.7 and InDesign CS5 in which the World-Ready Composer has been enabled
    using a third-party script, that enables composition of Indic languages.\r\n\r\nHHP,\r\n\r\nI
    am interested in purchasing the Adobe Premier Pro font that you developed for
    Sanskrit transliteration. Do you know where I can find it?\r\n\r\nMany thanks
    to both of you for responding,\r\n\r\nGaura\r\n "

    the party that commissioned the\r\nwork probably cannot do so. There <em>is</em>

    the same as Garamond Pro; although\r\nI haven't carried out a careful comparison
