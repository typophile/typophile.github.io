body: "At the risk of alienating at least some of the type designers and vendors at
  Typhophile, I'd like to start a discussion about \"unprofessional\" fonts from \"professional\"
  designers. In the last few years I've purchased at least 4 font families from well
  regarded designers and vendors, and paid no less than $125  for each of them that
  included from 4 to 20 fonts that I had to \"fix\" in order for the fonts to be useable.
  I don't know why I want to protect the guilty, but I'd rather not name the fonts
  or the designers.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into a debate about Windows naming conventions
  (R/I/B/BI), two of the font families were not named as a family, e.g., their names
  were Fontname Regular, Fontname Italic, etc, so that you could not apply the I/B/BI
  attributes (in a word processing program, e.g.) to call up the appropriate font.
  There may be some reason for this for some people in special fields using special
  software, but for the rest of us, its a PITA.\r\n\r\nThe other two font families
  were internally mislabeled (I don't remember exactly how, but something like) the
  family name was correct but the attributes were misapplied (i.e., the regular was
  labeled as italic).\r\n\r\nWhat's with this? How may others have had similar problems?
  Why does this happen?\r\n\r\nIf this happens to you, and you can't or don't want
  to correct this on your own, what's your recourse? If you've tried to deal with
  the designer or vendor about this kind of issue, have you had any luck?"

    directly. that seems like the most logical thing to do. i've personally done this
    on several occasions. some foundries will take heed and make changes, others will
    not acknowledge your complaint: at least that's been my experience."

  body: My experience is they are willing to fix things. One even volunteered to fill
    in the international characters. A lot of times when there is a mistake, they
    won't know because no one says anything. Best to let them know.

  body: "At the design agency where I am interning I was given the fonts I would need
    for working on projects for the particular client I am assigned to. However, I
    was given the entire family in about 10 seperate files. Some include only bold
    all caps and regular, some just book and book italic. Not to mention the font
    name is so long with the addition of the type style tacked on that I have to blindly
    click through them in InDesign, because all I can read is MetaPlusB (which could
    be \"bold all caps\", \"black\", \"bold italic\" or one of 4 others).\r\n\r\nThank
    god they are changing their typeface after the re-arc.\r\n\r\n\r\n... _._. ...

  body: 'A disproportionate amount of font problems I encounter end up being from
    vendors in the "abandonware" category. Vendors that are currently shipping fonts
    typically work to protect their reputation, as does any other software vendor.
    Foundries like Adobe can dedicate resources for testing. However, smaller designers
    sometimes must rely more on feedback from customers. My experience is that most
    foundries are very interested in resolving these sorts of issues quickly, because
    they don''t want to deal with similar complaints from multiple customers. If they
    can get a problem fixed early it won''t come up again. Sometimes with legacy fonts,
    these problems can be remedied by a simple rebuild in FontLab. Another issue is
    font vendors with large varied legacy libraries. I''ve noticed that fonts.com
    will sometimes sell parts of a PostScript font that contain suitcase references
    to the other parts of a family--technically orphans. This really a junky way to
    do things. They''re probably not focused on expanding their sales of PostScript
    fonts at the moment though. So, I guess as a generalization, ownership and a vendor''s
    pride in a quality product are probably the most important factors. I would contact
    them directly. '
