  body: i suggest looking for the base font. looks to me like the spurs were added
    on after the fact (note how inconsistent they are in size, placement, and shape).

  body: The spurs are inconsistent? What about everything else?

  body: Looks totally hand-lettered to me. Having a look to [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead
    Fonts]] would be worth a shot. Something like [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/signmaker.php|Signmaker]]
    could work pretty well as alternative adding some median spurs.

  body: the spurs were the obvious tipoff. i assume a base font would be available,
    just for reference to start mods. geez.

  body: I think it may be just be a really, really bad digtization of the original
    sign. Which likely was hand-lettered! (But probably had better looking spurs.)

    style font, i wasnt sure with the capital letters if it was a font or not. i just
    traced it in corel to get rid of the rest of the design.  [[http://ts1.mm.bing.net/th?id=H.4670490165184284&pid=15.1]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/th_5176.jpg]"
