body: "I will be visiting the west coast for a long Labor Day weekend. If anyone would
  like to meet up to chat about type, designing fonts, open source, art, typosium,
  snarks, design or anything else interesting, just send me a message. In return,
  I'll buy the first round of coffee or beer! Sun or Mon is best. If I can fit it
  in, I'd love an excuse to visit SF.\r\n\r\nYou can email me through choz at exclamachine
  dot com, or pop a message through typophile if I am on."

    Area, the Bay Bridge between San Francisco and Oakland will be closed over the
    entire Labor Day holiday weekend (8 p.m. Friday, August 31, 2007 \u2014 5 a.m.
    Tuesday, September 4, 2007), so plan travel routes accordingly. [[http://511.org/promo/baybridge/default.asp|Detour
