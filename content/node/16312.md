  i ended up with this logo...\r\n\r\nany comment / critic would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nbesides
  of that, which fonts would go well with the din and would also be suitable for a
  cont. art museum (usage: letterhead, etc.. / \"normal\" textfont)?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arte_e_tempo.jpg]"

    lose legibility at small sizes. \r\ni like the way the diagonals create a cornered
    border around the word tempo.\r\noptically the blue on black makes the black look
    brown. maybe thats just my monitor/bad eyes."

      also because of the condensed font.. but if i give this \"subtitle\" to much
      room, it gets to much attention in comparision to the name of the museum.\r\ni
      thought i can remove the subtitle when the logo is printed in small sizes...
      bad idea?"

    a simple way to handle this. but i'm sure you can typographically address this
    with some work.

      expo hannover (the moiree \"bubble\", which is always changing)... i think for
      something like a contemporary art museum, a dynamic (i mean always transforming)
      logo would be perfect.. \r\n\r\ni didn't want to limit myself, by not using
      a mark. if i use one, i think it has to be symbolic (communicating the aspect
      of change and dynamic).\r\n\r\nthe only thing i know is that the museum has
      more or less 8 subareas...\r\n\r\nexposition, moving exposition, moving library,
      show, conference, cinema, theater, projection\r\n\r\nmaybe i can do something

    I like your idea of using the 8 sublevels of the museum. \r\n\r\nThere should
    be a concept behind your design, don't just try and do something that looks \"cool\".
    I hope I don't sound harsh here, we all have a tendency to get caught up in executing
    without a strategy first. \r\n\r\nDive in to what the museum is about and develop
    your concept out of that. You will have to explain your design, and why you arrived
    at your solution, so you should have a good idea behind it. You may have done
    a lot of this thinking already, but to me this design doesn't feel contemporary.\r\n\r\nOne
    final thought - if most museums are using sans-serif, maybe a contemporary museum
    would break away from that and try something new to set itself apart? Best of
    luck on your project."
