(well maybe) It depends if you want the scaling to be accomplished under your watchful eye, or any old way.

The bottom line is that if your details, or the target resolution is going to create scaling artifacts, be careful: "Reducing the UPM without scaling the outlines will have the same optical effect as scaling up the outlines without changing the UPM"
This is, after all what hinting is for so if the Adam statement is always true, hinting would never be required.

Wasn't there some calligraphic font that was scaled to 256 or something nuts like that? And caused a lot of problems? It's the only commercial PS font I can think of that did that. For what it's worth, and I think it's worth a lot, Robert Slimbach uses scaling constantly in his editing.

This is still true today, and it's probably the only aspect of type design in which Robert is more cavalier and less anal-retentive than I am (usually it's vice versa).

Having uniform stem widths may be less important than you think. When I first presented the rather raw data of my 'Valerie' typeface to Adobe, I said, well, you know, this is pretty rough, so I guess the first thing to do is to measure the stem widths and regularize them. Robert and Carol were horrified and forbade it. 'Leave the stems as they are; they look OK to us; trust your eye' basically sums up what they said. Obviously this approach will not work for all typefaces, but it is amazing how many it <em>will</em> work for. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">My suspicion is that perfectly consistent stem widths are a non-issue at imagesetter resolutions and much more of an issue at screen resolution. But perhaps even then tiny inconsistencies can result in a more organic and less sterile typeface.

That being said, I think the average would-be type designer would benefit from first learning the discipline of consistency and then later figuring out when, how, and how much to deviate from it. Sort of like learning how to balance letters, where first you need to figure out what makes letters seem optically balanced and then decide when it's okay to be a bit off-balance to increase the liveliness of the typeface.
