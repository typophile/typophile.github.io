  generated as OTF, primarily for use in InDesign, gets updated from time to time.\r\n\r\nSomewhere
  along the line the class based kerning stopped working in InDesign. I know it WAS
  working because when we first completed the font (compiled form the client's multiple
  fonts) we needed to use  Karsten Luecke's fabulous \"KLTF-MakeKernFeature\" Python
  script to compile the kern feature.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, thus far, I've been unable
  to determine when the problem began occurring. I only have old FontLab files as
  back up and NOT the old OTF files, will possibly try generating those to see what
  comes of it.\r\n\r\nSo, while I investigate this further, entering panic mode, I
  thought I'd post asking what would cause this? That is, the class based kerning
  to not work in InDesign CS6.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nKen"

  body: "It is not a FontLab Studio issue nor an issue with my script.\r\n\r\nWe solved
    it off the list, but since the issue (in a nutshell: features\_stopped working
    in a more recent version of InDesign) has come up a few times recently, it seems
    worth to remind of adding proper languagesystem statements when defining OTL features:\r\n\r\nDefining
    OTL features is only part one of the job, the other part consists in associating
    these features with scripts and languages \u2013 applications apply only those
    features that are associated with script and language that match those of a given
    text.\r\nIn AFDKO's OpenType feature file syntax, there are two ways to associate
    features with scripts and languages.\r\n1) Stating <em>script [script name];</em>,
    stating <em>language [language name];</em>, followed by the substitution or positioning
    statements, right in the feature definition.\r\n2) Enumerating all possible script/language
    combinations in languagesystem statements that precede the feature definitions.
    (In FLS, their proper place is in the OpenType Panel's bottom right field.) These
    statements look like this:\r\n<em>languagesystem DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem grek dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem cyrl dflt;</em>\r\nNow,
    features whose definitions do not mention any script and language will be associated
    with script/language combinations as mentioned in these languagesystem statements.\r\n\r\nIf
    languagesystem statements are missing, AFDKO will silently add one <em>but not
    all that may be required</em>. As an effect, you may end up generating mal-functioning
    fonts without even noticing. This is what happened here.\r\n\r\nFor details, please

    explains, we went from InD CS3 to CS6. CS3 didn't care about the language, CS6
    does.\r\n\r\nThank you again, Karsten."

  body: "So, now I'm wondering about InDesign's \"[No language]\" setting.\r\nI've
    now defined the following for the languages:\r\n<code>languagesystem DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem grek dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem copt dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    cyrl dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem hebr dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem math dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    runr dflt;</code>\r\n\r\nI would have thought that <code>languagesystem DFLT dflt;</code>
    would have taken care of this, but apparently not.\r\n\r\nIt would be accidental
    if we had \"[No language]\" applied in InDesign and it seems crazy that InD will,
    potentially, ignore all features if \"[No language]\" is applied.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know if there is anything I can do in the font to avoid having InD ignore
    the features when \"[No language]\" is applied?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    ACaslonPro goes not have the problem, going to investigate that.\r\nAlso, when
    I compile the font I'm getting the following warning from FontLab:\r\n<code>[WARNING]
    <DOML-Regular> Use of DFLT tag has been deprecated. It will work, but please use
    'dflt' instead. [C:/Users/kenkrugh.TEKNTYPE/Documents/FontLab/Studio5/fontlab.fea
    90]</code>.\r\nMaybe the line <code>languagesystem DFLT dflt;</code> is not getting
    implemented even though the warning says it will work?"

    5.1.x and later versions know about script DFLT. Old FLS 5.0.4 does not.\r\nTo
    address FLS 5.0.4's trouble with script DFLT, Adam Twardoch has made a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/29469#comment-168692\"
    target=\"_blank\">nice script</a>. You would add the line <em>languagesystem DFLT
    dflt;</em>, you'd generate a buggy TTF or OTF from FLS 5.0.4, and finally you
    would run the font through the script to fix the TTF or OTF. Unfortunately, the
    download link which Adam provided back then does not seem to work any more."
