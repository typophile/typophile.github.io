  body: "It's Calligraphic 421.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/calligraphic-421/\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I understand Nick's frustration. There's no need to post three times; you
    can edit your posts as needed. And also, to echo Mike's request from elsewhere
    on the board, PLEASE think of more detailed names for your posts so we can find
    them again later. If everybody names their posts \"Can you ID this font?\" they
    become impossible to tell from one another.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    match! And, for your suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhen under the gun, it's hard to multitask.
    I couldn't figure how to edit the post!\r\n\r\nYou were so quick to reply....
    thanks again!\r\n\r\nsal"
