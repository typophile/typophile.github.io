    ASSOCIES\" is DIN.\r\nSome similars, far from a good match though: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/words-pictures/flute/|Words+Pictures

  body: "Looks to me like the wordmark is a customized <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?PND\">DIN
    Next Rounded</a>. The stencil aspect was most likely added and the \"M\" was made
    by flipping the \"W\".\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the <a href=\"http://www.sismodesign.com/\">Sismo
    Design</a> website. Click on 'Projets' and then on 'Comment ?' to see the typeface
    used. I'll try again to figure out how to pull the font name from the Flash file."
