body: "hello, I'm a first time poster and ultra-newbie when it comes to typeface.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for a font to use in sending my poems out to journals/mentors.  In looking
  around @ serif fonts, I tend to look for fonts that \"disappear\" when you look
  at them.  I have a few books of poems that I'm using as models.  The two closest
  one's I've found - Garamond and MInion - are vaguely similar to what I'm trying
  to match; but when I compare them closely they are much heavier.  What would be
  perfect is a Minion \"Light,\" if you know what I mean.  Is minion pro different
  and how so?  Thanks for the very interesting forum.  Cheers, ~d "

    HREF="http://gmunch.home.pipeline.com/typo-L/misc/ward.htm">crystal goblet</A>
    sort of context, but then you also refered to "light" in a font-weight term.

      my way around the terminology! \r\n\r\nOn the Crystal Goblet piece:  yes, that's
      what I mean: for my purposes at least, too many fonts seem to draw attention
      to themselves (too much thick/thin, too much angularity) so that my eye catches
      on the font, not the words.  \r\n\r\nMinion seems ideal in this respect - I
      was hoping someone might have suggestions along this line.  The only problem
      with Minion is that I'd like to use something a little lighter in terms of font
      weight.  "

    even Subhead if you want something really delicate (Display would be overkill,
    I think). Of course, this all depends on the quality of printing and the point
    size you'll be setting your poems at: If the letters are too fine, the thins won't
    come out when printed, and that's not the kind of \"disappearing\" you want.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1721.html\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    it might be useful to look for a font that is less condensed, and will create
    a lighter color on the page. It's too late to think of an appropriate example;
    hopefully someone else can come up with one.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\nDavid"

    do. Light oldstyle serif are tricky beasts because they can look anemic. At the
    moment, Jenson Pro Light, Centaur and Bembo is all I can think of.

  body: "I know, you want to go for the crystal goblet. However, it would be useful
    to know roughly what kind of poetry you write. Depending on the subject you treat
    and the form you use, a font like Centaur for example can look terribly misplaced.
    It depends also on the content whether a type face \xABdisappears\xBB. Have you
    ever considered using a monospaced font like Screenplay-Remington? Many editors
    like that: It reminds of typewriter-scripts and it doesn\u2019t look like you
    have tried to do their job.   "

    and for the poem itself, Berkeley Old Style. They worked well together, and the
    client was so delighted we've done 2 more for him that same way.\r\n\r\nI've worked
    with many art directors over the years - and they always loved to remind me --
    there is always a marriage between the type and the art. And in this case, it
    would be between the type and the poetry.\r\n\r\nBest of luck. Let us know what

      is to list my poetry heroes:  Middle English anons., John Skelton, Chaucer,
      John Clare, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, Robert Graves, Robert Frost, and
      Richard Wilbur.  That is, I am or try to be rooted in traditional verse.  As
      for subject matter, I'm with Hardy:  \"What made for poetry 2000 years ago makes
      for poetry now.\"  Hopefully, all this \"places\" me for you without \"catagorizing\"
      (ahhhh!) me.  \r\n\r\nAs to editors, yes I respect what they do very much and
      am not trying to do their job.  When I send poems to an editor in hopes of publishing
      I merely send it in standard garamond.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I also have editors
      & mentors to whom I send poems (either previously published or not) to introduce
      myself, keep them updated as to my work, etc.  And I want it to look really
      good; I know I am preaching to the choir when I say that the typeface/layout
      makes all the difference between something that is pleasurable to read and something
      that is emphatically not!  We all have certain books that we return to merely
      because they are so well designed: the meanings/contents/words almost shimmer.
      \r\n\r\nIf I scan a page of what I'm trying to replicate, would someone be able
      to identify the typeface and so on?  thanks again.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    for text sizes. \r\n\r\nThere is a problem with Palatino looking too heavy in
    text--but it can look fine also. It is a matter of how it is handled--all the
    other features of type layout, as well as the printer. \r\n\r\nIn general, how
    attractive your print-outs will be will depend as much on the typography as the
    typeface you choose. The two go together. If you haven't already, I recommend
    getting a copy of Bringhurst's 'Elements of Typographic Style.' He is a prominent
    poet as well as typographer, and the book will I think just blow you away by its
    eloquence and insight. \r\n"

    were used. Not everyone did it, but when a book was well set, it was always a

      isn't nearly as shimmering (doesn't quite \"sing\" as someone beautifully put

      about letterpress printing and so on, until I saw how expensive that would be
