body: "I found a rather interesting script in the hand of pulp SF writer Ron Hubbard.
  \ Since I have handwritten copies of some of his, shall we say, amateur psychological
  work, I decided to digitise it and make it into a computer font.\r\n\r\nThe edges
  of the letters are a bit ragged and the ink thickness varies from letter to letter--this
  effect is (somewhat) intentional, so as to mimic writing with a biro.  On the other
  hand, the letters slant somewhat erratically (some are written straight up, and
  some with a pronounced slant to the right).  This was unintentional, but I actually
  think it looks good---Hubbard was of the same epoch as the Beat writers and Hunter
  Thompson, with the same proclivities (amphetamine and opiate use mostly).  Do you
  agree?\r\n\r\nI did the kerning and instructions to the best of my ability---if
  someone's got a better idea, now's the time to tell me about it.\r\n\r\nI named
  the font, (sarcasm) how VERY original of me (end sarcasm) \"Ron's Font\" in honour
  of its writer.  \r\n\r\nThe font can be seen here: [[http://www.fontspace.com/nick-matavka/ronsfont]]\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?"
