  on Norway's west coast. To speed up the networking process (finding an apartment
  here can be quite a hazzle) I created a Facebook profile. \r\n\r\nIt seems quite
  a few of you have joined the typophile group over there, but without the nicknames
  I'm having a hard time locating friends and foes. Anyone care to share their real
  names?"

  body: Now... I had to go to your profile just to find your real name. I see there
    are several Frode Hellands on Facebook (seems a common name in Norway) and I don't
    know which one is you. So you will have to find me.
