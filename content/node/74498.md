body: "Hello everyone,\r\nI've been working on a font for a while and I want to take
  it into a development program to become functional.\r\nHowever, I want the shapes
  to be as refined as possible before offering it to the world.\r\n\r\nPlease be critical,
  I am taking all comments into consideration.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/satellite_5925.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  you'd like a closer view of a letter or letters please ask and I can attach additional
  files for critiquing.\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "Great start, Matt!\r\n\r\nA few things at first glance:\r\nLower bowl of
    /B/ could be wider.\r\n/K/ is off balance\r\n/R/ is too narrow\r\n/S/ and /s/
    look upsidedown\r\n/W/ is a little wide\r\ndescenders on /p/, /q/ and /y/ are
    too long\r\n\r\nI myself have recently started drawing type in [[http://www.fontlab.com/|FontLab]],
    a really great tool, I can recommend it. Consider this software before 'finishing'
    the design in some other programme, after which you'll have to import all glyphs
    into FontLab (or similar software) anyway.\r\n\r\nKeep going!\r\n"
