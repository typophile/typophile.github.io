  slogan \"Let's get it done\". It seems like Citibank is also using a new font(?).
  It's not the OCRK Bold Square everyone was talking about. For example...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.citibank.com/us/d.htm\r\nThe
  font of the words \"Banking/Credit Cards/Lines & Loans/Investing/Planning\" near
  the top.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFOQrOd9E2g\r\nThe font
  at the end of the slogan \"Let's get it done\".\r\n\r\nWhat is the font?\r\n\r\nThanks!!"
