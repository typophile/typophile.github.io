body: "Working on a job for a corporate client. In one sentence there are two words
  inside parentheses, and both words must be italic. Should the parentheses also be
  italic? \r\n\r\nThe copywriter isn't sure. My guess is that they shouldn't be italic,
  but I'm not sure if there's a rule that applies."

  body: "If the rest of the sentence is not italic, the parentheses should not be
    italic.\r\n\r\n(Some typographers never use italic parentheses and brackets, even
    if the entire context is italic. But if you do italicize them, their style is
    dictated by the surrounding sentence, just like quote marks. Also roman parentheses
    just look nicer.)"

  body: 'Independent of context, it''s often smart to end emphasis at a word space.
    The reason is to avoid potential collisions and big holes in the spacing (ex:
    collision when italic ascending letter is followed by a roman question mark; gap
    when italics are followed by a roman period.) Also, punctuation usually doesn''t
    carry as much meaning as words do. Try reading the text and see for yourself what
    the different solutions communicate.'
