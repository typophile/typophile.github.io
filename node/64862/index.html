  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have to make an ID guideline book, and I used a font that is called "IncisSlab East".
My problem is, that I searched over the internet for this font, but I have no result. :(
I think, something is wrong with the font naming.

What is very similar with this font is "Antique Olive" (what I found in my system). But it's not the same, because it's bolder then "Incis".

Sombody can help me? what could be the real name of the type (Incis)?
attached is an image

Is IncisSlab East exist? or... is a fake Antique Olive?

		<div class="commentbody">It seems to be an obvious 'clone' of Antique Olive, perhaps a slight weight modification, or maybe nothing more than a renaming of another weight. The [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antique-olive/|URW version of Antique Olive]] has quite a few weights, including a Light.

You are right!
thanx:)

This "Incis" is the same with the URW Antique Olive (Antique Olive T Light) version.
And what I found at the myfonts.com is "Incised 901"(???)
    
Incised 901
* Publisher: Tilde
* Design owner: Bitstream
* MyFonts debut: May 27, 2008

URW Antique Olive
* Publisher: URW++
* Design owner: Fonderie Olive
* MyFonts debut: Mar 31, 2001

		<div class="commentbody">Bitstream was the company that originally digitized many older typefaces for foundries that at that time did not have the capability. Apparently one of the terms of their agreement with these foundries was that they could retain and market the design if they renamed it. Incised 901 is their name for Antique Olive. Tilde has apparently gotten into an arrangement with Bitstream where Tilde produces versions of these for extended language support (Florian explained this recently, I believe). URW, with their Ikarus system, was also one of the early digitizers, and by similar arrangement with other foundries they also marketed font designs by new names. For example, URW Palladio, and Paltus Antiqua were both names for URW versions of Palatino. Neither of these companies are stealing fonts, if that was your thought.
