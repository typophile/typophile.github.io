    of the serifs are trailing away on the site.\r\n\r\nWhile you're at it, you might
    like Didoni, Carousel or Fat Face. And I believe Cabernet Swash has a similar
    ampersand.\r\n\r\n"

    for so many posts, but until the editing bug is fixed\u2014which drives every
    revision to the bottom of the list\u2014this is the sad price we must pay. :-D"
