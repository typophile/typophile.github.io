body: "For your delight & entertainment: a Font Viewer. \"Not another one!\" I hear
  you cry. Well, this one I wrote especially to examine OpenType features. Drag any
  font onto it and it will tell you if it found an OpenType substitution table. If
  so, a mere press of the F5 key pops up a window where you can browse the features
  at leisure. It uses FreeType to display glyphs, so it should be able to load just
  about any file type there is; however, I've dismembered it to read only PFB, TTF,
  OTF and TTC (first font only for that one).\r\n\r\nDownload the tiny zip (282K)
  from [[http://www.jongware.com/binaries/seefont_1_0.zip|my website]] and start a-draggin'
  those fonts onto it.\r\n\r\nA few caveats follow right after these pretty pictures.\r\n\r\nThe
  main screen. Move Cursor to see all glyphs, with glyph names if available, AGL names
  if not, unicode point if there isn't one, and glyph id as last resort.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seefont1_5081.PNG]\r\n\r\nPress
  F5 to browse through OpenType features. Those numbers \"#188\" and so on are glyph
  ids (this is Calibri, which doesn't contain names).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seefont2_4934.PNG]\r\n\r\nPress
  F2 to see which Unicode blocks are covered (partially) by the font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seefont3_5427.PNG]\r\n\r\nOkay,
  here come the caveats.\r\n<ul><li>It works just fine on my old Windows machine.
  Do not try on a Mac. I'm not sure about Vista.</li>\r\n<li>No GPOS support. Difficult
  to program in. Check your kerning and spacing case somewhere else.</li>\r\n<li>Not
  all substitution types are supported, specifically Contextual ones. A pity, because
  these are always interesting to check out, but it is <em>hideously</em> difficult.</li>\r\n<li>Some
  fonts take <em>ages</em> to load. Arial Unicode, for example, takes many many seconds.
  Apple's LastResort.ttf takes a quarter of an hour. Really!</li>\r\n<li>Some fonts
  are displayed at what seems double size, mostly CJK fonts it seems. I have ta think
  about that.</li>\r\n<li>At startup it tries to locate the Windows/Fonts folder for
  its interface font: Calibri, if not found Arial. If neither is found, you don't
  have text in the main view.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe good news is you can also use
  it as a font browser: press Page Up and Page Down to browse the folder the last
  font was found in (i.e., <em>first</em> drag any font onto it, <em>then</em> browse).
  You can also right-click a font file once (not in the Windows' font folder), select
  \"Open With...\" and browse once for the proggy. That'll insert it in the font type's
  \"Open With\" list. Don't set it as default -- I can't imagine what'll happen. Perhaps
  your hard disk will be erased.\r\n\r\nIf you are browsing, you can press F4 to see
  a list of all supported font files in the current directory. Don't press F1 -- it
  does not supply help (who needs that anyway) but pops up an old dialog I forgot
  to take out :-). Press F3 to sort by Glyph Id; as mentioned before, press F5 for
  the OpenType features. Press Control+G to jump immediately to a glyph number; press
  Control+F to find a glyph by name.\r\n\r\nNo worries. No problem. No guarantees."

    you try using HarfBuzz to render the OpenType Layout? HarfBuzz and FreeType should
    work together nicely. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\nThe program does not \"use\" Opentype features -- you cannot
    'test drive' a font, switching options on and off to see what happens.\r\nAt the
    mo', I'm not interested in actually <em>rendering</em> OpenType, but more in how
    the features are written. That's what the program attempts to display.\r\n\r\n(I
    could take a look at the HarfBuzz code though, check how the hideously difficult
    bits were done.)"

  body: "I should mention I'm thoroughly depressed by DTL's freeware OTMaster Lite
    (as announced on [[http://typophile.com/node/53989|Typophile]] -- to examine OTF
    features, <em>that</em> is the tool (and the full version to edit them). So I
    didn't bother to add more OTF viewing caps.\r\nAh -- that should be \"impressed\"
    :-)\r\n\r\nHowever, to take just a quick look at any vector font file, it's a
    nice little proggie isn't it?"
