  body: "Mike, I think 'Rock It' looks like a grunged House Gothic, but it doesn't
    really match the 'Never Miss' sample. Look at the E, which is not symmetrical.
    I suppose you could 'manufacture' one using the Rock It/House Gothic F& E. And
    the V looks like an inverted N. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I think Mike F nailed it with <em>Rock It!</em>.  All the letters match (down
    to the dirt), <em>Rock It! - deluxe</em> from the same page is another story though.
