body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Upright1_4440.png]\r\n\r\nThis is a typeface
  I've been working on for about a month. It is supposed to make anything set in it
  seem amusingly outdated, which would give infographics a touch of irony. \r\n\r\nI
  would like some critique on this font. As you can tell from the name, this font
  should be tall and serious, but I would also like it to be a tiny bit goofy at the
  same time (I feel the G, f, t, and y bring this part out), and I think something
  is off in the proportions of the upper case."

    ascenders."

  body: "Are the uppercase and lowercase stem widths identical? I think the uppercase
    looks too light.\r\n\r\nThe curves in \"ghmnpqr\" look bumpy. \"s\" is malformed,
    too wide and fat. \"w\" is to wide and fat. Both X-es need some modulation. \"4\"
    crossbar too high."

  body: "Extremely tight letterspacing (see lMmNn) seems to be quite the fashion among
    young (?) designers these days. My awkward feeling towards it comes from the fact
    that inevitable gaps with the slanted strokes of v, w, x, k etc. stand out even
    more. Also r and t in this font. The word \"Inappropriate\" looks unbalanced to
    me with its white space.\r\n\r\nAndreas"
