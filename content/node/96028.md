    intended to produce new designs, rather than see what works best out of the many
    faces already existing. That doesn't make a lot of sense.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe most
    well-known form of dyslexia is that which confuses letters like p and q, or b
    and d. Except for fonts especially designed for dyslexics, hardly any <em>text</em>
    fonts avoid nearly complete symmetry between the two.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is
    a specialized requirement, and that new things have been discovered about dyslexia
    recently, it's not that surprising that the simplest route from research on dyslexia
    to a typeface which reflects that up-to-date research would be to design one.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it <em>is</em> also true that there are out there some ransom-note typefaces,
    for example, in which every letter is absolutely unique. This should meet the
    needs of dyslexics, but then there is no uniformity to the line of text, so normal
    readers are slowed.\r\n\r\nThere's also the problem that if one uses typeface
    X as a way to differentiate between p and q, and so on, the difference is a peculiarity
    of that typeface, rather than a convention that could be used on a host of typefaces
    (since presumably we ultimately want to make the whole world safe for dyslexics,
    not merely one set of textbooks).\r\n\r\nI see that Hobo is symmetric; Rustikalis
    DT has the required asymmetry, but it is much too noisy and illegible.\r\n\r\nBut
    I finally found one p/q and b/d asymmetric font that's also reasonably legible
    after a cursory web search: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/cherry-lane/|Cherry
    Lane]] by Jonahfonts.\r\n\r\nSo we can save the world's dyslexics by making this
    typeface more overused than Papyrus, Comic Sans, Hobo, and Times Roman put together!\r\n\r\nIf
    a subtle distinction is sufficient, there is perhaps Egyptian 710 from Bitstream.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I see that there's the Open Dyslexic font available for free download. (There's
    also Lexia Readable, but licensing is required for commercial use.) - but in both
    of these, the p/q and b/d distinction doesn't seem blatant enough for a purpose-designed
    face.\r\n\r\nSassoon seems like a worthy candidate for consideration, as here
    the asymmetry is, in my opinion,  sufficient - even though the page where I saw
    it somewhat dismisses it as just for children. Cherry Lane, after all, being a
    display face, is worse in that sense.\r\n\r\nHmm... there's also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/smeltery/sans-merci/|Sans
    Merci]], or even [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/lazybones/|Lazybones]]."

    we read, we jump ahead to a certain chunk of space, which the fovea can capture.
    This may have one or more words or no word. And when we jump maybe the parafovea
    gives us an idea of where to jump. This eating of text in eye sized bites that
    may or may not isolate one word is probably why word space are so helpful. \r\n\r\nIn
