  body: "It seems to have a lot of similarities to Bernase Roman, but there are many
    differences too. The most obvious differences are the e, g, and y. Image Club
    used to have a version of this, and it was also shown in the 'Homage to the Alphabet'
    book from Phil's Photo. It had an alternate 'a' like your sample, and many of
    the other letters are very similar, including the 's' and 'c'. I will scan the
    sample and post it in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Oh, since I did scan Bernase Roman, here it is. The only digital version
    of Trooper Roman I could find was ParaType's <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Troover.htm\">Troover</a>.
    The ParaType version does not use all the same alternates that were used in the
    posted sample, but the full typeface is also shown in the 'Homage to the Alphabet'
    book. It would take a bit to restart my computer so I can make the scan and then
    post it again, but I would do that if anyone want's proof (Yves).\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/4835\">This thread</a> discussed
    Trooper and showed a sample of it that matched this posted Report font. It also
    mentions FontBank <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/talon.htm\">Talon</a>,
    which I have and that's why it looked so familiar.\r\n\r\nOh the designers were
    not the same, apparently. 'Bernase Roman' was designed for ITC by Tom Carnase
    and Ron Bonder; 'Trooper Roman' was done by Dave Trooper, according to Mark's
    information. I have to say somebody was 'inspired' by somebody -- those have too
    many similarities. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    go away now and make a scan of the font shown in the Phil's Photo book. It's quite
    possible though, that FontBank Talon was used. It seems like a match to me, based
    on a quick look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
