body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nWe've recently moved aboard our sailboat. I've been
  trying to ID the type used for the name everywhere, and haven't had any luck. It
  seems familiar, but can't quite recall where I've seen it. No critiques on the type
  itself, please :)\r\n\r\nI trust one of you experts will know it straight away.
  \r\n\r\nMuch appreciate any advice.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nTrev\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dosia-big_6176.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_8560_6402.jpg]"
