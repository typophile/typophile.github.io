  body: Some weeks ago it was the 50th birthday of Helvetica. A lot of very famous
    type designers were there and agreed that the original form of the Helvetica medium
    (the Haas Helvetica) was really missing because of a poor digitalization. It's
    kinda interesting because you can easly find some old letraset of this Haas Helvetica
    and I do own a lot of them. There are some little differences between the Haas
    and the Lynotype version like the non parallelism of the endings, a better lowercase
    a bowl and a lot of other detalis that makes it look better than the actual one.
    I wanted to digitalize it by myself but for the moment I don't have the time and
    the experience to do so. I hope someday the Haas Helvetica medium will come back!

  body: "Thanks for sharing this, Duncan. There's a lot of Helvetica bashing going
    on on this site & although I have to admit it's probably the most common & overused
    font, I'm still a big fan. It's been around for 50 years & there has to be a reason
    for that... After 50 years it still doesn't look one bit outdated & you just have
    to admire its neutral appearance. Sure, it might be a little \"misused\" in terms
    of an easy answer for any kind of design, but that's exactly where its beauty
    lies; it c\xE0n't really be misused in any design because it's so universal. Great
    font, great link!"

  body: "Duncan,\r\nwould you like to add some pictures of lead Helvetica, Folio and/or
    Walbaum?\r\n\r\nThe standard of lead what was and is used by the foundries:\r\n5-6
    Sn\r\n28-29 Sb\r\n\r\nBut Monotype used less Antimon:\r\n8,5-9,5 Sn\r\n18,5-19,5
    Sb\r\nAnd therefore Monotype types look \"cheap\".\r\n\r\nSn (Stannum) Zinn\r\nSb
    (Stibium) Antimon\r\nPb (Plumbum) Lead\r\n\r\nSo the Walbaum of Berthold from
    1922 looks much more better the Monotype one does:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/walbaum_5980.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    D. Stempel AG used more Antimon for Helvetica (and Lithographia) to make it harder
    and more metallic looking:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helv_3733.jpg]\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: "This is in response to kuroneko \u2013 I too personally believe that the
    initial cut of Die Neue Haas Grotesk by Max Miedinger has (or had) a certain charm
    that the following designs simply failed to carry, for whatever reason \u2013
    technical or otherwise.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a compilation of the letter pair \u201Cca\u201D
    of Helveticas I\u2019ve come across and spent some time examining. Please note
    that I haven\u2019t included versions of Monotype Imaging (CG Triumvirate), ParaType
    (Pragmatica), Bitstream (Swiss 721) and many many more. Corrections/modifications/additions
    welcome!\r\n\r\nTo me, Christian Schwartz\u2019 Haas Neue Grotesk is the hottest
    thing ever, which TOO is now controlled by Linotype.\r\n\r\nRG\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ca_4042.JPG]"
