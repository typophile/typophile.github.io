  body: It's strange to have a dollop terminal on a [[Didone]] 'W'. I don't think
    it's from any typeface. Not a professional one at least.

  body: Is there another term for "dollop terminal?" There have been other times I've
    wanted to refer to such a thing.

  body: Only in that it's a word that is not obvious to the layman as is "teardrop"
    or "dollop".
