    Caslon 224</a> is slightly less contrasty than Graphique, so Graphique is still
    a better match.

  body: "I don't see why it can't be ITC Caslon No. 224. The sample looks like that
    face to me, and there's a good circumstantial case for it, too.\r\n\r\nSam Antupit
    (1932-2003) redesigned Harper's in 1984, right after Lewis Lapham took over as
    editor. Lapham is still involved with the magazine, and they still follow Antupit's
    basic design. [At least as far as I can remember \u2014 I was a subscriber then
    and was very impressed with the new look.]\r\n\r\nWhat was available to Antupit
    then? Ed Benguiat designed ITC Caslon No. 224 in '83, so it was very current.
    It was also not designed as a digital typeface. We shouldn't assume that Harper's
    is using a later digital version, which is what the type foundry websites show.
    \ Couldn't they be using the original version of the ITC face, or even a customized
    display version that Benguiat did for them?\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about the
    magazine business to definitely answer these questions, but maybe they just held
    on to archaic production methods as well as the '83 redesign.  Harper's almost
    went out of business in 1980 and was rescued by philanthropists who established
    a charitable foundation to operate the magazine. They just may not have the bucks
    to overhaul design and production. [Not that I think they need to.]\r\n\r\nO.K.,
    it's late, and I still need to check out awfulplasticsurgery.com before I go to
    bed.\r\n\r\nTheir website lists Stacey D. Clarkson as the current AD, but I couldn't
    see a way to send her an e-mail. Coles, call her up!"
