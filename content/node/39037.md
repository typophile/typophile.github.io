body: "Hi again, \r\n\r\nHere's one for a company named Techlink that is owned and
  operated by a single female. She said it doesn't need to reflect her femininity
  too much, but a little is ok. She did say that it should look serious enough for
  her to be taken seriously, and she asked me to ask you guys if the logo reflects
  what her business offers: The company does installations of internet, networks,
  firewalls, security, etc. \r\n\r\nCheers in advance for your very handy tips![img:sites/default/files/old-images/TL-square-1_6237.png]\r\n\r\nps.
  linotype zapfino for the t and vectora light for the TECHLINK\r\npps. her slogan
  is \"IT Solutions\", but I can't think where to place that slogan with regard to
  the rest of the logo, and what colour/font, etc. any tips?"

    with the same concept, here's option two. I'm open to completely changing the
    concept though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TL-square-2_6257.png]"

    for what you have, I think it accomplishes the 'little bit but not too much' femininity
    angle.\r\n\r\nBut, it's not really doing a whole lot for me...especially the 'techlink'
    type which doesn't have much personality.\r\n\r\nI'd downplay the size relation
    too. Try a smaller 't' and larger type and play with some other faces for the
    'techlink' name."
