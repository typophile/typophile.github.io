  \ Well, I say \"we\" but it was used in the past for promotional materials for a
  church I serve now, and I wasn't around when it was used.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be greatly appreciated!  I included the \"WhatTheFont\" tags after uploading this
  to their website.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "I looked through about 1500 freebie handwritten fonts and the closest I found
    to this was [[http://www.dafont.com/surrendered-heart.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Family+Bible+Church|Surrendered
    Heart]] by Kimberley Geswein. It's possible it's a commercial font, though I doubt
    it. It could also be a 'personal' font that anyone who can print letters can have
    made for for as little as $10, so it may be that the best we can do is name something
    similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, Mike!  I felt like I was losing my mind on this one.  It is definitely
    a unique font, it could be a custom font, but it was originally used about five
    years ago and I'm not sure how easy it was to do that back then.  For all I know
    it could have been hand lettered and scanned as an image to be used in publications.\r\n\r\nSurrendered
    Heart may be as close as we get (and close enough to \"switch to\" if everyone
    agrees.  Again, thanks for your expertize."
