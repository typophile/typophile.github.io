  body: Yes, probably hand drawn given the different 'O's. The shapes made me think
    of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/device_fonts/absinthe/">Absinthe</a>
    tho that is more art nouveau than tiki.

  body: It could be a typeface (and the differences due to overprint), but probably
    it wasn't digitised.

  body: Yeah, I that's what I thought. I'm still interested in the font's name, though.

  body: "I looked in some old Photo-Lettering catalogs and nothing looked particularly
    close. It's hard to define this style, because it has Art Nouveau-like curves,
    yet the S is not very typical of Nouveau lettering I have seen. Stephen mentioned
    'tiki' and I guess I see that, but I couldn't find many examples that were not
    the current crop of digital ones.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "

  body: Right, it's not quite Art Noveau. I can imagine it in a horror-context with
    its pointy corners.
