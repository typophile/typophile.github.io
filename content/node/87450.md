  font software that allows these 4 font styles to be created, preferably free font
  software or free online font software.  \r\n\r\nThe font software should also allow
  this font file naming convention / allow flexibility in font file naming:\r\n[name]-Regular.ttf\r\n[name]-Bold.ttf\r\n[name]-Italic.ttf\r\n[name]-BoldItalic.ttf"

  body: Any automated solution is going to produce spotty results, at best, especially
    when generating pseudo-italics. Slanting type changes the sidebearings on most
    characters and tends to create spacing issues, which generally need to be resolved
    manually.

  body: If you only need the four styles, because the Ereader does not accept font
    families with less than four members, you could simply copy the regular style
    three times and just change the internal names and some other values. All the
    four styles would look the same. You could use TTX or FontForge for this.

  body: "TTX is quite a program though difficult to get it started on Windows.  @
    Arno Enslin has posted on Typophile about this.   I even tried it on Fedora Linux.
    \ I am not a techie.  I wanted to find that start icon or file to get it going
    and it was not easy, just could not do it.\r\n\r\nFontForge was easy to get on
    Fedora Linux because it is also free software and was usable opposite to TTX.
    \ I tried on it though I felt it was confusing as I only a newbie and a non-techie.\r\n\r\nSo
    if either Arno Enslin or someone who is a font expert with TTX or FontForge and
    has a few minutes to spare please could you do the @ Arno Enslin recommendation
    for these 2 fonts for US Dollar 20 please:\r\n\r\nhttp://ia700302.us.archive.org/17/items/BbtFont/\r\nhttp://ia600302.us.archive.org/18/items/RailModelFont_971/\r\n\r\n\r\n

    without internal TTX/FontForge name changes.  I am able to view the font on the
    most of the files that came with it except one dictionary which in the end offered
    the deleting option (bit odd).  I will need to view downloaded electronic texts
    to research further.\r\n\r\nThis font http://ia600302.us.archive.org/18/items/RailModelFont_971/
    was not doable on the eReader for some reason."
