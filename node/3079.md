body: I&#39;m designing my portfolio site for English and Japanese users. I&#39;ve
  been studying japanese for about 6 months and it&#39;s just occurred to me I&#39;ve
  only a handful of Japanese kanji fonts and no idea even of how many exist. <BR>
  <BR>For anyone familiar with the language they&#39;ll know there are three alphabets,
  kanji is the one with thousands of characters, does anyone know how extensive the
  range of kanji fontsets is? We&#39;re used to choosing between thousands of fonts
  in the west but do graphic designers in Japan just have a handful of kanji fonts
  to choose between? <BR> <BR>Anyone know any good font resources, retaliers where
  I can browse a good range and get an idea of what&#39;s available? <BR> <BR>Thanks

    <BR>There&#39;s the <a href="http://www.typeproject.com/"> Axis Project</a>. It
    is very nice, and there&#39;s <BR>even a Latin companion designed by Akira Kobayashi.
