  assessment tests. The restrictions are:\r\n\r\n1. They need to be in english\r\n2.
  They need to be for people who speak english as a first language\r\n3. It must be
  for people at the university level (though I have come across several references
  to \"adult reading\" as being grade 8)\r\n4. They must be approximately 700 words
  in length each\r\n5. The hard part, they need to come from the same source.\r\n\r\nSo
  far, SAT prep tests and the Nelson-Denny are the best sources I have come across.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone recommend others please?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nPS, I am new here. How
  do I go back and check old posts I have made in the past?"
