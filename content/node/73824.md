  lurking on this lively forum for a while.\r\nLearned a lot and been amazed by your
  ID magic and type knowledge.\r\n\r\nHere I need your help ID two typefaces in this
  logo.\r\n1. AIA\r\n2. CONTINUING EDUCTAION (which I got Scout Cond Regular close
  but not really a match)\r\n\r\nAppreciate your help!\r\n\r\nbuco"
