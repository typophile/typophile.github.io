  Ongarato Design]] for the <i>The Capitol</i> which feels like it has been inspired
  a bit too much by another custom typeface\u2014<i>Twin</i> by Mark El-Khatib.\r\n\r\nThe
  logotype\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_84.jpg\">\r\n\r\nTwin\r\n<img

  guess conceptually this kind of double-line typeface isn't new, it's been popular
  probably since the letraset types of the '70s but visually Mark El-Khatib's typeface
  is quite distinct, the way the lines loop and cross over is something pretty unique
  in the canon of contemporary type design isn't it?  The designer has tried to change
  it, however, in the text <i>South Yarra</i> it's quite clear there is a big relationship
  between the logotype and Twin.\r\n\r\nWhat are you opinions fellow typophiles? Is
  this plagiarism? Or inspiration?"

  body: "Not plagiarism, and maybe not even inspired. It's easy to see how both designers
    could reach this solution independent of each other. I think El-Khatib's is better,
    of course.\r\n\r\nBTW, I was under the impression that this typeface was by <a
    href=\"http://www.jameslangdonwork.net/\">James Langdon</a>. Maybe co-authored?"

  body: Ahh, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150163445787707.305039.106708872706">here's
    the answer</a> to my question. The typeface is by El-Khatib, the identity design
    by Langdon.

  body: "I'm a bit reluctant to comment - it seems bad form to make a judgement without
    knowing all of the facts - IMHO there <em>is</em> quite a strong connection between
    the two designs, but just how significant is that?\r\n\r\nIt's not unusual for
    persons involved to turn up on Typophile to comment."

  body: "Of course, maybe the difference between plagiarism and inspiration is fairness?
    (which is relative...)\r\n\r\nThat would be very welcomed\u2014to have the designers
    provide their own side of the story.\r\n\r\nI think what makes me lean towards
    seeing it as a direct inspiration (and maybe too much) is the fact that the Twin
    typeface has been in use and appearing on many design blogs as early as [[http://www.mottodistribution.com/site/?p=7420|July
    2010]], whilst The Capitol identity appeared locally only early this year...\r\n\r\nIt
    also seems too convenient that only the C, O and I (although you couldn't really
    do that character differently) are exactly the same in their construction (the
    word, The Capitol is in a different style obviously but uses the same construction)
    as if the they were trying to avoid being <strong>exactly</strong> the same. I'm
    speculating here of course..."
