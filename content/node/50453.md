  Notice the Chalet silhouette used out of turn. Sick and Sad:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/M_IMAGE_5184.11beb4b9125.93.88.fa.d0.10b932748.jpg.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nwcn.com/statenews/washington/stories/NW_101308WAB_girl_teen_abuse_LJ.10b837de0.html"

    don't see the problem with it, personally. Is there a certain way the Chalet Silhouettes
    should be used? It's a pretty random assortment of clip art: an Eames chair, an
    M16, the Arc de Triomphe, the Space Shuttle, a poodle,  a gallon of milk, etc.
    , etc. Chalet is a lovely typeface, but I'm not sure what the silhouettes have
    to do with the typeface itself."
