I would like to familiarize myself with sans fonts (I seem to have a problem with differentiation of sans), so much so that I can recognize them and name them and, hopefully, know what my designs need in a more timely fashion. Can you please tell me different ways to familiarize myself with them, besides use of course, that can better train my eye? Thank you so much for your help, as always. I am a sponge-impart your wisdom!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A little history wouldn't hurt.
Many of the types used today have been around a while, and have interesting cultural connections.
For instance, Chris Burke's book "Renner" shows how the circumstances of Paul Renner's life came together to inform the design of Futura. So you start to get an idea of why the designer made the letters the shapes they are, and what you see in a letter shape becomes a microcosm, full of meaning.

Suitcase will work well for organizing your fonts. I use FEX because it works well for my purposes, and is free.

As to understanding the history of the types, it will also help you as a designer because you will then understand the original intended use, the philosophical outlook of the era in which the type came from, etc. Not that you have to only use type for their original purposes, but it certainly helps to know the context of where a font came from so you can contrast it or understand its use.

(For an example of that, look at the thread about the [[http://typophile.com/node/55323|Rocky Mountain News nameplate]] where Nick explains the choice of Minion vs. the standard newspaper font.)</div>

I'm not sure what it means. As Janet observes, there seems to be some debate as to whether the prefix is taxonomic (denoting physical features) or phylogenetic (denoting evolutionary provenance).

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>Doesn’t “neo” refer to the humanist features in an otherwise grotesque design?</cite>

Neo-grotesque refers to the intentional removal of idiosyncrasies and humanist features from the pre-1957 grotesques. The most obvious example, horizontal stroke terminals throughout, appears in all three of the original neo-grotesques, Helvetica, Folio, and Univers. The inward turns of terminals found in the British grotesques disappears, as do most examples of asymmetric stroke widths such as those found in the Benton gothics. The design of the neo-grotesques is also a function of the way the counter spaces can seem to lock the letters into place and vice-versa (see Mike Parker’s interview in Helvetica).

Some of the old grotesques have been redesigned, and more added, since 1957, incorporating features of the neo-grotesques (such as Lange’s redesign of Akzidenz). So when the term is applied outside of that very specific historical context, its meaning starts to fall apart.</div>

That is indeed the way that the term is understood by some people, but it's overblown.
Helvetica and Folio are traditional grotesques, nicely and consistently executed, that's all.
All the features considered to be Neo were already present in the 24 pt size of Akzidenz Grotesk, prior to Helvetica &c.
We don't call new, slicker versions of other historical genres Neo (e.g. 20th century Bodonis are not Neo-didone).
But for historical reasons, certain mid-20th century grotesques get the nod.

Better fix the Wiki, James!

Well, nothing is ever exactly the same way twice, but I think "neo-" says much more about history (something that was around before is now around again) than about form. The newness of neoclassicism in interior design, as an example, says to me not "this is a new kind of classicism, different from the old classical art" but rather "this is classicism again (like the old classical art), different from the Rococo styles that preceded it."

That leaves open to argument the applicability of "neo-" here - it would seem to me to hinge on how fair it would be to say that other non-grotesques (Gill, German geometrics) had eclipsed the older grotesques in the 30s and 40s so that the use of those grotesques (and cleaned-up manifestations like Helvetica etc.) in the 50s was "new." </div>

They were all present in plenty of typefaces. But they were not all carefully worked into the entire font to produce the dramatically regimented designs that made the neo-grotesques an innovation—for example, in the 24-point AG terminals are a mix of angles and horizontals and the widths of b, d, p and q create counters that create a less monotonous color. There is something new and special in the neo-grotesque faces—a Swiss obsession with regulation that borders on psychotic.</div>

Leveraging nationalistic stereotypes in a typeface: that's how Haas Standard was marketed as Helvetica, puffing up its attributes.

There were many polished grotesques produced in Europe during the 1950s and 60s which may be considered part of the International Style. Univers and Folio were somewhat more original than Helvetica. But all in all, there's not a huge amount to distinguish them from types of the traditional grotesque genre that had never gone out of commission, such as Monotype Grotesque (1930s, English, with single-storey "g" and a beautifully smooth and designy Light weight well suited to the International Style). Futura and Gill Sans, the paragons of the Geometric and Humanist classes of sans serif, were formally far more innovative, as would be Frutiger, which is yet to be named to the head of its class.

Nina is onto something with mention of phototype. The fact that the discreet detailing of the Neo-grotesques is their distinguishing feature may well be a result of media convergence at that time, when new types were being produced for a variety of technologies, with the qualities of understatement that looked slick and professional in display media (typositor, dry transfer, &c.) transporting to text. 

Here's Akzidenz Grotesk from the 1954 Berthold specimen:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AG_4583.jpg]

The smaller fonts have the funky terminals James refers to; the larger sizes are more consistently detailed. Note how the angled terminal of "e" in the 20 pt gets perpendicular in the 24 pt.

Clean it up, increase the x-height, and voilà the neo-grotesque Helvetica. Twenty years later American designers did the same thing for some old faces at ITC (Garamond, Cheltenham, &c.) 

In the 1980s Headliners International prefixed all their Font names with "Neo-", and trademarked it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I suspect that the "Neo-Grotesque" wave, at least originally here in Switzerland, was heavily triggered both by the advent of phototype (which made it so much easier / more cost-effective to produce new fonts), and the grotesque-heavy Swiss Style, which seemed to suggest a huge market for such types &ndash; which in fact wasn't really there at first.
As Hans Neuburg wrote in Neue Grafik (No. 4, December 1959, p. 54; my translation):
<cite>"Nobody will seriously deny the necessity of designing typefaces that satisfy the beliefs of our times, as long as they constitute a meaningful expansion and enhancement of the existing inventory. However, it is questionable if this necessity also extends to the design and release of such a large number of grotesque types in the 'old style', and if this makes sense from an economic perspective (not addressing the issue of originality at all)… The experiences the foundries have made so far, as well as current and past design trends, rather seem to hint at self-imposed limitation [in terms of the number of typefaces used]."</cite></div>

Seems like a lot of foundries had the same idea at the same time.
Was Neuberg suggesting restrictive trade practice -- a cartel?

Nonetheless, by 1977 Haas was ready to take another shot at the genre with Unica.

That would surprise me &ndash; I read that as a comment on how very deeply rooted Akzidenz Grotesk was in the original "Swiss" style of design. It seems like a number of designers back in 1957 were a bit perplexed at the sudden repertoire of new grotesques, and some maintained they were so happy with Akzidenz they weren't really in that dire a need of alternatives. Karl Gerstner was quoted in TM 2 in February 1972 (!) as saying, "That feature of Akzidenz which is sometimes criticized as 'imbalance', we see as its biggest merit: its liveliness, its (literally) original freshness." Neuburg too, incidentally, appears to have been a huge fan of AG, calling it "one of the cleanest (!) and most noble grotesques".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi all! Okay, so I'm hard at work studying all of your great suggestions. I've played all of the great font games, read almost all of the articles, just received my font book so I can read it "on the can", and am the only psycho-woman at my gym comparing sans font specimens while walking on the treadmill. I would like to know if anyone knows of a font site that lets you compare fonts side by side? Also, if there is a font site that pairs examples text and display? Sort of like, if you like this, you might want to try this?, type of thing? As always, thank you. </div>

There might be something like this in English too: In German there's a fun little <a href="http://www.typografie.de/Unsere-Buecher/Typografie/Wiebke-Hoeljes/Dreiklaenge-SchriftMischMusterbuch::145.html">sample book titled "Dreiklänge"</a> ("triads"). Each page has a headline plus two blocks of text set in the same font, but then all the pages are cut into thirds, so just leafing through, you can combine the samples in all kinds of different ways (headline/text/text). Doesn't contain a huge lot of fonts though, more like "classics"/well-known ones.</div>

Janet, this probably won't be much help, but Will Harris's site has a page that lists pairs of sans serifs and serifs that work well together: <a href="http://www.will-harris.com/typepairs.htm">Typefaces that work together</a>. Unfortunately, it doesn't let you see samples of the faces! That's the drawback.

<a href="http://new.myfonts.com/">MyFonts</a> lets you see typefaces that are similar to the one you're looking at, but does not match display with text.</div>
