    body: ITC seem to have the family. I remember disliking this font hugely many
      years ago, and avoiding it if possible. It has got better!

  body: "<em>> ITC seem to have the family.</em>\r\n\r\nFrom the latest instalment
    of Bald Condensed:\r\n<em>\"(...) I\u2019d like to quickly point you all to another
    typeface often requested on the Typophile Type Identification Board that has finally
    made the transition to digital. Bookman Swash \u2014 not the wimpy blandified
    ITC version, but \u201Cthe swashy original\u201D \u2014 is boasted by Veer to
    be \u201Cthe most comprehensive digital revival of the original \u201970s delicacy\u201D.
    Although I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to test it, Jason Walcott\u2019s Jukebox
    Bookman looks like it\u2019s the real deal. It has all the vintage traits of the
    original Bookman \u2014 moderate x-height, higher contrast, obliques instead of
    italics \u2014 and the alternates are simply swashalicious.\"</em>\r\n\r\nIn other
    words, the ITC Version is not very good. :^/"
