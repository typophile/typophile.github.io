body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm developing a suite of icons for use by an organisation.
  The majority are generic symbols from public domain or developed by me, while others
  are TM logos or symbols such as word, powerpoint, PDF logo, Facebook etc. It's these
  kinds of proprietary symbols that have me scratching my head. \r\n\r\nAny advice
  from someone who has been through a similar situation? I would normally seek permission
  from the company, but I'm unsure about even the language or terms I should use or
  whether I would run into a brick wall etc. I'm tempted to develop a suite of generic
  symbols which try and represent these icons without reproducing them but that seems
  a little counter-intuative or something.\r\n\r\nAny help would be well appreciated.
  Thanks for reading.\r\n"

    symbols in your own font or vector art could be problematic if the material you
    are creating is distributed externally, particularly if the logo is used or associated
    with material that could be perceived negatively and reflect negatively on that
    logo. They are likely to be protected by intellectual property laws and if you
    are in doubt at this point it is definitely worth contacting the relevant corporate
    entities to seek permission.\r\n\r\nIn the past I have created a font using a
    version of a company logo but this was done in conjunction with the relevant company
    and has resulted in a unique dual copyright (specifically for that font, not the
    logo itself) and a series of agreements around permissions for using that font."

    a good word processor (or presentation software) icon will be more useful both
    in scope and time than the exact reprodution of the Microsoft\u2122 Office\u2122
    Word\u2122 2010\u2122 (or Microsoft\u2122 Office\u2122 PowerPoint\u2122 2010\u2122)

  body: "I assume you're talking about uses such as putting social media logos (Facebook,
    Twitter, etc) at the bottom of the page with an invitation to visit your pages
    there, or placing a PowerPoint logo and saying \"download this info as a PowerPoint
    file\", and that kind of thing. Is that right? \r\n\r\nNormally you wouldn't put
    trademarked logos in the middle of a sentence, so I don't see why you'd need to
    incorporate them in a font. Just provide a collection of pre-existing logos to
    the users to place as graphic files. For the users' convenience, size them consistently,
    and give the files names that are easy to understand and which group all them
    together when viewed alphabetically (like \"icon_facebook_small.jpg\", \"icon_powerpoint_small.jpg\")."

    and then there is \"abuse.\"\r\n\r\nIf you are simply helping folks clarify where
    they are going when they click, AND there is no malice in your heart, then you
    a doing BOTH your font users AND the target sites a favor.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other

  body: "Hi all OP here, I set this and promptly forgot about it! Thanks for all your
    help. \r\n\r\n@Karl stange thanks -- yep that's what I thought , so just a general
    email to someone in charge of licensing outlining proposed usage might be the
    go? Sounds like from your experience you found the company accessible. Alternatively
    I find the contacts and then handball to the client\r\n\r\n@riccard0  I think
    you might be onto something there -- avoid the TMs altogether. The client has
    specified the exact problems but it may be more trouble then its worth. \r\n\r\n@Jamesm
    thanks, Just to clarify, I'm not looking to construct a font just a series of
    graphics.\r\n\r\n@Oldnick also depends on your contractual arrangement with your
    client too I'm guessing as to who's responsible for what. For the record Australia
    has fair-dealing rather than fair-use which seems to be narrower in scope than
    the states.\r\n\r\nthanks again, still scratching my head -- conversation with
    the client I'm thinking :) It seems the newer style web 2.0 style organisations
    accept that people will take their icons and use them and so provide more style-guide
    type guidance. This seems like a good way to go.\r\n"

    spent many years trying to learn Adobe\u2019s previous CS icons, I must say that
    I \uFB01nd the present coloured squares with letters much easier\u2014but that
    might not be the case if all the other icons in my Dock followed the same format!\r\n\r\nIf
    you do use proprietary images, the proprietors will no doubt immediately change
    them, rendering your artwork out of date, if not obsolete. But that wouldn\u2019t
    be so bad, it would be like how folks round here will give you directions like
    \u201Cturn left where the Price Chopper store used to be,\u201D a real team-builder
    once you \uFB01gure it out."
