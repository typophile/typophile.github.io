body: I am a student, and looking for someone &#40; type designer &#41; in the Cincinnati
  area that might be willing to give a little guidance, maybe able to meet periodically.
  I&#39;m starting my first full typeface soon, so if anyone has any leads, it would
  be much appreciated.

  body: Eric, where do you go to school? <BR> <BR>Are you looking for someone to help
    you with the technical aspects of designing for computer use &#40;hinting, etc.&#41;
    or for actual typographic help?

  body: Ok, <BR> <BR>I attended the University of the Arts &#40;pcad&#41;  for 2.5
    years. Funds ran dry. So now I am at Northern Kentucky. At UArts I had type design
    once with Inge Druckrey and once with someone else. So, I&#39;ve had enough that
    I can probably, on my own, do o.k. But I want to do better than o.k.  <BR> <BR>I
    have to compete with the folks at D.A.A.P.  <BR> <BR>I actually haven&#39;t even
    sat down with fontographer or fontlab yet, I just was hoping that someone with
    experience in the Actual DESIGN of type would be willing to lend insight/mentoring/
    in-progress critiques, God knows theres no one at my school that could remotely
    do it.

    take that as a compliment &#40;Graphic Design, &#39;07&#41; <BR> <BR>My recommendation
    is to contact Professor Heinz Schenker at UC/DAAP. He teaches most of the typography
    courses, including the intro class where you design entire lettersets. He is amazingly
    perceptive and helpful in type design. He more or less turned me into the typophile
    I am now.  <BR> <BR>The only thing I can warn you about is that he favors very
    traditionalist type design &#40;i.e. I attempted to make a sans serif double-story
    lc g and he kinda balked at it&#41; <BR> <BR>I hope that helps. I&#39;d love to
    take a look at some of it if you get to a point where you&#39;d like a third &#40;albeit
    somewhat green&#41; perspective.'

  body: No, not necessary. Maybe you can just mention that a student of his recommended
    you to him. <BR> <BR>And he may not be able to help you, but I&#39;m sure he could
    at least help with some recommendations of others in the area. He&#39;s a slightly
    eccentric guy, just to warn you, and is not super fluent with English &#40;he&#39;s
    from Switzerland&#41;. <BR> <BR>I just remembered there is a Senior Designer at
    Landor Cincinnati that also has some experience in type design. I&#39;m blanking
    on his name right now, but if I come up with it, I&#39;ll let you know. Maybe
    Heinz or one of the other UC professors knows his name. He&#39;s a DAAP grad if
    I remember.
