  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>At a time of corporate downsizing and outsourcing, freelance writers have found a great way to protect and grow income. Why? Nowadays, successful freelance writing jobs offer the chance of earning a good income, while working from the comfort of home and spending less to get started.</p>
<p>The question now turns to how can an aspiring freelance writer be successful in such field? What are the basic tricks in becoming one of the next proficient and profit-generating freelance writers? Here are some tips:</p>
<p><strong>Create a clear cut between work and home.</strong><br>
It’s always efficient to have a division between work and home although freelance writers do most of their task at home. It is advisable to have <a href="http://www.aolcdn.com/living_nyny/103-home-office-space-12-438x328jf010207.jpg">a designated work space</a>. An office or studio space outside of the house is preferable. If not possible, create a home office with a door is the next best option. If still not applicable, go to your local Pier 1 and buy a Chinese screen and section off a corner of a room and viola – an instant office.</p>
<p><strong>Dress up and take off the pajamas.</strong><br>
It’s more inspiring to work if you’ll <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/248/461497568_36f89065d6.jpg">dress like you’re going to the office</a>. Why? Because indeed you are. Even if your “office” is only your kitchen table, wearing regular work clothes puts you into the right mind-set.</p>
<p><strong>Go to work on time.</strong><br>
One of the best things that freelance writers enjoy is the luxury of hassle-free commuting. However, this does not mean that you can go to work whatever time you’d like. You’ve already bought yourself a little time out of the travel-free set up of freelance writing. So go ahead and grab that extra cup of coffee but it’s better for your clients and personal sanity if you keep at a relatively <a href="http://www.azsignshop.com/images/business-hours.gif">normal business hours</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t watch TV while working.</strong> 
Never mix pleasure with business as they say. You’re working, so go and work. However, occasional naps are acceptable and a great way to be reminded that while you might not have a technical support, you still have a pretty awesome working life.</p>
<p><strong>Have regular breaks and go out to lunch.</strong> 
Writing life, especially freelance writing life, can be isolating and tiring. And everybody knows that isolation can lead to one serious thing: insanity. So practice taking regular breaks just like what usual working people do. It is also ideal to go out to lunch sometimes so as to free and freshen up your mind.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other things that can contribute to being one of those successful <a href="http://www.writers.ph/">freelance writers</a>, like meeting deadlines and not annoying the clients. But those things are better figured out through experiences. In the meantime, put that remote control down and get to work.</p>
