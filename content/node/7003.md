  body: Oli, I smiled when I saw this. I think it would be very difficult to get the
    balance that you have with such a low waistline in the glyphs. <BR> <BR>I really
    like the P.  <BR> <BR>I think the B is all right too but it&#39;s bottom left
    seems to rush up too fast to the vertical stem. Maybe try squaring it just a little.
    I think more like the D and less like the C. <BR> <BR>The bottom of the S might
    need to be the tiniest bit wider because of the overall low waistline of the alphabet.
    The R might need this too. <BR> <BR>Thanks for sharing. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: It looks to me like there&#39;s not enough overshoot in your rounds. For instance,
    your B doesn&#39;t appear to meet the baseline at the same place as your A. The
    new B in the sample your posted looks taller - maybe you&#39;ve already made this
    adjustment.

    fairly happy with the letters now, still working on those lowercase though.

  body: Oli, it&#39;s looking nice. Can&#39;t wait to see the lc. In the example you
    provide the R looks a little too short and the T a little too tall. <BR> <BR>Actually
    all the curved tops look too shoort. Maybe they require a touch more overshoot.
    Or is it the anti-aliasing in the PNG that&#39;s doing that? <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Yeah, I think that this is pretty sweet.  <BR> <BR>What will you do for the
    numbers? And lowercase? It would be cool if you made a unicase version, too
