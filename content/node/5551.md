  body: Alessandro, I am not too sure if I understand your question correctly.. <BR>
    <BR>Are you asking what its usable for.? &#40; Or if its usable at all.? &#41;
    <BR>What do you think.? Do you like it.? Why / Why not.? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><i>&#40; Its a &#39;fun&#39; display type.. Nothing
    too serious at all.. Its just something I wanted to do for quite some time now..
    The original idea and scribbles were created more than two years ago.. Originally
    for a different font, named &#39;Play&#39; and this may be the remixed version,
    then.. &#39;formlos PlayR&#39;.. &#41;</i>

  body: 'Mr. David Hubner: <BR>my question is about the idea behind the fittings,
    <BR>the color spots where some strokes meet one another. <BR>It looks so uneven
    that I might think that it works better <BR>printed at 5 pt. Or then why you didn`t
    planned this pimple <BR>for all the letters? Now it is aesthetically unpleasant.
    <BR>  &#62; Are you asking what its usable for? What do you think? <BR>No, but
    to answer you I think that it could denote certain <BR>new synthetic music styles
    or cosmetics for pimples :-&#41; <BR>&#40;No offence, I am joking&#41;. If I like
    it? <BR>I don`t because it is a pity that intending to design a light <BR>&amp;
    delicate typeface you ended up working on the black instead <BR>that on the white,
    or am I wrong?  I mean: &#34;Write the story. <BR>Take out all the good lines,
    and see if it still works.&#34; <BR>Best, <BR>AS'

  body: 'Thank you, Mr. Alessandro Segalini.. I think I see &#40; some of &#41; your
    points.. <BR>Still, this is an experimental typeface, a &#39;fun&#39; display
    face, like I stated before.. <BR> <BR><i>&#40; Sure.: Some may like it, some may
    not.. &#41;</i>'

  body: 'Hello Mr. David Hubner: <BR>you could make a second remix of PlayR in the
    future <BR>to make it a text font, I think I would like to check it <BR>printed
    at small bodies, say 9 to 5 pt. <BR>I like when someone post something in the
    &#34;News &amp; Events&#34; <BR>even more if who does is not a big and famous
    foundry <BR>&#40;nothing against foundries being big&#41;; <BR>I am saying this
    because in my experience the good things <BR>come from the cellar so that was
    also a question about <BR>your cellar. <BR>Best, <BR>AS'

  body: Thank you.. I am also working on a few faces, intended for text use.. <BR>And
    maybe there will really be a &#40; more usable &#41; version of &#39;Play&#39;
    / &#39;PlayR&#39; in the near future.. <BR><i>&#40; As I am currently in the &#39;Think,
    Scribble &amp; Design&#39; process, this may still take some time.. &#41;</i>
    <BR> <BR>And, I am pretty happy and excited about being able to release my type
    experiments and fonts under my own &#39;Cellar Type Foundry&#39;.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
