  (can be found at http://www.urlaubsgruss.com/postkarte-online-gestalten.html)\r\n\r\nI've
  not seen this anywhere else and I would really like to use it on my own.\r\n\r\nI've
  been trying to use some online font identifying services to try and find out what
  the name and source of the font is, but so far I've had no luck.\r\n\r\nI hope you
  guys can help, if you need more examples I can add some more."
