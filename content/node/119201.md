  body: "PI, the brand dates from 1960, and it is quite likely that the script was
    hand-lettered. As such, it was never a typeface that was commercially available.\r\n\r\nAnd
    while Font Bureau's Titling Gothic is a decent match for the other type, it's
    more likely that it is the inspiration for Titling Gothic (which was designed
    in 2005), a typeface called ATF Railroad Gothic."

  body: "If you want a digital substitute for this hand lettered script, I suggest
    Filmotype Jade -- a script font from the era when the brand was created -- with
    width expanded 130 percent.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FilmotypeJadeInUseWidth130pctSM_4794.jpg]\r\nFor
    the flavor of the script, but not the width, You could use Filmotype Jade out
