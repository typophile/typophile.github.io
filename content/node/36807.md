    Apple has to re-invent the platform to entice upgraders by adding features people
    will find compelling - \u201Cpeople like TV, Web Browsing and paying $5 for a
    coffee so let\u2019s add those features to the new devices.\u201D ;-)"

    The people at Pantone are probably rolling their eyes. They should have put that
    160gb hard drive inside the Touch so there would be a reason to buy it. You can
    only access the internet when you're near a computer or a wifi network. But what
    about when I look up stuff when I'm driving? Can't. That's for the iphone. Poor
    execution on Steve's part. As it stands, I'm waiting for the iphone to have bluetooth,
    real GPS, 3g, tmobile, take video, and be about $200. In the mean time I'll wait.

    Barf. \r\n\r\nHowever, it provides a useful comparison with the iPod text. We
    may bitch about the presence of Helvetica, but the quality of text on this high-res
    monitor is much more acceptable. \r\n\r\nAt some point, probably within 2 years,
    Apple will offer a larger device that's more of a reader/PDA/touchscreen multi-purpose
    device. That's what the iPhone is a prototype for. At that point, they'll offer
    books for download. And I imagine they'll look quite good on a 200-ppi display. "

    cool enough. I wonder if they are looking beyond the browser with its PDF style
    pan, scan and zoom interface to a page based interface, like the NYT Reader. Also
    although it\u2019s great to see all those Microsoft, Linotype and Monotype fonts
    on the iPhone I would have thought if eBooks were on their radar they\u2019d be
    investing in screen type, and revisiting their rendering philosophy \u2013 I suppose

    this respect, Tiger already has it.  You can turn on resolution independence in
    Tiger but type is about the only thing that scales cleanly. This picture shows
    Safari running at 144, with the UI Rez window running at 72.   http://media.arstechnica.com/images/tiger/safari-scaled-2x-big.jpg\r\n\r\nApple
    DOES have a new type technology, although in part it could just be a rebranding
    of existing technology.  However, I don't have a beta of Leopard, and so beyond
    knowing of CoreText via random clues on Apple's site, I don't have a clue exactly
    what it is (I joined the Apple mailing list for it, but there haven't been any
    posts at all).  Maybe they'll be supporting more OT features, but until it's released
    I'd imagine only the Adobe folks on the forum here would know, and they can't
    say anything about it.  Given what CoreAnimation, CoreImage, CoreAudio, etc, brought
    to earlier versions, decent speculation could be made.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro
