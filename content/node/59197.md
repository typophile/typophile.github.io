  body: While FF Pitu may have its merits, and it is contemporary, I can't help feel
    that if used for a beauty center,  it would scream Botox and  scalpels. Then again,
    maybe that would perfectly communicate a beauty center these days

    now. Any font-suggestion for headlines and/or text is welcome. My first idea was
    using a \"clean\" sans but I think it needs more personality. Thanks again"
