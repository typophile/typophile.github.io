body: The book I&#39;m typesetting right now has numerous fractions, and I was wondering
  if I could get advice on the best way to create them.  I don&#39;t have <i>Elements
  of Typographic Style</i> handy at the moment. <BR> <BR>1. I know enough to use the
  fraction-slash &#40;I forget the correct name&#41; <BR> <BR>2. What percentage of
  the full point size can I make the numerator and denominator without them looking
  too light? <BR> <BR>3. Should it be flush with the baseline, or can lowercase numerals
  &#40;like 3&#41; hang below? <BR> <BR>Paul
