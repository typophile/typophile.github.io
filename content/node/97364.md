  They only measured eye movements. No comprehension accuracy. Disappointing. However,
  it\u2019s data does point towards possibly refuting the significance one of our
  oldest adages: \u201CAny man who would letterspace blackletter would steal sheep.\u201D
  ~Goudy, F. (1936). \r\n\r\n<strong>Background</strong>\r\nSeveral recent studies
  have revealed that words presented with a small increase in interletter spacing
  are identified faster than words presented with the default interletter spacing
  (i.e., w a t e r faster than water). Modeling work has shown that this advantage
  occurs at an early encoding level. Given the implications of this finding for the
  ease of reading in the new digital era, here we examined whether the beneficial
  effect of small increases in interletter spacing can be generalized to a normal
  reading situation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Methodology</strong>\r\nWe conducted an experiment
  in which the participant\u2019s eyes were monitored when reading sentences varying
  in interletter spacing: i) sentences were presented with the default (0.0) interletter
  spacing; ii) sentences presented with a +1.0 interletter spacing; and iii) sentences
  presented with a +1.5 interletter spacing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Principal findings</strong>\r\nResults
  showed shorter fixation duration times as an inverse function of interletter spacing
  (i.e., fixation durations were briefest with +1.5 spacing and slowest with the default
  spacing).\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusions</strong>\r\nSubtle increases in interletter
  spacing facilitate the encoding of the fixated word during normal reading. Thus,
  interletter spacing is a parameter that may affect the ease of reading, and it could
  be adjustable in future implementations of e-book readers.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0047568?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FSciencePolicy+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+Science+Policy%29#abstract0"

    5 of their text, just after the sentence I quoted, and down to the bottom of the
    first column of text on that page. In this section, difficulties in integrating
    the word as a whole when the spacing was somewhat large, are mentioned. I am guessing
    the authors mean: in what Pelli and Legge call the uncrowded window, though this
    isn\u2019t clear. But a change in the parafoveal preview benefit isn\u2019t ruled
