    and duct tape will be competing for space with cockroaches when the planet is
    destructed....  ;-)

  body: ROFL!  The stuff we have at home (since I started rolling our own cones) is
    enough for me, but the wee dab served at my fave little place can peel the soles
    off one's shoes....  ;-)  All I ever want is the barest coating on my chopsticks,
    but I went for something considerably larger than the head of a pin on Friday.
