body: "I need to find a super-condensed bold typeface for the cover of a small format
  paperback book. The cover is type-only and some of it will be spot laminated, so
  it needs to be very chunky. And we want to set the type very large.\r\nAt the moment
  we're using Bureau Grot compressed book, which is lovely, but feels a little too
  old and traditional. The book is about the art world, so it needs to look elegant
  but we'd like it to also look really fashionable/youthful. Someone suggested going
  for something more like Macula which looks fashionable, unusual, playful -- all
  good -- but it's not condensed enough to set at a really big size.\r\nCan anyone
  suggest some attention-grabbing alternatives that have the required height and chunkiness?\r\n\r\nAny
  help much appreciated -- thank you!\r\n\r\n"

    by Flat-It you could generate great typographic images.  "
