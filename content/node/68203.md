body: "Hey there, just finished the characters for this typeface last night. Test
  printed it today to discouver extra hairlines show up in the print on a bunch of
  the letters at large sizes. Nothing is auto traced, I painfully hand traced every
  letter in AI with a Wacom to keep the font clean. Any ideas what the problem could
  be? Thanks a ton.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/print-error_5911.jpg]"

    just printed the same document on a different colour printer with no hairlines,
    I dunno about that either. Thanks Mark, I will have a look at the glyphs."

  body: Mark, do over lapping nodes show up as yellow in FontLab? If so that probably
    is the problem.

  body: I meant adjacent nodes that have the same x/y location. But, on second though,
    I'm not sure that would cause that.

    trying to find where this \u201CFix Start Points for Spikes\u201D is located in
    FontLab. Anybody know how to run this script?"

    everyone for taking the time to help me out. What I think I did wrong was draw
    to many details in Illustrator. In the future I will not work zoomed in so tight.
