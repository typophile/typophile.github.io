  body: "Electronic typewriter manufacturers of the era usually included  a crisp
    squarish font under proprietary names such as Cubic, Techno, Report, Block, or
    Quadro. \r\nThere is a digital revival of this genre that looks similar to your
    label: Cubiculum by Johan Winge http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/johan-winge/cubiculum/\r\nStill
    checking to see if there are others.\r\nDon"

  body: "Cuomotype by Ray Larabie http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/cuomotype/
    looks like an exact match to your label.\r\nUnfortunately is is offered only in
    a distressed version.\r\nDon"

  body: "Found a better quality digital recreation of the letters in your typewritten
    label by \"Mr. Fisk.\"  It includes identification of the machine as \"a602\"
    and is called \"Typewriter - a602 (dead postman 2004) Font\" http://www.1001fonts.com/typewriter-a602-dead-postman-2004-font.html
    A few minor differences, mainly in several of the numbers. An improvement over
    Cuomotype, but still could use editing to clean up the outlines.\r\nDon"
