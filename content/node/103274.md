  Pro</a></strong>. We hope you like it as much as we do.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophileesmeralda_6485.png]\r\n\r\nAbout
  <strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/esmeralda-pro/\">Esmeralda
  Pro</a></strong>\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning \u201C<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/esmeralda-pro/\">Esmeralda
  Pro</a></strong>\u201D was born with a strong influence of the classical \u201Ccapitalis
  monumentalis\u201D, carved in stone. In the same way, the origin of this majuscule
  writing emerged from the brush, from a way of writing made merely by hand. For this
  reason, these two universes were intended to lie beneath the shape of each letter,
  redefining them. And this combination of styles should also be reflected in a lowercase
  set that also allows to open up the spectrum of usage possibilities. Foundational
  calligraphy represented a solid base for the development of lower case glyphs, ensuring
  proper interaction with the uppercase letters.\r\n\u201C<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/esmeralda-pro/\">Esmeralda
  Pro</a></strong>\u201D features a great amount of ligatures that mix classic structures
  with a more contemporary impression. With more than eleven hundred glyphs, it provides
  a multiplicity of uses across a wide combinatory of ligatures, alternative signs,
  initial caps, miscellaneous and connectors; each one of them accessible through
  Opentype.\r\n\r\n\u201C<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/esmeralda-pro/\">Esmeralda
  Pro</a></strong>\u201D is perfect to speak with a classical yet fresh, modern, \u2013and
  a little bit bold\u2013 tone of voice.\r\n\r\nDesigned by Guille Vizzari, together
  with the tough and remarkable work of Ale Paul, \u201C<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/esmeralda-pro/\">Esmeralda
  Pro</a></strong>\u201D \u2013when in use\u2013 stands out in a subtle and unexpected
  way, almost unnoticeable. It\u2019s delicate yet solid curves, serifs and endings
  give each composition a fine, elegant and exquisite feeling, along with a firm and
  sturdy look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ST_ESMERALDA_PANTALLAS-typo_A13_30_5501.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ST_ESMERALDA_PANTALLAS-typo_A13_18_6001.jpg]\r\nThe
  \u201C<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/esmeralda-pro/\">Esmeralda
  Pro</a></strong>\u201D project was initially born as a typographic project developed
  by Guillermo Vizzari \u2013tutored by Ale Paul and Ana Sanfelippo\u2013 under completion
  of the Specialization in Typography Design at University of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
  during the years 2011 and 2012.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ST_ESMERALDA_PANTALLAS-typo_A13_04_3929.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ST_ESMERALDA_PANTALLAS-typo_A13_36_4316.jpg]\r\n\r\nLicense
