  body: "Thank You Mr. Gordon. Much Appreciated!\r\n\r\nDef looks looks like \"House
    - Chalet Comprim\xE9\" and the font even has a couple different \"S\" options.
    \r\n\r\nThis must be a combination of a Chalet Comprim\xE9 - Cologne 1970 for
    most characters, and then they switch to Chalet Comprim\xE9 - Cologne 1960 for
    the more rounded S character in this layout.\r\n\r\nThanks again!!!\r\n\r\n"
