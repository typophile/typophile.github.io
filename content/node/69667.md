  body: Predigital, probably phototype. House Industries and Font Diner have both
    acquired some of the old phototype assets, but digitizing all those will take
    a long time.

  body: My guess is that it is either something like Aurora Bold Condensed heavily
    cusomized, or it's completely custom. I don't think you'll find an off-the-shelf
    font that matches this.
