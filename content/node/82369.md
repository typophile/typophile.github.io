body: "Hello all!!\r\n\r\nI'm finishing right now my degree on Marketing and i'm starting
  to write my final report on my internship. This is the most important task i've
  done in all my academic life, so it's extremely important to build a good looking
  document.\r\n\r\nSince it's going to have a lot of text i want to choose a font
  that doesn't become hard to read after a few pages, but at the same time, it must
  be good looking to help in the overall looks.\r\n\r\nI'll leave you a print screen
  of one of the document's page with some text written with the Helvetita font. I
  want to write in a dark grey instead of the usual black, because i think it gives
  a better look. I think this Helvetica i've used isn't helping at all.\r\n\r\nPrint:\r\n<img

  me some of our opinions, i want the best looking document possible.\r\n\r\nP.S:
  One important thing, i need a free font, can't afford to pay for one..."

    indents)</li> <li>Tone down the keyline around the box</li><li>Flush left not
    justified (the word spaces are too big)</li><li>Rather than grey type, which can
    be problematic when printed, use a lighter weight of type, e.g. Helvetica 45</li><li>Choose
    a typeface with old style figures (they bespeak erudition) and a relatively short
    cap height. Thus, text such as "NP EN ISO 2008" will not be so obtrusive. If you
    must have lining figures, choose a style which has them the same height as caps
    (Helvetica doesn't)</li> </ol>
