body: "Hello all,\r\nI have in my hand a letter from a potential buyer asking for
  a corporate license quote for one of my fonts. I've never sold or purchased fonts
  on a corporate scale, so this is all new to me. When I drafted my standard EULA,
  it wasn't specific enough to cater to the specific needs of this client. \r\n\r\nFirst
  issue: broadcasting rights. They want to include the font in advertising for web
  and TV. I've always expect my fonts to be used in print/web advertising, but never
  TV. Should this bear any weight on the price I set for the corporate license?\r\n\r\nSecond
  issue: They would like \"rights to distribute the font to 3rd parties \u2013 agencies
  and vendors doing work on their behalf.\" Is this normal to ask for when dealing
  with licensing for hundreds of computers worldwide? \r\n\r\nMy EULA certainly prohibits
  distributing the fonts to third parties. Would it be against the type designer's
  code to allow it in this case? I definitely don't want to risk losing the sale.
  I was hoping to allow it with a significant markup, but how much? Any thoughts?"

    to charge a premium for those rights. Putting this another way, if your standard
    EULA is vague what would you do if a customer were to use the fonts in a TV ad?
    \r\n\r\nAs to redist rights, that's not an unusual request - no corporate client
    wants to count workstations. You could however require that the fonts be redistributed
    with a EULA that restricts the use of the fonts to specific work - that way the
    agencies and vendors wouldn't have rights to use them with projects for other
    clients. They'd have to come back to you to get those rights. \r\n\r\n "

    at all the same thing as a site license BTW) you will effectively no longer be
    able to sell the font. As such, they would have to pay you handsomely.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "sii, the point you made about not mentioning TV can certainly apply to usage
    on products+merchandising, which is bound to come up sooner or later. I think
    it's time to update my EULA. Thanks!\r\n\r\nhrant, charging a premium for the
    rights to redistribute seems reasonable now. Thanks. My only dilemma now is figuring
    out how much is \"fair\", as I wouldn't know where to begin, in terms of percentages.
    Any ethical formula for this kind of thing?\r\n"

  body: "Let\u2019s use a fictitious example, let\u2019s say Company Y is making a
    new smartphone, say the \u201CY-Phone\u201D and want to use your font to promote
    it. Theoretically Company Y might need to share the font with mobile carriers
    around the world, as well as some agencies, but those partners are unlikely to
    need site licenses, in many cases a 5, 10 or 15 user license would suffice for
    the marketing departments of those partners. Perhaps a total of 500 people might
    need the font and care to install it, even if hundreds of thousands may have access
    to the corporate servers that contain it. Company Y is basically buying convenience,
    no need to count workstations, no need to police usage, just the ability to zip
    up the font along with other marketing assets and distribute them to the partners.
    They also wouldn\u2019t want the partners to use the fonts for other projects,
    so chances are there will be a license that restricts use to promotion of the
    Y Phone, and not other products or unrelated services. \r\n\r\nSo one approach
    might be to estimate the number of people who need the font, say 500. Estimate
    how much you\u2019d charge for a 500 user license. Then add on a fee for convenience,
    and then remove a fee for limiting the fonts use to the promotion of the named
    product (via a EULA). Add on the normal stuff around restricting posting of fonts
    to the Web, the devices, etc., Then take a step back and think about competition,
    other similar font offerings, open source alternatives and how much it would cost
    to have a custom font created from scratch free from your restrictions. Then write
    up a quote and hope for the best.\r\n"

    advertising is very expensive. I would keep in mind what that says about their
    marketing budget when setting the price. That said, AFAIK House is the only foundry
    that requires a special license for advertising, and that\u2019s only in the case
    of ad agencies."
