body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Type and Lettering Styles]] : Venetian</strong>\r\n\r\nEarly
  [[Old Style]] of the Renaissance period, also called [[Humanist]]. Letterforms are
  based on calligraphic principles, including modulated [[stroke]], humanist axis,
  [[lachrymal terminal|lachrymal]] terminals, large [[aperture]]. The single most
  distinctive letter to distinguish Venetians from their cousins is the slanted crossbar
  in the miniscule 'e'. The Venetian [[italic|italics]] were designed separately from
  [[roman]] fonts and were used independently.\r\n\r\nThe archetypal Venetian font
  is that of [[Nicholas Jenson]], as used in the 1470 <em>Evangelica Praeparatione</em>
  by [[Eusebius]]. In fact, it is Jenson's city, Venice, that gives this family its
  name. The Eusebius was an absolute masterwork of printing, and is widely considered
  to be the first appearance of our entirely modern Roman letterforms.\r\n\r\nMany
  Venetian fonts are adaptations of the Eusebius, with varying levels of literalness.
  \"Nicolas Jenson SG\", (metal) Monotype Eusebius, Abrams Venetian, and Adobe Jenson
  are all fairly faithful adaptations. [[Centaur]] is a reinterpretation based on
  the calligraphic structure that [[Bruce Rogers]] saw from his study of photographic
  enlargements of the Eusebius. ATF [[Cloister]] falls somewhere between the literal
  and calligraphic categories, as does the similar [[Doves Press]] font. [[Goodchild]],
  by [[Nick Shinn]], and its headline companion [[Nicholas]], is a modern update of
  the calligraphic approach, with a large [[x-height]] and tight [[letterspacing]].\r\n\r\nThe
  Zeno type of [[Giovanni Mardersteig]] can also be classified as a Venetian, and
  bears many similarities, while also displaying the master craftsmanship and distinctive
  style of Mardersteig's hand, working in collaboration with punchcutter [[Charles
  Malin]].\r\n\r\nOne branch of the Venetian family tree caricatures the relatively
  heavy serifs compared with the later movement to hairlines, culminating in the [[Didone|Didones]].
  The [[Kelmscott Press]] and [[Golden types]] of [[William Morris]] are the best
  known examples, both exhibiting heavy slablike [[serifs]] bearing little resemblence
  to the Eusebius original, which was impressively refined not only for its day but
  for several centuries afterwards. ITC released its revival of the Golden type in
  1989. ITC Italia also shows clear influence from the Golden tradition, but also
  mixes in elements of [[Souvenir]] and the slab serifs.\r\n\r\nIn an even more radical
  interpretation, Monotype's [[Legacy Sans]] claims to be a sans serif based on the
  skeletal structure of the Eusebius.\r\n\r\nVenetian was a brilliant and highly readable
  advance in the design of letterforms. The [[Garalde]] style was clearly an incremental
  evolution of the standard set by Jenson, and its differences are primarily in small
  details such as the crossbar of the 'e'. Designers continue to draw inspiration
  from this landmark font, and new designs in the Venetian tradition are still going
  strong.\r\n"
