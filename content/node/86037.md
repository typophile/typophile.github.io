body: "It\u2019s more rational than Helvetica or DIN, but also more friendly. A stricktly
  neutral international typeface for everyone.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s accessable and open
  and it reads well. It comes standard with small caps, old style numbers, table numbers,
  ligatures, alternative glyphs for a, e, g and E, arrows in all directions and last
  but not least: Central European Language support.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I don\u2019t
  seem to be able to upload images to Typophile right now so here\u2019s a link to
  a PDF:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.alexscholing.nl/images2/CoreHumanistSans_specimen.pdf\r\n\r\nYou
  can download CoreHumanistSans for free at http://www.alexscholing.nl\r\n\r\nHope
  you like it.\r\nCheers, Alex"

  body: "Interesting design. I'm downloading it now.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism is that
    your EULA document has some corrupted spacing, and is impossible to read (at least
    for me, in Safari)."

  body: "Try it in a dedicated PDF reader. It's quite reasonable anyway. Commercial
    use OK. Hacking for own use OK. Flash and PDF embedding OK. @font-face use OK
    but conditional to attribution in CSS. No derivatives save for personal use. No
    redistribution.\r\n\r\nIMAO, that's downright liberal for an EULA."

  body: "Funny thing with this EULA PDF. Half the time it\u2019s as it should be,
    the other half it\u2019s indeed messed up. Replaced the file several times (different
    settings) but to no avail. Still figuring it out."
