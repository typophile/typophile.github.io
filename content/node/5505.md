  body: The &#34;g&#34; is definitely <i>NOT</i> Democratica, and it&#39;s ugly as
    hellsing?. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR>It&#39;s completely out of place because both the contrast and the  <BR>serif
    shapes are wrong. They could at least have built it by using  <BR>parts of Democratica
    characters IMHO. Why didn&#39;t they use the  <BR>original &#34;g&#34;? It&#39;s
    beautiful. <BR>The &#34;H&#34; looks like the real deal. They enlarged it to match
    the  <BR>height of the &#34;l&#34;.
