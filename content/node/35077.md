  body: "Pro: It's really the only way to switch html text to your own font on the
    fly.\r\n\r\nCons: Flash is based on quadratic curves, not bezier, so there is
    some distortion of the letterforms that savvy folks will notice. It can also be
    slow to load if you have a lot of sIFR or your server is weak.\r\n\r\nIt's become
    more popular, with even some major corps employing it, but I don't think it's
    quite mainstream yet."

  body: "Ech... It has the capability of doing horrendous things to the aliasing of
    type. My suggestion is to stay away from very subtle kinds of type and stick to
    the beefier, more blocky types. Clarendon vs Baskerville for instance.\r\n\r\nWhat's
    very, very cool about this technique is that unlike an image, you can still select
    the type! 99% of end users won't notice the difference, aside from the things
    mentioned by Stephen."

  body: "But there's a lack of kerning in these headings. Flash supports* kern definitions
    for embedded font in dynamic text field but this requires \"kerning\" property
    set to \"true\" in StyleSheet or TextFormat, which is \"false\" by default. JavaScript
    file, which implements these \"flashish\" headings on Typophile does not define
    this property. This should be confronted with appropriate developer.\r\n\r\n*
    There's one strange hack \u2013 reference says, that kerning in Flash is supported
    only in swfs created on Windows."

  body: "Text antialiasing improved a lot in version 8 of Flash Player.\r\n\r\nBut
    sIFR 2 is by default set to target FP version 6. Which means: even if a more recent
    version of the FP is installed, text is rendered like in version 6.\r\n\r\nTo
    get the better text rendering of FP8, it is necessary to change the Flash Version
    to 8 under Publish Settings, set the TextField antialiasing setting to \"Anti-alias
    for readability\", and republish the SWF file.\r\n\r\nsIFR 3 beta is already available
    and targets FP8, but it seemed very buggy last time I tried it.\r\n\r\n-- <a href=\"http://www.omine.net/\">omine.net</a>"

  body: It's been a while since I've tried sIFR, but as I remember it's kind of a
    pain. The solution we use here uses the flash extension for jQuery. It makes it
    really easy to write the substitution rules. [[http://jquery.lukelutman.com/plugins/flash/]]

  body: "Life promises to get interesting over the next year or so, because you can
    <em>also</em> do sIFR-like stuff using Safari/Firefox Canvas (which implements
    cubic drawing natively), and of course the MS platform gives you a bunch of different
    ways of accomplishing more or less the same thing, as long as you're willing to
    drink their kool-aid.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the distortion in pre-8 Flash is not
    because it's based on quadratics per se (remember, native TrueTypes are quads
    as well), but because that conversion is done crudely. I'd guess that they implemented
    conversion from Type1 a long time ago and never really had a chance to redo it
    right. That is, of course, until Flash 8, where they reimplemented the whole font
    stack from scratch. The free software communist in me doesn't like it because
    it forces you to use proprietary tools, but that's probably not as important a
    consideration for most of the people here.\r\n\r\nI think Adobe does a pretty
    good job of pushing new Flash versions. It's probably reasonable to expect version
    8 or better, especially if you can just fail to the wrong font, rather than to
    a totally broken page.\r\n"

    without the facts. I look forward to seeing an improvement in Flash 8 / sIFR 3.

    via proper alt attributes.\r\n\r\nYes, if Selecting and Searching on-page are
    imortant, though, sIFR probably wins. But, you really shouldn't be using sIFR
    for anything more than headlines, so perhaps that benefit isn't as strong at that
    point.\r\n\r\n\"but i don\u2019t know why, something just feels so satisfactory

    Myriad Pro in CS2 Package</a> thread:\r\n\r\n<strong>DanGayle</strong>:\r\nThe
    file that is used by sIFR is basically the digital font embedded in a .SWF Flash
    file. I\u2019ve seen websites that clearly violate the spirit of the EULAs by
    distributing that .SWF across the internet for free, possibly just renaming the
    .SWF file.\r\n\r\nI know in my heart of hearts that that is wrong, but where does
    that stand legally?\r\n\r\n<strong>sii</strong>\r\nIf you take the position that
    in this case the .SWF is a derivative font, then for sure this would break most
    font EULAs. Someone would need to go after one of these guys to prove that. Obviously
    that \u2019someone\u2019 would not be Adobe. ;-)\r\n\r\nIn the past I don\u2019t
    think type designers have shown any interest in testing the limits of Flash and
    font encapsulation. Turning a blind eye often comes back to bite you. This may
    be a case of that, and who wants to be bitten by a blind eye.\r\n\r\nI recall
    writing to the lead developer of Flash before it was even a Macromedia asset,
    regarding respect for embedding permissions. I don\u2019t recall the exact answer
    but I don\u2019t think it was positive. I have no idea what Flash does now.\r\n\r\nThis
    was a loooooooong time ago, and my employer at the time was probably a temp agency.
    In addition I think the type community\u2019s lack of interest in Flash extended
    to MS as well as everyone else. It\u2019s been a few years since the product was
    aquired by Adobe so they must be doing the right thing. Anyone tried embedding
    a no-embedding font using Flash?\r\n\r\n<strong>Miss Tiffany</strong>\r\nUnless
    my most recent research has a major error \u2014 Thomas please correct me! \u2014
    Fonts licensed from Adobe which are from Adobe Originals, Bauer, & other wholly-owned
    fonts by Adobe can be used embedded in things such as sIFR.\r\n\r\n"
