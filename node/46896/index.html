<p>Hmmm.
&ldquo;No one can argue that improvements around fonts for the web aren’t long overdue,&rdquo;
Well some people have successfully argued against doing anything productive for near 1.5 decades, quite obviously, right?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;but the current scheme has various drawbacks.&rdquo;
There is one? I mean, there is a scheme and it is cross-platform, cross-browser and solitary?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most serious problem being that only freeware fonts can be used&hellip;&rdquo;
Is this true? Does font embedding prevent the use of non-freeware fonts?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; with the fonts web designers want to use are completely off-limits&hellip;&rdquo;
Who knows what they want, or what their licenses allow, so, what da heck is &ldquo;completely off-limits&rdquo;?</p>
<p>All comment types encouraged, (except for Varge, who needs to shut up forever;).</p>

<p>DB&gt; This session description,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not the description for Adam&rsquo;s talk and the panel discussion to follow - it&rsquo;s a blog entry I wrote for the TypeCon blog&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typecon.com/talk.php?id=145">http://www.typecon.com/talk.php?id=145</a></p>
<p>&hellip;In which I encouraged people attending TypeCon to get educated on the issues, so that they can contribute their thoughts on the downloadable Web fonts scheme&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The “Web Fonts” scheme calls for fonts to be posted on web servers, downloaded and temporarily installed by browsers in order to render web pages. Earlier this year Apple’s Safari browser became the first to support the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NS&gt; The corporations that set the standards have annual revenue in the billions of dollars and will do what the hell they want, whatever you, I, the rest of the “font industry”, end users, or various governments have to say about it. If they want to exchange opinions amongst themselves on a panel at a type conference, your presence (or not) won’t make a blind bit of difference.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably right. For the record the multi-billion dollar revenuers Adam Twardoch, Roger Black, Ted Harrison, Erik van Blokland,  Zara Evens, and Bill Davis will be joined by Christopher Slye and me (MS and Adobe generally oppose the scheme). But aren&rsquo;t you playing into the hands of these evil standards-setters by remaining silent?</p>

<p>DB&gt;Who knows what they want,</p>
<p>Tom and Ralf have done polls so we know what web designers want. The same fonts they use in print and other medias, so called “commercial fonts”.</p>
<p>DB &gt; or what their licenses allow</p>
<p>We analyzed 30+ EULAs and none allowed posting to Web sites. Ralf and James are the only commerical font vendors experimenting with licensing fonts for use under the scheme.</p>
<p>DB &gt; so, what da heck is “completely off-limits”?</p>
<p>So the fonts web designers want to use, can’t be used under the scheme. Does that makes sense?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, fonts in PDFs are a source of problem for more than web designers. I have recommended to publishers in the past that they not use certain foundries fonts, because the EULA either outright forbids it or says something like &ldquo;contact the company for details on extra license needed&rdquo; (al la Font Bureau). The one time I did this (not Font bureau), I was told that since that exposed the font to an extra 100,000 computers, I&rsquo;d have to license it for those 100,000 computers. The price was astronomical. The font was not used for the book.</p>
<p>More than a few academic publishers have a contract with NetLibrary, which requires a PDF with full font embedding.</p>
<p>There needs to be a solution for this general problem, be it web or print. However, now that The Internet is such a large market, maybe a solution for that will be available for those of us who still only use type for print, too. Otherwise, we&rsquo;re going to have to drastically expand the calligrapher base.</p>

<p>I don’t think the panel will be discussing PDF embedding issues – rather font distribution as promoted under the Web fonts scheme and possible alternatives – I’m sure someone will suggest that SIFR, regular Flash files and PDF should be used for rich content, however the promoters of the scheme are looking for a HTML+CSS solution – an open standard not a closed proprietary system. A separate thread on PDF embedding would be appropriate for the release section.</p>

<p>One solution is for publishers to commission custom typefaces for which they can purchase rights up-to-and-including perpetual exclusivity. There comes a point where licensing existing commercial fonts for either a large install base or electronic distribution becomes more expensive than commissioning a custom font family. If individual publishers cannot afford to commission their own typefaces, they can join with others to pool their resources (as the members of the SBL Font Foundation have done). Such a solution works particularly well for academic publishers, since they tend also to have specialised requirements that existing commercial fonts may not support.</p>

<p>That will happen right after pigs start whistling as they fly about. Before academic publishers do that, they&rsquo;ll all move to open source fonts &amp; y&rsquo;all can complain about the sad state of typography in academic publishing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The more obvious solution is to use fonts with no commercial document embedding clause - such as those from Adobe or Microsoft. Adobe&rsquo;s having the advantage of allowing modifications (according to their FAQ).</p>
<p>Back on-topic - with PDF embedding you have a choice of vendors, most of whom allow embedding, some of whom have restrictions about what you can do with the document. With the web fonts scheme there are no vendors (except Ralf &amp; James) providing any licensing mechanism.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It does seem like there would be a mint to be made if you could charge micro payments like google does for rendering a site in the right font for it&rsquo;s users without exposing the the Intellectual property of the font to risk. Maybe sfir will get better and allow kerning and CALTs and so on&hellip; I am not sure but it looks to me like sfir is WAY to slow to render whole sites and that probably cannot be helped - ever. Probably the rendering does have to happen locally for it be a fast/tasty solution.</p>
<p>With all this technical trouble, the wisdom of John&rsquo;s comments about commissioning new designs does carry lots of weight.</p>
<p>The problem with that model is that it is geared to a narrow part of the font using market. A part of the market that is very organized and has specific ideas about what it wants. It&rsquo;s a formal market. I am not dismissing it, just characterizing it.</p>
<p>A bigger ( by volume) part of the market would be served by a service of the kind I have outlines above. That is a more casual market.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>With regard to the interesting question of EULAs not allowing fonts to be embedded in pdfs. This requirement only came into force a few years ago. Most of the fonts that anyone would want to use were already available by then, without quite such restrictive licenses. So couldn&rsquo;t you simply use an older version of the font which, obviously, is not subject to these silly new requirements? Hmmm, maybe my old Font Folios and Monotype Libraries are worth more than I thought - - not to mention the entire Bitstream and lots of ITC library that used to come with old versions of CorelDraw, old copies of which anyone could buy for pennies. I started throwing away font CDs in 1994 - - it was a big moment way back then! - - now I wish I&rsquo;d kept them.</p>
<p>Speaking of font values, I just found an interview I did with Alex Kaczun in 1992 when I was using MCI Mail for email. He said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;The biggest ripoff is people copying fonts, and they don&rsquo;t think anything of it.  There won&rsquo;t be any money or incentive to make new fonts if this goes on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>and that was before internet-enabled email was current.</p>
<p>Yes, we used to do it on floppies back then. URW made a huge fuss when they found out that Alex was using his Linotype-purchased Ikarus-M on his home Mac. How much was Ikarus-M back then? Five grand? Ten? Lino started counting up the hundreds of thousands they&rsquo;d passed URW&rsquo;s way, and I don&rsquo;t remember how it all got resolved. URW was nearly finito by then, but fortunately there was still enough money in the kitty a few years later to get Albert-Jan Pool to refit the whole library. That is now a good and inexpensive library - - I wonder if it has pdf restrictions?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The 1995 Microsoft Font Pack was said by InfoWorld to have made more money than all font foundries from the beginning of time. Nearly everybody who bought Windows 95 seemed to have bought it, for $99. Why not make that the standard? No restrictive licenses, and it can be had on eBay &lsquo;buy it now&rsquo; for a whole 49 cents.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even <em>find</em> Corel Draw 5, with its 1000 top quality fonts in TT and PS on eBay, that&rsquo;s how valueless it is. Again, no restrictive licenses.</p>
<p>Seriously, it is just BS to suppose that anyone will ever pay for web fonts, or even that they have any value.</p>
<p>Print publishers are 99.5% delighted with the 99.5% low-quality fonts they use everyday. Their customers are not complaining.</p>
<p>Micro-payments are never going to exist.</p>
<p>This discussion can&rsquo;t be rationally held without letting go of the fact that, post-PostScript, nobody is <em>ever</em> going to make huge money on fonts again. That is the meaning of the technology we have today.</p>
<p>Add to that the overwhelming demographic fact that the few of us who still believe software should be paid for will be completely extinct in 50 years.</p>

<p>That might spoil my current method of using only Verdana and Georgia for every single project. Does anyone really need a script face? Certainly Comic Sans is usable anytime you need a handwritten look. Right? (Sarcasm intended)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right Sii. Standards-based web designers have had about a half dozen to maybe a dozen common fonts to use for years. There is no reason that at least another handful of fonts couldn&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t be common to all browsers.</p>

<p>Well, my 2 cents is that in terms of &lsquo;licensing&rsquo; there is no difference. The issue is vendors vs. the public &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; vs. the customer.</p>
<p>Ideally, regardless of the particular electronic medium, the vendor will accommodate the needs of the customer without letting the paranoia of the &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; interfere.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m going out on a limb here with a suggestion. Some people will think this idea laffable. Let them eat cake, or frosted fonts. It worked for Wikipedia founders Jimbo Wales and Larry Sanger, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Here is what I think we should do: <strong>design a way forward</strong> by starting up a Font Media Foundation. F.M.F is to be an &ldquo;open font media&rdquo; bank, whose goals are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>assemble an open library of &ldquo;open licensed&rdquo; fonts designed specifically for web and new media use</li>
<li>all FMF fonts to be <strong>new creations</strong> wiki-made by the world&rsquo;s leading font makers</li>
<li>it works like the Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia Commons&mdash;except this is a Font Commons, initially for comon fonts long out of copyright, but eventually more and better stuff</li>
<li>font maker contributors start fonts and hopefully finish them. Contributors work on each other&rsquo;s fonts and hopefully finish them. It all takes place online in a wikimedia-powered environemnt. Eventually a big pile of great fonts get wiki-built.</li>
<li>font maker contributors don&rsquo;t get paid money. You do as little or as much as your commercial schedule allows</li>
<li>philanthropic contributors required to seed the project&mdash;Microsoft, Apple, Opera, Mozilla, W3C, Yahoo/Flickr, Google, AIGA, large design and ad agencies to provide seed funding and computers to host the font data</li>
<li>webpage designers and publishers who use the service FMF provides to be encouraged to make cash donations to the foundation, especially those who make commercial use of fonts held in the library. That kind of voluntary ongoing funding worked for Wikipedia and the Wikimedia foundation, so it could work for us.</li>
<li>if it&rsquo;s a success and the cash donations run into profit, I am more than happy to accept payment for my part in proceedings. In that case other contributing font makers and contributors should get paid too.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m ruling out adding existing fonts from any existing foundry catalog, especially the well-known retail and popular ones, regardless of their EULA types and terms, as a way of avoiding confusion and legal hassles.</p>
<p>A lot of people said Wikipedia would or could never work, but five years+ down the track it&rsquo;s the standard general reference on the web and still going strong. It&rsquo;s still something of a mess but the areas that really matter like science, history, the arts, politics and so on have been in great shape for several years already. I did my bit for typography at Wikipedia and now I would like to return to making fonts and getting a central wiki-authored font bank going as soon as humanly possible.</p>
<p>If the graphic design and web design industries want to avoid the looming spectre of the great web fugly and want decent fonts available online 24/7 to use on webpages—you are going to have to help pay for it. Fonts don&rsquo;t grow out of the ground. If commercial font makers like myself, David, Nick and others represented here at Typophile want to avoid the next big piracy nightmare and contribute to the solution—this is the way to go. We are going to have to co-operate and wiki-author fonts together.</p>
<p>I am willing come over there and help you guys set it up. It needs a charter and a steering comittee / board of directors. It needs a Tiffany too : ^ )</p>
<p>All suggestions and criticism welcome.</p>
<p>What else? I am very busy with my Harold Lohner conversation project right now but I will try find time to come back to this tomorrow.</p>

<p>Yeah, and that’s why I am willing to put up a 100 euro donation to fund the all-in purchase of an all in licence for — lets say — 50 greatlooking typefaces/families.
Me thinks that any designer that gets offered a six figure sum to liberate a family of six cuts will accept that. So with a fund of some 5 to 10 million bucks we’d resolve this issue in no time. Just a matter of a couple of thousand people who can offset the cost of a nice meal for the benefit of millions…</p>

Should I, give, the money, baaaack?
ES: &ldquo;It does seem like there would be a mint to be made if you could charge micro payments&hellip; &quot;
A greed. (before SII can say so;)
SD:&ldquo;With the web fonts scheme there are no vendors (except Ralf &amp; James) providing any licensing mechanism.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s just a scheme, why would any serious vendors provide for it until it&rsquo;s a standard and quality-approvable, when there is so much &lsquo;private&rsquo; web font work?
CE: &ldquo;David, fonts in PDFs are a source of problem for more than web designers.&rdquo;
If it zooms, I don&rsquo;t care, thanks.
JH: &ldquo;One solution is for publishers to commission custom typefaces for which they can purchase rights up-to-and-including perpetual exclusivity.&rdquo;
Yes, that is a good business. Do You think I should give, the money, back?</p>
<p>There is no standard font size(s) or rendering method. So, embedding = happy display faces, sad text faces. Text face makers are thus at both ends of the reading problem, waiting patiently to serve the public. Are readable screen fonts a technical problem with exclusively technical solutions, and not design problems with design solutions? Do you want to comment on that in the session SII? (Hopefully you saw MS&rsquo;s Mr. Hill&rsquo;s presentation of last year?)</p>
<p>Also, I learned something new four months ago or so — MS believes that no one, (outside of a very limited number of people on the whole planet), need to know what hints are recognized by Windows Vista in its default mode, in order to effectively provide text type to web clients and their clients. Do you want to comment on that too SII?</p>
<p>I of course, will brief Roger on these issues, and he will have the live options at session-time.</p>
<p>Nick: &ldquo;Shut Up David&rdquo;  (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing there.)

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just some thoughts on James' wiki approach &hellip; So basically you suggest that more free fonts available would cater the demand of potential webfont users.</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t need webfont-capable browsers for your idea. Make some high quality free fonts, then make a deal with operating system or browser makers to supply these fonts with their products.</p>
<p>But after a while these fonts would become as overused as the currently available choices, and clients still can&rsquo;t use their corporate fonts on the web, etc.</p>
<p>Plus, I&rsquo;m not sure the collaborative approach would work with fonts as it does with Wikipedia. Many people know a bit of information and spare ten minutes or so to submit it to Wikipedia. But how many people out there are able to produce high-quality fonts? Can they spare the time to do so for free? If they were to develop fonts together with other people, could they agree on a common format, i.e. would professionals learn to use FontForge or open source enthusiasts shell out for FontLab licenses?</p>
<p>Does democratic design work at all, especially in a field as type design, which requires so many aesthetic and stylistic decisions based on individual taste and reasoning, as well as highly-specialized knowledge?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, I do like your idea, it mirrors some suggestions I threw out a while back (in response to this <a href="http://www.designwritingresearch.org/free_fonts.html)">http://www.designwritingresearch.org/free_fonts.html)</a>. My model required that type designers get paid, had an international focus, and required a NickNeg style charismatic front-man to hit up Google, et al for the cash.</p>
<p>Why type designers need to be paid&hellip; In the historically accurate “300” movie King Gerry Leonidas asks various members of the volunteer Greek army what their professions are – “sculptor”, “baker”, “candlestick maker” come the replies. He turns to the Spartans and asks them what their profession is, with one voice “type designer”. There is a role for amateurs, beginners, students, foundry people, etc., in an effort like this, but if you’re building a library of quality typefaces for the world (not just the Web) you need the best of the best, and you need to pay them. I think we proved that to be the case with Verdana, and Georgia? Matthew and Tom are the Spartans of type design. Anyone disagree?</p>
<p>However, biggest problem with the plan is that it will do little to address one of the fundamental problems with the web fonts scheme, in that web page designers don’t want new fonts, they want to use the fonts they’re currently using in print – Gotham, Meta Serif, and Franklin ITC.</p>

<p>I do too. For web work, that is. But there is a drawback &ndash; a typographical (quality) one! People (not &ldquo;us people&rdquo;, &ldquo;them people&rdquo;) will perceive these fonts as <em>free</em> fonts. No matter how stringent the license is (i.e., in full caps, bold, red, &ldquo;For Web only&rdquo;), people will want to use the fonts in print <strong>because</strong> they can see them on the screen.
No matter how good the screen rendering of Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, and Times New Roman, I already have had a fair number of struggles with &ldquo;them people&rdquo; to try and convince them these are <em>screen</em> fonts, and we purchased CDs full of real, licensed fonts, just because they look better in print. It&rsquo;s not (purely) anti-Microsoft snobbery.</p>
<p><cite>[..] web page designers don’t want new fonts, they want to use the fonts they’re currently using in print ..</cite></p>
<p>.. so you&rsquo;ll bound to get a Fronklin Web family, a Footoora, a Jensoon, etc. After that, follow-ups will ask for <em>this</em> fonts to be used in print &ndash; because those are the fonts the web-designers use &hellip;</p>
<p>Everything on the Web is free. Quality is expensive. And them people will pick the free stuff.</p>

<p>Yes, Wal-Mart exists for a reason. But are we really targetting the &lsquo;people that always pick free&rsquo; anyways? If that demographic is always going to pick free, it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;d ever be a demographic worth going after anyways.</p>

<p>The Spartans? They lasted for 100&rsquo;s of years. And, don&rsquo;t ever forget, even if you didn&rsquo;t know before, the Spartans rose to ascendency by breaking the established rules of Hellenic war, with previously unheard of things like battlefield trickery, and the slaughtering of captives. When practiced in the neighborhood for a hundred years too long, this resulted in the eventual utter destruction of the entire Hellenic race. There are no Spartans, only movies made to help with recruitment.</p>
<p>SII: &ldquo;However, biggest problem with the plan is [&hellip;] that web page designers don’t want new fonts, they want to use the fonts they’re currently using in print – Gotham, Meta Serif, and Franklin ITC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, and no. They want new ones, and they want old ones. Either way, how are we going to get their quality if people like me can&rsquo;t do my job beyond the design of the outline? Hmmmmmm? Clearly, web versions of Gotham, Meta Serif, and Franklin ITC would require some kind of &lsquo;expected&rsquo; reaction to the grid&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>There is big problem with this that starts and ends at Microsoft Corporation, but what lies between, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting now.</p>

<p>You asked for all types of comments. My cynicism about the ability of type designers/indie foundries to influence the course of events is comprehensive. Nothing personal. I&rsquo;m quite prepared to defend my position, willingly participating in the conversation you initiated.</p>
<p>SD: (a)<em>&hellip;MS and Adobe generally oppose the scheme&hellip;</em></p>
<p>SD: (b) <em>&hellip;you can’t pick and choose what to support, especially if/when all your competitors, and an increasing number of web sites start to take advantage of it.</em></p>
<p>Surely, &ldquo;generally opposing&rdquo; is a disingenuous position, given the dominance of IE. 
If Firefox, with 20% browser share, adopts this scheme, Microsoft&rsquo;s general opposition will evaporate, prompted by the specific fear of losing market share.</p>
<p>Ergo, it is only a matter of time before this scheme becomes standard, as the font industry (should it wish to oppose it) has no influence over Firefox.</p>

<p>I mentioned the general opposition just to set expectations with regard to the make-up of the panel. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find many of the panelists supporting the scheme. However, I&rsquo;m sure there will be disagreements between us on the alternatives, and on licensing for Web usage.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s probably an accurate assessment. The people here (in the typography and IE groups) who think it’s a bad idea will continue to think it’s a bad idea - but it will be hard to hold back the tide if/when web designers embrace the scheme, especially if they stay within the law by using legitimate free fonts.</p>

<p>Well, Thomas, could you enumerate the licenses in which the opposite is true? (And what exactly <em>is</em> the opposite, anyhow?)</p>
<p>And are you hinting that one cannot pdf a font whose license predates anti-pdf fever? I would just love to see ITC, Monotype, Bitstream, Microsoft, or anyone else sue me for pdfing a ten-year-old font. I bet even Mrs Harvey Whatnot couldn&rsquo;t colorably do that.</p>
<p>And wasn&rsquo;t anti-pdf fever invented by Monotype as a way to get out of its Adobe commitments - - or something like that? Whatever - - it was very dodgy behavior on Monotype&rsquo;s part. Let&rsquo;s also remember just once more how unusable many of the Monotype Classic digitizations are, and how much work Adobe put into them . . . . .</p>
<p>Font companies, even Adobe - - are not very good at contracts. That&rsquo;s why Adobe doesn&rsquo;t have Berthold fonts anymore - - in spite of having thought it bought them til the end of time &ndash; as was no doubt Berthold&rsquo;s intention. Someone at Berthold must have known about Wagner&rsquo;s practice of selling his &lsquo;original&rsquo; scores many times over . . . . sheesh!</p>

<p>All that boils down to is asserting a right to sue almost everyone who has ever bought a font. Can this be where Adobe&rsquo;s thinking is going? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Maybe you meant to say &hellip; the &lsquo;opposite&rsquo;?</p>

I doubt you know what position you are in, unless possible you&rsquo;ve stumbled into a joint session of a congress of the cows. If you think that the developers in question have made it this far without massive influence from type designers/indie foundries etc. bend further. You think there are books on these topics? You think the wiki covered any of this in time to be useful? Do you think &lsquo;they&rsquo; talk exclusively to other OS or App developers?</p>
<p>&ldquo;..the font industry [&hellip;] has no influence over Firefox.&rdquo; 
I think the DMCA has a big enough influence. There will of course need to be an expensive test case. I am prepared to scratch bite, and maybe even sue until there is a place for quality personalized text type in all this marvelous moveable type technology.</p>
<p>Bill: &ldquo;All that boils down to is asserting a right to sue almost everyone who has ever bought a font.&rdquo;
Ahhhh, now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere. The FBI EULA Phanto-Clause would grant the user the license, delivery and appearance of the phont name in menus for their phee, and all other uses will be subject to additional phees. All neatly packaged where no one will read it.</p>
<p>James A: &ldquo;A lot of people said Wikipedia would or could never work, but five years+ down the track it’s the standard general reference on the web and still going strong.&rdquo;
Wikipedia is a huge pile of unreliable junk that must absolutely be cross-checked for every single detail in order to put money on the line based on what you find there. So, you&rsquo;d have to define &ldquo;work&rdquo; in a narrow, &lsquo;the actual facts are not really that important&rsquo; sort of use, like grade school homework, but yeah, it&rsquo;s the standard there.</p>
<p>I like some of the rest of your ideas, a lot.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>My first post was all I could come up with in two hours. I anticipated most of your criticisms and have taken the idea further on.</p>
<p>How an FMF might be made viable:</p>
<ul>
<li>make it a <strong>private</strong> wiki, <strong>for profit</strong></li>
<li>professional type designers and font makers only, no amateurs please</li>
<li>this is not a job for Joe Public. The general public will not be building fonts, nor will they be comenting on their creation.</li>
<li>forget about the mess that is Wikipedia, the wiki thing only applies here in two parts: 1) user community and media interface (using wikimedia software) for getting the collaborative font design and building work done. 2) a &ldquo;wiki-like&rdquo; philosophy of open collaboration between professionals who all know precisely what they (we) are doing.</li>
<li>would not be subject to the chaos caused by Wikipedia&rsquo;s policy of complete freedom of anyone to edit anything, or the problems inherent in getting anonymous contributors to write a general reference encyclopedia.</li>
<li>needs seed funding from the big guns in the type business &amp; the design industry to get it going, but after that, users pay for font usage on the web on a subscription-based licensing model.</li>
<li>contributors all get paid for their work, but the amount of work you contribute is on a volunteer basis. We, the guys and gals who make fonts commercially, contribute as much or as little time as each of us can spare.</li>
<li>the fonts in the media foundation will not be free, nor will they be distributable. Only user agents (browsers) will be able to access the font data and media.</li>
<li>stop thinking of it as freeware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other points of contention:</p>
<ul>
<li>the advantage of FMF to Apple, Microsoft, Adobe et al, is that existing commercial, retail and proprietary font licensing models do not need to change at all.</li>
<li>Apple is first to introduce a browser supporting @font-face, yet they remain opposed to licensing their fonts for web use. As Yves Peters once said, Choose a position and stick to it, guys. Introducing a supporting user agent is, in my view, a persuasive reason why Apple should stick to their guns with their font licensing, but give me some computers and cash to get FMF going.</li>
<li>if Microsoft introduce a supporting version of Internet Explorer, they could back it up with similar resources.</li>
<li>if W3C want to introduce the CSS @font-face rule they should help pay to set it up, or at least contribute staff and resources to help set it up and keep it going.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m really trying to look forward with this. <strong>Design a way forward</strong> tackles the most solid object here: the font industry&rsquo;s existing font licensing models are inappropriate, outdated and outmoded. They don&rsquo;t have to change, but the people involved could contribute some time and skill to creating the alternative&mdash;a library of fonts that do what web designers and CSS need them to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either that, or them peoples will be using them free fonties like there isn&rsquo;t no tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now can I has a cookie?</p>

<p><cite>Only user agents (browsers) will be able to access the font data and media.</cite></p>
<p>Technically impossible. Any designer can install wget on his mac and spoof browser agents from the command line. Put in the most insane DRM system you can dream of and it’s still going to get cracked.</p>
<p><cite>stop thinking of it as freeware</cite></p>
<p>How are you going to get designers to do that? From what I can tell most of them already treat commercial fonts as freeware and they tend to get testy about people suggesting that they pay for fonts.</p>
<p><cite>Apple is first to introduce a browser supporting @font-face, yet they remain opposed to licensing their fonts for web use.</cite></p>
<p>Are the people Apple licensed the fonts from willing to license for web use?</p>
<p><cite>if W3C want to introduce the CSS @font-face rule they should help pay to set it up, or at least contribute staff and resources to help set it up and keep it going.</cite></p>
<p>Font design and distribution is not something the W3C should engage in. The W3C did what they should—provide a simple solution. If font designers want something more complicated, that’s up to them.</p>
<p>James, I just don’t see your system working. If IE and Firefox support @font-face foundries will have to either start licensing for the web at reasonable prices or start suing their customers. And the financial shape of the record industry suggests that suing customers is probably a bad way to go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d disagree with this - they see the professionally produced Open Source fonts (Vera, Droid, Liberation, Gentium) as being superior to the amateur efforts, and they see the amateur extensions to these fonts as being less than useful. Providing there are no restrictions on amateur development, they wont have a problem with quality gates being set on the official, blessed, versions of the fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I keep on going to the beginning of this thread to try and figure out what it&rsquo;s really about, and I haven&rsquo;t, but</p>
<p>&lsquo;The most serious problem being that only freeware fonts can be used, with the fonts web designers want to use [] completely off-limits, leading to fears that commercial fonts will be misused&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Designers&rsquo; are always going to want to use what is newest and coolest, and what the designer of what is new and cool has the most interest in defending . . . .</p>
<p>I am a little disturbed at stage 2 of the way MS is handling such fonts as Georgia and Verdana. At first they were freely available to everyone and Mac versions in particular were free. Then this dried up around the time, seemingly, that MS began to hope that Vista would be so great that it would wipe Macs off the planet. (Even Roger Black seems to have believed this &ndash; for a few seconds at least &ndash; and convinced me as well for a few seconds &ndash; long before anyone had actually seen the final of course.) Now, a few years later, that we know that Vista is surprisingly clumsy, and that Apple has nothing to fear, maybe MS could lead the way in committing to some really high quality classics to be available, free, in every format? MS has everything to gain from a limited philanthropic move of this kind. Isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;establishing standards&rsquo; what that company has always, principally, been about? Isn&rsquo;t that what makes it tick?</p>

<p>With respect to Georgia and Verdana, they were taken off of Microsoft.com in August 2002, less than a year after Windows XP shipped (quite a bit ahead of Vista). At that time they&rsquo;d been shipping with Mac OS for around four years (since 1997 I believe). The c. 1997 versions of the fonts are still available on Source Forge, and continue to be exploited by users of other platforms, Symbian, Linux, etc.,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Si, thanks very much for these dates. Yes, that&rsquo;s quite a bit ahead of Vista. I realize that it&rsquo;s impossible ever to know these things, but has anybody any idea why MS decided to make the newer versions of Georgia and Verdana platform-specific? Was it something so simple as that the newer versions were being optimized for ClearType and thus would be somewhat (not entirely!) wasted on other platforms? In any case I am truly delighted to hear that MS has made the 1997 versions available on Source Forge. That is really great!</p>
<p>And see? They&rsquo;re practically the only fonts since Times and Helvetica which have become absolute standards for the foreseeable future. The combination of ineffably excellent workmanship and unparalleled marketing muscle have won out. Whatever anybody talks about doing now, I think it will be a while before we see anything like this happen again. Type really is intangible, and the achievement of setting a new standard for hundreds of millions of users is a kind of miracle that can&rsquo;t be repeated for the wishing of it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I aver that the solution can only come about through the joint efforts of design and technique. (Who reads &lsquo;Computer Modern&rsquo;?) And though my respect for Bill Hill could not be greater, I can&rsquo;t help remembering the kerfuffle that arose when he patented sub-pixel positioning for Microsoft only to discover that the fundamental technology had already been disclosed by Wozniak at Apple about two decades before.</p>
<p>One could get the impression from many of Berlow&rsquo;s postings that he has some real communication problems. But go over to his blogs at rogerblack.com, and a careful examination will show that his mastery of every aspect of screen font rendering is unparalleled. As well, his ability to explain something, when you can finally get him to be serious, is exceptional. I learned a lot from spending a few minutes with these articles.</p>
<p>I will be spending some more time over there, trying to understand fully what is going on, but as I understand it now, Berlow&rsquo;s solution for better screen fonts is narrowly graded, size-specific scalable types. Perhaps not surprisingly, this is analogous to what Sumner Stone has found to be the only real solution for fine printing: narrowly-graded, size-specific, scalable, types. Surprise, ta-da. Just what we (I mean some of us) always suspected &ndash; those of us, that is, who <em>don&rsquo;t</em> think it is easy to make size-specific outlines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of work; it can&rsquo;t be done mechanically; it needs a vast understanding of the typographic language. After a comparatively short time floundering in type &ndash; 15 years &ndash; I can only identify three people who have, albeit overlappingly, an understanding of the joint technical and aesthetic problems we still need to solve: Carter, Stone, and Berlow. Apple, MS and the browser people can do what they want, and will, but without those three, preferably harnessed together, Apple, Microsoft and their collaborators, despite their justly lauded technical might, will never attain the goals they seek.</p>
<p>Is it unfair to name names? Well, posers have to be put in their place every so often.</p>

<p>Would it be safe to say that you see the delivery mechanism - whether that be the web fonts scheme, EOT, or something else is the least of our web troubles - because browsers and operating systems employ rendering strategies which are a. all different, b. all over the map, c. mostly undocumented, and d. changing?</p>
<p>I agree these are very valid concerns - one font may look super in Firefox but crappy in IE, work at 10pt in IE, but become illegible at 10pt in Safari.</p>
<p>I think this a valid issue for someone to raise during the panel (Roger maybe?) but getting browser makers and operating system makers to standardize on rendering seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Yea, that&rsquo;s a can of works too. I think web designers, who treat the web more as a content delivery platform, aren&rsquo;t that picky.

</blockquote>
<p>It all depends on how much you care about those variables. Adobe did &ndash; hence, in part, CoolType, an absolutely private screen rendering system now built into nearly all of its major apps. (i.e., figure out how to make ATM work on an app rather than a system basis, then figure out how to make it better than the versions you had to beg MS and Apple to include in their OS since customers never bought enough of it to make it worthwhile - - - and there&rsquo;s the rub. Customers never would pay for ATM and we wouldn&rsquo;t have it unless Adobe &ndash; bless &lsquo;em! &ndash; believed in it so much. Everyone who&rsquo;s building computer display systems (I mean that in the largest sense) knows what Adobe learnt: customers are really stingy. Sometimes you have to give away the best things if you care enough about the issues. And don&rsquo;t expect any thanks!)</p>
<p>But the variables all boil down to one thing: having the right font at the right grid for your system running your app in your view. This seems to be what Berlow is addressing practically.</p>

<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is that the &ldquo;reality&rdquo; of having more fonts available for web sites won&rsquo;t address the fundamental problem?</p>
<p>I somewhat agree, and will sign your petition (if written in plain English), much good may it do. Good luck with the scratching, biting and suing.</p>
<p>However, I suspect that the messy business of getting more fonts into play online, because we like them in print and big, irrespective of how well they render immersively on screen, would be a massive juicing of the typosphere and therefore a good situation for type business, whatever the legalities.</p>
<p>Much as I respect the technologically-driven MS designs (especially Verdana/Georgia and ClearType), they are a dull diet and don&rsquo;t give typographers anywhere near enough variety to work with.</p>
<p>I also wonder if too much importance isn&rsquo;t being given to the niceties of screen rendering, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Typophiles idealize the less-than-perfect effect of old letterpress printing (i.e. the concept of a good type design as one that can take a lot of abuse)</li>

<p>As to his points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Typophiles idealize the less-than-perfect effect of old letterpress printing (i.e. the concept of a good type design as one that can take a lot of abuse)&lt;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t why we idealize letterpress printing. We idealize it because each size can be perfectly optimized, which on a parallel level is what David is talking about. One of these days, Nick, you&rsquo;ll read an old book, and you&rsquo;ll get it.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Users can optimize screen type size to their liking—isn’t that the Big Idea?!&lt;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>No. The idea is that simple scaling &ndash; size &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; for a hundred and one reasons. We&rsquo;ve known this since the invention of the pantograph, but every now and then we need to be reminded. The problems are far worse than they were because of the limited resolution of smaller and smaller screen devices and the very slow progress to higher res (see below)</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Screens are getting finer all the time.&lt;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Where? Eight years ago, in 2000, Dell offered an inexpensive, pathbreaking 1600x1200 display on a 15&quot; laptop &ndash; that&rsquo;s 133 dpi. Two years later, Dell offered 1920x1200 &ndash; 150 dpi &ndash; on a 15&quot; machine. At present, Dell mainly offers 1920x1200 on a 17&quot; model, so we&rsquo;re back to 133 dpi.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s been six years since, quite cheaply (BTO addition of $100-200), we could get 150 dpi, and now we&rsquo;re offered less, rather than more.</p>
<p>Not to mention that it is <em>only</em> this year that Apple finally offered a 133 dpi screen - - at last - - as a special BTO option on its 17&quot; laptop.</p>
<p>Not to mention that David (and others) had been using 120 dpi CRTs since back - - when? the late 80s? Basically 20 years ago? I know I had them in 1992. Sigmas? And 150 dpi was available by the mid-90s.</p>
<p>So the sad truth is that in 20 years, we have not (except for some very high end equipment used in medical and other applications) been able to get much further than the 120 dpi we could achieve back then.</p>
<p>This is not, Nick, a case of screens &lsquo;getting finer all the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the progress is so slow, but it is.</p>
<p>By the way, the 600 dpi LCD that Xerox touted quite some time ago was, it appeared on further inspection . . . a 150 dpi screen with subpixel anti-aliasing . . . . . . .</p>
<p>Indeed the entire reason that subpixel anti-aliasing has had to be invented (I mean implemented) is that screen resolution has been essentially static for 20 years. Why this should be so, I don&rsquo;t know . . . . . probably mainly because most users don&rsquo;t care. Just like most users don&rsquo;t care about size-optimized type, whether it&rsquo;s in print or on screen. They can recognize that it is superior, but they&rsquo;re not going to make a compelling economic case for it.</p>

<p>So where does the money for all of the font optimizing come from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My conclusion is that it must now come from love. Font optimization reached its apotheosis in the pre-WW2 period because of the unique economics of the competition between Linotype and Monotype. It was the <em>only</em> thing they could do to make viable competitive cases for themselves, and the payoffs were huge. Those conditions no longer exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not that we shouldn’t push for better on-screen rendering, but by the time something might come of that, if we’re lucky, improvements in hardware will make it somewhat moot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. The best technology we have today can barely move around pixels at 133 dpi. Suppose we actually had 600 dpi screens tomorrow? The video hardware just isn&rsquo;t up to it, not to mention the rest of the hardware. It could be longer than one might think - - a couple of decades? - - for substantial improvements to be made and purveyed cheaply.</p>
<p>We need solutions that recognize the hardware where it is. Dave Ericsson, whose DOS-based XyWrite, still in use, was and is legendary for speed, always tested the program exclusively on hardware several years out of date. Can you see Microsoft forcing its Office and Vista teams to use only five-year-old computers? If they did, we&rsquo;d have much better software . . . . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;That isn’t why we idealize letterpress printing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True. But it is why much of the general market idealizes (or even idolizes) it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The idea is that simple scaling — size — doesn’t work&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, true for type designers, but probably just fine for most folks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the sad truth is that in 20 years, we have not&hellip;been able to get much further than the 120 dpi we could achieve back then.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Sigh</em>. That is true. Nearly everything in computing has improved at an exponential rate (storage sizes, memory sizes, processor speeds, printer quality, color depth, size) EXCEPT for display resolution.</p>
<p>That said, we&rsquo;re on the cusp of perhaps a long-overdue bump. The iPhone is at 166ppi. The Sony reader is at 170ppi. Still a long ways to go, but finally picking up a bit of momentum. Also keep in mind that screen ppi and print dpi shouldn&rsquo;t be compared via a 1-1 correlation given that type on paper is typically limited to 1 color, while a screen can take advantage of the color spectrum (though that does then get us back to wanting better screen optimized type&hellip;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It’s nonsensical to claim that IE has ≈75% market share, so Microsoft has to go along with this business if everyone else does.</p>
<p>First, which version of IE? 7 is much better than 6, which is barely even a browser in any rational definition of the term.</p>
<p>Who’s going to want to use Web fonts? A few Flash assholes, maybe, sure, but mostly standardistas of the Jason Santa Maria ilk. The only browsers they use are good ones; maybe they test certain layouts in IE7, but that will be it for pages that use Web fonts. Importantly, the readers of the sites that use Web fonts also will be using at least IE7, IE8, or, much more rationally, Firefox or Safari.</p>
<p>Hence, if Web fonts take off for all browsers other than IE*, they will have taken off for the vast majority of the developer audience that wants to use them and the reader audience that wants to look at them.</p>
<p>P.S. I always love it when you kids use the phrase “Web standards.” I accept that Si is using it nonironically.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David you may be right but what about this: Regarding new graphics. Most web sites are re-designed every few years. That&rsquo;s how we went from a 800x600 web to a 1024x768 web.</p>
<p>And since we are going to have a long tail it is likely that graphics/code for layout(css) will keep becoming more &amp; more flexible. This is already starting to happen a bit. Probably that will continue and greater flex will be built in via flash and css.</p>
<p>And the MS &amp; Apple tech that lets you soon in to see something closer &amp; zoom out for context is starting to see more &amp; more play. That will have an impact too - although it&rsquo;s hard for me to say what it is. It will make rez specific designs harder to justify though. Sadly. I like the idea very much as I have said before.</p>
<p>Also OLEDs have made a lot of advances. And their rez is pretty insanely high. And could go higher. Plus they take less energy to run but that is a side issue except in that they will be attractive for that reason.</p>
<p>200ppi is what OLED makers are starting to shoot for &amp; apparently a lab somewhere has done a sample at 300ppi.</p>
<p>So is the &ldquo;rez fairy&rdquo; = 80% of people with 200ppi+ in 10 years? If I am gonna say &ldquo;I believe&rdquo; then I need to know what I am supposedly believing in.</p>
<p>And chip speeds including graphics engine chips do somehow keep getting better.</p>
<p>None of this means that it will be other than a mess or even that it won&rsquo;t be even more of a mess than it is today.</p>
<p>The people that have a real clue about this are keeping mum because it&rsquo;s their job to do so until it&rsquo;s time for a marketing blitz.</p>
<p>But to sum up: What&rsquo;s the standard? Draw that line in the sand past which exists the rez fairy.</p>

<p>Nick, the handful of faces aren&rsquo;t “preferred.” There are only a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web#The_fonts|handful of faces]] “offered” or available for web design using CSS and HTML. Recall the quote from the OP “&hellip;the fonts web designers want to use are completely off-limits&hellip;” As Joe Clark can explain to you in some detail I&rsquo;m sure, using Cochin for text means having to employ “text as image” or SIFR or SWF. All of those solutions can have major drawbacks — like taking ten hours to edit text instead of ten minutes.</p>
<p>The solution is pretty damn simple. But most of the type designers act as if the world will end if Cochin is allowed to be embedded and uploaded to a hosting server.</p>

<p>Web sites may be designed to use system fonts.
So, e.g. Cochin may be put at the front of the font specification code list, followed by Constantia.
That way, Mac users get Cochin, and PC users get Constantia.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know it, but he&rsquo;s echoing something one of the late great men of type, the much-loved Robert Norton (who among other things in a long, important life in type brought Matthew Carter to Microsoft if memory serves) wrote about David Berlow more than 15 years ago:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We first learned to love Berlow when he was at Bitstream, when we could rely on him for ironic comments on whatever show or seminar we happened to be at. It became harder to love him as his career progressed and Font Bureau was started and shouldered its way into what is known as the &lsquo;leading ledge&rsquo; of font technology and it became clear that he was getting to know more than the rest of us. Perhaps the reason we are still delighted to eat with him is that he hasn&rsquo;t yet got round to rubbing our noses in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, nothing has changed. Berlow still knows more than the rest of us - - and he still doesn&rsquo;t rub our noses in it - - even when they&rsquo;re a bit snotty.</p>
<p>Nick, reading your post, it seems your insight is that Cochin is more readable than Georgia. Am I misreading something?</p>
<p>Gosh! At this rate, maybe someday someone somewhere will call me polite.</p>

<p>The first paragraph reads,</p>
<p>&lsquo;For a few short years in the early 1990s, Robert Norton had a decisive influence on something the great majority of us use and take for granted: the typefaces that accompanied a whole slew of Microsoft software products, including Microsoft Windows and software available for the Mac. Norton was &ldquo;the cornerstone of Microsoft&rsquo;s type group,&rdquo; as Nicolas Barker put it in his obituary in the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo; He was largely responsible for the selection and creation of typefaces for Windows and all other Microsoft software, including Word and Office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Norton did a lot of big things. One of them was saving Monotype from disappearing; without him, one can now see, there would be no Monotype, no Agfa, no Linotype. And so much else. And yet could take time out to critique something as unimportant as my early work which, by the way, Joe Clarke &lsquo;disapproved&rsquo; of.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe typefaces have inherent readability.
Nothing happens till a face is set in a particular layout and read by a particular person in a particular environment.
For this thread, following David&rsquo;s lead, I set Cochin small in TextEdit, compared it with Georgia, and rather liked the effect of its small x-height. 
Perhaps it is like an amber ale, great in small amounts&ndash;but then, the Web is all about a tipple here, a tipple there.
Why drown in the same old fonts all the time?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, I believe in the Resolution Fairy. Webpages? Safari will scale &lsquo;em. They&rsquo;ll be a bit fuzzier than the UI because the display will be re-rendering the whole appearance of the webpage while still making the links and stuff work. It will probably take a 32-core processor and 8GB or RAM to do this. Fortunately, these things are only a couple years away. Storage for all these graphics? My first computer had a 100MB hard drive. My current setup, which is actually fairly modest includes 1TB of storage, approximately 10,000 times the capacity. In a couple years I&rsquo;ll plug in a 100TB drive and wonder where my free space went.</p>
<p>Apple, and maybe others will do this. Why? They have to keep selling computers to stay in business. They can&rsquo;t just sell me one computer and be done with it. They have to convince me to buy 4 or 5 computers per decade. They rewrote almost everything to get me to buy OS X, and I had to buy new hardware to run it. They&rsquo;ll rewrite everything again soon so that I have to buy more hardware. Replace my LCD? Oh, yeah. Apple would prefer I do this each product cycle. Huge, publicly traded companies are depending on me to throw away everything I currently have. I would type more, but I have to go stand in line to buy a new iPhone.</p>

<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t need to improve their resolution to convince people to do that. People do that already… even I do that already. I&rsquo;ve bought four Mac laptops: 1999, 2003, 2006 (beginning), 2007 (end). Before 2009, I might not buy another one. But in 2010? If I were Apple, I&rsquo;d make that wager…</p>
<p>Plus, I&rsquo;ve bough two iPods (2003, 2006), and I&rsquo;m planning on getting an iPhone 3G in November. Come to think about it, the iPhone is almost like a computer…</p>

<p>More to the point however, the type designer/manufacturer can’t control people re-sizing the TYPE. It hardly matters though, if you can &lsquo;give them&rsquo; any size.</p>
<p>This &lsquo;any size&rsquo; problem is what TrueType Technology and TrueType Outline Fonts, were invented for, before being seized upon with greedy paws that liken eyeballs to dust.</p>
<p>What I showed on RB&rsquo;s site was: IF, TrueType Technology and TrueType Outline Font hints &lsquo;worked&rsquo; across anti-aliasing platforms, then this is what it could look like.</p>
<p>What the first Latin letterpresser, (ever), did, was similar: IF, someone can figure out how to mass produce metal letters cheaply, then this is what letters pressed to paper with ink between, could look like.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What David is saying is this &ndash; I think:</p>
<p>You are sitting in front of a 24&quot; monitor that has 1920x1200 resolution. You are sitting exactly two feet away. You are looking at ten point type that is (let&rsquo;s say) 15 pixels high at nominal &lsquo;100%&rsquo; magnification. This particular type is 100% optimized for this absolutely particular viewing situation.</p>
<p>IF you change <em>either</em> the <em>viewing distance</em>, or the <em>magnification</em>, you will only get <em>optimal viewing</em> if the <em>type parameters</em> (design) change as well.</p>
<p>We can and should be able to implement this. It is what was achieved in letterpress for carefully calculated average viewing distances. (Same principle in photographic/optical depth of field calculations, all of which have are calibrated for an &lsquo;average&rsquo; viewing distance which the person calculating depth of field can control if he disagrees with received wisdom.)</p>
<p>About 8 years ago, someone from the MS typography group stated, on the OpenType list, that optical size masters in multiple master fonts were not needed because truetype and Postscript fonts are <em>scalable</em>. This seemed to reflect MS values at the time. Now older and wiser, it may be time to rethink this.</p>
<p>In the infancy of pantographic use, types were designed at different sizes from a single master, and the effect was exactly the same as simple type scaling is today. But once the competition heated up, and good optical scaling became a competitive agenda, the great era of Lino and Mono optical scaling began (let&rsquo;s say roughly 1920 to 1960) and there was a substantially different design for every type size (give or take a point).</p>
<p>Could something like this happen again? Yes, if someone cared to demonstrate that optically-optimized design really could enhance not just print but screen reading, and that there was a practical way to implement this cross-browser, cross-platform, cross-rendering system.</p>
<p>But I have to say, until you know what size monitor, resolution, and viewing distance are, you can&rsquo;t set optimal parameters. The solution is for the system to be able to know the monitor size and resolution and for an average viewing distance to be used which could, by user control, be changed. All of this is possible.</p>
<p>We would then have screen/print reading experiences that were superior to what we have now.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that this will happen. There comes a point when you run out of creditable new features and you have to go back to multiple master/variation type.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, tech news blogs are filled with the news that MS is investing 500 million dollars (!@!!!) to advertise that Vista isn&rsquo;t really as bad as everyone thinks it is.</p>
<p>Anyone care, now, to bet on how long it will take MS to discover optically optimized type? Better start reading letterpress books, those of you who want to make some $$$ on the new crest that will emerge sometime in the next three or four years.</p>

<p>Sorry, no.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person can look at printed type from many distances, and there is always sharp detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharp detail per se is not what we&rsquo;re looking at (just as in photography, we&rsquo;re looking at edge sharpness rather than &lsquo;resolution&rsquo;).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going way beyond that: optimum viewing experience through optimum design of type for that size. Nick, study enlarged samples of metal Bembo (or Times New Roman) from 6 or 7 points up to 14 points, and you&rsquo;ll get one corner of the argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the optimum reading distance has little to do with resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about optimum reading distance, but optimum font design for a given size and magnification of font at a given reading distance. The term is &lsquo;average reading distance&rsquo; &ndash; that is, the distance at which most people are going to view a book or monitor. Resolution, at this point, doesn&rsquo;t even enter into the argument. For these purposes, we can temporarily assume that resolution is almost infinite (as indeed, is just beginning to happen, as you pointed out in another recent thread).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, when one views a monitor, the optimum distance is very much dependent on resolution: it is that distance ever so slightly beyond the threshold of being able to discern the LCD grid. In other words, the reader is as close to the image (figure) as possible without the grid (ground) interfering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a useful formula either, because it dictates that the higher the resolution, the closer you will sit to the monitor. So: if you have a 75 dpi monitor, say, it&rsquo;s two feet; if it&rsquo;s 150 dpi, it&rsquo;s one foot; at 300 dpi, it&rsquo;s six inches. You see why that&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going out on a limb here, but I think David could not be making the points he&rsquo;s making if he was worrying about resolution. I think the fact that we&rsquo;re getting beyond resolution per se is one of the key things we have to consider as we plan for better type (more pleasing, more legible) in the next decade or two.</p>
<p>Resolution is a significant part of the story, but it&rsquo;s not the major part. We also can&rsquo;t begin to calculate average reading distance per se without considering the size of the monitor. If it&rsquo;s 100 dpi and 15 inches, there will be one distance; if it&rsquo;s 100 dpi and 30 inches, there will be another distance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to consider, but optical optimization (different design for different sizes) is foremost.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Why is resolution secondary? Because it doesn&rsquo;t come first.</p>
<p>Consider letterpress. Resolution is almost unlimited, provided that print size and print quality are appropriately matched. Yet you cannot have good quality unless you have different designs for each size. So that&rsquo;s our primary concern, our cornerstone, in thinking through the system.</p>
<p>Once that is settled, <em>then</em> is the time you have to consider resolution, because you can&rsquo;t throw fonts at the system that it can&rsquo;t resolve well. Historically, Microsoft has been less interested in knowing a lot of specifics about the user&rsquo;s system because it had too many systems to support, unlike Apple. But there is no reason to suppose that Microsoft will continue in this way as display systems evolve. Microsoft is likely to do whatever it takes to be at the forefront and I believe already has most of the technology in place to do this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the concern up til now has been worldwide support of languages. Solving this has been far from easy, and has been much more important than anything else. People who understood this early &ndash; John Hudson was the one who got it soonest and got it best &ndash; have done well in this period. But that is almost done now.</p>
<p>So what next?</p>
<p>One OS or the other is going to have a superior font technology sometime within the next decade. The others will follow suit because they won&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>At that point, OS makers will be competing for superior visual experience in just the way that Mono and Lino did in the early to mid-20th century. I worry that the three people in the font business who really understand optical optimization &ndash; Carter, Stone, and Berlow &ndash; won&rsquo;t necessarily be interested in participating by the time their expertise is needed. But people got the expertise quickly in the early 20th century when they needed it. They&rsquo;ll get it again, when they have to. It&rsquo;s all happened before. We&rsquo;re almost literally tracking, for the screen, what people were doing with print exactly a hundred years ago. &lsquo;Eternal recurrence of the same&rsquo; anyone?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;You are sitting exactly two feet away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so much concerned about reader distance in this area, which is why I&rsquo;ve put the required care into sizes from 8 to 16 pixels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not so much concerned about optical sizes, as I am with optimal sizes.</p>
<p>I make rounding decisions based on basic optical sizing principles, but at &lsquo;the bottom&rsquo; there isn&rsquo;t much room for whole pixel changes. Weight, I do them all, so that&rsquo;s optically done. Cap hts are to the max and x-ht is too. So, only the spacing and the width are open for optical improvements, and again, there I&rsquo;m going after all useful spacing and width solutions in text.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; the reader is as close to the image (figure) as possible without the grid (ground) interfering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe this is correct Nick, but that the grid is &lsquo;everywhere&rsquo;, as you know. Users naturally gravitate to a distance where smoothness wins. Unfortunately, CT, with it&rsquo;s double rendering, is quite frequently smoothing pre-obfuscated contours to the point where the type is spineless mush, except for mine, and Verdana at 11, which is what it was drawn for. I&rsquo;ve found myself trying to find a correct size/distance ratio on Vista, that never becomes comfortable. It looks like a-a type, but it ain&rsquo;t quite.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Sharp detail per se is not what we’re looking at</em></p>
<p>Yes it is.
The eye focuses on what it&rsquo;s looking at.
With printed type, especially letterpress, the reader can read from a variety of distances and focus on a sharp image.
But monitors don&rsquo;t work like that, because anti-aliased text is never sharp.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re looking at text on screen, and it&rsquo;s blurry, because it&rsquo;s anti-aliased.
Detail is missing.
What&rsquo;s the natural thing to do in this circumstance?
Move closer, under the assumption, which works elsewhere in the world, that this will reveal more detail. 
So you move closer until the grid starts to interfere, to the point &ldquo;where smoothness wins&rdquo;.
This has nothing to do with fonts and reading, it&rsquo;s basic physiology.</p>
<p>Just a theory.
I wonder if there are any studies on reading distances for computer screens of different resolution and size.</p>

<p>Chris, that&rsquo;s extremely important, and often overlooked by people who didn&rsquo;t transition from non-GUI to GUI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a small group of users (including me) still use DOS-based XyWrite (which works fine under Vista and is usable on Mac and Linux) for writing. The black screen with white letters is still considerably less straining. This is a problem that the GUI world has yet to solve.</p>
<p>One of the reasons, of course, why the early GUI&rsquo;s were black text on white is that it makes fonts look perceptibly sharper.</p>

<p>Nick, this is absolute nonsense. You&rsquo;ve apparently not recently worked in a large office. Everyone who employs people who are to look at screens all day has a great interest in keeping those people healthy: not producing vision problems, repetitive motion injuries, etc. To this end, computer operators (e.g. secretaries) often are (and all should be) given guidance as to posture, proper viewing distance, etc. The screen is not there to dictate the distance. It is the <em>image</em>  that dictates the distance. And if the distance is wrong, you change the image. That&rsquo;s what computers are for.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;formula&rsquo; &ndash; hitherto undisclosed? &ndash; whereby viewing distance decreases as resolution increases is nonsense and if taken seriously would give rise to potentially irreversible injury. If you insist on clinging to it, at least give us some references. IF, by the remotest chance, you have read this somewhere &ndash; and do please cite &ndash; I think you will find that the system being studied did not have scalable type. Since all systems for the past umpteen years have had scalable type, this is not relevant. The ONLY system where you would have to move closer as resolution increases is one where type size also decreases. That is not the case today. We adjust the type size upwards as resolution increases.</p>
<p>Please consider also that many computer operators will be wearing glasses which dictate the proper viewing distance - - typically between two and three feet, 18-24 inches, whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we look at any close object, our eyes do two things: They accommodate and converge. Both of these can contribute to eyestrain. (Collins 1975 and Fischer 1977).&rdquo;</p>
<p>(See <a href="http://www.office-ergo.com/viewing.htm">http://www.office-ergo.com/viewing.htm</a> for example, for some factual information on optimum viewing distances.)</p>
<p>As to this interesting point that anti-aliased type is not sharp, and therefore users move closer to monitors, this betrays a miscomprehension of perceived sharpness. Most of the world is happily sitting much further away from its monitors, thanks to anti-aliased type and most particularly ClearType, whatever its other faults may be. And this is a good thing.</p>
<p>The reason why I am typing this comfortably on a high resolution screen from three feet away at a small point size is that ClearType is so good that it looks sharp, tiny, from three feet away. Hundreds of millions are happily sharing the same experience at this very moment.</p>
<p>It is not, as Kodak discovered in the early 1950s (see the early studies on acutance by Jones et al.; the later ones on M(odulation) T(ransfer) F(unction)), conventionally measurable sharpness that is important. It is what the eye perceives as sharpness. And nearly all of us find good anti-aliased type vastly sharper. This lets us have a good computing experience with proper posture and comfortable viewing distance.</p>
<p>The various anti-aliasing systems may be open to criticism. But what is not open to question is the fact that for the vast majority of users, anti-aliasing is, literally, a blessing which lets us sit further from our machines. And the further away the better. That is what we want; that is what a good office will insist upon; that is accepted ergonomic practice.</p>
<p>Finally, Chris, back to the excessive brightness of today&rsquo;s GUIs. It is not generally known that most monitors are set far too bright. Guidance as to their proper setting in given environments can be found at <a href="http://www.displaymate.com">www.displaymate.com</a></p>
<p>And now, could we get back to the question how to make our viewing experiences even better?</p>

<p>You have to! And if you&rsquo;re nearsighted, and wear specs for 20/20, you can get a weaker prescription optimized for 2-3 feet if you have to spend a lot of time in front of screens.</p>
<p>One of the problems with Fontlab is that a lot of onscreen information you need is not visible unless you&rsquo;re 6-12 inches from the screen - - Fog somehow does this much better.</p>
<p>The white screen really is an occupational hazard for font designers. Oh well. The sublime Bram de Does had to give up all his letterpress kit last year because of a lead allergy.</p>

<p>T1 doesn&rsquo;t use the TT instruction language, and in a pinch, it won&rsquo;t allow em resolution greater than 1000. 
So, one does not have explicit enough hints to address the lower resolutions. TT has &lsquo;instructions&rsquo;. In extreme designs, like very thin, heavy, wide or condensed, one runs out of resolution — places to put points at 1000 are not so easy in extreme faces, in the T1 flavor, (which is probably why one doesn&rsquo;t see much stylistic extremism coming from 300 dpi-o-centic T1-only founders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;..do you mean width as in sidebearings or width as in varying the actual width of the glyph?&rdquo;
These two things are inseparable, if I understand the question.</p>
<p>Sii: &ldquo;&hellip; before David come[s] back and tells us all off for going OT&rdquo; 
I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve done that, nor will I&hellip; ever.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting discussion… As a designer I know what I aim for in the reading experience. I call it ‘even colour’. I want the page to look balanced (or not, but that is intentionally) by using various cuts and sizes that balance out. A crude way to measure this is by looking thru your eyelashes, when details fall away and the tonality of a design appears.</p>
<p>I think that this principle could be applied to the reading experience of a page (text) on a screen. A computer could compute the ‘colour’ of the image on the monitor. It should even be able to set a personal preference that would change the parameters of the display of type on the fly. Eg I zoom in, and the type adjusts to even out the colour, with finer serifs, less letterspacing, perhaps a different level of anti-aliasing, etcetera.</p>
<p>Computational power has increased enormously, so it would be feasible to inroduce this kind of intelligence. Or am I wrong?</p>

Bert Vanderveen BNO</p>
<p>PS Example right here: in it’s standard form the Georgia I see now does not have enough contrast due to the gray background Typophile employs. Hitting the Plus-key two times solves that, but introduces a new problem: not enough text in my viewport. In other words: Typophiles design does not scale well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Bert, I really can&rsquo;t agree. I think it&rsquo;s just because the contrast is lower that the site is a comfortable read where people are tempted to spend time. &ndash; i.e., attempting to distinguish between one second&rsquo;s worth of peak legibility as a different phenomenon than two hours worth of comfortable legibility. High contrast is always a knockout, grab &lsquo;em right away phenomenon. But it costs: it costs all the subtleties of micro-gradation, it costs long-term viewing comfort, etc. etc. High contrast is for the moment; lower contrast is for the whole day, as I see it.</div>

<p>Totally brilliant answer - - a classic. Like when panicky newspaper designer in way above his head asks MC at what point in the process he does fitting, and MC replies, &lsquo;when I&rsquo;m first designing the letter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What I thought might be possible, as size goes down, is scheme whereby interletter space was being increased without necessarily changing the shape of the letter, analogous to positive tracking.</p>
<p>I had thought there were ways to get around the T1 1000 em, but I guess they&rsquo;re not reliable? So, it&rsquo;s the too-small design space and the lack of instructions? As simple as that? You would think, by now, T1 would have evolved somewhat. Also at some point I thought I was given to understand by David Lemon that some kind of floating point direction was capable of being accepted by Postscript. But what interpreters would respect that, and when? I can&rsquo;t think why the system doesn&rsquo;t simply evolve. Why not give T1 a fabulous instruction set, open up the em, and build in some of the TT-Variations-like-stuff that Adobe was internally testing way back when as a kind of super multiple master in T1? I guess it was intended to be MM 2.0?</p>

Well, one can use any Emsize in the world in development, but then when you make fonts, the scaling is done unhinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, it’s the too-small design space and the lack of instructions?&rdquo;
Are you talking about ClearType now? Same problem, after all, too-small design space borne of not enough resolution, and a lack-o-instruction as to which instructions work&hellip;</p>

<p>ah - - -</p>
<p>David, is that related to what I learnt ages ago - - that when a T1 font goes outside the 1000 em space, the interpreter automatically scales it to 1000? If so, when that happens, hints are always lost? (of course, of course) And does that happen with Adobe Caslon which I think goes slightly out of the 1000 em space?</p>
<p>And here I thought all these live long days, and years, that I was right to cleave to T1 and support it any way I could. Such that I don&rsquo;t even know how to edit in TT !</p>
<p>OK, well here&rsquo;s a practical question. I have a family in Fog 4/5 outlines that uses floating point points to advantage. In the display master, there are plenty of small distances like 3.4 units that one really wouldn&rsquo;t want to round off to 3.</p>
<p>If I want to continue working on this project, what&rsquo;s my best move forward with my existing data - - convert to TT with a larger em space, thus preserving much of my data&rsquo;s integrity, and then ultimately package as .otf and hope that nobody knows it isn&rsquo;t PS? (since everybody &lsquo;knows&rsquo; somehow that good printing is always done with PS fonts?)</p>
<p>And all of that said, what do I have to do to make sure that a really high-res TT font gets accurately printed and not somehow rounded off into converted T1?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to have to ask the questions in 2008 - - you would have thought it would all be obvious now - - that problems like this simply could not exist. . . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;when a T1 font goes outside the 1000 em space, the interpreter automatically scales it to 1000? &quot;
I don&rsquo;t think this happens. The 1,000 em is defined in an 8,000 universe, into which all the points must fit.  TT has a similar situation, where it has a huge universal value (16k or 32k?) &lsquo;surrounding&rsquo; the 2048, (or whatever your TT em is), that also cannot be exceeded by point positions. Now, if your instructions take a point beyond the universe&hellip; you&rsquo;d have to ask Jefferson Starship, over at MS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, when that happens, hints are always lost?&rdquo;
In order for them to be &lsquo;lost&rsquo;, they&rsquo;d have there in the first place. Hints are only added at output of the product, and are (sadly to this futurist), not used in the design process, only defined there by (hu)man or machine for use at output, or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;have a family in Fog 4/5 outlines that uses floating point points to advantage.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m not sure what the advantage is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the display master, there are plenty of small distances like 3.4 units that one really wouldn’t want to round off to 3.&rdquo;
But do round to 3 when you generate T1 fonts&hellip; This is not a big deal, this 3.4 to 3.0, unless you have a bunch of 3.x that you want to &lsquo;round together&rsquo; and some are more than 3.499999, or whatever FOG not/3.5 does with all that, in my opinion wastefully useless resolution. This extra-super-high-resolution in Fog not/3.5 issue, was stupidly keeping up with a 1990 URW claim that more is more, and if you don&rsquo;t have it you can&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now a dead issue, except in Fog not/3.5. The cleverest way to define the resolution of a font is to do so at the resolution or within the range you expect the use to be, but only if you don&rsquo;t know exact the size/res combination(s). So, if you expect PS use, design on a 1000 em, (not 10,000 or a million), and thus be sure that what points you placed will Stay! until the user needs to scale them. And then, you pray for resolution on their output. Or, if you think their output is a lot less than 1,000 per em, hint. Or finally, if you think their output is a whole lot less than 1,000, convert to TT and a 512, 1024 or 2048 em, and write instructions. All of this is advice to the picky, until resolution fails, not needless to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;what do I have to do to make sure that a really high-res TT font gets accurately printed and not somehow rounded off into converted T1?&rdquo;
Move to Mars, take up ice fishing, or etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;- - you would have thought it would all be obvious now - - that problems like this simply could not exist. . . .&rdquo;
Font format development by slow, stubborn, and sustained accretion, leaves tons of problems. It used to be called &ldquo;Font Wars&rdquo;, but for marketing reasons, now it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;OpenType.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, I think you&rsquo;re confusing Type1 and OpenType here, and you mean <em>OpenType CFF</em> when you say <em>Type1,</em> right? As far as I know, there is no other limitation for upm values than that it must be between 16 and 16384 in OpenType fonts, no matter if they have TT or PS outlines (but powers of 2 are recommended for TT outlines).</p>
<p>So for your 3.4 units at 1000 upm, you should set an upm size where it rounds to a full unit, for absolute precision you would need 17 units on a 5000 upm grid.</p>

<p>Does that mean you don&rsquo;t know the answer, Thomas? And not that anyone asked you. When I need to know something from Adobe, I go a few levels higher. And speaking of misleading, why don&rsquo;t you do something about those shocking blogs of yours which tell everyone to ditch pre-CFF and MM? I think I finally get it about MS: those fonts will always be supported. It&rsquo;s one thing, Thomas, to be a trusted provider of technical information. It&rsquo;s another to spread misinformation, like &lsquo;I sure wouldn&rsquo;t buy a font in Mac or Windows Type 1 or Mac TrueType format today&rsquo;; &lsquo;Type 1 is a thoroughly obsolete format&rsquo;; &lsquo;so saying that Windows Vista won&rsquo;t support Type 1 is not exactly true&rsquo; &ndash; I&rsquo;m quoting from your official Adobe-sponsored legal-approved blogs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you mean OpenType CFF when you say Type1,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Jens, kind of. I guess I should just say Postscript. My fault for not clarifying that I use T1 generally to mean any PS, and also use T1 specifically to mean pre-CFF-T1 when discussing scaling from greater than 1000 down to 1000. Obviously I need to be more precise. What David Lemon told me in the early 90s was that a font that exceeds 1000 units vertically will be automatically scaled down to 1000, and that it would be OK to exceed 1000 but not recommended. At that time, very few Adobe fonts did this, but Adobe Caslon was one of them. What does that do to hinting?</p>
<p>And thank you very much for your advice. But how do I resolve that it appears to conflict with David&rsquo;s?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>David, that&rsquo;s the funniest thing I have ever heard about OT in these 12 long years. 
Thank you. Laughing is more important than anything, even type. Et maintenant, il faut cultiver notre jardin.</p>

<p>That was an application issue I believe, related to a problem most apps have solved without scaling the glyph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that do to hinting?&rdquo;
My understanding was that it threw out the hinting when this scaling was done to the glyph.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Speaking of hinting, discarded or otherwise, leads me to a question posed by the location of the dot in i of Berthold Bembo. The extreme left of the dot is located at 75.5 PS units. This is of course accomplished by not having a collinear left point.</p>
<p>In my very first PS fonts, I used to digitize like this, convinced that I needed to be in these intermediate spaces for reasons of aesthetic purity. However, I was soon convinced to stop this practice, on the grounds that proper PS hinting could not occur even in the absence of collinear points. Later on, in the late 90s when I was working with Adobe, I was told that, for example, it was not necessary to worry about having collinearity at the edge of a rounded serif, but that it was important for the main features of a glyph.</p>
<p>Where are we now?  ?  ?  ?</p>
<p>In this era of anti-aliased screen type, what do we have to worry about in simple PostScript? <em>Should</em> the extrema of the dot in i invariably be located with a collinear point? What else should we, and should we not, worry about with contemporary rendering technologies? I mean of course on a very basic level. Most of us are not hinting experts and will not have the budget to send our fonts to hinting experts.</p>
<p>The advantage of abandoning collinearity is that you have the ability to get into intermediate spaces off the T1 1000 grid that would otherwise not be accessible. Under what circumstances does this advantage, visible in a font editor, translate into actual printable utility? What are the disadvantages?</p>

The same place. If T1 hinting does not effect a particular kind of feature, or the points that describe it, then its point locations are not important. On a very basic level, if you are targeting PS output at resolutions higher than 600 with fonts bigger than 6 pt, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advantage of abandoning collinearity is that you have the ability to get into intermediate spaces off the T1 1000 grid that would otherwise not be accessible.&rdquo;
What intermediate spaces off the T1 1000?</p>

<p>Is flex still important? How do cupped serifs react to anti-aliasing? What if a cupped serif is made by having the central point on the baseline and the corners at -2? What happens then?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see a conflict there, because we were talking about different things: David about how glyphs get scaled down when they don&rsquo;t fit into the (1000 x 1000 unit) em square, while I was talking about that you should use OpenType-CFF and raise the Units Per Em value of your font if you need higher precision that a grid of 1000 units, e.g. to 5000 so that 3.4/1000 units turn into 17/5000 units.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry, Jens, I think I misunderstood what David said. He wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, if you expect PS use, design on a 1000 em, (not 10,000 or a million), and thus be sure that what points you placed will Stay! until the user needs to scale them. And then, you pray for resolution on their output.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took this to mean I should confine myself to 1K/em. But rereading, I noticed the next sentence,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or, if you think their output is a lot less than 1,000 per em, hint.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now I think what he was saying was design for greater than 1K/em if you feel you have to (though he elsewhere says that he thinks IK&rsquo;s 15,000 is a waste), but &hellip;.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m totally confused! &ndash; and there are all those other questions.</p>
<p>David, I later stated,</p>
<p>“The advantage of abandoning collinearity is that you have the ability to get into intermediate spaces off the T1 1000 grid that would otherwise not be accessible.”</p>
<p>You then correctly asked, &ldquo;What intermediate spaces off the T1 1000?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of &ldquo;off&rdquo; I should have written &ldquo;within&rdquo; and what I meant by the intermediate space was, for example, the extreme left of the dot of i occurring at 75.5 units, which is only possible when you abandon collinear points at the extrema.</p>
<p>Many thanks for expert help! Sorry to be so dense!</p>
