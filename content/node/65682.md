body: "Hi folks, new to the forum, but consider myself a neophyte type snob (that
  is, still a beginner, but I am a type nut nonetheless).\r\nI am a student, and purchased
  the Adobe Font Folio (academic), so I already own such faces as Helvetica, Avenir,
  Univers, Futura, etc etc,plus the faces that come with OS X and Adobe CS4.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I lack is a really complete slab-serif family of fonts. I am thinking that purchasing
  a good slab-serif font would be a really useful addition to my library, so I am
  currently considering Jos' Museo Slab family or H&FJ's Archer. I see Archer everywhere,
  however, and I don't want to invest in a library that could soon be ubiquitous/overused
  (if it isn't already...)\r\n\r\nOther faces I'm considering: Gotham, Verlag, some
  nice brush scripts like Alpine Script... maybe a combination of fonts. However,
  I can only afford spending up to <b>$300 on fonts.</b> I see the merit in getting
  one high-quality family (or at least a subset of a family) and learning how to use
  it really well.\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate your feedback!"

    Caecilia]] is a humanist slab, very nice for some clean looking text. The heavy

  body: "I have looked through all the suggestions and I will try to answer some of
    your questions. I confess, I do not quite understand all the nuances between styles
    of slab-serif. In terms of pure subjective taste, I prefer slabs that are more
    geometric, with very little contrast between thick/thin strokes, which Museo and
    Archer seem to fit quite well. I stumbled across House Industries' Neutraface
    Slab last night, and am really considering that or Neutraface No 2.\r\n\r\nI like
    The Serif from LucasFonts, but it feels awfully similar to Chaparral to me, which
    I own, and I'm looking for building up as much diversity in my font library as
    possible. On my sticky note of serious considerations, I now have the following:
    <b>Archer, Museo Slab, Neutraface Slab, Neutraface 2, and Gotham.</b>\r\n\r\nI'm
    delighted to see you frequent these forums, Jos! I feel like I've stumbled upon
    a goldmine of knowledge and expertise. I myself am designing a geometric slab-serif...
    which may not turn out to be any good, but I am learning a ton in the process.
    Part of the reason I want to purchase a geometric slab is for study purposes."

    design can only be mastered by exercising it a lot together with looking a lot

  body: It is obviously advantageous to have a diverse library in itself, but making
    choices will be easier if you have a better idea of what typefaces you will need
    for your projects. So you may consider setting aside a typeface budget, so that
    when a project comes along for which you need something other than what you have
    in your current library, you can choose to buy one tailored for that project.
    You can build up your library organically that way.

    month ago and swear by it when I need a classic personality with a modern bent

    The Complete Works". In the discussion of his slab serif, Serifa, there is a wonderful
    classification of slab serifs on p. 168. It's a classification by structure and
    really gives a lot of insight into the form. If you are going to work on a slab
    serif I would definitely recommend having a look at it in a library. Interestingly,
    Frutiger regards Serifa as "one of my worst attempts at a typeface."

    I always wanted to make readable faces. And Serifa just isn't comfortable to read,
