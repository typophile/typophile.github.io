  was just wondering if theres any sort of paper and ink I should use ?\r\n\r\nAlso
  does anyone know of a good place online to send to so they could print it up for
  me ?\r\n\r\nI want it printed from a digital file if you wanted to know.\r\n\r\nNot
  sure if I used the right words as I know nothing about printing."

  body: "Hello,\r\nIf your only going for a single copy your choices are limited (unless
    you fancy wasting a lot of money). You are going to need to get it printed digitally,
    google printers in your area as it's always much better to use a local printer
    than an online one. \r\n\r\nAs for paper, you need to choose, do you want a matt
    finish to the poster or a glossy one or maybe a rough finish? The inks will be
    set by the print company you use, you can use special inks (ie spot inks) but
    for a single poster this would be expensive.\r\n\r\nOnce you have found your printer
    they will usually tell you how they want your file set up (if they don't look
    for anther printer).\r\n\r\nHere in the UK you can get a singe A1 poster digitally
    printed for around \xA39 or an A3 print for \xA36. \r\nIf you want very high quality
    you may be better going to a Photography Lab and using their printers but the
    price will increase but he quality will (hopefully) be much greater as well."

  body: "I've had good experiences with Zazzle.com. The only drawback is you don't
    get a color proof in advance, so don't use them if an exact color match is required.
    I was very pleased with the single print of a poster they did for me.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

  body: I, too, am interested in this. I need to print in color maybe twice a year
    so it's silly to try and maintain an ink-jet printer. I'd love to find a nice
    online option.

  body: "Most cities have a wide range of digital printing shops that can print posters,
    banners, etc. in single-copy. Places like Kinko's. Look in your phone book under
    Printers and under Signs. It may not be cheap, and you may have a limited range
    of papers.\r\n\r\nOn stuff like this I'd not be too interested in dealing remotely
    with e-commerce companies. I want to be able to go to the shop, so I can see a
    proof, and advice on file prep. Doing business via the web may have some advantages,
    but in this instance I'd go for face-to-face.\r\n\r\nAluminum: in good old Saint
