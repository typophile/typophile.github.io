    that will do you, since I don't think I'm ready to part with them ;-). Although
    . . . they are just sitting in my attic right now.\r\n\r\nPart of this was the
    period when each issue had a completely different guest designer. I also have
    a few of the Van Bronkhorst&#150;designed issues toward the end. I think I may
    even have the very last issue published.\r\n\r\nIs there anything you're looking
    for specifically?\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    as well as many of the issues from the 70s and 80s. They are packed away at the
    moment during our renovation, but once I unpack them I'd be happy to entertain
    offers to buy them. I'll put together a list of the issues I have and you can
    let me know if they are of interest.\r\n\r\nUnlike Kent I'm quite ready to part

    Post but no one anwser me :-( here what I\u2019 looking specifically:\r\n\r\nIn
    the presentation that Mark Simonson made about Adrian Frutiger, (more info [[http://www.marksimonson.com/article/179/frutiger-talk|here]])
    at some point he shows a picture of a old magazine/newspaper about typography
    (Upper and Lower Case I think) that shows an article from Frutiger called \u201CDesign
    and development of one basic typeface into a family of 21 different weights and
    proportions\u201D.\r\nI would love to read this article.\r\nSince I couldn\u2019t
    find it on the web I was wonder in anyone here has this article that can share.\r\n\r\nterminaldesign

    has been done with some other magazines. It's an invaluable resource for anyone
    interested in the history of type, and what was going on in the world of type
    from 1970 to 1999 (last printed issue was Fall 1999, as far I know).\r\n\r\nThe
    older issues are tabloid size, so it would be awkward and time-consuming to copy
    an entire issue, at least with the means I have at my disposal."

    being someone who has bid aggressively on items in the past, I have always been
    disappointed by the Typophile auctions and the true lack of zeal of those doing
    the bidding. Maybe it the lack of understanding as to the value of what is being
    offered, or perhaps it is an economic thing.\r\n\r\nI remember in San Francisco,
    Dave Farey found a beautiful copy of \"Big Red\" in one of the bookstores, and
    put it up for auction for what he paid for it, and it never even got an opening
    bid. I wound up paying him what he paid so he wouldn't have to lug it back home
    to the UK. Now I have two copies of \"Big Red\"!\r\n\r\nSo I guess the short answer
    to your suggestion would be, probably not."
