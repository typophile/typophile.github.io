  body: Congrats! As was asked in a comment on the linked site (and was asked by many
    about MoMA's similar moves recently), what does "acquired for their permanent
    collection" mean with regard to type designs?

  body: "Correct me if I'm wrong James, but I don't believe the Museum has actually
    <em>acquired</em> Clearview.\r\nI assume they have<em> licensed</em> it, which
    as foundries usually take great pains to emphasize, is not the same thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    if a museum is going to \"acquire\" a typeface, Clearview is prime. Props."

  body: I use acquire in the informal sense. The legal term is Accession.

  body: Okay then, now I'm curious about what "accession" means with regard to type
    designs!

  body: "Well deserved. Congratulations James. \r\n\r\nSomewhat remarkable that this
    is the first digital font Cooper-Hewitt has acquired. Hopefully this, plus the
    MOMA acquisition earlier this year, will spur more design curators to collect
    fonts.\r\n\r\n"
