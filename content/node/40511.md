  idea for this one came to me the other day, and I immediately started skeching it
  out. I've put a couple days of work into this, playing with various ideas and trying
  to get a decent first stab at the alphabet done.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to create something
  that is LOOSELY inspired by Cyrillic, although I'm not being too dogmatic about
  what exactly that means. In some cases it's very blunt and obvious, and in others
  its more subtle (or non existent). Beyond that, I'm going for mostly squarish curves
  and decorating the terminals with one-sided wedge serifs.\r\n\r\nI revel in the
  places were the glyph looks awkward, such as the lc k, uc R, and the goofy additions
  to the ascenders on uc b and d, and the rounded tail on the lc p. Ultimately, I
  want it to feel foriegn (to us Americans, that is), and slightly off-kilter.\r\n\r\nLastly,
  this is very much a display typeface for use in the context of posters and other
  abstract design projects. Legibility is a concern only to a certain extent; style
  is slightly more important in this case.\r\n\r\nI'm not taking this one too seriously,
  so feedback is welcome but I'm not looking for anything in particular. I'm happy
  with the direction as it is."

  body: "This is great.  I tend to dislike \"Cyrillic-inspired\" faces, so that's
    saying a lot, too. :)\r\n\r\nIt has exactly the effect you're going for: slightly
    disorienting with a subtle Cyrillic feel.\r\n\r\nOne tiny nitpick: the bevel where
    the h and the second curve of the m joins the rest of the letter is at a different
    angle and slightly larger than the rest of the bevels in the a,b,d,g,n,p,q,u.
    \r\n\r\nI particularly like the K. Looks like a \u0416. \r\n\r\nThe one thing
    I strongly dislike is the backwards N.  While the rest of the font has the subtle
    feel of Cyrillic foreignness, the backwards N seems like a blunt gimmick that
    screams \"It's Cyrillic, idiot!\" \r\n\r\nThe backwards N also makes it hard to
    read for people who know Cyrillic; since \u0418 is an 'i' sound, I read \"WHEN\"
    as \"WHEI\" and then have to think, oh, yeah, this is just Cyrillic-inspired,
    so that's probably an N.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the numbers. I bet they will look
    cool. :)\r\n\r\nThe uppercase needs to be kerned.  See \"AT,\" \"LY,\" \"PA,\"
    \"YO,\" \"AG,\" \"DA.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, this is great, I can totally see choosing
    this font for a project. \r\n"

  body: "Great feedback, I really appreciate it. I pretty much agree with everything
    you pointed out:\r\n\r\n1) Thanks for catching the notch on the lc h/m-- I knew
    there was going to be something inconsistent there.\r\n\r\n2) You're definitely
    right about the N. I've been debating flipping it back and I agree that it betrays
    my attempt at being relatively non-gimmicky with the rest of the face.\r\n\r\n3)
    Luckily, this cut of the font doesn't have any metrics yet.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
