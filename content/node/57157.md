  \r\nmore sepcifically, i've looked at some corporate families,\r\n\r\n- officina\r\n-
  fago\r\n- zine\r\n- unit\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nI really like these fonts, but
  with their narrow letters and loose kerning, and just can't figure out how to make
  body copy look good with them. \r\n\r\nany tips or comments?\r\n\r\nalex"
