  Install - and now Fontlab is not working. I can reinstall. That's the easy part.
  ( I think...)\r\n\r\nMy question is: \r\nIs there a way to drag the correct files
  for the AFDKO from the archive over to the new System? What about Fontlab? If I
  was able to get fontlab back up without re-installing would that mean that the Adobe
  AFDKO would be intact as well?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I ended up doing a basic re-install and the AFDKO was intact! Yay! This was
    version 5.0.2. Thumbs up to the engineers at Fontlab & Adobe!
