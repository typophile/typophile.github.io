body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI need to find a font -- preferably something from the
  Adobe OpenType Library -- that is as close as possible a substitute for H&FJ's \"Whitney\".
  \ (That is a wonderful font, but too expensive for me to purchase at the moment,
  and it's for a client's job which, naturally, they need yesterday...)\r\n\r\nI thought
  that Frutiger was pretty close, but I thought I'd pick the brains of our resident
  sages first.  :)\r\n\r\nAny help is most greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn

    \u201Cgothics\u201D such as News Gothic (1908) have long been a mainstay of editorial
    settings, and European \u201Chumanists\u201D such as Frutiger (1975) have excelled
    in signage applications, Whitney bridges this divide in a single design.\"\r\n\r\nSo
    News Gothic might not be a bad choice, either, but I think there's more Frutiger
    in Whitney than there is News Gothic. \r\n\r\nWhat about Charlotte Sans?\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/charlotte-sans\r\n\r\n\r\nThose
    are the only things I can think of that would most likely be cheaper than Whitney."

    Gothic]] from Adobe is the closest match that I can think of at the moment. Perhaps
    other folks will have better suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSB"

  body: I also read that when designing Whitney, Tobias Frere-Jones admitted that
    he tried to recreate Frutiger, but he purposely put all the calligraphic 'slants'
    in the wrong places.  So yes, Frutiger is probably a good call.

  body: Beware the oblique italics of Frutiger. A much better substitute for Whitney
    is Frutiger Next.

    that Myriad Pro is the best substitute.

    \r\nI've never been put off by Fritiger's obliques, Nor Univers, nor Helvetica's.
    Not every type requires an \"italic\"."

  body: "In Frutiger: Typefaces, The Complete Works, Frutiger says that the cursive
    forms were drawn by others, over his objection, for Frutiger Next, and he thinks
    they out of character with the typeface. In fact he writes that he was worried
    about Frutiger Next hurting his reputation. \r\n\r\nNeue Frutiger, done after
    the book was completed, is evidently his effort, with the assistance of Akira
    Kobayashi, to do it right. This corrects the adjustments in characters he had
    to make for first Linotype versions, which had a limited number of widths. Neue
    Frutiger has obliques, true to his own vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   "

  body: The Frutiger and Univers obliques were based on the Linotype metal version
    instead of the foundry version. They don't look bad, but the later versions with
    the correct italic angles and fewer compromises could be considered better if
    one wants to be picky.

  body: "James -\r\n\r\nThe obliques of Frutiger are technically inconsistent with
    the italics of Whitney, and I think it's worth noting when considering Frutiger
    as a close substitute for Whitney. No reflection on anyone's personal or professional
    taste this Ides of March."
