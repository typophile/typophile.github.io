    for that kind of work. it really doesnt matter which one you pick to get started
    (compare pricing and availability of training material). in relation to building
    up the foundations in modeling and animation, switching the environment is relatively
    easy (costs set aside).\r\n\r\n"

  body: TF22Raptor, if you're thinking of getting started in the world of 3D, begin
    with Blender. It's free, open source, and powerful.
