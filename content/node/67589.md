  body: "I met Paul in London last year, he's a master of the split-nib styles. I've
    had his writing of my name in gold ink sitting on my desk for months now, and
    still take time to examine and appreciate it often.\r\n\r\nHe's also a very fine
    singer, and likes to sing period-appropriate music depending on what script he
    is writing."
