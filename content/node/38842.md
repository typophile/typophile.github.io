body: " I just posted a beta of a serif face I've been working on lately at [[http://betatype.com/node/35]].\r\n\r\nI
  wouldn't recommend using them for big projects, as they are definitely beta quality
  at this point. However, the design ideas are there, and in the hands of a skilled
  typographer could produce some interesting results, as the family is pretty complete.\r\n\r\nI'm
  mostly interested in hearing any feedback/feature requests anyone might have.\r\n\r\nNote:
  These beta cuts probably won't be up for long, as I take them down before the official
  release."
