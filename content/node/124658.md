  body: "This graphic looks to use the same typeface as [[http://lincroyable-magazine.com|L'Incroyable
    Magazine]] which Rapha\xEBl Garnier did the art direction. Following this track,
    found the magazine [[http://22ruemuller.com/img/lincroyablemagazine/lincroyable_dossier_dePresse.pdf|press
    kit]] via editor '22 Rue Mueller' and PDF reveals the name of the typeface, 'IncBruggen'.
    Did a quick search using this name but it turned up of nothing. Probably a bespoke
    typeface by Rapha\xEBl Garnier and also used for the magazine."
