    it looks somewhere between the Roman and the Bold, but I can't find a semibold,
    so I dunno."

  body: Garamond book did'nt quite match the P's have a unique shape.. look towards
    the bottom where they come back into itself. And the top of the D is very unique
    also..

  body: I think Mark is right. I didn't think of the ITC version because I hate ITC
    fonts so much.
