  body: "thank you kthomps5\r\n\r\nthank you ryuk, yes it is the same one with the
    http://typophile.com/node/114140.\r\nI think the \"G\" customized from Seaside,
    and the other words use Vanitas Stencil. what do you think?"

  body: Can't state if it has been started with Vanitas but still thinking it is the
    best out-the-box option, squooshing it a bit, adjusting stencil and recreating
    /G from /O. I'd be very surprised if finally somebody come and confirm both New
    York Magazine and Selena Gomez artwork cover are using the same typeface. Maybe
    designer of SG's album cover took inspiration from New York Magazine.
