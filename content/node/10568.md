body: can anyone help me? <BR> <BR>i am currently trying to research the field of
  dyslexia and the <BR>typefaces available for dyslexic people. i was wondering if
  anyone <BR>would know where i would be able to obtain any information on what <BR>would
  be required to make the face more legible for a dyslexic <BR>person... what the
  lengths of the ascenders and descenders should be, <BR>for example, and how symetry
  effects the way the typrface is read. <BR> <BR>many thanks, <BR> <BR>leigh middleton.

    have some research, but i want to know more about the specifics.

    body: Gerrit Noordzij held a lecture on this specific subject. A transcript of
      his lecture was published under the title "Das kleine Kind und die Schrift"
      <a href="http://www.typedu.org/read/english.html#theory" target="_blank">(check
      the PDF).</a> Unfortunately this book is out of print and in German language
      only.

  body: "Hey, just finished a thesis on this....\r\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of information
    floating around on the internet, but what most people that try to approach this
    subject don't realize is that dyslexia is really just a blanket term for a wide
    variety of reading / writing disabilities. To really approach the problem, I would
    recommend narrowing your initial investigation to a limited number of manifestations
    of dyslexia (ie: letter-reversal, scotopic sensitivity, etc.). \"Read Regular\"
    for example really only addresses the issue of letter-reversal. And while there
    is little info available for the kinds of things you are looking for (x-height
    ratio, etc), I have found that the best method is still one-on-one testing with
    dyslexic individuals (in my case school children). I'm sorry that my thesis is
    not online yet, it should be once I solidify a distributor / publisher.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps. Let me know if you have any more questions!"

  body: "Hi Leigh,\r\n\r\nI took a pragmatic approach when designing the freebie Lexia
    Readable (www.k-type.com) - common wisdom in UK education regarded Comic Sans
    to be the choice of font by/for people with dyslexia. I decided to base Lexia
    Readable on the shapes and spacing in Comic Sans, to try to retain its accessibility
    and friendliness, but to add a more contemporary, adult feel and lose the comic
    kiddiness so that adolescent and adult dyslexics might not feel patronized. I
    used the internet to research the preferred x height, the advised non-symmetry
    of characters, and the use of the simpler, handwritten forms of a and g for instance.
    However, after talking to and exchanging emails with dyslexic people, professionals
    and university lecturers I too began to doubt whether a single font could ever
    be one full and worthy response to the wide variety of conditions covered by the
    umbrella term dyslexia.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the journey!\r\n\r\nKeith Bates, K-Type"

    body: "Hi Keith,\r\n\r\nthanks for the advice. i have also since realised that
      one typeface is not going to solve all of the problems a person with Dyslexia
      would face. However, it is still my belief that there is a need for more legible
      typefaces that are well designed, that we can all use to set type in, but that
      are also specifically for Dyslexics. It is, unfortunately, a shame that i have
      been unable to continue with this project, as my tutor at Bucks decided two
      weeks ago that it was not an appropriate project for the course. A little frustrating
      as i am a huge type enthusiast and a typographer by trade. Plus i have two or
      three sketch books of research. But, it is undoubtedly something i wish to continue
      with after my studies. Maybe i will apply to the design council for funding
      to research the project further? Who knows, but i have included a lot about
      Lexia in my research, and it is a very interesting face.\r\n\r\nThank you again,\r\n\r\nLeigh

  body: "I also fooled around with this for my Thesis project as well. What I found
    was that making certain characters different from each other in relation to shape
    (b, d, p, q, I, l, 1 for example) can help those with learning disabilities. Take
    a look at Spiekermann's ITC Officina and FF Info Display, as well as Clearview
    Highway, Parisine, Neuzeit, and even Thesis for some examples of this kind of
    idea. When I made my typeface for my Thesis project I made sure that all of the
    previously mentioned letterforms all had different shapes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would
    study Cyrillic alphabets as well, I believe they might offer some potential ideas."
