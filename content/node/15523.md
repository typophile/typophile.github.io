  body: "Hello Maroy,\r\n\r\nfor me it`s like http://typophile.com/node/15526 perfect
    too. It`s well balanced and the space betwenn \"M\" and \"a\" is right to hold
    in tension.\r\nFor purpose... i would guess it for fashion or singer? :o)"

  body: "Not to sound too harsh, but, to me, it looks kinda 'sloppy'.. Not 'bad',
    but it looks like what it is.: Soft, but slightly sloppy, casual handwriting..
    <em>( Especially the second 'a', in 'Makara'.. )</em> Maybe try to clean it up
    some more and refine it..\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\" target=\"_blank\">formlos</a>"

  body: Dav is right, at least make all the a's agree. For $9 you can get anyones
    handwriting digitalized. Good start now more work

  body: "The problem with digitizing handwriting is that it almost always has the
    appearance that Streamline gives, antiseptic and 'cleaned-up' which is precisely
    what you don't need, plus the lack of difference between characters \u2013 no-one
    writes exactly the same character twice. \r\nThere are some areas where that feel
    is reproduced in your logo; the counter of the first a where the loop doesn't
    quite lead to the k and the ar ligature has an awkward kink just before the loop
    of the r. The overall appearance is good but there is room for improvement, I
    think you should look at making the second a wider (possibly wider than the other
    two to compensate for the complex joining structures).\r\nTim"
