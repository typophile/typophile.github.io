  Daft Punk in their One More Time single cover. The font is called \"WatchMNOutline_,\"
  but all the version I have found don't have lowercase letters. If anyone can make
  the uppercase letters the lowercase ones as well,  it would be perfect. Also, here
  are some covers for reference-\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OneMoreTime_4000.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Daft+Punk+-+One+More+Time+-+One+More+Virgin+-+DOUBLE+CD-203300_6470.jpg]"

    in question is a seven-line sentence fragment. I imagine it would still hold up
