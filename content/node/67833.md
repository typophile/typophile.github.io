body: "Hey there!\r\nI'm looking for any information about Tal Leming, House Industries,
  and specifically the United type family. I've contacted both Tal and House, and
  am waiting for replies. I've also combed through both of their websites, attended
  a lecture by House, and have dug around the internet a bit. However, there aren't
  a ton of people who have written on Tal or House in the past, so finding a lot of
  information hasn't been that easy.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a final project for my
  typography class and we are to choose a type face and its designer, present a presentation
  and essay on the two, create a poster advertising the presentation, and a catalog
  pamphlet with information about the two. I've selected United which of course means
  T. Leming and House Industries.\r\n\r\nCan anyone maybe help me out since you are
  all type gurus? Anyone know where I can find more information about United, T. Leming's
  work and his fight for using type on the web, etc.?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nAlexander"

    has a history. (Not that the history he does have isn't full of great work.) \r\n\r\nI'm
    not trying to put a damper on your project, but if you'd chosen someone such as
    Matthew Carter or Ed Benguiat, well they have history. "

  body: Have you looked at the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/House-Industries/dp/393112620X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1267157428&sr=8-1>House
    Industries book</a>? I haven't myself, but I'd guess there might be some information
    there.

  body: "Sure I could have picked an older typographer but I don't work on projects
    looking for the easy way out, I work on projects that I think will challenge me
    and teach me what I need to know to keep up with the world. T. Leming is on the
    forefront of pushing typography into the web-age which I find exciting. However,
    that's no offense intended to Matthew Carter or Ed Benguiat, they are both amazing
    typographers as well, much better than Leming of course. \r\n\r\nI'd love to look
    at the House Industries book, but like amazon shows its $150 because its out of
    print. Unfortunately I don't know anyone around here who owns a copy of it either."

    they''re a significant aspect of his work.'
