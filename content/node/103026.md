body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm a design student from Muenster (Germany) and our
  project in this semester is to create a corporate design for a typographic walk
  through an area of the city. Our first task was to collect interesting typographical
  objects and now we want to define what Font's were used in our collection of examples.
  We've already borrowed a couple of books which contain a lot of old typefaces, but
  it's really hard to define them or just to find similar examples, so maybe you can
  help me/us ! \r\n\r\nthank you in advance!"

    target='_blank'>Time Script</a> renamed. I'll never understand why MyFonts allows
    Softmaker to sell their fonts there at all - much less clones at prices that undercut
    the legit versions.\r\n\r\nMaybe they have some legitimate arrangement to do this
    - but it sure seems unlikely to me."
