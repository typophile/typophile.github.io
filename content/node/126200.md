body: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to discover the name of the typeface used on a
  1974 client's brand.\r\nJust curiosity and historical purposes.\r\n\r\nThe glyph
  is used as an ampersand, but I guess the people who made the logo flipped the \"3\"
  to make it appear an \"E\".\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
