body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-watchbatteries2_6696.JPG]This eccentric
  sign is in West Seattle's Alaska Junction. I'm strangely fascinated. What is your
  take, lettering experts? \r\n\r\n1. The ornate gold & red headine: Is \"Watch Batteries\"
  the name of the shop? Seems odd!\r\n\r\nWatch batteries, sinuous organic script,
  and climbing roses are things that usually would not go together, right? \r\n\r\nIs
  the owner saying: \"I do mechanical work for a living, but at heart I'm a sentimental
  old-fashioned lover of beauty and art\"?\r\n\r\n2. The second headline -\"Fast Quality
  Repairs\" - is in a completely different, equally ornate Art Nouveau style in small-caps
  lettering embellished with a wing and swashes, but the letters are oddly spaced
  and placed.\r\n\r\n3. The phone number doesn't match the other lettering in color
  or style. A thick blue outline doesn't enhance legibility, because of the low contrast
  with the green background.\r\n\r\n4. The (misspelled) phrase \"Whole Sale Prices,\"
  is squeezed right underneath the second phrase and overlaps the phone number, as
  if it was an afterthought. The snaky script does not match the headline style exactly
  (look at the W). \r\n\r\nThen there's the huge flower, and the pocket watch perched
  on top of the headline script, containing a giant diamond. The whole thing is set
  in a rusty metal holder mended with duct tape. \r\n\r\nIs this a relic of the 60s?
  Was the sign painter stoned or tripping when he created this art? Or does it go
  back even further? Someday I'll ask the owner"

  body: "Folk art (and its eccentric sibling, visionary art) appeals to us because
    it displays imagination and manual dexterity in their raw state, unrefined by
    formal rules of composition or fitness for a practical purpose. Who's to say that
    art nouveau flowers don't go with watch batteries? Who cares if <em>Watch Batteries</em>
    is the name if the shop? It's really the only piece of information their customers
    need to know. Who cares if you can read the phone number? This looks like a place
    that gets more walk-ins than phone orders anyway.\r\n<em>Watch Batteries</em>
    and the phone number are almost certainly the work of the same hand (maybe the
    lettering artist for [[http://www.bluebeat.com/albums/13513|this album]] ended
    up fixing watches in Seattle). The white lettering was done by a different, less
    skilled hand, probably at a later time (perhaps painted over something else that
    previously filled that space).\r\n"

  body: The phone number is for Western Jewelry and Coin Exchange, which goes a little
    beyond watch batteries but explains the diamond-in-the-pocketwatch logo. They
    have a web site at www.westseattlejewelers.com/coins/coins.htm.

  body: This kind of thing always throws me into semantic dissonance, and I'm like,
    why should I watch these batteries? And what's so hard and fast about the quality
    of the repairs? And what would be a part sale price?

  body: "I got more: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-jewelrepair_6033.jpg]\r\nCompare
    the first watch batteries sign to this one - same business. At first glance, no
    frills...squeezing as many letters as possible, overlapping for maximum impact.
    But then I noticed the arched \"jewelry\" and the capital I with dainty dot added.
    It's distinctive. Is this folk art also?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-freshfish_5698.jpg]\r\nThis
    is in the multinational immigrant 'hood. They sell \r\n\"a Lot of sea food,\"
    I see. \"Freshfish\" is one word......why U.S. catfish? Is foreign catfish suspect
    to their American customers? \"Free cut and clean\" sounds like a classified ad
    in a gay alternative rag. The sign DOES have a sense of neatness, style and proportion...yet
    looks like it's speaking with an accent. What would you call this style of lettering?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-maharaja_5040.jpg]\r\nThis
    restaurant is one of my favorites - but the sign hurts to look at it. The background
    illustration might've been peeled off a webpage. The word \"Maharajah\" is almost
    illegible. \"Cuisine of India\" has an outline so thick, the original font is
    almost submerged. The other text - what is that, Tiffany Heavy? Comments?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-adultstore_5256.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-taxservice_6668.jpg]\r\nThe
    Adult Superstore adds a touch of class with the Peignot style of font. (\"Stan\"
    the adult superstore guy added a nativity scene to their window at Christmas.)
    The tax guy was thinking along the same lines. \r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\nI
    think Khmer lettering honestly does add beauty to the cheesiest surroundings.
    See below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-unitedkhmer_5493.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-angkormrkt_3717.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

    or one of the Retinal Circus artists, dropped down from Vancouver. John Moehring
    worked in Seattle as the artist for the Eagles Temple auditorium. Or this could
    be evidence that Rick Griffin, Stanley Mouse, Alton Kelly, Wes Wilson, or Victor
    Moscoso had a lost weekend in Seattle.\r\n\r\n>maybe the lettering artist for

    One Bite."
