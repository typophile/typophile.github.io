    is like suggesting a truck to someone who asked for a racing car ...\r\nA shame
    that Today's character set has not been extended yet.\r\n"

    Cronos</a> should work, and Adobe's EULA permits adding glyphs, so even if it

  body: Agenda and Bliss are nice alternatives to Gill Sans, but none of these is
    that similar to Today Sans, IMO.
