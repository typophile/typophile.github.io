body: "A client of mine uses one of my typefaces in text work under Windows 7, in
  Regular and Bold.\r\n\r\nHe complained about being not able to actually spot the
  difference between the two fonts on screen, when working with a usual display scaling
  of his document (Word, I suppose).\r\n\r\nAlright, the Bold is actually a modestly
  weighted Semibold. So far so good, it works on other Win versions appearently well,
  and on the Mac of course. I never heard that issue reported before.\r\n\r\nWhat
  is it? What could be possibly done?\r\nThanks for your thoughts in advance."

  body: This issue is old, it's a standard challenge for all Windows Cleartype. Verdana
    and Georgia are examples of the solution, bolder, and wider than usual bold. See
    also the RE fonts at webtype.com. Windows bold fonts that do not work so well
    include Trebuchet and the CT collection whose bolds are made for print or something.
