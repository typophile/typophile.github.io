  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">They were derived from Roman inscriptions but were informal to be used in everyday written forms like notes etc unlike proper documents for Emperors documents etc but does that mean that they did not have serifs on them or did they? i have seen an example of them but don&rsquo;t know if the ticks at ends of letters count as serifs because they seem slightly different as they are handwritting-like. Can someon eplease clarify the above for me. I would also like to know Rustic forms, Roman uncials, insular uncials are serif based lettering too or do they not count as they are not too relevant in the copy i have. please explain.
PS if the humanist bookhand evolved in italy in 15th century was based on Carolingian inscriptions they surely the above would be serifs.Am i irght in saying this although the above don&rsquo;t seem like proper serifs. Are they known to be serifs?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Carolingian is a clear and manageable script that was &ldquo;established&rdquo; by the educational reforms of Charlemagne in the latter part of the 8th and early 9th centuries. As rediscovered and refined in the Italian Renaissance by the humanists, the script survives as the basis of the present-day <a href="http://www.ejf.org.uk/Resources/JRNarticle.pdf">Roman</a> alphabet.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.typophile.com/wiki/Carolingian_Minuscule">Carolingian minuscule</a>, was then a highly legible script which the Humanists called “littera antiqua”, “the ancient letter”, wrongly believing that it was the script used by the ancient Rome Romans (it was invented in the reign of Charlemagne, though only used significantly after that era).</p>
<p>Carolingian minuscule was the direct and linear ancestor of <a href="http://typophile.com/node/20252">blackletter</a>, too.</p>
<p>Carolingian, although legible, was time-consuming and labour-intensive to produce. It was large and wide and took up a lot of space on a  manuscript. As early as the 11th century, different forms of Carolingian were already being used, and by the mid-12th century, a clearly distinguishable form, able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new <a href="http://typophile.com/node/29875?from=2&comments_per_page=1">books</a>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miss Gigg et al,</p>
<p>I have been twice now to St. Gallen in northeast Switzerland (less than an hour by train from Zurich) to visit the Stiftbibliotek. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know it, this is an absolutely amazing library that served as one of the real repositories for the written word when everything went dark. For anyone interested in calligraphy, and in this hand in particular, it&rsquo;s a marvelous stop.</p>
<p>The two outstanding things for me are their manuscript collection &ndash; much of it on display &ndash; and the brand-new manuscript they have commissioned. I spent a lot of time looking at pages written by Alcuin (The Very Man Himself!) from around 800, they are right there in the display cases to be seen from inches away. He was not just a good teacher, but a most accomplished scribe in his own right.</p>
<p>And in a private space (note the temerity with which i begin a sentence with a conjunction . . .) which can be reached by prior request, they have a modern manuscript called something like &ldquo;The Testament of the Trees.&rdquo; (I hope someone Swiss can jump in here and correct what are bound to be some inaccuracies &ndash; I speak of this from the vantage point of great admiration and passion more than from solid knowledge.) The book was commissioned by the library and was written out skin by skin by the best scribes of today in that part of the world, on vellum, using ground pigments and home-made inks, in German, French, Italian and Romansch languages. The texts all have to do with trees and the fragile environment of the earth.</p>
<p>What is so disarming about the book, though, is that it is written in hands that feel medieval, and using colors that feel medieval to make initial caps and pictures, but the pictures show subjects such as a bicyclist cresting the top of a hill with a large motorcar just behind, or an image of the space shuttle hurtling into the void. Quite marvelous to have the medieval kit of raw materials and styles, but with unabashedly modern content. Important and meaningful texts, too.</p>
<p>Visitors are encouraged to make copies of this book, but not in the way you might think: It is verboten to take pictures of it, and there are <em>no</em> postcards of it for sale, but you may come in with paper and pencil or pen, and copy out the pages by hand, just as they did 1200 years ago!</p>
<p>I cannot recommend enough a visit to this place if you have not yet been there.  <a href="http://www.stiftsbibliothek.ch">http://www.stiftsbibliothek.ch</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>missgiggles, stop thinking of writing as having serifs. Think of writing  as a practice in which a writer leads into a downstroke with a little upstroke and ends or leads out of his or her stroke with a little upstroke. This is not how most of us learned to write, but it is how writing was practiced in medieval times. By the end of the middle ages a more complicated pattern or leading into and leaving downstrokes had emerged in some formal scripts. The serif is the residue of the &lsquo;formaliztion&rsquo; of these elements <em>in a new technology of disseminating texts</em>. The new technology involves punch-cutting, which is a sculpting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formalization' means: giving a standardized form to.</p>

<p>Correct, but in the writing books of the 14th an 15th century and elsewhere (though I haven&rsquo;t checked them all), they were not referred to as serifs. In the terminology of the 15th century writing consists of the horizontal head-stroke  [<em>testa</em>], the curved down-stroke or body-strke [<em>corpo</em>], the narrow diagonal [<em>virgula</em>], and the vertical down-stroke [<em>asta</em>]. The closest this comes to &lsquo;serif&rsquo; is the &lsquo;horizontal head-stroke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The designation <em>serif</em> is a product of the typographical era. <img src="/images/old-images/" alt=""></p>

<p>Idly surfing through wikipedia and others it appears that serif (the word) first appeared in English (from Dutch) in either 1830 or 1841 (there is some confusion between sites on this, none of them appear authorative, although the reference is taken from OED, so if someone has access to this perhaps they could check) as a back formation of sans-serif.</p>

<p>Gerrit Noordzij offers some &ldquo;linguistic speculations&rdquo; in <em>Letterletter</em> (page 94f). Essentially they depend on the a common ancestry of the English <em>scrape</em>, <em>score</em> and <em>scratch</em>; the Dutch <em>schreef</em> and <em>schrijven</em>; the German <em>Schraffe</em> and <em>schreiben</em>; and the Latin <em>scribere</em> in the Greek stem <strong>skarifa</strong>.</p>
<p>In Dutch <em>schreef</em> is the past tense of <em>schrijven</em> (to write) and &ldquo;…the scratch made by carpenters and metlworkers as a guide for cutting. In punch cutting a schreef is first of all the initial scratch on the blank punch marking the terminal of the stroke of a letter. […] In punch cutting the meaning of the word was extended to the terminal itself and finally restricted again to the protruding parts of the terminal […] so that a letter with cold terminals […] is now referred to as a letter without <em>schreven</em> […]&rdquo;</p>
<p>My own homegrown &ldquo;imaginition of origins&rdquo; relies on the observation that <em>serif</em> is a back formation fron <em>sans serif</em> and on the double meaning of <em>schreef</em>.</p>
<p>It is possible that when the &lsquo;grotesques&rsquo; emerged they were considered as not having a scriptorial precedent, hence: <em>scrijf-loos</em> (literally: &lsquo;writing-less&rsquo;). Because of &lsquo;semantic drift,&rsquo; multiple-referents, cross-language pronounciational slippage, and the fact that a salient feature of these &lsquo;writing-less&quot; forms was the abscence of an elaborated head-stroke at the scratch or <em>schreef</em> marking the termination of the stroke of the letter, <em>scrijf-loos</em> could have become confounded with &ldquo;without <em>schreef</em> in the sense of sans (elaborated) <em>scratch</em> or <em>skarifa</em>.</p>
<p>But who really knows?</p>
