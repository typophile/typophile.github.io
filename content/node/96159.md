    for maths, but then the user would be working with a specialized math font.\r\n\r\nDo
    typographers actually set arrows in the same text box as running text?\r\n\r\nDave,
    what are the most common uses of typographic arrows, that you are catering to
    by providing them in your font?\r\n\r\nAs far as style goes, the vast majority
    of fonts could combine with two or three arrow styles, that are available as \u201Csorts\u201D
    in a pi-font. That font is the Symbols font, which is bundled with the Mac OS.
    That\u2019s where I, as a typographer, would go to locate an arrow \u2014 it\u2019s
    a small font, so the arrows are relatively easy to \uFB01nd in the glyph palette.\r\n\r\nLeft-
    and right-facing manicules are more likely to be used in text layouts."

    I am not so sure a standard text font should have this in the ligature feature.
    It might be better placed in a stylistic set for users who have read the instructions
    and know how to use it. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind using English terms. If you use
    a Latin font in \u201Cregular\u201D and \u201Cbold\u201D you probably also understand
    \u201Cleft\u201D or \u201Cwest\u201D. Things like {^|v} are a bit cryptic. \r\n\r\nI

    reason for not using cardinal directions like east and west is that there are

    loosely based on the naming conventions in Unicode. "

    of tables (share index 'TYPE \u21911.7%' - that kind of thing) and in these situations
    the arrows having the same width as tabular figures would be useful. Getting arrows
    from a different font seems to me like it would be more hassle than finding the
    arrows in the glyph palette for the same font. Arrows do seem to me to be far
    more useful than a lot of the other glyphs we have to make. Has anyone here even
    seen a perthousand used anywhere? Nick, If people use a specialised maths font
    for maths (which I expect they do) it doesn't follow that you include things like
    partial differential in your fonts, but you do. I think it's interesting that
    you would consider arrows an embellishment but not these other things, or are
    you just working to an encoding standard (Adobe?) that forces you to include them?\r\n\r\nRalf,
    I have been convinced not to use any kind of substitutions for arrows, mainly
    because changing the font to a different one doesn't keep the arrow, but reverts
    to #left for example. I have decided the best way to deal with them is to put
    them in an ornaments feature, so they can be found easily in the glyph palette."

    books, annual reports or whatever. Using arrows that match the typeface will usually
    be a better choice than just throwing system font symbols in the mix. \r\nBut
    maybe that's also a chicken or the egg dilemma. If more regular text fonts had
    such arrows, people would expect these symbols more often and look for it. And
    offering easy input methods also helps. Glyph palettes are for finding special
    characters occasionally. If special characters are used frequently, they need
    to be typed. "
