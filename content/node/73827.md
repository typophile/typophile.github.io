    is yes. Otherwise, no. This typeface adds absolutely nothing to the existing typefaces.
    If you do want to continue this is has to become absolutely perfect for it to
    add something to the market, which it is not at moment. Just a few notes:\r\nW
    is unbalanced and to small.\r\nZ is to wide.\r\nThe contrast in width between
    round letters like the O and 'normal' letters like the V, T, N, etc is to large."

  body: "Many thanks for your critique\r\n\r\nYou are both right, this typeface in
    not meant to be something completely new. However, if I will ever publish this
    font it will be quite certain open source. And at this time I think there is no
    comparable free font coming in different optical sizes. So I surely want to learn
    from this project, but I could also imagine that this font will be used (probably
    not by professionals). The optical size 24pt can already be used for titles (same
    purpose as Trajan), I guess.\r\n\r\nI agree, that the W is too narrow and I will
    change that, but unbalanced? Compare it to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/albertina-mt/regular/|Albertina]],
    I think many fonts have unbalanced W's. (Or am I getting something wrong?)\r\n\r\nThe
    widths of the letters are actually quite similar to Minion Pro an if you look
    at some Garamond fonts (like Garamond No. 8) you will find an even larger contrast
    in widths between round letters and 'normal' letters.\r\n\r\nI will certainly
    work further on but I think that lowercase letters will not come before christmas.\r\n\r\nAnd
    thank you clauses for your appreciation of METAFONT. In opposition to this [[http://typophile.com/node/13885|article]]
    this font shows that it is possible to generate type1 fonts using the METAFONT
    language (thanks to mf2pt1)."

    AFAIK no one made a real parametrised font with METAFONT except Knuth himself

    I think it is very interesting experience, and even if you don't think any body

    a very welcomed addition).\r\n\r\nFor going from MATAFONT to PostScript there
    is, besides mf2pt1, METATYPE1 which GUST people developed for their fonts, though,
    IIRC, they use a certain subset of MATAFONT. I'd even an experiment to use directly
    MetaPost and FontForge to convert Knuth's Punk font to OpenType (but the funny
    nature of that font makes it a bit special, also the original sources were \"metapostified\"
    prior to my work)."

  body: "1996typo could not be more wrong.  I like comparing fonts and the closer
    to TNR the better.  What is more, the big thing with fonts is the vibe they give
    the whole written page, not the characteristic of the letters.  I love Futura.
    \ I'm pretty sure I can remember seeing it in a Ladybird book from my childhood.
    \ The O is much wider than the L with its dumb little horisontal, but the the
    whole font seems so fresh, open and optimistic and without pretense. Those letters
    give me a good vibe.  So there.  \r\n\r\nAnd another thing, I recon it is better
    if there is variation between different letters.  If they are too in-proportion
    they look too much the same and readability suffers.  I like Exocet, and it has
    been prominently used.  The letters in Exocet look very different and don't all
    follow the same rules.  "

  body: "<cite>AFAIK no one made a real parametrised font with METAFONT except Knuth
    himself (May be the recent GUST fonts are, but they don't provide METAFONT sources)</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    think there are quite some  fonts written in METAFONT which are not by Knuth (look
    at this [[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/fonts-faq/metafont-list/|list]]). However,
    many of them belong to the following 3 classes \r\n<ul>\r\n<li> only related to
    TeX (maths fonts or extensions/improvements to Computer Modern)\r\n<li> not released
    in any proper outline form\r\n<li> not OpenSource (e.g. fonts from the old Metafoundry)\r\n</ul>\r\nAt
    the first glance I was stunned by the GUST project and the related METATYPE1.
    I still think they are doing great work but I had to discover that GUST writes
    the already existing font outlines to a pseudo-abstract form in METATYPE1 language
    (instead of a proper reenginering by coding means). In addition, METATYPE1 is
    not very powerful in comparison to METAFONT, and it seems that the language is
    still under changements. METATYPE1 could produce parametrised fonts, but afaik
    there is no such font published yet. Even the LatinModern faces make use of the
    1990's outlines of Computer Modern instead of the existing METAFONT sources.\r\n\r\nmf2pt1
    has also some restrictions (but not as severe ones as METATYPE1 has), in particular
    it has problems with unfilling and drawing commands (Computer Modern mainly \"defines
    the outlines\" and then draws along them with a pen).\r\n\r\n<cite>Well, I know
    of other people who are also pursuing the METAFONT approach in order to make better
    smarter fonts for computer screens</cite> \r\n\r\nI must admit that I have not
    cared about pixels/bitmaps for the Nilus typeface.\r\n\r\n<cite>By the way, does
    a graphical editor exist for METAFONT or is it all done in code?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    do not know any graphical editor for METAFONT but I also think that this is impossible
    in general. Personally, I coded the letters and ran METAFONT and gftodvi thousands
    of time to see how the letters are developping.\r\n\r\n<cite>Do you have the source
    posted somewhere? I'd really like to see which parameters have manual values,
    and which are computed from others.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe sources are not published
    yet and unfortunately there are still a lot of errors in them. \"Manual\" values
    are only\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> slant (italicness, regular has slant=0 and italic has
    slant=.25)\r\n<li> boldness (regular has boldness=0, bold has boldness 1, light
    would have boldness -1)\r\n<li> size (optical size)\r\n</ul>\r\nAll the rest of
    the parameters are computed of these with some very easy functions (mainly affine
    dependencies).\r\n\r\n<cite>I'm a lover of all three TeX, open source, and good
    old-style text faces</cite> \r\n\r\nMe too!!!\r\n\r\n<cite>Then again, I'm kinda
    glad XeTeX/fontspec have allowed us to say goodbye to METAFONT</cite> \r\n\r\nSo
    am I. The pdf I attached is done with XeTeX. In fact I am too lazy to do experiments
    with the local texmf tree.\r\n\r\n<cite>Can you tell me a bit more about what
    made you use that system?</cite> \r\n\r\nI love TeX and I find Computer Modern
    a very good typeface for formulas (but that is probably just because I seldom
    see something else), but I do not like it for texts. So I often combined \"good
    old-style text faces\" such as URW Garamond No.8 as text typeface with Computer
    Modern for formulas. Of course, such combinations cannot fit exactly. But I try
    with Nilus to compose a font that matches well with Computer Modern, which means
    that capital letter height and x-height are the same. The ascender height of lowercase
    letters (such as l) is a bit higher than in Computer Modern in order to set the
    sloped serif to the same height (because Nilus uses a larger serif drop as Computer
    Modern).\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>What are your plans for the typeface?</cite> \r\n\r\nI
    plan to fill the TeX 8bit encoding scheme (Cork encoding) which is similar to
    the Adobe Standard encoding.\r\n\r\n<cite>Have you used outline editors before,
    and if yes, what is using MF like?</cite> \r\n\r\nI have been using fontforge
    for quite a while and it is a great editor, but there are things that a fonteditor
    never can do (e.g. optical sizes in a sensible way). Using MF is lots of fun for
    me now and lots of frustration at the very beginning (just like TeX). As I am
    used to mathematics and programming many things were easy to see for me but could
    be hard for people who find maths desgusting.\r\n\r\n<cite>Have you considered
    joining other efforts or using existent free typefaces as a basis for your work?</cite>
    \r\n\r\nI have copied some code from cmbase.mf by Donald Knuth but I have not
    made use of any existing outline fonts in means of copying traces.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for all your answers. This encourages me a lot and I have already begun working
    on lowercase."

  body: "@Sebastian: The U is now a tiny bit narrower, thank you for your advice\r\n\r\nI
    deleted the documentation in the starter of this thread as it is out of date.
    I will instead publish now and then a new version of nlr10.pdf (in the starter)
    which contains all current glyphs and makes easy visible how the glyphs are constructed.
    In some time there will also be a new documentation\r\n\r\nDue to some stagnancy
    in lowercase (\"e\" is incredible awful to parametrize with all metaness in mind)
    and some progress in uppercase (optical correction for diagonal stems with hair
    width, adjusted serifs for N and U, new ideas about senseful kerning, etc) I decided
    to interrupt work on lowercase and to improve and complete the uppercase letters.\r\n\r\nSo
    here is the rough plan for the font Nilus\r\n- improvement and completion (\xC6,\xD8,\xDE
    etc.) of uppercase letters\r\n- punctation\r\n- make Nilus TDS-compliant (for
    TeX-users)\r\n- publication of experimental font (uppercase only) under restricted
    license\r\n- roman lowercase\r\n- roman numbers\r\n- italic lowercase\r\n- italic
    numbers\r\n- special glyphs\r\n- complete kerning\r\n- addition of semibold(fast
    & easy),condensed(probably fast & easy),smallcaps(easy but annoying)\r\n- publication
    of font \r\n\r\nAbout publication of experimental font: Does anybody know a license
    of the form \"use it freely at your own risk, do not modify, sell or republish\"?\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I said that I have been working on uppercase and optical sizes, I will
    prove this here with the following image :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exa2_3809.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    oh, Nilus is capable of generating font (smoothly) at any optical size (for example
    12.24684167 pt) but I recognized (just as many before me as it seems) that there
    is no need for more than the following point sizes:\r\n\r\n72pt (absent in TeX,
    \"Display\" in Adobish, for large titles)\r\n17pt (present in TeX, \"Subhead\"
    in Adobish, for normal headers)\r\n10pt (present in TeX, \"Regular\" in Adobish,
    for normal text and standard math)\r\n8pt (present in TeX, \"Caption\" in Adobish,
    for footnotes and sub/superscript math)\r\n5pt (present in TeX, absent in Adobish,

    I would recommend to learn METAFONT in the following way:\r\n\r\n- do NOT look

    read [[http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDAQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetafont.tutorial.free.fr%2Fdownloads%2Fmftut.pdf&rct=j&q=mftut&ei=KybETdbtMcf2sgb7j9HEDw&usg=AFQjCNHM0elUNcYVKPlI51BhKXr4I36_lQ&cad=rja|the
    metafont tutorial]]\r\n- read the METAFONTbook, at least the first chapters. You
    will find it in libraries, there are also some (probably illegal?) copies of it
    in the internet as pdf, but with no pictures (knuth opened the source of the book
    but didn't make it free)\r\n- forget about pens (and the following commands: bot
    top lft rt)\r\n- concentrate on filling, unfilling and penstroke (and the following
    suffices: r l)\r\n- forget about pixelproblems\r\n- define some macros (functions)\r\n-
    Still: do NOT look at the sources of Computer Modern! you may look at mflogo (but
    be aware, it works with pens, but it is a good example for a minimal font)\r\n-
    When you look at the sources of Computer Modern (for serifs, diagonal stems etc),
    look also at the metafont output too see where the defined points are\r\n\r\nI
    am a mathematician but one can also work with METAFONT with little mathematical
    knowledge. Basic vector priniciple understandings and basic equation ideas are
    recommended though."

    \ To create his fonts, Knuth created a tool that enabled\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> a (relatively)
    simple way of specifying a curve (this includes interpolation and ensuring (almost)
    continuous curvature at segment boundaries), and\r\n<li> the ability to generate
    glyphs programmatically.  This allowed the designer to implement specified relationships
    between shapes based on a set of parameters.\r\n</ol>\r\nKnuth chose to use Metafont
    to create fonts by expanding strokes.  However, Metafont (and descendants Metapost
    and Metatype1) can also be used to programmatically build outlines of glyphs based
    on parameters.  fujito's creation of Nilus is an excellent demonstration of the
    power of this approach and these tools.  In fact, Knuth's approach can also be
    realized without explicitly using Meta*; [[http://typophile.com/node/64835]] shows
    some preliminary work I did programmatically creating a glyph using only Fontforge's
    Python interface.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty I see with Knuth's approach is something
    that he also struggled with: how much to parameterize?  If every quantity is specified
    separately, then you've lost most of the power of specifying glyphs programmatically.
    \ However, too few parameters, and the glyphs look too \"cookie-cutter\".  It's
    not clear to me that the typographic community has a clear and articulated (mathematical)
    understanding of the relationships between different features in a well-designed
    font.  I don't see any reason, though, why such an understanding could not be
    possible.\r\n\r\nBest wishes, Stephen"

    typesetting\" as the following citation shows:\r\n<cite>\r\nNotice that instead
    of describing the boundary of the character, as the renaissance geometers did,
    my METAFONT system describes the curve traveled by the center of the pen, and
    the shape of this pen is allowed to vary as the pen moves. The main advantage
    of this approach is that the same definition readily yields a family of infinitely
    many related fonts of type, each font being internally consistent. The change
    in pens size is governed by cubic splines in a manner analogous to the motion
    of the pen's center. In order to define the 20 or so different type fonts used
    in various places in my books, I need for the most part to use only three kinds
    of pens, namely (i) a circular pen, used for example to draw dots and at the base
    of the numeral '7'; (ii) a horizontal pen, whose shape is an ellipse, the width
    being variable but the height being constantly equal to the height of a hairline
    pen - such a pen is used most of the time, and in particular to draw all of the
    numerale '3' except for the dots; (iii) a vertical pen, analogous to the horizontal
    one, used for example to draw the strokes at the bottom of the '2' and the top
    of the '5' and the '7'.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/americanmoderndigits_5727.png]\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    font was a predecessor of the Computer Modern family (written in old METAFONT78)
    and was obviously only PEN based. But then he rewrote the font completely for
    the new METAFONT84 and then he used nearly exclusively OUTLINE constructions (pens
    were only used to draw round edges). I guess somewhere inbetween 1978 and 1984
    Knuth \"understood that defining expanded skeletons is non-optimal\".\r\n\r\n@sgh:\r\n<cite>\r\nAs

    defined outlines and filled them (and drew the outline also with a pen):\r\n\r\nFirst
    citation from the Computer Modern source file romanu.mf (the important command
    is filldraw which means <strong>filling</strong> and drawing alltogether):\r\n<code>\r\ncmchar
    \"The letter I\";\r\nbeginchar(\"I\",max(6u#,4u#+cap_stem#),cap_height#,0);\r\nitalcorr
    cap_height#*slant-.25u#;\r\nadjust_fit(cap_serif_fit#,cap_serif_fit#);\r\npickup
    tiny.nib; pos1(cap_stem,0); pos2(cap_stem,0);\r\nlft x1l=lft x2l=hround(.5w-.5cap_stem);
    top y1=h; bot y2=0;\r\nfilldraw stroke z1e--z2e; % stem\r\nif serifs: dish_serif(1,2,a,1/3,1.05cap_jut,b,1/3,1.05cap_jut);
    \ % upper serif\r\n dish_serif(2,1,c,1/3,1.05cap_jut,d,1/3,1.05cap_jut);  fi %
    lower serif\r\nmath_fit(0,.5ic#); penlabels(1,2); endchar;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nSecond
    citation from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont|Wikipedia]]:\r\n<cite>\r\nMore
    complex fonts such as the Roman text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a
    small pen to trace around the outline of the visual \"strokes\", which are then
    filled; the result is much like an outline font, but with slightly softened corners
    defined by the pen shape.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd finally a colored image of the
    letter \xABI\xBB from cmssbx10, showing the statement above:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmssbx10-16_3545.png]\r\n\r\n*if*
    Knuth had really used pens only for the stems, they would behave correctly when
    being slanted, what they obviously not do:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Y_LMSans10-Oblique_5859.png]\r\n(The
    three stems have all different widths, but should have same widths.)"

  body: "\"This typeface adds absolutely nothing to the existing typefaces\"\r\nI
    don't think that would be true even if this weren't a MF typeface. Well, I don't
    know much about MF but I assumed there is a huge gap in the market for a well
    thought-out and very expanded (in terms of weights, widths and optical sizes)
    typeface like this. A typeface like Athelas also doesn't really bring anything
    new to the table yet I absolutely adore that typeface and it rightfully received
    an award. Besides, it seems silly to write a font off based on the caps. There's
    still quite some room for \"new\" elements in the lowercase even if many of the
    rules are already defined by the caps.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there's something about
    the 'A' which I find refreshing. Perhaps the angle of its top is a bit unconventional
    for an orthodox typeface. In any case I like it a lot.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I do
    have a few minor issues with some of your glyphs.\r\n- 'S' seems a tiny, tiny
    bit too heavy in its spine nearing the top.\r\n- Horizontal strokes in letters
    like 'E', 'L' and 'Z' could be a tiny bit more bold. Right now I think it contrasts
    a bit too much with thin diagonal strokes.\r\n- 'H' could be a little bit wider
    I think.\r\n- The bowl of 'P' could be a little bit higher. At least, I like the
    bowl to take up a little bit more space vertically compared to the 'R' to fill
    a little bit more of the space below the bowl. I think this gives the text a more
    even color.\r\n- 'Z' could be a tiny bit more narrow.\r\n\r\nThe 85% slant in
    the diacritics seems perfect by the way.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "fujito, as a LaTeX type user--not a designer--and fan of oldstyle typefaces,
    I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the results of this project.\r\n\r\nFor a
    while, I used metapost (the adaptation of metafont for creating Postscript figures).
    \ To me, metafont/metapost itself is beautiful.  I'm not talking about what is
    produced by it, or even Knuth's conception of essential components of typefaces
    (I have no opinion about that debate above) but rather that the programming concepts
    on which the metafont/metapost system is based--the concepts involved in writing
    a program--themselves have beauty.  Eventually I became frustrated with limitations
    of metapost--limitations which were the result of Knuth having written metafont
    in an era when computers had severe memory and speed limitations compared to recent
    computers.  Now I use easier methods of constructing diagrams, and am not sorry
    that I don't have to wrestle with metapost, but I still think of it as a beautiful
    thing--something from a past era.\r\n\r\nSo it's fascinating to me that metafont
    still has functionality that's of value on its own today, despite the existence
    of modern font design programs.\r\n\r\nVery cool project--especially the ability
    to parameterize modernness vs. oldstyle."

      body: "There were only a few things in MetaPost that gave me problems, although
        I remember that there were some quirky aspects of programming it.  (Some of
        the quirks were elegant; others were simply arbitrary.)  The one real problem
        that I remember now is that I was trying to make a simple diagram with a fluid
        curve on top, and roughly rectangular regions below it.   I used a trigonometric
        function to make the curve, and at some point I wanted MetaPost to do calculations
        that were too fine-grained for it.  I'm not sure whether that was for the
        details of controlling the curve, or maybe for approximate calculations of
        areas of regions below it.  Or maybe I had problems with both.  I think that
        I found I was able to control the curve only to a degree, and if I tried to
        go further than that, the curve behaved oddly.   I think I also wanted certain
        2-D regions to have specific total areas, despite being under different parts
        of the curve.  I recall using a simple approximation of the kind used to generate
        integrals in the limit.  Metapost either errored out, or produced weird results--I
        don't recall.  My conclusion was that Metapost just didn't have enough bits
        in its representations of numbers.  They weren't regular floating point numbers;
        they were something that was hand-coded into MetaFont/MetaPost.  That's what
        I thought at the time, anyway.  I didn't look at the source for more than
        a minute or two, if that.  That's what I mean by being limited by the era
        in which Knuth wrote the Metafont.  He needed to get a certain job done, and
        he needed to save memory, and he figured out a way to do what he wanted to
        do with the sort of memory limitations he had by constructing numbers and
        numerical routines that were very compact.  That's what I think, though I
        could be wrong.\r\n\r\nEasier methods:  I've used xfig a lot over the years.
        \ I love it.  The interface is odd, and could be more convenient in some ways,
        but within the fairly broad limits of what it does, it allows a lot of control
        over diagrams.  There are tools that do the same sort of thing with nicer
        interfaces, but xfig is free, and I know it.  Other than that, I've used various
        things.  Whatever I am aware of about that's available and useful.  I've used
        GIMP, ImageMagick, OS X Grapher, Gnuplot--sometimes with Octave as a front
        end, and one or two programs whose names I forgot a long time ago.  I might
        start using Matlab or Mathematica at some point for mathematical graphics."
