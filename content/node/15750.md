  body: I believe the software used by most students at Berklee College of Music,
    including my brother (although he has since graduated), to compose music is Sibelius
    -- http://www.sibelius.com/cgi-bin/home/home.pl -- many different levels. I think
    my brother has also used Finale. Not sure.

  body: "Thank you both for your comments. Those were the two programs I had heard
    about (I was hoping there might be others).\r\n\r\nI found this article: \r\nhttp://www.jefferycotton.net/info.asp?pgs=hairpin\r\n\r\nIt
    would seem to say that Finale is the better choice, as does most of the chatter
    on the web on the subject. But I wonder if it is not a Quark versus InD debate...\r\n\r\nTiffany,
    if your brother has used both, I would love to know what his feelings are on the
    subject!\r\n\r\n- Robert"

    your scanner to drop a handwritten score into Sibelius. The handwritten score
    has to be neat and tidy for the program to pick up everything, though, and may
    require some adjustments.\r\n\r\nK."

    but I haven't had any need as of late. If you like the way the Henle* editions
    are set, you should like the results with Score. \r\n\r\n*Henle doesn't used Score,
    but they are widely available engraved editions that are a joy to read. "

  body: "Thanks for the LilyPond link! That is exactly what I needed.\r\n\r\n(I am
    working on a project that has a few short musical examples)\r\n\r\nLilyPond is
    effecient for engraving already written music, and the results look very good,
    but I wouldn't want to try to compose in it, however...\r\n\r\nFor Score, I found
    this link, by the way\r\nhttp://www.scoremus.com/\r\n\r\nI agree, the Henle editions
    are beautiful!"
