  body: "Already much earlier did Adobe made a typeface open source, this was an early
    version of Utopia. It can be found searching the web for \u201Cadobe utopia latex\u201D.
    However this version of Utopia was even further improved (hopefully) and expanded
    and is released under the name Heuristica/Evristika, the latter being the russian
    transliteration of its name. \r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/evristika/"

  body: "flooce - that jogged my memory big time :) \r\nX11 still bundles Utopia,
    but it's not installed in the default X11 fonts. I'm curious if the original 'free'
    utopia release was just the fonts, or source files too, and might they still be
    still knocking around?\r\nthanks"

  body: Thanks.  The files provided at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utopia
    are same as the original fonts donated from Adobe. First donated in '92, kept
    in 'free/not free limbo' for 14 years, and finally confirmed as free 2006. Or
    something like that.
