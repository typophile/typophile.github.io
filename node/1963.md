    We already had this one</a>, and we couldn&#39;t ID it. Sorry Bernard.

    target="_blank"> Dispose</a>, a truly innovative  <BR>modern-retro face in a similar
    vein, and far better than  <BR>your sample IMHO.

  body: I had a look at Lee Fasciani &#40;well, a tiny look as that&#39;s all their
    web site seams to allow&#41;. I prefer the straight horizontals of the acens font.
    You can get a better look at it here by the way. <a href="http://www.acens.com"
    target="_blank">http://www.acens.com</a> It&#39;s a Madrid based company. I&#39;m
    in the process of writing to them to ask but my spanish isn&#39;t top notch so
    it&#39;s taking me time.

  body: Well, they use <a href="http://www.thefoundrystudio.co.uk/monoline_medium.html"
    target="_blank"> Foundry Monoline</a> extensively on their  <BR>website, so this
    confirms my original hunch that the  <BR>logo might be a customized version of
    that face.

  body: Nice font choice Adriano. The devil is in the details as they say. <BR>I wrote
    to Summa Designs in Spain &#40;they designed the logo for Acens&#41;. From their
    web site, they seem to have done quite a few font customization on other projects.
    Too bad if that&#39;s the case here. <BR>and thanks Yves for identifying the other
    font used for text. Where can one buy Foundry Monoline. Their web site is very
    bare on info. <BR>BTW, your link seems old. Their new address is <BR><a href="http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk"

    </a> company uses a quite similar face <BR>&#40;not an exact match either but
    perhaps a bit closer&#41;

  body: Got a reply from the design firm. <BR>The logo was hand drawn. <BR>Web site
    wasn&#39;t done by them by the way. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know what to think of
    the Clearasil <BR>logo. I&#39;d love to see what they had before they <BR>botched
    it with an outline. Their web site is  <BR>atrocious too. Very invasive. <BR>
