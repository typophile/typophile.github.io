    why is it called &#34;semi-serif&#34; &#40;it&#39;s a sans&#41;, and why is it
    in the &#34;serif&#34; forum?!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, wherever this belongs/ends_up,
    could you provide a Flash version, or failing that, some close-ups? <BR> <BR>hhp '

    There are so many... This is especially important if you want to be able to mix

    well a sans would fare if based heavily on a serif. I&#39;m in the market for
    an extremely readable sans for text, and one that came at least a little close
    to the readability of Caslon would be a dream come true. '

    <BR>I personally wouldn&#39;t call Cronos a copy, but I think it does &#34;rip
    off&#34; some significant innovations from Today. And it doesn&#39;t make me happier
    to see Adobe get a TDC award for it, not to mention a &#42;patent&#42; on it.
    &#40;But they also got a patent on &#42;Garamond&#42;, so...&#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
    something too: <BR><A HREF="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/cronos.html" TARGET="_top">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/cronos.html</A>
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Slimbach &amp; Co.&#39;s Myriad always seemed like a Frutiger &#34;appropriation&#34;
    to me <BR> <BR>And to Frutiger, from what I understand. <BR> <BR>&#62; Today is
    the most tightly-spaced sans I&#39;ve ever worked with. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s actually
    a good thing, even -no, especially- in text setting. The letters have to meld
    into words &#40;they have to become less letters&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve come
    to believe that contemporary standards of spacing are too loose. The metal boys
    couldn&#39;t space much tighter than they did - but we can. There is certainly
    such a thing as too-tight spacing, but Today I feel is just right. <BR> <BR>And
    I&#39;ll note here that the good readability of Times is due to its very tight
    spacing - overcoming its deficiencies &#40;which could be attributed to its unintelligent
    conversion to digital&#41; in terms of lightness and contrastiness. <BR> <BR>Tight
    tracking in headlines is largely a matter of taste - but in headlines, largely
    function. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: ' I agree that something just doesn&#39;t feel right. I think that the problem
    may be in the terminals. Seeing the s with its beaks still intact, for example
    makes the d etc. look like they need their serifs. Another example would be the
    c, with its ball. Right now these characters, which basically have escaped modification
    do make the face feel closer to the serifs than other sans-romans, which is part
    of the charm of the face. I do think they could be toned back to match the other
    characters, though. I would definitely try to keep a two story g, for example,
    but the terminal on the top of the f could be sheared off, or treated differently. '
