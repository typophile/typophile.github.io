  and I am very confused about the settings I have to choose through my desktop publishing
  application. QuarkXpress in particular.\r\nAs you know, newspapers use halftoning
  effect, so here's the problem.\r\nWhat do I have to choose under the 'color' tab
  for the halftoning? Conventional or printer? What frequency? 85-95lpi wouldn't be
  a good one? Also what style? Grayscale?\r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP!"

    supervisor.

    the only designer, there should be some existing standards to follow. Can you
    open up old files and see how they were done?\r\n\r\nBut definitely talk to the
    press supervisor. I used to work at a newspaper, and because of all the factors
    of printing on newsprint and their ancient presses, they way we did things was
    VERY unusual, and tailored to get the best quality (if you can call it that) from
    what we had to work with. Without talking to your press person, you'll just be
    doing a lot of guessing."

  body: "The press supervisor, KNOWS NOTHING.\r\nI asked him in what LPI does he print
    and he told me about the DPI. As a matter of fact,  he meant the PPI.(300) Anyhow...\r\nOld
    and present files (as I told you grayscale prints) were and are printed with CMYK
    and conventional halftoning to 95 lpi.\r\nI made a couple of changes in normal
    paper, to test the quality and they were much better. (grayscale instead of CMYK,
    I changed the dot to print, in default selection blows everything up, like gradients
    etc)\r\nI guess I'll have to figure it out by myself and I hope with your help
    I will understand that the options I use are not only satisfying but also CORRECT,
    because as you said, there are particular standards for OFFSET printing.\r\nSorry
    for my bad English. =)"
