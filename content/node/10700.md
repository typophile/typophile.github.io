  body: Miguel, <BR> <BR>This is the best pixel script I&#39;ve seen. <BR>It&#39;s
    very much a lo-res FB Rocket <BR>&#40;<A HREF="http://www.fontbureau.com/specimens/rocket.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.fontbureau.com/specimens/rocket.html</A>&#41; <BR>I think
    it could be very useful, and  <BR>certainly marketable if you ever wish <BR>to
    sell it. <BR> <BR>Is a light weight companion possible? <BR> <BR>Stephen

  body: I ask and receive. Very nice. It certainly  <BR>doesn&#39;t have the power
    of the bold, but it works,  <BR>and gives a designer a second option. <BR> <BR>Now
    show me a Futura Display at 12 pixels high. <BR>and I will name my firstborn son

    &#40;I think&#41;, which I never bought: over-priced. The other, I don&#39;t remember...
    :-/  Sorry. <BR> <BR>But bascially it uses circles of three different sizes placed
    on a 3x3 grid to create the glyph image. It&#39;s UC-only &#40;I think&#41;. <BR>

    solves many problems. <BR> <BR>btw miguel - i have tried numereous times to create
    the smallest font. and there are infinite number of problems. in the end &#40;which
    i hope wont be your end&#41;, i quitted and flexed the font so much until it became
    just a normal sized screen font <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
