    Serif No. 2</strong>, which is based on Gill Sans, but has a narrower M and N,
    and a somewhat straighter leg on the R.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not aware of a digital
    version but, then, I\u2019m not all that hep to this interweb stuff\u2026"

  body: "Is this an old document? Because the original Gill Sans (or even a previous-era
    clone of it) had optical scaling, and one thing that larger sizes would be is
    narrower. Ergo: you might not find a digital version of this.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The join of the leg on the R is smooth in your sample, and definitely not
    in the Intertype face. The homogenized widths led me to believe that this might
    be a hot-metal face, but Linotype didn\u2019t offer a Gill alternative, and I\u2019m
    not hep to the scooby-doo about Ludlow.\r\n\r\nIn which case, I would have to
    agree with Hrant that it\u2019s probably a predigital version, with the width
    finagled for the particular size of this font."
