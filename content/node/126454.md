  font \"RAINBOW ROOM\", (I think the key is in the head at the top of the \"A\").\r\nI
  find it very interesting, I have seen similars, but I need the exact name of this.\r\nI
  hope you can help me please...\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing:\r\nDoes the style o classification
  of these sources like \"ENGRAVERS - SWEET S. - BLAIR\" have any particular name?"

  body: "\"Rainbow Room\" is similar to Sackers Gothic Light manually extended a bit
    but not exactly\u2026the 'B' is not quite right.  As to its classification, I
    have seen these sometimes referred to copperplate sans serifs.  \"Rockefeller
    Center\" is not DIN. Not sure what it is but it is very close to Proxima Nova
    Semibold. "
