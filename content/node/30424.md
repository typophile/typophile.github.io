  body: "Did you mean computer tablet (input device) or tablet computer (type of portable
    computer)?\r\n\r\nIf you can get used to absolute positioning, and take the time
    to exploit pressure sensitivity in the applications that can understand it, it
    will totally change your digital art.\r\n\r\nI've used Wacoms before. I bought
    a 6x8 generic labeled US Logic pad, and it works fantastically (when I can find
    my stylus). It cost 43 dollars with shipping on eBay <a href=\"http://cgi.ebay.com/Graphic-Tablet-New_W0QQitemZ150078388543QQihZ005QQcategoryZ3680QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem\">Something
    like this</a>.\r\nPros - It's huge, sensitive and drivers were stable. \r\nCons
    - theres a AAA battery in the pen, (lasts forever), only one input end (no \"eraser\")
    and it only affects the primary monitor.\r\n\r\nA same-sized Wacom is nicer, but
    I don't know if it is 10x better. Supposedly they are multimonitor friendly. Perhaps
    if it recognized pen twists much more clearly it would be a more obvious winner.\r\n\r\n\r\n<A

    with a 9x12 intuos 3 that I use for serious photo retouching and other things
    that come along. When I really get serious about it I actually clamp one of my
    LCDs to my drawing table and lay the big tablet on there, it's a very sweet setup.\r\n\r\nWacom
    does sell fully-functional tablets at a pretty nice academic discount if you're
    eligible (or just feel like comping up a fake  course schedule) Academicsuperstore.com
    and sprysoft.com both sell the discounted tablets.  \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that
    Wacom's intuos tablets cost so much because they come with a lifetime warranty,
    driver updates that last as long as the OS can support the hardware (Wacom eventually
    dropped the old hardware because of hardware support problems Apple created in
    OS X, but otherwise provides great support for old models), and because Adobe
    designs its apps to work with Wacom tablets. Not to mention that they're super-sensitive
    and a dream to use."
