  body: "The football (soccer) letters by Puma, Nike, and Adidas usually aren't fonts,
    and don't have names per se. A number of people take the time to create computer
    fonts from the images available in uniform kits or from images such as the pictures
    of the jerseys that you've attached.\r\n\r\nOn the following site, what the site
    author refers to as 'fonts' are the images that are available upon request (I
    don't know if he charges for them); they're most often in raster form but sometimes
    they're vectors.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.switchimageproject.com/2011/11/puma-oh-puma.html]]\r\n\r\n

    I think is really attractive and interesting, one of my favourite new designs

    doesn't seem to do anything to push them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think it works quite well. It reads surprisingly clearly \u2013 compared
    to the usual compact, all-caps sans it's very legible with its large, open counters.\r\n\r\nThe
    fact that it's badly spaced on the shirt is another matter. And I much prefer
    the flat version to the faux-3D one on the italy shirts."
