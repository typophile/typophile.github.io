  about it. \r\n\r\nIn light of Requiem, I'd be interested to see how a lowercase
  Trajan Pro would look. Imagine that . . .\r\n\r\n"

    a beautiful typeface, but I prefer it in titles. In my opinion it's too refined
    to perform well in long texts. \r\nMaybe the magazine use a too light version. "

  body: "It comes in a Display, Text, and Fine version, with Text being the meatiest
    of the three. Perhaps the magazine is using the fine version. Although it also
    depends on the paper. \r\n\r\nIt's a delicate face, any way you slice it. There
    is no bold. But I must say that at sizes of 11-13 pt. it's less ornate and easier
    to read than, say, Renard or Trinite (which are both awesomely beautiful in their
    own right.)"

    I am not sure if they ever used the text weight. For my eyes the text weight is
    still something that sparkles too much for long texts. However, that said, I would
    use it for brochure or catalog use. I guess I'm contradicting myself. For sub-titles
    and bylines you could use the text. This is, IMHO, another typeface that is so
    gorgeous and so rich that too much of it will cause indigestion. However, the
    right amount of it adds texture and flavor.

  body: I second Wilson's comment, the "Y," and I would add the "R," are enough to
    make me want to buy it.

  body: "I have it, and it's well worth the money.\r\n\r\nIt works well for body text,
    but it needn't be used too much for that, although the temptation is there. For
    titling or display purposes, it is similar to Trajan but much less stolid.\r\n\r\nOn
    paper at 600-1200 dpi, it's gorgeous."

    text, after a while I just got to put it aside and look for alternatives :) It's
    a excelent typeface, specialy for titles but as people said, it's not the perfect
    text font, I always wish there was a bolder weight. \r\n\r\nExcelent choice Palatine
