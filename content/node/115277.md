body: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nLooking to find out what font is used for the \"Thirst Quencher\"
  bit. Or at least something really close to it! I assume this is NOT a custom typeface,
  given how much it is used on the label, etc. I also assume this treatment has been
  skewed. Or maybe this is the italic form?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot

  be in the same font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot 2014-03-26
