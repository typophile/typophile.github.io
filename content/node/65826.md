  body: "Maybe it's the fuzziness of the sample, but the S doesn't seem exactly right
    for Univers. The ends (correct type term?) don't seem to reach high/low enough?
    Same with the C. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/univers_4136.png]"

  body: You are correct, but frankly I wouldn't know what else it could be. Different
    version/digitisation?

  body: No, me either. It's not Linotype's or Adobe's. And it's not Bitstream's Zurich.
    Hmm.

  body: "I beg to differ. Apart from the S spine, the top of the A seems to be broader.
    Also, the R appears to be higher-waisted and to have a tailed leg. \r\nHere\u2019s
    a comparison of Univers Light Ultra Condensed and Helvetica Ultra Compressed.
    Note the terminals of J and S.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/horner_6508.gif]"

  body: "Darnit, you could be right. If we assume the type was eroded by the poor
    image quality Helvetica Ultra Compressed could be it.\r\n\r\nI have also just
    noticed that starting from the medium weight the tail on the R in <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-pro/\">Akzidenz
    Grotesk Condensed</a> takes on a Helvetica-like appearance (but the middle arm
    on the E is also too low)."
