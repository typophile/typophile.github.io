  quite a bit and I cannot find a site which gives  you lots of examples of complimentary
  fonts. The \"big\" sites might give you an example of the type face in a particular
  use, but non make suggestions what to combine it with. (bit like <cite>\"people
  who bought this font also bought..... \"</cite>(Amazonism)) Surely someone would
  have set up a site where you type in a font and automatically a list of analogous,
  complimentary fonts would roll out... Does anyone know about such a site?\r\n\r\nBe
  great if you would like to share this.\r\nW"

    it's hardly condoning physiognomy. It's type. Not people. Maybe if you place the
    importance of type up there with human life, but I believe Wim had a reasonable
    request that, if one is so inclined, a reasonable response be offered.\r\n\r\nWim:\r\n\r\nI'm
    not aware of any such site in particular\u2026 myfonts.com will let you search
    by keyword. The most recent issue of Communication Arts has an article by [[Jonathan
    Hoefler]] about mixing types. Chapter 6 of Robert Bringhurst's [[Elements of Typographic
    Style]] has a chapter about choosing and mixing type ( ch.6 ) as well. You might
    try a search of this site, or if you could be more specific, maybe the kind folks
    here could give some suggestions.\r\n\r\nOh, and welcome to the forums!"

  body: "See this thread; <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/18342\">Good book
    about type mixing</a>\r\n\r\nAs Eben Sorkin stated simply in a related thread,
    \"the eye is the final arbiter\", I  think this is true in finding complementary
    type solutions. Books covering the basics of type and typography such as Bringhurst\u2019s
    <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0881791326/102-4072842-3990505?v=glance&n=283155\">The
    Elements of Typographic Style</a> should give you a basic understanding on how
    to complement a typeface.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I'm an obsessive magazine collector
    and I usually take notice of good type combinations and \"steal\" them, not necessarily
    down to the exact typeface itself but it's overall style.\r\n\r\nI think it's
    very important to be able to recognize which typefaces are suitable for display
    or text, or both. It is usually unwise to pair two \u201Cstrictly\u201D display
    faces. Also, I like to try and find complementary typefaces with similar x-heights,
    but in the end it all comes down to how it looks. You decide. \r\n\r\nI hope this
    helps."

    Times for newspaper publications, comic sans for 8 yr old birthday party invitations,

    usages that appeal \u2013 seems more productive than following a list provided
    by a group (or individual). A list of specific uses would only be broad generalisations
    more restrictive than guidance. \r\n\r\nI could see the idea of creating an \"also
    bought\" feature might be a good sales tool for some smaller sites (individual
    designers/foundries) but larger (purely retail) sites would have to step carefully
    to avoid offence to their suppliers.\r\n\r\nTim"

    of what was the original intended use of the typeface. This would still leave
    it's use expandable upon while giving a general baseline for a more specific application.
    \r\n\r\nThe idea being more than the broad understanding that Serif fonts are
    great for small body copy and San-Serif fonts for Display and Titling. \r\n\r\nThere
    are definitely fonts out there with the ability to perform both tasks equally,
    but was that the designers original intention? Aside from some of the more unique
    fonts available, I'd assume that most traditional fonts were designed with great
    versatility in mind."

    So now when I decide to use Serif for heads, sans for body, or both, I will be
    derided for \"wrong use.\"\r\n\r\n"
