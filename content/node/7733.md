  news is prompting me to cut to the chase... I have spent months reading everything
  I could here, learned more than I could imagine and also became more intimidated,
  by type, than I could have imagined. I love typophile and am looking forward to
  becoming a vocal member of the community now.  <BR> <BR>Very briefly, I graduated
  from the University of Illinois Graphic Design program a year and a half ago. Since
  then I have been working doing design and testing my hand at type design on the
  side. I have recently decided to go back to school to delve into type design more
  full time and explore some different directions for life. <BR> <BR>Here is, what
  I see as, the interesting part... I am going back to school to work in ceramics.
  I am hoping to work on connections between type design and ceramic sculpture. While
  I was in school the &#34;design&#34; people and &#34;studio&#34;  people were polar
  opposites; I always walked the line between the two groups.  <BR> <BR>Until tonight
  I was convinced this was a unique idea. Then about an hour ago I received an e-mail
  from Emigre where Zuzana explores correlations of type and ceramics. Here is a short
  essay Zuzana has about this topic: <BR> <BR><a href="http://emigre.com/CType.php"
  target="_blank">http://emigre.com/CType.php</a> <BR> <BR>So I don&#39;t know where
  I am going with this, other than I was taken off guard by that e-mail. Completely
  original ideas can be hard to come by I guess.  <BR> <BR>clay and letters... still
  exciting definitely'

  body: That is a great article, thanks for posting Rob! <BR> <BR>I know nothing of
    ceramics, and I&#39;m not a type designer, but I believe an integration of various
    disciplines and explorations of mediums outside of what you may be used to, is
    extremely beneficial in any field. I recall my first sculpture class, I had been
    trained to utilize tools for [and think] on a flat surface for so long and then
    suddenly being confronted with three dimensional objects, this was slightly daunting.
    I soon gained great comfort in it and only then began to understand, more thoroughly,
    forms modelled on a flat surface. <BR> <BR>May I ask, what made you decide to
    investigate ceramics? <BR> <BR><i>While I was in school the &#34;design&#34; people
    and &#34;studio&#34; people were polar opposites</i> <BR> <BR>I know exactly what
    you mean. I am in a design school currently, and the majority of the school is
    based on visual arts. The designers are in a kept seperate building from the artists,
    and neither one seems to understand the other. The designers are constantly critiquing
    things like their use of type, and the artists see us as corporate sell-outs &#40;at
    least this is what I hear&#41;.

  body: 'ah yes, real artists and the sell outs...  <BR> <BR>I had a professor that
    could create interesting relationships out of any combination of elements. Her
    masters thesis dealt with Graphic Design and Japanese Tea Ceremony. <BR> <BR>Ceramics
    is my other love, along with design; seemingly completely opposite though. 3D
    vs 2D, hands on vs computerized, messy and emotional vs precise and rational...
    I see those as broad differences, yet generalizations, between the two disciplines.
    However, if you take one area out of context and replicate it in another environment
    there can be interesting results. This is nothing new, there have been nearly
    every kind of typeface designed: refined, proportional perfect faces, gritty,
    spontaneous ones, trompe l&#39;oeil... obviously not everything though. <BR> <BR>Basically
    what I am trying to get at is this: I am hoping to discover new things about letterforms
    by working three dimensionally with them, and with my hands. I see this also as
    the perfect opportunity to help bring together artists and designers with this
    body of work. There should be something for everyone, both groups of audiences
    at least. Hopefully, ideally, it will be somewhat educational as well. <BR> <BR>A
    major difference between what I hope to do and what Zuzana is working on is that
    she is going somewhat farther with her comparison of pots and letters. She is
    finding similarities with her thrown pieces that relate to characteristics of
    individual letters. My focus is more literal, actual letterforms, in various incarnation,
    produced in clay. <BR> <BR>In regards to ceramics though, I had not yet thought
    about one of her points. She states: <BR> &#34;not be worked and reworked for
    very long, as the clay becomes water logged and stressed. A piece of ceramics
    ultimately exists as a static entity, whereas each letter in a typeface is designed
    to work in conjunction with the other letters, in virtually any combination, and
    so, the appearance of the typeface in use will differ, depending on the particular
    letter combinations and typographic setting.&#34; <BR> <BR>I will have to figure
    out how my work of individual letters fits in with this very important concept
    of type design- it IS about the sum of the whole. However, in my case, I think
    it the individual letter ARE more important because they are what goes unnoticed
    so often. If I was to start stringing together letter people would look at it
    more for what it says than for what it is. This is about the appreciation of a
    well designed letter, and the subtle differences between different faces. How
    many peopler can identify Times, Baskerville, Caslon, Garamond, or Hoefler if
    you typed it out for them? Many see a serif face and call it Times New Roman.'

  body: Rob, Welcome! <BR> <BR>&#62; I always walked the line between the two groups.  <BR>
    <BR>Good for you. <BR> <BR>I think sculpture and type are strongly related! Although
    I do agree about the dimensional difference issue. But the bit about sculpture
    being unlike type in that it&#39;s a &#34;static entity&#34; doesn&#39;t sound
    right, because people put stuff in their pots, and they put those pots in rooms!
    <BR> <BR>I would recommend taking a deep look at the work of Takenobu Igarashi.

  body: Hi Rob, <BR> <BR>Glad your chiming in! I recall from an early Typecon that
    Miles Newlyn had a pension for dimensional type whereby creating type to work
    dimensionally. I hope he reads this post and replies with some examples of his
    thoughts . . . <BR> <BR>As for me when I read your post I instantly thought of
    a point in my type design career when I had spent so much time designing fonts
    &#40;virtual software&#41; that I needed to gratify my need for something tactile
    and built a drink machine . . . <BR> <BR>:D

    just reminded me of something from back then! He was working on this logo for
    a Spanish company, and he had the basis -or at least an instance- of it in his

  body: The essay from Zuzana Licko makes a connection I have long been aware of,
    thanks to a late relative who was a master potter.  <BR> <BR>I once had the great
    pleasure of visiting a museum&#39;s ceramics collection with her, and the commentary
    was amazing. Not only could she discuss just from the pot the personality and
    working conditions of the potterer-sometimes hundreds of years gone-but also would
    comment on the curves of the sillouette, and on how it was &#39;weak&#39; or proud,
    or whatever. And when she said it, you could see it.  <BR> <BR>In pottery the
    material and glaze is of course very important, but to a great extent pottery
    is, like type &#39;about the curves&#39;.  <BR> <BR>They are so close that, as
    Licko says, the differences are also fascinating. On of the differences is that
    in type the relationships between shapes is paramount, whereas in the pot, its
    single shape is the thing.

  body: Hrant, thanks for pointing me towards Takenobu Igarashi. I have been looking
    around for whatever I can scrounge up on him, hopefully I can get my hands on
    a book or two...  <BR> <BR>In the process of all this I came across a couple interesting
    old posts. It seems like art and design seem to come together once a year. <BR>

    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>So here is the next question... How important are individual
    letters? What is the significance of a letterform outside the context of writing?
    When designing typefaces you have to create one letter at a time, and when doing
    so &#40;I assume&#41; you attempt to give it a beautiful or unique form. However,
    when using these beautiful or unique letters it is more important that they work
    together than how look alone &#40;this is all aside from pure decoration&#41;.
    I have read about several typefaces that have been created solely for their legibility
    characteristics; I would not expect those individual letters to be the most elegant.
    <BR> <BR>this is great... <BR>r.k

  body: I studied both ceramics and graphic design in college and I always thought
    there was a very deep connection between them. I still recommend design students
    take a ceramics class. Throwing pots is entirely about negative space since the
    potter ultimately shapes the interior of the pot, not the exterior. All the force
    used to shape the pot is applied from the inside out. The outer form arrives only
    as a result of the interior form. <BR> <BR>As for Licko&#39;s &#34;static&#34;  refernce
    she&#39;s absolutely right. You can put stuff in pots and put pots in a room,
    but that&#39;s meaningless to the pots. They don&#39;t need the room or the stuff,
    they exist on their own. Letters, ultimately need each other in order to function.
    Alone they&#39;re just as &#34;static&#34; as the pot.  <BR> <BR>Alone a letter
    is only an aesthetic object. It may be readable as a letter, but it doesn&#39;t
    need to be. It&#39;s just a shape. A typeface requires that a group of letters
    exist as a functional unit so their shapes are determined as much by the other
    letters as anything else.  <BR> <BR>george

  body: There&#39;s a strong tradition of ceramic letters being mass produced in the
    nineteenth century for shop signage an the like. <BR>You can find some reference
    to them in Nicolette Gray&#39;s writings, can&#39;t remember which book though,
    although I like all of it. <BR>I&#39;ve spent a lot of time doing three dimensional
    letters &#40;have you also seen the book &#39;dimensional typography&#39;&#41;
    for logos. <BR>I should be able to launch my website within the next week, you&#39;ll
    find reference to them there if you are interested.
