    the rest. It has a nice hand-carved look to it.\r\nI've just finished reading
    \"Goudy's Type Designs, His Story And Specimens\" and plenty of his work seems
    as rough.\r\n\r\nAt least this seems clean and has a nice weight- from what I
    can see. Plenty of room for improvement, but I would use it on a yardsale poster,
    or for a lost cat, without reservations."

    a prominent scholarly archive. \r\nI recognized it immediately (I use J-STOR all
    the time), so I looked an article up to see what it was supposed to look like,
    assuming that the original poster's computer was doing some funky font substitution.
    Lo and behold, I zoomed in and realized it looks the same on my computer too.
    Weird, and weird that I had never noticed that before."

  body: Academics have often had to fall back on amateur fonts in order to find support
    for the rare and unusual characters that they require. Often, such fonts are made
    by their colleagues, and are seldom of high aesthetic or technical quality.

  body: I've been whining about the JSTOR type for a while; it's just incredible how
    bad the Latin is. But I looked up Code 2000 not too long ago, and now I feel a
    bit bad about maligning it given that it has such an enormous language range.
    Are there any better drawn faces that JSTOR could substitute that would still
    allow them to set just about any language?

  body: I don't see anything wrong with the typeface itself, the problem I see is
    the application. I would consider it a display face, although it seems like it
    was designed to be a multi-purpose font. So maybe it's the right application after
    all...

    look at Gentium? I saw it for the first time today at the TOC Conference in New
    York. It was mentioned as an open source typeface with a huge range of unicode
    characters. It sets Russian, Chinese and math equations. Looked very nice on the
    big screen, with nice italics. Would love to hear what you guys think:\r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/CMS/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_basic"

  body: "Gentium covers a huge range of Latin-based alphabets and also covers basic
    Cyrillic and Greek. But it doesn't include Chinese characters. You must have seen
    it used in combination with another font that supports Chinese.\r\n\r\nCode2000,
    on the other hand, covers just about every writing system you can think of; take
    a look at the list at [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code2000]]. There are not
    many other fonts with even comparable coverage of the world's writing systems.\r\n\r\nA
    quick search reveals Code2000 includes 53,068 characters (63,546 glyphs) in version
    1.171. [[http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/indexe.htm|TITUS Cyberbit Unicode]]
    by comparison has 36,161 characters in version 4.0, and Gentium has around 1,500
    glyphs."

  body: "So this font usage *is* justified after all? One Font To Rule Them All?\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    it is -- no time slash money to check per case what font combos best suit plain
    text plus a smattering of other scripts. I always take my time to scan my library
    for the best font that <em>also</em> covers all characters I need -- it can take
    some time, finding, say, a Chinese font, with that particular requirement.\r\n\r\nGiven
    the sheer number of characters, I suspect class kerning is out of the picture
    :-) And the odd \"J\" must have been to save <em>one single</em> position in the
    glyph list, dubbing for the Cherokee eclectic \"TJ\".\r\n\r\nDoes Code2000 come
    with a real beta, or is that fused with the German double es?"
