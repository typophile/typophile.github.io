    my last year at the academy, two days a  <BR>week. And my stint at Digital Arts
    lasted for at least  <BR>half a  year.

  body: David, some internships are paid, depending on experience / portfolio. &#40;Unless
    of course you&#39;re in such demand that interns are beating your door down. We&#39;re
    not quite there yet.&#41; <BR> <BR>Zara, 6 to 12 weeks. Or as long as the intern
    can stand it.

  body: Angela, we didn&#39;t receive your letter / email. If you sent it by post,
    we&#39;ll give it a few more days. If you sent it by email please send it again.
    If you don&#39;t get a prompt reply then we still haven&#39;t gotten it. <BR>
    <BR>Daniel, any design student that isn&#39;t getting those skills better ask
    for a refund. It&#39;s no longer about designing with rubylith and paste-up but
    it&#39;s all about presentation skills - mounting and comping.

    attempt will be successful. <BR> <BR>And just to put everyone&#39;s mind at ease,
    x-acto skills are still an integral part of design education these days. And they
    even taught us a little about this &#34;rubylith&#34; stuff you speak of... in
