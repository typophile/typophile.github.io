  body: I would agree that it could be a number of Old English-style fonts roughed
    up, but if you look at the two O's you can see the distressing is the same.

  body: '[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/wedding/|Wedding]] is rendered
    more narowly as a starting point. The lower case Es look similar as well. IDK,
    if I was distressing a font and then redrawing the letters I might or might not
    do multiple versions. I have not seen the movie. Do you know if the font appears
    in the credits or just the title?'

  body: I haven't seen it either. I was thinking it may have been done just for the
    movie. I think it's meant to emulate old silent movie captions.

  body: And to look all churchy, which is very blood oriented. I've looked through
    some grunge versions but no match. It may be custom as you say. If it is out there,
    someone will find it.

    my movie poster and the on-screen titles: http://malvolio.apartment32.com the
    poster, and the DVD cover will use a combination of Trajan and the hand-lettered
    logo seen on the site.\r\n\r\nThe movie will probably use Univers Bold Extended
    for the main titles, and I'm leaning towards Goudy Old Style, or maybe Caslon
    for the end credits.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
