  my friend with his band's logo. I'm really inspired by this one that I've attached.\r\nAnyone
  know of anything that feels like this one?\r\nThanks for the help\r\nJenna"

  body: "Not sure how one would classify the DragonForce logo, except as ornate. Letterhead
    Fonts have their share of ornate looks, although with an old time flavor. I was
    scanning Comicraft's fonts and came across [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/adamantium/|Adamantium]],
    which says Metal Band to me. \r\n\r\nI think looking for other Metal Band looks
    may be more productive than trying to match the custom lettering of one group.\r\n\r\n-

    had their name handmade into a logo.\r\n\r\nJens"

  body: "I have always wanted to do a metal band logo as an ambigram. Maybe someday\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    as Mike suggested, keep looking at logos, but maybe try a different style as well.\r\n\r\n[[http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b49/Edroz/aaaaaaaaaaa2.jpg|Example]]\r\n\r\nTo
    me, all those logos look similar and none jump out at me. I think metal logos
    could use a bit of rethinking, as the same idea seems to be used across the board.\r\n\r\np@rick"

  body: "Jenna,\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of conventions when it comes to metal band
    logos. A lot of them use Old English or Blackletter fonts. The more extreme genres
    (black metal, death metal, grindcore) tend to use hand-drawn ambigrams that are
    symmetrical and hard to read. The pointier and scarier, the better. Often (depending
    on the band's style), occult symbols are worked into the logo (pentagrams for
    \"O\"'s, etc.). Do a Google search for \"death metal logos\", and you'll see what
    I mean.\r\n\r\nI think this tradition started because metal was an underground
    style of music, with a D-I-Y attitude similar to Punk. A lot of bands designed
    their own logos, without any design training. \r\n\r\nThe \"Dragonforce\" logo
    belongs to a genre called \"power Metal\" that is generally less dark and scary.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the more creative bands break these rules. But be aware that a lot of fans
    expect certain things from a band, just from the look of their logo.\r\n\r\n-
