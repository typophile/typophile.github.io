  Foundry announced (Press release)\r\nStrong focus on multi-script typography\r\n\r\nBrno,
  Czech Republic (February 2011) The new independent type foundry Rosetta released
  its website (www.rosettatype.com) and online store on January 2011. The foundry
  intends to provide typefaces for new and rapidly growing markets that require special
  language support for particular orthographies, languages and writing systems.\r\n\r\nRosetta
  was created by David B\u0159ezina and the prolific duo responsible for the successful
  foundry TypeTogether (www.type-together.com), Veronika Burian and Jos\xE9 Scaglione.
  The three Co-Founders are graduates of the University of Reading, which has a long
  standing tradition of research in non-latin typography.\r\n\r\n\"Most of commercial
  fonts cover only the basic Latin alphabet and some accented letters that are used
  in languages such as English, Spanish or German, but that is not enough for Central-European
  languages, let alone regions that require different scripts such as India, Russia
  or the Middle-East\" says David B\u0159ezina, COO and Co-Founder of Rosetta. \"As
  new economies expand, the need for high quality fonts that support their languages
  becomes evident and is long overdue\".\r\n\r\nAccording to recent studies* six of
  the ten most spoken languages of the world require a script other than Latin. Rosetta
  is a response to the increasing interest and need, within the global market, for
  multi-script typefaces that are both technically and aesthetically of the highest
  standard. \"The goal is not only to publish more typefaces with broader language
  support, but also to promote research and build a knowledge base in that area. In
  order to create fonts that are respectful of the cultural heritage of the different
  languages and writing systems we are collaborating with experienced specialists
  and consultants.\" says Burian.\r\n\r\nUp to this date, Rosetta's retail library
  features typefaces that provide support for pan-European Latin, Arabic, Greek, and
  Cyrillic for Slavic languages as well as for many Asian languages. This includes
  Maiola by Veronika Burian, Skolar, by David B\u0159ezina, and Nassim and Aisha by
  Titus Nemeth, all of them award-wining typefaces. In the coming months Rosetta's
  library will be joined by more quality text faces for various scripts, including
  Devanagari and Gujarati. Additionally Rosetta announced that it is also catering
  tailored type design and font customization services for corporate use and OEM.\r\n\r\nTo
