  body: Looks a bit like an old Letraset dry-transfer face called Cut In &#40;at least
    I think that&#39;s what I remember it as&#41; - I&#39;ll have to check out my
    old catalog for it. Mark Simonson would be able to verify this one.

  body: Good hunch Grant, but that&#39;s not it. Cut In is more mannered in a &#39;70s
    art deco kind of way, but the stroke treatment is the same. <BR> <BR>This does
    look awfully familiar...

  body: Of course you&#39;re correct Mark. Once I had my Letraset book in front of
    me, I was obviously wrong. I agree with you that it is very familiar - many it&#39;s
    because it&#39;s such a simple monoline face...

  body: It looks like a sort of template lettering I have a vague recollection of.
    Like the kind they use for those router lettering systems for making nameplates
    and door signs.

  body: I think it looks exactly like the kind of lettering that you got with a Leroy
    Lettering set. It uses an alphabet template and a pantograph-style pen that draws
    on the paper. Here&#39;s an <a href="http://www.tpub.com/engbas/3-35.htm" target="_blank">article
    about it</a>. I used one once in drafting class -- pretty tedious compared to
    a Mac, but that was about 40 years ago.
