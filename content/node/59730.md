body: "I am working on feature code and need the 3-letter designation for both Spanish
  and Portuguese. I have used ESP and POR and they work when tested in FontLab but
  since I am just guessing, I would like a more authoritative answer. I tried Google
  but get every other kind of code than the 3-letter cap used for locl feature. Anybody
  know the link or the answer\"\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: For the record, the correct tag for Portuguese is PTG. You've got the Spanish
    tag right.

  body: "This is just curiosity on my part; I see in <a href=\"http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag2.html\">Adobe's
    list of Language System Tags</a> DHV for Dhivehi whilst <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/OpenType/languagetags.aspx\">Microsoft's
    list</a> has DIV for Divehi. On Wikipedia, the language is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhivehi\">Dhivehi</a>
    (* or Divehi, or Mahi) and the tag is div. Which tag is correct?\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"

  body: "That Adobe page is an outdated version (probably v1.4) of the OpenType spec.
    The DHV tag has been deprecated. In OpenType coding, the correct language tag
    for Dhivehi is DIV.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the OT spec provides correspondence
    with the ISO 639 language IDs: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/languagetags.htm"

  body: "By the way, the OT language system tags are actually four characters long,
    not three. But almost all of them have only three letters and a padding space
    character, e.g. 'DIV\_'. Most tools allow you to use only the three letters and
    add the padding automatically. There are a couple of four-letter language system
    codes defined though, and probably more will be defined in future."
