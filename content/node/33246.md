body: "Hello Typophiles - \r\n\r\nI recently added some new turkish characters to
  a client's proprietary font in order to update their webpage - it was a windows
  font, and I saved it and republished as Windows OTF (with FontStudio 5.0.2). When
  I did this and tested the new font in my flash movie, it seems that all the characters
  have shifted, and the space between lines has increased to break my original design.
  \r\n\r\nWhat could I have done to break the verticle metrics and where do i fix
  this? Could I have changed the verticle metric values for the glyphs adding new
  characters? or by saving into a new format? Any help or a point in the right direction
  would really be helpful as this was my first small, but professional type assignment.\r\n\r\nThank
  you\r\n\r\n-J\r\n"

    could happen if you're allowing FontLab to recalculate some OS/2 and hhea values,
    such as TypoAscender/Ascender etc.\r\n\r\n> <em>and where do i fix this?</em>\r\n\r\nUsing
    FontLab's \"Metrics and Dimensions\" --> \"TrueType-specific metrics\" panel,
    make sure you're using the same values as the previous version of the font.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    you can get those values from the older font with [[TTX]], and change them in
    the new font, using [[TTX]] as well.\r\nThe values you're looking for are in the
    tables 'OS/2' and 'hhea', so you can use this command to get them:\r\n\r\n<code>ttx
    -t OS/2 -t hhea MyOldFont.otf</code>\r\n\r\nThen you'll just have to edit the
    .ttx file that got output (MyOldFont.ttx), and integrate that file with the new
    font by typing:\r\n\r\n<code>ttx -b -m MyNewFont.otf MyOldFont.ttx</code>"

    panel to match the font info from MyOldFont to MyNewFont, but the problem still
    seems to occur.\r\n\r\nAs part of the debugging process I opened MyOldFont and
    regenerated it \r\n- opened the .pfb version in Fontlab - made no changes - selected
    the use custom values in the metrics and dimensions palette - and republished
    the font. Still getting larger leading than the original version.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas?\r\n\r\n-J"
