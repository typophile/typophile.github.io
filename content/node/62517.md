body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nPlease forgive my newbiness. First time posting here, and I'm
  only starting to learn my way around typography. When they found out I knew a little
  about graphic design, a statewide historical magazine asked me to take over their
  layout and design duties. It's been great, but I completely jumped in over my head.
  Previously, the headline fonts were a mishmash. But we've started using Optima for
  headlines and everyone seems pretty happy with it. However, we're still using 10
  pt Times New Roman for body text. I don't have anything personal against Times.
  But I'd like to present the editor with some other options. One post mentioned Melior.
  Anyone have additional ideas for a highly-readable typeface? As for the font's feel,
  we're trying to go a bit more upscale. The accompanying graphics I'm using will
  run the gamut from distressed calligraphic backgrounds to fairly sleek vector images.
  One usability consideration is I THINK many of our readers are slightly older. Say
  40s+. So I don't want to interfere with legibility at all. We haven't been doing
  many fancy things with the body text. So we can live with only regular, bold, and
  italic options.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts you might have would be very appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nBrian"

    Sans</a> would make a good companion maybe.

  body: I wouldn't pair a sans with a sans. The safe and obvious choice is Palatino
    (serif), probably in its Nova form. Still a Zapf type, but one that would look
    great set a bit large (and that's what you'd want with your readership), is <a

  body: Continuing on the Zapf/Palatino theme, you will want to take the general page
    design into account. Palatino is pretty wide, and if you are using a 1-column
    layout that will be an advantage. On the other hand, if you use a 2-column layout,
    it may be too wide, in which case you might take a look at Aldus, which is the
    "book" version of Palatino (similar appearance but more traditional text-face
    proportions).

  body: Thanks for the suggestions submitted so far! Yes, most of the magazine is
    laid out 2-column, with one or two articles in 3-column format. I'll work up some
    samples for the editor in all the fonts mentioned above and see what she says.
    I just know we can find something more interesting than Times.
