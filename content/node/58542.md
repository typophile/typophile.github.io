  body: "I don't know how far you want to stray from Helvetica. You might want to
    try Univers 45 Light, Akzidenz Grotesk Light, Avenir 35 Light, Avant Garde, Franklin
    Gothic Book. Some of these are not so close to Helvetica, but looking at your
    site, I think any of these choices could work on some level.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Not sure if that's an issue.
