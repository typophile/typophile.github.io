		<div class="commentbody">I have recently been reading and looking at Albertina in 'Book Typography' by Mitchell & Wightman. It is impressive indeed. 

I've never warmed to Frutiger's serif faces, but I'd be very interested to see Breughel in use, as it is interesting the way it handles weight. Can you point us to any examples, Carl?

I find Trinité just awesome to look at on the TEFF site, but I've never seen it in extended use. I assumed it was because it is so expensive. Charles, what do you think needs fixing in it? 

I would add Whitman to the list. I think it is awesome. I personally haven't seen it in use, though I gather it is pretty widely used.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I bought Trinité when the exchange rate of the euro was 85-cents. I guess it is more expensive for those of us in the States now. But you get a bunch of fonts, and for the Type-1 days, they were pretty complete. Anyway, I bought Trinité because Richard Eckersley wanted to use it, and when Richard began using a font, you knew he would use it for years. A good investment.

It comes with no ligatures, and no kerning. And yes, it does need an f_i and f_f_i ligature. Even the old trick of setting the dotless "i" following an "f" doesn't quite work. I doubt it is available in OpenType, but it also needs a terminal f. An f-space kern won't cut it.

Back to money for a bit. If a set of fonts costs $1,000 and you use it for 10 books, that's cheap, given the "new book, new fonts" approach of too many designers. And by the way, for my money, it takes designers a while to understand how to use a font, and comps a while to learn how to set it -- but then, I'm a dinosaur.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My list of underused/underexposed types includes:

<a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/" target=new>Cycles</a> -- Surprisingly, someone did use Cycles for the logo of Cymbalta, an antidepressant medication being advertised widely these days. But I haven't run across it many other places. I used the original release in a book several years ago and loved it. (I only wish we'd printed on a slightly softer paper.) Charles, most of the cuts in the family I have include OsF. In which size(s) are you missing them? 

<a href="http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Documenta_rdrct.html" target=new>DTL Documenta</a> -- I've only seen it once or twice here in the States.

<a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=171&subpage=viewfonts" target=new>Paperback</a> -- I'm surprised this hasn't been picked up on more. I found it a little dark for a book I tried it with, but I would have thought I'd see this more in advertising. I should think it's quirks would be perfect for the zeitgeist.

<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/iowan-old-style/" target=new>Iowan Old Style</a> -- Another John Downer design. This used to be a workhorse and fallback for me. But I haven't seen it used much elsewhere.

<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.6180.0.0" target=new>FF Quadraat</a> -- I used to see this a little more, but it disappeared pretty quickly. I still love it's look. The one quibble I have is that there aren't kerning pairs for quotation marks with periods and commas in any combination. And so, it was a little unfortunate that Quadraat was used in the American edition of <cite>Eats, Shoots & Leaves</cite> -- a book about punctuation, of all things -- and the lack of kerns didn't get addressed, which meant that there were all sorts of distracting gaps around the many quotation marks.

Thanks for the mention. I'm hoping <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman" target=new>Whitman</a> will garner more use once I can complete the Bold Italic, which many people have been clamoring for. It's on the docket, but first FB wants me to finish the Display family for the Retail library -- seven weights in three widths.

Right now, the most visible place to see Whitman in use is probably <cite>BRIDES</cite> magazine. The magazine is mostly Cyrus's <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Relay" target=new>Relay</a>. (Heck, the magazine is mostly ads!) But there's some Whitman in there, if you can find the hard content. They also have a few cuts from the original Display commission, which they mix in.

William, Isn't that the very problem? The only two places I've ever seen Breughel are in the issue of Fine Print where Chuck Bigelow wrote about Frutiger's serifed faces (there are more than you might think) and in a book called "Typefaces for Books" by James Sutton and Alan Bartram. It is a useful specimen of many book faces that were available when it came out, because it shows several sizes of text with variations in leading. 

Brueghel might be newly interesting in light of the current slab-serif trend. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, I read a lot of Quadraat every other week in the <em>London Review of Books,</em> and the long arm of the "f" frequently distracts me, as it often jumps across word spaces and collides with a following capital -- a frequent occurence in book titles. Nonetheless, it's a great face which I really enjoy reading, but I'm glad I rarely come across it outside the LRB.

Certainly, some faces are overused, but the issue is not that there are great type designs particularly scorned and overlooked in relation to their merit. I'd say that art directors should go out of their way to choose special typefaces, and make every publication as unique as possible. After all, there are gazillions of typefaces available, and, by astute typography, many more may be massaged into respectability than just adopting the aficionados' favourites. </div>

Yes, Quadraat is one of many typefaces that need a terminal f (f.terminal) set up in a contextual alternate so the terminal "f" is used when a word space follows. You both shorten the arm of the "f" a bit, and increase the right sidebearing. Of course, you can't do this with Quadraat ;) -- because it is a FontFont font, & they forbid the end user from fixing all their errors.</div>

For instance, reassembling LF into the regular Kievit fonts and deriving fractions for a cookbook I was working on. Obviously, we had to have a proper license and we kept the fonts in-house.

<cite> It comes with no ligatures, and no kerning. And yes, it does need an f_i and f_f_i ligature. Even the old trick of setting the dotless “i” following an “f” doesn’t quite work. I doubt it is available in OpenType, but it also needs a terminal f. An f-space kern won’t cut it.. </cite>

I have been working a lot with the <cite>Trinité</cite>. Until now, I have encountered but a very few typefaces, which have the same quality. Its lacking of kerning is not a disadvantage, but a proof of craftmanship. Having worked for The Enschedé Font Foundry in the recent past, I know kerning the <cite>Trinité</cite> would be a diffilcult job and it would be somewhere a contradiction to the typeface.
Although I like ligatures a lot, I also find the use anoying. If you change the tracking in any way, they become obsolete.

		<div class="commentbody">Jacques,

In a lot of ways, I agree with you. One of the virtues of Trinité is that it looks quite good when set by application programs that do not support kerning or ligaturing. It is a masterful execution from that perspective. But I bought the fonts to set some books for Richard Eckersley, who also owned the fonts & set some books himself. If you knew him, you know he was not satisfied with less than what <cite>could</cite> be done, and I don't think anyone would disagree that the fonts can be improved with kerning and ligatures 

Somewhere in all my email correspondence with Peter Noordzij, he mentioned that if I kerned it, he would like to see the result. I guess I haven't followed up on that. And I think he mentioned once that de Does had changed his mind about the need for ligatures.

I don't think a properly set up font (which Trinité is) should be tracked. But if you must track it, you can always break the ligaturing.

The crack about the EULA concerns the price: I asked Peter Noordzij about the extra cost for allowing full embedding of the fonts in a PDF file, which some publishers require. His response was that the number of people (computers) then involved was the whole world, and of course, that price would be astronomical – at the time I bought it, 2,000 computers would have been about 76,000 euros.

So for the numerous academic publishers that have a contract with NetLibrary, which <cite>requires</cite> a PDF with full embedding, Trinité should not be used.

Best,

Charles</div>

Don't get me started! You were lucky! I asked for permission to place the f ligs in the regular font so that they would function properly in InDesign, and was told that the work had to be done by FontShop at a cost of, if I recall correctly, $25 per lig...and they asked what position I wanted the  character should be placed in, which indicated to me that the person doing the work didn't understand how to properly encoded f ligs for InDesign.

Fortunately for me, after some discussion it was agreed that I had licensed the font under an earlier EULA that did allow mods.</div>

thank you for your elaborate reply. Now I know of the context you were speaking of, I can imagine the lack of tracking is/was an important issue.

PM Noordzij and I have had lots of discussions on this theme. They often ended it up in discussing the way typographer, fontdesigners and graphic designers differ in approach when setting text and the making of books.

http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/6553-sample.pdf

Edit:

BTW, Peter Noordzij was pretty accommodating about a slight change to the license, so I drew up ligatures & kerned the font. You have to magnify the sample, but they are there.

And I still think Trinité  is worth the price. I don't get to use it much these days, because for any title, publishers hold out hope there may be a PDF ebook. At the price, they won't buy it. My feeling is you get a fair bit for that $1,000 Euros -- or whatever it's gone to these days.

Second edit:

If anyone cares, these are Richard's specifications:

http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/6553-specs.pdf

Can't remember if Richard was using an 18-unit em in those days, or the 54-unit one. Probably 18. Always had to "translate" his letterspacing instructions...</div>

Off topic: I remain to be convinced. Maybe in future, but right now as a Mac user interested in seeing what they're doing...the website is a joke. All fonts are shown with text samples in [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=28|Cyrillic and Greek first]] even though I'm looking at an English-language webpage! And I can [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/default.aspx|only find a list of fonts]] on Windows 8, not 8.1. Did extra new stuff arrive with 8.1? Who knows? There's [[http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=sitka+site%3Awww.microsoft.com%2Ftypography&oq=sitka+site%3Awww.microsoft.com%2Ftypography&aqs=chrome..69i57.5383j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8|nothing]] on the website explaining Sitka or how I could use its optical sizes as a consumer, either. (There's [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688099.aspx|a bit]] explaining it for developers.) Was it worth commissioning a huge MM font family if nothing but IE can safely use it? Or can other applications safely use it? Is it worth the hassle for me to update to Windows 8.1 if I'm a Windows 7 user to get it? Why does [[http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2800393|Office 2013]] seem to come with far fewer fonts than [[http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2121313|Office 2010]]? What happens if I reinstall Windows and never install Office 2010, do my documents suddenly stop being in Garamond and start being in Calibri? Who knows? 

The big giveaway is that when you go to the [[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Typography/aboutfontsoverview.aspx|'overview']] page on fonts, it points you to an exciting list of new fonts that come with Windows 7. Check the 'last updated' date for yourself, nobody's touched it in half a decade. 

And Sitka is just one font. The [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/product.aspx?PID=164|Windows bundled font library]] has always been a bit rubbish, but it's really rubbish now. Meanwhile, buying a cheap Mac is effectively buying a decent starter font library and a [[http://www.apple.com/uk/mac/pages/|basic DTP app]] with a computer thrown in for free. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Many good questions, and good points. I guess in a huge corporation it's hard to be consistent, especially concerning something that many people sadly don't think is too relevant; we see that at Adobe too, with the maddening differences in the ways menus etc. are presented, and even OT support.

But it remains that MS commissioned the Core Fonts, then the ClearType fonts, and now Sitka, plus they've been much more serious and sober about non-Latin support. In contrast, until the glimmer of hope presented by the new San Francisco, it really has been the typographic dark ages at Apple for many years now. A Comic Sans clone, really? But let's hope this new change is real and long-lived.

		<div class="commentbody">I thought Apple's "Comic Sans clone" was instead a clearly different and better typeface... but provided as a Comic Sans substitute, because, after all, Mac users want to look at the same Internet as PC users, and there are a lot of web pages out there which just assume everyone has the standard PC typefaces.

So I didn't see that Apple had a <em>choice</em>, it just made the best of a bad situation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This reminds me. I don't think that Linux includes an open-source substitute for Comic Sans, even though it did aim at providing equivalents of Times Roman and Arial/Helvetica. (I know they aren't the same typeface, but just as Arial was Monotype Grotesque with Helvetica metrics, intended as a substitute for Helvetica, clones of Helvetica can serve as a substitute for Arial when rendering web pages "intended" to display in Arial.)

But I could be mistaken. If so, what is their answer to Chalkboard?

Ah, a search happened to turn up an answer; they could use [[https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/font/|Balsamiq Sans]] if they wish.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Using an original Comic Sans is possible on Linux as shown by the Core Fonts project over on Sourceforge ([[http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/]]). MS’s EULA allowed redistribution of the unmodified files which the Core Fonts project did by distributing the original self-extracting cabinets and using <code>cabextract</code> to get at the contents.

Sure, Comic Sans isn’t Open Source, but I’m not rabid enough to blow my top.</div>
