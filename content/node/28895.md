  than I are aware of [[Iakov Chernikhov]]. I only just found out about him when a
  colleague forwarded me <a href="http://www.icif.ru/Engl/index.htm">Iakov Chernikhov
  International Foundation (ICIF)</a>. There''s a nice <a href="http://www.icif.ru/Engl/about.htm">biography</a>,
  but the thing that really caught my eye was this: <a href="http://www.icif.ru/Engl/cyc/font/index.htm#1">Construction
  of the Classic Type</a>. That and the awesomely awesome architectural drawings and
  other graphics.'
