body: I would like to experiment with font design. I trust there are many programs
  ranging in cost and sophistication. I would be grateful for any general thoughts
  on what I should consider when scouting out these programs.

  body: "I'm sure others will give you more useful details and opinions. I'll just
    start with the mainstream answer:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/\r\n\r\nAs you'll
    see, the company produces several different font design programs of different
    levels of sophistication (and price).\r\n\r\nThere are also free programs and
    websites you might want to try before you go spending any money, but I'll let
    someone who's used them comment on those."

  body: Thanks Joshua. I would surmise that the two most important features that would
    distinguish one program from another are the variety of available curve species,
    and the ability to have a qualitative change on one character be rendered to all
    of them. Is this correct?

  body: "I am not a type designer, which is why I was reluctant to say too much about
    any of this. I just use fonts that other people make.\r\n\r\nBut even the most
    basic program (like TypeTool, which I've used for very simple things) shouldn't
    place any constrains on the curves you can draw. If you've ever used the \"pen\"
    tool to draw vectors in Illustrator, etc., that's essentially how all type design
    programs work, though with some differences. The more expensive programs may have
    features for doing batch adjustments of various kinds, but I'll leave that to
    someone who knows what they're talking about."
