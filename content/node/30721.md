body: "Hello! Thank you for reading this post. \r\n\r\nI have heard plenty of opinions
  on what font editing software is most effective, most professionally utilized, price
  comparisons, easy to use or learn and other things that distinguish one program
  from the next. \r\n\r\nBut what should a good font design program actually offer?
  If you ignore the name, the price, even perhaps ease of use of any given program
  on the market: What should the program have? \r\n\r\nPlease list the options, the
  price points and such.  I am curious as to what functionality of a program makes
  it superior to the next.  Please answer this as if you were addressing the average
  computer user (not a typography expert like yourself, you smart devil)."

  body: "Interesting question, but seems a little bit pointless? You basically have
    four options if you want to use font editing/creation software that's being actively
    developed... \r\n\r\n1. Commercial product\r\n2. Cut down cheaper version of commercial
    product\r\n3. Open Source product\r\n4. Cheap 'shareware' product by nice bloke
    in Holland\r\n\r\nConveniently it really just comes down to price and philosophy
    - something for everyone.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey Si!- I have read many of your other answers in this forum, I am learning
    a lot from you. Which I owe you many thanks. Keep up the great posts!\r\n\r\nNow
    to business.\r\n\r\nVery true what you said. \r\n\r\nBut what I am hearing is
    mostly personal preferrence with no actual information backing it. When a person
    is trying to learn what makes things tick, its difficult to understand the mechanicks
    when people say \"This one is great, this is what you need\".\r\n\r\nOne person
    said they absolutely love Type Tool.\r\nMany say Fontlab because it is the standard.\r\nFierce
    brand loyalists are behind Fontographer.\r\nAnd others like the stuff they find
    on shareware sites.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Is it because one is updated more often? Because
    one is only in their price range? Because they were originally trained on it and
    don't want to change? Or is Fontlab truly mind blowing etc.\r\n\r\nThe question
    is not pointless if one wants to go deeper than merely brand or price. What makes
    a program tick?\r\n\r\nI watched a lot of hype over products and brands in college.
    What a better place to learn from the experts asking you guys!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\r\nSorry, your question wasn't really pointless. \r\n\r\nI'm sure other
    people will give your more helpful answers - the point was really that in this
    space you're not exactly spoilt for choice. \r\n\r\nThe answer also depends on
    what you want to make, and what you want to learn. If you're just interested in
    making a few basic fonts then FCP or Typetool may be totally fine - if you're
    looking to make OpenType fonts then making the jump straight to FontLab may be
    a better bet. With respect to FOG, although people still love it, and many designer
    still use it to start a design, I think all the signs point to FontLab not investing
    in it long-term. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "From the question, I surmise you have not done a course. As a poorly self
    taught person, my answer would be as follows\r\n\r\nEveryone works in a different
    way, and as such should use the program which that person finds easiest to use,
    and understand. Fontographer to me is easiest to create with, but Fontlab is best
    for me to do the finicky fine work with. So I use both. Other more professional
    people would, in general, suggest you use Fontlab, as they know all the ins and
    outs through training and experience. \r\nSo what you need to do is try the programs
    and determine which is easiest for you to get the desired outcome. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you have a lot of money and are doing full-time font development, particularly
    in a team setting, there's also DTL FontMaster.\r\n\r\nBut for most other folks
    doing serious work, if you are only buying one tool, FontLab is the only option
    worth considering.\r\n\r\nFontographer simply lacks key features that we need
    for serious work (such as OpenType support, decent Unicode support, native TrueType
    editing, adequate hinting for both kinds of outlines, and a zillion aspects of
    control over what goes into the generated font). It does have a drawing interface
    that a lot of people like, however.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    the cold hard stuff that tells me what to look at.\r\n\r\nI have a B.A. in art
    from a fabulous and prestigious liberal arts college....It just so happens that
    it wasn't so fab in the art department though. There were no Typography courses
    and such- my design classes didn't even get into it. But discussing the various
    avenues of formal art and design education is not what this post is for. What's
    done is done and I am working hard now. The point is moot and I am happy with
    it all- just doign a little overtime in the self education thing right now.\r\n\r\nI
    am an Adobe addict so I comprehend when people say that a program has a tough
    learning curve. I also understand budget concerns and hobbyists vs. professionals.
    \ \r\n\r\nI want to get into font design (I drool over them honestly...). I don't
    have the budget right now to invest in Fontlab but I am going to be designing
    three logos in the comming weeks and thusly I am beefing up my knowledge on everything
    I can. \r\n\r\nI understand when some will surely say \"If you are serious about
    this you will find a way to purchase Fontlab...\". I agree with them. Unfortunately,
    my bank account doesn't and that is the reality that I have to face.\r\n\r\nSo
    in the mean time, I want to learn about the options and see what makes them tick.
    \r\n\r\nSo what it comes down to is this. Fontlab is worth it- but I can't afford
    it right now. So can I do everything that I will need to do (and learn mind you...newbie
    newbie at font work) on Type Tool? Can I save the font in all the formats I need
    to? \r\n\r\nI don't even know what to ask...get the picture? I am in that land
    of I know enough to know I don't know anything. Which is a good thing, since I
    am here putting forth effort. :)\r\n"
