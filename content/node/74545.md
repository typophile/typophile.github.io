  has suggested I engage the topic of typography, in the attempts to tailor the assignment
  to my interests and educational goals.\r\n\r\nI am having trouble coming up with
  a clear grasp of what I'm going to do. I'm finding it difficult to pin down the
  concept of 'Old Western typography.' I am focusing primarily on the entire 19th
  century. Was there even a difference between typography used on the east coast vs.
  the western frontiers? There's the Gothic Tuscan style that one often associates
  with posters of the 'Wild West,' but were those same faces not also used on the
  east coast?\r\n\r\nI'm just looking for a little direction here. The goal for this
  project is to come up with some original research on typography as it relates to
  the American West (or the idea of the West) .\r\n\r\nI have checked out Rob Roy
  Kelly's American Wood Type, 1828\u20131900 from the library, as well as Philip Meggs'
  History of Graphic Design. Not sure where else to look, but then, I'm also not exactly
  sure what I'm looking for :/\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "eliason, yes, and I thank you for your reply. Unfortunately that thread doesn't
    really answer some of my core questions, that is, is there even such a thing as
    'Old Western' typography? Is the idea an idealized fabrication? Was the style
    we most commonly associate with 'Old West' or 'Wild West' also used on the east
    coast, making the distinction moot?\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Thank you for
    your reply."

  body: "<cite>Is the idea an idealized fabrication?</cite>\r\n\r\nAlmost everything
    about the Wild West is a fabrication. Particularly the wild typography\u2014if
    most of those farm hands and cattle ranchers had been literate they\u2019d have
    been able to land good jobs in the East and not gone out there to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe
    same types were sold from coast to coast, with type, or at least matrices, shipped
    from foundries to other dealers or foundries all over the country. And of course
    they knocked each other off like crazy. Printers in the southwest would have had
    a smaller selection to work from due to being remote and having limited financial
    means. It\u2019s not likely that many had enough types to set the wild broadsides
    we associate with the period, much less big presses for working with big wood
    type. Some of them had a few fonts of wood type for posters, but nothing too fancy
    (no point ordering fad type on a frontier budget) and often they were of poor
    quality and hand-carved.\r\n\r\nAs for the wild tuscan styles, that\u2019s mostly
    east coast stuff. A good deal originated at William Hamilton Page\u2019s firm,
    probably inspired by the lettering on lithographed advertising posters. It would
    be interesting to see if the wild west typography styles originated in advertising
    for Wild West shows and dime novels sold in East Coast cities and London"
