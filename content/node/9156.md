body: I&#39;ve looked through the Font Lab manual and didn&#39;t find a similar function
  as Copy Reference in Fontographer. If a similar option is available in Font Lab
  what is it called? Thanks <BR> <BR>tim

  body: 'The Copy Reference &#40;I hope I got the name right&#41; creates a copy of
    an existing glyph. For example: &uuml;. In Fontographer you can select the lc
    u &#40;that has already been created&#41; and use the Copy Reference command which
    will paste your u to &uuml;. <BR> <BR>If you changed the shape of your lc u glyph,
    any Copy References you made with the lc u, such as &uuml;, would be changed.
    <BR> <BR>I wish I could explain this process a little bit clearer. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: The command you want is Add Component &#40;Option-F9 on Mac OS X&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Go first to the glyph cell where you want the reference to be. Hit Opt-F9,
    and a dialog will pop up asking you to specify the name of the glyph that you
    want to reference. This is great, because there is a preview of each glyph and
    a list of available glyphs that narrows down as you type more characters. Very
    very handy. <BR> <BR>Also nice is the ability to - once the component is placed
    - change its source. Select the component, and go Edit -&#62; Properties. You
    can then select what character is referenced, and numerically fudge with the component&#39;s
    position. <BR> <BR>Nicer still, right-click the component and choose &#34;Edit
    Component&#34;; this will pop up a new glyph window with the source character
    loaded. <BR> <BR>Alan

  body: Another nice feature is the ability to copy and paste composite glyphs within
    a font leaving the composites intact. This is handy if you need to make a pile
    of composites using the same base glyph, e.g. agrave aacute acircumflex adieresis
    etc. You can make one, copy it to the other cells, and then only need to replace
    one component in each composite. If you&#39;ve correctly spaced your diacritic
    marks, you won&#39;t even need to adjust any positioning. <BR> <BR>Note that you
    can&#39;t copy and paste a composite from one font to another without it decomposing.
    However, if you copy the composite <i>and</i> the base characters for its components,
    you can use the Append function to copy them to another font <i>preserving the
    composites.</i> [FontLab will also attempt to preserve visual TT hinting when
    you use the Append function to copy glyphs from one font to another. This works
    extremely well if you have identical CVT values &#40;alignment zones, stem controls&#41;
    in both fonts.] <BR> <BR>Dang, FontLab is brilliant!

  body: Alan, does FL copy the spacing and kerning metrics data with it as well to
    the new composite character? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Amen, John, FontLab r0x0rs!! To add to your comments, you can also use the
    &#34;Generate Glyphs&#34; command to build accented characters. Just type the
    name of the glyphs you wish to create &#40;agrave aacute ... &#41; and the glyphs
    are automatically created, and the accents positioned overhead. Tweaking is often
    needed, but it&#39;s such a great start. &#40;This was covered very nicely by
    Adam Twardoch in the FL forums, iirc.&#41; <BR> <BR>Stuart, I think if the glyph
    cell is empty, the width of the first component added is applied to the new glyph.
    As for metrics, you can use FontLab&#39;s collections/classes features to add
    any newly created accented characters to an existing glyph class. Kerning data
    can be tied to one &#34;master&#34; character in a class, and applied across the
    rest of the members of that class automatically. It&#39;s like Fog&#39;s kerning
    assistance, only way way way better. <BR> <BR>Alan

    folder, which contains the references from glyph name to components, e.g. <BR>
    <BR>Adieresis\tA&#43;dieresis <BR> <BR> <BR>My alias.dat file even does Vietnamese
