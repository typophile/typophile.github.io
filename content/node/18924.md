    be more fun to guess?

    parking in their spot.\r\nSo they went with blackletter, bible, etc.\r\nIt seemed
    to be handlettered."

    you been there lately? The last time I was there I walked into a sword shop and
    in the back was a counter selling Nazi memorabilia. I was with a friend who's
    from San Diego but has lived in Berlin for the last 12 years and he was horrified.
    He told me he would be arrested if he showed up with any of that crap.\r\n\r\nI
    was also with my girlfriend who lived in Prenzlaurberg from 1995-2001. They both
    felt right at home.\r\n\r\nNow the Red Lion on Glendale is another story\u2026\r\nGreat
    Bier und Wurst\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"

    now so with your fashionable headgear you would fit right in. They have the best
    German food I know of anywhere near and they have a lot of German beer on tap.
    I like it there. It's comfortable.\r\n\r\nThey also have really cheesy lounge
    musicians in the downstairs part at night if you're into that sort of thing. I'm
    not.\r\n\r\nGlendale just south of where Silver Lake Blvd. intersects on the east
    side of the street\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"
