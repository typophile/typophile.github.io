		<div class="commentbody">What wonderful feedback! Alright&hellip; <BR> <BR>- I'd increase the word space.  <BR>Yes, it was very needed. <BR> <BR>- Some of the sidebearings (like the Dalet's left) should be zero.  <BR>I don't agree. The terribly small size of the letters makes spacing crucial. Zeroing a sidebearing on any of the letters (I've tried numerous tracking combinations) yields very odd implications. Kerning would be super if I could get it to work&hellip; Haven't mastered that field technically, I'm afraid. <BR> <BR>- I like your vertical proportions, I just wonder if it wouldn't be better to give the Lamed a 2-pixel ascender.  <BR>You're right on. I hate making Lamed &quot;ascenders&quot; (in Hebrew we call them &quot;poles&quot;) too short, it just isn't natural. Look at this caricature from an old Hebrew calligraphy/typography teaching book: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28580.gif" alt="Cutting off Lamed&#39;s pole"> <BR> <BR>- Widths: I think it's better too wide than too narrow, I just wonder if width variance can't be used to diverge the confusable letters even more, like in the Bet versus Kaf. <BR>True, but that is not my main concern about these wider letters. I'm more troubled by the notion it makes the eye linger on them, trying to decode these odd shapes' meanings. I'd hate having to part with this incredible addition to my font. <BR> <BR>- Alef: what about making the top-right arm shorter (coming out from higher up in the diagonal)? That would reduce the distracting symmetry.  <BR>I've made it assymetrical now, correspondant with the Tzadi, which I believe is a letter meant to be similar to the Alef. <BR> <BR>- I really like the bravery of the Gimel.  <BR>Thank you! It stayed that way from the 2000 version. <BR> <BR>- The wobble in the Zayin is valuable, but it's too jittery in small bitmaps - I'd try not bringing the down stroke back to the right after the left shift. So basically a flipped Vav (shorter by a pixel) with a flat top added.  <BR>Shifted the upper pixel back. I don't like the idea of Zayin being too narrow, I want more-or-less similar widths for the letters, because I believe it improves readability. <BR> <BR>- I wonder if the Yod needs to be stronger.  <BR>I've widened the Yod, Vav and Nun-Sofit. <BR> <BR>- What about giving the (non-final) Mem an ascending pixel? <BR>That wouldn't be very wise, an ascending pixel would make it seem bigger than the other letters. I've taken off a pixel from the bottom, to emphasize its Mem-ity :&gt; <BR> <BR>- What can you do to make the Nun less like the Kaf?  <BR>I've added a pixel on the bottom right edge. <BR> <BR>- What about giving the Samekh an extra leftward pixel on top? <BR>Nah, I don't want the letters to be too square. <BR> <BR>- Smart divergence between the Qof and the He.  <BR>Thanks! This has also been in the 2000 version. <BR> <BR>- The final-Mem is too square. Hey, it is a square! What about curling in the left stem at the very top? <BR>Oops! Got me there. Here, it's fixed now. <BR> <BR>Again, thank you so much for your incredible feeback! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28581.gif" alt="Concept&#44; 3rd time around"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Kerning would be super if I could get it to work&hellip; <BR> <BR>Well, maybe you're right about the zero sidebearings considering kerning is not always available, but why are you having trouble with kerning? <BR> <BR>&gt; I'm more troubled by the notion it makes the <BR>&gt; eye linger on them, trying to decode these <BR>&gt; odd shapes' meanings. <BR> <BR>Actually, you're right: at this size legibility is more important than readability. (See below.) <BR> <BR>BTW, are they really &quot;odd&quot;? <BR>Are they odd because of a conscious attempt by you or because of the lo-res? <BR> <BR>&gt; I want more-or-less similar widths for the letters, because I believe it improves readability.  <BR> <BR>Actually, width divergence is a big factor is readability (as long as no glyph is <i>too</i> narrow). BUT, legibility (different than readability) does benefit from &quot;raw&quot; size (= width), so I think a wide Zayin is smart, especially in the context of the Vav. BTW, I think the old Vev (and the old final-Nun) were better (more divergent from similars). <BR> <BR>You know what? The confusing network in Hebrew is very strong and very pervasive. <BR>I need to make a diagram, like the one I've done for Latin: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&amp;s.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&amp;amp;s.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&amp;amp;s.gif</a></a> <BR> <BR>What would be really nice though is some linguistic data - like at least letter frequencies, or in this case ideally a (long) list of the most frequent Hebrew words. That would help seeing which letters are most confusable in actual text, not just in a structural vacuum. I think John has some info like this, no? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Is there a rational to it? <BR>in a thinner pei with dagesh you can make the pei not enter the the space inside. that way the dagesh wont connect to the pei's body. <BR> <BR>I really like the alef. its extremly nice. the whole font has a good feeling to it, like the old concept font. <BR> <BR>Maybe the old zayin was better. consider its aesthetic value. <BR> <BR>I feel we stumble into the same problems in hebrew screen fonts. for example, the mem looks very much like the het. if you drop that pixel at the bottom of the mem you'll be left with a het. the subtle differance is also present in taf and het, tet and samech, and by some extension of the phenomena its also present in- bet and kaf &amp; resh and dalet. <BR>do you find this one-pixel diffrence as disturbing as i do? *sigh* i think its a major problem. <BR>i tryed solving it by making all letters wider and more 'detailed'. i sort of droped the idea of having a mem without some sort of oketz, or a nice circle-shaped samech, etc'. well, you saw Kyoto. its not so much a solution to this legibility problem as an escape from it. <BR> <BR>(argh.. meir, your english is good<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

The base matrix for this font is 5x5 pixels, meaning 25 pixels give an overhaul 100% for a single, average letter. Altering one pixel would affect 4% of the entire composition - that is a lot! And when we're talking about its perimeter, that's almost 6%, and when we're talking about a single edge, well, now we're at 20%! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28650.gif" alt="The font matrix"> <BR> <BR>Oh, and also referring Hrant's question about making it bolder - I wouldn't dare making this specific font bolder, but when it comes to making heavy-weight Hebrew fonts, I either strengthen its horizontal strokes, or make both horizontal and vertical strokes bolder. I avoid strengthening only the vertical lines because it gives Hebrew letters a very fragile look.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Backslanting Hebrew type is quite common lately in Hebrew fonts, perhaps it's so because of the inverse directionality of the language. In any case, slanted/oblique/italic Hebrew fonts are pretty rare in general because there is no true Hebrew &quot;italic&quot;. In an early <a href="http://www.shunammite.com/type.html">David Hebrew</a> release (by the late designer Ismar David), an &quot;Italic&quot; style has been suggested, and as you can see it slants to the left, maybe in order to be more compatible with Latin texts (in the link you can also see its beautiful and unreleased &quot;Sans&quot; style I'm currently studying). <BR> <BR>It is well known that Hebrew letters lack divergence and therefore Hebrew text suffers great readability issues. There have been some <a href="http://www.fontbit.co.il/Stigma.html">quite bizzare experimentations</a> lately but I still haven't seen a better adaptation of the &quot;cursive&quot; style than the example I showed in my previous post.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There seems to be much debate about the direction of italic in Hebrew. I had a discussion a few years back with Tzvika Rosenberg on the subject.</p>
<p>David seems to be the only classic font with a true italic and in this case the italic was forward. However, it is my opinion that a Hebrew italic should be backwards in the same direction as its Latin counterpart for the simple reason that Hebrew cursive script (handwriting) is always written in that direction. If italic fonts are supposed to mimic handwriting, then it only makes sense that this should be the direction of the font.</p>
<p>Tzvika likes to call italics that are in the direction of English fonts, &ldquo;italic&rdquo; and italics that are forward moving (like in David Italic aka MF Ramot in the Masterfont library) oblique. I personally think that this is an incorrect definition, but the debate will no doubt continue.</p>
<p>Fontbit has just released a new text font with real italics called ktifa, which has italics in both directions in order to keep both camps happy I guess!</p>
