  body: "It looks like the Super weight.\r\n\r\nWeingart once told me the story of
    finding Job Cases of Akzidenz in a dust print lab in Basel. In those days, Ruder
    was his teacher and used mostly Univers. The trasure trove of lead type in AG
    made Weingart jump for joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'the other type on this poster looks like AG but the part that I am confused
    by is the numbers the word "KUNST". They have a much more rounded and bulbous
    shape than AG which is what i''m looking for. '

    out a million times by those much better than me, and have had but one success,
    you at least want that one paltry victory to be noted by the Belgian Master :-)
    \r\nGlad you are home safe, dude!\r\n\r\nChrisL"
