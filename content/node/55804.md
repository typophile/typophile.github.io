  on vacation.\r\n\r\nIt's just a modified helvetica bold oblique (although my mock
  is in myriad), with a couple of cheesy \"speed\" angles coming off it. Just the
  sort of thing you'd get from a cheap signage shop. \r\n\r\nThere are many similar
  faces out there on free-fonts sites, but they're all much busier. This one really
  is as simple as it looks. Just basic, clean, and tacky."

  body: "Well, you have only showed a mock of what you saw. Do you want suggestions
    for other 'speedy' lettering in the hopes it will match the original 'cheap signage'?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou
    said you have searched the freebies, so maybe it's possible what you saw is a
    commercial font, like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/slipstream/|Slipstream]].\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks for helping. I know a fair amount about type but have been unable
    to track down this exact face; the mock is very faithful to the original. People
    here seem quite good at IDing, so I'd hoped it might make an enjoyable challenge
    for the best among you.\r\n\r\nI've searched commercial sites and free alike and
    had encountered Slipstream. Unlike Slipstream, which I know is derived from Futura,
    the one I saw is definitely just a modified Helvetica bold. I called it a 'cheap
    signage' font because I honestly doubt that serious typographers are likely to
    use it often. \r\n\r\nNevertheless I admired how clean it was. Unlike Slipstream
    and others, it doesn't try to create the effect of a gradient. The protrusions
    really are as simple as they appear in the mock, although they might vary slightly
    in number or placement. The mock is very faithful, athough I did use Myriad for
    it ;-)"

  body: "The mock really does look almost exactly like the original. Wind, like the
    others, is part of the same family but not a match. Thank you, though. \r\n\r\nI
    also doubt it was custom work; it was for a sign that just said \"DRIVE THRU,\"
    not for a logo; I doubt a small business in the country would go to that much
    effort. \r\n\r\nI might have to track down the place where I saw it. That should
    be tough but it might be doable. Thanks again to both of you for trying to help."

  body: "If your sense is that they wouldn't go to the trouble to customize their
    own sign, then they might also be too cheap to license a font for doing it, so
    the freebie world is the likely source. in that case, good luck, because there
    are millions of 'em. Your best shot would be to find them again and ask what they
    used.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
