    but now I think Manfred has released it as freeware/shareware. I think it's at
    TypOasis under his designer page there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: That was definitely the font.  Gee, you started collecting fonts in 93...
    what a year!  I think Mosaic was the web browser of choice that year. That's when
    I started learning the HTML realm. Thanks again for the assistance!

  body: "<em>\"93... what a year!\",</em>\r\n\r\nIndeed. Back when there weren't over
    100,000 fonts to try to learn. (I didn't even have e-mail until late 1994, and
    I think it was years before I started learning about the web.)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    glad to help out.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
