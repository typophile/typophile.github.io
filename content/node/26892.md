body: Does anyone know the name of this font. I&#39;ve seen it used on the cover and
  in the spreads of GQ and Wired Magazine. Since both Magazines are using it I assume
  it&#39;s not proprietary. Any ideas? I know it has a lower case too.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22245.jpg"

  body: Here&#39;s the link to the full alphabet showing of the <a href="http://www.on-idle.com/foundry/foundry_gridnik/gridnik_bold.html"
    target="_blank"> Bold weight</a>. <BR> <BR><i> Foundry Gridnik, described as &#39;the
    thinking man&#39;s Courier&#39;,  <BR>derives from a typeface that was originally
    designed by  <BR>Dutch designer Wim Crouwel in the late 60s, as a single  <BR>weight
    typewriter face, but it was never released as a font.  <BR>A modified version
    of it can still be seen today in Crouwel&#39;s  <BR>1976 designs for the low-value
    postage stamps of the ppt,  <BR>Dutch post office, which feature the stamp value
    only,  <BR>displaying the numerals to full effect. The Foundry  <BR>has named
    the typeface Gridnik because of Crouwel&#39;s  <BR>devotion to grids and systems
    in his work to create  <BR>visual order; he was often affectionately referred
    to in  <BR>the 60s as &#39;Mr Gridnik&#39; by his friends and contemporaries.</i>
    <BR> <BR>Dare I quote Piet Schreuders on Crouwel? <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
