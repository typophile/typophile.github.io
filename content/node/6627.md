body: ' I am currently in my senior year of undergradate study in graphic design in
  Boston.  For my final project this semester I have been given the typeface Brush
  Script and cannot find any information on its designer.  I have called several type
  houses, searched every magazine, book and web-site withing my reach.  All I have
  ascertained is that a man named Robert E. Smith designed the orignal type in 1942.  I
  can find no further information him or the typfaces transfer to computer.  I&#39;m
  beggining to feel as if I am searching for something or someone who has fallen off
  the face of the earth.  If anyone has any suggestions or even better some sort of
  information it would greatly simplify my life. <BR>thanks, <BR>    MartyK '
