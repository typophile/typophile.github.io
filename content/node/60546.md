  body: 'Not in Door county, but not too far away: <a href="http://www.jmkac.org/">The
    Kohler Art Center</a> in Sheboygan is great. Nothing to do with type, but worthwhile
    if you like "outsider" art. Every time we''ve been there there''s something interesting.
    Be sure to check out the washrooms. <a href="http://www.mschettl.com/">M. Schettl</a>
    in Oshkosh is pretty cool, too. Again, not necessarily type-related.'
