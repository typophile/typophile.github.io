  and full-time <a href=\"http://www.veer.com\">Veer</a>ster celebrates his 30-something
  birthday today. Grant is the quintessential Typophile, dipping his toes in every
  aspect of typography - fontographing, selling, writing, and all the tech stuff.
  He's been around the block and knows what's what and I'm proud to call him a pal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grant2.jpg]\r\n\r\nPictured:

    while having my mug stuck in front of a webcam for the past decade... don't pick
    your nose.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the conservatively varietal series of images.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and it's actually <i>40-something</i>. I can only lucidly dream of my 30s at this
    point.\r\n\r\nTa."
