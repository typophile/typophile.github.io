  is a larger scale image of the font ID in the lower right corner, which unfortunately
  seems to be only a number reference and is to fuzzy for me to decipher properly

  image is from Nick Sherman's photostream at Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicksherman/14227285408/in/photostream/\r\nGiven
  the subject matter, I suspect the font is of German origin.\r\nBTW here is a very
  poor quality translation:\r\n   Golden Grape \r\n   Most distinguished \"Stranger's
  house\" ?\r\n   Big Concert Park is a superb place \r\n   Directly at the station's

  body: "Don\u2019t know the typeface, but as a german speaker I can give some corrections
    to the translations: \r\n\r\nThe priority in the shown spread is on the frames.
    The blurry line reads \xBBEinfassung Serie 613 (or G13?) 9 Cicero. Gesch\xFCtzt\xAB
    which means \xBBFrames serie 613 (or G13?) 9 Cicero Trademarked\xAB. So the frames
    are what it is all about. \r\n\r\nThe sujet itself should be an (virtual?) ad
    to a hotel named \xBBGold\u2019ne Traube\xAB (Golden Grape), occupied obviuosly
    by Woldemar Bodenbach. \r\nThe text reads: \r\n\r\nGoldne Traube (Golden Grape)\r\nVornehmstes
    Fremdenhaus (Most exclusive Hotel [literally \xABstrangers house\xAB])\r\nGro\xDFer
    Konzertpark \u2013 Herrliche Umgebung (Big concert park \u2013 Magnificent surroundings)\r\nDirekt
    am Bahnhofe \u2013 Eigene Weinkelterei (Next to the railway station \u2013\_Own
    winery)\r\nWoldemar Bodenbach\r\n\r\nThe typeface itself reminds me a bit of Eckmann

  body: "Thanks Fivos & Ryuk for the mention of Edelgotisch & Carmen. I guess this
    was a font designed to compete directly with them.\r\nIt would be interesting
    to see a specimen with all the letters and numbers to check the similarities,
    and differences.\r\nThanks Renko for the good translation -- BTW I misread the
    final _ch_ ligature as a peculiar _m_ -- and the info that the blurry text does
    not refer to the font itself.\r\nThis is the first I heard about the Tipoteca
    Italiana foundry. Google gives over 20,000 hits for the term \"Tipoteca Italiana\"
    but digging though it has so far not answered my question. Sometimes Google vies
    thousands of results, but they are not relevant to the point being researched.

  body: "I believe that I completely misinterpreted the source of my original image.
    \r\nFrom looking at the images immediately before and after in the photostream
    I now interpret this as a page from a Schelter & Geisecke specimen book at the
    Tipoteca Italiana museum rather than a page from a Tipoteca Italiana specimen
    book. \r\nSo the font might have been produced by Schelter & Geisecke as a variation
    of its own Edelgotisch.\r\nBased on information in Ralf Hermann's page -- Thanks
    Renko for the reference -- it might be that Albert Knab designed the Edelgotisch
    familar to us and this was produced by Schelter & Giesecke in 1901. The foundry
    produced a schmalfette [narrow bold?] version in 1904 .\r\nI suspect that the
    specimen I am seeking to identify is in fact this schmalfette version.\r\nDon"
