  body: It's detail-oriented. Detail oriented might lead to confusing modifiers (thus,
    ambiguity) in the sentence.

  body: No problem. I was surprised that it took so long for anyone to actually answer
    your inquiry.

  body: "Actually, the answer isn't quite right. Multiple adjectives before a noun
    are hyphenated:\r\n\r\n<cite>This is my long-range rifle.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf they
    are put after the noun, no hyphen:\r\n\r\n<cite>This is the rifle I shoot at long
    range.</cite>\r\n\r\nBTW, everyone is detail oriented. What's important is what
    details they are interested in. Only a certified compulsive is interested in all
    of them. Most companies don't hire *certified* compulsives."
