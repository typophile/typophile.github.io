  body: Well the S appears to have been customly neutered. The logo probably based
    on a font but I don&#39;t know which one right now.

  body: Ah, neat. But as mentioned in the other thread. <BR>What an obnoxious <a href="http://www.textaxis.com">website</a>
    that fella has. It actually made me a little bit angry. <BR> <BR>So does this
    mean that the logo is completely <BR>custom made?  <BR>I would guess he has made
    it himself as he apparently is making fonts.

  body: No, man. It is a totally hopeless site. Whenever you think you are going to
    view some font you are tricked as some new and irritating button shows up to mock
    you.  <BR>And I think I might need therapy to help me off this rage now built
    up inside of me. <BR> <BR>Dang <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
