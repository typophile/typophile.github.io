  identification is believed to be one of the two probable ways that information is
  processed by the eye. Researchers are divided between [[word shape]] recognition
  and letter identification as the process by which information is processed during
  reading.\r\n\r\nLetter identification theory posits that a reader identifies and
  recognizes a word through a part based pattern matching process. Perhaps identifying
  whole letters or parts of letters rapidly until the word is identified and comprehended."
