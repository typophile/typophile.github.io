body: I not sure if this is an actual Typeface. <BR>I have tried using whatthefont.com
  and identifont to no avail. <BR>I think this typeface has been made with a illustrator
  or freehand pen tool to achieve a handwriting/ pentool line style. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38871.jpg"

  body: No... it was more recent than that. I didn&#39;t discover this site until
    March. There&#39;s a whole chunk of archive missing and I remember a thread about
    connected scripts like this maybe 2 months ago. Yves???

  body: Yves, do you remember the same thread I do - there are certainly other fonts
    &#40;besides Memima&#41; that have that same connected look, but I don&#39;t know
    the names. <BR> <BR>Congrats on the bambina by the way.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> As I rely heavily on the search  <BR>function for these
    kinda things I can&#39;t help out much  <BR>right now. I&#39;ve just made Joe
    aware of the archive  <BR>situation and he&#39;s looking into it &#40;I hope&#41;.
