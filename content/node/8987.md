body: hi all, <BR>i just started using FontLab and &#40;of course&#41; im pretty lost.  <BR>i
  have all the letter forms drawn in illustrator and i export each to an eps. for
  some reason that i can&#39;t get, FontLab does not allow me to import the eps files.
  well as metter of fact it did let me import 4 of them but no more. is there any
  thing i should check in the export dialoge box in Illustrator? do you have any other
  ways i can solve it?? thanks !! <BR>Roy

  body: Roy, your best bet for starter type questions might be to go to the FAQ on
    Fontlab&#39;s site.
