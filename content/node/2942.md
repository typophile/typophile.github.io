body: I&#39;m trying to develop a logo for a Dermatology office. I&#39;ve gone through
  a bunch of ideas and these are the finalists. The office does both cosmetic and
  medical dermatology. What do you think? &#40;colors coming soon&#41; <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'What I&#39;m thinking is that the wavy boundary in the first two should:
    <BR>1&#41; Gently follow the contour of the word &#40;you know, like a bouma :-&#41;
    by being higher where the &#34;D&#34; and &#34;el&#34; are &#40;both of which
    you might make taller to emphasize the effect. <BR>AND <BR>2&#41; Look like the
    silhouette of a person lying on her side. <BR> <BR>BTW, the third I don&#39;t
    like, and the bottom one would be great if there&#39;s some Swiss connection!

  body: Hehe. The third was the clients favorite from the last batch. I don&#39;t
    like it either. I&#39;m going to work on the top one some more because it&#39;s
    my favorite so far. Thanks!
