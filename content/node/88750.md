body: "According to [[http://imprint.printmag.com/typography/veer-shifts-sights/|this
  article in Imprint]], Veer will not be acquiring and selling licences for new typefaces.
  \"The many tasty typefaces former \u201CHead of Type\u201D Joe Newton curated over
  the last three years will remain intact; but the collection will be frozen in time\u2014at
  least for now\u2014with no new additions on the [near] horizon.\"\r\n\r\nThis news
  about Veer seems sad and unexpected to me. Its predecessor, Image Club Graphics,
  was the first place I ever purchased fonts. It happens to be the most recent place
  I purchased a font, too. Their current collection will remain, but it won't grow,
  and that seems tragic. An initial urge is to jump to the conclusion that Corbis
  is focussed too much on profits and loss, and should allow Veer to do what it does
  so well, despite the current bottom line. But I suppose that would be na\xEFve,
  uninformed and maybe both.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it seems like a sad time for type. Then
  there's that phrase, \"at least for now.\" Does that mean there may be a shift back?
  Living in hope \u2026"

  body: "The curation model might not look good on a corporate bottom line.\r\nJoe
    was making a lot of specimens.\r\n\r\nI have always thought that the original
    online retail font distribution model, as pioneered by Makambo, was the best (with
    \u201Cwizard\u201D software that enabled suppliers to upload and manage their
    products with minimum effort from the distributor), and it\u2019s why I started
    my foundry in the first place. \r\n\r\nNow if distributors could just standardize
    on a common size for specimens/banners, then foundries could do all the work of
    producing specimens\u2014without having to produce differently sized and proportioned
    banners for each distributor. It\u2019s a marketing principle, known as \u201Ccollateral\u201D,
    used in the printosphere for generations, but one which font resellers have been
    largely blind too. With the exception of Ethan Dunham at Fontspring, which utilizes
    the MyFonts \u201Cposter\u201D size.\r\n\r\nStrangely, many resellers don\u2019t
    avail themselves of their suppliers\u2019 marketing materials, and produce their
    own banners etc. Sure, that gives them control and consistency in branding, but
    as the Veer situation may have shown, it\u2019s not the most cost-effective. Anyway,
    is there a downturn in the font market? Not that I\u2019ve noticed.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of Makambo, that site went under, dropped by the conglomerate that owned it during
    the dotcom crash of 1999. A similar situation with Veer, I would imagine, the
    parent company cost-cutting its least profitable divisions, or looking for ways
    to cut costs during an economic downturn. \r\n\r\nBut stopping new product launches
    doesn\u2019t make much sense for fonts, as that is when a typeface\u2019s sales
    are most lively.\r\n\r\nHowever, fonts do have a longer life than most other software,
    so I would expect Veer to be able to continue, silent running, for a while."

  body: "\"Corbis is focussed too much on profits and loss\"\r\n\r\nA not too uncommon
    problem...specifically, short term P&L is often too much of a focus...or as I
    suspect this case may be...to narrow of a focus on one particular part of the
    business at the sacrifice of the overall brand image. \r\n\r\n\"Now if distributors
    could just standardize on a common size for specimens/banners, then foundries
    could do all the work of producing specimens\"\r\n\r\nWith all the due respect
    I can muster for the highly talented type designers out there (seriously and sincerely)...I
    do have to say that more often than not, it seems, they aren't necessarily good
    graphic designers. There's a LOT of ugly on MyFonts. Some great fonts, but uglified
    in their little banner/specimen designs*. Veer definitely had one of the finer
    specimen catalog layouts IMHO. \r\n\r\n* and that's not to say it's a universal
    truth...as many great foundries, like House are both incredibly talented type
    foundries as well as graphic design houses and make stunningly beautiful specimen
    catalogs. \r\n\r\n"
