  want to be annoying, but it would be nice to hear from them.\r\n\r\nOk, so this
  one of mine gave me a three day deadline for a project, was impatient when I delivered
  later in the afternoon, then didn't respond for a week.  Earlier this week, I get
  a response that says, sorry for keeping you waiting, I'll let you know tomorrow.\r\n\r\nStill
  haven't heard back."

  body: We generally write to them asking if there has been any progress, and close
    with something like "we're mindful of your deadline". Usually get an explanation/update
    at that way.

  body: "Not sure I fully understand your question. Are you concerned about a project
    falling behind schedule while you're waiting for feedback? Or just annoyed that
    you rushed to meet their deadline and now they're acting like the deadline wasn't
    so important after all?\r\n\r\nWhen a project has a tight deadline I'll remind
    the client when I drop off layouts that I must have their feedback by a certain
    date if we're going to stay on schedule. If they miss that deadline, I remind
    them. I've found most clients to be appreciative of such reminders as long as
    they are done politely.\r\n\r\nIt's important that discussions of schedule be
    in writing (email, for example) so you've got a written record if they try to
    blame you later for the project falling behind schedule.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    if you're mainly just annoyed that you worked hard to meet a deadline and suddenly
    the deadline is starting to look rather arbitrary, well, I agree that it's a frustrating
    situation.  Not much you can do about a client who is thoughtless except decide
    not to work for them again if you're really ticked off about it. But personally
    I can put up with a lot of annoying behavior as long as they pay my invoices on
    time.\r\n"

  body: "I can sympathize with your feelings.\r\nBut, they are the client and you
    like to work for them. If not, end the relation.\r\n\r\nClients don't tell you
    everything that is going on in the office. \r\nMaybe there a lot of politics going
    on you have no clue about. If you did now, you may react in a different way.\r\n\r\nIf
    this is becoming a normal way of doing business on their part, you can discuss
    this with them. I don't see any problems doing that.\r\n\r\nSee yourself as an
    extension of your client. If you make your clients life easier, you will have
    a happy client. "

  body: "Years ago I did a rush job for an important client. They told me they HAD
    to have it by noon the next day.  I put my other projects on hold, worked all
    day and all night, drove to the airport like a madman at 6 am to put the package
    on a flight so they'd have it by noon, and was in such a rush that I dented my
    car's bumper in the airport parking lot. But I made it.\r\n\r\nTwo days later
    I still hadn't heard a \"thank you\", so I called. The client said \"Yeah I've
    got your package here somewhere, but I haven't had time to look at it yet.\"  \r\n
    \r\nI wanted to scream. But they were otherwise a good client, so I let it slide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
