  body: "but don't You think that serif font will has too old style look?\r\nThe company
    has got a modern and a little bit sport style but still elegant, so I thought
    that sans serif ( elegant like FONTIN) will be the best one.\r\n\r\nI made something
    like that.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/czek_6070.jpg]"

    classy serifs out there.\r\nYou've picked a humanist sans-serif so that's the
    search term you need. May I suggest my own humanist sans typeface, though? bureauroffa.com,
    the regular is free."
