    fitting two F&#39;s together like that hasn&#39;t been though up by many logo
    designers before.  I frequently see almost identical logos thought up around the
    same time by different designers for different companies.   <BR> <BR>Example:
    that &#34;Rohr&#34; logo in the Critique forum is almost the same as the logo

    to know if I was in danger of being sued anytime soon. <BR> <BR>Does that type

    a client. I was pretty happy with it, until I noticed that it formed a swastica
    in the center. I tried a couple of other variations, but couldn&#39;t get rid
    of the swastica without leaving a gap in the middle, so I dropped it. <BR> <BR><img

    property law -- Trademark, not Copyright. Unlike copyright, which accrues to the
    creator upon the act of creation &#40;under all copyright laws that I know of
    anyway&#41;, trademark protection is usually only offered after registration and
    a period of review. Also, the guidelines for determining infringement are specific
    to trademark law.  <BR> <BR>If &#34;Satan&#34; has any concerns, he/she should
    contact a trademark attorney for a professional opinion. <BR> <BR><i>Svastika</i>
    is a Sanskrit word derived from <i>svasti</i> &#40;&#34;well-being, fortune, luck,
    success, prosperity&#34;&#41;. Svastika can refer in general to any auspicious
    mark or object, but it is most commonly used to indicate the familiar swastika
    symbol. Some claim that the direction of the arms has significance, but I suspect
    this is a post-WWII revisionism designed to distance the original symbol from
    the Nazi appropriation/corruption of it. Steven Heller wrote an entire book about
    this.'

    Ian Swift&#39;s <i>Maze 91</i>. This guy was so outraged he virtually accused
    us of being Nazis! I fear this negative conotation is so engrained in our collective
    memory that it won&#39;t ever go away. Then again, he was the only customer in
    the entire FS network we ever heard of who was irked by the character. Methinks
    it&#39;s just a question of interpretation, and I suspect some people to intentionally
    go looking for these kind of things. <BR> <BR>Graham, I&#39;m very impressed.
    <BR> <BR>Satan, I really don&#39;t know. Personnally, comparing your design to

    nobody would ever have noticed the swastica hidden in the center, but once I first
    noticed it, I always saw it each time I looked at the logo, so it spoiled the

  body: I am very interested by the swastika issue. <BR>I can confirm that the clockwise
    or counterclockwise direction is an after-WW2 assumption, since the symbol has
    always been used with positive meaning in both directions before the Nazi appropriation.
    <BR> <BR>Actually I had a short discussion with Heller when he wrote an essay
    on Outwest for my &#34;Letters&#34; book &#40;coming out before the end of.. etc.
    etc.&#41; and I mostly disagree with his conclusions. I have not read his book,
    but I have read an article on Baseline and what I actually consider wrong is the
    preconception against blackletter &#40;raised by Heller in another article&#41;.
    This is all part of a project I intend to develop on the redemption of the blackletter
    &#40;and maybe the swastika&#41; considering that, as Miles Newlyn pointed out
    talking about his Ferox typeface, perceptions towards graphic symbols always arise
    in context. <BR> <BR>When I will do it I will ask for the opinion of Typophile
    members. This tread has proved really interesting.

    use of swastikas - which would have been Paul&#39;s case if he hadn&#39;t noticed
    it. And this is in a book subtitled <i>Symbol Beyond Redemtion?</i>. He should
    be honest and leave out the question mark. The swastika might eventually redeem
    itself if it wasn&#39;t for people like Heller attacking football teams and skateboard
    companies for their choice of logo.  <BR>  <BR>I recently read Heinrich B
