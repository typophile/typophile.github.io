  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\nMichael your poker face at bidding needs work.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    think Rich may have used the wrong word.</em>\r\nAnyone who has ever been \"quoted\"
    \ is often \"edited\" without \"checking\" to see if what they are \"saying\"
    is factual. so, no I have never referred to a press as a printer (to any of my
    recollection). However I do get quite dusty when digging through type drawers,
    so it may well be true."

    is successful I will shave the beard and put it on 4 or 5 moth traps and give
    the money to the WNYBAC : ) I 'll let it go for 6 months... it will take a tractor
    trailer to deliver it to the winning bidder. \r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\nEdit: My wife
    would get a kick out of that. In 28 years she has never seen me clean shaven."
