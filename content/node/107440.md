body: The high school I graduated from has a locally iconic sign sprawled across the
  southwest lawn, and ever since I was a student there, I've wondered what font/type
  was used. The school was built in 1972-1973, and I presume the sign was made at
  that time.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hlb1_6472.jpg]

  body: "Given the era of this sign, it is likely to have been hand painted, and therefore
    not a commercially-available typeface. The style is reminiscent of some of the
    broad slab serifs or Egyptians of the wood type era, so this would be the first
    place to start in searching for a close approximation. Key features are the lateral
    oval shape of the O, double vertical serif on the C and the curl on the leg of
    the R, etc. ... the over all squarish countenance of the letters (e.g. the Eurostile-ish
    S) and the lack of stroke contrast.\r\n\r\nBut notice in this sign how no two
    letters are quite the same, with varying widths and weights further attesting
    to its hand-painted provenance. I fear you'll never find an exact match, but you
    may find something close."

  body: Thank you both very much! I forgot to mention that the sign was indeed hand-painted,
    and I figured it would be hard to pinpoint exactly what it is. Those are all very
    similar, Ryuk, and if I had to make a final guess, I'd say the sign uses a riff
    on Hellenic Wide. The library at a nearby university has a sign with an extremely
    similar style (also 1970s), but that one might actually be Hellenic Wide. Again,
    thanks to both of you! A cousin is in charge of her class reunion, and we thought
    it'd be neat to use the font for nametags and other items, so this is a big help.
