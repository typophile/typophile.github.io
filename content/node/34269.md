  related to type-composition for a multilanguage website. \r\nI designed some icons
  that goes with a dynamic label. These icons are drawn to fit the x-height of the
  word that follows. In french, english, spanish, etc., I have no special problem,
  i set the label in lowercase.\r\n\r\nBut my german translator doesn't agree. He
  says that german nouns should start with an uppercase -- and he is right, as regards
  to pure spelling. I would like to know if a <em>forced</em> lowercase composition
  would be admitted in german, if we also take care of the graphic dimensions of the
  couple icon/label. Or if that would be a too big spelling mistake.\r\n\r\nHave you
  experienced any similar problems ? and found solutions...\r\n\r\n-- In that same
  post, sorry : Do you know a good reference for multilinguistic typography ? I mean
  especially typographic rules and composition. I am desperate with seven languages
  to serve : french, english, italian, spanish, german, catalan and even polski.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help.\r\n\r\nJulien\r\n"

    \xBBinnovative\xAB your client is, because I see often german advertisings with
    all-lowercase. But that's not right orthographically, but looks nice in some ways.
    But be aware: If your client wants the navigation to be spelled right, you are
    on your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be safe: \r\n\u2022 Use all uppercase (but
    be careful with that, doesn't look good with many fonts)\r\nor\r\n\u2022\_use

    but the English translation running along on the same pages is set in Upper can

    All design choices have been done already. I don't even have the choice of the
    typeface. The question of how \xBBinnovative\xAB (\xAB innovative \xBB, \"inovative\"
    ;-) I and my client can be is the real point.\r\nWe went to a consensus, keeping
    main navigation items in lowercase, but setting all icons/labels in a correct
    german spelling. Neither the best choice, nor the worst; something between.\r\n\r\nMy
    problems with composition remains. I'll try to collect some sources by myself,
    but if you have some, ( in : english, italian, spanish, german, catalan and polish
    !), that would be a great help.\r\n\r\nJust related to quotation marks and especially
    oriented to webdesign, here is one : http://acjs.net/weblog/2005/06/10/language_specific_styling_quotation_marks/\r\n\r\nThank
    you all.\r\n"

    Herbert Bayer around 1925, I think. I don't think it has ever really caught on.
    Presuming that all other German text on the website will be in U&lc, it doesn't
    make much sense for the navigation to be all lowercase, I think. Consistency and
    the readers' expectations are more important than personal design vision\u2026"
