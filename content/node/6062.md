  body: Everything is off in this sample &#40;look at the oval, for starters&#41;.
    Looks like it was hand-done, and badly, but Tiff&#39;s id is right on.

  body: Do you suppose that it was condensed horziontally and vertically and a stroke
    added to it ? To me the serif esp on the &#34;P&#34; is shorter on the example..
    and the condenseing is all that could account for it..

  body: This is results from myfonts.com test drive next to the origional.. serifs
    are &#34;slightly off&#34; ????notice on the top serif on the &#34;P&#34; @ the
    bottom it slants downwards. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42761.gif"

  body: My guess is that it was drawn by hand or traced badly from old Letraset specimens,
    probably a weight that&#39;s not available digitally. Forget the serifs, look
    at the terrible counter on the P. This thing has probably also been reproduced
    so many times that it&#39;s lost whatever integrity it may once have had. Seriously,
    Dennis, this is simply a bad use of Lubalin Graph. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT use
    this as an example of something you should strive for.
