body: "Some good things are going on here with the Typophile codebase, not the least
  of which is inline image uploads. Only a few more things/bugs to check off our list
  before we can take the beta stripe off. To use the new image upload features you
  will need the Flash 8 player. Once you have it installed you will see an \"Insert
  image\" link on the post form. It's got a progress bar, no pop-ups, and no page
  reloads! Trust me, that's cool. On the downside, I'm sure we'll have to hear some
  whining about flash. Oh well. For Uppercase members, you might try editing your
  blog with ecto or any number of other blogging clients. More on this later.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChristianMakingTypophile.jpg]"

    the latest version of Safari, if that's relevant.)

  body: I do notice that the "Online users:" is formatted differently in Firefox than
    in Safari. In Firefox, it is formatted paragraph-style with gray vertical bars
    between names. In Safari, it's one name per line, like a list.

  body: "yes the Vespa is more wabblely, small wheels and very bottom heavy.. motorcycles
    are more stable and easier to take curves and move. But in England you have to
    do a test with a 500cc manual if you want to ride a proper motorcycle. America
    they seem to let you ride if you take a class. But in England you have to take
    a class just to be allowed to ride a 125cc scooter or motorcycle and that is as
    high as you can go until you do your full test and written test. \r\n\r\nI'm going
    to rent a Multistrada 620 if I can and also test the Honda CBR 600RR or 600F.
    the Honda sounds nice but the Ducati is cooler and a good city bike. The Suzuki
    Gn125 that I'm renting is a piece of junk.. clutch is loose it needs a bit of
    choke to start up and then has a bit of trouble keeping an idle. The gears can
    be a bit clunky and it can't hit 50mph even though I have done 53mph on my Vespa
    and the Vespa sounds better than the Suzuki."
