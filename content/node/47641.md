  \r\n\r\nFirst off, I would love a program that makes good use of organization and
  viewing a snap. Lets say I install a new font onto my computer and after I open
  my magic program, it reads the fonts installed in my system and can organize and
  interpret the family in belongs to and can create a page to print out and add to
  my 3 ring binder of fonts I own. After it prints it out, it could tell me where
  in book that the page could fall into. Think of it as a personal type librarian
  program that standardizes fonts and also makes it easy to install it or uninstall
  it like Adobe Type manager did it.\r\n\r\nI have seen some programs out there that
  do one of the above, but it never is as graceful or well thought out as I'd like
  it to be. I would love to hear your thoughts on the subject and any recommendations
  you may have!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJadan"
