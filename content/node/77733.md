  but for whatever reason Michael C Place (Build) has stole the show for me in the
  last year or so.\r\n\r\nHe has used this typeface before on a few projects, but
  I am just curious what it is. I love how he uses older lettraset fonts and legacy
  faces like Glaser, Beans, Akzidenz Grotesk, etc and gets them to twist nicely. I
  am just curious if he is using a custom face, or  what.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/156_6097.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1dd3ecebb57b824e03d3826744b856eb_5868.jpg]"

  body: From that link, though, I see that Mandatory didn't have a backwards Q, like
    the example has.

    conclusion was, in fact, that it isn\u2019t Mandatory (but something inspired
    by it). And, by now, I suspect custom as well."
