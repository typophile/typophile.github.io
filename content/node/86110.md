body: "FontQA is reporting multiple errors (not merely warnings) with a face due to
  multiple dot suffixes (e.g. a.sc.alt). However, I'm unclear on why this should be
  a problem.\r\n\r\nIs this something which I can safely ignore, or is it crucial
  that there be only one suffix per glyph name? I frequently use multiple suffixes
  and have never run into problems. Are there situations which I am unaware of where
  this could be problematic. It doesn't seem to violate any specs that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: This is fine. The only thing to be aware of is that Adobe's name parsing will
    ignore everything after the first dot, which in this case would be correct.

  body: The public version of FontQA is rather old, and tends to be over-critical
    ;) Plus some tests reflect FontFont's internal standards. But even FontFonts are
    allowed to have multiple glyph name suffixes nowadays.
