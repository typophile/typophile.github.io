  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I have been reading about the advantages of OTF format and want to extend an old font beyond standard latin alphabet (A-Z). However, the font is originally in TTF format. I am wondering, after looking at the various pages on this site, is there a way of reducing the number of nodes in a OTF that has been converted from TTF without altering the shape of the glyph? I have seen "Optimise" and "Clean up" functions in FLS5 but they appear to alter the curves a bit. 

Also when reducing the font from 2048 to 1000 em, what is the best way of doing it? Clean up everything first, then reduce, or reduce first, then clean everything up?

Thanks for your help.</div>

One has the proper choices: 
convert and keep the exact shape, 
or convert and keep the exact points.

"But it does still need occasional tweaking?"

I suppose, if one is concerned about the output above 300 dpi, or so, one could tweak occasionally, and if not, not at all. </div>

IIRC, the 1000 limitation applies to Type 1 fonts (pfb/pfm) but NOT to CFF OT fonts.

Are there any known circumstances where a CFF OT  will fail if it has a UPM other than 1000? Six years ago Adam Twardoch said that InDesign assumes 1000 and uses a text cursor to match, so if the font has a UPM of 2000 the cursor would be sized at 50%.

@John Hudson - exactly! I have found that 1000em for CFF is best :-)

@ dberlow in your last post, you say that there are two proper choices, however, where do I find these options? When I open the font in Robofont, a popup message says "RoboFont will convert TrueType splines to splines with 2 offcurve points." so I click on ok. Then what? Forgive my ignorance, I have never used Robofont before.

The number of on-curve points (of which a quadratic derivative <em>may</em> have fewer) is only half the story; off-curve points (of which a cubic original <em>necessarily</em> has fewer) have to be there too.

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, much is going to depend on how the TTF outline looks to begin with. If a quadratic bezier outline has been fairly cleanly defined with on-curve points used only at extrema and where necessary, FontLab Studio -- Windows, at least, I've never tried the Mac version -- does a remarkably good job of converting to an accurate cubic (PS) bezier without introducing interpolated on-curve points between extrema. This illustration shows an original TTF outline and a converted PS outline; note that the number of cubic nodes is not affected by the number of off-curve quadratic points in the original:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttf2ps_6632.png]

It is as accurate in its preservation of curve quality as I think you can get given the fundamental differences in the mathematics involved. At typical type sizes, even at high resolution, these differences are smaller than the eye can discern. Here are the two outlines superimposed:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overlay_3822.png]

If the original TTF outline is less cleanly defined, then FontLab will tend to multiply the number of PS points, sometimes inserting them everywhere that the TTF off-curve points imply an intermediate on-curve point. The earlier FontLab conversion algorithm did this everywhere.

David, I'd be interested in seeing some illustrations of the results of the two RoboFont options. I think I understand what you mean, but pictures, thousands of words, etc..</div>

Indeed they do. But can you tell the difference? 

The answer to that is mainly how you look for the difference. One way is to toggle back & forth with the glyph displayed at 256 points & watch things change. Yup, it's different.

Another way is to print out the characters, both the original ttf and the optimized .otf, using a laser printer, at, say, 12 point (or whatever size will typically be used). Shuffle the paper & go home. Come in the next day, look only at the paper, and see if you can tell them apart.

We use to do this with loudspeakers, after raunchy stereo salesmen would try & tell us how much "better" the more profitable speaker system was. The "we" here is a couple recording engineers, who had far better ears than the salesman.

So the parallel for you, if you can't tell the glyphs apart, when used as they will be used, would be to get a type designer to critique the differences -- again, as used, not at 256 points on the screen, overlayed.

(Loudspeakers? I use Magneplaners. There are better choices if you're into rock 'n roll with a lot of bass... Otherwise, plan on a lot more money...) </div>

I would, presuming of course that we're talking about lard that you've rendered yourself from forage-fed pig fat, and not the hydrogenated stuff they sell in supermarkets.</div>

Although I have to doubt those particular critters are forage-fed. Speaking of what they're allowed to eat, the swineherds of the true "Pata Negra" variety of Jamón de Serra feed them <em>only</em> acorns - I wonder whether their lard is the best. But as wonderful as pigs are, if we loosen the definition of lard a bit there's nothing better than the tail of the Middle-Eastern sheep.

BTW because (almost) all the fat is in the tail, the meat is free of that pungent smell that turns so many people away from lamb (although not myself).

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry for the late reply, thank you all for your comments. @ John Hudson, how did you make your nodes coloured in your picture, when I highlight mine (on mac) they are red colour only and when they are not highlighted they are black.

From what I gather on this thread, it is not so important to have less nodes/points rather to have as many to make an accurate conversion?</div>
