  boat. I've attached the manufacturer logo that he would like to try and match.  Can
  someone suggest a common font that will match this font.  The only sticker that
  will be close to this logo will be the \"license\" number so it will only be letters.
  \ The other stickers will be far enough away from the logo that it should not be
  apparent that it is not an exact match.  Any help greatly appreciated.  nampaspencer@yahoo.com"
