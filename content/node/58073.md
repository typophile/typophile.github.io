  body: second that, it's a dreadful color. but you can fix that anytime. go for the
    single heart as the point on the I in the first direction. the size of that heart
    in the first exampleis good too--the second direction has them too small and too
    big, attracting too little or too much attention. the first one's heart matches
    the weight of the serif on the top bar of the letter a next to it rather well.

    see it as either \"old lady\" or \"little girl.\" \r\n\r\nHonestly? Combined with
    the heart over the i, I'd have rolled my eyes at this logo when I was in my early
    twenties. A hot color could change that...I'd head towards richer, bolder shades
    of pink that pop - like a warm, saturated magenta. \r\n\r\nThis flower might be
    a good image to hit with the eyedropper:\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/magenta-flower_5339.jpg]"

    intended market.\r\n\r\nThat aside, the centre of the flower seems almost perfectly
    circular. I think it would be better as a less geometric shape, as it's drawing
    my eye for no real reason.\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: Guys. I am currently experimenting with Georgia. It is a font the client really
    likes. But I wonder if it's good to use such a commonly known typeface on a logo?
    Are there certain things I should be aware when I use Georgia, like its kerning
    or if I can modify the characters. Btw, is it legal to modify typefaces?

    grandpa (mostly grandma)\r\nand also is \"d\xE9j\xE0 vu\" soo much, the kind of
    stuff you can find on wallpaper. Sorry to be so harsch,\r\nbut i think you have
    to start over or find a way to stylise this a more actual way."

    that supposed to be a source of inspiration? Could it be a source of inspiration?
    \r\n\r\nYour client may like what you've produced at this point, but with the
    heart on the 'i' it plays as kawaii kitsch, and not very hip or well-directed
    towards an 18-35 female demographic.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Imo your current styling does kinda lean toward \"grandma\" like others are
    saying, but it also leans toward rich conservative. Is this 18-35 demographic
    the young hipsters or the polo and pimm's crowd?\r\n\r\nI this Lex's suggestion
    of black type is a good idea.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a more graphic or geometric styling
    of the flower would bump up the vitality of the mark?"

    project. an illustrative logo would seem so much more beautiful and engaging.
    inspiration for that could be in tattoo flowers, japanese tattoos, etc. That type
    of styling would certainly seem more fit for the age group.\r\n\r\nhttp://fc06.deviantart.com/fs36/f/2008/247/4/5/Pink_Flower_heart_tribal_TaT_by_2Face_Tattoo.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nprob.

    drawn by me, then scanned into Illustrator. I like your idea, evanbrog, but like
    Phinney said that it wouldn't be ideal for a logo that will go onto clothing tags
    and such. To clarify, this shop targets the mid to upper-class, not very hipster
    and mainstream. And also this is a very small store, the floorplan just about
    the size of a single decker bus. \r\n\r\nAnd all those Grandma comments just make
    me laugh! Talk about how off-the-brief my work turned out. I wonder how Victoria's
    Angels manage to use so much pink and still look appealing!? "

  body: "Hmmm, good point, I was thinking of cases where the logo is essentially embroidered
    on the tag. But if it's printed CMYK process at press resolutions, well, you can
    do almost any darn thing you like.\r\n\r\nThat being said, in the long run logos
    may be used in all sorts of other ways, and an identity design generally should
    include a single-color version that can be reproduced under appalling conditions.
