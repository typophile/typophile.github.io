body: I am looking for a &#34;clean modern&#34; font for a wedding invitation.  The
  best example I have found is <BR><a href="http://www.letterpress.co.uk/style_info.php?style=B&amp;product=E"
  target="_blank">http://www.letterpress.co.uk/style_info.php?style=B&amp;product=E</a>
  <BR>Can anyone identify this font for me and are there other alternatives that I
  should consider? <BR>Thanks in advance

    consider House Industries <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">Neutraface</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/bernhard-gothic-sg/"

  body: I think the font looks very similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/martin-gothic/urw-t-bold/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Martin Gothic Bold</a>, which has the same stepped W, the same
    G and very similar R. <BR> <BR>The lighter weights of Martin Gothic have a W similar
    to Bernhard Gothic, with the crossed V&#39;s, but they do have the right G.
