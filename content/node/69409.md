  I'm thinking of doing the title of the book as well as the major headlines/subheads
  in a slab serif while having the body copy and captions in a sans serif typeface.\r\n\r\nJust
  wondering if anyone can recommend a really good sans serif typeface to go with a
  slab serif? "

    but all ITC softness grinded out.

    just recently. \r\n\r\n@Tomi...I like yours a lot. I may have to pick that up.
    \r\n\r\nDo either of you have any suggestions for a good sans serif to go with
    Archer or Suomi Slab?\r\n\r\nI don't think I want to use the Slab Serif for my
    body copy."

    a forum by constant self-promotion and bad advice is not the way to build your
    brand.\r\nPost your new typeface in the Release forum, take out an ad."

    comments that bumped old threads and hence probably wouldn\u2019t have helped
    the original posters, and also those where your comment clearly was off-topic
    (\u2018looking for a serif \u2026\u2019). Self-promotion per se is not prohibited
    on Typophile. It depends on context and dosage. Posting a load of (virtually)
    identical comments will surely be perceived as spamming."
