  body: Don&#39;t you think this might be custom lettering? The &#34;EW&#34;, &#34;RS&#34;
    and &#34;TY&#34; ligatures, as well as the two different Rs seem to indicate this.
    Rookledge&#39;s was no help at all. :/

    <BR> <BR>The &#34;thins&#34; are a little TOO thin, but the basic character shapes
    are mighty close. <BR> <BR>.'
