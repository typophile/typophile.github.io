  body: "This style is sooo familiar, with these letterforms, and the shape of the
    S, but the closest I can find is a more vertical script called Hostess, sold by
    Type Revivals. The sample is from the Script Guide. Imagine it slanted.\r\n\r\n-

  body: You beat me to it, Mike. <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit">House's
    Signpainter House Script</a> is an exact match. It also has a ligature to fix
    the r.

  body: "Argh, House Script it is? Funny, I  tried the font twice online, as it had
    so many similarities, but couldn\u2019t find a solution for the r (and the longer
    descender of the p?)\u2026 Good to know about that alternate. \r\n\r\nExcellent
    work, Paul and Mike. "
