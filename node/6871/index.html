  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We have a significant service coming up at the &#40;Church of England&#41; church I go to in London--the Bishop is coming to dedicate a newly painted icon. It is a black madonna, given in memory of a 16 year old victim of a shooting. I think it warrants special thought about the design of the service book, and I am considering getting a new typeface specifically for it. <BR> <BR>The core requirements are: <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; Economical, especially in horizontal space consumption. Because prayers are set like verse, one wants to avoid turnover lines, and a slightly condensed type does that. <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; A good legible bold because prayers the congregation says are set in bold. It needs to be easily distinguishable from the normal weight, but also easy to read. <BR> <BR>&#40;3&#41; A self-effacing italic, because italic is used for rubrics which are not particularly important. <BR> <BR>&#40;4&#41; A low cap-height because prayers are full of capital letters scattered mid-sentence &#40;God, Jesus Christ, Holy Spirit, Father, Son, Lord etc ...&#41; and one wants to minimize the ugliness. <BR> <BR>&#40;5&#41; A good plain text face -- nothing sentimental or churchy in either the Victorian &#40;Ye Gothicke&#41; or modern &#40;sentimental calligraphic&#41; veins. <BR> <BR>I saw Arnhem in Kinross&#39;s Unjustified Texts, and thought that it might work. But it&#39;s expensive enough that I don&#39;t want to make a mistake. Does anyone have any experience of using it? Would it fit the bill. <BR> <BR>&#40;PS: The CofE itself used to use Palatino, and currently uses Gill Sans. I have used both Ehrhardt and Galliard in the past. Orthodoxy for home-produced services is either Arial &#40;they think it&#39;s Gill&#41; or Comic Sans &#40;cos it&#39;s &#34;friendly&#34;, of course&#41;, but I&#39;m a heretic.&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for both answers. I don&#39;t know Print. Anything reasonably accessible set in it? &#40;I am terrible at judging what type will look like when set just from samples.&#41; <BR> <BR>Minion is I agree an obvious choice; I have it, which is a bonus. I also have a probably unjustified prejudice against it &#40;perhaps because one sees so much of it about&#41;, but I suppose I should probably overcome that, and at 10pt it does look nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestion. I don&#39;t believe Print was on my radar screen at all, and it&#39;s rather admirable &#40;I&#39;m going on the PDFs; I should check out Print itself--presumably St Bride&#39;s, which I work very close to but have never visited, would have it&#41;. To my eye it teeters on the edge of being too condensed &#40;I suppose I mean, it is on the edge of actually appearing condensed&#41;. But I suppose &#34;teetering on the brink&#34; successfully is a fair hallmark of good design, and it certainly looks promising. <BR> <BR>BTW, I do wish it was easier to find raw data about things like cap-height, copyfitting etc -- the sort of thing you get in older books on book design. I know the figures don&#39;t tell the whole story, but they do tell quite an interesting story, and it would be very useful when looking at a sample to be given them.</div>
