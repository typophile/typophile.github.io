  body: If that's FF DIN it must be stretched horizontally. DIN is a hint narrower
    (cf. here https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/din/regular ). That's also why this looks
    a bit messy, as the [no-]contrast is thrown off.

  body: Yes, I agree, it doesn't look quite right, so I suspect some distortion is
    evident.
