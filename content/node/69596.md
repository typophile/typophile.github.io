    this, I had forgotten about Caflisch which is also very good, but a bit too even.
    I think its somewhere between the two.\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions!\r\n\r\nJon"

  body: "@ Jon >We ended up with P22 Vincent\r\n\r\nI hope you will never need it
    for German text. The Eszett (germandbls, \xDF) of Vincent is crap: just a modified
    uppercase B. Many non-German type designers think the \xDF was an uppercase character,
    but it is strictly lower case*. \r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n_________\r\n* Unicode 5.X
    has an uppercase \xDF now, but the need for it is contested."
