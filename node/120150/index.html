  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey Folks,</p>
<p>This is my first post here at typophile. I&rsquo;ve been working for a long time trying to create a new font for the Rocky Horror community to use for their advertising. There already exists one font, Double Feature, that emulates the Rocky Horror credits, but I have found that it gets a little stale as there is only one alternate for each letterform, or sometimes none at all. In the actual credits everything was hand drawn, so every single character is different. I wanted to create a font that has at least four alternates for each character and allows a designer to immediately cycle through them without having to individually alter settings for each. To accomplish this I used and abused ligatures.</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/Screen Shot 2014-10-03 at 12_5056.08.33 AM.png)</p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshot, I have it set up so that upper and lowercase characters are identical. My ligatures are set up so that a letter just has to be tapped repeatedly to cycle though the alternate options. In the case that the designer actually needs to repeat a letter they would have to switch between upper and lower case for the characters. This is probably a crude way of doing things, but it is working out how I envisioned.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Specimen_6131.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I have hit a problem though. I also created alternate characters for the numbers, and had imagined to use them the same way, so that tapping either 1 or ! would first cycle through the &ldquo;1&rdquo; options and then set an exclamation point. However when I write the ligature code and attempt to compile with either numbers or symbols I receive errors. Is there any way to make them work, or could someone recommend a different way of achieving this?</p>
<p>Also, as I was searching around the forums to see if anyone had tried anything similar I noticed that the recommendation for naming ligatures is to either put an underscore or a period between the characters. Is this vital? As you can see my ligatures currently are just named A2, A3, A4 etc., and I haven&rsquo;t yet noticed and complications but I&rsquo;d like to change it now if it is necessary.</p>
<p>Cheers!
Shawn</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your numbers and symbols aren&rsquo;t working because you&rsquo;ve given them invalid names. Glyph names have to be alphanumeric and start with a letter. Refer to the names of the original characters. I think you should be able to get away with &ldquo;one5&rdquo; even though the recommended format for a ligature would be &ldquo;one_one_one_one_one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The other allowed symbol, the period, would be used if you were setting up your alternates properly (and I understand why you won&rsquo;t be doing that). For example, &ldquo;one.ss02&rdquo;, accessed by Stylistic Set 2, would be truncated back to &ldquo;one&rdquo; upon copying out plaintext.</p>
<p>Another problem I see is that your substitution order is upside-down. Bigger ligatures should go first, because if X X is already swapped out, X X X won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
