  body: "@ Tiff:\r\n\r\nI've got a little more time so I'll explain my earlier comment
    about the talented ones and share my mishap with a chisel.\r\n\r\nIf you look
    at the tip of your index finger from the side you'll see a very small area that
    extends past the end of a trimmed fingernail... just enough to slice off if you're
    stupid enough to hold the ruler wrong.\r\n\r\nI was busy trimming a ton of proofs
    at work when I made a pull with the X-Acto blade. On the paper I saw a small circular
    shaped object and went to flick it out of the way. That's when I realized it was
    the end of my finger. I quickly looked at the damage and to my amazement there
    wasn't any blood. However, it was perfectly flat and had this very weird sensation
    when you touched it.\r\n\r\nAfterward someone told me that the human body has
    something like 7 or 8 layers of skin. Instead of admit I was extremely lucky I
    told everyone it was all talent. ;)\r\n\r\nNow, for the not so lucky 'chisel incident'
    in college.\r\n\r\nI was working on a wooden sculpture in my dorm room and was
    moments from finishing. A piece of the masterpiece didn't fit quite right and
    I was removing the last bit of material. Just then my girlfriend walked in. This
    was just enough to distract my focus as I proceeded to jam a small chisel about
    3/4\" into the soft area of my left hand at the base of my thumb.\r\n\r\nI looked
    up to see the shock on her face. The pain didn't come until I went to pull it
    out. I nearly passed out. On the advice of some with leveler heads we went to
    the emergency room where the doctor was shocked I didn't severe any tendons.\r\n\r\nHappy
    Halloween everyone."
