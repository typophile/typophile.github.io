  the handmade aesthetic, but i''m always a bit perplexed at the sale of ''digital
  prints''. it seems like an easy way out to me, i mean, i want something with more
  of a tactile presence: screen printed at least. can anyone give me some good reasons
  at why i shouldn''t be such a snob about printing process and help me make peace
  with purchasing mass-produced, completely computer generated art? (not completely,
  you know what i mean!)'

    something from Etsy then surely ( the dominant aesthetic aside for 2 seconds )
    the reason you are getting it is 1) you can afford it 2) you like it. Those are
    good reasons - surely. That may not be the fine art market uses, but it is the
    model used by the record collector. Is that so bad? \r\n\r\nBut even as I say
    these things I admit that it is not very often that I look at something that came
    out of a digital device and think... \"oh that's nice\" from the point of view
    of it's \"object\" values. Eg the texture, weight, kind of color it has and so
    on. But if it was a nice big poster, or an illustration that I loved - I feel
    like I could be cool with it's digital-ness."

    artists out there working in digital\u2014even guys like Jim Dine\u2014who produce
    stellar digital prints with the assistance of exceptional printers who work with
    great printers and materials. And I do like the unpretentious, no-art-world-bullshit
    nature of people running off unlimited editions for sale online, or selling limited
    editions at low-prices by cutting out the galleries.\r\n\r\nBut some of these
    people just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Many of them don\u2019t list
    the materials used to make the prints. Inkjet prints are a total crapshot; AFAIK
    only Epson is really trying to make good pigmented inks that won\u2019t fade.
    Other inks might fade in only months, the chemicals in some inkjet papers can
    also do weird things over time. The worst prints are shot out of a laser printer
    on heavy office paper that will yellow and become brittle.\r\n\r\nSo I guess you
    really just have to be a snob, do your homework, and ask questions before you
    buy."

    you''ve ever messed around with an Epson inkjet, you''ll know that. To me the
    difference has more to do with whether it''s archival or not - the type of ink,
    the type of paper - than the method. '

    this is somewhat true, there are -- and have been for quite some years -- UV-resistant
    inks available for pretty much every brand. Those are usually pretty longlasting.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also cover prints with UV-blocking laminate. I have one huge inkjet print
    that I covered with such laminate (we could do that where I worked at the time)
    and it hasn't faded at all in 4 or 5 years. Although I must add that I remember
    that the laminate used was quite expensive, something like 80 euros per meter
    square. But it really makes the prints last long, and gives it a nice finish."

    takes a lot of hand work at it. It can be output to canvas using a ink jet printer.
    Assuming it is really art and not a \u201Cgigl\xE9\u201D out of a famous painting.
    You may be surprise at the quality.\r\n\r\nDigital is cheaper!\r\n\r\nYou would
    never get the same feel as if it was printed with litographic stone or fancy copper
    or brass plates; those are awesomely expensive. Silkscreen can do a good job but
    also costs more then the ink jet.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is a budget question."

    out to be a selling point for me if it turns out that digital prints are actually
    'greener' than other processes, such as silk screen...

  body: "Paul, go do some screenprinting yourself, and see what a mess it is. ;)\r\n\r\nEmulsions,
    inks (although those are usually waterbased these days), sodium hydroxide/lye/caustic
    soda (whatever it's called) to clean the screens of ink, etc. Printing usually
    also wastes alot of paper (adjusting trapping, etc.) So in that sense inkjets
    are probably greener.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, inkjet printers have to be made,
    cartridges and ink have to be made and the plastics end up in the environment,
    etc. So all in all it probably doesn't really matter. ;)\r\n"

  body: "Paul, I don't know anything really about commercial silkscreening but I do
    know that hand silkscreening uses hideous chemicals and needs to be done in a
    very well-ventilated space, such as outside. That is about the sum total of my
    knowledge on the subject, sorry! Photo darkroom chemicals are not so great either.
    The photography teacher in my high school (who smoked in the darkroom, everyone
    did) died at 40 of lung cancer. Obviously the smoking didn't help, but I'm just
    sayin...\r\n\r\nI think your prejudice against digital prints - while understandable
    - is something you'll just need to get over. You see them in museums and galleries
    all the time now. It's just a different technique but as AGL (and I) said, it
    takes just as much skill to coax a beautiful print out of your inkjet printer
    than to screen it or print it in a darkroom."

    thats true. We have a rather well equipped screenprinting workshop at my art academy.
    So I occasionally do some printing there. The workshop is completely ventilated.\r\nBut
    it isn't as bad as it used to be; the only chemicals that are somewhat nasty are
    lye (to clean ink off screens), which is slightly corrosive, and some other solvents.
    So it's smart to wear goggles when applying lye and blasting the screen clean
    with a pressure washer afterwards. The photo emulsions and such are probably also
    not the most healthy substances, but they aren't particularly irritating. They
    do not sting on your skin or throat and such.\r\n\r\nBut most inks are water based
    these days. Back in the day especially the inks were quite nasty. So you don't
    really need very strong solvents anymore. We only use those old inks for printing
    on surfaces that repel water, like highly reflective plastics or something like
    that.\r\n\r\nBut if we're talking green... tons of paper towels, masking tape,
    testing paper for aligning the printing surface, leftover ink you can't keep for
    long, water, etc."

    way to display certain content. \r\n\r\nAlso, as others have mentioned, the cost
    plays a significant role here too. Depending on what art we're talking about,
    I would guess that most of the market for digital prints is people who couldn't
    afford a comparable piece of original art (or a print using a more expensive process)."

  body: Patty is correct - it is not the basic process but what is done with it -
    done in the right way a digital print can be as valid as a hand pulled etching
    or lithograph. On the right paper even a laser printer can produce a great "wood
    engraving".
