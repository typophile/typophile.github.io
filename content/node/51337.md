  been lurking for a while.  I have just upgraded a couple of months ago from Font
  Creator to Fontlab Studio 5.0.4.  I have noticed when creating fonts in the FLS,
  the finished file size is HUGE (300kb-1.4mg) compared to FC under 100kb.  Am I doing
  something wrong?  I am creating many of the Latin characters using the Glyph generator
  and then decomposing them before generating the font. I am also keeping the UPM
  at the defaults for now.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at high quality fonts that I have purchased
  by top designers and foundries, their file sizes are much smaller as well, so I
  am assuming that I must be doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nAny tips?\r\n\r\nTHANKS
  in advance!"

    is saving at 1.4 megs).  \r\n\r\nAlso, in case this might help, I drew everything
    in Illustrator and brought it into FLS from there."

  body: "1.4 megs for 189 characters is pretty insane. I would just open a support
    ticket with Fontlab and send them the fonts to see what\u2019s taking up all that
    space.\r\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t read the font generation chapter of the Fontlab
    manual, that would also be a good idea. You might just be missing something obvious."

    again and then open a trouble ticket if I can't figure it out, thanks for the
    suggestions!!

    - That's definitely the problem.\r\n\r\nI think you should try optimizing the
    glyphs - you've obviously got WAY to many nodes per glyph. If it's a pretty distressed
    face anyway a little (or a lot) simplification won't make that much difference.\r\n\r\nYou
    can do a global optimize to start, then open each glyph and remove even more nodes
    manually until you get a manageable file size.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
