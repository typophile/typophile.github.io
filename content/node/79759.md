  like the text has been crammed in on the page, as in the book alice suddenly grows
  9 feet high and finds herself getting crammed in the hallway. I am having trouble
  putting this across digitally, i have been working on something (below) but i dislike
  it as i feel it's slightly illegible and doesn't really get my point across. I was
  wondering if anyone can give me some tips on this as i feel that it's looking a
  bit shitty atm and i have to take this to my lecturer on tues.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://s750.photobucket.com/albums/xx145/sl_jones/?action=view&amp;current=Picture10.png\"

  body: "is it an option to change the font size for some of the rows? if so, that
    will help with the consistency (per row) when reading it. another suggestion is
    to have the lines 'fit' within each other better. right now it looks a bit alphabets
    soup-ish. there is no flow as your design stands right now. one example that comes
    to mind that i'm thinking of is a poster designed by paula scher: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_uNMNLJmJwfw/TUOgyxRom-I/AAAAAAAABT4/2QrIsvE15b8/s1600/medium_paula_scher_htl.gif\r\nhope
    these suggestions help a bit. please post what you end up doing. good luck!\r\nnikki

    and the margins, without bouncing the type.\r\nCheck out page 2 and especially
    page 3 of <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Artefact.pdf\">this</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
