body: Are there any online communities for book designers? By which I don't mean cover
  designers, which you generally get when googling the subject. I produce 'trad' books,
  ie (so far anyway) consisting of text / line art / plates. I don't see this subject
  much represented here, or people are keeping it to themselves! Being an amateur
  working solo by moonlight it would be good to compare notes / share ideas & experiences
  with others.

  body: "Hello Dick,\r\nI like to believe that Typophile is not about type design
    only, but about all things typographic (and even beyond), which definitely includes
    book design. There are quite a few book designers on Typophile, and you can <a
    href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com/node/%20%22book%20design%22\">find
    many threads</a> that focus on various aspects of book design, from rather mundane
    and technical, to downright philosophical. I\u2019d like to encourage you to start
    your own threads on the things you wish to discuss, here on Typophile. There is
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forums\">no special forum</a> dedicated to book
    design yet, but that can be changed, if enough people think that this is necessary. "

  body: I hear you about LinkedIn and Facebook, but they serve certain niche areas
    of my life and I tend to engage in social media just about only when I'm working.
    I'll keep them handy on the second monitor in case I'm working at an odd hour
    and need the sense that there are other humans around at that particular hour.
    As for book design people to speak with, it's true that a good many can be found
    on Typophile when a thread raises them. And you'll find them in various publishing-related
    Yahoo Groups, on a number of freelancers forums, as well as in LinkedIn groups.
    I occasionally get some, tho' nowhere near as many as I'd like, commenting on
    my blog about book design. I think it's all about putting together the best combo
    of connections in as many places online as possible for running into those kinds
    of discussions.

  body: Thanks Florian & Steve for taking the trouble to persuade me. My comment re
    LinkedIn & Facebook came across maybe more scathing than intended! Perhaps book
    designers are in the minority of type users, and that may explain why the subject
    has less representation here than I expected. But I'll hang about and chip in
    what I can here, also it's good to find your blog Steve. I suppose I'm a bit odd
    in not being a designer by trade but a one-man-band publisher whose resources
    mandate a DIY approach to design, which I have always had an interest in. I'm
    interested in trends in short-run book production & fairly direct marketing also,
    as I believe these represent the future of non-mass-market publishing given the
    way the book trade has gone in recent years.

  body: "Well, I'll say this, Dick, a lot of DIY books look it. And that leads to
    a kind of vicious cycle, as--unless the book is to a sort of \"captive audience,\"
    like students needing a particular textbook--potential readers become less and
    less willing to part with their hard-to-come-by dollars. So book design really
    matters, in my estimation.\r\n\r\nIf you start a group for book designers somewhere,
    please let me know."

  body: I'm with you there Steve; the availability of software and now POD has cluttered
    the world with a lot of junk. The financial barrier to conventional volume production
    for trade sale, as with all forms of 'recorded' media, ensures a measure of editorial
    control, although you have to wonder about that sometimes lately. I'm in between
    those extremes - I sell mainly direct, but having to print a minimum of 100 to
    get the physical quality I'm after keeps me focussed on the merits and look of
    the material to be sure, as that expenditure is big for me. I have used POD for
    club work in the past where the original material was rough to begin with and
    so the results acceptable, but on cost and quality grounds, and because of the
    lack of available detailing, I wouldn't use it for my own projects.

  body: Hi there, I've been designing books for a small local publishing house in
    the very last years. I proposed myself after seeing some very poor quality laying
    around and, as a typography and book lover, I've been conceited enough to think
    that even a small publisher deserves a good look. That also gave me the chance
    to buy and use some great contemporary fonts - from Sumner Stone's Cycles and
    Magma to Kent Lew's Whitman, from Type Together's Athelas to Robert Slimbach's
    Adobe Garamond, and more. It's a very limited experience, not "professional" in
    the very strict sense of the word (I'm a journalist and self made designer), but
    I have the presumption to think that, in the end, the looks of their book has
    improved. Now I'm also editing, and typesetting as well, a series of books, mainly
    out of print / copyright free stuff. As for the matter of (digital) print on demand
    versus offset printing, I think that the greater quality difference is in the
    binding - sewing is still much better than milling. There are some other people
    in Typophile involved in book design - Charles Ellertson and Kent Lew come to
    mind.

  body: "Hi Nicola, You're right that binding is generally where POD falls down. There
    is a 'middle way' between 'milled' (is that what some call 'perfect'?) and sewn
    binding, namely so-called slotted or 'burst' binding, where the pages are assembled
    in folded signatures, but instead of being sewn, saw-cuts are made across the
    spines of the signatures and some sort of heated plastic or glue is injected.
    This is probably stronger than sewn, will not come apart or go slack in use, but
    of course will not quite lay open and flat as a sewn book will (so I don't do
    cook-books and car repair manuals...) and cannot be re-bound, not that I can see
    this ever being needed. It's all a compromise.\r\n\r\nMy excellent digital printer
    in the UK (min run is 100 but will reprint down to 50) offers this as standard,
    but will sew on request at an additional cost of about 1-2 GBP per copy. My material
    does not really merit the expense of sewing, as this would up the selling price
    by somewhat more than the extra cost if I am being businesslike. But 'slotted'
    is a better binding than the perfect type which most trade hardcover books seem
    to get these days, often concealed with a head & tail band. The other goodies
    which you don't generally get with POD are printed endpapers, front cover blocking,
    sections of plates, etc., and of course proper rounding and backing of the spine,
    all of which I use and like, as do my trad-minded customers (I reissue neglected
    writers in the field of traditional sail).\r\n\r\nMy printer is called [[http://www.biddles.co.uk|Biddles]],
    and beside them being very competitive price-wise, their materials and quality
    are quite superb (they are an old-established company) and they have the most
    incredible DIY online estimating and job-submission system which handles all of
    those options you might need, and saves a huge amount of time as you adjust details
    and recalculate the cost. And they also do litho using the same materials and
    binding line, in case one of my titles 'takes off' (hasn't happened yet though).\r\n\r\nBut
    digital printing technology is changing rapidly and I have to stay aware of their
    'plant list', as which machine they use depends on the page size, and at larger
    sizes (where they use new Kodak 'Prosper' inkjet technology) I have found the
    black density is a bit washed-out compared to the smaller formats (Nipson Varypress
    laser technology, nice & dense text). Also at larger sizes they use so-called
    'PUR' binding, which is an absolutely bulletproof (but I suspect non-recyclable)
    single-page binding involving a flexible poly-something-or-other membrane holding
    the pages together. I'm less hung-up about that than I thought I would be, having
    had a couple of books done with it, I tend to use head & tail bands on larger
    sizes, so no-one would ever really know.\r\n\r\nIt's inevitable that sewn binding
    for short runs will soon be unavailable except at the 'collector' end of the market,
    where I don't operate (as far as I know, anyway, although one dealer did advertise
    one of my titles at 6 times the original price, before realising it was -- and
    is -- still available from me).\r\n\r\nAnother inevitability about short-run digital
    is, the letterforms are almost too smooth & perfect, and the paper too smooth.
    I miss that 'earthy' almost 3-D feel you get with old letterpress books, even
    in ordinary trade editions.\r\n\r\nI liked your thread on nice books you own,
    I'm not sure I own anything in that league, but will see what I can find. I have
    a soft spot for nicely done ordinary trade books.\r\n\r\nPS - Sorry this was so
    long!"

  body: "I've been setting books (only) for 30+ years, and designing, occasionally,
    for most of that time. I can sum up what I've learned in a few paragraphs. Here's
    the short form. Your mileage may vary. \r\n\r\nYou can only judge a book typeface
    by looking at ink on paper. The method used to get the ink on paper matters a
    lot. The particular paper matters a lot.\r\n\r\nI'm less concerned with letter
    forms -- within reason -- than with space. All spaces interact. Fashions come
    and go (e.g. we're into using a lot of leading now), but the interaction of space
    remains a constant.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of these. character fit, usually lies
    outside the control of the designer, and all to often, the typesetter. Learn how
    to take control. Write a good kerning program. That's several days initial work,
    corrected when you see books printed at 2400 dpi, offset, direct to plate (if
    that's how the books you work on are printed). Character fit lets you have more
    control over the word boundaries. Pay special attention to punctuation, type designers
    screw this up by the numbers. As the look of the line improves, so will the leading.
    You will find that more than one leading value works well. Etc.\r\n\r\nConsider
    the audience. Designing a book is no place for what *you* like. If you want to
    favor what you like, write your own book. People too often equate book interior
    design to architecture. Well, there is that element. But don't forget a more humble
    comparison, a theatrical set designer. The egos of of a whole lot of people have
    to be served with set design, as well as the interests of the playwright and audience.\r\n\r\nThe
    best books on book design are descriptive, not prescriptive. My favorite is the
    <cite>Art of the Printed Book, 1455-1955</cite>. Figure out why particular books
    were selected. (hint: it isn't particularly for the typefaces chosen). Rich Hendel's
    <cite>On Book Design</cite> is good. Rich has a second book forthcoming. Shameless
    plug, I admire Rich, and have a chapter in the new book, as does Kent Lew.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to be a long, slow process, learning good interior design. Cover design
    is a whole different matter, and perhaps more satisfying for a number of people.
    Different talents required."
