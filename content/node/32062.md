body: "I have a new client that needs a logo with a 'M' as the logo sign. He wants
  the M to later stand alone, or be used in combination with different keywords that
  describe his company. His business is as an event company on a very high level so
  the logo needs to be elegant and have class. \r\nI have made these rough sketches
  for him and he likes it a lot. The only problem he has with the logo is that the
  M is not legible enough. I didn't want to use a font, tweak the M and make a logo
  out of it. So I hand lettered it to give it that exclusive touch. \r\n\r\nI'd like
  to make some more complete logos for him, but I'm looking for some inspiration.
  Do you know of a logo that has a really really nice M as a sign? Some keywords that
  the logo should match up to are: serious, professional, masculine, elegant and powerfull.\r\n\r\nWould
  be nice to see what you come up with...\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

    the entrances to the Paris metro he designed are shaped as an M.\r\nhttp://www.parisinconnu.com/guimard/l12p1.php\r\n\r\nHe
