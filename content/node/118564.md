  I've been putting it on and off and I'm hoping to finish it by the end of the year.
  Right now all I have is lowercase and will eventually work my way to numbers and
  glyphs. \r\n\r\nI'll gladly appreciate any feedback and criticism.\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n<img

    body: Yeah, I agree. I can't really seem to find a solution to make it fit more
      with the rest. Any suggestions?
