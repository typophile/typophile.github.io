  The line \"Indoor Multi-Purpose\" will change for each award category. Because of
  the shape of the A and B I had to optically center the type and the line beneath.
  I've been staring at this too long and could use some fresh eyes. Does the type
  look centered and balanced? Other suggestions/comments are welcome as well.\r\n\r\nThanks,
  your feedback will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/laurelaward_4748.gif]"

  body: I'd consider making a ligature of the AB combination, as they already almost
    touch. I'd say that SA is more than a touch to close. Agree on the colours.

  body: "Thanks everyone. I adjusted the SA spacing. Also changed the \"Indoor...\"
    to black. I had originally tried it in the laurel green but there wasn't enough
    contrast and it got lost.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/laurelawardbig_r1_3462.gif]"
