body: The other day, I saw what appeared to be &#40;from a distance&#41; an attractively-designed
  brochure for Ace Hardware paint. Upon closer inspection, however, I was aghast.
  It appears the designer created their own script font that looks OK except that
  the &#39;t&#39; and &#39;i&#39; in the word &#34;generations&#34; do not correctly
  connect. There was a similar problem with their other brochure. Why couldn&#39;t
  they have just used something like Edwardian Script and be done with it?  <BR> <BR>

  body: ' Doesn&#39;t look quite like Carpenter, Stephen. Look closely at the &#39;n&#39;
    and the &#39;i&#39;. Very different entry strokes. I doubt the designer changed
    them -- why bother? But aren&#39;t there a couple fonts out there similar to Carpenter?
    I seem to remember Letraset had one. Anyway, if this is a cheap knock-off, then
    the fitting is probably in the font, rather than a misfired kern on the designer&#39;s
    part.  <BR> <BR>-- K. '

    to bring it into Illustrator and tweak it until it fit, even if the font itself
    was hosed? '
