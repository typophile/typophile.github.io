body: "Does anyone remember a specimen in the ATypI type gallery (long hallway) that
  showed an experimental set of size-specific designs for type to be used at extremely
  small sizes (2-6 point)? It is a very intriguing exploration of optical effects
  for legibility, and would be useful to track in our discussions of that topic. It
  was on the left wall as you walked toward the big auditorium, closer to the entrance.
  I seem to recall it had a name like fovea or cornea, something to do with the eye....
  Not Retina, I know of that already. Memories? \r\n"

  body: That's the one. Have you seen the smaller variants? It's necessary to see
    them in print.
