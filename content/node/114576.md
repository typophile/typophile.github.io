  2003 are displayed as follow:\r\n\r\nTimes Regular\r\nTimes Italic\r\nTimes Bold\r\nTimes
  Bold Italic\r\n\r\nI would like to edit the font files so that in the font menu
  they are displayed as a single line \"Times\".\r\nPicking \"Times\" from the menu
  I should get Regular.\r\nItalic, Bold and Bold Italic should be activated via the
  correspondent button in the toolbar.\r\n\r\nI've already installed TTX and I have
  concerted the OTF files to XML. What lines should I edit to get what I want?\r\n\r\nThank
  you\r\n\r\n"

    the pages you've linked: they are really interesting...\r\n\r\nI have another
    question for you. I've just found a software that promises to solve my \"font
    style linking\" issue through a gui: [[http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/|TransType
    4]]. It's not cheap but it could be very practical for my needs...\r\n\r\nIs there
    any problem with using TranType 4 to link font styles? Is there any reason I should
    use TTX instead?\r\n\r\nManosk\r\n"

  body: "Michel: <em>\u2018I see that FontForge adjusts those bits automatically.\u2019</em>\r\n\r\nRemains
    the question whether what FF automatically does with this bits is what you want
    it to do. In case of the four styles/weights in question this will be no problem,
    I reckon. But working with FF requires decompilation of the fonts to FF\u2019s
    internal format, which is not the case with TTX or DTL OTMaster (OTM). Depending
    on the (quality of the) program used for the conversion of .ttf to .otf (is that
    allowed anyway?) that could be considered a disadvantage or an advantage though.\r\n\r\nMy
    advise is to \uFB01rst check the consistency of the font naming and style bits
    with the free <em>Light</em> version of OTM, which can be downloaded from the
    <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/\">FM website</a>.\r\n\r\nFEB"

    table, but the <em>Consistency Checker</em> (\u2018Tools\u2019 menu) is quite
    convenient IMHO:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_Light_20_6516.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe

    my opinion, to properly display the relevant information, some very basic python
    code using the fonttools would be preferable. Just to read the fsSelection bits,
    here is some code that assumes that AFDKO is installed; just copy the lines between
    the cut lines and paste them in a terminal window (on the macintosh).\r\n<pre>\r\n----
    cut line\r\nTTX=`which AFDKOPython`\r\nTTXF=`dirname $TTX`\r\ncat > ${TTXF}/fssel
    <<'EOF'\r\n#!/usr/bin/env AFDKOPython\r\n\r\nfrom fontTools.ttLib import TTFont\r\nimport
    sys\r\nfsbits = {0x001:'Italic',\r\n          0x002:'Underscore',\r\n          0x004:'Reverse
    video',\r\n          0x008:'Outlined',\r\n          0x010:'Striked out',\r\n          0x020:'Bold',\r\n

    \         0x100:'WWW',\r\n          0x200:'Oblique'}\r\n\r\nf=TTFont(sys.argv[1])\r\nfs
    = f[\"OS/2\"].fsSelection\r\nprint \"The fsSelection bits say:\"\r\nfor bit in
    fsbits:\r\n  if fs & bit:\r\n    print \"     \", fsbits[bit]\r\nEOF\r\nchmod
    755 ${TTXF}/fssel\r\n---- cut line\r\n</PRE>\r\nThat saves an executable called
    <code>fssel</code> in your path. Now, here is a trace of execution on the same
    file as the grab above:\r\n<pre>\r\n----\r\n605 % fssel /Library/Fonts/ArnoPro-BoldItalic.otf\r\nThe
    fsSelection bits say:\r\n      Italic\r\n      Bold\r\n      Use Windows spacing
    metrics\r\n----\r\n</PRE>\r\nSlightly more readable, no?\r\n"
