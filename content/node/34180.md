  face used for \"Parkland\" (please see attached image). I suspect it's been tinkered
  with. I'm midway through a small job and I'm having trouble identifying its maker.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is greatly appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Parkland_5312.gif]"

      it may not be possible.) I suspect it's a modified oldstyle, and yet it has
      a retro feel. Look at that \"A\". Thoughts?\r\n\r\n"

    body: Yes, it's a Sun Gro product. However, I believe the packaging is from the
      US. Thoughts?

    had a look at their <a href=\"http://www.sungro.com/products.php\">website</a>
    and they have a number of brands that seem to use the same font for BlackGold
    and AlbertaRose, if those other logos are any help, Mike....  "

    Is there another site that might show the Parkland line?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It's strange that they don't even list "Parkland" on their website, but a
    directory listing peat moss producers lists Parkland as belonging to Sun Gro.  Other
    than that, I'm drawing a blank.

    the best I could find was either <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/algerian/\">Algerian</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/waterloo-bold/\">Waterloo</a>
    -- neither of which is close at all.\r\n\r\nIt seems most likely then that they
    modified the A on a rather conventional font to produce a logo for PARKLAND, which
    doesn't seem to be a brand they mention any more on their site.\r\n\r\n- Mike
