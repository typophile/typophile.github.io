		<div class="commentbody"> The definition I&#39;m finding for &#34;entasis&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to work for that. The action is called &#34;hanging&#34; the glyph over the margin, and the more a glyph&#39;s &#34;optical weight&#34; is away from its absolute boundaries, the more it&#39;s necessary. In the case of quotes &#40;which are small and very off-center&#41; it&#39;s common practice to hang them. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s interesting is that -technically- this problem is a hold-over from the metal days, when glyphs were necessarily confined to a rectangle &#40;except for the occasional physical kern: a protrusion outside the base block, like sometimes in the beak of the lc &#34;f&#34;&#41;. Now with digital type and the easy availability of kerning, it&#39;s possible to adopt a very different spacing scheme, one that allows everything to hang out &#40;thus inherently accounting for optical weight&#41;, and relying absolutely on &#40;positive&#41; kerning to fix any collisions. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, virtually nobody does this, because: <BR>1. Type design is a conservative field &#40;even after the hooliganism of the 90s&#41;. <BR>2. It&#39;s more work: you need a ton more kerning. <BR>3. The user must have kerning enabled, otherwise the setting will look like a freeway pile-up. <BR> <BR>The good news is that automatic kerning routines &#40;or perhaps &#91;an evolution of&#93; InDesign&#39;s optical spacing algorithm&#41; might make this a reality. Result: totally straight margins. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Hrant, my English is not quite good enough, but I will try anyway: when I was asking for an English equivalent to the idea of &#39;entasis&#39; I was asking for a broader term than &#39;hanging punctuation&#39;. Because the way we use &#39;entasis&#39; in Danish, &#39;hanging punctuation&#39; is only &#42;one&#42; type of &#39;entasis&#39;. Others are &#39;baseline overhang&#39; ... the fact that an UC &#39;O&#39; is wider than an UC &#39;H&#39; ... the fact that columns in Greek temples are thicker in the middle to appear straight ... <BR> <BR>In other words, &#39;entasis&#39; is the conception of &#39;helping &#34;less&#34; to look &#34;the same&#34; by turning it into &#34;more&#34;&#39;. <BR> <BR>So, if  &#39;Ford&#39; and &#39;Volvo&#39; are &#39;hanging punctuation&#39; and  &#39;baseline overhang&#39; ... what is &#39;car&#39;? <BR> <BR>Soren O </div>
