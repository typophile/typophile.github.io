  body: Perhaps then you could illustrate droplets of blue water at the base of the
    right leaf. To give that reference. And lose the gradient. <BR> <BR>I have a bias
    against gradients in logos.  <BR> <BR>Love the type used, but there is a shift
    in the weights. <BR> <BR>Lose the sun logo. <BR>good luck!

  body: I&#39;d say the blue circle doesn&#39;t hint at hydroponics either. I agree
    with Kumbuniko...perhaps incorporate a droplet into the image. Remember, less
    is more...you don&#39;t need the extra horizontal rules or the gradients or the
    outlines. simplify, simplify, simplify! ;o&#41;

  body: 'I agree with the others. Ditch the gradient, less is more, use some water
    droplets. I like the funky Art Nouveau font the most. <BR> <BR>You seem to have
    two visual/conceptual threads that aren&#39;t weaving together smoothly: 1&#41;
    modern, clean, simple; 2&#41; funky, friendly, perhaps homegrown. I&#39;d choose
    one and run with it. <BR> <BR>If hydroponics are important to the client, then
    focus on what that means: growing in a water/nutrient solution rather than dirt,
    i.e. plants from water. That could generate some interesting visuals right there.'

  body: Or perhaps what would be good is to separate and explore the two concepts
    individually.

  body: I think this is definitely an Art Nouveau project. And the letterforms are
    rich enough in that genre that gradients can only take away from it. <BR> <BR>Can
    you make two leaves that look like &#34;A&#34; and &#34;F&#34;? &#40;Sorry, I&#39;m
    sounding like a dumb client now...&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp
