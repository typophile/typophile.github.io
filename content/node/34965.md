  Intel Processor inside. Is there someone with experiences?\r\nI am using a FontLab
  version 5.01 for Macintosh on my G4 at this moment. \r\nAre their any problems known
  installing or using it with a MacBook? For the guys in the shops\r\nknow little
  about it and told me that there could be problems with older programs originally\r\ndesigned
  for the original Mac processors. There might be the need for more working memory
  and so on.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nStefan"
