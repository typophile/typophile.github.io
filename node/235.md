  body: 'I really don&#39;t know if this is an existing typeface: it  <BR>looks very
    much like some custom lettering to me. <BR> <BR>What is it with everyone wanting
    to ID sports logos  <BR>these days? Did I miss something? Most of that stuff  <BR>is
    custom or highly customized anyways. It makes us  <BR>look bad, as if we can&#39;t
    ID anything. ;P'

  body: My excuse is that I work for a athletic wear company. Our clients always want
    to look like the pros. This helps us do just that. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right.
    A lot of it is custom artwork, or fonts that are then customized. But don&#39;t
    worry we know exactly how good you really are. Besides, what fun would &#39;name-that-typeface&#39;
    be if it was always easy.<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
