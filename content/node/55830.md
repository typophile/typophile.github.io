  body: "I did what I suggested and found a few that were very similar. Closest in
    shape was [[http://www.dafont.com/typesource-extol.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Super+Auto+Care|Typesource
    Extol]] by Aenigma. It looks like a heavier version of a very close font to your
    sample. Square off the u on the left side, and you're there, if this was a lighter
    weight. Maybe another of their fonts (perhaps not a freebie) would be a better
    match.\r\n\r\nThe other font I thought was similar was [[http://www.dafont.com/black-wolf.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Super+Auto+Care|Black
    Wolf]] from GreyWolf Webworks.\r\n\r\nThese might give you a place to start.\r\n\r\n\r\n-
