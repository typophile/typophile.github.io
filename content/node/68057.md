  terminals from Clarendon I decided to ask the Typophile community if any of you
  can suggest a slab similar to Clarendon without ball terminals.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I am a designer, and over the past 2 years I have created several typefaces
    (Latin 9). I have done this at my salaried job. I also do freelance design and
    have recently been asked to give someone a quote for a Latin 9 San-serif character
    set. Does anyone out there have a general pricing guide they use for freelance
    type design?

  body: Thanks Stephen, Giza looks great. Also trying Aachen but the serifs are a
    little to stubby.

    up something."
