    there are tons of examples of companies who got it right.

  body: "The first font used on the side emblem of the car is a bit horsey. Sort of
    fat and not very \"luxurious\". The font on the emblem on the inside of the car
    (quite possibly the same font, but kerned out a bit and used in small caps) seems
    more luxurious and a bit more suitable for such an application. I think the typography
    in the second image applied to the first would have been a much nicer treatment
    for the emblem design of a $50k car.\r\n\r\nIMHO.\r\n\r\n/mattjohn"

    far worse than the type applied in the examples above. More like the kind of logo
    you would expect to find on a budget car radio.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lexus_logo_4167.png]"

  body: "What appears inside the car is the logo and logotype for the golf course
    and resort. Something that was probably not designed to be used as a special edition
    luxury car logo, but instead to evoke certain emotions related to the golf course\u2014which
    I think it does rather successfully. I'm guessing then that the exterior badge
    was intended to look similar to the Pebble Beach logotype, except they failed
    at that. If the exterior tag was properly set like the logotype, I'd have no real
    problem with it (typographically at least)."

  body: "Not that I disagree, but it would appear this type treatment was set by those
    that branded Pebble Beach the golf course/resort. Since that branding is pretty
    much set,  I think it is more of a failure to integrate the logo into an appropriate
    carrier. \r\n\r\nJac\r\n<em>\"pronounced by saying 'Jake' without conjuring imagery

    like its a \"fail\" all around.  Another door badge from another lexus is different.
    \ Looks like they are not even consistent with their mistakes.  Still does not
    match Pebble Beach Resorts logo.  The embroidery on the mats should have been
    done differently.  Another \"fail\""
