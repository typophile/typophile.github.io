  your typical strict geometric sans...\r\nI wanted something that melded together
  Century Bold, Futura Medium, and your typical bold/medium grotesk, something like
  Helvetica Bold.  I wanted the geometry to be something a bit \"dumbed\" down rather
  than strictly machined, but retain a sense of craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nAs I said this
  is my first attempt at something other than a geometric sans, and was drawn in illustrator(haven't
  quite been able to figure out fontlab's drawing system...) and want to try and iron
  out as much as possible before I begin to import the characters.  \r\n\r\nPlease
  any suggestions at all are welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"
