body: I am helping a friend clean up his logo. The biggest issue is the type. I want
  to keep the font similar because they like it but there are a bunch of issues with
  the spacing and the weight of the letters. The A is much thicker than the rest.
  Any help with the exact font of something similar would be great. Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4945.png]

  body: I think it might be Teuton or Galette italicized. But the letters aren't as
    round on the left edge.
