  Everyone,\r\nI recently found a book called Advertising Now. Print. It uses the
  nicest stencil typeface I've ever seen but I have searched everywhere and can't
  find where to buy it.\r\n\r\nThe book is here:\r\nhttp://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/books/popculture/new/facts/03393.htm\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy"
