  as accurate as possible reproduction of the font(s) used on this WWII watch face.\r\n\r\nThe
  Watch is a A-11 style that was made during WWII by companies such as Elgin, Bulova
  and Waltham - The picture is attached to this message\r\n\r\nObviously the pigment
  used on the dial has added some character to the numbers - hopefully someone on
  this forum will be able to direct me to the typeface used or at least one which
  is very close. many thanks"
