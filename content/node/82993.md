body: "Hi,\r\nI have found a very interesting case which might be interesting.\r\nThere
  is a free font which is based I gues on one of Berthold's fonts. One of graphic
  designers from Poland is claiming to design a new typeface as his Ph. D. thesis.[[http://translate.google.pl/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=pl&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=pl&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polskalitera.pl%2F&act=url]]\r\nLooking
  at the project closely it seems to be a modified copy of Berthold's font  - Laudatio
  BQ Light designed by Friedrich Poppl.\r\n\r\nThere is a big discussion on Polish
  graphic designes blog. [[http://translate.google.pl/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=pl&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=pl&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fstgu.pl%2F2011%2F05%2Fapolonia-czy-arogancja%2F&act=url]]\r\nIs
  it original or a copy? What is your opinion?"

  body: There are some clear differences between the two, and in many cases I'm not
    sure I don't prefer Apolonia's treatment, so I certainly wouldn't simply dismiss
    it as a copy.  To what extent inspiration was drawn from Laudatio I'm not sure,
    nor am I familiar with the particular university's precise requirements around
    original work in a PhD, but I certainly see it as a different design with merit
    which goes beyond Laudatio.
