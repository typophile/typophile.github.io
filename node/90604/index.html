consulting, but you don&rsquo;t want a type designer actually
making the final decision; for that you need an alphabet
designer. Those are pretty rare though.  :-)</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I think slanting the bars was an improvement,
since it balances the symbol better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has also been criticized by some to be the

</blockquote>
<p>If that&rsquo;s a coincidence, that&rsquo;s not so bad. If that&rsquo;s a
ruse to get Europeans to like Turkey more, that&rsquo;s not
good (simply because deceit backfires in the end).
If it&rsquo;s a genuine nod towards the need for honesty
in dealing with the Armenian Genocide (unlikely) then
that&rsquo;s awesome - just as impressive as the April 24th
demonstration held in Istanbul last year.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m Armenian, the one thing I like about
the symbol is its gentle allusion of the Arabic past of
Turkish writing.</p>
<p>Looking at the 7 finalists, I would have put my
money on the middle one, since it does the most
to make Turkey look Western. But I still prefer
the one they ended up with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>taken a British pound sign</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!
Turkey is not part of the British Isles.
Lucky for Turkey.</p>

<p>At the very least.
As someone who will be required to adapt the new character to many different kinds of font, a type designer would, one hopes, address the issues of scalability, slant, weight variance and screen rendering — and make sure that the design brief requires each entrant to show specimen glyphs of how their proposed symbol would look in a variety of typefaces, styles, and media. Not just Univers 45 or whatever.</p>

<p>It won’t matter. For the average user it will not be appealing, such niceties. It won’t help the “new logo” arriving in reality.
As long as they don’t sort out this business in terms of the existing LIRA sign, it seems all fairly rediculous to me. To pretend as if “a new sign for the turkish Lira” would have been something to invent at all, this is the initial mistake. And the story goes downhill from than on.</p>

<p>Neither is Italy. But if Britain gets one bar, Italy two bars, and Turkey three, Turkey would still get its own codepoint.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the relation to the Armenian dram sign <em>is</em> a coincidence. But possibly one so embarassing to Turkey that it will choose something else. Noting the finalists shown, it does seem that instead of being inspired by symbols for the lira and the pound, the chief goal in those submissions was to reflect the letters T and L. In the Latin script, which, of course, Turkey now uses.</p>
<p>I suppose using the Arabic script as a source of inspiration is right out for political reasons.

The fact that both the Italian and Turkish currency units are called lira is beside the point: they are not the same currency, and the symbol represents the currency, not the name of the currency. Different countries may use the same currency symbol to represent different currencies &ndash; e.g. $ which is dollar in some countries and peso in others &ndash;, and other countries may use the same names but different symbols (I can&rsquo;t think of one off hand).</div>

<p>What’s that other than 20A4?</p>
<p>The artificially “designed” symbol of the azerbaidshan currency Manat has been just recently rejected for encoding by ISO, because it was not shown in usage.

<p>While I can support the <em>sentiment</em>, since pride and vanity are exaggerated in the types of autocratic government I dislike, it&rsquo;s not particularly unusual for any given country to have a distinctive symbol for its currency unit. Many do; others, in the past, have declined to do so because of economic factors.</p>
<p>Now that type doesn&rsquo;t have to be molded from metal, now that it is &ldquo;soft&rdquo;, so that a new character which would obsolete a manual typewriter places no one&rsquo;s laser printer in jeopardy - poorer countries, which had to make do with hand-me-down type from other nations want their own symbols finally for their currencies.</p>
<p>This to me isn&rsquo;t the destructive evil pride of some preening militarist - rather, it is the desperate pride of those who struggle to maintain dignity while in poverty. That&rsquo;s something I am inclined to support rather than deprecate.</p>

I gave a <a href="http://bit.ly/DEU-GBF11-Segalini-results">workshop</a> last year at a state university to push the students to think of that missing character as well as of other issues in the Turkish alphabet.
The slanted crossbar is a left “classic” to me since I noticed it in the <a href="http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/">paper</a>.
Just like Gunnar, I do think that “design contests are usually a bad idea and a designer working back and forth with the commissioning agency might have dealt with a lot of questions including different serif variations before the grand announcement.”
The image that Serdar posted is from this <a href="http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/duyuru/2012/TL_web.pdf">.pdf</a> – I didn’t expect to find the “altın oran” there, it is silly.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>desperate pride of those who struggle to maintain dignity while in poverty</p>

<p>I have great respect for Turkish pride. And nowadays the Turkish nation is not that terribly poor and desperate as you might want to suggest. As a matter of fact, Turkey is a rather successful nation with a growing population. So far so good.</p>
<p>But all this is rather not at stake here. The presented “design” is based on a mental mistake (like it was with the official Euro sign) and therefore it will undergo substantial transformation or it will vanish.
The mistake is that the proposed glyph is meant “to look like a piece of design”, rather than to look like a natural currency character.</p>
<p>Pride or prejustice, that is the question.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can always go and furnish 20A4 with any glyph you like. 
To my knowlegde there are only two countries with Lira left today, Turkey and Syria. But for Syria as an Arabic writing country the slot 20A4 is of no interest. So in fact, the point is finally left for Turkish conquest ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, I think you&rsquo;re painting an overly negative picture.
I wouldn&rsquo;t talk about desperation in the context of Europe
currently&hellip; Somebody said Euro?</p>
<p>Ayse, maybe your expectations are too high? This is after all
a politico-bureaucratic thing. Or maybe you wanted something
more European, less religious? The shape of such a currency
symbol might improve outside views of Turkey in the short
term, but all that would do is delay an honest resolution of real
differences, which have to be overcome internally first. To
me alluding to the long and glorious Arabic past of Turkish
writing can only help. You don&rsquo;t have to be religious (I&rsquo;m not)
to believe that.</p>
<p>Also, I would not rely on handwriting, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re going to get regional variations, plus even in a
given region it&rsquo;s going to take a while for it to stabilize.
You don&rsquo;t want to wait a couple of decades just to settle on a
final country-wide symbol, especially since it could be <em>worse</em>.</li>
<li>Whatever casual handwriting produces is only elegantly
typographic by dumb luck; the typeform derived from such
a model would probably be either ugly or highly divergent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alessandro, what&rsquo;s &ldquo;altın oran&rdquo;?
BTW, I&rsquo;m feeling a panel discussion about this at ISType 2012
coming on. :-)  I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out a way to make it BTW.
If I can swing a Moscow connection for my Armenia trip the cost
of a detour to Istanbul seems to be pretty modest. But the timing
still has to click just right.</p>
<p>Andreas, national pride can be quite important&hellip; but mostly
for endangered peoples. In the hands of dominant people it&rsquo;s
sadly mostly used to get the populace to behave contrary to
its own good, as happened during WWI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>therefore it will undergo substantial
transformation or it will vanish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s not what I feel happened
to the Euro. What we see in type is clearly a rendering
of the original idea. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter that the
original idea was intended* to be implemented strictly.
And that actually has its place too, like as decoration
on buildings. In fact it&rsquo;s better to start with something
formal and let people deviate; the other way is hopeless.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which I&rsquo;m not sure was the case. There&rsquo;s a
difference between what politicians say versus
what they think should happen. And if they had
said &ldquo;this is just a suggestion of how it should
look&rdquo; <em>then</em> we might have seen some substantial
changes (and you don&rsquo;t want too much deviation).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>you can always go and furnish 20A4 with any glyph you like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overloading that slot would only confuse. That&rsquo;s almost
as bad as re-using the sputnik (the generic currency slot).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Syria as an Arabic writing country the slot 20A4 is of no interest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s an over-simplification - you could be writing about
the Syrian currency in a Latinate language. And if I&rsquo;m not
mistaken the Syrian currency notes have an English side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there any political message in this official announcement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explicitly: unlikely. Implicitly: definitely. :-)
Although it&rsquo;s possible that the Armenian Dram&rsquo;s recent
incorporation into Unicode was a trigger, something like
this would never get off the ground unless there was a
political message. And the only message that seems to
make sense here is &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t really need Europe&rdquo;; and
in that context the new mark pretty much <em>had</em> to have
a non-Latin skew.</p>

<p>Fonts are used to reproduce or render legacy documents, so redrawing a character could be problematic. This is one of the reasons we have Japanese JIS forms for the older designs.</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s to say an out of favor currency may not be revived at some point in the future by a regime looking to evoke a more glorious past. Although a bunch of European currencies had a stake thrust through their hearts with the introduction of the euro, who&rsquo;s to say Count Drachma (for example) won&rsquo;t come back from the grave? :-)</p>

<p>Although the Armenian example has proximity and a particular political significance, I think in general we can thank the Indian government&rsquo;s rupee symbol initiative for this recent fad for inventing and encoding symbols for currencies that have got on perfectly well without them for decades. Both the method (open competition) and the justification for the new Turkish symbol is the same as that employed in India; so too are the problems with the design.</p>

<p>[[http://unicode-inc.blogspot.ca/2012/05/unicode-62-to-support-turkish-lira-sign.html]]</p>
<p>Maybe I clicked on the link to it earlier in this thread, in which case this didn&rsquo;t need to be posted,</p>
<p>(EDIT: It was: Si Daniels' post above.)</p>
<p>or perhaps it came up in a Google search I conducted for other reasons, in which case this might be useful news.</p>
<p>So its code point will be U+20B4, and we can all stop waiting.</p>
<p>EDIT: So now the comments can start about how such a thing can be called &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;. But despite what opinion one might have about Turkey&rsquo;s adoption of a distinctive symbol for their currency, the fact is that once it has been adopted, Turkish computer users, at least, will want to be able to generate it from their keyboards as easily as U.S. computer users produce the dollar sign &ldquo;$&rdquo;, and without a standardized Unicode code point, chaos and inconvenience will result from attempts to satisfy that desire.</p>
<p>Turkey <em>should</em> have been able to just reserve a codepoint before even picking the appearance of the new glyph, in my opinion, so that the moment the winner was announced, standardized implementations could be rolled out without waiting an extra second.</p>

<p>Well, no, it isn&rsquo;t. A glyph variant of U+20A4 is a sign whose underlying encoding is U+20A4. But the Turkish Lira symbol is approved for encoding as U+20BA, and that is the only correct, standard encoding for this sign. Your opinion has nothing to do with this, any more than mine does: it is a matter of text encoding standard.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mess? I&rsquo;m personally seeing the normal birthing pains of a new character; as it matures it will have to decide (via our proxy) what glyphs it can be. And I feel lucky to be in the right place at the right time to witness the thick of it. Sadly I missed the Armenian Dram&rsquo;s formative period (although I think I&rsquo;m OK with the adult it&rsquo;s become).</p>
<blockquote>Will anybody come up to complain?</blockquote>
<p>Well, if John&rsquo;s concern about the <em>inclination of the bars</em> is valid (and I agree that it very well might be) then I would say many Turks will find your proposition offensive (even though you didn&rsquo;t intend it as such). Nationalism permeates everything (even if many Westerners think they&rsquo;re impervious). That said, there&rsquo;s always room for an individual to make a statement, even via a minor glyph in the font he makes; I make a statement with my «հ» every time&hellip; although Sylfaen just obstructed it for most people.  :-)</p>
<p>Also: Fonts being more formal and prestigious, I don&rsquo;t think how people handwrite the Turkish Lira (which is easy enough to write that I don&rsquo;t expect any structure-changing facilitation) will have much of an effect. The people in a position to strongly affect the evolution are the ones choosing the fonts we make (partly based on how our 20BA* looks).</p>

<p>The character will be encoded. No point in arguing about it. Turkey submitted a proposal to encode it, as did I. Mine is [[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4258.pdf|here]].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So far for the ballot, the glyph for the character will be the &ldquo;official&rdquo; one as seen at the top of the page here. Now as you know, [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U20A0.pdf|in the code charts]] the more generic shapes (in this case based more or less on Times) are generally used. Now despite the fact that I had proposed to use one of Craig Eliason&rsquo;s forms in my proposal, the UTC felt that it was too early to know how this would be designed and implemented in OS fonts or other fonts. So I said I would come to this forum and ask the wider community for designs so that se might see what sort of consensus there would be. I see John and Bendy have come up with some. It looks a bit like people are turning a P and lopping off part of its bowl. In a serif font, the real questions are, what to do about the top serif (I followed Craig&rsquo;s), what to do about the horizontals, and what sort of finial should go on the anchor&rsquo;s fluke.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Regarding the top serif, it seems to me the primary relation of the sign is to the <em>L</em> for “Lira”, so the top serif treatment might as well follow that.</p>
<p>I don’t think the starting point for the lower curve should be so much a turned <em>P</em>. Since the official spec derives from the quarter circle, I think you need to look at the “circular” elements in a face, primarily the <em>O</em> — which naturally leads to the <em>D</em>, which is already a half rounded form with a straight left stem. So, I think the lower curve could probably derive from general pattern of the <em>D</em>.</p>
<p>(Obviously, there is usually a close relation between the <em>P</em> and <em>D</em>. So maybe I’m making a trivial distinction, since neither is usable outright.)</p>
<p>Now, what happens with the terminal of the truncation — the anchor fluke — that’s where the interesting design happens. And I expect this element will be the most variable, echoing the more salient aspects of any particular design’s “style.” Will it admit of a ball terminal, for instance? There’s an intriguing question.</p>
<p>I expect the treatment of horizontals will be driven by the proportion of the other elements and the targeted size and display environment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The following didn&rsquo;t turn out as coherent as I could manage, but I hope it will still serve to temper our -commendable- enthusiasm and provide food for thought.</p>
<p>Michael, nice to see you spearheading this. But I&rsquo;m actually surprised that Unicode is proposing to pay attention to what we do &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo;. Is this usual? Is it that they need to figure out what the actual Times-flavored rendering will be in their codepage renderings? That makes sense (but not much beyond that does).</p>
<p>And I have to take issue with the first half of Kent&rsquo;s post. Yes, formal harmony in a set of glyphs is important, but I personally always strive for a character to be itself and basing the TL too closely to existing structures risks shortchanging it (pardon the pun). Also, most currency marks are derived from alphabetic structures, but <em>all</em> currency marks end up abutted to numerals&hellip; So maybe we need to think in terms of [diverging from?] the numerals, which for example traditionally have thick horizontals.</p>
<p>Also, as much as I admire Craig&rsquo;s inventive -and polished- work, I think we need to talk about this in the abstract before we resort to renderings. This is one of the biggest responsibilities that Typophilers can have - let&rsquo;s go slow and tread carefully.</p>

Hrant, what happened was that when the UTC accepted it to put it on the ballot, somebody said we should use the Turkish Bank glyph. I pointed out the hullaballoo which ensued when the ECB said that the euro's glyph should be inviolate. One of the UTC people (reasonably enough) said that it was too early to know how typographers would shake this character out, so they shouldn't pre-empt that discussion by mandating a harmonized glyph (like the one based on Craig's that I used in my proposal). I said, fair enough, I'll go prod the typographers and see what it is that they intend to do.
<p>I would rather see renderings alongside abstraction.</p>
<p>I think we have seen consensus that the top of the vertical bar should have the same serifs as the capital L though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Kent regarding the top serifs: this should refer to the L in the same typeface, in the same way that the treatment of the yen symbol refers to the Y.</p>
<blockquote>I don’t think the starting point for the lower curve should be so much a turned P. Since the official spec derives from the quarter circle, I think you need to look at the “circular” elements in a face, primarily the O — which naturally leads to the D, which is already a half rounded form with a straight left stem. So, I think the lower curve could probably derive from general pattern of the D</blockquote>
<p>I think a <em>turned</em> P &ndash; sic, actually inverted &ndash; would be very wrong. What I did for the Cambria signs was to take the lower right portion of the P bowl and modify it to flow into the serif construction of the bottom of the &lsquo;L&rsquo; stem, i.e. actually making it <em>less</em> round. I think making it more of an arc of a circle is a mistake unless the design of the typeface already includes such forms in some way. Kent suggests referencing the D instead of the P, but in my types the D and the P usually reference each other, and the P is proportionally a better match for the Turkish lira sign.</p>
<p>What I think is important is that the arrangement of stroke modulation in the sign should reflect that of the rest of the typeface, in order to maintain a sense of stability &ndash; surely desirable for a currency &ndash;, and that it makes sense to make use of the same construction as used elsewhere in the design in similar situations of transition from horizontal to vertical bowl segments. Because of the bars extending to the right, I also think it is important to keep the terminal of the upturn quite simple and not too high, with a good amount of clearance between it and the bars without the latter being placed too high on the stem. What I did in Cambria is to optically centre the crossing of the two bars on the vertical stem, and to roughly align the top of the upturn with where the lower bar emerges on the left side of the stem. This seems to me to be the sort of handy rule that suggests a general model.</p>
<p>There will, of course, be plenty of room for more flamboyant designs, as there is for any glyph, especially in display types, but what is needed at this point is a kind of &lsquo;basic construction model&rsquo; that can be applied to as wide a range of styles of type as possible and produce harmonious results that fit well with the other glyphs, especially the numerals. This is the approach that various people took to the euro symbol when it was instroduced:notably Linotype, who had the largest library of fonts in the target market that needed updating, and who produced a euro symbol design guide that we found produced suitable results for all but an idiosyncratic handful of the 500 fonts that we were hired to extend. Indeed, so good was Linotype&rsquo;s basic construction model for the euro symbol that Adam was able to semi-automate the production of new euro symbol glyphs from elements of existing glyphs, which I had only to fine tune. To me it simply makes sense that the best way to ensure that a new sign harmonises with an existing design is to reference the construction of like-elements in that design. It also accords with my belief that once one has established a core set of glyphs with characteristic shapes and constructions, the rest of a typeface should mostly design itself, and my job is careful refinement of proportions and spacing, not endlessly wondering what shape something should be.</p>

<p>Is that publicly available anywhere?</p>
<p>Did you reject a serif terminal at the end of the hook because of overall busyness? Does that stroke truncated at the thick part find any analogues in other glyphs? 
(My first thought of an existing model for that terminal would be capital /G/, but maybe a typical ampersand could offer some guidance.)
Ben reversed the contrast to go thick to thin (which I had floated earlier, too): the consequent pointier terminal might seem less of an oddball. The thick horizontal, as noted, might fit fine with figures like 2/5/7. I found the thick/thick join at the bottom hard to deal with though Ben&rsquo;s is pretty persuasive. With higher contrast typefaces will that still be workable?</p>

<p>What I personally find important right now is the sort of thing John did in his most recent post: try to <em>talk</em> about what the symbol -and its parts- need to be doing. This is parallel to the advantage of performing rough sketches of an idea before actually making things that look final.</p>
<p>Specifically, the biggest question seems to be: assuming &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; contrast, should the bottom be thick or thin? Although it would be OK to go against such a decision in a given case, it&rsquo;s a sort of decision that does have a place, and on a level higher than making glyphs.</p>

<p>Yes, I misspoke — inverted, not turned — thanks.</p>
<p>But I see what you’re saying about the bottom portion of the <em>P</em> instead. Which makes the distinction between <em>D/P</em> more minor.</p>
<p>That said, as I’ve played now with this glyph, I’m moderating my view about this arc. As much as I admire John’s specific solution, in my own explorations along these lines, I keep feeling too close a kinship between the result and the <em>D</em> and less affinity for an underlying <em>L</em>.</p>
<p>This bothers me in the same way that it bothers me that so many Euro designs seem to look more like a <em>C</em> than an uncial <em>E</em>.</p>
<p>John’s approach seems to ameliorate this by flattening the arc and curling the end slightly — yielding something that reminds me more of a gondola prow, perhaps, than an anchor.</p>
<p>But I wonder if there isn’t some way to retain more of the intention of the quarter circle anchor (as misguided as the specific geometry itself might be) while still referencing an underlying <em>L</em>. To that end, I’m thinking that some kind of simple terminal treatment echoing the leg of the <em>L</em>, where possible and appropriate, might help stave off a truncated <em>D</em> feeling.</p>

<p>For argument&rsquo;s sake here&rsquo;s some dissent on that point:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The glyph retains sufficient &ldquo;L-ness&rdquo; regardless of the serif treatment there. What that bilateral serif may do most is not lend &ldquo;L-ness&rdquo; but lend &ldquo;capital-ness&rdquo; to the glyph, but there is no pressing reason to associate the lira symbol with the majuscules, is there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unilateral (to the left) serif treatment at the top makes visual room for the rising crossbars, which the original proposal specifies as longer on the right and higher than many of the serif-topped proposals have them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Settling on the top first may be constraining options as we work out the problems of the other parts of the glyph. The truncated thick stroke at the end of the curve in the John Hudson design perhaps needs some terminal, such as you might find on a /G/, but the busyness of the glyph kept him from using serifs there. Could a different solution on top make serifs possible? If there&rsquo;s no serif on the right side of the stem at the top, the crossbars can be higher and a G-like serif can have more room. At the same time, a unilateral serif means just less ink overall, and less visual clutter with the crossbars right of the stem. And if it is an angled serif on the left, being closer to parallel with the crossbars should also make the glyph less busy. (Though I suppose that angle might vary with the angle [if any] of the ascender serifs in the typeface?)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the whole &lsquo;anchor&rsquo; notion is a red herring. In the press release introducing the symbol, it has all the marks of a post facto interpretation of a design that is clearly based around an uppercase L, a lowercase t &ndash; more on that below &ndash;, and the conventions of other major currency symbols. And this is what it is important to remember: it is a currency symbol among currency symbols, not a pictogram of an anchor. The whole point of the exercise is for the Turks to have a symbol for their currency that takes its place among the other internationally recognised currency symbols, so we&rsquo;d be doing them a disservice if we adopted an approach that makes the sign visually out of synch with other currency symbols and risks exoticisation. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the anchor notion is something to be completely ignored, along with any other external shape correspondences; hence I am neither seeking to make the upturn look like a gondola prow nor fussed if it turns out to suggest that, any more than I care if my uppercase A reminds someone of a Swiss ski chalet. I&rsquo;m designing a sign within a writing system according to the construction of the other signs in that system and the particular typeface design. As Gill might say at this juncture: a currency symbol is a thing, not a picture of a thing.</p>
<p>Hrant:</p>
<blockquote>I'm not opposed to a full double serif up top. But: why? For one thing, the need to relieve crowding that John mentioned should possibly be extended to the top = no serifs. Also, numerals don't have head-serifs.</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find any problem with crowding or busyness at the top of the symbol, but then I also didn&rsquo;t place the bars as high as in the official logo sign. Why not? Because that&rsquo;s not the convention of most currency symbols, and I didn&rsquo;t want to make the Turkish lira sign unnecessarily distinct in this regard (although I consider the higher bars a valid alternative that should be considered relative to the shape and size of the upturn terminal, as in Craig&rsquo;s lachrymal example).</p>
<p>I favoured a double serif at the top because, with few exceptions, <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U20A0.pdf">currency symbols</a> are based on uppercase letters, and the other Cambria currency symbols follow this pattern. Once again, I think it makes sense to follow what one has already done in the other currency symbols in a typeface, in e.g. the yen symbol. Now, that said, it should be obvious that if one has deliberately crafted currency symbols that utilise terminals referencing lowercase forms, maybe for use with oldstyle numerals, then it would make sense to apply the same approach to the Turkish lira sign. In other words, the shape of serifs to be used is not part of a basic construction model, but a design-specific determinant of the general approach to currency symbol design.</p>
<hr>
<p>Most of the discussion so far has focused on the relationship of this symbol to the uppercase L, with some reference to the anchor notion. It may be helpful to consider that the sign also resembles a lowercase t, and this is presumably intentional. This is why I think Craig&rsquo;s &lsquo;elephant in the room&rsquo; is potentially a legitimate variant, although I think it would benefit from longer and slanted bars.</p>

By &ldquo;informalizing&rdquo; that intersection, it seems to me the curve of the glyph changes character from an arm/leg (as in /L/) to a tail (as in /Q/). I think there may be promise in that reconceptualization, since the curve has to do things we don&rsquo;t expect arms/legs to do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Craig, I think that construction is a valid option if that&rsquo;s the sort of thing that happens in the typeface design. Note that the closed loop reversal in £ is usually a factor arising from the slant of the descending stroke &ndash; the more vertical the stem, the more likely a simple stop-reversal or corner &ndash; and is specifically a cursive construction, i.e. in ductus terms a result of the pen not ceasing to move. So I can see this form of construction being particularly appropriate in italic fonts that follow cursive ductus models. And, of course, there is no reason why the roman and italic forms of the symbol should have the same construction, just as one might vary the treatment of terminals and stroke transitions between roman and italic £ $ etc.</div>

<p>Craig, do you think it&rsquo;s good to evoke the £?</p>
<p>Chris, I&rsquo;m repeating myself, but I think the Arabic-script undercurrent in Turkish culture is too easily ignored (especially by Westerners) and it&rsquo;s something that should instead take pride of place. And the fact that this symbol is to be used with a set of symbols that have their [recent] origins in Arabic only amplifies this.</p>

<p>We can try to ignore the one or the other aspect, it won’t help much. The official drawing presented by the Prime Minister has nothing – <strong>nothing</strong> – of neither <strong>L </strong>nor <strong>t</strong> nor ‘anchor’. It simply hasn’t. As you say: post facto interpretation. I reject to take it for serious that the proposed design has something of an capital L. It has as much resemblance of a capital L than it bears resemblance of a Turk praying (viewed sideways) with a upturned c***.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So I did some thinking, and some rough sketching, and came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three ways to do the top.</li>
<li>Four &ldquo;essential&rdquo; terminal styles.</li>
<li>Seven ways to handle the critical bottom-left.</li>
<li>Two ways to modulate the bottom.</li>
<li>And two ways to connect the bottom to the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>To narrow down the permutations, here are ideas I&rsquo;m getting comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The glyph should be a cross between caps and numerals.</li>
<li>The best place to make it look like a capital is the top.</li>
<li>The best place to make it belong with the numerals is the terminal.</li>
<li>The bottom-left must have a singularity, probably a serif (but not a [closed] loop).</li>
<li>The bottom &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; should be thin (assuming contrast), not least because I&rsquo;m a fan of &ldquo;rationalist&rdquo; stroke contrast in the numerals anyway.</li>
<li>Attaching an up-curving form immediately at the bottom of the stem is no good.</li>
<li>The structure should be able to accommodate narrowness.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to see two overall strategies to combine everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very conservative, where I&rsquo;m ending up with something like what John first showed, and Kent just showed. Although it&rsquo;s solid, it also feels like a lost opportunity.</li>
<li>Something akin to Craig&rsquo;s &ldquo;rocker bottom&rdquo; version, but less flamboyant (and with capital serifs up top). I think curving the bottom might be the key ingredient to making this click.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this all sounds too detached from the making of glyphs, sorry, this is how I roll. But now I <em>am</em> ready to make glyphs.</p>

Probably because I have a weakness for sharp implements&hellip; The extra Arabic flavor and the crescent allusion really kick it up a notch; I think the official structure should have been like this actually.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael, there&rsquo;s an interesting passage in a newly posted online article you might want to read:
<a href="http://designtraveler.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/turkey-part-i-the-young-typographic-founders-of-istype-istanbul/">http://designtraveler.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/turkey-part-i-the-young-typographic-founders-of-istype-istanbul/</a>
It&rsquo;s the paragraph following the photo captioned &ldquo;Turkish Delight / Antique tobacco packaging from an earlier Turkey&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Andreas: I hope you don&rsquo;t think your stance is discouraging people from resolving this fascinating design problem.* For one thing I don&rsquo;t know how half an anchor is less &ldquo;decadent&rdquo; than one-third of a crescent&hellip; It might seem strange to see an Armenian defending Turks, but I hope you eventually realize that you&rsquo;re being unnecessarily offensive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I myself will be working on it after my imminent trip to Istanbul.</li>
