  body: "x = NaN\r\n\r\nPlatform 3, encoding 1, language 1 is MS Windows, Unicode,
    English (from memory :-) and does not support encoding beyond the basic UC plane
    -- it maxes out just before U+FFFF. If these two characters are the only ones
    in this font, there is nothing to put into this encoding. Hence the error.\r\n\r\nI
    understand it's recommended to always have a regular space in your font; perhaps
    that's all to make yours valid. (At least it won't take up excessive space. (g))"

  body: "Perfect. Thanks so much Theunis.\r\n\r\nThe faces I've made in the past have
    been quite simple; plunking in characters from illustrator, and playing with metrics.
    I'm trying to dive into additional features in earnest, and this is the first
    time I've had to add a range to my uranges.dat and created an alt character within
    this newly created range... so I tried it straight away, just in case...\r\n\r\nI'm
    building two distinct typefaces of ~200 'display' emoticons, one is an outline,
    and the other is a filled form / tonal layer. Every character in each of the two
    faces is to have a stylistic alt. I'll be substituting Aa-Zz, 0-9 with similar
    nonsense, some are irrationally complex, so I promise the faces will be bloated
    by the time I'm finished.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can add to further optimize
    my Open Type code?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
