Their new site might be a hair slow, but the features for looking at font samples before you make your purchase are cool. You can type in your line of text and each font in the search will come up with that copy. Checkout is steamlined. And, service for font updates comes in handy. But, not all fonts are available at MyFonts. So, I wanted to get other folks views about other vendors. Which vendors do they prefer and, most importantly, why? </div>

Hopefully, clients have the patience to look beyond the big vendors and give the many small one-person shops a look. Getting a market presence is not quick and easy. Vendors like MyFonts are sort of an intermediary that takes a chunk of the pie yet returns a steady stream of type seekers. The tough part is getting your work to show up often enough on their home page or "hot" lists when you compete with thousands of others.

Don: Thanks for supporting your local type foundry. Upside: Support the artist, not the middleman. Downsides: Uncertain service after the sale and almost no foundry sites have the cool font preview feature.

dezoom: That points to one of the downsides to MyFonts, which is that they seem to have their favorites. These favorites seem to enjoy more front page billing. They are not necessarily my favorites.

		<div class="commentbody">The "popular" designers and font lists are generated by sales so it is kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy thing. The tough part is cracking in to the lists with lots of sales. Once you are in, it becomes easier because there are more people looking at your work.

Many of the things on MyFonts popular lists appeal to font buying groups like scrap-bookers. They love clipart looking stuff and frames and borders--also, cartoony and folksy hand written looking stuff.  To me, much of this sort of thing looks unappealing but I am not in that demographic. Remember that sales success does not equal quality design. It means finding a market niche and feeding it what it wants. As a designer, you have to decide if you are more interested in sales volume than fine quality work.  If you are a combination of very good and good at marketing, with a bit of luck, you might get both acclaim and wealth.

Do you know that for a fact? I was guessing it was random because I see my font appear about as frequently as anything else (ie: not often at all).

Turn it around ... is there any reason to purchase from a reseller? (I'm not denying it ... if you need to order media [does anyone ship things anymore], or there are volume discounts for large purchase volumes, then maybe a retailer makes sense).

But for the one off, buy from the little guy.</div>

We ship things, and provide discounts to large purchase volumes. Just normal stuff in the course of doing business, and since we never use resellers, something that our customers expect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Definately, I buy from the type maker if possible. Guys like Gerald Unger will actually consult with you and such. Fantastic! 

I always buy from locally owned restaurants and have not bought food at chains in years. Sure, occasionaly you must. However, why would I buy typefaces from chains? Support designers. I would think that designers would support designers. That seems obvious. There are so many fantastic type designers. Who wants to see more of the same? 

I have been eyeing "Dolly" by Underware for sometime. Love that type. Just have to find the right application. </div>
