body: This is my first typeface, previously displayed in the sans-category here. Back
  then I had no idea what a display typeface was nor that I was actually designing
  one. I have worked alot on Magma since then and have come to a result I&#39;m fairly
  happy about. All the Latin1 characters are made &#40;I hope..&#41; and lots and
  lots of kerning have been done, not like you guys would be unfamiliar with that,
  hehe <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;d like to present Magma, revision 2, a display font
  completley made from scratch. I&#39;d love some comments and critique. <BR> <BR><img
  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47421.gif" alt="Magma2"> <BR> <BR>The
  reason for Magma being display and simply not a sans is that it just looks way better
  in largescale. If i&#39;m wrong on this point and Magma still is not a display face,
  please point me in the right direction as I&#39;m still relativley new to typography.
  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t checked if Magma is some trademark violation yet, so there
  is a possibility that the typeface will change name.  <BR> <BR>I hope no one minds
  that I post a new thread, this just feel so different from the original subject.
  If a moderator should prefer so, please merge this thread with the old one or delete
  on of them.  <BR> <BR>Best regards, <BR>Andreas Climent <BR><a href="http://www.karmacube.com"

  body: Its simple and sweet, I like this Display-Face. <BR> <BR> Maybe you can try
    to find a softener solution on &#34;w&#34;, i think it seems harder than the other
    characters. maybe just &#34;cut off&#34; the cross, the above part in the middle.
    <BR> <BR>A couple of years ago I developed a display-typeface called Heaventica,
    but after a Hard-disc accident i haven&#39;t been able to finished it. <BR>You
    can check that out anyway in the typophile-forum. <BR> <BR>
