		<div class="commentbody">Paul, I agree that sans text tends to slow you down, and is never suitable for long text. Still, short text can work quite well sometimes. <BR> <BR>But the more readable sans are generally humanist, based on the oval rather than the circle. I think there is a problem with spacing in the more geometrical ones - the space between letters is too small compared to the counters. So, for example, Meta is much more readable than Helvetica in text. I think Unger's Vesta is one of the more readable ones.  <BR> <BR>I'm not sure whether the the theory of Bloesma is really born out by FF Legato, but It is interesting. I'd like to look at it. Thanks for flagging it, Hrant.  <BR> <BR>Ok, this is one of my pet peeves, but I think Helvetica in printed text is not a mistake but a crime <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

They can have a bad &quot;g&quot;, they can be poorly spaced, they can have lousy vertical proportions, ad infinitum. It's not just a matter of fashion. <BR> <BR>As for the print/online duality: <BR>1) Most Helvetica lovers hate Arial. I myself think the latter is less bad. <BR>2) There's a limit to how &quot;real&quot; WYSIWYG is anyway. The only way to make Helvetica/Arial look remotely (and never totally) like Helvetica/Arial onscreen is to use full anti-aliasing, and that makes small text excruciatingly blurry. And if you go for 1-bit rendering of Arial (Helvetica's sucks) then it's really not at all the same font in practice anyway. In that case I might use Arial for the screen and Unica for print. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>If you're here for typographic advice, please keep an open mind - we debunk a lot of crap around here. <BR>If you just want to hear other graphic designer chant &quot;Helvetica is cool&quot;, try AIGA or something.  :-) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

It is the first typeface to truly encompass the &quot;idea&quot; of family. Look at Fruiger's original display from the late 50s where he shows the joined family of weights and widths in a perfect progression with a logical numbering system to boot.   <BR>Frutiger's &quot;idea&quot; was to create a typeface with the possibility of UNIVERSal use. <BR>Helvetica came out at about the same time but IMHO failed miserably at making a better, more homogenous AG. <BR>Don't confuse popularity with ideology.  If Univers or Franklin Gothic had been bundled with every computer on the planet instead of Helvetica, there would have been no &quot;Helvidea&quot; <BR> <BR>You might also read Bodoni's book. If there is a typeface which might be spawned from an idea, Bodoni is more it than any.  Another is Futura or any of the constructivist fonts. <BR> <BR>The truth is, Hrant is right, they are all just typefaces. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">AG, started it perhaps unknowingly.  Univers and Helvetica were big parts of the typography of the Swiss/German philosophy of the &quot;neautral&quot; typeface which lends only its clarity to the communication.  The typgraphers USE of the face was the area that brought the NON-detached or purposive/active message building.  If you look at the works of Emil Ruder and his many students, you will see the same neutral face used again and again but the way it is used is as active to the message and playful as could have been for the time. In the USA, where a far greater variety of faces were used, the construction of the typography was much simpler&ndash;even boring.  The Face was asked to do much more so it could not be neutral. <BR>One difference is that the neutral faces have to be strong enough to take a beating (see Weingart or April Greiman's work). The not-nuetral faces rely on their own forms for expression and cannot handle the abuse of partial oblitteration and superimposition.  Later, the Emigre people put the oblitteration right into the typeface making it less versatile and requiring many more font purchases.  You must remember that the time and cost of creating a new typeface in the 50s was orders of magnitude greater than it has become in recent years. In prior times type setters had only a few faces.  Choice was minimal. Neutral/versatile faces made great sense.  Today, choice is overwhelming.  What you can't find ready-made, you can have designed by any of the Typophiles here (or other places too). <BR> <BR>It remains to be seen what we do with all this choice.  We live in an era of a typeface CostCo or Walmarts.  (You can get anything you want at the Typophile resturant&ndash;excepting Berthold:-) ). <BR>Hopefully the typographers who use our type will be as innovative as the generation before us. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>
