    believe that more than a fraction of Windows users have enough knowledge to know

    fonts are old type one PostScript from back in the day when the bigger font vendors
    doctored names so that their corporate name did not affect the order--Adobe Garamond
    fell under \"G\" instead of \"A\". How \"ITC\" sneaks in in the \"B\" area makes
    no sense even with that.  My guess is that the old way meets the new way and got
    fritzed in the process--that or it is a clue from the Knights of the Templar :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"
