body: "Hey Everyone, \r\n\r\nThese are probably 'newbie' questions but I did some
  searching and I can't find the answers to either of these. \u263A\r\n\r\n1. <em>What
  does OSF at the end of the typeface mean, and in what situation would it properly
  be used for?</em>\r\n\r\n2. <em>When using a Display variation of a typeface, whats
  the smallest you should use it at, or is there no set size limit...</em>\r\n\r\nIf
  it helps at all, or if you're curious, I'm currently working with Farnham.\r\n\r\nAny
  extra information on the subject of this typeface (opinions on it, etc...) and different
  variations would be <strong>greatly</strong> appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

    LF are lining figures which are all the same height - (usually) the height of
    the caps. Sometimes a little smaller. '

  body: "Rosem -\r\n\r\nWelcome to type.\r\n\r\nIn the days of yore - we had text
    and then display/headline type.\r\nText was just that - type up to approx. 12
    points in height.\r\n\r\nDisplay on a typesetter would start at 14 pts.\r\n\r\nWhile
    headline was synonomous with typositor - or letters at 1/2 to 2 inches high. (Blown
    up further by a stat camera.)\r\n\r\nThe true difference between a text and a
    display font was the personalities of the letters. Text when hung up 12 or more
    inches away from you - and upside down - should appear as a gray matter, no one
    letter popping off the page.\r\n\r\nWhile a display type turned upside down, let's
    you say - oh I see those letters...."

  body: Some OSF aren't considered particularly kosher for use by USPS, however.  They
    generally prefer lining figures because the glyphs are easier to scan.
