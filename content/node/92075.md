body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface with the stroke contrast typical
  to Didot, but with the letterforms typical to Garamond -- particularly the overhanging
  lowercase f. Every transitional/modern serif I can find has this scrawny, squashed
  f. It makes me cry."

  body: Sounds like you want an Old Style with optical weights for "big, display".
    Perhaps you like Requiem Fine for example. http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_features.php?featureID=42&productLineID=100020

  body: "That roman looks a good deal like Garamond Premiere Pro, which I already
    have. (The italic is neat, though.) I'm looking for something with even greater
    stroke contrast... something close to Didot in stroke design, really.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and preferably (let's make this even more difficult!), I need something that works
    at text sizes. Billtroop's comment [[http://typophile.com/node/10167|here]] (about
    a third of the way down) names the few Didot recreations that are based on text
    designs, not display designs. All of them have that <em>stupid lowercase f</em>."

  body: "Thanks for the insight, people. Tiemann and Big Caslon are probably best.
    And\u2014don't kill me\u2014I actually got something close to what I was going
    for by using Garamond's Display weight at a smallish size (20 pt.) and increasing
    the spacing by a hair."
