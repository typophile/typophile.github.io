		<div class="commentbody">Drat, I don't have my copy of Bringhurst with me here at work (why do I leave home without it?), so I'll go from pure recall.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To paraphrase big time, Bringhurst says that as the transition from metal and photo to digital type got underway, most manufacturers of digital type simply retained the names of fonts that existed in previous forms. But Bitstream avoided the fiction that these new digital types were the equivalents of their predecessors, and so they provided new, and perhaps more systematic, names for them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interestingly, then, the spin Bringhurst puts on this is that Bitstream renamed their fonts for reasons of scholarship and integrity, rather than out of any other motivation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Corrections/clarifications most welcome! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bitstream renamed their fonts for reasons of scholarship and integrity <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rubbish! The Bitstream founders (Matthew Carter, Cherie Cone, MIke Parker) were ex-Linotype. And while rumours were never substantiated that maybe some data had found its way onto some hard drives in Cambridge, they had to rename their versions of Helvetica, Univers, Times et al because Linotype (and Monotype, Berthold etc) wouldn't license the names to the new competitor. As it happens, some of the Bitstream versions of those classics were better than the original foundries' who turned out some pretty horrific stuff during the first digital phase. I'm talking late 70s here, pre PostScript and LaserWriters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">erik spiekermann said <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Rubbish! &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quite so. There was no 'scholarship and integrity' involved, so far as I could ever tell. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know about data use, per se, but otherwise, how does a library of several hundred fonts appear seemingly overnight? Or, within several months, with 1980-82 technology. (Remember how slow, even at the minicomputer and mainframe level? Because the chip makers apparently just couldn't make enough Fritos fast enough to get the boards cheaper and faster?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And actually, as one goes back in time and really studies a lot of typefaces from the early 1900s through phototypesetting, with some exception, the actual form of a lot of what was available was truly horrific. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Early phototypesetting and early digital fonts were even supplied with no kerning. And were at least $185. each. Per weight. If a mediocre kerning data add-on was available at all, one paid extra.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's a long-extant bitter irony that it took a sudden collection of unlicensed digital clones to start to get the industry to get its act together, so far as digitized font quality. (Of course, it could have been coincidence.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But is that galvanizing effect a reason to buy and use unlicensed clones? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've always believed it subverted the entire industry. And institutionalized cloning, making it seem, to the new generation of giddy desktop designers and those who sold to them, that it was ok to both clone fonts, sell them, and use them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Granted, they weren't the first. But the industry, mostly through the work of aTypI, really was trying to clean up its act in the late '70s. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sale of unlicensed fonts to an unwitting public, combined with bundling and discounting, slowed down development and release of otherwise worthy new, licensed typefaces, I believe, at a rate that would have served the electronic publishing community from the mid-'80s and throughout the '90s, much more effectively. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Yes, it has always been entirely possible to be a well-read progessional in the graphic arts, and still unwitting about knockoffs. Even today. Which is why it's possible for clone companies to make inroads, brandishing cost savings.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rhetorically: When one talks about faceless, giant, megalithic, uncaring type foundries that only look at profiteering at any cost, which one do you think really fits that description best? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While practically every other commercial foundry, large or small, has subsequently had to endure that characterization at one time or another in the digital world (mostly by people who had no idea what they were babbling about), the characterization is misplaced and unfair, I think. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The crowned prince needs to accept the crown. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">By the way, to directly answer Alexey Lysenkov's original question: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Can anybody please clarify me the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;thing with font renaming - as in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Humanist 521 and Gill Sans, Swiss 721 and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Helvetica, etc.?

Is it only Bitstream's &quot;disease&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;or was it popular for some period of time?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I just don't get it&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't worry, it's no industry standard.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So far as I can tell from following it over the years, it has never been a universally popular naming convention. Or universally accepted as anything other than a marketing approach reaching toward a cache of seeming exclusivity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it has been very confusing, historically, since it first appeared to the graphic arts public about 1982 or so. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because that kind of marketing approach leads to the need (many industry experts have historically believed) for cross-reference tables (&quot;Industry names versus 'our name'&quot;), it can become terribly time consuming and frustrating for the average graphic designer, production manager, and prepress house to both make a type choice and be sure that you have, indeed, made the correct choice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And so it also becomes a way of getting one to have to rely on outside consultants (even an otherwise unnecessary phone call to the vendor) for even basic FAQ kinds of questions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whether the generic is the same or as good as or better than the brand name is a vexing enough question for frozen peas. It's even more confusing for typefaces. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And the availiability, then, of cross-reference tables serves to literally take bread out of the mouths of licensing designers, and those managers and employees at foundries who try to go the licensed route because they believe it is the moral high ground. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall, the naming scheme was Bitstream's marrying up of standard classification names to what are essentially randomly selected job lot numbers, to create what appeared to be authentic and believable names. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other foundries, such as Monotype, have used numbers in many of their type family names previously. To signify specific, and often, original works. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I believe that Bitstream's use of numbering after standard classification names, was the first time that was done in that particular way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helpful as an approach? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(If anyone knows of an earlier such model, I'd love to know about it.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">A few more observations re Bitstream: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they certainly didn't have licenses from Linotype, thus the new naming system. It may make sense, but it was mainly a way of getting over the licensing issue. In the early 90s, Linotype's lawyer made us remove the Bitstream cross-referencing to the &quot;industry names&quot; as they called it, as that was seen as an infringement on Linotype's rights to these names. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand it has to pointed out that back in those days, fonts were tied to typesetting equipment. You couldn't get the original Helvetica unless you had a Linotype machine. There was some cross-licensing with Berthold, who got Optima, Palatino; Univers, Frutiger, Helvetica and some others in exchange for Akzidenz Grotesk, Concorde et al. BItstream were the first people to sell device-independent digital fonts, as ITC had been the first people to sell artwork to any manufacturer who paid for it and then had to make their own fonts from ITC's drawings. That's why ITC fonts looked very different, depending who had made the font, analog or early (ie pre-PostScript) digital. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, Wendy Richmond was and is a very nice (and knowledgable) person: She was with Camex at the time, one of Bitstream's first (if not the first) licensees.</div>
