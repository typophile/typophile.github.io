  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>After considering several opinions on my newspaper aimed typeface [[http://typophile.com/node/54211|Novena text]] I released a [[http://typophile.com/node/54211|new beta version]], completely renewed in its details.
In the meanwhile, I won the attention of some locale publisher who looked at sketches and a couple of hardcopies I left under a table, so the encouraged me to work in order to apply Novena in their publications.
<img src="/images/old-images/Novena_Typophile_5841.jpg" alt="">
There is an attachment for printing: a light-weight 4 pages PDF that better demonstrates how it actually prints, that&rsquo;s its main target.
So, next steps are finishing my regular text version and accelerating the work on the rest of the family.
I hope not to disappoint expectations and, for that reason, I need a lot of critique from Typophiles.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m sorry there&rsquo;s so little critique on this one. I&rsquo;ve seen it posted several times now and it&rsquo;s definitly good enough to get some attention. It&rsquo;s a lovely typeface, but there&rsquo;s really nothing about it that strikes me.</p>
<p>The terminal on lc &ldquo;a&rdquo; could be more exciting. The same goes for the ear on lc &ldquo;g&rdquo;. The ear also forms a dark spot which you might want to correct optically. The leftmost stroke in uc &ldquo;Æ&rdquo; should lean that much, in my opinion. The letter is a bit wide. I love the lc &ldquo;t&rdquo;. Lc &ldquo;x&rdquo; has some problems with the serifs on the thick diagonal.</p>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m bothered by the lack of human details despite the leaning stress. It feels very mechanical.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I feel a bit like Frode about this. It looks so polished that it&rsquo;s hard to see where there might be some room for work – especially for a beginner like myself. 
It&rsquo;s quite impressive! Though I do agree about the &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; look; it feels very &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, and could maybe be more distinctive. I must say I&rsquo;m impressed with this, but it doesn&rsquo;t excite me on a deeper level, or feel like something I&rsquo;ve never seen before. Though I guess that&rsquo;s not the worst thing that can be said about a newspaper face.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve been wondering about is some of the proportions (and bear in mind this is coming from someone working on her first font – so take with a big grain of salt).
Specifically, the &ldquo;n&rdquo; (&amp; thus, the &ldquo;h&rdquo;) looks a hair narrow to me when compared to say the &ldquo;o&rdquo; and &ldquo;bdpq&rdquo;. Actually, the &ldquo;n&rdquo; even seems narrow compared to the &ldquo;m&rdquo; and the &ldquo;u&rdquo;, the &ldquo;m&rdquo; looking like it&rsquo;s about 2 units short of being a perfect duplication of the &ldquo;n&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;u&rdquo; almost exactly equal in width to the &ldquo;n&rdquo;. Is that intentional?</p>
<p>Speaking of the &ldquo;u&rdquo;, its bottom left might be a tad heavy/lumpy (the same is true for the analogous curve in the &ldquo;n&rdquo;). And the (unparalleled?) upwards motion of the &ldquo;u&rdquo; serifs feels odd – but I think I have a personal problem understanding &ldquo;u&rdquo; serifs. ;-)</p>
<p>And I dare hardly say this, but the &ldquo;9&rdquo; still feels a bit unbalanced, though I can&rsquo;t really say why.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I don&rsquo;t think I can offer much helpful input. I wonder where the experts are?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow! I&rsquo;m really shocked by your latest comments, at the point I feel myself strange and confused —I cannot blame anybody for that.</p>
<p>After reading, I put hands on work trying to correct what I did bad and&hellip; oops! I forgot to backup the original version so I made a disaster. Fortunately I recovered it from the OT font, though I missed a lot of stuff like masks, guidelines and so.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it did not discourage me: curiously I love to hear critiques and start over again and again —even when I lose an entire font file ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Nina:</strong> <em>Actually, the “n” even seems narrow compared to the “m” and the “u”, the “m” looking like it’s about 2 units short of being a perfect duplication of the “n”, and the “u” almost exactly equal in width to the “n”. Is that intentional?</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Look at these four pictures, where I compare proportions of the pair “m-n” on Novena (before I broke it) and Georgia (quite different, I guess) by placing the “n” within the mask:
<img src="/images/old-images/m1_5374.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/m2_6489.jpg" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost the same happens by turning the “n” upside down and comparing against the “u” (the “n” is within the mask space again):
<img src="/images/old-images/u1_5343.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/u2_6678.jpg" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved your newborn Ernestina at a first glance (I&rsquo;ll make my comments later).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Huh! I think that <strong>there</strong> is the reason by which you friends find the face so “mechanical”: in my obsessive search of matching the propper measurements and proportions, I missed the fact that type design —design as a whole— is the triumph of sensitivity over given rules to create its own rules.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s late now to deal with philosophy, and I must face a hard work on that wretched font.
Thank you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Marcelo,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I came across too harsh. I honestly think this is an impressive, and already very polished, font, which could maybe just use a little treatment with the diamond file here and there :-). And since you seemed quite desperate to get more feed-back on it, I figured I&rsquo;d note some things that struck me – but like I said: 
You really shouldn&rsquo;t follow <em>my</em> opinion to the letter! (Ignore the bad pun.)</p>
<p><em>forgot to backup the original version so I made a disaster</em>
:-{
Get a backup strategy. I&rsquo;ve been there, &amp; since then I&rsquo;ve become quite religious about doing daily backups of all the stuff I&rsquo;m working on. (Also, keeping multiple [dated] versions is a good idea.)</p>
<p>Re the &ldquo;m&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo;, I guess we&rsquo;re looking at different fonts for guidance/input ;-). Here&rsquo;s Swift and Constantia:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/swift-mn_5270.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/old-images/constantia_mn_4170.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry so much. :-)</p>
