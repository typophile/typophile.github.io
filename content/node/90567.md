  a large vinyl letter of each above their cribs.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nBut I don't want
  to do anything too generic. So I am hoping you guys can come up with some awesome
  A and Es. What are your favorites? I'm thinking upper case would make sense, but
  if a lower case works, all the better. It could be ornate or incredibly simple but
  beautiful."

  body: Congratulations! Was not quite clear from your post, but were you thinking
    of designing the letters yourself, and were just asking for inspirational sources?
    Because designing them yourself would make them more memorable, years from now.
