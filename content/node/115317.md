  body: Looks like some "classic" compressed grotesk/gothic to me but wasn't able
    to find an exact match. I'm struggling on /t which is similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic/m-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/507138/85|Dharma
    Gothic's]]. For the moment, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/reforma-grotesk-bold-e|Reforma
    Grotesk]] is the closest one I could suggest. Need to dig more.

  body: You're definitely right, Akira! I always forgot Knockout has such a "bottom-curved"
    /t. Thanks for solving it!
