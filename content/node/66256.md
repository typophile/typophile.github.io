body: "I'm writing an English article about an old Japanese letter cutter to make
  originals for letterpress matrices.\r\nHe made them with chisels only. No counter
  punch is used.\r\nSince the originals he made are used for Electrotype Matrices,
  no Punch action, so I was wondering if I should call him \"Punch cutter.\"\r\nI'm
  looking for a proper word or a terminology in English to express him.\r\nDoes anyone
  know the terminology to express a craftsman like him.\r\nOr may I call him a punch
  cutter?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nKunihiko Okano\r\nShotype.com"

    of Koch on Walter Tracy's Letters of Credit. This is the only stuff I have to
    know about Koch's Neuland.\r\nIf an engraver cut the letter without any drawing,
    the engraver should be called a type designer or letter artist? I might have misunderstood
    but I felt that.\r\nA Japanese letter cutter I mentioned above also cut the letter
    directly without any drawing."

  body: "> What process of matrix-making do you have in mind?\r\nI wanted to know
    an alternative word (or the term) of \"Punches\" the engraver made. I thought
    I should not use the words \"Punch\" and \"Punchcutter\", because the letter carved
    by Japanese engraver is used for Electrotype Matrices. I came up with the word
    \"master\" or \"original\", but I didn't know the proper word.\r\n\r\n>In the

    mentioned the difference between a punchcutter and engraver. I should have searched
    all of the stuff I have.\r\nI'll also check them.\r\nI'd appreciated if I could

    call the resulting piece a matrix until it had been fitted for the hand mould
    or casting machine.  Before that it'd be called a strike.\r\n\r\nA matrix engraver
    cuts a character image into a planchet on a pantograph using a relief engraving
    pattern, then finishes it for alignment and set width."

  body: "Looking at those images brought me back to ATypI conference in Leipzig, where
    Dan Carr made some glyphs to demonstrate the craft of punchcutting. It was just
    beautiful, and gave a better perspective, when I went to visit Ensched\xE9 Type
    Museum a week after. \r\n\r\nI had a chance to hold in my hands the original punches
    of Didot Non Plus Ultra, and also the matrices made with them, and the final product:
    a catechismus printed in that font. The book was the size of a matchbox. I think
    that the type was between 2 and 3 points. Matrices were not individual, but instead
    they were made in single lines of text. Most impressive was the fact that I could
    easily recognize Didot even in that size and the rough paper.\r\n\r\nIt was made
    by Henry Didot somewhere after 1860, and was one his last works. It's too bad,
    that I could not bring my camera in the museum, because Ensched\xE9 is still printing
    money, so they are pretty pernickety about the rules\u2026"
