  level which I noticed here around, then I would like to present my new and the first
  font which I developed using FontForge, and herewith I will attach some examples
  which I hope it will be enough to give you general idea about the font, so I will
  be so great full when I get your opinion, comments maybe also advises.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: Mabrook! - knowing how hard it is to develop Arabic fonts I am most impressed-
    it is beautiful. It would be great to hear some technical details about your experience
    using FontForge. What encoding did you use? Did you generate the font directly
    from it? Did you use VOLT? How did you achieve the sloping vertical alignment?
    Some of the marks clash with dots or letters - will you be able to fix that?  Again
    congratulations very well done and for a first font.

    what I frequently say to release you and  those awaiting your font:\r\nIt is Impossible
    to create an error-free, uncompromising and standalone Arabic font.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/120811\r\n\r\n"
