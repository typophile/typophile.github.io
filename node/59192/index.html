	State legislators faced with mammoth budget gaps and sharply lower revenue 
	are looking to residents to bail them out.</p>
	<p>Right now, at least 47 states are facing significant shortfalls in their 
	2009 and/or 2010 budgets, according to the Center on Budget and Policy 
	Priorities, a think tank in Washington, D.C. And many of those states are 
	looking to tax hikes to help fill the gaps.</p>
	<p>“Pretty much everyone is doing poorly,” says Kim Rueben, senior research 
	associate at the Tax Policy Center. “It’s just a question of who’s hurting 
	more than others.”</p>
	<p>The top honor goes to California, which is projecting that it will fall 
	about $25 billion short come fiscal 2010. Taking second place is New York 
	with a projected $17.6 billion deficit for fiscal 2010, according to the 
	National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan policy research 
	organization in Washington, D.C.</p>
	<p>How can these states miss the mark so badly? The recession has sapped the 
	two major sources of state revenue: income taxes (thanks to rising 
	unemployment, fewer people are getting paid) and sales taxes (quite simply, 
	consumers are spending less.) “Those two things together really, really lead 
	to a high loss of tax revenues, far in excess of loss of income,” says 
	Michael Hicks, director of Ball State University’s Center for Business and 
	Economic Research.</p>
	<p>Even though raising taxes are typically a last resort, many states have 
	no choice but to do so. And, in some, lawmakers are leaving no stone 
	unturned when it comes to finding items or services to tax. New York, for 
	instance, has raised taxes on tobacco, wine and limo services. Meanwhile, 
	Massachusetts is proposing a tax on satellite television service and Georgia 
	lawmakers are proposing a “pole tax” that would charge gentlemen’s club 
	patrons $5 at the door.</p>
	<p>To figure out which states are inflicting the biggest tax hikes on 
	residents, SmartMoney pored over reports from tax research groups and 
	contacted state budget offices. We looked at state budget deficits tracked 
	by the National Conference of State Legislatures and current sales tax rate 
	data from the Federation of Tax Administrators, a group that provides 
	services to state tax authorities. Finally, we turned to the Tax Foundation 
	— a nonpartisan tax research group — for figures on tax burden, the average 
	percentage of each state’s residents’ income that is paid in state and local 
	taxes (the figures we use are for 2008).</p>
	<p>Here are six states where residents should prepare to pay up.</p>

	<h6>California: Diminishing This Huge Deficit May Just Be a Dream</h6>
	<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $24.7 billion<br>
	Percent of general fund budget: 22.3%<br>
	State and local tax burden: 10.5%; Rank: 6</p>
	<p>California is facing the biggest budget deficit in the nation, yet 
	voters’ willingness to chip in is starting to wane. Last month, they voted 
	down five ballot measures that included sales and income tax increases. Who 
	could blame them? At 11%, California has one of the worst unemployment rates 
	in the country, the housing market has been decimated, and the state already 
	raised taxes on sales by 1% to 8.25% and income by 0.25% (both of which 
	expire in 2011). Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s latest budget plan includes 
	steep spending cuts across the government and cutbacks in social services.</p>
	<p>In a testament to California’s grim predicament, one assemblyman’s 
	proposal to legalize marijuana for personal use and allow counties to tax it 
	is gaining public support. It’s one of the “wacky things you might be able 
	to get away with now,” says Rueben.</p>
	<h6>New York: If It’s Bad for You, It Will Be Taxed</h6>
	<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $17.6 billion<br>
	Percent of general fund budget: 31.9%<br>
	State and local tax burden: 11.7%; Rank: 2</p>
	<p>New York State Gov. David Paterson may have been unsuccessful in levying 
	an 18% tax on soda and other sugary drinks in the name of combating obesity, 
	but he’s had a hand in raising taxes on plenty of other “sinful” items, 
	including tobacco (up to 46% from 37%) and wine (up 58% per gallon, or about 
	two cents more per bottle).</p>
	<p>For those living in New York, all those tax hikes can really add up. 
	Second only to New Jersey, New Yorkers bear the second-highest tax burden 
	thanks to a high income-tax rate of 7.85% (for those earning more than 
	$200,000). And property and gas taxes are among the highest in the nation, 
	according to the Tax Foundation. Nevertheless, shoppers can rejoice: The 
	sales tax here remains relatively low at just 4%.</p>
	<h6>Florida: Driving and Smoking Will Cost You</h6>
	<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $6 billion<br>
	Percent of general fund budget: 27%<br>
	State and local tax burden: 7.4%; Rank: 47</p>
	<p>Florida passed its budget in May with a not-so-pleasant surprise for 
	smokers: a $1-per-pack hike (the first such increase in 19 years). Motorists 
	also got hit with higher fees to renew a license or register a vehicle. It 
	could have been worse, though. Senate lawmakers had proposed eliminating the 
	sales tax exemption on items like bottled water and tickets to sporting 
	events, both of which didn’t make the cut.</p>
	<p>Still, residents here aren’t feeling as much tax pain as some of their 
	peers in other states. Overall, Florida’s tax burden is the third-lowest in 
	the nation and it’s one of eight states that imposes no individual income 
	tax, according to the Tax Foundation. But those perks may be outweighed by 
	the rest of Florida’s economic situation. Home values are among the nation’s 
	hardest hit and the state’s $6 billion budget deficit could mean more tax 
	hikes are on the horizon.</p>
	<h6>Massachusetts: Shoppers and Couch Potatoes, Prepare to Pay Up</h6>
	<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $3 billion<br>
	Percent of general fund budget: 11.2%<br>
	State and local tax burden: 9.5%; Rank: 23</p>
	<p>Just when Massachusetts was starting to shake its “Taxachusetts” nickname 
	(it’s ranked a middle-of-the-road 23rd in the Tax Foundation’s tax burden 
	assessment), the state is preparing to hike taxes on everything from alcohol 
	to satellite TV.</p>
	<p>The most hard-hitting for residents is a proposed increase in the sales 
	tax to 6.25% from 5%. Both the House and Senate approved the measure and 
	it’s looking likely the increase will pass by the July 1 deadline, says Noah 
	Berger, executive director of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an 
	independent research group. Satellite TV subscribers may also get hit. The 
	state is proposing a 5% sales tax on satellite services. Providers, of 
	course, are fighting the tax.</p>
	<h6>Arizona: Proposed Sales-Tax Hike Could Hurt Already-Strapped Residents</h6>
	<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $3 billion<br>
	Percent of general fund budget: 28.2%<br>
	State and local tax burden: 8.5%; Rank: 41</p>
	<p>The recession has thumped Arizona harder than most other states, says Lee 
	McPheters, research professor of economics at Arizona State University’s W.P. 
	Carey business school. The housing slump is partially to blame: During the 
	boom, construction accounted for at least a quarter of new jobs created. 
	Since home prices have fallen 43% from their peak, the construction industry 
	has lost tens of thousands of jobs, says McPheters. Arizona’s unemployment 
	rate in April was 7.7%, shy of the 8.9% national average.</p>
	<p>If Gov. Janice Brewer gets her way, residents will pay for the state’s 
	problems by shelling out an extra 1% at the cash register. The proposed 
	sales-tax hike, which would bring the rate to 6.6%, was omitted from the 
	budget the legislature passed this month, but the governor may veto the 
	budget until it’s put back in. (She could also place it on a November 
	special election ballot.)</p>
	<h6>Nevada: What Happens in Vegas Is Going to Cost You More</h6>
	<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $1.2 billion<br>
	Percent of general fund budget: 32%<br>
	State and local tax burden: 6.6%; Rank: 49</p>
	<p>Nevada’s freewheeling, low-tax past is coming back to haunt it like a bad 
	hangover. The state levies no personal income tax and imposes some of the 
	lowest taxes on businesses in the nation, says Bert Waisanen, a fiscal 
	analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
	<p>Nevada used to be able to afford being so generous with its residents. 
	Revenue from tourism and gambling supported the state just fine. But now, as 
	consumers would rather put their coins in a bank account than a slot 
	machine, that revenue source is drying up. In fact, the state boasts the 
	dubious honor of having the largest deficit in the country as a percentage 
	of its budget – 32%. It’s hiked the sales tax by 0.35% to 6.85% and taxes on 
	hotel rooms are up 3%. It’s even gambling with its business-friendly climate 
	by raising taxes on businesses.</div>
