  of Wonder&#34;. Anyway, throughout the exhibit <BR>as well as the support materials
  they&#39;re using a couple of <BR>nice typefaces, a sans and a serif, which look
  related. <BR> <BR>The sans especially looks very familiar, but I just can&#39;t
  <BR>put my finger on it &#40;all I know is, it looks very Unger&#41;. <BR>As for
  the serif, it looks like a variant of a recently <BR>released font, but there&#39;s
  some notable differences. <BR> <BR>So here&#39;s a scan: <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/getty.gif"

  really like to find out what these <BR>two fonts are, and who designed them. <BR>
  <BR>Note: Please do not email me any fonts! <BR>I&#39;d just like to know what the
  fonts are. <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>hhp'
