  body: "The Keely B can be a great thing for a designer to have, particulary if one
    wishes to tinker around with wood and other display type.\r\n\r\nQuite a bit more
    cumbersome and much heavier than a Vandercook, but the Kelly can be used a little
    like one. I had mine for more than 20 years and sometimes used it to pull proofs
    of large lino cuts. The large 17x22 size is really nice. \r\n\r\nAt one time I
    had condsidered removing the  feeder at the back of the press to make stream hand-feeding
    easier. \r\n\r\nAlso the 10x15 C&P is a nice gift.\r\n\r\nAnd the man offers free
    loading. what more could a person ask?\r\n\r\nJim"

  body: "This equipment is worth consideration. Not recommended for commercial printing
    but certainly for fine book production. It would require space. Knowledge how
    to use the equipment would take time. There are still people around that could
    consult by e-mail or telephone. Jim Rimmer or myself would probalby be helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    am not as \"Kelly Friendly\" as Jim but the sheet size is respectable. Bigger
