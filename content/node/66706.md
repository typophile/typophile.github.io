body: "I am about to assign a bunch (approx. 500) of Private Use UNICODE to the following
  which do not have official UNICODES and are not yet [to my knowledge] covered by
  Adobe Glyph List:\r\n\r\nNut fractions\r\nAnnotation Superiors \r\nSuperior Punctuation\r\nSmall
  Cap Numbers\r\nSmall Caps Punctuation\r\nTabulated Numbers\r\nTitling Capitals (x140ish)\r\nTitling
  Lowercase (x140ish)\r\nTitling Numbers\r\nReversed Encapsulated Sansserif Capitals\r\nand
  perhaps a few other ornaments (not dingbats) etc.\r\n\r\nQ. Are there any established
  Code-blocks for the listed glyphs above *agreed* between foundries? \r\n\r\nI am
  posting here before approaching anyone individually. My next step is to check the
  future of the Adobe Glyph List but first I want to gauge  the reaction to having
  so many apparently missing UNICODES.\r\n\r\nIf it seems reasonable, perhaps I may
  make a formal proposal to UNICODE Consortium. It feels better for me to push for
  some kind of universal acceptance of principle and/or get a better understanding
  of peoples feeling towards this before I go ahead and assign my one Private Use
  UNICODES to my own fonts regardless.\r\n\r\nI am conscious that if the above Glyphs
  can have UNICODES shared amongst the Community this will make fonts sharing the
  UNICODE compatible and easily interchangeable.\r\n\r\n/michael"

  body: "Most of what you've listed are stylistic variants, and are not assigned official
    Unicode points. Adobe has used Unicode PUA ranges in the past for some stylistic
    variants, but has reportedly deprecated this practice.\r\n\r\nThere are some documented
    agreements on character assignments in the Private Use Area, notably [[http://mufi.info/|Medieval
    Unicode Font Initiative]] and [[http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/|ConScript
    Unicode Registry]]. There may be others but I am not familiar with them. You may
    find some of the glyphs you want to encode have points within those ranges, and
    you can avoid thos ranges if there isn't a clear fit. The PUA is a big space.\r\n"

  body: "In the Adobe Fonts the unicode value assigned to small caps or swash capitals
    for example is not the same in all the fonts.\r\nIt seems like such glyphs are
    left for Open Type features to handle, but then what's the point in assigning
    unicodes? Is it good practice that every glyph has a unicode value?\r\n\r\nI'm
    sorry if my questions are slightly off subject but I didn't want to start a new
    thread with a very similar subject."

    does not have a Unicode number. This is bad practice on the software publisher's
    part. Does anyone remember with which programs this is the case, or with those

    to be sufficient to handle such stylistic variants. "

    A program that did not support Unicode these days would be the equivalent of a
    program not \"supporting\" ASCII in days past. I suppose you could think of the
    PUA of Unicode being equivalent to high-order ASCII.\r\n\r\nThe point of a Private
    Use Area is that it has no defined use. Asking for an agreement of typographic
    niceties shows a certain insensitivity to the purpose of Unicode. Consider documents
    that pass from one use to another, one font to another. That is job of Unicode.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a little point, but I abhor fonts with titling caps built into the font. I
    deal with large amounts of running text (books). Titling glyphs are almost always
    used for display, and with most work, display usually involves a separate font.
    If titling glyphs are built into a font, and an application program such as InDesign
    can't handle the switch to them easily, through a paragraph style, they are not
    as useful as they would be in a separate font.\r\n\r\nAs is so often the case,
    people who use type often have different ideas than people who design type."

  body: My general advice is not to use Private Use Area codepoints for variants of
    standard encoded glyphs. The PUA should be used only when you have some idiosyncratic
    symbol that is neither a standard encoded character nor a variant form of such
    a character. An obvious example would be a corporate logo in a font. The only
    time I use PUA characters is for decorative, ornament glyphs.
