body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>great site, been told to design this font.. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.acabusinesssolution.com/welcome/welcome.html"
  target="_blank">http://www.acabusinesssolution.com/welcome/welcome.html</a> <BR>
  <BR>ACA Pacific to ACW Solutions, ok i managed to do the &#34;W&#34; by copying
  the letter &#34;A&#34; and tilt it upside down worked effective but the Solutions
  is a nightmare cos i am not sure what font it is, but i looked in to Bodini its
  pretty close but still not 100% sure on it.  <BR> <BR>cheers <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47598.jpg"

  body: The shape of the lc &#34;a&#34; and the serifs make me think this  <BR>is
    a condensed version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/thorowgood-regular/thorowgood-ef-regular/testdrive.html?s=ACA%B7Pacific&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Thorowgood</a>, but unfortunately  <BR>I can&#39;t find a digital
    equivalent. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/annlie/extra-bold/testdrive.html?s=ACA%B7Pacific&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Annlie</a> might work as well.

  body: The top one is definitely ITC Fat Face, as passenger says. The bottom one
    appears an attempt to fake ITC Fat Face using Bauer Bodoni and doing some editing
    of the shapes.
