  body: Could the dog look happier? Mouth open, tongue out, suggestion of smile? This
    guy looks lonely. <BR> <BR>Outlining everything helps unify the logo, but has
    turned it into a unified jumble. Maybe &#34;Chicago&#34; is solid? <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t
    decide if I like the perspective effect. You&#39;ve got a lot going on already
    &#40;different typefaces, mixed case, dog intruding into the type&#41; that it
    might work better without it.

  body: I would add a serif and make it a capital I. For the outline, just fill in
    all the holes with black and it will be much clearer.
