  body: You asked what name is given to fonts like this, and there seems to be no
    uniformity in naming &#40;again&#41;. I have seen them called Handtooled, Engraved,
    Shaded, Open, Inline and Outline. These same terms can describe different forms
    of open styles, with uniform strokes or uneven ones, like this sample. <BR>
