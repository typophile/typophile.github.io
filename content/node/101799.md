  body: "I realize the request is for a fall-back at the operating-system level, but
    I wonder whether MS Word would honor it: I've tried repeatedly to disable MS Word's
    penchant for silently swapping fonts when it encounters a missing character, and
    would be glad to learn how.  I work mostly in InDesign, mostly in English but
    with bits of other languages, which I distinguish with character styles, in part
    to apply the correct hyphenation (via the language attribute).  Western languages
    I generally eye-ball, but I can isolate CJK strings with a GREP search: [\\x{2E80}-\\x{9FBB}]+
    \ This doesn't get everything, but I usually want to know about the chars. it
    misses; and I still must distinguish C, J, and K myself.\r\n\r\n\tCJK versions
    of InDesign offer a fancier way to control font usage, \"composite fonts\" (an
    unfortunate re-defininition of an existing term).  In-Tools' <a href=\"http://in-tools.com/products/plugins/world-tools-pro/\">World
    Tools Pro</a> brings this feature to western-language versions OF IDCS5 and later:
    according to the manual, \"Composite fonts allow you to select which fonts should
    be used for specific Unicode ranges to correctly display characters in many different
    languages while using only a single font.\"  (Note that standard Western-language
    installations of ID don't offer CJK language attributes, but they are carried
    along when one imports formatted text that includes the attribute.) \r\n\r\n"

    and generates an error in the preflight panel. I believe preflight in CS6 will
    generate a printable report of \"missing characters\" -- we use to have to run

    with the Chinese characters is is an Adobe font? Unit Pro is, best I can tell
    from a Google search, a FontFont font.\r\n\r\nI'll stand by the notion, the easiest
    way to keep any layout program from going & looking for a character in another
    font is to have it in the base font. If this is for \"corporate identity,\" perhaps
    they'll just have to pay the various font makers -- the Latin based & the Chinese
    -- for the privilege of making one font out of the two.\r\n\r\n(Note: For Cheap-A$$ed
    corporations, best would be to use OpenSource fonts. For our company, for example,
    I use a modified Charis for a number of our forms, invoices, etc.) "

    So in this case, you pay FontFont for the modified font, but not Adobe, and perhaps
    put a note in the corporate file for \"instructions to graphic designers\" to
    never, ever again buy/use one of the FontFont fonts. When it's your money, you
    get to make such decisions."

    better not be linked to something like a typeface, and they will know this. For
    branding, hire someone who hand letters. For work involving fonts, if you're large
    enough, either get a site license, or if you want to avoid such issues, hire graphic
    designers who will use fonts that don't lead you down such paths. Part of what
    you pay them for. And we're beginning to see this in University Press publishing,
    admittedly a market where no font publisher expects to find riches.\r\n\r\nThe
    whole notion is just \"needed\" as a bullet proof way around a technical problem.
    Technical situations/solutions are ever more encountered. Sometimes they're a
    way around a modification clause, sometimes modification solves a general non-geekiness
    of users, like me.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBTW, I even got the OK to modify the initial
    portion of two FF font families, Scala & Quadraat. It was the very early days

    San Francisco. Time was of the essence -- a journal was involved -- & everything

    text font\" to be included as part of a style definition for Latin text, as well

    \"helpfully\" but silently swapping in another font when the desired font lacks
    the intended character, regardless of language/script.  For me, the classic cases
    are macron vowels for romanizing Japanese, or <em>pinyin</em> tones not included
    among \"European\" accented vowels; or in CJK fonts, swapping in a font to access
    the 40,000 chars. added with CJK Ext. B.  InDesign, in contrast, highlights those
    situations with the \"dreaded pink boxes,\" and its Find Font feature makes it
    easy to track down and address every instance.\r\n\r\nI've also wondered whether
    MS Word's dual-language assignment might be what causes ID to screw up the language

    we're a typesetting house, and I would say that generally, neither authors nor

    One thing we do is to make an .rtf version of the text. We then import both the
