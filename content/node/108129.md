body: "Hi !\r\n\r\nI need suggestions for a swiss looking, geometric, sans-serif typeface:\r\n\r\n-Not
  TOO friendly like Brandon grotesque,\r\n-More modern looking than Futura,\r\n-The
  lowercase \"a\" has to be like the \"a\" from Futura,\r\n-Preferably \"o\"s like
  perfect circles.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really like \"GT Walsheim\" but I don't like the shape
  of the G and I want something just a little bit stronger.\r\nhttp://www.grillitype.com/typefaces/walsheim\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you!!\r\n\r\n"

    squares on top of the \"i\"s won't work either.\r\n\r\nI think I just need alternates
    to GT Walsheim actually!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Ju, too bad you dislike the G in our Walsheim. Just wanted to note that
    our EULA allows alterations to fonts as long as you keep them to yourself \u2013
    or you could of course request a customized version from us if the project budget
    allows for that."

  body: "@Thierry:\r\nThank you for the information. I unfortunately don't think the
    budget will allow customized typography. Walsheim was a great discovery for me
    and I hope I can use it in a future project.\r\n\r\n@Dezcom:\r\nThank you. I think
    this is very close to what I am looking for. I wonder if I could find something
    just a bit more unique. It is a project for a high end luxury-fashion client.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
