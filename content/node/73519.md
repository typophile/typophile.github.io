  fond of his current typeface which he says is 'Cosmic Sans'. (Not Comic Sans)\r\nI
  have been unable to track it down as a digital font.\r\nCan anyone confirm that
  this is in fact the name of this font?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coSmic_sans_5553.jpg]"
