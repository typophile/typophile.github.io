body: 'I submitted a logotype concept to a competition and although I got some good
  reviews, I was also told that the typography of the logotype is weak. I&#39;m a
  amateur/intermediate at logo creation, so I need some guidance at choosing the correct
  font. Oh, and also remember that I currently have pretty limited font supplies &#40;mostly
  the ones supplied with Corel Draw&#41;. I can only afford buying a great custom
  font if my entry wins the competition. <BR> <BR>Also check out my presentation &#40;in
  Estonian, but with loads of pictures&#41;: <BR><a href="http://www.magnus.pri.ee/info24/"

  body: The only typographic problem I see is the weight change because of size. And
    if you just make the &#34;2&#34; lighter that&#39;s solved. Or if you want the
    &#34;24&#34; to stand out, make the &#34;4&#34; darker. <BR> <BR>The asterisk,
    I would flip on its head. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Thanks for the feedback, Hrant. Actually the &#39;2&#39; is in the same size,
    it is just lower than the letters. And 4 is smaller than 2 because I cut a small
    piece off it.

  body: 'Magnus: <BR> <BR>I will reiterate what Hrant has said regarding both the
    asterisk and the numerals. The two may be the same size in mathmatical width/thickness,
    but visually &#40;perception is more important than reality in visual communication&#41;
    it is heavier. See the width of the angled stroke on the &#34;4&#34;? The width/thickness
    of the &#34;2&#34; should probably be somewhere between that and its current width/thickness.
    Also, does the curve on the &#34;f&#34; &#40;I&#39;m a novice at typography so
    I don&#39;t know whether this is referred to as a &#34;terminal&#34; on an &#34;f&#34;,
    or not&#41; feel a little thick/heavy or is it just me? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s looking
    pretty good. I hope you win your competition. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: Okay, lets see what I can do about the number 2. I will make it a bit smaller,
    since one of my objectives was to write the logo text in one colour. <BR> <BR>The
    curve of the &#39;f&#39; doesn&#39;t bother me, but if someone else points it
    out, then it probably  needs some work. <BR> <BR>By the way, I used Humanist 521
    font and the only modifications were the alignment of the 2 and cut 4.

  body: 'I don&#39;t think there are weight problems. <BR>My objection is that the
    4 seems like it&#39;s floating &#40;ie. not associated with any grid '
