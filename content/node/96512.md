  Lash Lazaar Show', long-running column in the tabloid the Majorca Daily Bulletin.
  So long-running in fact that this font may date from the late 60s. Sorry about the
  small image (it's from the net), but I thin you can make out enough detail. if not
  I can maybe make a bigger scan.\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheRikiLashLazaarShow_6196.jpg]"
