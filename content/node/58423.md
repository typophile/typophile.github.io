  already created a logo and have chosen the colors I would like to use, and today
  I brainstormed business card ideas:\r\n\r\nSet a.) http://i42.tinypic.com/1073qwy.jpg\r\n\r\nSet
  b.) http://i42.tinypic.com/291yve0.jpg\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any feedback about
  my ideas.\r\n\r\nAlso, can anyone recommend a typeface that you think suits my logo
  and colors? I am currently using FF Scala Sans but I am not sure if it is working."

    corners) were done in the same style, I would still not like it.\r\n\r\nRed on
    black or charcoal is a really nice choice, and overall layout is very likable.
    But that's IMO and [[http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3662/3429473040_8a995a228c.jpg?v=0|I
    might be biased]] .. :-))\r\n\r\nThe type is hard to comment on because the images
    are so tiny. Perhaps try uploading a larger image here (there's an Upload Image
    button underneath the comment entry box)."

  body: "I like the horizontal layout better. The cut corner on the vertical layout
    makes the logo look like it isn't centered, along with the type that isn't aligned
    with anything...horizontal works better.\r\n\r\nI think both red & black on that
    charcoal look great.\r\n\r\nAs for the  typeface, epsilicon is right, its kinda
    hard to see if this type works.\r\n\r\nJeo."

    align the logo and the type better."
