  body: "Me too. Do you have any more letters? The [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] should help, but all this gives me is the 'a' and an ambiguous
    'y' to use in the key letter search. I tried WhatTheFont with this image, and
    got bogus choices.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

    it because I kept picking the wrong y tail shape. I don't know what I was thinking
    when I coded it the first time. ;-(\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
