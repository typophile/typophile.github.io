		<div class="commentbody">Hey, nice! This is the future, actually - I mean SW that runs remotely. BTW, there's also a pretty advanced Flash bitmap font (I guess pixelfont) editor - I forget the URL. <BR> <BR>Two things: <BR>1) The Overlay On/Off doesn't seem to do anything. <BR>2) I can't get other chars to show up. When I hit a key there seems to be a lot of activity (HD churning), but the display just goes blank (except for the guides), and I can't even get back to the &quot;A&quot; (without a Reload). <BR> <BR>&gt; Georgia &hellip; is covered by Microsoft's EULA, which prohibits decompiling. <BR> <BR>I wonder what &quot;decompiling&quot; really is, though. What Nic is doing here seems to be equivalent to nothing more than something like a &quot;convert to outlines&quot; in Illustrator - there's no actual font action [that I can see]. Oh, but I guess you mean the initial conversion to XML&hellip; I get it. <BR> <BR>The good news is that MS isn't extremely strict about this stuff - you can't even save anything at all out in this instance, right? <BR> <BR>In the future though if it this is going to actually generate new fonts, including a public-domain font instead is indeed a good idea. Nic, the nice Bitstream people can help you out there. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

There would have to be a way for a user to load up a font from a local drive though. <BR> <BR>Also, I'd add a way to slide the overlay around without moving the other layer.

		<div class="commentbody">Nic, this is getting good! <BR> <BR>Question: Are you determining the vertical guidelines from parameters in the font, or manually? <BR> <BR>BTW, there was a guy (I should really remember exactly who it was, but all that comes to mind is that he was Latino - sorry) who was working on a PDF template that you would plug a font into and you could read off a bunch of useful attributes, like set-widths, vertical overshoots, etc. Can anybody find that stuff in the archives? The reason is that Nic might benefit by colaborating with whoever that was. <BR> <BR>&gt; is that a standard term in the industry <BR> <BR>You mean &quot;setting text&quot;? Yes, it always means using a font to lay out some text. <BR> <BR>&gt; I guess it would be less bothersome if the face were very different from Verdana. <BR> <BR>Less bothersome to us, but probably more bothersome to your typical user, who appreciates the &quot;convenience&quot;?  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Eduardo! (And sorry Hector&hellip;) <BR> <BR>Nic, what about uploading a normal font file and doing the TTX conversion internally? At least in that way chances are less people will end up with an &quot;unauthorized decompiled&quot; version of a font on their drive. <BR> <BR>BTW, of those features to add, to me Save is the least useful. Except of course as a way to save just the annotations (which would also take up a lot less space). Maybe this can be done with references to chars, without actually storing the glyph data? That's for cases where no outlines changes are made though. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
