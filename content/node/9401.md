  body: This looks like an extra condensed version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antiqua/urw-antiqua-t-extra-bold-narrow/testdrive.html?s=Chmpn&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">URW Antiqua</a>. I couldn&#39;t find one on either MyFonts or
    URW&#39;s site that was this condensed, though.
