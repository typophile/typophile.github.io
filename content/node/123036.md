    one handy thing to know: If you want to identify a webfont, you can select the
    text that uses it, right-click on your selection and then select \u2018Inspect
    Element\u2019 from the context menu (in Firefox and Chrome). The font name will
    be shown on the right-hand side in the panel at the bottom of the screen. You
    might want to click on the tab \u2018Fonts\u2019 in Firefox or \u2018Computed\u2019
    in Chrome for a neater overview.</blockquote>\r\nOther handy options: Chrome [[http://chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html|WhatFont]]
