  you produced expensive, frequently pirated software, you'd probably want the process
  for buying it to be as easy on the customer as possible, right? If you're Adobe,
  not so much. Yet another reader writes in to share her frustrations with trying
  to buy Adobe's Dreamweaver.</cite>\r\n\r\nI've never run into issues with upgrading
  or purchasing Adobe software (granted I don't do the purchasing). But it's interesting
  that a simple process of upgrading a single product [GoLive CS2 to Dreamweaver CS3]
  is giving this person such headaches. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else encountered similar
  issues?"

    either finds my the serial number from my previous version, or if it's an install
    on a clean drive, I type in the old one, then the new, let it do its thing, and
    I'm done.\r\n\r\nI guess my only issue is that I hate typing in those HUGE serial
    numbers.\r\n\r\nI have the occasional minor glitch installing other software,
    but nothing like she had. Her problems were quite annoying, but I think it's safe
    to say they're not the norm."

  body: "Sort of.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading to CS3 (I had CS and Macromedia's MX 2004
    Suite) I ordered a stand-alone upgrade for Fireworks, under the mistaken assumption
    that it would upgrade my Macromedia MX 2004 Suite version of Fireworks. The website
    and documentation I saw didn't suggest there would be any issues. After installing
    everything and proving that CS3 Design worked as advertised but Fireworks didn't,
    I called Adobe to find out why my Fireworks CS3 wasn't working.\r\n\r\nTurns out
    that the Fireworks CS3 upgrade only updates a stand-alone Fireworks license, not
    the MX 2004 suite license. Adobe said that I would need to purchase a new, full
    version of Fireworks. I didn't like that and I really didn't \"need\" Fireworks,
    so instead I went through the \"Adobe refunds me while I destroy my Fireworks
    CS 3 copy\" process. I discovered soon thereafter that several other people were
    effected by the same lack of information on the Adobe User-to-User forums. And
    shortly after that, Adobe put up additional information on the website to clarify
    that you couldn't upgrade to Fireworks CS3 using a Macromedia suite license. And
    they eventually did a special deal where if you bought the CS3 upgrade they would
    reduce the price on the full version of Fireworks.\r\n\r\nIn Adobe's favor, the
    service reps were very apologetic and professional. But the thing that still bugs
    me is that they didn't think creatively about how to solve my problem (I wanted
    an upgrade, not to buy a full new version!) and they could have completely avoided
    the entire issue if they had the right information online!\r\n\r\nAnd I don't
    want to even get started on the Adobe Acrobat \"Yahoo Search\" tool and FedEx
    Kinkos \"print\" button. Proof that marketing is taking over the engineers at
    Adobe..."

    3 days on the phone with Adobe to buy a font. \r\n\r\nAdobe is really no different
    than other giant software companies (or any other semi-monopolistic industry...yes
    I'm looking at you giant Telco and Cableco). \r\n\r\nThe support folks are good
    people, the company/system, not so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
