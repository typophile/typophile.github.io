  that features a famous person's penmanship? \r\nIt's called Mr. ______?\r\n\r\nThanks!
  It is driving me nuts."

    of some of the [[http://www.sudtipos.com/home|Bluemlein Scripts]] done by Ale
    Paul for Sudtipos/Veer. Half of those fonts are \"Mr.\" something, and they were
    based on actual handwriting samples, although not of famous people, as far as
    I know.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
