  fonts (to stand in as fallback substitutes for other missing fonts), and even know
  about the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/groups/adobesansmm/>Flickr group</a> to
  document sightings in the wild, but I'm curious to learn more about their history.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know who actually designed the fonts? Were they first introduced with Adobe
  Type Manager? What kind of license are they distributed with by default? I've poked
  around for info online, especially here on Typophile, but haven't found much."

  body: "Thanks so much for sleuthing around for the answers, Frank. I'm assuming
    you got the info from some longer-standing Adobe staff members?\r\n\r\nThough
    most designers groan at the sight of these fonts (after all, seeing them does
    usually mean something has gone wrong) I must say that the problem they solve
    is an interesting one. As you mentioned, they were purposefully made to be generic,
    but I think a lot of creativity still went into their design to get them to work
    as intended. Indeed, if they hadn't done a minimally reasonable job with the design,
    we probably wouldn't be seeing so many examples where the fonts make it out into
    the wild :)\r\n\r\nAs for the license, I'd be surprised if the legal team at Adobe
    didn't cover these fonts with some section in the EULA about bundled software
    or something like that."

  body: I've heard several times about how extreme the requirements for these fonts
    were. They had to be able to stand in for everything from the fattest, widest
    font designs to the most narrow and thin. If you've ever seen them getting used
    as a substitute for one of these extremes, you probably thought they looked terrible
    -- but the point is that they serve a dynamic range far outside the limits of
    what most designers consider when making an MM typeface.

  body: "Nick,\r\nhere are the bits I found out so far:\r\n\r\nAdobe Sans and Serif
    were originally introduced with Acrobat, to serve exactly the purpose you\u2019re
    describing above. While the fonts were not yet ready for the 1st release of Acrobat
    (instead, a MM version of Myriad could be found in there), they finally came with
    Acrobat version 2 (1994).\r\nThe fonts were designed by Fred Brady, but also Jim
    Wasco has done some work on the family.\r\nProbably the name of a designer didn\u2019t
    stick, as the fonts had to be as anonymous and as generic as possible. Also, the
    design concept being so constrained (having to cover everything from thin to black,
    condensed to wide) did probably not allow for a lot of creative involvement.\r\n\r\nThe
    fonts have not been modified in a long time, and still do their job (using MultipleMaster
    technology) in the latest version of Adobe Acrobat.\r\nAFAIK, there is no license
    for them, and I guess using them outside Acrobat might be too difficult for most
    people anyway. :)\r\n\r\n"
