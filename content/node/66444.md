  is probably hand lettered using a photo copier knowing Anton's-- the band's founder
  and artist-- design style.\r\n\r\nAnyone know a close equivalent that might work
  as a substitute with a little distressing and skewing?\r\n\r\n(a most incredible
  band, btw, if youve never heard of them -- search youtube for \"BJM\")\r\n\r\ntnx,\r\ndave
