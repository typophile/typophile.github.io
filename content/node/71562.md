    maybe someone can recommend a substitute.\r\n\r\nThis logotype appeared on SAAB
    automobiles from ~1963-1969:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saablogo_5741.jpg]\r\n\r\n..and
    an updated version on automobiles 1969-1972:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saab_logo_167_5871.jpg]"

    FB BoldCompressed</a> or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/weekend-tabloid/regular/>Weekend
    Tabloid Regular</a> as substitutes or as a start if you tweak the obvious differences
    on letters \"S\" and \"A\".\r\n\r\nNote that there is a slight difference on the
    two pictures I posted as well. I prefer the A on the latter one."
