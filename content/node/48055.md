  something for a friend who really likes the Papyrus font, but I'm trying to find
  an alternative that doesn't have the weathered look about it, but still has similar
  design. \r\n\r\nI'm searching through various fonts but I thought maybe someone
  out there might know of one off the top of their head?\r\n\r\nThanks heaps for any
  hints\r\n\r\nCheers"
