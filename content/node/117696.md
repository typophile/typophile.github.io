  body: 'Thank you. That helped. Appears that Digital Sans was created by the Brendel
    Type Studio around 1974-78. I would also be curious to hear any thoughts or opinions
    about this typestyle, if anyone is inclined to comment. '

  body: "Some more info about this type of letter form\r\n\r\n----start quote---\r\nBased
    on the classic Sol design by Marty Goldstein and C.B. Smith, published by VGC
    in 1973, Sol Pro goes above and beyond the call of revival/retooling to include
    plenty of optical improvements to the original design, more weights, italics,
    small caps, biform shapes, alternates, and extended language support.\r\n\r\nThis
    particular design is one of the more prominent forefathers and strong influencers
    of the soft, streamlined aesthetic that has been going strong in branding and
    geometric design for more than 40 years now. It cuts all links to melancholy and
    classic empire shapes, and introduces smooth contrast modulation that communicates
    sleek, adaptable youth, confidence, knowledge, and modern hi-tech presence. This
    is not your grandfather\u2019s Eurostile. This is your offspring\u2019s global
    hope, optimism, and total awareness.\r\n----end quote---\r\nsource: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sol-pro/\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks for the extra information. I have to confess that I am not a typestyle
    afficionado, but for some reason, on those few occasions where I need to use a
    specific font for a project, I like to know as much about its history as possible.
