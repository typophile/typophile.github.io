  far too many downloaded fonts. i try using suitcase to create a font catalog that
  i could perhaps print off, but it always finds a font that is corrupt and the whole
  thing goes bung (now there's a technical term). is there another piece of software
  or approach that other smarties out there use to do this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nthank
  you!"

    shop around for specimen books, \r\nand then, based on what you like from these
    books, collect only the fonts you really need."

    body: thanks ralf, i might give it a go. i must agree with dberlow though, i have
      far too many fonts, and a lot of them are rubbish, so hopefully i can weed them
      out!
