body: "I'm trying to figure out a way to get multiple variants of a character <i>in
  one single font file</i>. Or, to put it another way: can I put multiple font families
  (or weights) in one OTF/TTF file?\r\n\r\nMy goal is to reduce the number of requests
  a site has to make in order to retrieve all the used fonts. I'd only need about
  40 to 50 glyphs: the alphabet, the digits and the basic punctuation marks. I'm also
  willing to just use uppercase, so lowercase could be used for a different family.\r\n\r\nThis
  is specifically for web use.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, I would like to apply one font
  familty to this container, and have each line show up in a different typeface:\r\n\r\nHELLO,
  USER 123!\r\nHELLO, USER 123!\r\nHELLO, USER 123!\r\nHELLO, USER 123!\r\n\r\nI think
  it's not possible, but before I give up on this idea I wanted to check with you
  guys.\r\n\r\nI thought about and experimented with the following ideas:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Give
  each line one of the basic styles with CSS (normal, bold, italic, bolditalic) and
  instead of bold, italic or bolditalic glyphs, just use normal glyps of three other
  fonts. Can't be done because these have to be four separate font files.</li>\r\n<li>Modify
  the text so a different character inside the same font is used. Basically, the idea
  of uppercase and lowercase. This can easily be done in CSS and would work for A
  to Z, but not for numerals or puncutation. Also, it would be limited to two variants.</li>\r\n<li>Expand
  on that idea by somehow transforming everything to accented letters, so I'd have
  a, A, \xE4 and \xC4. I guess this only works for valid characters (a, but not m
  for instance). Also, this isn't triggerable from CSS, you can't say \"text-transform:
  umlaut\"</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI've also brainstormed about a way to merge these
  files into one with other tricks. I.e. use the same binary container but somehow
  only use part of the data. Kinda like mulit-part MIME, but for binary. But I guess
  a stable, cross-browser way to do this is impossible.\r\n\r\nThe best solution I
  have now is to simply use four different font files, but BASE64-ing them and sticking
  them inside one CSS file. This actually works very well and caches nicely, the only
  disadvantage is the BASE64 overhead.\r\n\r\nBut if there's a solution on OTF/TTF-level,
  I'd be very interested!"

  body: "@LiliCharlie: That's a very interesting idea, using <code>:lang</code>. I'll
    have to dig into browser support for this. Am I correct to think it works like
    this: <code>< element lang=\"fr\">abc< / element></code> will ask the render engine
    to get the glyphs for a, b and c, and the rasterizer/OTF will request these from
    the font, passing along the information that these should be the French version
    of these characters? If so: pretty cool.\r\n\r\n@Theunis de Jong: Very recent
    browsers are starting to support things like ligatures, alternates and swashes,
    but for now these are too experimental to rely on. But that would be a perfect
    solution for me. So this means you could technically put a normal and a bold version
    in one OTF file, and use bold by saying those are the historical forms, for instance?"

  body: "(Ab)using the Historical Forms for Bold is certainly an option, and there
    must be a few other \"common\" features that you might use this way. Most OTF
    features should allow combining with each other -- say, Oldstyle Numerals combined
    with Swash would use a total different glyph set than each on their own.\r\n\r\nBut
    the Stylistic Sets I was alluding to are a feature all on their own; twenty of
    them, in fact. They are unimaginatively named <code>ss01</code> to <code>ss20</code>
    (a fairly new option is a designer can give useful names to each) and they are
    specially defined for all  \"whatever you can think of\" glyphs and glyph combinations.\r\n\r\nSuppose
    you made 20 weights of your font, then you could assign one to each set."

      discussion on the W3C mailing list]] and it looks like it's not supported yet.
      Also, it looks like there's a little support for fragmented identifiers for
      SVG \u2014 images at least. That could allow us to merge font files into one
      SVG-file and pick the appropriate one in our <code>font-face</code> declaration
      by adding <code>#1</code> for the first font, <code>#2</code> for the second,
      etc.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the conclusion seems to be that there's no reliable
      cross-browser way of doing this, so BASE64'ing into one CSS file still seems
      to be the best option."
