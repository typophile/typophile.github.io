  and Chanson d'Amour made after Fourniers handwriting I believe. \r\n\r\nI have already
  contacted Lineto today if they still license Batarde Coule\xE9. I can't find it
  from their website anyways. Chanson d'Amour I have licensed before. It's nice but
  a little too thin for my needs.\r\n\r\nAre there any alternatives? A clean outlined
  one would be nice."

  body: "Thanks Renko. Got a reply from Lineto also, don't know why Batarde Coul\xE9e
    and couple of other fonts were offline.\r\n\r\nCezanne might work, but it isn't
    quite what I'm looking for. 1741 Financiere is nice, got to try it! Byron is also
    a little off.\r\n"
