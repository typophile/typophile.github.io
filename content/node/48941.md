    ;)</em>\r\nI think you are right about Antique Olive. Seems someone created their
    own, custom 'avantgardy' grunge version of it.\r\n\r\nDav\r\n"

  body: "Actually it is a fanfont called FarCry by Mike \"Gumby\" Anderson, based
    upon the computergame I think. (Remembered the quite unique C). \r\nThe base of
    it should be Antique Olive. (Won\u2019t link the fanfont, no, no). \r\n\r\nHere
    is the Readme: \r\n\r\nThis font is released as freeware. It is for personal non-commercial
    use (Duh...) I released this because I got tired of seeing the \"clone brush\"
    sigs on the farcry forums ;) he he. Now you have a font! Use it to supplement
    the web-kit supplied by Ubisoft. Mod authors who use this font in their mods are
    asked to give me a mention in the credits, Thanks.\r\n\r\nI have tried to recreate
    the look of the original font, which is pretty hard to do when you only have the
    letters \"FARC, and Y\". I am sure the Crytek/Ubi guys have a font, so I figured
    we should have one too. Took a while to find the root font, then I started from
    there. I was just going to release a package of Photoshop Custom Shapes, then
    I decided on a font. I still have the custom vector shapes for anyone who wants
    them.\r\n\r\nThe font is mainly uppercase, there are two lower case letters \"f\",
    and \"c\" the upper case versions of these letters are taller, the \"F\" is higher,
    and the \"C\" hangs lower. Use the lower case versions when you want them to resemble
    the rest of the uppercase letters. The remainder of the lowercase letters are
    symbols and logos from the game. The ducky is even there... hehe\r\n\r\nI will
    be modifying this font and adding more detail as I have more time. If you see
    any glaring errors, or have comments/criticisms let me know at the address above.\r\n\r\nNow
    the legal mumbo jumbo... (I couldn't fit it all in the descriptor for the font)\r\n\r\n\xA9
