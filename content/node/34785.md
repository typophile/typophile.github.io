  an ancient operating system and can't find Typophile's \"Search\" feature.\r\n\r\nI
  am curious about something I just noticed on MyFonts: two \"new\" typefaces that
  are actually updates of pre-existing ones, but with new names...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/loose-caboose-nf/\"><strong>Loose
  Caboose NF</strong></a> is actually Seymour Chwast's Artone, while <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/flap-jacks-nf/\"><strong>Flap
  Jacks NF</strong></a> is an update of Black Jack, by Vincent Pacella...\r\n\r\nWhile
  both designers are credited by Nick Curtis, I wonder if it isn't confusing to rename
  these typefaces.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

  body: There is already a digital font called Black Jack - http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/black-jack/
    - that may be why it was renamed.

  body: Nick has credited the source of his adaptation, rekindled interest in the
    typeface, and left the door open for Chwast to publish an authentic font of Artone
    under its original name.

  body: "All good points, Nick S., and if those were Nick C.'s intentions, all good.
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand... I guess my thinking was, why didn't he just
    call his versions <strong>Artone NF</strong> and <strong>Black Jack NF</strong>?
    For example, there are <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bernhard+script\"><strong>different
    versions of Bernhard Script</strong></a>, and the different foundries that produce
    them call them <strong>Bernhard Script URW</strong> or <strong>Bernhard Brushscript
    SG</strong>. And there are tons of Garamonds, but most of them include \"Garamond\"
    in their names, whether they are called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stempel-garamond/\"><strong>Stempel
    Garamond</strong></a> or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-garamond/\"><strong>Adobe
    Garamond</strong></a>.\r\n\r\nSo, is there some other reason, perhaps a legal
    one, for the new names? Was Nick C. required to get permission (or pay hefty amounts
    of the folding green stuff) to re-issue these fonts in a digital version with
    their original names? Or some other reason along these lines? Just wondering."

    revival of <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000096#about"><strong>Hellenic
    Wide</strong></a> on Veer's site... Besides the fact that I love the new <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000095">inline
    version</a> that he's created, I notice that he has not gone and renamed the face.  :-)

  body: If you're doing a revival I think it's sensible to avoid using a name that
    someone may be able to claim rights over, even if there is no formal trademark.
    However untrademarkable names like Hellenic (descriptive) and Garamond (historic)
    are considered fair game.
