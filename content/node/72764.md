body: "Okay so I have on my Macbook Pro Suitcase Extensis and my fonts are organized
  - say - by Designer.\r\nThe folders are labeled with designer name first - then
  the name of the font.\r\nI have a new Macbook with Suitcase and I'd like to take
  my entire font library and put in on this computer the same way.\r\nThe problem
  is when I click and drag these folders they all lose their folder name and are put
  into one folder \"collected fonts\"....The font name becomes the name of the folder
  and not the Designer - font name as shown.\r\nI have also tried using the export
  feature and can't seem to figure this out.\r\nHow can I get these labeled folders
  onto my new macbook without losing my labels?\r\nthanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts_5692.png]"

    single family with custom names (which you are calling \"folders\" but are intended
    to be family names).\r\n\r\nThat's an unusual thing to do with the Suitcase Fusion
    ability to rename families, renaming all of them. I'd go so far as to say it's
    not something that was seriously thought about when developing the product. Offhand,
    I'm not coming up with any easy way to preserve this. You might want to contact
    Extensis tech support, but the one TS fellow I asked about this couldn't think
    of anything.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n(Extensis guy)"

  body: crapola. so you use extensis eh? mind if i see how you organize your files?
    do you do designer names? i like having designer names because it's easy to flip
    to my favorite designers - sometimes the foundry is different and there is no
    "tab" for designers...

  body: "BTW, all this could have been done with sets, or perhaps by using keywords.
    It was the use of the family renaming capability that isn't working out very well
    with migrating to another system.\r\n\r\nI do think it would be a Very Good Thing
    for Suitcase Fusion to be able to preserve customized family names in the migration.
    It's just that in normal usage, there aren't a zillion of them, so it's not a
    huge problem.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
