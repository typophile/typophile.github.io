  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The theme is 1967/1968 gangster. Imagine a very Brigitte Bardot/Faye Dunaway looking girl against the door of an Astin Martin, quietly holding a gun. Think gangsters, elegant, British...

What I am looking for are typefaces that would be evocative of this—work in this period. Of course, the 1930’s Bonnie & Clyde visual comes to mind, but I am looking for something more late 60’s.

Any ideas or suggestions?</div>

<a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/153/1033074.jpg">MEAN STREETS</a>

or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/itc-busorama-bold/bold/index.html">BUSORAMA</a> also smacks of the 60s.

I just don't equate "elegant British" with "60s gangster babe",  unless you mean more of the "Mrs. Emma Peale" appeal.

Then again, you could go for that script look in <a href="http://imagesource.allposters.com:80/images/MG/144164.jpg">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>.

After re-reading your request for typeface suggestions, I forgot to ask you the obvious:

Is this for print such as posters?
or
Is this for cinema screen, such as movie titles?

		<div class="commentbody">Norbert's Busorama was what jumped to my mind too. A lot of the gangster aesthetic after a certain point was gaudy, retro pastiche, rather than distinct style (or taste). In my mind's eye, I see the gangsters of that era (visually) as tacky echoes of the post-War (think Godfather I) era gangsters...

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, crugen,

that's why (letters) Christian Palino's request for a design that was evocative of 1967/1968  "gangster, elegant, British" seemed a bit incongruous to me. 

Instead of "gangster," perhaps Christian's thinking was more like "heist" since he seemed interested in the <em>Thomas Crown Affair</em> poster. Heists by elegant, dashing characters was a popular movie theme of the 60s & 70s.

I'm also waiting to see if Christian will offer us more insight into the project he is planning for.

Right Chris, I don't recall Brit gangsters being a media thing in the 60s, apart from the Krays, who were too close for comfort. Speaking of whom, David Bailey, another East End lad, had photographed them in the mid 60s. He also shot the Stones, so that gives me a mod, Compacta/Impact vibe. The Krays were hardcore psycopaths, and once the full nature of their crimes became apparent in court (eg slicing off people's faces), their glamour disappeared (for 20 years, at least). Get Carter is an awesome film, but after the 60s. There is a definite fault line there, somewhere around the Beatles breaking up.  I think the Get Carter typeface in its poster is Gill Kayo.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick,
You are right about the Get Carter typeface on the original poster (I was looking at a video cover which used Eurostile which at least is of the period and stylish). But I don't think anyone would expect a gangster to be equipped with an Aston Martin or Bardot, while Carter had a Jag and Britt in 1971 not that far from 68. A more obvious reference would be the Italian Job (attractive cars and women) which was made before the need for an identity was regarded as a necessary marketing tool to a movie – the original British poster was a blocky almost constructivist sans, while another British one was almost Brody-esque and the American one looks like a Didone.
BTW Avant Garde was produced in the early 1970s wasn't it?

Commercially available, yes.
However, Herb Lubalin had used it in the magazine for several years by then.
The Avant Garde logo, from which the face evolved, dates from 1967.</div>
