  multiple fonts.\r\nIt visualizes a selection of letters side by side and puts it
  into a PDF for visual comparison. If visual comparison isn\u2019t enough for you,
  it dissects what\u2019s there and what\u2019s not and puts that into simple graphs.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yanone.de/typedesign/autopsy/"
