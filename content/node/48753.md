  body: "The lowercase \"s\" in Avant Garde is so narrow that it looks like a mistake.
    If it were me, I'd pick a different typeface. There are a lot of other sans serifs
    out there that are clean and modern (Avant Garde looks really dated) and that
    don't suffer from the \"s\" problem. Avenir might be a better choice.\r\n\r\nThe
    yellow seems to be fine for that shape on the top right, but it seems to be a
    little too light for \"natural\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I second Jonathan's opinion, Your font choice does seem dated, experiment
    some more with that. \r\n\r\nAlso overall it feels a little off balance. The green
    shape looming  over the word \"natural\" makes me think of a boulder teetering
    on a cliff. Did you try reversing the two shapes - so the natural/organic shape
    is over the word \"natural\" and the half a capsule is over the word \"prescription\"?
    \r\n\r\nYour color palette has that fresh, organic, natural feel. However the
    yellow might be tough to read at small sizes, on a business card for example."

    those two shapes are meant to symbolize 'N' and 'P' in an abstract fashion.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I didn't see the abstract N and P at all, thanks for pointing that out Arcturus.
    As I go back and re-evaluate the design, now I really want to see the font replaced.
    \ One where the negative space is more clearly reflective of the above shapes.
    \r\n\r\nN and P's, or leaf and capsule, it still looks unbalanced, like the icon
    is crushing the type. However, with a type change this comment may become moot.
    Or perhaps it's just a size/scale issue - it's a good start Tom just play around
    a little more."
