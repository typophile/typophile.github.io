  didn't have any type in my collection that served my needs. Some folks around the
  studio seemed to like what I had done and suggested that I complete the set to create
  a simple display font. I went ahead a drew some additional characters.\r\n\r\nI'm
  a rookie. I would like some feedback.\r\n\r\nI have attached a PDF so that anyone
  who interested in taking a close look can get a better feel of the amount of contrast,
  etc.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/morecond.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Gene.\r\nIt looks simple and elegant to me. Interesting how you've kept
    all crossbars at the same hight. Number '9' and letters 'P' and 'R' stand out
    a bit because of this. I prefer the rounded 'W' and the sharp 'V' (as obviously
    you do too). Any ideas for lower case? \r\nGood luck!\r\n/M\xE5rten"

  body: I think the light version is not that good, but it works. The bold one is
    very nice. The B is too angular compared to the other letters.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. I did take a whack at a lower case. They are sketches.
    A good deal of tuning is needed but I think the basic ideas are there. Also, the
    punctuation may need to be adjusted to better work with the lower case. \r\n\r\nSeems
    the bolder version is more desireable. I think that i will adjust the lighter
    version so that it has a greater amount of contrast - being that the original
    concept sprung from a need for a set of characters that were very light in weight,
    condensed and had a space/future/NASA kind of feel.\r\n\r\nthanks again for the
    comments. keep em coming. No holds barred - I want to learn.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/morecondLC.jpg]"
