  it was just drawn - but I really don't want to! And then I kick myself a bit, how
  many times over I COULD have drawn it myself in the time searching.....\r\n\r\nCan
  someone help me identify this font please? I thought for sure it was in my library
  then realized it was probably Futura Bold that I was thinking of. This font seems
  to have more vertical curves......\r\n\r\nThanks so much\r\nGTC"
