<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am interested in the roots of Akzidenz Grotesk, a truly seminal typeface for the development of sanserif, considered anonymous by various sources. <br> <br>According to typolexicon.de, the "Royal Grotesk", by German typographer Ferdinand Theinhardt is its direct precursor. Do you know any publication or website where I could find a specimen of this typeface? <br> <br>In broader terms, talking about the context in which it appeared, Robert Bringhurst in "The Elements of Typographic Style" relates it to the Realist movement in art. Do you know of any other source in which this is further discussed? <br> <br>Thanks a lot <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>the Caslon sans of the 1820s, so praised for its early appearance, has no real relevance. <br> <br>Huh? The guy invents a major genre and it's irrelevant?! The sans is present in the specimen books of UK typefounders (I'm not familiar with other countries, but I would imagine the same situation) from the 1830s, and in steady use, especially advertising, subsequently. <br> <br>Caslon's sans had a very geometric quality -- circular Os and straight-legged R etc. Figgins sans's of the 1830s show an indecision between geometric and grotesque qualities, with versions at different sizes leaning one way or the other. <br> <br>Those earliest sans were Bold and Caps only, and appear to have been used mainly for contrast, in text work. The most popular early sans was probably the Bold Condensed style, used in a range of sizes, particularly in commercial jobbing. Regular weight sans faces were used in the 1840s. <br> <br>I suspect that the introduction of lower case to the sans genre pushed it in a grotesque direction, as the world was not ready for a geometric lower case at that time (the 3rd quarter of the 19thC), when the radical tone of the early century had become more conservative. <br> <br>AG is well-known for the logic of its systematic family, and it is tempting to equate this modernist idea with the sans genre -- however, almost no-one used sans faces for text in 1900. In fact it was the massively popular Cheltenham that lead the way in being a face with a large family that you could set an entire job in: heads, decks, subheads, and text.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In my opinion, we could talk about two different approaches to the grotesque, one developed mainly in the UK and USA, and the other in Germany, that follow different lines. <br> <br>As I see it, the first develops in the UK from the Caslon breakthrough, and represents the modulated, less geometrical approach, that has in Franklin Gothic its paradigm. The tipology of this line remains fixed through time. Thus Trade Gothic (1948) and News Gothic (1908) belong to the same formal category. <br> <br>The German grotesques of the XIX century, like Akzidenz Grotesk, tend to geometry and monoline anatomy, and a more systematic development of the range of weights. I think this ascetic approach fitted more the rationalist modern spirit of the XX century typographic avant-gardes. Thus, this grotesque tipology evolved in time into neogrotesque (Helvetica, 1957), by absorbing the influences of the technical and aesthetical proposals of those avant-gardes. <br> <br>Of course, this comparison has nothing to do with a value judgement, in terms of one being "better" than the other in any way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Xurxo <br> <br>One slight problem with the Caslon "breakthrough." The type was shown on a specimen only as an information marker and not a face that was offered for sale. It is thought by some historians to be a dead link. There are other earlier examples but they were seemingly only found in stone cutting. <br> <br>More likely there was some form of interplay of influence between styles offered from different countries. <br> <br>For instance. The Americans who developed decorative wood type based it on British metal type imports which were in turn derived from French decorated typefaces and then Dutch, at about the turn of the century and very early 1900s. The popularity of American wood type in turn resulted in metal type foundries churning out a lot of similar decorated styles. <br> <br>Sometimes the string of influence is just not a straight line. <br> <br>Gerald</div>

<div class=commentbody>(No coments to your argument, Gerald. Thank you for it.) <br> <br>In words of Erik Spiekermann ( <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/552.html target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/552.html</a> ), "Schelter Grotesk" was the actual model for Helvetica (not Akzidenz). Do you know any source where I could find a specimen of this typeface? <br> <br>Helvetica was originally called Neue Haas Grotesk, and was a direct redesign of a previous "Haas Grotesk", itself based on AG. Any source for a specimen of this one? <br> <br>Thanks again</div>

<div class=commentbody>From what I've read (mainly Carl-Fredrik Hultenheims essay in Biblis, 1986) the work to 'modernize' the sans serif started at Hermann Berthold AG in Berlin 1896; it became Akzidenz Grotesk/Standard, and was followed by 13 different weights/versions. However, it lacked the systematic approach its american counterparts. <br>The background story really seems to be vague, but one story goes it was influenced by the poster letters designed by architect Josef Hoffmann at Wiener Werkst</div>

<div class=commentbody>I had the pleasure of meeting and studying with Wolfgang Weingart in the mid 80s. He told me about discovering a few old, dusty, forgotten job cases of AG in the bowels of the type shop in Basel. He described how he had "awakened them from sleep" and began a long partnership with the fonts. You can see examples of his work with the quite extraordinary (and to my mind best) version of AG in his book "Weingart: Typgraphy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi I'm new here. By chance I was Googling to find information on AG and found this thread (and this great site). <br> <br>Regarding the different versions and descendants of AG, does anyone know how AG Book and AG Schoolbook fit in to the picture? In particular, AG Schoolbook has quite a few marked differences with other AGs (e.g. lowercase "a") so it seems there must be an interesting story on the impetus of this AG variant. <br> <br>This has been on my mind for a while and I even tried contacting Berthold a few times about this and I've never got a response. <br> <br>Thanks to anyone who can provide some background.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The rubberstamp image is from:
Bruckmann's Handbuch der Schrift
Erhardt D. Stiebner, Walter Leonhard unter Mitarbeit von Johannes Determann...[et al.]
München : Bruckmann, 1985
Sorry about the two year delay. The book was from a library.
http://typophile.com/node/17643
Brought me back here. Great info there too.
The Book of Type and Design by O. Hlavsa (1960) has a sample of a grotesk "cast by the Swiss Haas Foundry", but it appears to be Schelter & Giesecke grotesk (like FF Bau). Is there a connection or is it just confusion?
Another interesting related grotesk is Genzsch & Heyse Blockschrift:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GHblocksch.png]
Does anyone know the year it first appears? This sample is from a late 1910's specimen book.

Nach der Übernahme der Haas'schen Schriftgießerei durch die D.Stempel AG, Frankfurt am Main wurde die Schrift dort unter dem Namen Helvetica ins Programm genommen und gleichzeitig im Jahr 1961 um die vielen anderen Schnitte erweitert und zwar parallel in Frankfurt am Main und in Münchenstein, Schweiz.

<div class=commentbody>No, it's OK. All the other information is correct. Somewhere, at the beginning of the chain—probably where Georg got his info in the first place—there is a typo. That's all ;-)
It isn't too serious. Imagine if Helvetica <strong>had</strong> been drawn in the 1930s. Boy, those Swiss boys would've been onto something.</div>

This is another interesting thing. They used to have trendy Art Nouveau/Jugend versions of the grotesks. Switch those characters and the typeface turns into "Botha". Sample from the next spread:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Botha.png]
Schelter & Giesecke went further with "Columbus":
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Columbus.png]
Those Swiss boys must have shaken their heads.
<cite>Standard</cite>
My Standard "specimen no 539 A" reads "made in Germany by Berthold type foundry... Imported and distributed by Amsterdam continental types and graphic equipment inc." I Can't find the year of printing, which is a common problem with type specimens. I believe its from the fifties.

<div class=commentbody><em>Gerstner program was released by Berthold for Diatype, I guess in 1957 after Univers, Before Helvetica... </em>
It certainly wasn't. Diatype was still being developed then. The first usable machines came onto the market in 1961. Gerstner Programm was designed in 1967.
<em>Where these stamps came from? Berthold? Linotype?</em>
These are obviously rubber stamps, set into a composing stick-type-of-device after the individual letters had been stamped onto the ink pad. The whole stick with the rubber letters inside it was then turned around and pressed onto paper or any other material. The sample says "Lettering for windows, displays, exhibitions, shops".
There was another material, called Plakadur, Plakat being the German word for poster. It was a wood/plastic composite that Berthold made its larger "wood" type from. They had a beautiful, fairly light cut of Akzidenz Grotesk Medium which was used for showcard printing machines. They were produced by a small company and sold to department stores for printing large labels, showcards, price cards. Essentially, you placed the type into the bed of the machine, inked it, put the paper on top of the type and ran a pressure roller over it, like a small proofing press. Apart from AG Medium, the had other Berthold faces, e.g. Herold, Block Condensed and Fanfare (by Louis Oppenheim, the Lo-Schrift – now LoType – designer).</div>

<div class=commentbody>"It was released in the U.S., I believe by ATF, as Standard"
Sorry for my geezer brain fart error before. It was Univers I was thinking of that was released by ATF, not Standard as I mistakenly said before. I still have visions of those large green cards with all the weight specimens :-/

<div class=commentbody><em>does anybody has ANY idea where i can get a set of those? or places where i could search? or even just if there was a special name for them?</em>
As I wrote earlier, they were rubber stamps or made from a composite material, sold under various trade names. One company in Germany was called Neoprint by Gröner GmbH. They made sets in Plakadur and rubber, but i haven't seen them used since the 1980s. They're not made anymore, but – like everything else – probably available on eBay et al.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the keywords and correcting me Erik.
In the book Visual language Gerstner doesn't mention Helvetica, but Univers as influence so I thought it was from those times.
Gerstner writes:
"Berthold marketed the new old Akzidenz-Grotesk as Gerstner Program - in photolithography; in other words, on the very first photolitography machine called Diatype. This cumbersome piece of equipment was soon replaced by a better one. And with that, the Gerstner Program disappeared from the market."</div>

<div class=commentbody>It very nice to see the thread reviving two years later.
I attach a specimen of a "Breite halbfette Grotesk" by the Schelter&Giesecke foundry, c.1898 (I guess this is related to the Schelteresche Grotesk, the base for FF Bau, as discussed early in the thread.)

<div class=commentbody>i found the following spread in an undated bauer specimen book. ("Hauptprobe: unsere Schriftgiesserei- und Messing-Erzeugnisse: Fabriken in Stuttgart, Berlin SW, Wien, St. Petersburg und Moskau / Bauer & Co., Stuttgart"). at the bottom left it reads "To highlight passages you can use Accidenz-Grotesk on the right side (Page 353). Both typefaces have "the same line"". yes, they say "have the same line".
the cover of the book is Bauer only (a great embossement), but inside there is the H. Berthold AG note on the bottom of every page. whats the ca. date of this? the library couldnt date it.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/royal_grotesk_bauer_6208.jpg]
you can find the full spread <a href=http://www.art.ificial.ch/mixed%20temporary/type/royal_grotesk_bauer.jpg>here</a>. i cannot garantuee how long this will stay online, so download it if you want to have it.
its a photo of a photocopy, so dont expect too great things.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This thread and a few others were amazing until about a half hour ago. I was writing a paper on Akzidenz Grotesk myself, and all this conflicting history was blowing my mind, it was like reading a mystery novel about a font. Unfortunately, my professor told me another student chose the same font as me, and I have been reassigned.
It's not all bad though. I might be a few days behind on the project but I got reassigned FF Meta.</div>
