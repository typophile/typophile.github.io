  body: ' One problem with the &#34;S&#34;, especially in the versions where the top
    arm stretches across above the other characters, is that &#40;to my eye&#41; the
    resulting design reads as &#34;CREAM&#34; with a frame-like flourish rather than
    as the intended &#34;SCREAM&#34;. <BR> <BR>The rest of the design looks great,
    though. I especially like the font used for &#34;cutz&#43;buzz&#34;. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' I love the curiousity to explore the letterforms of a font out of the box.
    SuperDuper is really nice and most designers would have just settled, but you
    took it further. Kudos. <BR> <BR>Flipping lc &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39; as part
    of the exploration, reworking the uc &#39;R&#39; and notching the lc &#39;e&#39;
    is nice.  <BR> <BR>One letter pair that I liked that didn&#39;t make the cut was
    the original lc &#39;am&#39; pairing. Very fluid. <BR> <BR>using a &#39;&#43;&#39;
    in cutz &#43; buzz works well, too. <BR> <BR>bj '
