body: A fine old Victoria printer, Morriss Printing Ltd., is making some of its letterpress-related
  equipment and supplies available for purchase. Included are metal fonts &#40;both
  lead and brass&#41;, proof presses, cutters, storage, and etc. Although a &#34;garage
  sale&#34; is planned for November 1 and 2 at 1745 Blanshard Street, you can sneak
  an early look by phoning Keijo &#40;pronounced kay-oh&#41; Isomaa at 250 656 2807
  and arranging a mutually convenient time. There is a lot of certified &#34;cool&#34;
  stuff.
