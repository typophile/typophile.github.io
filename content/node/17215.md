  on a font I've been playing with for some time. I'm not sure about the widths of
  'A', 'Z' and 'z'. 'K' and 'k' might be a bit too wide, but I sort of like them.
  Shouldn't 'K' be more consistent with 'R'?\r\nThe numerals.. are they legible enough?
  \r\nAny feedback appreciated.\r\n\r\nhttp://komercja.com/flukst/f1.htm"

  body: "First thing: if this is for setting paragraphs (as opposed to buttons and
    such) make your interletter spacing 2 pixels, not 1. This might seem counter-intuitive,
    but it's the key to readability (at any PPEM above 9, especially for a widish
    font like this, especially at 1-pixel stems). If you're worried about economy
    (which applies a lot less to [onscreen] text than buttons) then it's actually
    better to make your letters narrower.\r\n\r\nI might give the lc ascenders one
    more pixel (and then raise the bar of the \"f\").\r\nBut leave the cap height
    where it is.\r\n\r\nMake the \"t\" and the \"f\" wider.\r\nThe \"f\" doesn't need
    more right sidbearing though.\r\n\r\nCaps: the \"R\", \"X\" and \"Z\" are unhappy.
    The \"N\" is too wide.\r\nIf you're worried about the \"A\" looking too narrow,
    lower its bar.\r\n\r\nThe numerals are actually very very good.\r\nYou might just
    try lowering the waist of the \"4\".\r\n\r\nNo time to look at the non-alphanumerics,

    wider - good idea. That's probably one of the tiny details that decide about legibility.
    \r\nNot so sure about extended ascenders, will have to try. \"X\" - I didn't think
    about it this way before, but every font I look at now has the bars cross in the
    middle, I guess I must be doing something against the rules there. \r\nI'm considering
    lowering \"R\" and \"P\"'s waist. \r\nAs for \"A\", the bar was lower before and
    I thought that raising the bar  actually \"stretched it's legs\". I'd better leave
    it as it's now.\r\nThank you for your hints, they refreshed my view at the font."

        an \"extended\" (adding one pixel space) version of a pixel font, is not needed
        at all. \r\n\r\nSince web designers / developers will use them within Photoshop
        and Flash, if your font is developed at 1000 UPM size and the grid step is
        at 125 (125x125 = 1 pixel) then it will be used at size 8.\r\n\r\nSo in Photoshop
        if you set the tracking of the normal pixel font at 125, you will have an
        extended version, thus having one more pixel space in each glyph. If you set
        it at 250 you will have 2 pixels space and so on...\r\n\r\nIn Flash you do
        this by entering 1 in the tracking field for adding one pixel space to each
        glyph, 2 for adding two pixels space and so on...\r\n\r\n;o)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen
        i will have my pixel fonts ready i intend to have as much guide info for using
        pixel fonts as i can..."

    design being a largely servile craft, it's\r\nuseful to tame -although never ignore-
    one's preferences.\r\nIt really is true that in this case (and really most such\r\ncases)
    two-pixel spacing will improve readability.\r\n\r\nThe use of \"Extended\" is
    indeed a sort of pseudo-standard,\r\nbut it's quite an unfortunate one, and not
    <cite>too</cite> widely spread.\r\nExcept for perhaps a minor font-menu advantage,
    there's every\r\nreason to do the right thing and call them what they are: Tight/Loose.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you must keep the confusing terminology,\r\nat least make the 2-pixel-space

    are often \"boundary conditions\" that need to be exceptions (like the right side
    of the \"r\"). Brute tracking adjustments tend to throw off kerning as well (and
    Mana for example has 1400+ kern pairs).\r\n\r\nAlso, for fonts that -properly-
    have 2 pixels of interletter space, using negative tracking to get a Tight version
    can lead to collisions.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
