  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone,
I&rsquo;m a Graphic Design student, and i&rsquo;ve always loved type. From time to time, I&rsquo;ve tried creating my own typefaces on paper. Problem is, i&rsquo;ll create a few letterforms and then when I try to expand beyond that, the letters start to lose their resemblance to my original idea. So I guess my question would be&hellip;what&rsquo;s a good letter to start with? I usually start with a lowercase A, but is there a better starting point to help maintain consistancy among the letterforms? I browse free font sites a lot, and see a lot of HORRIBLY designed fonts, and I would rather produce something a professional designer might actually use. Also, any general tips or books I should pick up would be great as well.
Thank you all,
Eric</div>

<p>According to Tobias Frere-Jones, the &ldquo;classic approach&rdquo; is to begin with H and O, then R.</p>
<p>Carter likes to start with h and o, then p and d, then maybe v.</p>
<p>The article goes into a bit more detail about why those strike the designers as good places to start. I recommend it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m going to sound like a total dick for saying so, but only a complete novice would draw the alphabet in order: abcdefgh etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to draw a typeface on paper, and quite another to draw a typeface in software. Personally, when I&rsquo;m drawing a typeface on paper, the letters come out in no order, and I don&rsquo;t direct them; one thing leasds to another. For giggles, here&rsquo;s what I have drawn in my sketchbook. (Each line is a different page):
knitsse / efagior / EDL / n
ANSWER / WW
FJ / MMN / ZZ WVY / FFFZFJ / TZ
245011 / 786 ENC / E 3 q 6
2 21 / 5 4 478 / 8336
verygaaa / V V U A B / D R P Q S / X S T
01233445 / 222229 / 97778 / 88614
k kentis / ornacri / koikiva
village / ubibir / r rare
af affluent / f azimxu / yungli</p>
<p>Makes no sense, of course</p>
<p>When drawing letterforms in FontLab or FreeHand, the n and o are starting points. From there you&rsquo;re led to make h, l, r, u, and m, as well as p, d, b, q&hellip; Things lead to other things which suggest still other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to know how many people drawn randomly versus those who have a plan of attack&hellip;</p>

<p>I hate to say it but, if that&rsquo;s the case, you probably didn&rsquo;t have a very clear idea to begin with. Well-designed typefaces generally follow well-defined rules. Try to determine what those rules are, and the rest comes pretty easily.</p>

<p>Maybe, but there&rsquo;s also the paradox that <cite>things change</cite> when you go from certain modes of drawing/painting/whatever to digital outlines. The severe exactitude of the latter (in constrast to the interpretation-inviting fuzziness of the former) typically imparts a particular -and often unexpected- flavor to the results. And lack of experience with this can lead to a sense of confusion concerning &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo; and &ldquo;how do I fix this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That supports part of Chester&rsquo;s argument - even you were a novice at one time. ;-) What may be of interest is why you didn&rsquo;t change your practices over the years?</p>

<p>This is true; however, since our inquisitor in this forum is a design <strong>student</strong>, I presume that he (again, I presume) may never have had the opportunity, which was actually a <em>necessity</em> for those of us who began our careers in the pre-digital days, of actually working with pens, pencils, drafting tools and the like.</p>
<p><em>only a complete novice would draw the alphabet in order</em></p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not; on the other hand, perhaps only a complete fool would believe that there&rsquo;s a certain magic formula which must be followed to ensure font success. Back in ye olden days when I was doing only freeware fonts, I took notice of the words of Ray Larabie, who&ndash;at the time&ndash;was the king (or at least the most prolific) of the freeware fontmakers. His particular formula was to start with the lowercase h; from there, saith The Ray, all other letters flowed. However, when I attempted to follow this sage advice, it seemed to me that the only things that flowed naturally were m, n and, occasionally, r. So maybe I&rsquo;m a dope, but the Larabie method didn&rsquo;t work for me. More often than not, what <strong>does</strong> seem to work for me is to begin with the uppercase I, especially if it&rsquo;s a serif face: once I nail it, the same basic form can be used on 20 other letters&ndash;a slightly better payoff than two or three. But that&rsquo;s just me&hellip;</p>
<p>If Nick Shinn&rsquo;s A-to-Z method works for him, then his method is beyond reproach. So, yes, Chester: you <strong>are</strong> a total dick for assuming your way is the only way, as are the Mac users who assume that their OS is the only OS, as are the PC users who assume that their OS is the only OS, and so on. In terms of how one chooses to tackle a project, the best approach FOR YOU is the one that works FOR YOU. After all, we&rsquo;re talking typography here, not religion&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I usually get any visual input (be it an other font, graphics design, some scribbles, architecture, etc.), and this is my starting point.</p>
<p>This input also decides which letter i draw first (on paper yet). The scribbling is terrible, not to be comparable to other scribblings I see here on typophile sometimes. I try some other characters, rather randomly, but they usually are lowercase (about 10). I try to get every stylistic element in the draft, like stems, bowls, slants, etc., but I&rsquo;m not too consequent. This phase is for developing the idea, so there can be different styles yet. I do not draw a &ldquo;final&rdquo; draft on paper, but start doing this on the computer.
There, i start with the character i&rsquo;m in the mood for, but this often ends in the dilemma that I need another character first, because it influences the character I&rsquo;d like to start with. So this is a continuous change of &ldquo;i want to&rdquo; and &ldquo;i have to do first&rdquo;. Usually it ends up in doing &ldquo;n&rdquo;, &ldquo;o&rdquo;, &ldquo;H&rdquo;, &ldquo;A&rdquo; as leading characters, and there, it is pretty much where the &ldquo;final&rdquo; style is determined.
Then I do a-z and A-Z rather fast (2 days or so?), and then start the long long long balancing process. The problem then is, that I start to be keen on ligatures. I draw them too early and have to revise them about 100.000 times :)
If I&rsquo;ve had enough of the design part, I start creating diacritics or do some opentype-coding&hellip;</p>
<p>This are the observations of a typedesign beginner still learning (3 fonts so far, none finished completely), but I think this is much more effective than the method I started with (a-z, A-Z from scratch). The problem there is, that you have the atypical characters first (a, e, g), which are difficult to derive a common style from.</p>

It&rsquo;s finals week at school, so hopefully i&rsquo;ll get the chance to pick up a pencil ( I don&rsquo;t think a computer should EVER be the first step in the design process, unlike some of my classmates) and rough out a design. I&rsquo;ll be sure and let you guys have a time-lapse peek at my work as I complete it, and you&rsquo;ll hopefully have some equally good advice for me then. I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re all friendly, and not so egotistical (though you have every right to be) that you insult my questions or give sarcastic responses. Thank you.</div>

<p>It works fine. I know what the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; of the typeface are, so I can work through a to z applying the rules. Then, when I have the first draft of each letter, I can try out combinations and change/refine characters to make it work better.

<p>But the tool can hamper what you can do.
I was just doing a 60ies-hippie-floral-design for a poster this week (cliché-like weavy, colored forms flowing in each other, with some bloated letters hidden in them). I tried starting with illustrator, but had to give up because it just wasn&rsquo;t possible to get really flowing forms with that tool from scratch.
A quick and dirty pencil draft, a quick scan, and redrawing it on the computer did the job&hellip;
I think an artpad would have done it too. But the mouse did not.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mmmm? The pencil/pen, has nothing whatsoever to do with the recording of typefaces and usually gets in the way. Though you may find mental&hellip;play space in scratching around with old tools, it is only that, mental and play. when you&rsquo;re done you still need to execute a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; line which a pencil cannot do, and fails to represent in even the best sketch. Until the digital line is cut, and thus the letter recorded, nothing else counts, or matters since none of it is left when the dust clears from the digital font.</p>
<p>As for order of design, the press likes pat answers, but anyone whose done more than 1,000 or so, should tell you that &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; e.g. if it is the first letter of a new family, you <em>can</em> &ldquo;start&rdquo; anywhere. But it is not until you draw the &ldquo;controls&rdquo; (noted elsewhere I&rsquo;m sure), that you &ldquo;know&rdquo; the appearance of the repeating things and so you can finish by designing the unique things, and not &ldquo;chase your tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it is not the first letter of a new family, there is an algorithm where the selection of character to draw is based on intended use that leads you from the existing styles to the right choice, which always follows after the control characters. E.g., if an agate is to be drawn well, based on the text face, then you must draw the controls from the text first, and then head for the most &ldquo;congested&rdquo; characters, like e.g., e or g, and then, loop back to the controls if you need to, early in the process, to make sure the controls and special-est characters, whatever they may be, work.</p>

<p>I grew up making marks on paper, so that method is very natural to me for getting ideas out of my head, and that&rsquo;s its strength. The Bézier curve is very precise and endlessly malleable, and that&rsquo;s its strength. The one thing I don&rsquo;t do anymore is to make precise drawings on paper.

<p>I find it helps avoid prejudice, because there is not much rhyme or reason to it, in terms of character shape. Some though &ndash; i and j, m and n, and v and w, are beside each other, probably because of letters that were spun off others were placed next to their source letter.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s the point of alphabetic order &ndash; it&rsquo;s a special sequence of letters that doesn&rsquo;t contain any words longer than 3 letters (OK Scrabblers, prove me wrong!)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bezier curves do impart a natural flavor to curves. If you&rsquo;re not careful stuff can start to look all the same. That being said, most people that say that you must start with a pencil suck at bezier curves. Since I can get my ideas out more quickly and clearly with beziers, that&rsquo;s where I often start. So my advice is this: if you are going to do type design, figure out how to use bezier curves.</p>
<p>As for which letter order you should use: it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I think it&rsquo;s a type design myth that doing the o and n first gives you a better sense of what the other characters are going to look like. In some ways, those characters are the most vanilla, and give you less of an idea than some of the more challenging characters.</p>
<p>If you are simply manufacturing a font, then it makes sense to start with o and h or even O or H, where elements can be easily reused. If you are designing a font, you might start anywhere your idea is most relevant.</p>

<p>Amen! Digital type is a medium. Without mastering the tools and building blocks of a medium, one will never get anywhere with it.</p>
<p>Calligraphy and Lettering are different mediums. Sometime two or three of the mediums come together, and knowledge in one are can help in another, but this isn&rsquo;t a de facto transfer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sometimes alphabetic order can lead you down a primrose path from which there is no escape.  Several months back, I ran across an enchanting little typeface in a book of handlettering with very unusual serifs. They resembled a dancer&rsquo;s foot <em>en pointe</em>, and so I thought the name <em>Twinkletoes</em> would suit the typeface well.</p>
<p>Since I was presented with a complete upper and lowercase alphabet A-z, I dutifully recreated them, and then fleshed out a complete character set. It was only <em>after</em> I imported all of my outlines into Fontographer, generated a PS font and opened it in FontLab (have I mentioned before that I think FogLamp is a rip?), and started the process of setting widths, sidebearings and kerning, did I discover a VERY serious problem. The alphabet fit together beautifully A-Z and a-z, but virtually EVERY other letter combination required kerning. Before I got too far into it, I estimated that, at my present clip, expanding the basic kerning to include accented characters would result in over 10,000 kerning pairs&ndash;not a practical solution. So, I shelved the project; maybe someday, when everything in my life is settled and I <em>need</em> some aggravation, I&rsquo;ll go back to this project.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: sometimes it works, sometimes it don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Often I start with something like habrgefits (a stripped-down &ldquo;[[hamburgefontstiv]]&quot;) and HAOP, and play around with those. But sometimes I&rsquo;ll just do a handful and then fill in the rest in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>I tend not to do a lot on paper, but I do spend a while refining the concepts in my head. Sometimes I can noodle on letterforms for days before I try anything. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll jot stuff down, but often it&rsquo;s only a few key elements to remind me of the serif structure, or relative proportions, or the like - not necessarily very many whole letters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that there is a correlation (not a rule, just a correlation) between the age of the type designer and whether they draw on paper first. Seems like the 50+ crowd tend to be overwhelmingly paper-firsters, and the under 40 crowd have a lot more folks who go straight to the computer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find that which letters I start with depends on the individual typeface, but in general terms I try to mix in both forms that establish proportion (h i n o) and what are usually &lsquo;characteristic&rsquo; forms, i.e. letters that do more to establish the flavour or personality of the face, (a b e g). The lowercase a is often the first thing I sketch, since this letter more than any other establishes the personality of the face, but I don&rsquo;t finalise this letter until I have done things like h and o.</p>
<p>If I am working on a multiscript typeface, I&rsquo;ll work on the different writing systems concurrently. So alongside my initial Latin letters I&rsquo;ll be making initial Cyrillic or Greek etc.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s where it can get pretty complicated,
and even more so important, to proceed carefully.</p>
<p>In addition to the effect of one&rsquo;s choices on the display/textiness of
the end result, there&rsquo;s the additional and equally (sometimes more so)
important factor of skewing one script or the other (or the third, etc.!)
in a certain inauthentic direction. Pure, grade-A quicksand.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think how the identity of a face is defined depends on how the initial idea came.
For this reason, the starting point to me has been often a different letter (or numeral), or a small group of them. When I started to learn software I played with geometric faces directly in FontStudio.
Later on, all my few finished or released types have seen the first ideas generated in the form of pencil sketches.</p>
<p>I think the best advice emerged from different perspectives. John Hudson with his huge experience is right, since you have to define or fix reference glyphs as the design proceeds, otherwise you&rsquo;ll lose focus (your problem). The key ones people underlined are the one to do, but it depends on the idea as well.</p>
<p>What Nick Curtis said about not having a strong or clear idea at the beginning seems not to make much sense. As Hrant pointed out, a design evolves as you start considering its problems, and it may turn out to be good, or to be just a better basis for something else.
But I think you&rsquo;ll start seeing this in perspective.</p>
