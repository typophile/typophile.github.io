  body: First I tried looking at chanceries, but they yielded nothing. I was hoping
    PsyOps would show something, but I didn&#39;t find anything there either. I&#39;m
    kind of stumped. Maybe we&#39;ll receive a good hint.

  body: Fabio, how about a little hint? For example, can the font be found on MyFonts?
    That at least narrows the field a little.

  body: <i>Humana?</i> <BR>I don&#39;t think so. The terminal doesn&#39;t curl in
    enough and the transition doesn&#39;t have enough contrast. <BR> <BR><i>MiramarItalic</i>
    <BR>The terminal here curls too much. Plus the connection to the diagonal stem
    is a straight one in the quiz sample, not notched like Miramar. <BR> <BR>
