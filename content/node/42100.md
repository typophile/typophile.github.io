  for logotypes (especially for web apps and internet companies). It has to look trendy
  and have some characteristic letter design. Here is an exaple of my favourite font
  <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?9SM\">Corisande</a>. I'm looking for something
  similar. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your sugestions!\r\n\r\nMadeo"

    to Corisande. What I dont like about Dax is the difference between thin and thick
    strokes..."

    it. Does anyone else have some suggestions? I'm not only looking for alternatives
    to Corisande, it can be something completely different. :)\r\n\r\nM."

  body: "There was just a similar sort of question about finding an equivalent serif
    font to a too familiar design (Times NR). I could give you the equivalent suggestion
    for Sans fonts -- use the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html|Sans
    Serif Font ID Guide]] and pick some of the Key letters from Corisande and look
    up the (possibly) similar sans font families with similar structural/stylistic
    \ attributes. The Guide catalogs over 900 sans families.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
