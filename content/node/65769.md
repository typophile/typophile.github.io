body: Is there a font that exist like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-zaner/pro-one/">Zaner</a>,
  but without the thick strokes? Basically a font that looks like if you used a ballpoint
  pen to write a formal spencerian script. Any out there?

    Allyson]]. Not exactly monoline, but the strokes are very fine.
