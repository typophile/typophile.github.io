body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've had the Type ID subforum bookmarked for a while, but
  the time never came that I needed it... until now. I'm trying to figure out what
  font this is:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GRNw9.jpg\">\r\n\r\nMy best guess
  was Franklin Gothic, but I can't seem to replicate the \"M R S U\" with ITC Franklin
  Gothic. It's almost like it's between Book and Medium, and compressed horizontally
  a bit. Maybe it's a different version of Franklin Gothic, or not Franklin Gothic
  at all?\r\n\r\nI haven't been trying too hard to replicate the \"Gates/Puertas\"
  part because the distortion from the camera makes it difficult to make good comparisons.
  The R and S of \"M R S U\" are at least marginally straighter. They may even be
  two different typefaces...\r\n\r\nThanks!"
