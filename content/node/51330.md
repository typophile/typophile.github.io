body: "This is an awkward request but maybe someone here will know what I'm talking
  about.\r\n\r\nYears ago I was dumpster diving outside of a thrift store in my hometown
  of Fargo, ND when I came across a weird word processor looking thing. Instead of
  a traditional daisy wheel or other method of printing letters to the paper it used
  an actual ink pen tip that was attached to some sort of horizontal ribbon system
  - and it DREW CURSIVE!  Not just any cursive either - gorgeous very mechanical looking
  cursive.  Both the paper and the ribbon pen thing would move to accomplish this.
  \ The closest example I can find to what I remember the cursive looking like is
  this image from some of Bjork's album artwork - possibly designed by Me Company.\r\n\r\nhttp://secure.giantrobot.com/graphics/2004/03/16/bjorkduck.gif\r\n\r\nDoes
  any of this sound/look familiar to anyone?  I can't find this thing anymore - my
  parents may have thrown it out and my searches for info online have been entirely
  fruitless.\r\n\r\nJeff"
