  body: <i>&#62; Device Regulator</i> <BR>Nope, the most obvious is the different
    &#39;G&#39;, sample  <BR>is wider too. I was also veering &#40;pardon the pun&#41;
    to  <BR>a Rian Hughes design i must admit. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; Neutraface Demi Smallcaps
    Alternate</i> <BR>Nope, &#39;M&#39; is different, narrower, and look at that &#39;K&#39;.

    behind this one.

    &#39;S&#39; is just two circle arcs connected by a  <BR>straight line. This &#39;S&#39;
    is very well designed.'

  body: Hot damn, you were <i>RIGHT</i>, Stephen. It&#39;s customized  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/insignia/"
    target="_blank"> Insignia</a>. All the little sticking-out bits have been  <BR>chopped
    off. So Neville <i>CAN</i> draw a decent &#39;S&#39; after all <BR>&#40;well,
    most probably someone at Linotype digitized that  <BR>one, but still...&#41;.

  body: Well, I&#39;ll be! That it is. Just when I was starting to doubt <BR>myself.
    I guess I let the ol&#39; instincts take over on that one. <BR> <BR>They sure
    made a pretty thing out of Insignia. Wonder  <BR>where the sample is from.

  body: It&#39;s weird how this defining charasteristic has you  <BR>ruling out the
    possibility if it&#39;s missing. I didn&#39;t  <BR>even check Insignia at first,
    convinced as I was that  <BR>it couldn&#39;t be it. <BR> <BR>Well done, partner!
    No too bad a team, if I might  <BR>say so myself. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
