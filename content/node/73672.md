  body: "They did not use 'fonts' for currency. All the lettering on money is done
    my artists with engraving tools, at least when that bill was produced. I guess
    new currency design may be computer-aided, but they would not use commercial fonts
    to reduce the chance of forgery.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
