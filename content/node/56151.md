body: "I'm developing an article template for companion articles for my blog.  The
  blog will include a larger article about once per month.  The blog is a companion
  to a book I'm hopefully release this year.  I'm trying for a simple and clean look.
  \ It needs to be professional and appeal to my target audience of engineers.  The
  current design is inspired by the article format of the Harvard Business Review.
  \ \r\n\r\nAny overall feedback would be appreciated.  I'm also wondering if it is
  too plain or if I need to add a logo somewhere.  The other open question is do I
  need a running head or foot for an article this short?  Should I at least include
  page numbers?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for the help.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nZack\r\n\r\nUpdate:
  \ The previous attachment got lost in the Typophile server change.  The new attachment
  is working."

  body: "Just to clarify, this is how you want the articles to be displayed online,
    or the reader clicks a link and opens a PDF?\r\n\r\nOne thing I would suggest
    is making more contrast between your headers and the body copy on pages 2 and
    3. If you look at where you have a longer subhead, to me it blends in with the
    body copy. \"About the Author\" is pretty good, but I'd make even more contrast.
    A little bigger, maybe all caps or space beneath the subhead. Just play with it
    a bit."

    HTML.  I'll play with the level 2 subhead.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZack"

  body: "My main response, which others will probably say also, is that it would help
    to see the content of the articles before deciding on a suitable design. You can
    point out some things with Lorem Ipsum text but the majority of the design decisions
    have to be made in the context of the real text being set.\r\n\r\nApart from that,
    my 2 cents is:\r\n\r\nBoth the headings would stand out better if you put in a
    blank line before the paragraph. Since you are using blank lines between paragraphs,
    it looks especially unbalanced having the headers glued to the top of them.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of it seems to work pretty well. It's certainly a clean look, but if you
    want it to be distinctive you might want to add more stylistic features.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think the pull quote works going across two columns like that and the brown
    is too dark to be a contrast to the black. I'd either stick with black or use
    a lighter brown or a grey. Also, some structure around the pull quote might help
    it. The way I usually do them is across a single column with a 5pt stroke top
    and bottom with the text centred and italicised.\r\n\r\nPage numbers would probably
    be a good idea."
