  standards fonts are not enough .\r\nArabic web fonts simply doesn't exist as far
  as I know . that is because of the right to left complexity and for the multiple
  states for Arabic letter ( the letter in start of word different than it is in the
  middle or the last of  the word).\r\nIs there an solution to use Arabic fonts. I
  have suggest an idea to Google font directory to add support for Arabic fonts please
  take a seconds to <a href=\"http://goo.gl/mod/A3vn\">support this idea</a>.. \r\n"

  body: Arabic web fonts should work exactly the same as locally installed Arabic
    fonts specified in web pages. Text directionality and complex layout will depend
    on system or browser level support for these features, as implemented in the fonts,
    in the recipient's computer.

  body: "As far as I know, it's just a matter of licensing. Yes, they are harder to
    design, but there isn't any technical barrier. (To be fair, we haven't tested
    any Arabic fonts in our WebINK font service, yet, but there's no obvious reason
    they shouldn't work.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestion, Nabil. In fact, we have a few Arabic fonts in
    the pipeline, in fact. And, for designers here who have Arabic fonts, please get
    in touch, we're looking for more!\r\n\r\nI haven't started extensive testing in
    browsers yet, but as far as I know what John and Thomas say is right - if native
    fonts work, so should web fonts. I wouldn't be surprised if there were some corner
    cases that don't work properly, though. With Indic and Southeast Asian fonts,
    we're finding that (surprisingly to me) Mac doesn't support OpenType very well,
    so to work really well fonts need both OpenType and AAT tables.\r\n\r\nWe'll also
    soon be looking for beta testers to try Arabic web fonts on their pages, so, if
    you've got interest and technical skill to evaluate them properly, again, get
    in touch."

  body: There are few webfont implementations that don't support complex layout features.
    AFAIK, Opera for Linux and WebKitGtk only support simple scripts in their webfont
    implementations.
