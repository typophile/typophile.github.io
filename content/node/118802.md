body: I think it looks really really cool, and interesting. I was wondering if any
  one knew anything about this font. Or if anyone has the whole alphabet? Or at least
  something similar. The scan is from Schelter & Giesecke type specimen. Thanks

    but the emaciated Eckmann feeling is spot on. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CharlestonInUse_6121.jpg]\r\n
    The _s_, _a_, _e_ and _Z_ in particular look appropriate. Making a near monoline
    with Charleston's proportions and adding slab serifs would be an interesting exercise.\r\nDon"

    a variant. It took me a while to figure out it wasn't a "G".

    was much more plausible.

  body: "I didn't see that L as a G - but that was likely due to the context of the
    word it starts. Makes me wonder what the 'G' looks like.\r\n\r\nI have to say
    that, while I am a <em>huge</em> lover of art nouveau type, I don't care for this
    one. To me, those square serifs on the bottom right make it look like some modern
    day neophyte's attempt to create a period-looking font. And it's not even done
    consistently. Note that the square block exists on the 'a' but not the 'd'.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the faux Hebrew angle makes more sense of this? Nice observation, Johann."

  body: The squarish, reverse contrast feel of the original sample, and the little
    flag serifs, makes me think it may be subtly alluding to Hebrew writing.

  body: This typeface also reminded me of another Schelter & Giesecke Jugendstil typeface,
    <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/edelgotisch/' target='_blank'>Edelgotisch</a>
    (similar to the better known Eckmann Schrift). Luc Devroye attributes Edelgotisch
    to Albert Knab, 1901. He might be a leading contender for designer of the mystery
    typeface.

    pages according to the Flickr poster. What a wonderful assortment of type designs!
    That was definitely a golden age for font creativity.\r\nIt seems Schelter & Giesecke
    \ had a high opinion of this font, because they chose it as the font to make the
    section title for Roman titling  and ornamented lettering.\r\nThe specimen book
    might be available in a university library but is probably not available for inter-library
    loan. It might be possible to obtain a photocopy copy of the page with this typeface.\r\nWorldCat

    Your specimen follows section F. So, rather than try and find a matching page,
    you could ask for photocopies of the pages in section G. If you can get through
    the bureaucracy, the price will be nominal. Good luck. If you are successful it
