<p>Thanks to the great support in the Type ID board, I could find out the font is RNS Camelia, so I could come up with this:</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know, do you think the font is too thin?
It looks good it in the subtitle, though.</p>
<p>I gave it a second shot using Segoe UI:</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look as professional by far&hellip;
I&rsquo;m also unsure whether to use the Gaussian blur or not.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could recommend a different font?
I&rsquo;m open to all kinds of suggestion (and I don&rsquo;t have any experience with design at all).
It doesn&rsquo;t have to use the red-and-white contrast either, I just liked the idea.</p>
<p>The logo is intended for my hypnosis/coaching company, it should convey a kind of wellness and luxury, like you would expect from an expensive spa hotel.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Especially when you&rsquo;re simply taking the exact idea AND font AND image and just changing the letters. I mean, you even use the same single letter color difference as the already made banner. This isn&rsquo;t design, it&rsquo;s just copying EXACTLY something you like the look of.</p>

I mean, look at the iStockPhoto banner, it looks like it&rsquo;s taken from a glossy magazine, I like that a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware that it&rsquo;s not identity design - and it&rsquo;s not meant to be.
At this point I&rsquo;m just starting off with this, from a marketing perspective I&rsquo;m probably not specialized enough.
I want to get some more experience and then decide what I want to focus on (e. g., helping people quit smoking or lose weight). Depending on that, I&rsquo;d invest money in a good CI.</p>
<p>So right now, I just want to get a somewhat good design for my extremely low budget.
And any help and suggestions are highly appreciated. :-)</p>
<p>Yes, of course it&rsquo;s copying - so what?
I don&rsquo;t think there should be copyright issues (they use different styles for their banners every time), and I&rsquo;d purchase the image.
And as I said, I&rsquo;ll have a real CI designed once I know exactly what I want to specialize on and have a larger budget.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A sinking boat metaphor, you&rsquo;re really cheering me up. ;-P</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to brand myself actually, I&rsquo;m merely looking for a nice-looking header to start with.
I&rsquo;m a science of computer science and I want to finish my grade.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, I&rsquo;ve taken private classes in hypnosis - which is what I want to do for a living and to finance my studies.
Given everything I&rsquo;ve read on marketing, one should always specialize so that you have a clear target group.</p>
<p>Since I currently don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d like to specialize in (that comes with more experience), I think it&rsquo;s not really useful to think about branding at this point.
My CI would probably look different if I were targeting people who want to quit smoking than if I wanted to help people with improving their self-confidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily trying to reproduce something existing - you see, I&rsquo;m just not a designer, and I lack the budget to pay someone serveral hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a logo that is likely to change in a couple of months.
See my dilemma?
What would you do, given that situation?</p>
<p>I also understand your criticism: If this were a programming board, I&rsquo;d also recommend someone to either learn how to program properly or find a professional to do the work for him because that would be the only way to get decent results.
But, given the small budget and the fact that this is just an interim solution, I&rsquo;d really appreciate it if you could put the higher standards aside for a moment. :-)</p>

<p>not a single suggestion concerning the logo itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realize you&rsquo;re just looking for a quickie solution, but you&rsquo;re going about this the wrong way.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t design a logo with a big promotional photo behind it. You first design a logo by itself; one that will work well on your letterhead, business card, etc, and that will work in black-and-white as well as color, and one that will work well in tiny sizes, and most importantly which does a good job of representing your business.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve designed the logo, then you can start thinking about applying it to web banners.</p>
<p>So put the photo aside and give your logo some careful thought and post some logo ideas by themselves, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get some advice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think people are genuinely trying to help you with good branding.  Here are some perhaps provocative questions for you.  No need to answer them here, but you will probably have to answer them as you develop your business:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to invest too much energy into this&rdquo;
Why not invest some time and money into something as essential to the success of your business as branding?</p>
<p>&ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be used anywhere other than the website header&rdquo;
Why even have a website when it doesn&rsquo;t relate to any other part of your business brand?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really appreciate it if you could put the higher standards aside for a moment&rdquo;
Why would you approach your business this way, do you want to communicate that sentiment to your customers?</p>
<p>Waiting until you make enough to invest in a good identity and branding solution is like a computer programmer waiting to get a computer until they are a successful programmer.  In other words, you will likely never get there until you invest in consistent and effective communication with your potential customers.  That could be a logo, or it could be word of mouth, but you need to focus on the plan for communicating the value and benefits of your business to your customers.  Copying graphics is a waste of time that you could be spending working out the foundation of the business you are trying to create.  I do hope your business is a big success, and wish you all the best as you move forward with this challenging task.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">my suggestion is to boldface it so it pops more. Make the A a different color and put the M back to white, to help distinguish it, i actually like the idea of making the rounded letters stick out by changing colors. it shows a sign of uniqueness to me. experiment with different backgrounds. maybe a background aimed at what you want your website to be about?</div>
