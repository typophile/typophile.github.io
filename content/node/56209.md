    Where\u2019s the uppercase eszett in this picture?\r\n\r\na) First line, third
    character\r\nb) Second line, third character\r\nc) After having seen the new glyphs
    of Verdana and Tahoma, I wonder how an uppercase eszett would look like in ITC
    Bauhaus.\r\n"

    letters. That's an eszett in the second line, and a B in the first line."

    my disppointment about the form the new glyph got in Microsoft\u2019s sans-serif
    faces, which too closely resembles a \u2018B\u2019. And my general skepticism
    about the capital sharp S, I guess.\r\nITC Bauhaus doesn\u2019t have an uppercase
    eszett."

    post. Happy to pass feedback to the designers - in the case of Arial that would
    be Monotype and as I recall Ascender did the other sans. \r\n\r\nProbably too
    late to change them for Windows 7, but they can always be updated in the future.
    \r\n\r\nAlso most of the sans faces are user interface fonts, that would only
    get rendered at small sizes in UI. That may be a reason for the design, but could
    also be a reason to have them stand out more. \r\n\r\nAnyway if you have any more
    detailed feedback please send it directly to me.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
