  where I can get alternate characters for Lubalin Graph ? Have they been digitised
  at all ? I've only found std versions without alternate characters. I can always
  draw them by hand, but a digitized version like the Avant Garde alternates would
  be a huge time saver...\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!"

  body: I'm not asking to get it for free, I just haven't found any alternate characters
    in the versions sold by Linotype, Adobe and Font Shop (which all sell the ITC
    version, anyways). Are there any other versions out there ? Is there a Pro version
    like for Avant Garde ?
