  body: They may have applied art to create their unique nameplate. The nit-picker
    in me compels me to point out that a masthead may contain a publications'  business
    information; editorial and management staff, circulation, etc. Publications' titles
    are called nameplates.

  body: "I'm not familiar with the terminology (masthead, nameplate, etc) and I'm
    a bit confused, but if we are talking about the title \"APPLIED ARTS\" the /R
    terminal looks exactly like a <strong>[[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout
    HTF26-Junior Flyweight]]</strong>.\r\nNo?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/applied_arts_6426.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks. I always get the title terminology wrong. This particular issue was
    part of a guest redesign by Rethink of Vancouver, so I think it isn't customized.
    Applied Arts' regular nameplate is unique though.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell in
    the image above, but the terminal actually ends in a straight vertical line. I'll
    take a photo of the cover tonight and upload it."

  body: "Fivos is absolutely correct. Knockout HTF26-Junior Flyweight  has that unique
    R, with the straight vertical stoke ending, as do HTF 28 JuniorFeatherweight and
    others.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "Thanks Herb. The R only has that feature in the thinnest of the weights.
    It's a shame that H&FJ doesn't have any PDF specimens on their website to check
    details like these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
