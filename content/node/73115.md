  and design from the English fabric trade and thought I should create a blog which
  gives a taste of the collection.\r\nIt is not complete or well done (I only started
  building it Monday) but please take a look at it here.\r\n\r\nwww.textiletrademarks.com\r\n\r\n\r\nBest
  regards and maybe see you at TypeCon\r\n\r\nAdrian Wilson"
