    Reiter (the blue rider)\r\n\r\nTo see samples of \"fonts\" (or lettering) look
    for the woodcuts by Erich Heckel; and also see the work by  George Grosz, K\xE4the
    Kollwitz ( i just love her work!!!).\r\n\r\nFonts? maybe look for the advertisement
    designed by John Heartfield; around that time you'll find more about the Bauhaus."

  body: While you're Googling, try "Lang+Metropolis" and "Caligari" using Images search.
    A few years back, the former combo led me to a poster which provided the inspiration
    for a freeware font, which I cleverly called <em>Metropolis</em>. If you're interested,
    you can find it <a href="http://www.fontfreak.com/authors/nick_curtis.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
