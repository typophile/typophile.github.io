  sans serif (/serif) ... proportionally looks a lot like Futura. Used here as Display.\r\nAgain,
  proportionally similar to Futura yet with sharp tapered endpoints.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  on typeface name, house, designer?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks."

    uploading a tighter crop. Check out the serifs on the \"E\" and \"T\"\r\n\r\nWhat
    ya think?\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_6099.jpg]"

    wondering if the other stuff isn't Futura of some kind."

  body: 'Oh. Err. That is kinda sad. That really is just Futura with little serifs
    attached. It isn''t Penumbra at all. I can tell because of the traps in the shapes. '
