  touchscreen interface and we are founding a problem displaying the client font at
  small sizes (some letters are bolder than other)... it seems like a resolution problem,
  but standard fonts like arial are displayed correctly... any idea where to search
  for optimized fonts for screendesign or what to do to display them correctly?\r\n\r\nmany
  thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nnando."

    font system</a>, available from Typotheque. It was developed specially for low-resolution
    screens and interactive displays. There\u2019s also an <a href='http://www.typotheque.com/blog/elementar_app'>iPad
    app</a> which lets you control the font variations with touch gestures."

    What's the OS?\r\n"

  body: "thank you for yr link gferreira. a very very nice tool to look for a font!
    elementar is a nice readable. our client have already a pixelfont for the very
    small fonts, but we wanted to change it to the corporate font... \r\n\r\nafter
    a few tests today we realize that the font is even not displaying correct until
    16pt... that's really bad. \r\n\r\nos is windows 7, touchscreen amx. it seems
    like the hinting is not working fine with the rendering of the amx software...
    when i use the font in other programms on windows we don't have any display problem...
    standard windows fonts like arial are working fine...\r\n\r\nfrode, you got mail!\r\n\r\n"
