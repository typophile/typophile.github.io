  body: "Seems like a slightly rounded version of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/aurora/\">Aurora</a>.
    Perhaps a face that was available in the pre-digital era? What is the date of
    this sample? Aurora goes back to the late 1920's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    film, which was released in 1960. maybe i'll email criterion. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/268-breathless\r\n\r\nAurora
    does look similar."
