body: Is there a typeface with a nice rf ligature? I actually can't recall ever seeing
  rf paired together.

      Morfeo.

  body: A connected /rf/ would be better, imo. At least makes for better spacing.

  body: "I once gave a talk in Thessaloniki about the hidden benefits of ligation,
    including aiding readability. At least one person though thinks that talk was
    crap. :-)  But he's (still) a friend.\r\n\r\nI haven't thought it all through,
    but I think the best basis would be to go through the lexicon of a given language
    and for word pairs (or more generally, sets) that have convergent boumas use ligation
    to diverge them. But it has to be consistent.\r\n\r\nFor example in English, for
    \"guest\" and \"quest\" the latter might get an \"st\" ligature but the former
    not.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    idea. Wouldn't that be distracting in some cases, at least at first. While that
    would change the word shape for \"quest\" in this case, perhaps for better recognition,
    but it would only really work if everyone made the same choice. What if one designer
    thought the former should it? I'm not arguing that it wouldn't improve things,
    but it would only to well if it were adopted by many people."
