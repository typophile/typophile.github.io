body: All I know for sure is, that it is a free font. I have tried all the machines
  that identify fonts online, but it doesn't give the right result. I don't know the
  terms to describe how it looks, so see the picture. I would really appreciate any
  help I can get, as I want to use it for a wedding invitation my self.
