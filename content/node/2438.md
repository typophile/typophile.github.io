body: Hi Typophiles. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious about the math symbols found in most
  fonts &#40;pi, integral, delta, mu, square root etc&#41;. As I&#39;ve taken a survey
  of fonts, some appear to have drawn font specific math symbols, but many seem to
  have <i>standard</i> math symbols. Is there a standard set? If so, should I use
  them? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy

  body: Randy -- <BR> <BR>If you generate fonts using Adobe Standard Encoding, there
    are about two dozen miscellaneous &#34;math&#34; characters which will be called
    from the Symbol font, regardless of whether you draw them or not -- i.e., what
    you draw in those positions will be ignored. <BR> <BR>These are the so-called
    &#34;standard&#34; math symbols you refer to. Your choice whether to use them
    or not will probably hinge on how important it is to have symbols that blend stylistically
    with your typeface design &#40;and how much time you want to spend on them&#41;.

  body: Thanks Kent. Did you draw them for Whitman? :-&#41; <BR>I ask because I&#39;m
    not sure how important it is that they blend in a font for long text. &#40;I&#39;m
    finishing up Saint Nicolaus which I posted in the critique section.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy

  body: 'Randy -- <BR> <BR>I drew all of the glyphs in Whitman from scratch. But the
    Font Bureau&#39;s standard character set does not call for all of those math characters;
    so I didn&#39;t draw an integral, for example. They use some of those character
    slots for other glyphs -- for instance, the ff-ligatures are included standard
    in FB fonts in the infinity &#40;ffi&#41;, plusminus &#40;ffl&#41;, and notequal
    &#40;ff&#41; positions. <BR> <BR>In addition, I used some of the other positions
    for other glyphs, not necessarily part of FB&#39;s set, like raised parentheses.
    <BR> <BR>Another example: I included the multiplication sign in the approxequal
    slot so that it would be accessible from the Mac keyboard &#40;which it is ordinarily
    not&#41;. I got this idea from Matthew Carter, who did the same for Miller. It&#39;s
    useful for expressions like 2x4 or for botanical hybrid names like <i>Crinum x
    powellii</i>.  <BR> <BR>I discuss these unusual features in the  <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanSpecimen.pdf"
    target="_blank">PDF specimen</a> available from my site. The complete character
    sets can be seen on <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmanCharSet1.html" target="_blank">
    this html page</a>. <BR> <BR>These sorts of unorthodox arrangements are frowned
    upon by purists and will be made obsolete and unnecessary as Unicode and OT become
    more the standard. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: 'Randy, Adobe Standard Encoding is for Type 1 PS fonts, and I don&#39;t recommend
    making Type 1 fonts at all. This is a dying technology. Either make CFF OpenType
    fonts if you want PS format outlines and hints, or make TrueType fonts. Type 1
    fonts rely on external character mapping between 8-bit cells and Unicode codepoints,
    which is a very limited technology &#40;and the principle reason that Adobe got
    involved OpenType: Type 1 was a dead end&#41;. TT and OT fonts contain a cmap
    table that map from glyphs to Unicode characters internally, which is much more
    reliable. <BR> <BR>Hrant, digital documents have a much longer lifespan than the
    software and fonts that you use to create them. If you encode a document to display,
    for example, ffi ligatures by using the increment math symbol character, you&#39;ve
    created a document that can only be read in that font or the small number of fonts
    from Foundry A with the same hack. Meanwhile, Foundry B has put the ffi ligature
    in a different slot. Of course, your document cannot be spellchecked, cannot be
    searched, cannot be correctly sorted. And then the 8-bit font format you are using
    stops being supported by Microsoft &#40;and it will happen to Type 1&#41;. So
    what have you &#39;invented&#39;, except a mess with no long-term usability?'

    world, it is not. So, yes, I continue to destroy text to get ligatures. Guilty
    as charged. I agree with you completely -- in spirit, but not yet in practice.
    <BR> <BR>Regarding the Whitman fonts, it&#39;s up to FB to specify the formats
    they wish to offer and support. Within that constraint, I do what I can with what
    I have to work with. <BR> <BR>Randy, I believe that Eduardo is right. You must
    use the OT <i>liga</i> feature to specify the ligature substitution. &#40;John
    will correct me if I&#39;m wrong.&#41; It is an elegant solution, but it requires
    software that supports OT layout features in order to implement.  <BR> <BR>--

  body: <i>IIRC, the only f-ligatures &#39;unicoded&#39; are fi and fl.</i> <BR> <BR>There
    are a few more encoded, but don&#39;t use them. They are &#39;presentation form&#39;
    characters, only included in Unicode for bakcwards compatibility with existing
    8-bit character sets. The whole point of the Unicode character/glyph distinction
    is that you do not need to encode every visual element, only the underlying text.
    The word &#39;office&#39; is encoded as the characters o f f i c and e, regardless
    of whether the sequence ffi is <i>displayed</i> as a ligature or not. There is
    no need to encode ligatures. See the introductory part of my article on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/opentype/default.htm">Windows
    Glyph Processing</a>. This has been the major development of all new text processing
    and font technology for almost ten years now.
