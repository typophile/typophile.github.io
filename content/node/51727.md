body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nHere is the business card I designed for the man that sold
  me the toner for my Samsung laser. This was done over two nights. It\u2019s set
  entirely in Ascenders underrated Miramonte.\r\n\r\nPlease critique it. I want it
  to feel clean, precise, and approachable. \r\n\r\nThe list needs reordering.\r\n\r\nHow
  about my comma and ampersand usage???\r\n\r\nHow is the grammar in this sentance:
  \u201CIf you don\u2019t see it listed here, call Bob. He probably has it in stock!\u201D???\r\n\r\nAnything
  missing?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/businesscard_3515.png]\r\n\r\nI
  really appreciate all you helps.\r\n\r\nThis is the first job I get from a total
  stranger. I don\u2019t want to mess this up.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "OK, here goes my cent.\r\nLaser+Toner+Inks on the horizontal blue bar; maybe
    you should consider adding more space to the right and left margins, cause when
    trimmed you maybe end up with with the edge very close to the text. If that is
    1/8 of inch, ad +1/16.\r\nFor the back, the list of items maybe would look better
    if in a medium face, beacuse of the knock out on the background.\r\nYour customer
    won't be disappointed if you leave it as is."

    right -- perhaps 1 pt smaller text? Same size as the small print at the top?\r\n\r\nBack:
    the thin white on the blue shade gives me a headache :-) Perhaps one weight up.\r\n\r\nDon't
    worry -- Overall, it's a nice and clean design, and tells you everything you want
    to know if you find it on your desk. Nothing wrong with comma's. And it's a nice
    logo -- yours as well?"

    two tones on the background. Good start though, and heading in the right direction.

    on the card.\r\n\r\nI did not design that graphic element. It came from a FontShop

    I\u2019m not really that familiar with what constitutes a logo when you use a

    that stuff works.\r\n"

    again!\r\n\r\nYou guys were right! I think it looks much better now. Miramonte
    does not have a medium weight (yet) so I used bold on the back list that me and
    my client need to emend. \r\n\r\nDoes using the bold on the back list mess up
    the hierarchy\u2014if I even have one?\r\n\r\nDo I need to kern the nameplate?
    Please don\u2019t say yes :-) \r\n\r\nI also changed the colors. More \u201Ccobalty\u201D
    and the ghost graphic on the back is less prominent.\r\n\r\nThe plus signs for
    \u201CLASER+TONER+INKS\u201D is now matching in weight. I shrunk down the nameplate
    after you guys told me about it being to close to the edge... I knew something
    was not quite right, so thanks for emphasizing that.\r\n\r\nI baseline shifted
    everything that possibly could need it.\r\n\r\nI also do feel the card has more
    air in it too. So I thank you all your suggestions.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "Don't you think the back text is too fat now? It could be just one pt smaller

    line up the logo with the right side of his name. That'd be a nice counterweight
    for the left aligned info on the right hand side. (I wondered about the font weight
    difference, left and right, but I think it's okay. You can also <em>over</em>balance
    stuff.)\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you definitely have to kern 'LA' -- it's too close compared
    to the rest of the line."

    I added 2 percent more space around the LA combination. I added one percent around
    the TO combination.\r\n\r\n* For the rear text list (which is subject to change)
    I when down one more point and it does look better still. \r\n\r\n* I also added
    3 percent more character space and the line spacing has increased too.\r\n\r\nI
    feel pretty good thus far.\r\n\r\nThe blue will be either 072 blue or 2736 blue...

  body: "SuperUltraFabulous, you should really agree a price with the client up-front.
    That way no-one gets any unpleasant surprises. Here in the UK, I might charge
    \xA330 an hour (call it $45/hour) and estimate, say, a couple of hours for the
    logo and card. Maybe another couple of hours for other stationery. \r\n\r\nBut
    you should always consider two things: what you feel is a reasonable hourly rate,
    and what the market will bear. Be prepared to negotiate."

    You can't choose fancy stocks or anything, but the quality and turn around is
    good and you can't beat the price. The last run I did was for a bakery - 1000
    cards, matte finish with a 2 day delivery and cost $90 Can. \r\n\r\nYour design
    is nice but there is a lot of repeating information. I would suggest trying to
    put all the product info on the blue side, and keep the white side for the blue
    strip logo(remove it from the blue side, you don't need it twice) and his contact
    info.\r\n\r\nCards are so tiny, there's no need to repeat the info :)\r\n\r\n*high

    towards the right. Suggust you move the two columns to the left so that the left
    margin is the same as the left margin on the front of the card.\r\n\r\nThe bullets
    look a little weak. How about using a plus sign instead of the dot? That would
    tie into the plus signs in the main display line.\r\n\r\nThe type for italic blurb
    on the back side is a little light given the arwork behind it. Hopefully the font
    you're using has a medium weight that falls between the light and bold weights
    you're using on the card now.\r\n\r\nUnlike the earlier post, I like the idea
    of repeating the contact info on the back. That way no matter which side of the
    card you pickup, you have the phone number available."

    YOU! I called those people and the price is very cheap. Did you opt for the matte
    finish? In all my Strathmore paper promotions the cards are coated with just an
    aqueous coating... wondering if the matte is more fabulous or something. Speaking
    of Stathmore\u20145000cards uses 16.4 paper\u2014I have no idea how heavy that
    is. Strathmore paper goes up 130 lbs which felt nice to me. Did your business

    didn\u2019t understand all the options so I called and they were helpful.\r\n\r\nHrant>>>
    You are right, I\u2019m in the process of designing 3 other different cards for
    the same client so he can have a few options. I love the little printer guy. He

    Unfortunately, Miramonte does not come with a medium weight {Steve Matteson if
    your listening...!}. http://www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/Miramonte.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
    is why I used the bold weight. You are certainly right the bullets look weak.
    However I\u2019m not too sure about the plus signs. Maybe a little too much. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture8_4601.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    left side has part plus signs and part bigger bullets... bigger bullets look better
    too. Umm... as for the alignment, I\u2019m not sure where to go.\r\n\r\nI also
    agree with you about having the contact info on both sides. I just think of all
    those business cards in a fish bowl at the counter of the chinese take-out. You
    know: \u201CPut your card in for chance to win a free kung-pao bowl for two\u2019.
    Most of what you see is blank white paper.\r\n\r\nBut I also agree with Haley
    that there is a lot redundancy on this card.\r\n\r\nThe back should be:\r\n\r\nLaser
    Toner & Inkjet Cartridges\r\nFax & Copier Supplies\r\nInkjet & Photo Paper\r\nPrinter
    Ribbons\r\nDigital Photo Service\r\nPrinter Service & Repair\r\nCopier & Printer
    Sales\r\n\r\nOf course, I have wait for confirmation if he\u2019ll go for that.
    \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll see. One down. Three to go.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    sides) \r\n\r\nThe paper weight is pretty generic. It's a good stock for business
    cards. Not too flimsy or anything. I've never had complaints from clients about
    it. Usually I don't even opt for a proof from them unless I'm using some super
