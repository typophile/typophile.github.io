    such as this.\r\n\r\nThe, a critic such as I can offer you feedback, as I look
    at your font. But a link that takes me somewhere, is difficult to give detailed

    Also recently, in the Hebrew discussion area there has been this: http://typophile.com/node/71773\r\n\r\nMost
    people here do not work on Hebrew type, so you will get limited comments.  "
