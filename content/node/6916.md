  body: Looks like a font, but the odds are it is of Japanese origin. The only place
    I know to see these fonts are in the <a href="http://www.p22.com/pavilion/index.html"
    target="_blank">Font Pavillion collections</a> at P22/IHOF. P22 says they have
    limited stocks of these and cannot get more from the Japanese vendors. Most have
    a Latin version as well as Japanese characters. <BR> <BR>If someone else knows
    good links in English for Japanese fonts &#40;with Latin characters&#41;, that
    could be a useful resource.

  body: Susy, If you are only going to make a couple of words, I would think you could
    draw them in Illustrator or another drawing program. The shapes aren&#39;t very
    complicated

  body: Thanks David, those are good links. Gray Graphics also has links to some other
    Japanese Foundries like Flop Design, although you need to click on the &#34;?&#34;
    link to find them.
