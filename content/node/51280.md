  are using a new typeface for the article headings, its a san-serif font with sharp
  edges. does anyone know what it is? and where I can find it? or a similar font.
  (i will try to find a bigger image)\r\nI found that Wonderland Magazine changed
  their typeface to something similar just a little bit stretched vertically. I am
  uploading an attachment of that one too... awesome. thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    too small to really see.\r\n\r\nThe serif in picture 40 is a Bodoni. The serif
    in picture 30 looks like some kind of customized hairline Bodoni."
