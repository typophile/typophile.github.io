  body: "I searched Abstractfonts, which has the largest collection of handwritten
    freebie fonts I know (around 1200), and I searched 'informal handwritten' at MyFonts.
    No luck at either place.\r\n\r\nAs I have said many times, hand-printed fonts
    are very easy and cheap to make, so if you search a few of the likely places without
    finding it, your best choice is to find something with a similar feel and use
    that.  Your font could be a custom one-off font, or even a 'personal font'. There
    are too many of these to spend much time searching, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n- Mike
