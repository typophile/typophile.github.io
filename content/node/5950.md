  body: 'Howdy Mr. Jefferson Lomax. <BR> <BR>Definitions and samples of kerning are
    written in many books, <BR>but since the physical square of the letter is disappeared,
    <BR>you have to be able to read the white and imagine it. <BR>Kerning is about
    painting somehow. <BR>A link for you: <a href="http://www.owlsoup.com/foamtrain/glossary/"

  body: Just one of my pet pieves, could you put the dot back on the lowercase i?
    It looks like a mistake. Also try making the mark in the middle smaller, it seems
    to be overwhelming the type.

  body: Alessandro, <BR>Thanks for the links and the help. It looks a lot better.
    You are entered into my &#34;People I Owe&#34; folder on my desktop. <BR> <BR>Daniel,
    <BR>The original dot on the i seemed to stand out too much and therefore was removed.
    I have made some adjustments that hopefully will feel more like the other letters
    and will post them here with the original. Let me know what you think. <BR> <BR>Top=
    original i, Bottom= new version  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/42440.jpg"

  body: 'Jefferson, <BR> <BR>I think the kerning  looks better and the words more
    even. <BR> <BR>For what it&#39;s worth: I really have to say that the i should
    keep its original round dot. The combination of letters &#39;ig&#39; make a nice
    vertical balance at that part of the word and the modified dot just makes the
    letter and word look somehow squashed or imparied. <BR> <BR>The a in Lomax looks
    a little small like the bottom of the bowl isn&#39;t descending below the baseline
    as it should and the  recessed crown on it make it look like it&#39;s timid. <BR>

  body: Howdy John, <BR> <BR>I have replaced the dot on the &#34;i&#34; but haven&#39;t
    changed the &#34;a&#34; though. It is the original &#34;a&#34; from Friz Quadrata
    and in Illustrator it bottoms out at the same level as the other round letters
    used here. I wonder if the shortness your seeing may be due to conversion to raster
    format. When I am more confident, I&#39;ll just design all the lettering instead
    of &#34;adjusting&#34; someone elses design.   ...gimme time. <BR> <BR>On a sidenote,
    I am designing my first font that I&#39;ll post in the critique section soon.
    I&#39;ve listened to this forum for a while now and am impressed by the professional
    critiques that are given.
