  body: "Don't know this type and really doubt it could have been one, meaning as
    it. This looks like a custom job based on some machanical/squared condensed sans
    (some finials and angles cut and /A crossbar reworked).\r\nSome fonts to base
    the customization on: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/banque-gothique-rr/|Banque
    (not Bank) Gothic Extra Condensed Extra Bold]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamante/|Diamante]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/octin-college/|Octin College]]\r\nAlternative
    for the laziest: [[http://www.dafont.com/anitlles.font|Anitlles]] (possibly an
    attempt to digitize a font based on the original main title)"
