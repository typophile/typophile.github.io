body: "I'm trying to identify the fonts used in a logo created in the early 80s..\r\n\r\nMy
  first thought, with the exception of the \"e\", is that the font looked like Caslon
  224. I have placed the font ITC Caslon 224 (in gray) below the type for the logo.
  Although Caslon 224 is close it does not match the serifs on the \"T\" arm nor does
  it match the counters of the \"P\" and \"R\" and the \"K\" is close except it seems
  condensed as compared to the original. The \"O\" is a very close match\r\n\r\nI
  think the \"e\" is ITC Tiffany but not sure and I have no idea what was used for
  the dash and the comma.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nBill "
