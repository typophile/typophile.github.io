  the logo \"OASIS\"\r\nhttps://www.behance.net/gallery/11135943/oasis\r\n\r\n- And
  the one on this image\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HugoMarie_5451.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks."

    to my mind but don't think that's the one... A bigger and/or not angled sample
    would surely help.\r\n'HUGO & MARIE': if I clearly remember, it's a custom logo
    work by [[http://www.mariohugo.com|Hugo Mario]] (half of 'Hugo & Marie'). Used
    to be showcased on his website."

    also good.

    the crossbar on the A), you have a pretty good match for \"OASIS.\"\r\n\r\nZapf

  body: Yes, but Optima has sharper stroke ends than the other two, which don't appear
    on the OASIS sample (from what I can see).
