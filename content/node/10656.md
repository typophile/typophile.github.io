    is based on Oz Cooper&#39;s lettering. <BR> <BR><a href="http://typographi.ca/cgi-bin/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=cooper"
    target="_blank">Here are links</a> to other Ozzie fonts. I doubt you have access
    <BR>to any of these, but maybe it&#39;s time to buy! I&#39;ll post later to  <BR>recommend
    some of the more economical picks.

  body: The below is said in all seriousness, but with my tongue planted firmly in
    my cheek. Meaning, I do believe in what I&#39;ve written, but sometimes the boss
    doesn&#39;t. <BR>-- <BR>If we are designers, and our job is to create identities
    for our clients that are to be unique and original, creating for them a strong
    presence in the marketplace in which they sell,which in turn will help them become
    profitable, doesn&#39;t it behoove us to have a greater variety of typefaces at
    our fingertips? <BR> <BR>Also, you can always build the price &#40;or part of
    it&#41; of the typeface into the cost of the work for which it was used.

    and anybody with the Publisher program will have it. I could email it to you.

    terms of the end-user license if you mailed the font to Kate.
