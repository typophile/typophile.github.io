  body: Cool! <BR>I prefer your Serif &#34;2&#34; version. <BR>Kobayashi&#39;s Calcite
    is an obvious reference here &#40;and I like it very much&#41;, but this one looks
    more flexible, versatile. <BR>Very nice.

  body: I&#39;ve always thought that Calcite nodded to some of Neville Brody&#39;s
    work, like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/industria/">Industria</a>
    for example. When looking at the examples of Chagrin, I can&#39;t help but be
    reminded of both Berhold&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/city/">City</a>
    and Zuzana&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/cholla/">Cholla</a>.
    These aren&#39;t bad things. In fact, I love this type of character squarishness.
    <BR> <BR>Chagrin has a friendlier feel to me, as compared to the others mentioned
    above. I&#39;d have to say that I actually prefer the first version of the serif.
    It&#39;s more distinctive from the other variation. Although the second one blends
    better with the sans and semiserif weights, maybe that&#39;s the point.

  body: 'First of all, I think Chagrin is superior to Calcite, and certainly to the
    other fonts mentioned. It&#39;s novel without feeling affected. <BR> <BR>Although
    I personally don&#39;t like very dark weights, it seems the Heavy embodies the
    most interesting essence. The other two weights don&#39;t seem genuine enough,
    especially not the Regular. <BR> <BR>Your serif tests at the bottom give me an
    idea: maybe this is a good design to implement the concept that different weight
    can sometimes have different structures. Specifically, I see the Heavy as being
    happiest in the &#34;Serif 2&#34; scheme &#40;the &#34;Serif 1&#34; has too many
    serifs&#41;, while the Regular might really get into its own as a sans. Which
    might mean the Bold should be a semi? <BR> <BR>Also, some of the structures aren&#39;t
    translating well from the Heavy down to the Regular. Like the upper arm of the
    &#34;a&#34; is wonderfully short in the Heavy, but too long in the Regular. And
    the &#34;e&#34; is superb in the Heavy, but gets too square as it gets lighter.
    <BR> <BR>So I suspect you&#39;re doing the &#34;weight loss&#34; too literally
    - I&#39;d give the lighter weights more roundness for example. <BR> <BR>BTW, that
    &#34;rationalist&#34; lc &#34;s&#34; &#40;the one where the stroke stress is vertical&#41;

  body: '<i>It seems the Heavy embodies the most interesting essence. The other two

    is definitely true. The heavy makes the most of the square/round contrast while
    the regular just seems square.  <BR>  <BR><i>So I suspect you&#39;re doing the
    &#34;weight loss&#34; too literally - I&#39;d give the lighter weights more roundness
    for example.</i> <BR>Agreed. More roundness in the regular would make it more
    texworthy also. The trick is keeping the flavor of the heavy, with a different
    structure! Back to the drawing board for that. <BR> <BR><i>Your serif tests at
    the bottom give me an idea: maybe this is a good design to implement the concept

    a thought I hadn&#39;t considered. Are there other fonts that do this successfully?
    My guess is that the serifs are going to be what keeps the the regular weight
    looking like it&#39;s part of the same family after I add more roundness. Anybody
    else have thoughts about this idea? <BR> <BR><i>Lastly: I&#39;m getting a tingle

    <BR> <BR>This close up shows what I did with the foot serifs. As you can see they
    are a natural extrapolation from the heavy weight. Seeing all the ducks in a row,
    do you still think they are too chunky? I slanted them both forward as a practical
    space issue in the black. No room for any other kind of treatment. I don&#39;t
    think it changes the original too much. It might even make it a little more &#42;icy&#42;.
    <BR> <BR>You can also see the interpolation changes the width of the bold and
    heavy weights but the regular remains at original width. <BR> <BR>Finally, the
    g: I&#39;m gonna reserve judgement on it until I&#39;ve drawn a regular g so I
    can see what it looks like across all weights. The problem I saw with the original
    g is that it looks less like a g and more like a c &#43; j &#40;essentially what
    it is&#41;. It was my least favorite of the old set so I was hankering for change.
    We&#39;ll see. <BR> <BR><i>Will any of your stuff be available in the near future?</i>
    <BR>I sure hope so. The only font that is anywhere close to ready is the jensonesque
    serif. That will hopefully be available in 2004. Can&#39;t say where yet. This
    has a long way to go, but I hope to finish it before spring. Given that this hobby
    has become a serious time gobbler, it&#39;d be nice to see a some coin from the
    efforts! <BR> <BR>Cheers. <BR>Randy'

  body: 'To my eye the middle weights have too heavy &#39;boots&#39; in the revised,
    interpolated version. I think your eye was better. With also the narrowing , it
    has moved toward wood type look which I don&#39;t particularly like, so this may
    be just my personal taste. The earlier version is, as I said, for me more fresh. '

  body: Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Here are some caps for you to chew on. These were
    a royal pain in the posterior. &#40;A shoutout to Christian Robertson for his
    encouragement on them&#41;. The results, I think, happily relate to the lc. I
    intoduced the semi serifs because there is a little semi serifage happening in
    the lc, but also because it countered the woodtype tendency and leaves it feeling
    fresh. After developing this weight I&#39;m pretty sure it will not be a straight
    interpolation to the regular weight. Too many quirks at this size. <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW
    I will be reproportioning the lc, per your comments Eduardo, William&#41; Thanks
    one and all! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24147.gif"

  body: 'Hey, that UC looks exactly right! Very nice work. And the semi-serif action
    is great - I wonder if you should turn some of the full-serifs &#40;like on the
    right leg of the &#34;A&#34;&#41; into semis. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t you think they&#39;re
    a little bit too small? I actually like smallish caps &#40;especially since they
    alleviate the need for &#34;true&#34; smallcaps - which very few people actually
    end up using&#41;, but maybe a hair larger would make them more in their [alphabetic]
    character. <BR> <BR>Some specifics: <BR>A: I might make the top curl less pronounced
    - maybe with a short flat segment on the top-left. Your structure is working great
    when on the bottom &#40;&#34;V&#34;, etc.&#41; but seems too soft on top. <BR>B:
    If you can do so without destroying the rigidity, try curving the top and bottom
    more out, to couteract the optical effect of bowing in. <BR>M: Isn&#39;t working.
    <BR>S: Too sharp inside. <BR>U: What about a full right stem? <BR> <BR>This font
    is getting amazing - I feel like squeezing the glyphs to get some chocolate icecream
    out of them! Cooper Black as a triathlete. Or a female bodybuilding champion.
