    not make what you feel like, rather than pandering to the market?\r\nIf you research
    what people like now, by the time your product is out it will be pass\xE9. If
    you attempt to anticipate where the market is heading, you are guessing.\r\nBesides,
    the minority of Typophile posters actually pay for fonts, they are either font
    producers or looking for the free equivalent of something commercial that is presently
    trendy.\r\nHowever, if you are attempting to take a snapshot of what\u2019s popular
    now, in order to avoid duplicating that sort of thing\u2014Respect!"

    Something along those lines. \r\n\r\nAll help will be appreciated.\r\nDavid"

    which was preceeded by some kind of letterprint-slab serif-DIY pastiche and before
    that we had a strong humanist-baroque serif revival period that folled the humanist
    sans serif period of the late 90's... so I'm guessing the next big thing is going
    to be psychedelic fonts, along with a big come back of Antique Olive and pastel
    colors.\r\n\r\nI actually enjoy very much using Futura ND, it\xB4s elegant (compared
    to Bitstream's or Adobe's) and energetic. I finally had the chance to use Caslon
    Big on a real project and I liked it very much.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to attempt

    to have been the ability to make people pander to him. He did not pander though,
    and nothing is better proof of that than the fact that Adobe Flash has permanently
    been banned from Apple mobile devices regardless of the consequences. Along those
    lines Jobs also had a rare gift of inherently knowing what people desired when
    those masses of people were mistaken about their own desires. That can't be done
    using market research and focus groups.\r\n\r\nThe same deal may pertain here
    with font selection, but it's a daunting and daring task."

    \u2260 most used. The typeface I use is usually determined by factors that trump
    my personal desire: Client has a preexisting corporate style, how it will look
    on the paper/screen, does it have characters/styles I might need down the line,
    etc.\r\n\r\nI usually buy a typeface because it is unlike anything I currently
    own (Cyclone, Deliscript, Paradigm), or it has significantly more features than
    something similar I may already have (Bookmania > Bookman Old Style, Harriet Text
    > Century Schoolbook). I'm also a sucker for sales and discount bundles of those
    types of fonts.\r\n\r\nAnother great incentive for me is a specimen that highlights
    the font's features, describes with some detail how the design came to be, and/or
    recommends an ideal/intended usage (agate/display, newsprint/screen, etc.)"

    not going to tell you because that is part of your assignment. You all need to
    sit down and figure out away to find out.  I don't just mean who to ask for the
    answer. I mean what would be a methodology for finding any target market?  That
    is because you are trying to learn something useful and repeatable for your area
    of study instead of just finishing this assignment.  This all gets in to what
    drives a particular market and how far ahead you need to be thinking.  Clearly,
