  letter-design so far. As I'm not very well experienced with designing and spacing
  a font, I'd like to ask for any advice for the spacing/kerning process.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone tell me a method, tutorial, manual, tips on approaching the spacing before
  I start hitting billions of disordered kerning pairs in the table? Can be a system
  of grouping the letters, finding the right basic space, or whatever.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"
