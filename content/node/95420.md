  moment and thought I'd open it up to discussion\r\nIdeally, the typefaces would
  be complimenting serif and sans serif in a large variety of weights, including condensed
  for the sans. They would have international character sets and perhaps phonetic
  characters. \r\n\r\nMy current favorite are (together) Mercury and Whitney by Hoefler
  and Frere-Jones\u2026 simply wonderful. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions/comments??  "

    in the typespec brief is \u201Cdictionary design\u201D?\r\n\r\nAt the very least,
    the relative merits of condensed, normal and extended might be discussed, in relation
    to how much cramming is necessary (assuming the product is in print, which is
    another spec that might be relevant)."

    (over 2,000 pages, published earlier this year), uses Arno and Myriad. To my eye
    it looks good.

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nOk, I see your point\u2026\r\n\r\nLayout would vary but mostly
    A5/Octavo or smaller. \r\n\r\nDictionaries are always printed on relatively thin,
    moderately absorbent papers, so the typeface would need to account for some ink
    squash, maybe with built in ink traps, and pared counter and apertures. \r\n\r\nI
    love the \"Extroversion\" of Whitney by H&FJ, meaning headwords would be cohesive
    in a tightly packed environment. \r\n\r\nBeyond this, there are all the usual
    requirements for a small font size and its condensed nature: enlarging the x-height
    to retain clarity and legibility, and at the same time, ascenders and descenders
    need to be kept relatively short to facilitate the tight leading required. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>Nonetheless, it does seem a bit vague when asking for typeface
    recommendations, to merely mention a genre of content, without reference to layout
    or medium.</blockquote>\r\nIt would be if you need a typeface for a specific project.
    As an open question I feel all the information was implied. If it didn't concern
    print I'm sure it would have been mentioned. Other than that, I don't think there
    are wildly different standards when it comes to dictionaries, are there? I think
    it's implied that you would need a pretty sturdy serif typeface with a relatively
    large x-height and unlike newspaper typefaces it shouldn't be too condensed or
    have a high contrast. If I were to ask for good newspaper typefaces, would you
    also need to know specifics or would you start naming newspaper typefaces you
    now will work well? Newspaper typefaces in general seem very typical.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Basically,
    you\u2019re con\uFB01ning yourself to clich\xE9, and thinking inside a very small
    box.</blockquote>\r\nDoesn't that describe a dictionary though? I'm all for innovation,
    but a dictionary doesn't seem to be the kind of medium where you can go wild.
    Perhaps I'm being narrow-minded, but can anyone give examples where something
    truly different has been done in a respectable dictionary?\r\n\r\nI would just
    like to name two typefaces I know were specifically designed with use for dictionaries
    in mind. Lexicon was designed to be used in the Dutch Van Dale dictionaries and
    Skolar is a sturdy typeface made for academic publications and dictionaries. Both
    typefaces have been designed to work well at small sizes."
