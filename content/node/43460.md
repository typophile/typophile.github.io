    book called <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Blogs-Masterworks-Vintage-Original/dp/0307278069/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206146798&sr=1-8\">Ultimate
    Blogs: Masterworks from the Wild Web</a></em>.\r\n\r\nOh, and here's another one

  body: " Thank you Ricardo. I read these books a little bit at the store, but these
    are not the kind I\u2019m searching for. I need more theoretical information about
    these things. Actually I ordered some books especially about Corporate/Business
    Blogs now. Will see \u2026 "

  body: A poem about books about blogs would be a great way to suss out the nuances
    a book about blogs might not capture.
