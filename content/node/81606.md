body: "I need advice on the most appropriate feature tag to use for discretionary
  substitution of word final letters by the miniscule superscript top mark forms found
  in the unicode ranges [0363 - 036F] and [1DD3 - 1DE6]. I am currently using 'clig'
  as a working feature tag and treating each minisculle superscript as a contextual
  ligature of a full stop plus its base glyph to be substituted whenever a space,
  comma, or another full stop follows.\r\n\r\nfeature clig { # contextual liguatures\r\n
  # Latin\r\n  sub period' a' @class58 by uni0363;\r\n  sub period' e' @class58 by
  uni0364;\r\n  sub period' i' @class58 by uni0365;\r\n  sub period' o' @class58 by
  uni0366;\r\n  sub period' u' @class58 by uni0367;\r\n  sub period' c' @class58 by
  uni0368;\r\n} clig;\r\n\r\nI would like a more elegant and more transparent way
  to accomplish the same end.\r\nAny suggestions? "
