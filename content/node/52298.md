body: "Trixie is a distressed monospaced serif typeface created by Dutch type designer,
  Erik Van Blokland, in 1991 using the inspiration of an old, worn typewriter. Probably
  the most famous presentation of a single letter is the Trixie capital X used in
  the title of the popular science fiction television series, \"The X-Files\".\r\n\r\nSince
  its release in 1991, from \u201CThe X-Files\u201D to  more recent appearances in
  \"Capote\" and \"Atonement\", FF Trixie has served as the defacto typeface of mystery
  and intrigue. Although there have been a number of typewriter-like designs, FF Trixie
  remains the most convincing, and accurate, typewriter font available.\r\n\r\nMore
  information, production samples and technical specifications are available at the
  [[http://trixiefont.com/ | Trixie Font Site]] and the [[http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/trixie
  | foundry site]]."
