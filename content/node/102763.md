  body: "Over 13 hours since your post and none of the type ID gurus have made a suggestion.\r\n\r\nSo
    here is what little I have to offer.\r\n\r\nPresumably this is from the title
    page of:\r\n \tMatisse: 50 years of his graphic art. Text by William S. Lieberman.\r\nPublisher
    New York : G. Braziller, 1956.\r\n\r\nI did some basic research at Myfonts using
    MATISSE as a specimen text and failed to find a digital font to match the treatment
    of S, T & E.\r\n\r\nIn 1956 this would probably have been a metal type or photo-type.
    Or perhaps custom artwork.\r\n\r\nSome similarity to Columbia, designed by a New
    York designer, Walter McKay, and  released in 1956 by Typefoundry Amsterdam. McGrew's
    American Metal Type only displays a small size, but it was available in up to
    60pt.\r\n\r\nAlso some similarity to Suburban French, Monotype.\r\n\r\nSo is there
    a digital match for MATISSE?\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Is there a digital match? I don't know. I expect it is hand lettering too.
    The title page and text uses Baskerville. The cover design features a dash of
    Venus Grotesque. I sniffed hints of other Bauer founts in the 'Matisse' lettering.
    Aspects of the design have a nagging familiarity though. The teeny serifs on the
    T. The contrasting bowls on the S. Where Have I seen that before? Was it the last
    time I looked at this book? Or was it something digital? Or is my ('I-like-these')
    client messing with my head? (The type style of the Venus isn't available digitally
    either.) But thank you very much for your efforts Don. Looks like redrawing it
    will be quicker than looking much further. (Or is it farther?)

  body: "I agree that since this does not ring a bell with anyone, redrawing is the
    way to go. It is really is a pastiche of well known features that I would not
    expect to find in the same font. Leaving aside the two pre-digital fonts I mentioned,
    there seems to be nothing very close.\r\n\r\nDon\r\np.s. further vs. farther --
    like the old tomayto tomahto joke :)\r\n"

    and \u201Cfurther\u201D for metaphorical, or figurative, distance. The Oxford
    English Dictionary, Fowler's Modern English Usage, and a number of other sources

    body: "Thank you for sharing the reference.\r\nA new one for me. Seems worth getting.
      Here is a blub for a later printing.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n++++\r\n\r\nW W Norton
      & Company Incorporated, 1995 - Design - 236 pages\r\nTreasury of Alphabets and
      Lettering is a classic source book of the most beautiful type and letters of
      all time selected by Jan Tschichold, internationally renowned typographer and
      master of lettering. It contains only letters of timeless and lasting beauty--the
      true mainsprings of the art of lettering. One hundred and seventy-six type specimens
      are presented, most of them in complete alphabets.\r\n\r\nThe introductory text
      provides a perceptive analysis of letter forms. Tschichold discusses lettering
      as a work of art, good and bad letters, older and recent letter forms, the use
      of capital and lower-case letters, word spacing, line spacing, the selection
      of appropriate letter styles, and the layout of groups of letters and signs.\r\n\r\nThe
      type specimens are handsomely reproduced, most in their original size. Every
      alphabet was specially arranged by Tschichold, and forms a well-balanced graphic
      design. Many of the outstanding historical sources appear better here than in
      the often poorly printed originals. The book is identical to the original edition,
      first published in 1966, with a new introduction by designer and writer Ben
      Rosen."
