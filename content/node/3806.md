  <BR>I am currently building a &#34;receipt&#34; gallery, &#40;that means &#34;printed
  bitmap type&#34;&#41;, and if you got original receipts with rude or well-done fonts,
  or crappy logos, please send 150 dpi scans to greg@bmap.info. <BR> <BR>oh, and for
  stimulation, check also Martin P. Pfeiffer&#39;s <A HREF="http://www.scootergraphics.com/receipt/index.html"

  body: ' A splendid idea, Greg. Receipts are pieces of everyday <BR>ephemera that
    nearly everyone has exposure to. They  <BR>are design in its most omnipresent
    form.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll contribute by sending along a list of fonts that could  <BR>be
    used for the printing of receipts. '

  body: ' In a very basic way, they are designed. Someone <BR>had to determine where
    the logo would go and <BR>in what order messages would appear and how <BR>purchased
    items and prices and totals would <BR>align. Beyond that, they are designed by
    chance <BR>and machine - and that can be interesting too. '

  body: ' That kind of design is my favorite one --- here, you have only these components/fonts/measurements/conditions...
    make what you can make of it. <BR>Build a house with these seven bricks. <BR>Make
    a painting with these four colors. <BR>you know what I mean. <BR>I was once involved
    in designing a ticket for the cinema, that was great fun. where should the price
    go, where should the movie title go, which text should be bigger, use font number
    1 or number 3?  hehe <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
