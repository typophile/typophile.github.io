  day and thought I would open the discussion here, as I am aware of the depth of
  knowledge present most days. This may have been raised before, but here goes...\r\n\r\nWe
  use image libraries often, all the usual ones without naming them, and we were contacted
  by one of them to let us know that they now offer hi-res images for use in client
  visuals. A great idea I thought. \r\n\r\nI have slight problem though, in that when
  putting together a presentation for a pitch, I want to try new typefaces in my designs
  that I don't yet own. The studio I work for won't buy new fonts until a job has
  been won, or the client requests it. So I'm stuck. It's very frustrating believe
  me. \r\n\r\nI just wondered what people's thoughts were on a temporary or short
  term license for fonts so as designers can utilise them in their presentations,
  and then if the job is won make the purchase?\r\n\r\nI work in the UK by the way
  and am recently graduated so there may be an answer already out there that I don't
  know about!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nR."

    in such a way that you get your clients to request the new typefaces ;-)\r\n\r\nOn
    a more serious note, Mr. Red, there <strong>are</strong> other ways to show fonts
    to clients without having them built into your presentation boards or slides.
    These include specimen book pages, print-outs from the online PDFs that many designers
    and foundries have on their websites, or jpgs taken from the letter-setters that
    most foundries offer online too.\r\n\r\nTry to get your client to sign-off on
    your overall concept first. Then say that, in order to get the message that they
    have already approved just right, you'll need to select the perfect typeface [together].
    Oftentimes, at this stage, clients will be willing to look at typesettings outside
    of the of client visuals, since they have already signed off on the photography,
    layout, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are just putting together first round comps,
    you can always use a typeface you already have in that, and then try to get the
    client to sign-off on a more specific font later. This has worked for me quite
    often. For instance, you can substitute Adobe Garamond with a more specific Garamond
    later, Futura with a newer geometric sans, etc.\r\n\r\nOn another note, <strong>some
    foundries do offer trial versions of their fonts</strong>, but not the same way
    your stock photo supplier offers images. FontShop seems to offer one weight of
    a family as a free trial download about every month. Many foundries will give
    you fonts on a trial basis if you call and/or e-mail their sales and/or marketing
    departments and let them know <strong>specifically</strong> what you are looking
    for.\r\n\r\nFor instance you could call them up and say, \"Hi, I'm working on
    a new ad campaign proposal for Coca-Cola in the US Northwest market. We're making
    new billboard designs and want to show the client our layout in Avenir and Candice.
    Can we use trial fonts for this presentation?\"\r\n\r\nThis comes across much
    better (and as much more believable) than an e-mail that says, \"Can you e-mail
    me your newest fonts so that I can spec them for some project, etc.?\" Once you
    buil up relationships with foundries and/or designers, this process gets easier,
    too. To a degree, its about trust, openness, and communication."

    client's company name in various case formats in pdf format for a similar kind
    of presentation, both were kind enough to send them. MAC Rhino and Underware were
    the foundries, but I'm sure there are many you could approach.\r\nTim"

  body: 'Oh I know this debate well. Then you purchase the font and the client changes
    their mind and  doesn''t want to pay for it. Ultimately nobody loses tho because
    if you really love a font you''ll use it for something else. '

  body: "Firstly thank you all for your replies.\r\n\r\nTo Dan, the thing is I only
    design the work, the presentation isn't made by myself, the creative directors
    see to that and they are the pnes that OK which fonts are purchased. \r\n\r\nI
    do also use pdf's and samples etc, but I find increasingly, especially lately,
    presentations are becoming slicker affairs with alot of placements of the identities
    so the client can visualise it in situ, I want to be free to use the font in a
    vast variety of visuals. \r\n\r\nThis whole thing is more a problem when I just
    don't have a similar looking enough font to what I want. Of course I agree with
    you I could do plenty of things, and try explanations to discuss what I want,
    but I can't help wanting to get my hands on fonts to really put them through there
    paces and let the client aknowledge that this font is the one from the word go!
    \r\n\r\nAnd also I didn't know that they may let me have trial use, I will have
    to try that.\r\n\r\nTo Pattyfab, I totally agree, and they would never 'go to
    waste', I would be itching to use a nice typeface in future projects, it's just
    it's not my call!\r\n\r\nAnyway you've opened my eyes, and thanksfor that, I would
    love to know what other type designers thought on this matter, would they have
    anything against this idea? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nR."
