  body: Are you supposed to design a whole <i>typeface,</i> i.e., a design for a font?
    This looks more like a collection of three graphic forms, or icons of some sort

  body: '&#34;Unpopular&#34; implies some level of injustice. There is none. ITC Garamond
    is sick on a number of levels. Choosing it as an archetype of serif fonts is not
    good. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I am studying a a degree in Contemporary Graphic Design, the brief also stipulates
    that although the use of classic typefaces will be the foundation of the font
    and must include elements used from each font, the fonts must not be initially
    indentifiable. We are only created 26 Uppercase characters. I chose Garamond ITC
    as I was after a rounded serif rather than a slab or calligraphic serif. &#40;any
    other suggestions would be grateful&#41;.

  body: Well, any other Garamond would be better &#40;Adobe Garamond, Stempel Garamond,
    Sabon, Sabon NEXT, etc.&#41; Adobe&#39;s Minion might be another good choice,
    as would any Bembo, Caslon, or Baskerville
