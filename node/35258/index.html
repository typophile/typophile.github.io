<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I came across a strange thought of kerning in real life. I was thinking where else can we find kerning beside type? And saw we use kerning eveywhere. It's just called differently. One name for it in real life would be "double measure" when you apply different principals/acting/behaviour/etc. with different ethnicity/gender/etc.
Can you come up with kerning in other areas of life? Mechanics perhaps? Other professions?
Seeing that kerning exists eveywhere made me think why the **** did <cite>they</cite> name it "kerning" in type design?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think it refers to the need to physically remove a little bit of metal from a piece of type. Maybe related to kernel.

Anyone have an unabridged OED or a subscription to the site? (Edit: See above.)
Regarding analogous kerning-esque activities, is it accurate to say you're looking for examples of people moving things around with the aim of modulating space? Depending on how broad you want to take it, landscapers, plastic surgeons, and all manner of artists do this as a matter of routine. But then you could also say a pugilist kerns his/her fist to an opponent's face. </div>

<div class=commentbody>littera: <cite>why the **** did they name it “kerning” in type design?</cite>
Well, the question is really why do <em>we</em> call it "kerning." <em>They</em> had something slightly different in mind when the term was coined.
"Kerning" is one of those terms that has been leveraged from one technology to the next, to the point where it's evolved quite a bit from its origins, not unlike "leading."
Here's a relevant excerpt from Harry Carter's translation of <cite>Manuel Typographique,</cite> the 18th-century manual on typefounding by Fournier le Jeune.
"Another essential operation performed with the same knife is <em>kerning.</em> This is a matter of hollowing out beneath the little projecting strokes which overlap the shanks upon which the letters are cast. In the roman alphabet this occurs in the case of f, [long-s], ff, [double-long-s]. These characters have isolated beaks which are only supported by being joined on by the face to the rest of the letter. Kerning consists in hollowing out the under-sides of these beaks so that they may overhang the letter which adjoins them. When these little beaks are kerned, the edge of the knife is passed up and down the shank on the kerned side."
[from <cite>Fournier on Typefounding</cite> (1764), Harry Carter, trans., 1930]
The term in Fournier's original is <em>crénerie (n.)/créner (v.)</em>, from which, I believe, the English "kern" is derived. Moxon is earlier than Fournier. He would have gotten his information probably via the French, possibly the Dutch. I wonder if he coined the English term. I'm not sure why the dictionaries cite <em>carne</em> as the French source. I'd be curious to see what they use to support this derivation.
Because of the tremendous work involved and the fragility of the results, few characters were designed to have kerns (i.e. overhanging parts) in metal.
It is only when you come to the photo and digital ages, with virtual sidebearings, that you begin to encounter the kind of widespread contextual repositioning that we think of as kerning today.

I thought of this too. And kerning (in this way) is somewhat regional - here in NY we get used to being jam packed up against strangers in the subway. But if someone were to stand that close to you in a shopping mall you'd call the police.

<div class=commentbody>An interesting bit related to the definitions already posted above...
The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glossary-Typesetting-Chicago-Writing-Publishing/dp/0226183718/ref=sr_1_1/105-4304836-8465243?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1184896845&sr=1-1"><em><strong>Glossary of Typesetting Terms</strong></em></a>, after its definition of <strong>kern</strong>, refers the reader to the term
<strong>Mortise</strong>: (1) In <strong>handset type</strong>, to "pull" letters closer together by cutting away metal. The term has been to some extent carried over into computer composition, in which <strong>kern</strong> is sometimes applied to either adding or reducing space between character pairs; mortise always means reducing space. (2) When <strong>repro</strong> paper is mounted on boards, to cut a hole in the repro paper so that another piece of repro paper with a correction fits snugly into it. It is wise to mortise corrections in repro paper when they are quite small (a letter, a word, etc.) so that they will stay in place. Also called <em>cutting in</em>.</div>
