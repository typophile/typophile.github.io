    is acceptable use of the font and often includes a clause for such things as modifying
    and use of the modified font. \r\n\r\nEach foundry is different, so the best thing
    to do is to go and check out the ELUA on the vendors website and see what they
    have to say about it."

  body: "The law will allow the appropriation of letterforms, but not \"point piracy\"
    -- i.e. tampering with font software. This creates the strange scenario where
    typefaces that look a lot more like Gill than yours are legal because they were
    created with fresh BCPs, whereas yours, which is conceptually quite a stretch
    from the original, is illegal because you started with someone else's digital
    data.\r\n\r\nI think the law is correct, because the intent is to stop cheating
    (i.e. capitalizing on someone else's work and taking a short-cut to the finished
    product), but not to give creators the kind of monopoly that censors cultural
    give-and-take. One issue is that this distinction is abused by foundries that
    knock off designs, but nonetheless remain within the letter of the law by making
    fresh outlines. Another issue is that sampling is a legitimate creative technique
    in the digital era, but its legality is problematic for copyright laws that were
    developed much earlier.\r\n\r\nSo, if you were to print out your font, scan it,
    paste the images in the mask layer, and then use the pen tool to trace the outline
    of the glyphs, that would make it copasetic.\r\n\r\nOf course, you would have
    to make the metrics from scratch -- and that's an important chunk of work that
    isn't usually figured into the ethical equation. "

  body: "Nick, I believe it is actually more complex than that. If the original EULA
    permitted modifying for one's own use, and the intended recipient had also purchased
    the same font, with the same EULA, I believe it could be given to that person.
    If EULA's never changed, as long as both parties owned a license, both could have
    the modified font, as long as the \"number of computers installed on\" was adheared
    to. But EULA's do change.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I believe in Europe, you can copyright
    the design as well as the software that renders the font. Correct me if I'm wrong.
    But I hear you loud & clear on the big foundries rip-offs. I believe Monotype
    was once sued over that; in the States, anyway, the ripoff of the \"design only\"
    was OK, since the data was not taken.\r\n\r\nIn passing, when Apple sued Microsoft
    (over Windows), I always wondered why Xerox didn't file suit against Apple . .

    transferring. Further, and even less likely, it probably didn't allow for derivatives,
    or in other words, versions of the fonts to be given away for free or sold for
    profit. Given that Gill is owned by and/or licensed from Monotype I'd say you
    are stepping of shady ground in all 3 counts.\r\n\r\nNick, however, makes a good

    are geographic location sensitive. Adobe's EULA allows for modifications, but
    then that modified version becomes one of the copies licensed. Or in other words,
    if the given EULA (Adobe's in this case) is for 5 workstations, and you modify
    it to be used on 2 workstations, you only have 3 un-modified workstations left.
    \r\n\r\nAck! A math problem. Run!\r\n\r\n(It's late I shouldn't be righting about

    a lawyer's effort to protect his client -- the type founder/seller. The language
    used is to me incomprehensible, but that's not the point. What I assume is going
    on is the lawyer is trying to help his client from (1) not losing sales, and (2)
    not looking foolish, should someone poorly modify a font.\r\n\r\nIf I hold a license
    and modify a font for my use (when permitted), another holder of the same license
    could hire me to modify <cite>their</cite> font. Of course it counts as one of
    the permitted copies. But exactly the same situation results if I just send them
    a copy of my modification. Nobody's lost any money they would otherwise receive.
    I assume that's the point of the license in the first place.\r\n\r\nIsn't this
    correct?"

    I think you are creating a significant departure from the original face while

    worked on a font based on the free font champion, which is the only font close
    to Boltana's Champion I have ever been able to find. I have numerised new glyphs
    based on an article by Boltana. I just use the font privately, but if I were to
    give it to friends, would I be infriging the law?"

    different from those in the States, but even so, since it isn't a direct visual
    copy, I would think it is not an issue. Otherwise, all the larger foundries would
    constantly be suing each other -- and some of the smaller ones, too.\r\n\r\nAs
    to the free font: Cost & license are unrelated. You may well have accepted a licensing
    agreement when you downloaded the font. There are free fonts that have more restrictive
    agreements than fonts you pay for. Check the EULA of your free \"Champion\" to
    see."

  body: "From a design perspective (legal issues put aside):\r\n\r\nI consider it
    dangerous to start with an existing font, or with an existing non-digital type
    design: The original design may shine through even if you changed every detail.
    Design is more than serif forms, curves, stem width, sharp or curved edges, some
    ornamental addition, even proportions -- it is the 'mind' or 'logic' or 'rules'
    which make the various details a unity. Changing one or some of these details
    may just break the design, but most likely produce something derivative. Starting
    with something existing requires a deep understanding of the original design to
    do something truely different.\r\nIf I look at the rounded extra bold Gill Sans,
    I think what is so interesting about it (despite having round edges which is a
    current trend) are the proportions and the funny stroke contrast in the 'a' 'e'
    'f', and the Sisyphean 'i'-dot, all of which are in the original design. Moreover,
    the rounded version inherits all shortcomings of the original design.\r\nTo make
    more evident what I mean: Do with Helvetica what you did with Gill Sans. Notice
    the difference?"

    to claim more authorship of the new design, and also to better suit the letter

    Haley should probably take a few liberties with the underlying structure, both

    rounded version very carefully to find out what makes it so special, then put
    it aside and draw something based on the special elements. This makes it also
    necessary to think about, how do I solve the 'n' shoulder? and which shape do
    I give the 'b' 'd' 'p' 'q' bowls and how do they intersect with the stem? Maybe
    the result will be even more radical than the ultra bold Gill Sans? I think this
    is a very funny game.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\nStarting from zero (of course you have
    many typefaces in mind and even 'cite' this or that one) prevents you from the
    question you asked in the first place.\r\nSorry that my other post sounds rude,
    Haley. It was the combination with the Didot question which I found alarming.
    My opinion is: It is ok to modify a typeface for one's own use if the EULA allows.
    A very good exercise too. But the designer or foundry may not be too happy if
    one would start distributing a 'better' version of their typeface. (Irrespective
    if it's distributed for free or not, or if receivers do or don't have licensed
    the original version or not.) To me, this is more a fairness than a legal issue,
    both as regards intellectual and physical work on which one builds."
