  body: That's why I haven't bothered...what is it, $90 per font?! We had a mention
    of it before here, and I believe one response was that it didn't match up that
    well, that the extra weights were gilding the lily, plus the price factor...I
    wouldn't mind ONE more weight to Sabon just for now and then, but not at that
    price. But I myself saw no particular problem with how it looked or matched the
    older family, just the price.
