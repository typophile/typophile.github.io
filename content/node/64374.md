  is Quincha, the new type-release by Cocijotype, its designer Diego Sanz based his
  work on incan walls, which fit their stones perfectly one to another. Quincha has
  10 stylistic alternates to build your own wall, moreover, it has a large amount
  of contextual alternates (over 700). You can get it at <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cocijotype/quincha/\">MyFonts.</a>\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nEli"
