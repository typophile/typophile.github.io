  Holmes (1983). I cannot seem to find the font anywhere, and no automated services
  are even coming close. Any ideas as to what font to look for? Even something close
  while keeping a similar look (especially with the ABFGQVWYabfghjkqtvwy characters
  on this image.\r\n\r\nI created this image by going through the film, tracing the
  characters, cleaning them up as vectors in Illustrator, and arranging them on the
  following image.\r\n\r\nAny advice is incredibly helpful! Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SherlockFont_4819.png]"
