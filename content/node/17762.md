body: Suggestions for a cheap or free font editor for Windows? I'd basically just
  like to edit kerning tables and keyboard layout - not design fonts.

  body: FontForge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/) is a free font editor that is
    quite useful.  However, it's been developed for Unix and hence non-trivial to
    run under Windows.  But if you feel technically inclined, you should give it a
    try.

    body: Cheap? How about under $99. I know TypeTool is available for that price.
      I guess I was looking for something cheaper until I purchase Fontographer or
      Fontlab studio, or one of the DTL products.

  body: You don't need a font editor to edit keyboard layouts, you need a keyboard
    layout editor. Hacking font encodings to access glyphs from a keyboard is a really
    bad idea.

  body: i bought a version of the old Macromedia [[Fontographer]] on ebay for ~$70.
    That should work for what you want to do. (but i don't see any copies on ebay
    at the moment...) If you will only be working with TTF fonts, you can check out
    [[Font Creator]] from www.high-logic.com.

  body: "\r\nTypeTool 2.0 is available from Fontlab Ltd. at US$99 (http://www.fontlab.com/typetool/
    ).  \r\n\r\nAn older version, TypeTool 1.3, was given away with some computer
    magazines across Europe e.g. Easy PC (UK, issue 20/2004), Computer Arts Projects
    (UK, issue 57/2004), Computer Arts (UK, issue 95, April 2004), Computer Arts (France,
    issue 74, January 2005), Computer Magazine (Italy, issue 96, February 2005), Il
    mio computer (Italy, issue 120, June 2005). If you can find any of these issues,
    you can get TypeTool 1.3 with them and then upgrade to TypeTool 2.0 at US$39.95.
    \r\n\r\nTypeTool for Windows supports PC Type 1 (.pfb) and PC TrueType / OpenType
    TT (.ttf) fonts. TypeTool for Mac also supports Mac Type 1 (LWFN/FFIL) and Mac
    TrueType fonts. \r\n\r\nFont Creator 5.0 from http://www.high-logic.com/fontcreator.html
    is available at US$65 (Home Edition) and US$99 (Pro Edition). It supports PC TrueType
    (.ttf) fonts and is able to open but not generate OpenType  PS (.otf) fonts. \r\n\r\nFontForge
    (http://fontforge.sf.net ) is the cheapest (free) and supports practically all
    major font formats but is rather awkward to use. I believe that it requires more
    knowledge of font format specifics than the two above. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam

      soon after I purchase the upgrade.

    thing because skills aquired in TypeTool will mostly apply if you move to FontLab
    later. FontLab has many features that or only used by a handful of users, so for
    a novice user it's actually good to have a UI that's focused on building basic,
    functional fonts. \r\n\r\n<cite>Any news on TypeTool 3.0? :-)\r\n\r\nI assume

  body: "The Ikarus V4 system represents the high end of the font production tools.
    It is still under development at URW++ and also available for Mac OS X / X11.
    The system contains a couple of graphical editors, but most modules work via the
    command line or via command files. The syntax used for the command files is fairly
    simple. \r\n\r\nA lot of the batch functionality found in the Ikarus V4 system
    has been ported to DTL FontMaster and is much more user friendly. For several
    batch functions the same Ikarus command language can be used. There is no external
    scripting module necessary in FM for things like the exchange of data between
    multiple glyph databases, placing of accents, replacement of composites, consistency
    checking, improving, et cetera. For many of these functions also command files
    can be used. The separation of the glyph data at one hand and the character naming,
    Unicode numbering, metrics and naming information at the other hand, which finds
    its origin in the Ikarus system, is a necessity for handling and controlling font
    data on a professional level. OpenType layout features can be easily generated
    for multiple fonts at once by simply selecting a Features file.\r\n\r\nIn the
    new FM 2.5 version font importing and exporting can be done now directly in the
    Bezier and Ikarus editors. The drawing capabilities have been enhanced and more
    batch functionality has been added. For those who can manage without an updated
    manual and have no problem with the AGL 1.2 compatible Character Layout files,
    a pre-release version of DTL FontMaster 2.5 Light can be downloaded from http://www.fontmaster.nl/Temporary/FM2.5_Light_PR.html"
