body: I want some books on learning calligraphy. One friend recommended [[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1579908098/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&v=glance|this
  one]], and Amazon suggests [[http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st?keywords=calligraphy&rs=1000&page=1&rh=n%3A1000%2Ck%3Acalligraphy&sort=relevancerank|these]],
  but I'd like to get suggestions from other people here. What books do you recommend?
  Is there a calligrapher's bible equivalent to <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>?

    is probably <a href=\"http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/2743301597.08.LZZZZZZZ.jpg\">Mediavilla\u2019s</a>."

    that one is [[http://livre.fnac.com/a984983/Claude-Mediavilla-Calligraphie|here]],
    where it costs 51\u20AC including shipping. Do you know where else I can find
    it? Considering how expensive it is, I'll probably not get this one unless I find
    it much cheaper elsewhere or you say it really is that good."

  body: "I'll second the suggestion of the Speedball book. It's reprinted every few
    years so there are thousands floating around including new ones in bookstores.
    It's not the only, or the best for models, but it does focus on this basic information.
    \r\n\r\nThe thing you seem to want is models for alphabets, as well as correct
    stroke formation and order. Learn those basic things for several styles of alphabet
    and then, after gaining correct form and spacing, develop consistency and then
    speed. There are dozens of books out there, but very few offer a complete set
    of historical models of each style (Imperial caps, chancery, fraktur, schwabacher,
    rotunda, uncial, half-uncial, Carolingian lowercase, etc.). Those models will
    give you the foundation on which to build.\r\n\r\nI'd also look for direct sources
    rather than interpretations by the various authors of manuals. There ought to
    be clear images of historical manuscripts showing the original calligraphy, not
    just the instructor's version of them. \r\n\r\nExcellent 20th-century calligraphers
    to observe: Hermann Zapf, F. Ernst Schneidler, Werner Schneider, Albert Kapr,
    Georg Trump, Rudolf Koch, Oldrich Menhart, Karlgeorg Hoefer, Helmut Salden, Imre
    Reiner, Martin Wilke, Alfred Linz, Friedrich Poppl, Gunnlaugur Briem, Julian Waters,
    Villu Toots, John Stevens, Michael Clark, Jovica Veljovic. There are many more,
    but I think it's good to get a sense of the different styles. Some calligraphers
    have very conservative, classical style, some are more rough and visceral. Contrast
    Waters with Koch, and Hoefer with Toots. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that all these calligraphers
    develop their styles from the foundational alphabets. It's learning the rules
    completely that allows them to break them; they are able to make strong, individual
    works because they have mastered traditional calligraphic styles. I think the
    German calligraphers in particular exhibit the complete discipline that allows
    them to explore variations. There have been so many amazing German calligraphers,
    and so few of their caliber elsewhere. "
