  type designers that would design fonts specifically for us.  We would buy them outright,
  and use them to design our products with.   We have already done two custom fonts,
  but would like to do more. If you are interested email me at daveu@uppercaseliving.com.
  \ Also check out our website at www.uppercaseliving.com. Lets see if your font can
  outsell some of our customer favorites!\r\n\r\nDave"
