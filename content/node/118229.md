  trying to identify the font used for the \"LLIVANDERS\" part of this logo. The \"O\"
  is obviously a custom design, but the rest is similar to, but not quite several
  fonts I have looked at, including Caslon Open Face LT, Century Std Handtooled Bold,
  Richler Highlight, and Imprint MT Shadow. Either the cusp of the serif at the top
  of the \"A\" is missing, or the fill is too heavy, or something. If it can't be
  identified, I would appreciate any opinions about which would be the best \"close\"
  choice.  Thanks so much!"
