  body: No alternate I know of. i think the simply replaced the vertical stroke bottom
    with that of the 'h'.

  body: "Not to be too persnickety about terminology, but the style of typeface you
    needed identified is known as blackletter/black letter (and that particular variant
    is called Fraktur).\r\n\r\nGothic and Grotesque/Grotesk generally refer to sans
    serif faces (particularly early variants).\r\n\r\nCheck out the Adobe type classification
    for a generalized display of <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/classifications.html\"
    target=\"new\"><strong>type classifications</strong></a>.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this
    is Typophile ;^)"
