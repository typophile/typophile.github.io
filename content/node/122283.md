body: "Good day everyone,\r\n\r\nI have been considering a realign of my families
  brand for a few years, and the legibility of the current logo has recently been
  discussed and not being ready for moving into a larger market, which we are considering.
  \r\n\r\nI am an amateur at this, and before I go stumbling through this process,
  I was wondering if you all had any suggestions on where to start. \r\n\r\nThis is
  what I am starting with: http://i.imgur.com/gsk45Dz.jpg\r\n\r\nFor some background,
  this was hand lettered by a calligrapher friend of my Mother's about 20 years ago,
  and I was put in charge of digitizing it for advertising. I made a vector version
  in Illustrator 3, and stayed as true to the original as possible, even the uneven
  curves. As we have moved to the web, and billboards, the vector version has been
  updated to be a bit more legible, lightening the accent lines, and bringing a bit
  of depth into the main letterforms at the request of my family members (I like it
  just flat black). \r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for is a typographic direction to move
  in to retain the character, but increase legibility and refresh the brand a bit.
  There are some bits that seem based on the Blackletter Rotunda style, with a heavy
  Uncial primary character, but I am at a loss for what I should be looking for to
  replace it or at least to clean it up.\r\n\r\nI have considered replacing it entirely,
  and just finding a good pseudo-Uncial to work with, or modernizing it and making
  a nice and clean logotype without the baggage, so to speak. There are a lot of people
  I know of and respect on these boards, and I am just looking for a bit of guidance
  before it hit the big-bad dark forest alone. \r\n\r\nThanks very much in advance,\r\nA
  type-piker. "

    for you to follow the Jewelry logo design galleries you can found inspiring and
    creative design ideas form them.. \r\n\r\nDon't be follow others suggestions they
    have their own points of views.. You go with your own mind.."

  body: "You might want to back up a step or two and ask yourself what personality
    your business has, what personality you want it to have and what audience you're
    targeting.\r\n\r\nNot knowing anything about your your jewelry business, I really
    can't say what's appropriate. Your existing logo, however, is complicated and
    nostalgic. I hope this doesn't come out wrong, but it doesn't say jewelry to me
    as much as it suggests old-fashioned confectionaries, sarsaparillas, horseless
    carriages and my great grandfather's antique pocket watch.\r\n\r\nIf that's the
    look that you want and feel is most appropriate for your business, great; it's
    probably time to think about cleaning up the lettering a bit. On the other hand,
    if the business might benefit from something a bit more contemporary and more
    apt to appeal to a younger target audience, you might want to consider a more
    fundamental redesign.\r\n\r\nWould an old-fashioned look be most appropriate,
    or should it be a bit more modern? Should it be sleek and svelte or elegant and
    elaborate? Should it appeal to wealthy 50-somethings or style-conscious, but not-quite-so-wealthy
    30-year-olds? I guess what I'm saying is that it generally helps to decide on
    a destination before changing one's clothes."

  body: "Agree with Thylacine's comments. \r\n\r\nIt's difficult to judge a logo without
    knowing much more about your company, the style of your shop, your future plans,
    your competitors, etc. \r\n\r\nIt looks very old-fashioned. If you have a quaint,
    old-fashioned store that might be appropriate. But if that's not the image you're
    looking for, a fresh start might be more appropriate than tweaking the old one."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, and to answer your questions about tone and theme,
    I think we are wanting to move in a more \"modern\" and \"sophisticated\" direction,
    while maintaining a tie to the pseudo-Victorian flavor, since we specialize in
    antique jewelry.\r\n\r\nI attempted to examine the House Luxury typefaces for
    a possible replacement, but their licensing seems to be a bit... difficult, considering
    this will be going on ring boxes, bags, identity stationery, and signage at least.
    I even looked at generic solutions to just increase legibility at a distance with
    engraving-based type, which instead of making it look more refined, only served
    to make it look pedestrian. \r\n\r\nAt any rate, thanks very much, I will wrestle
    with this some more, and if anyone has any more suggestions, they will all be
    accepted thankfully and thoughtfully. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nA Letter-Err-er"

    If money is tight a graphic design student at a nearby college might take it on
    for a minimal fee."

    afraid here calligraphy and lettering skills are needed first.\r\nAdding to what
    was already said, I think the mark needs to be redrawn, regardless of if or how
    much you want to \u201Cmodernise\u201D it. If anything the curves on the initials
    need to be cleaned up (or, if deemed appropriate, given a proper quill/brush rough
    effect), and the repeating letters need to be harmonised.\r\nThat said, I like
    the overall lombardic feel of it, and think that, if you restrain its swirls a
    bit, the |A| would make a very nice mark/punch for jewellery."

  body: "Sorry to bump an old thread but if you're wanting to clean it up i'd personally
    remove the grey decorative stuff from the logotype and maybe simplify and reduce
    the flourishes on the capital letters. Neaten up the curves of all the letters
    and maybe try increasing the contrast between stroke widths.\r\n\r\nThe 'n's look
    very gaelic rather than germanic in the original example. Maybe have a search
    for some contemporary celtic / gaelic uncial type for some inspiration."
