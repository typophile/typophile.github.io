body: "Hi.\r\nI\u2019m looking for information about Inter-type.In the book \"Sans
  Serif. The ultimate sourcebook of classic and contemporary sans serif typography\"
  by Cees W. de Jong, apear the Bulletin n\xBA 2 of Nebitype, Tur\xEDn. In this bulletin
  we can read \"Inter-Grotesk\" in the name of a new Nebitype face which is being
  cut now and which will be available between the end fo this year and the beginning
  of 1966\". \"We have decide to make this type face available in order to meet the
  requirements of those customers in a type face similar to \"Helvetica\" and \"Univers\".
  In fact \"Inter-Grotesk\" is based on our Recta,many letters of which that the linear
  and geometrical forms of Recta are a little too soft and not massive enough\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have information about this typeface? images? typespecimen? Who designed
  this italian neogrotesk??\r\n\r\nthanks\xA1\xA1\r\n\r\nMarcos"
