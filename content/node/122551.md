  body: A number of the 1965 edition are for sale for around $225 - do not know if
    they have less content but have 970 pages. The one above sounds interesting but
    costly.

  body: "This edition is the very first Alphabet Thesaurus from Photo-Lettering, Inc.
    Released in 1960. It is the professional edition and has nothing to do with other
    editions. The main thing is that many alphabets found inside were not reissued
    in the other editions.\r\n\r\nAlso, it\u2019s usually found in poor condition
    with the spine detached.\r\n"
