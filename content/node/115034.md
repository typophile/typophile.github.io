  a class on font creation at this year's <strong>Legacies II\u2014 the International
  Calligraphy Conference</strong> in Dallas. I'll be teaching the basics of how to
  use FontLab and Fontographer. The conference is a week long (July 19-26) and the
  class is called <strong>Tool2Type</strong>. It's a 2.5 day class, and you can learn
  more about the conference at this address:\r\n\r\nhttp://calligraphyconference.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57\r\n\r\nSo,
  if you or someone you know is interested in taking a class and begin making fonts,
  check it out.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tool2type_5593.png]"
