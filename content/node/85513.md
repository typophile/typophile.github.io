  know this creates a limitation but I tend to think things are evolving, I don't
  want to build fonts compatible with Win98 or something.\r\n\r\nIn other hand I know
  some famous software still lacks Opentype kern support, more notably Myfonts site
  and OS X Font Book (already filled a feedback form here http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html)
  \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts about this subject? "

  body: I build my kern tables in MetricsMachine, export a feature file, and compile
    it into my fonts. Non-Opentype kerning does not exist within my workflow. I guess
    if big publisher ever wanted a 1,000-seat license with type 1 fonts I would be
    screwed, but otherwise it saves me from a lot of headaches.

    I use that renders Opentype Kern feature.\r\nNo luck with Chrome or Safari in
