  chracters. There's Chinese, Japanese, Arab, Hebrew, Indonesian etc even Thai (and
  Vietnamese If I remember correctly). But not Korean's. Why is it so unpopular?\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I assume you mean Latin-alphabet typefaces whose glyphs mimic the shapes
    of other scripts.\r\n\r\nI'm Korean and I find it very difficult to imagine a
    Latin typeface resembling the Korean script (an alphabet called hangul). At best
    you would merely be using elements of a typical hangul typeface such as the serif
    treatment, but the results would look nothing like the Korean script. Hangul has
    a specific look because of the way the alphabetic elements are arranged in syllabic
    blocks.\r\n\r\nWith Chinese (especially simplified Chinese), there are certain
    characters that have a low stroke count that bear a resemblance to letters of
    the Latin alphabet, and the same goes for letters in hiragana and katakana (Japanese)
    and indic-derived writing such as the Thai script. (I'm not sure what you mean
    by Indonesian and Vietnamese, as both use the Latin alphabet.) There is no obvious
    way you can apply this to hangul. Demonstrating why this is so would be a bit
    involved, but maybe you can try to look for samples of Korean writing and figure
    out for yourself why."

    my finite 'creative-layman-talent' I'd probably need a couple of years to get
    that figure out, lol.\r\nSo while I'm at it, I'm more interested in finding out
    how / where to get such typeface.\r\n\r\nBut I supposed you meant to say it doesn't
    exist coz of it's, uhmm...specific characteristics/elements? Yes?\r\n"

  body: "I don't even think I'm going out on a limb when I say that in all likelihood,
    the kind of typeface you're looking for does not exist. The difficulty level of
    assembling a faux-Korean Latin-alphabet typeface would be close to that of designing
    a Latin-alphabet typeface by picking flags of different nations to stand for each
    of the letters. To make it work, you would have to deconstruct the source material
    to the point that it would no longer be recognizable.\r\n\r\nNow, what you're
    looking for <em>might</em> work with a very simple and short combination of letters,
    as for logos. The hangul glyph \uD2F0 could stand for 'El', perhaps, and \uC560
    for 'OH'. But we are talking about a really, really limited application here,
    and I don't see how a whole typeface could come out of this."
