  but cant find a match.\r\nI tried My Fonts and Identifont. Closest thing was Din,
  but there's a lot of differences.\r\nThe G,C & O definitely do not match. Please
  help.\r\n\r\nOh, also the left of the B got cut off a little, it's the same width
  as the I.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nryan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sans_face_3649.jpg]"

  body: Yep! Thank you, Akira. I thought it was something by Ascender but couldn't
    find it on their retail site because this is for Xbox only.
