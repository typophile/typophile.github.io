body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm studying graphic design in Finland and am quite new to the
  world of typography. I have been reading this forum for a some time now, and the
  time has come to ask for your assistance with a font from a logotype.\r\n\r\nI tried
  identifying the font at WhatTheFont, without luck. I think it has some similarities
  with bold and semibold cuts of Stone Serif, Cambria, Georgia and some Garamonds.
  Having read my Bringhurst, I think it has some baroque (drop terminal \u2018a\u2019,
  moderate aperture, axis) but it looks modern to me. The serifs (or stem) on \u2018n\u2019
  and variable terminals should make it easier to identify. I am quite sure it's something
  really obvious, I just don't see it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRiku"
