body: "Dear all,\r\n\r\nI'm currently writing up the long overdue second episode of
  my Type Design series, a collection of entry-level articles for Unzipped to promote
  awareness of type design. This instalment I'll be looking at the technical aspect
  of drawing, optical correction and ink traps, then at spacing and kerning. If you
  have any images related to these subjects could you please send them to me. As you
  can see from the reactions to <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=161\">last
  episode</a> (scroll all the way down), this kind of images is very popular with
  the readers.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure what I'm getting at, take a look at the <a
  href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=161\">first episode</a>, and below
  is an image I will be using.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCOfficina_notes_5050.jpg]"

    web site]] teaching type design has a lot of good drawings on the technical aspects
    and optical correction. \r\n\r\nMark Jamra's essays at the end of [[http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/|
    this list]] also have nice illustrations. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
