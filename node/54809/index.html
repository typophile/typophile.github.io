  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello! I've been working on this logo for a bit. It's not really a big deal - I'm doing it as a favor for my Aunt. It's for her church's youth group. I'm pretty happy with the image, but I feel like the image and the type are very disconnected - in a bad way. I would really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!

(I'm hoping you can see what I was going for, but in case you can't, I will explain. The dove is a well-known symbol of christianity, it is also supposed to serve as a hand holding a compass. If you're okay with a bit of a stretch, the inside of the compass kind of alludes to the Star of Bethlehem. But I realize that doesn't necessarily come across, and I'm okay with that.)</div>

Perhaps the dove/hand/compass logo should be allowed to dominate the arrangement? Seems to me that the lettering is 'shouting too loud' next to the image, rather than supporting it.

What would you say to trying 'compass ministries' in smaller capitals, on two lines – above and below the image – centred and generously letterspaced? Maybe try a serif style to contrast against the forms of the logo? Good luck with it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some observations at a glance:
<ol><li>The metaphor hand-as-a-dove has been profusely used; it's not necessarily a weakness, but I guess I've seen that precise image before (try these bad samples: [[http://www.alohapeaceproject.com/images/index/Logo.jpg|Aloha]], [[http://www.coalitionforkids.ca/images/coalition-for-kids-dove-logo.png|CFKI]] or [[http://scarletowls.urfcomics.com/images/AboutBITHTileLogo.gif|BITH]]).</li>
<li>The compass doesn't seem that to me; I see a quirky 16-hours-clock, instead; probably you should quit some elements (it is quite busy), and enlarge orthogonal  beams in the rose; better: you could try tilting the vertical ones.</li>
<li>Perhaps the disconnection you notice is in the font itself –I wonder who's its designer–, because it looks oddly geometric –and I appreciate Geometry a lot–, really ugly as sin (or that's what my displeased perception feels).</li></ol>
Nevertheless, I think your concept has potential. Just need more sensitive work.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Ben you should try the two lines/generously spaced/serif solution; by the other side, all lowercase tends to be annoying and less readable, though overused.

		<div class="commentbody">The font itself is incredibly wonky and unbalanced. I see technical problems in nearly every letter. I suggest shopping for a better quality font.

I also agree with Marcelo about the symbol; it's painfully common to see a dove/hand used for a church. Why not make the compass itself into a logo? Perhaps with the arrow pointing to a cross? 

For a youth group, I'm picturing an edgy/rugged yet sharp style (think Swiss Army) that appeals more to teens. I'd look at vintage compasses for inspiration, like [[http://thevintageaviator.co.nz/files/images/pilots-possessions/preview/pilots_possessions-004-rfc-wrist-compass.preview.jpg|this one]] from [[http://thevintageaviator.co.nz|The Vintage Aviator]].</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, now that I'm looking at it on here, the compass is a bit busy. I'll work on that a bit more, make it more recognizable. And I realize that the dove/hand thing might be used a lot, but really, when it comes to churches, what isn't cliche? There's really not much that hasn't been beaten to death there. Even your compass w/ cross thing, I've seen it many times. Alright, back to the drawing board. New typeface. Above and below. New image altogether. I will try it all. Thanks for your comments!</div>

What isn't cliché? Heh. I used to work in the peace movement; seen more hands'n'doves than I could shake a (pacifist) stick at. But sometimes clichés are all we got.

Given that, I wouldn't suggest doing a new image altogether and I would be concerned if you threw the designer baby out with the bathwater; just get the type to play nicer with what's there already.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stef,
Just not to be missunderstood: I didn't mean you should change the main image (actually, my words were "it’s not necessarily a weakness"); the only thing I pointed is that I –and only I– had the sense of having seen the same image somewhere (probably in a locale brand), what made me feel uncomfortable a bit, but –once again–, that's just my troubled perception/long-term-memory.

Anyway, this is mainly a typographic design site, and one must realize from the beginning that all individual characters one could create are already created (since the 'A' to the '€'), which is to say, we work on signs that are arbitrary clichés by definition. I think the unique limit is given by self authenticiy, beyond which one falls in the deadly sin of <em>kitsch</em>.

Having said that, I beg you: throw away that hideous font, and you'll see how everything's gonna fit and work out.
