  body: "Agreed. The inline looks like Futura with a zero for the O (if indeed it
    is an O) and the outlining and shadow effect look hand drawn. \r\n\r\nThe only
    thing that springs to mind as slightly similar are the shadowed versions of Gill
    Sans.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/gill-sans/light-shadowed/]]\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/gill-sans/shadowed/]]\r\n"
