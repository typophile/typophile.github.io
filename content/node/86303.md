body: "hey guys was just wondering if anyone knew what the typeface the logo on the
  right is based on.\r\n\r\nWorking on an identity for a new client the logo on the
  right is their old logo, I need to know what typeface it is incase they want to
  keep it. The one on the right is the new one I have designed, any feedback would
  also be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
