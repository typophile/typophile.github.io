    the final one-sheets. This is a pretty striking and compelling design that really
    hints at the content of the film. But I\u2019ll bet a pitcher of Delerium Tremens
    that when this film is in theaters the one-sheet will just be the title, disclaimers,
    credits, and a few headshots poorly Photoshopped together. "

  body: "Tight-set Futura XB... stickin' to the classics, baby! (tho i don't like
    it quite so scaled horizontally).\r\n\r\nThe Happy-face/blood-drip icon is so
    good (& well-known), but i wonder if they're killing it by showing it so many
    new (CG) ways?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Don't like the text set on the building at all. Whole composition seems strange
    and off balance.

  body: "glad they're sticking with the classic yellow logotype from the book. brand
    loyalty !\r\nagree that the perspective type above seems off somehow. could have
    gone straight across the top.\r\n\r\ngenerally striking, though. as a fan of the
    book i'm looking forward to this. so far the visual identity of the movie looks
    very impressive, with some layouts matched faithfully from the original drawings.
    \r\n\r\nB+ for poster design, A- for brand identity."

    always think of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbg089yT31g\">North by
    Northwest</a>, to the detriment of what I'm looking at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: seeing this huge on banners at ComicCon reinforced how crummy the C looks
    when they eliminate the overshoot(s). In several versions of the logo, the bottom
    of the C awkwardly sits on the baseline and overall, the C appears smaller than
    the other letters. (the poster above notwithstanding)

    comic book.
