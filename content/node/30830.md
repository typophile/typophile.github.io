body: "this might be a very rookie question...\r\n\r\ni'm working with the 1000 em
  size. as with x-height and Cap height etc, is there overlap and underlap for optics
  within the em square, or does the absolute bottom of this em square equal the absolute
  bottom of where something like the descender of the lowercase y might dip -10 points
  below\r\n\r\nhope this makes sense...\r\n\r\n_will"

  body: "I think Will is not asking about overshoot as optical compensation, but rather
    whether you can have your ascender + descender extend beyond 1000. The answer
    is yes, you can. You can also, as you say, have your descenders actually go 10
    units below your specified 'descender line'. \r\n\r\nBut then you have to live
    with the consequences. These may be that your font will have descenders crashing
    into ascenders on the next line. Or ascenders or descenders that will be cut off
    and not appear on screen or in print. \r\n\r\nThese things depend on the application
    and what the user does. \r\n\r\nTo avoid problems, I believe that most fonts keep
    the ascender + descender 1000 or less, and the upper case diacritics below a line
    200 units above the ascender--as the usual default line gap is 20%.\r\n\r\nThis
    is just to stay out of trouble. \r\n\r\nAre you doing a script face? Others may
    give you fuller answers about script fonts, Arabic, etc., and when and how to
    violate what most fonts do. "

  body: "Thanks for the response. I've worked on a few a letters here and there in
    the past as display stuff for a quick job but now I find myself in the pits fighting
    with a full-on font and realize it's all new ground when it comes to the em square
    and sizing things correctly. needless to say I've already made a few fatal errors,
    but we learn from the mistakes and helpful friends on typophile.com\r\n\r\ni'm
    currently working on something of a rather bland text sans. as I've printed samples
    out thus far, I've realized it's not bland at all but that's hard to tell one
    letter at a time. \r\n\r\ntake a look. no critique desired. just take a friendly
    glance over my shoulder[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_6284.jpeg]"

  body: "David, on second thought, my response should have been: the question confuses
    me :)\r\n\r\nWill, when you say the em square what do you mean? The body size
    and so top and bottom of the em square as taken by InDesign would start at the
    top of the ascender line and go 1000 units below. \r\n\r\nIs that what you mean?
    If so, then overshoot and undershoot are not relevant to that. If you are referring
    to something else, then another anwer is in order, such as David's. If you are
    asking about overshoot for optical compensation, I believe most fonts would have
    more than what you show in your 'a'. Also the left side bearing would  not normally
    be smack against the loop of the a. Just open some fonts you admire that resemble
    yours, and check on what they do. "

  body: William, yes, I meant the top of the ascender to 1000 units below. my terminology
    is lack lustre. i apologize.
