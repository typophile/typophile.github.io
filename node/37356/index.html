<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>A friend has asked me to design business cards which I'm more than happy to do. Previously when I've printed it's been from large printing houses, and a couple hundred a pop.
My friend doesn't want to spend as much as a large printing house would charge, so can anyone suggest someplace I can get cheaper cards printed. They're only 2 colour and I've explained a cheaper place = lesser quality. I live in Toronto, but don't mind sending them out somewhere.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thermography is the way to go, one or two color. I think they look and feel better and more professional than flat cards.

<div class=commentbody>Haley,
I've had many friends that need a business card - fast. Our solution: I buy cover stock #110 from Staples. I run it through 10 up to a sheet on a 4/c laser printer (Okidata) and cut (well, I have a person who does superb, accurate xactoknife slits....)
If there is a bleed - then we use an 8-up format, so we can give (till it) bleed(s)...
They go home happy - and we are cheap, cheap, cheap.
And... yes, they look professionally printed and we receive many-a-smile.
Or... you could go to Popular Printing in NY - fast, reliable, not expensive. Here are their business card prices:
http://popularprinting.com/BC.html
P.S. Ricardo - I just did check out where you asked - and boy are they expensive
1 color 1 side 500 cards $170 (and maybe a 10% off) (and they don't even quote 4/c just 3/c 500 cards for $285)
Guys I use - 4 color 1 side UV coating applied 500 cards $39 bucks - no discount....</div>

<div class=commentbody>"No business cards" are better than "cheap quality cards". Thermography is cheap and rightfully so. Real cheap.
If you are skilled, one colour business cards, top quality paper, (Hand made perhaps,) letterpress which is suited for short run work, would improve your clients intentions.
One of the most important aspects of a designers obligations is consulting your clients. And I should add, will help build your "reputation". Not that that seems important in this day and age.

Jackie - I did my own personal business cards that way, only I cut them myself, but they turned out awesome. The look the same as the last set I sent out to a professional printing house.
I have a friend who owns a letterpress studio so maybe he has an easy way for cutting business cards already made. I'll look into it. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey, Jackie, thanks for that bit of info on pricing -- did not know that!
Haley, a cheap alternative I have found for my own business cards (and I've probably mentioned this in the other thread I linked to, above) is Avery Clean Edge Business Cards. 200 cards per pack, available for either laser or inkjet printers. Nary a rough edge in sight!

They really are a miracle of modern science, or technology: the sheet comes out of the printer, you fold it inwards along the edges of the cards, and you pop them out -- and presto! A co-worker saw them and told me that a few years ago these same Avery cards did have rough edges, and was surprised at the smoothness of the current ones.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ricardo - We use to use Avery's pre-cut paper - and guess what -- hubby does a better job cutting and it is much less expensive (I have a lot of friends.... lol ... that need instant cards.)
Also Giampa - we have used Popular Printing for many flyers and business cards - amazing, but their work is fine. This is my recommendation when money for a client really counts. Take it or leave it -- but it is very rare for me to make any recommendations, especially when it hinges on my reputation. Otherwise, for our high-end quality magazine, etc. we use a printer near Columbia, South Carolina. We've beat them up enough to give us the top of job we expect. Considering my husband has more than 50 years in the printing business, knows it inside out -- well, nevermind - to some of us quality still counts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A neat little trick for laser-printed business cards is to matt-laminate. This can improve the bulk & stiffness, and it also cuts out that nasty laser-toner shine.

<div class=commentbody>Thermography is only cool in an ironic way. If you can't pull off the irony, stay away.
If you're printing your own, go down to Kinkos, choose the highest thickness card stock that will go through the printers, and print a few sheets with crop marks. An xacto and a straight edge work fine for low-runs.

<div class=commentbody>Thermography is junk. It exists for people who are too cheap for engraving, and too dumb to know the difference. Avoid it at all costs.
The only person who ever did anything sharp with it was the late great Rick Tharp, who was good enough to pull off the irony. I think he used some random clipart from the Clipper, too.
