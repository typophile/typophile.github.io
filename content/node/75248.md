  developing some fonts, and i would like you to see my latest\r\ncreation called
  Vito Sans.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.resistenza.es/vitosans/\r\n\r\n\r\nthis typeface born
  during the summer of 2010, in a little town\r\ncalled San Vito lo Capo in Sicily.\r\nthis
  uppercase font is perfect for when you want to use eye-catching\r\nbig texts for
  anything from posters and flyers for concerts, events,\r\nparties, to cd covers,
  advertisements.\r\n<img src=\"http://www.resistenza.es/vitosans/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/vitosans_big.png\"

  body: "Vito Sans is very interesting, but the (lowercase?) /i/ in your first example
    could be easily confused for an /o/. The ring in the Aring glyph doesn't need
    to be touching. The tilde in your accented glyphs is also a bit wobbly. You might
    also try giving that ring in Aring and the cedilla a bit more weight. Especially
    the ring.\r\n\r\nNice though!"
