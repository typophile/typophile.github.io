body: Ladies and gentlemen, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a book project &#40;with a
  layout more akin to a magazine&#41; and am looking for a good sans-serif family
  that has a wide range of weights and also has small caps. I really like FF DIN and
  Griffith Gothic, but neither come with &#40;as far as I can tell&#41; small caps.
  Thesis, Myriad and Interstate are fine families, but have they become overused?
  Whitney has some potential... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve come to appreciate your input and
  expertise on these boards and look forward to your feedback.

    <BR>The above families have both lining and old style figures

  body: Meta has lovely caps. <BR> <BR>Avenir or Futura in small sizes and bold weights
    make for lovely &#34;fake&#34; small caps, but only if used all as &#34;lowercase&#34;
    caps.

  body: I can recommend Scala Sans, if you get the full package it comes with differerent
    combinations of figures &#40;lining or oldstyle&#41; with both U&amp;lc and SC
    fonts, which is great flexibility. The lining figures are full cap height.

  body: Thanks everyone for your comments. You are most helpful. Any concern to my
    other question that Thesis, Myriad and Interstate are overused? I love them dearly
    and they&#39;d all work perfectly, but they seem to be everywhere. Maybe it&#39;s
    just me.

  body: I agree. Go with something less ubiquitous and you&#39;ll stand out. <BR>Seria,
    Scala, Klavika, Legato are all good alternatives. My favorite <BR>of the moment
    is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&amp;searchstr=strada&amp;font_categories_checkbox=font_keyword_search&amp;x=34&amp;y=10"
