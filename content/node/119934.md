  body: "This is <strong>Aristotle Punk</strong> by Andrew Hart [2009-2013, free for
    personal use]\r\nKevin is right, it's a modified Avant Garde and it actually says
    so and credits Herb Lubalin in the copyright.\r\n\r\nYour sample is probably created
    using an older version [2009] and the text set is \"sUccess is a cHOice\":  <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1%20%2F%20%28Freemium%29&ffam=Aristotle%20Punk%20-%20Regular&fid=35b61ca8f8a1fcd8e4315c36eb05c527&fsize=60&text=sUccess%20is%20a%20cHOice&wrap=2|Aristotle
    Punk (2009)]]</strong>\r\nThe current version, which you can download from Dafont.com,
    is a bit different and you may need to flip the /C to match your sample: <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1%20%2F%20%28Freemium%29&ffam=Aristotle%20Punk%20-%20Regular&fid=482e3623172e6f35d95356ada3027405&fsize=60&text=sUCCess%20is%20a%20CHoICe&wrap=2|Aristotle
