<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I think I prefer the italic. It works a tiny bit better. In both the italic and the Roman the 'h' keeps jumping out at me (same as in the nasty 'Dwiggins Uncial thing'). He could have used a 'h' with an ascender. Not many words in English with 'h' and 'l' next to each other. It wouldn't have messed up his plans too much. <br>The 'f' and the 'g' are wonderful. <br>In terms of readability, though, I don't know. But then I'm not a very logical person and I don't like tomatoes. <br> <br>M.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha -- <br> <br>The only reproductions of the other uncial experiments that I'm aware of are two small photos in <i>American Proprietary Typefaces</i> published by the APHA (American Printing History Association). These images accompany John Kristensen's essay "The Experimental Types of W.A. Dwiggins." John runs the Firefly Press in Somerville and knew Dorothy Abbe. The extant materials pertaining to the uncials are in the Dwiggins Collection at the Boston Public Library. <br> <br>Tiffany -- the 264 and 264a materials are cataloged with the Winchester stuff, Folio Box N; the proofs that John reproduced are from folders 29 & 30, I think, in case that helps you find anything in your collection. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>J-F -- I also have a problem with the H, among other things. Here is something Dwiggins said at one point (this was in reference to the earlier uncial 264a, but he always did this H): <br> <br>"Damned interesting to see how easily you can take it, you swallow the D, B and G without thinking. P not bad -- better if the tail were longer. H is the only one that stops you -- and you'd get used to that." <br> <br>I don't happen to agree, but I thought it was interesting to see his thought on the matter.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant: <i>Making the connection from wooden figurines to subvisible type is all about intuition.</i> <br> <br>Okay, we have different definitions of intuition. In the case of the M-formula, I see a purely logical path, based on observation and experience, from the marionette to the typeface, as explained by Dwiggins in his own words. If this connection had been made by someone with only a passing knowledge of either marionette or type making, then I'd ascribe it to intuition. In the case of someone like Dwiggins, who was intimately and daily involved in the making of both marionettes and type, the connection might even seem to be an obvious one. Perhaps the lesson in this is that type designers benefit from having other hobbies. <br> <br>Re. Dwiggins uncial: one of its bastard children has to be 'FF Disturbance', even though I'm pretty sure that Jeremy Tankard had never seen Dwiggin's original when he designed Disturbance.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The M-formula as laid out in the document of July 3, 1937, is a typically engaging expression of WAD's ideas along these lines; but it was not a sudden epiphany on Dwiggins part. Neither was it formulated specifically in relation to newspaper designs, as one might infer from Unger's article. I have evidence of at least two earlier documents outlining some of the same ideas -- although neither of these specifically mentions marionettes. One of these, in fact, from February of the same year, is essentially a proto-M-formula. I haven't tracked down the drawings to see whether he put these ideas into practice before the July document. The application of the theory to small, newspaper types came about a year later. <br> <br>My point is that the M-formula is a culmination of thinking that WAD had been doing in this direction for about two years. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>With the idea of "where does intuition start and logic end" in regards to type design. I found this little ditty in my notes as well.

Hmmm... <br> <br>----- <br> <br>Book Fancier <br>-- Type <br> <br>Obviously, there is no reason for writing a thing if the <br>words are made up of characters that cannot be <br>deciphered.

No <br>concession that interferes with ease of reading can be <br>made either to beauty or to mechanical felicity. <br> <br>Legibility is the first law. <br> <br>The tests of legibility are use and survival. Laws governing <br>legibility may be deduced from a study of the characters <br>that have survived. Or may be evolved by experiment in the <br>laboratory. Knowledge from either source is deservable. <br> <br>Legibility being granted the question of excellence passes <br>into the domain of art. It happens in the case of <br>letterforms--that artisitic excellence and art are never very <br>far apart.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>To get back to Dwiggins and logic/intuition (after a very short nap). I think the most serious attack we can make on him in relation to the above experiment concerns the serious anachronism inherent in his perception of the Irish-English/semi-uncial as an essentially 'English' letter. I'm wondering what the level of scholarship was like on that sort of thing in the 1940s? What sources might he have been using? <br> <br>In the 8th and 9th centuries the 'English' he's talking about didn't exist yet. Letter frequency statistic are completely different for Old English and Modern English, so his theory about the suitability of semi-uncial is way off. On top of that, the letter forms he's talking about were developed for use in Latin texts and not English (or even Irish). <br> <br>But I love it anyway. To hell with logic. <br> <br>Matha.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, <i>Book Fancier</i> is a Dwiggins text that, as far as I know, was never published. It was probably never completed. It comprised a series of essays on the various elements of a book. I have a copy of the section on Design, which was used in the first setup proof of Eldorado. I've seen little bits from the section on Paper that were used in some test proofs of the second Falcon. <br> <br>I'd never come across this section on Type. This looks like it's an early draft (and seriously in need of an editor). Too bad you don't have a note on where you found it. I'm going to guess this was written sometime around 1942-44. <br> <br>The rest of this manuscript has been on my list of things to track down next time I can make it over to the collection in Boston. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I've seen the King's Fount, but I don't recall in what books it is shown (perhaps the brilliant and eclectic <i> Typographical Printing Surfaces</i>?). I think I recall Matthew Carter showing it in his talk on experimental type design at ATypI 94 in San Francisco. It is truly hideous, and also very difficult to read due to the almost complete absence of extenders. Basically, Ricketts took the view that all legibility was in the x-height ergo one could dispense with ascenders and descenders. It is, perhaps, an object lesson in the importance of the distinction between legibility and readability.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Aha! I may be mistaken in my memory of the King's type, and might be confusing it with another experiment of the same period. I've tracked down an illustration of a type by Ricketts that may, in fact, be the King's type, and it is not as I remembered it. It is still pretty horrid, but does not display the bloated x-height and truncated extenders that I must be remembering from something else. Unfortunately, the illustration is not captioned, so I can't be absolutely certain that this is the King's type, but it makes sense in the context of Dwiggin's comments. Also, the title of the work is The Kingis Quair. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7323.jpg alt="The King's Fount?"> <br> <br>Additionally, I found mention online that the King's Fount is shown in Goudy's <i>Typologia</i>, but I don't have my copy handy.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bloody Hell John, that was quick. <br> <br>Now that <i>is</i> interesting. Certainly worth the trouble. I think it works a bit better than the Dwiggins experiment, especially for this particular text. <br> <br>Matha</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is Electra available in digital form? That is such a killer font, but I only see it used in the <br>1940s and '50s. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually, Paul Nelson and Mamoun Sakkal did all the mark positioning for the Arabic Typsetting font. My contribution on that project consisted only of designing the Latin companion. <br> <br>What I'm working on now is a different and, thankfully, much simpler Arabic project.</div>
