body: "A fairly wide serif used as the main text face for <cite>Airman\u2019s Odyssey</cite>,
  a collection of works by Antoine de Saint-Exupe\u0301ry.  The book was published
  by Harcourt, Brace in 1942.  I've tried to represent a variety of characters in
  the main images; samples of the italic used are also included.  Thank you.\r\n"

  body: I'd say it bears a strong resemblance to <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=427294">Garamond
    Premier Pro</a>.  The only large difference I see is the capital "W".  But if
    I had to say, I'd definitely call this a Garamond of some flavour.

  body: Could have been a Granjon design. Someone will know that ital I though.

  body: "The W must be an important key, because most Garamonds have crossed legs
    in the W. In looking at the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" the Linotype
    Granjon seems very close and was available after 1930, and does have the same
    W and the large bowl of the 'g' like this sample. The only obvious difference
    I see is the 'R' in the ao2 sample, which extends past the baseline. The Granjon
    sample I have does not show this glyph in the set.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Look at the non-kerning f. Other distinctive shapes are R with short leg,
    lc italic g, wide t. Italic is loose, due to duplexing. \r\n\r\nIsn't this George
    Jones' Estienne for Linotype?"

  body: "Carl, you're right about Estienne -- we've had this several times before.
    It's the OTHER Garamond, and I keep forgetting it. This sample is from the Serif
    Font ID Guide, from a scan of a sample in McGrew's book.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/estienne_full_4412.gif]"

  body: Thank you for your insight (and the very helpful scan; I haven't even been
    able to find a sample online); it is revealed as Estienne.  (Apparently Estienne
    is not available in digital format, something which probably contributed a serious
    obstacle to my attempts at identification.)
