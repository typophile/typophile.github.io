  [[Ole Schafer|Ole Sch\xE4fer]] worked at MetaDesign as type designer and type director
  for Audi, Volkswagen, Boehringer Ingelheim, D\xFCsseldorf Airport, S\xE4chsische
  Zeitung, Berlin's public transport company BVG and others. His typeface for the
  City of Glasgow's festival of architecture made him known outside Germany. He was
  also involved in the extension of [[FontFont]] bestsellers [[FF Meta]] and [[FF
  Info]] as well as the new weights of [[ITC Officina]].\r\n\r\nSch\xE4fer now works
  as an independent type designer and teacher for type design and typography in Berlin.
  He launched his own foundry, primetype, in 2003 with new typefaces by himself and
  other designers.\r\n\r\nBesides Sch\xE4fer's work, primetype released fonts from
  other designers, including [[Andrea Tinnes]] and [[Verena Gerlach]].\r\n\r\n<strong>External
