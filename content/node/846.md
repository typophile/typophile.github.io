body: I am working on a logo for ACI International, formerly called the American Concrete
  Institute before its scope became global. It is a large, committee-based, 100-year-old,
  conservative, knowledge-generating organization that makes decisions by consensus.
  This logo is of one of those decisions.  <BR> <BR>The consensus is that they want
  to keep the globe from their old logo and that they want to incorporate a &#34;tagline&#34;
  into the logo. Also, many folks on the marketing committee &#40;and board&#41; like
  the longitude and latitude lines on the globe. Some suggested just adding a &#34;swish&#34;
  to the old logo in order to create a sense of dynamism. The idea of &#34;movement,&#34;
  therefore, seems important to them.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve uploaded the original logo
  and two versions of the new logo I&#39;d like to propose. <BR> <BR>I used Frutiger
  Bold for the logotype, and I added slab serifs to the I&#39;s because they didn&#39;t
  seem substial enough. Please tell me if I&#39;ve committed a typographic sin by
  doing so. I used Frutiger Extra Black Condensed for the tagline. One of my constraints
  is that I&#39;m limited by the fonts I have on my machine, unless I can demonstrate
  a compelling need to buy a new one. Please let me know if you think Frutiger is
  overused for a logo and, if so, what recommendations you might have. I also have
  Meta on my computer; I thought about that as another okay choice.  <BR> <BR>As for
  the logomark, I&#39;ve tried to incorporate some of the elements of the original
  globe, including the longitudinal and latitude lines. I thought that by having the
  blue-shaded part advancing past the midpoint, it maybe gave the impression of the
  dynamism they were looking for. Might be kind of contrived, though. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
  always the possibility that the committees will decide to keep the original logo
  &#40;or a &#34;very slightly tweaked&#34; version of it&#41;, but I&#39;d like to
  present them with the best alternative possible. Thanks for your input! <BR> <BR><img

  body: i definitely think what you have started is much better than the old logo.  i
    dont like everything being lowercase in the old one.  and the word international
    is the exact width of the globe, which i think looks wrong... the way you made
    the globe smaller than the words is way better. <BR> <BR>but i feel like the type
    has nothing to do with the globe image.  one small thing that bothers me is the
    square dot over the i .    I wish it were round.  also, i&#39;m not a fan of the
    two capital I&#39;s next to eachother.  i think you could play with that more.  maybe
    &#34;international&#34; can be all lower-case.   <BR> <BR>also, one thing i don&#39;t
    like about the globe is that its not divided in half.  the blue side gets a little
    more.  this could be interpreted as the &#34;ACI&#34; side having more power than
    the &#34;international&#34; side, which is not the right idea.  i know i&#39;m
    looking deep into it, but that&#39;s just a concern i have.  did u try dividing
    the globe in half?  i&#39;m not sure it would look better, but at least the globe
    would be cut in half.

  body: I think dividing the globe in half would make it look more static than it
    already is. Maybe you could drop the background color of of the globe and stylize
    the lines - make them more dynamic, and less symmetrical. I like the typographic
    treatment, but I agree with loren that the I&#39;s next to each other might need
    some alternatives. The globe just feels too heavy.

    his concrete knowledge on to his pupils. <BR> <BR>I think the type treatment is
    nice. Have you  tried splitting the I&#39;s and making a half blue, half concrete
    color I? This might not work, but the double I could be improved upon i think.
    <BR> <BR>Of your logo&#39;s, the tracking on #1&#39;s tag line I would tighten

    revisions now, but won&#39;t be able to finish them until tomorrow.  <BR> <BR>Loren:
    I agree about the i dots. I&#39;m changing that. As for the blue taking over the
    international side, I thought it might be a metaphor for ACI&#39;s concrete knowledge
    spreading around the world; I didn&#39;t think about other ways it could be interpreted.
    <BR> <BR>Garf: I tend to agree that the globe seems to overpower the type. I&#39;m
    trying to come up with some solutions, but am sort of stuck.   <BR> <BR>Andrew:
    You are correct. I was trying to achieve something heavy and solid, like concrete.
    My intuition is that if they choose a new logo, they will only be able to build
    consensus around a very conservative one. <BR> <BR>I re-read my original post,
    and I think what I said about it needing to be dynamic was misleading. Adding
    the swoosh to the old logo was one solution offered up by a committee member.
    I&#39;d like to present an alternative to that...one that, in subtle ways, conveys
    movement. I was hoping that the blue advancing around the globe did that.   <BR>
    <BR>Thanks again for the help--I will post samples again as soon as possible.'

    Nick, I didn&#39;t think your logo needed much work. The new condensed setting

    Besides, you lose the color to grayscale effect when its completely grayscale
    anyway. Have you worked with the logo in B/W? You might want to test it. <BR>

  body: i dont think the globe should have three different grays.  i like it better
    in just one blue and one gray.  also, did u try making the horizontal line thru
    the globe not just a straight line?  did u try making it wider in the middle and
    thinner at the sides?  it looks a little awkward because it doesn&#39;t wrap around
    the globe, it just goes right across it 2-dimensionally.  give it a shot; if its
    bad, i&#39;m sorry.

  body: David, no offense taken. I had the same thoughts myself. The globe is a generic
    symbol. And Frutiger is staid in this context, I think. <BR> <BR>The nature of
    the project, though, is that of a logo update. They are hesitant to change the
    old one too much. Like I said, they are very conservative. And I&#39;m afraid
    that anything other than a conservative solution would not make it through the
    consensus process. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m not sure that uniqueness is really necessary
    for their needs. The logo isn&#39;t meant for the general public. The audience
    works in the field of concrete--researchers, professors, contractors, builders,
    architects, etc. The logo will almost always be seen in the context of concrete
    by people who already know what ACI means. What the logomark will do, hopefully,
    is reinforce ACI&#39;s international nature as they take the organization global.
    <BR> <BR>Besides, I&#39;m wondering how much a logo really needs to communicate,
    intrinsically, about the organization it represents. I wonder if the logo takes
    on meaning by virtue of the organization its associated with. Take the logos for
    GM &#40;a generic blue rectangle with an underlined GM...could be anything&#41;
    or Visteon &#40;could be a telecom company or a business communications firm&#41;
    or Cingular &#40;could be a bank or a design firm&#41;. Through their associations
    the symbols acquire meaning. <BR> <BR>In any case, I appreciate your feedback.
    I still have time to work on other versions, and creating the most meaningful
    logo I can is important to me. <BR> <BR>N. <BR>

    the globe all together, or at least coming up with something more modern. I saw
    one that was almost exactly like this, except the color shift was right down the
    middle instead of off center like yours. The longitude/latitude globe logo is
    so cliche. &#40;It&#39;s like the father of the swoosh.&#41;

    time and through consistent use. <BR> <BR>The problem here is that the logo isn&#39;t
    terribly unique. <BR> <BR>That said, given the confines of design-by-committee-of-conservatives
