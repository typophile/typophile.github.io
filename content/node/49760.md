  Tonight.  Sorry for the tiny sample size, but I hope someone can point me in the
  right direction.  It seems generic enough to not be a custom face, but.. you never
  know.\r\n\r\nCleaned up the original image, which was a TV capture:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baseballtonightfont5_4684.png]"

  body: How odd. Is it a slab? Is it a sans? Is it slab sans?

  body: I don't know!  It's very quirky, hopefully I can get some more sample shots
    of it.. it's really a mix of slab and sans, but not exactly either.  It could
    be modified, but it looks so generic and clean.. it's just perplexing!

  body: "After grabbing a few more screen captures from tonight's show, there seems
    to be a fully-sans version, as well as a modified slab version.  Check these shots
    out, specifically the \"ACKS\" in both \"DIAMONDBACKS\" and \"JACKSON\".\r\n\r\nEach

  body: "It does look like Stratum, squished a little bit, and they added some serifs
    on the one version.. thanks, zevbiz!\r\n\r\n.. surprised it's not listed under
    \"Stratum Projects,\" as Baseball Tonight is a very popular ESPN show.."
