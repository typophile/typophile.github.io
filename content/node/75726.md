  Mac OS default installed sans serif font for text and headlines.\r\n\r\nIts for
  use in a word template that is going to be used by different departments, and i
  can't push them to invest in buying a font since there's to much departments involved
  and everybody wants something else therefore they decided to use a default font.\r\n\r\nI
  really don't want to use Arial, something with a bit of character would be nice\r\n\r\nthnx
  in advance for all the great help!"

  body: Depends which Windows you have; if you have Vista or above, there are the
    new cleartype fonts (Calibri, Cambria etc). If you're working onscreen, Georgia
    is very nice, and allround compatible (can be used for print as well). I think
    some systems have versions of Baskerville, Palatino or Garamond, but I don't know
    which versions.
