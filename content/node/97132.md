  a font make driving safer?</a></strong> \u2014 News release from http://www.fastcoexist.com/\r\n\r\nReimer,
  B., Mehler, B. Joseph F. & Coughlin, J. (2012). An evaluation of typeface design
  in a text-rich automotive user interface. <em>Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  AgeLab & New England University Transportation Center</em>.  \r\n\r\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\r\nThis
  paper reports on the results of a project examining the impact of typeface design
  on glance behavior away from the roadway when a driver interacts with a multi-line
  menu display designed to model a text-rich automotive human machine interface (HMI).
  Data from two studies are considered. Across the two studies, usable data was collected
  from 82 participants ranging from 36 to 75 years of age in a driving simulation
  experiment in which participants were asked to respond to a series of address, restaurant
  identification, and content search menus that were implemented using two different
  typeface designs. The second study served as a replication of the first with the
  sole exception that the brightness of the display screen was changed. Across the
  two studies, among men, a \u201Chumanist\u201D typeface resulted in a 10.6% lower
  visual demand as measured by total glance time as compared to the \u201Csquare grotesque\u201D
  typeface. Total response time and number of glances required to complete a response
  showed similar patterns. Interestingly, the impact of different typeface style was
  either more modest or not apparent for women on these variables. Error rates for
  both males and females were 3.1% less for the humanist typeface. This research suggests
  that optimizing typeface characteristics may be viewed as a simple and effective
  method of providing a significant reduction in interface demand and associated distractions.
  Future work will need to assess if other typeface characteristics can be tuned to
  provide further reductions in demand. "

    been self-evident to graphic designers for over 100 years, in fact it forms the
    basis of the profession.\r\nThis is where taste and experience come into play,
    because it\u2019s not possible to test every combination of every typographic
    variable, there are too many. Graphic designers can identify packages of values,
    settings that look right for page under consideration. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    not dashboards. I wouldn\u2019t consider it a contender, but am surprised it wasn\u2019t
    included regardless. And especially surprised that there were no serifs. AND,
    that there was no conflict of interest clause in this paper, given it was funded
    in part by Monotype. \r\n\r\nAs far as \u201C<em>Choosing an easy-to-read typeface
    will make text easier to read. That much has been self-evident to graphic designers
    for over 100 years</em>.\u201D Agree. But the key word there is <strong>self</strong>.
    What we have is anecdotal evidence, convention, aesthetics, and intuition. The
    little scientific research we have in this field with objective measures of human
    performance and empirical data is still very much in the early stages of its development.
    Its quality reflects this.\r\n\r\n@Ryan: \u201C<em>I have been trying to get a
    decent test for most legible for long text sans for a while now</em>\u2026\u201D
    And unless you drastically clarify and operationalize what you mean by \u201C<em>most
    legible for long text</em>\u201D you never will. The only way this paper got results
    was because they had clearly defined measures such as time, accuracy, and eye
    movements.\r\n\r\nYou may find some articles of interest in the literature section
    of my site. It\u2019s small, but I try add to it as I go.\r\n\r\nhttp://readthetype.com/literature/\r\n\r\nWhat
    you will most certainly find disappointing is that there is not a lot of research
    out there that looks at long passages of text. This is because, sadly, there are
    very few standardized reading comprehension tests with long passages. In fact,
    I can\u2019t think of a single on off the top of my head. A very common complaint
    in the field. I have tried to make up my own comprehension questions for long
    passages I selected myself, but it is amazingly difficult. They just end up measuring
    recall or visual search depending on your methods. I had no idea that writing
    your own comprehension questions was such a highly specialized skill.\r\n\r\nStill
    reading the paper, but it\u2019s 5:00 on Friday, and somewhere there\u2019s a
    pint with my name on it."

    was under development, Steve Jobs was adamant about minimizing the number of clicks

    my car's GPS sometimes requires 5 or 6 clicks to change destinations, which is
    a major distraction and seems like poor design."

    are studying is inherently flawed \u2013 in other applications the requirement
    (for fast word recognition) might not be the same and the effects might be different
    \u2013\_then it is a red herring.\r\n\r\nType-wise a heads-up display has significantly
    different environments to cope with and retinal implants are, obviously another
    kettle of herring.\r\n\r\nBut, as Nick mentioned, my point was to avoid the problem
    altogether. Is an lcd screen really required to operate a car efficiently? Could
    the systems be, for example, voice operated and the responses aural? I am not
    proposing that as the only solution, just as a thought. \r\n\r\nIt is surely obvious
    that if any device (vehicle) requires concentration to operate, with life and
    death consequences for distraction, using another device that holds \u201Ccrucial\u201D
    information (out of the operator\u2019s eyeline, or blocking it as in the image
    at the top of the article) is detrimental.\r\n\r\nWhether that information is
    actually crucial is another matter, of course.\r\n\r\nTim"

    With all due respect, i think you sketched a type popularity contest of almost
    no value.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's interesting about this study, as witlessed in this
    thread, the response is to misunderstand and connect the dashboards of vehicles,
    many of which used eurostyle, bank gothic and other squares for a specific and
    very good reason, with the navigation device in a study's simulator, which is
    used for a task totally different from that of a dashboard. \r\n\r\nAnd if the
    glance quality of a nav screen font is a safety issue, isn't the best font to
    text with during driving an outright emergency?"
