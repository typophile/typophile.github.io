  week and want to use this font for a t-shirt design. I tried whatthefont/identifont/etc
  but have had no luck.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in the font used for \"BOARD OF PUBLIC
  WORKS\".\r\n\r\nThe distinctive features are the extended foot of the R and the
  serpentine shape of the S. Hopefully one of you guys knows this on sight.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3461.jpg]\r\n\r\nMANY
  THANKS if you can solve this!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image001_4437.png]"

  body: The distinctive tail on the R tells me that it's an old ATF metal face called
    Card Gothic; I'm not aware of a digital version but, perhaps armed with the name,
    your search might prove more fruitful.

  body: "Nick-\r\nThanks for the input. So far my efforts to find this font have proven
    futile. It's hard to imagine with 10 jillion fonts out there there's not a digital
    version of this font, but it's yet to be found. Thanks to any others for their
    input!"

  body: 'Correction: I made this ID from memory. I double-checked the ATF 1923 Specimen
    Book, and the page heading was "Card Gothics"; this particular typeface is named
    Wedding Gothic...not that it changes anything, because I couldn''t find a digital
    version under that name, either.'
