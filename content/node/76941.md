  branding myself.  Please help me choose my new brand [[http://sqrd.net/images/l_a.png|logo]]!\r\n\r\nCustomer:
  my interaction design consulting company: sqrd.  Located in Silicon Valley with
  clients/projects focusing heavily on data visualization, so a little more on the
  geeky/mathy side.  \r\n\r\nLogo will be used almost exclusively online and on business
  cards.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nJulie"

  body: The letter spacing looks a bit uneven. I would try to shorten the r and drag
    the d slightly to the left. And then I maybe would drag the pair r and d to the
    left, but only a little bit.

  body: "In the first one, the q and d counters are too big.\r\nIn the other ones,
    as Arno said, the r should be modified to harmonise with the curve of d."

  body: "I think with a little concentration on balancing the counters with the other
    letters as mentioned would help but am troubled by the fact that to me this does
    little to reflect either data virtualization or 'geeky/maths'. \r\n\r\nIf I had
    to choose a design from the 3 featured I would choose the middle version, it has
    a fun touch with the red but without overdoing it. \r\n\r\nEdit: A bit of a gimicky
    suggestion but maybe extend the q to feature a tail, as in my example, suggesting
    the x and y axes of a graph?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img704.imageshack.us/img704/2226/sqrd.jpg\">\r\n"

  body: "Thank you all very much for all your responses.  And yes, Nick, it is Houschka!
    l love it dearly.  (Sort of star-struck now:)). \r\n\r\nRegarding theme, I don't
    think the logo itself has to reference anything math related.  The aesthetic feel
    of it just needs to err a bit on the left-brained side of neutral, since the clients/projects
    do (for now).  As apposed to, say, a logo for a company specializing in tv spots
    for children's programming, which might want to be friendlier.  \r\n\r\nName confusion:
    hasn't happened yet.  People are pretty used to weird spellings, and at present
    url typos don't resolve to anything troublesome.  \r\n\r\nPeople seem to prefer
    the thin version, overall, even though I don't feel it has enough ink in it to
    scale down well.  I've compromised with:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/l_e_6552.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think it solves some of the q/d counter problems.  Can't decide if the \"s\" is
    a smidge too far out, though."

    just embellishment or is there a meaning there?
