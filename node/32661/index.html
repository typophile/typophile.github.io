  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently preparing myself for building my own website (which still might take a while, mind you) &amp; I was thinking about putting useful information on it for graphic designers in general. One thing I wanted to do, is put a RGB/CMYK/Pantone (&amp; possibly RAL) conversion table on it &amp; also a list of fonts which are known under several names. I&rsquo;m thinking of retro fonts that have now been digitilized (eg. Jackson that is now available from Linotype as Laughin) &amp; also fonts that are cloned and widely spread over the internet. I&rsquo;ve often experienced (even at work) that we had font clones without even knowing it (eg. we had Arnold Bocklin, but also Horizon which -some kerning aside maybe- is basically the same). I had a few sites that mentioned font clones in my favourites list, but they no longer exist.
So if anyone knows of any fonts with several names, please let me know, I&rsquo;ll be sure to acknowledge you if I ever manage to get my site online ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That sounds like a great resource. On the color side, I was just trying to find something like that. When I couldn&rsquo;t find anything exactly like what I was looking for I started kicking around the idea of making a reference document, or website that would have RGB/CMYK/Pantone conversions as well as names that are associated with certain colors. That seems like it could really help with client communication because a designer could both use names the Client is more familiar with and look up color names that a client mentions.</p>
<p>Sorry if that&rsquo;s a little off topic,</p>

I used to have a few of those colour conversion sites amongst my favourites as well, but none of them were complete.

The only problem is that the internet is my only source &amp; that I will have to gather all the information myself, so if anyone here has links for fontclones, colour conversions or other ideas, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to post &lsquo;em here.</div>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The Bitstream Font Analogue (1992?) – which listed Bitstream fontnames against the respective standard industry names. This info may be on their website, but I&rsquo;ve never found it. They tend to rely on the &lsquo;family tree&rsquo; view on myfonts.com to provide names of equivalent faces from other foundries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Manual of Comparative Typography by Benjamin Bauermeister, 1988, Van Nostrand Reinhold, N.Y. lists many alternative names from other photosetting suppliers for quite a few of the standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(Shameless plug!) some of the above information made it into the &lsquo;see also&rsquo; sections of the individual font pages at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my site about the so-called top 100<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So for example, if you look for Akzidenz Grotesk there you&rsquo;ll see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;See also;
Amsterdam Mercator, Bauer Venus, Stempel Reform Grotesk, Haas Normal Grotesk, Bauer Folio, Linotype Basic Commercial, BT Gothic 725.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
&hellip;and so on. In this particular listing I can say that only the last two are AG under other names from different foundries. Generally, I leave it to the viewer to decide which typefaces are simply close in design and which are rip-off.</p>
<p>I think Daniel Will Harris has something on this at his site too; try starting at <a href="http://www.will-harris.com/esperfonto/">http://www.will-harris.com/esperfonto/</a></p>
