body: okay, so i guess it is possible to cut and paste outlines from illustrator to
  FontLab, but i&#39;m just wondering can one somehow do the same thing with paths
  from photoshop? If so, how?

  body: 'Here&#39;s how I get from photoshop to fontlab at the correct scale: <BR>
    <BR>1. Scan a fat wad of glyphs. <BR>2. Fiddle with magic wand settings <BR>3.
    Fiddle with make work path settings <BR>4. Export paths to illustrator. <BR>5.
    Open in illustrator. <BR>6. Make a compound path <BR>7. Fill black <BR>8. Scale
    up &#40;or down&#41; until one glyph take up approx 2/3rds of a letter page <BR>9.
    Save as EPS v.6 <BR>10. Open FLAB :-&#41; <BR>11. Go to your glyph. <BR>12. Import
    glph from EPS &#40;you can do about 15 or so at a time&#41; <BR>13. Once you have
    the right basline, and scale cut and paste to the right glyphs <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;
    Take a break for Lunch &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>14. Now that you know the exact
    scale for your em square, export one of the new glyphs to EPS. <BR>15. Open that
    back in Illustrator. <BR>16. Scale the remaining glyphs to match. <BR>17. Repeat
    the import to FLAB with the remaining glyphs. <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Have a
    break for Dinner &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>18. Buy <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/27933.html?1079165244"
    target="_blank">ScanFont</a> &#40;scroll down for Thomas&#39; helpful info&#41;
    for FontLab. <BR>19. Reduce it one step :-&#41; <BR> <BR>There&#39;s probably
    a faster way, but I&#39;d guess ScanFont is worth the 99 bucks if you do it a
    lot! <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: 'and there goes the weekend huh? ;^&#41; <BR>just one problem... i don&#39;t
    have illustrator. <BR>i was wondering if i could somehow copy my vector paths
    and paste them directly into FontLab, more out of curiosity than anything. very
    interesting to see someone else&#39;s method. <BR>here&#39;s my current method:
    <BR>1 scan glyphs <BR>2 run &#39;em through streamline <BR>3 import em into the
    old demo verison of FLab &#40;the eps won&#39;t work with the new version for
    some reason&#41; <BR>4 copy &#39;em from the old version and paste &#39;em into
    the new. <BR>and all before lunch! <BR>and then comes the cleanup process which
    for me has been taking several months! ha ha <BR>maybe i should look into what
    scanfont is all about, hmm?'

  body: If you have FreeHand 10 or 11 &#40;MX&#41; you can open the .ai file generated
    by Photoshop, with your vector data, scale it accordingly, and copy it direcly
    in FontLab cells using the &#34;paste special&#34; command of FreeHand with &#34;eps&#34;
    as the selected option. In FreeHand there&#39;s a nice &#34;simplify&#34; command
    to clean up paths, while Illustrator has another handy command to inversely &#34;add&#34;
    points for further vector manipulation.
