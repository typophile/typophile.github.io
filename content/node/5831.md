  body: Well, &#34;NET WT. 1.76 OZ&#34; is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/goudy/old-style/testdrive.html?s=NET%2BWT.%2B1.76%2BOZ&amp;p=48">Goudy
    Oldstyle</a>, but beyond that, I think most of the package is hand-lettered --
    &#34;ALTOIDS&#34; is almost certainly custom lettering. <BR> <BR>&#34;CURIOUSLY
    STRONG PEPPERMINTS&#34; is definitely hand-lettered &#40;three different P&#39;s,
    two different S&#39;s, probably more inconsistencies than that&#41;, but Letterhead&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/downloads/index.shtml">LHF Full Block</a>
    is a similar style, and it&#39;s free! <BR> <BR>&#34;The Original Celebrated&#34;
    is also probably hand-lettered -- the face that this reminds me the most of is
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/windsor/">Windsor</a>... if you
    tweaked one of the weights of Windsor and added some strokes, you could probably
    get very close. <BR> <BR>&#34;MADE IN BRITAIN&#34;, of course, is Helvetica Medium,
    maybe Bold. =&#41;
