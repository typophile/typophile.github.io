  <BR>&#40;sorry article in Danish.&#41; <BR>This is what they plan for the harbour
  in the city I work in. I like typographic shapes as much as the next typophile,
  but this is just plain ugly. The city counsel likes the idea because it says the
  name of the city, jeez.

    or explain how that &#34;Vejle&#34; thing is supposed to be created? Two dimensional
    or three? Is it made out of tin foil? <BR>'

    have to look at them every day.  It would be easy to give someone directions to
    your apartment...
