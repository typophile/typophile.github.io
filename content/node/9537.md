  will allow me to change a vector file of a full alphabet that i have created in
  Adobe Illustrator 10 into a true type font. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

    href="http://www.fontlab.net">http://www.fontlab.com</a> &#41; should do the trick
    for you. ScanFont 4 will open an EPS/AI file and automatically separate the letters
    into separate glyphs, and export it to TypeTool 2, which you can use to build
    the TrueType font. There&#39;s a ScanFont&#43;TypeTool pack for Mac for $199:  <BR><a

    <BR>Of course, you can choose to get FontLab 4.6 instead of TypeTool 2, but that
    would be much more expensive <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: John <BR>Years ago Chank posted this on his site at  <BR><a href="http://www.chank.com/howto/index.php"
    target="_blank">http://www.chank.com/howto/index.php</a> <BR>these are instructions
    on how to make a font and makes use of Fontographer, Photoshop and Illustrator.
    You could do the same with Type Tool 2 and Scan Font, but you will get the idea
    of how to do things from Chank. A bit wacky, but he started a lot of stuff which
    people still look at.
