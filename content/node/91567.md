body: Hi, I am an Art Director that came into a company after another Graphic Artist/Webmaster
  left.  The past person designed a logo over 9 years ago using this font. The original
  font file is no longer on my PC because that old PC died. Tried to upload the font
  to WhatTheFont.com and came out empty handed. I really believe it is a font and
  not a font treatment. Please help, because I now have to revisit that logo and update
  what it says. I can recreate the look, but it would be preferable to obtain the
  font if possible. Thank you.

      100th year last year and the original PGA tournament was held here. Thanks for
      the help.
