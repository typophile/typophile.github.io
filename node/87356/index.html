Dezcom, I think what you mean is that let's say someone hires you to create an ultra-thin version of say Baskerville, (providing that Baskerville's EULA allows for modification as long as the font is not resold) and you do this for the client to use on their publication, but they can't sell the font to anyone, and you can't sell the font to anyone either. You may not even be able to use it yourself? But you can do a custom font of it and show pictures of it on your website as an example of your custom font design services. 

Is this what you mean?

But now let's say that Baskerville's EULA has a clause in it that says absolutely no modification of any type is allowed (is this really enforceable by law though? I mean really) then you can't do it, or at least you are not supposed to do it. What can they do to you anyway though? I'll bet you couldn't really be sued, right?

You could always draw it from scratch to harmonize with the existing design.

U.S. courts have determined that click-through agreements carry the same weight as standard contracts; consequently, yes—if you violate the EULA, you <em>can</em> be sued, and you won't have a legal leg to stand on. Whether or not the injured party thinks the benefits of filing suit outweigh the costs is another matter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So if a client asks you guys to take a font they like and make it thinner or italic or whatever style you can think of, but that font's EULA doesn't allow modifications of any kind, do you do it?

@J.Montalbano - I guess you're saying that if you draw your own version of it from scratch that's different from taking their font and using their control points, kerning and other font data, and using a filter in FontLab or whatever software does this the best to create a new style from that font. That makes perfect sense, but even if you draw it from scratch, can they claim that you still stole their design and sue you for it, even if you are only licensing the font to that one client and it never leaves their office or yours? BTW I am only wondering in case a client asks me to do this for them, not because I am looking to do it. I think in my situation, I could talk the client into choosing a different font to modify that does have a EULA that allows for modification. I am terrified of breaking the law.</div>

But I guess I was thinking of say a painting or illustration and not a font which is software with font data that is protected. I always thought that if you changed someone else's work say at least 30 percent (isn't there a copyright law that states an exact percentage) it became a new work that belonged to you. Then again there's a gray area there and fonts are different because they are software and the data that they contain is also protected.</div>

Holy smokes. Okay now I'm scared of that situation.

I thought of one solution, you could always contact the people who license the font you want to modify before you start, and ask their permission. Worst case scenario they say no.</div>

No. I don't. I tell them to contact the original designer for the mods. If they get permission from the original designer to have the mods done by someone like me then I will consider taking the job. I have to say that this type of work might have been more attractive to me earlier in my career, but I tend to stay away from it now.</div>

To me it is all about respecting the EULA’s that go with fonts. It does not matter whether the end user (or you) consider certain limitations reasonable or not. If one does not agree with the EULA, one should not purchase the font in question and buy one which comes with a more suitable license from another foundry. 

People in the font business should by deﬁnition <strong>completely</strong> respect the conditions deﬁned by the rightful owner(s) of font data and design, <em>even</em> if the latter part is not protected by law in certain countries. 

This forum is public and in my opinion one really has to think twice before stating that to a certain extent and under certain conditions end users or third parties are basically allowed to infringe EULA’s.

It's not about a lack of respect for type designers (it's significant here that I am one). In a way it's about respecting the fact that no type design is created in a vacuum; that all type designs belong, in at least a small way (and sometimes in a big way) to society.

And for the record, the no-mod clause is the only clause I have a problem with.

Sometimes the original designers want to make the modifications personally, sometimes they want to charge a supplemental fee for this additional permission, sometimes they just give permission. I've never encountered a designer who simply said 'No' when asked about modifications.

I don't see anything unreasonable about a clause that obliges people to contact the original designer if they want to have a modified version of a font, and it is indeed about lack of respect for the original designer if one just goes ahead without permission. </div>

And I think that if the client is adamant about using that particular font that has a no mod clause attached to it, they will have to pay the original designer this supplemental fee. If you explain to the client the legal implications of not doing so, they should understand, especially if they have respect for your expertise.</div>

It's exactly the sort of legal small-print that decent people unavoidably overlook all the time, only to become entrapped later on.

I think fewer foundries would put a no-mod clause if more potential customers actually read their EULA...

		<div class="commentbody">By and large, people are reasonable.

Last year I encountered a situation where a font was being used for headings and subheads in a project that was very special to me. I was really unhappy with the spacing (and kerning) of the font, and thought it could be fixed. I volunteered to do so, contacted the designer and copyright holder of the font, and they were quite amenable to me going off and doing my thing. If I recall correctly, I licensed a copy of the font to have it to work with, and delivered my modified font to both the user and back to the designer.

Now, it was *way* more work than made any sense, but I achieved what I wanted.</div>

<blockquote>But now let's say that Baskerville's EULA has a clause in it that says absolutely no modification of any type is allowed (is this really enforceable by law though? I mean really) then you can't do it, or at least you are not supposed to do it. What can they do to you anyway though? I'll bet you couldn't really be sued, right?</blockquote>

You could always draw it from scratch to harmonize with the existing design.

And don't be so sure legal action cannot be successfully taken against infringers of EULAs.

James, what kind of people would waste time stalking Ryan on the off chance they can catch him red-handed violating their no-mod clause, and then drag him to court? To me all that stuff (and maybe your post too?) is just scare tactics. And fear actually doesn't do well in the long term, and doesn't do well on Typophile from what I've seen. BTW, Hoefler and Licko were two font designers who used to be very gung-ho about suing people, but they ended up giving up. Bruisable egos do not make for good business.

Ryan, you've actually nicely alluded to an interesting paradox: modifying a font is (usually) illegal, but making your own copy of a font design is not! At least not in the US. The thing is, do you think a font house would rather sell a font to somebody who will modify it, or not only not sell the font but have a no-strings-attached (and probably free) clone of it floating around!  :-/

To me it's all about treating people with reasonableness, and taking personal responsibility, instead of using lawyers to manipulate people's emotions or riding rough-shod over people's <em>reasonable</em> expectations.

BTW, even though I personally do not respect no-mod clauses, I don't take on commissions that involve violating that clause, and this is because: I don't feel like I can guarantee my own "no leaks" clause; and the client could one day decide to incriminate me. However I do try to encourage others to not fall for scare tactics, and any fonts I license myself I feel free to modify as it suits me (while making sure my files are secure). A sort-of-related example: when making Trajic notRoman* I took the liberty of directly using Adobe Trajan's outlines, but to every one of the dozens of people who over the years contacted me to purchase it, I said No.

> Worst case scenario they say no.

Best case scenario: tell them you refuse to buy their fonts because of the no-mod clause, and even though you know it's just a scare tactic. Communicate clearly that you are not consumerist livestock.

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, so I've hit a situation where I've tried to follow best practice as closely as possible. 
The typeface my client really wants to use has a no-mods clause attached. 
I've contacted the designer and tried to give them as much information as possible regarding usage and what modifications we would make.
I offered to hire a designer they recommended to make the alterations.
I have tried to be as amenable and accommodating as possible (within commercial constraints).
Still getting little traction on allowing modifications to their tyepface.

If the designer says No (contrary to comments on this post) is there anything else that can be done other than find another typeface to use instead?</div>
