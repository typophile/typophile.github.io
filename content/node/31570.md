  body: "I don't think you'll find any digital fonts that will match any of these
    signs and labels, but there are some that get close.\r\n\r\n1. Several different
    styles are shown here. Some of the wider letters are similar to <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PRC.118813.0.0\">Stratum</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11521.0.0\">FF Oxide</a>.
    The narrower: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=MSF.118752.0.0\">Refrigerator</a>,

  body: Number one appears to be a variant of the typeface which was used on U.S.
    highway signs before the advent of the Interstate Highway system. Later this month,
    I will be releasing two versions -- regular and condensed -- under the name Route
    66.
