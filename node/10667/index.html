It is a good boilerplate NDA, and will give you some idea of the kind of things that you need to specify in any such agreement. <i>NB: you should have any legal agreement reviewed by a lawyer in your own jurisdiction (or that of the counter-signing party).</i> Note also that you should exchange two copies for signing, one to keep in your own records and one for the other party to keep. Do not disclose any confidential information to the other party until you have a counter-signed copy of the agreement.  <BR>  <BR>If drafting an agreement specifically to cover submission of a design to a foundry, you might also want to include explicit prohibition against derivative works, although this is implicitly covered in the prohibition against 'disclosing, reproducing, summarising and/or distributing  <BR>Confidential Information' and by the assertion that 'the Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied rights to the Receiving Party.' <BR> <BR>[Note that I've disabled printing of this PDF, but you can copy and paste the text.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I’m not convinced that an NDA, in the way I understand them, is super helpful here. Say you sign an NDA with a foundry, send them your fonts, you exchange some emails but at the end of the day they say they’re not interested, or you can’t agree to terms. Later they come out with a design eerily similar to your design. In signing an NDA you can’t disclose the communications you had with them without being in breach of the NDA yourself. And as it’s notoriously difficult to prove cloning you might find yourself on the wrong end of the law. Maybe.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What Simon said.
The only thing that might work is depositing your design with a neutral third-party in advance, and if they copy your idea you can shame them after the fact (on Typophile). You might even tell the foundry you&rsquo;ve done this (although I imagine it might scare them off). Say it&rsquo;s not personal - it&rsquo;s your &ldquo;standard protocol&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Just do not forget to NOT open it when it arrives on your doorstep and keep it in a safe place.</p>
