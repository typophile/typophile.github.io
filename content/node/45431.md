  to the development of letterforms and the evolution of typography. An example might
  include a good image of the Rosetta Stone or a sample of cuneiform or possibly a
  high res image from the Book of Kells. These would only be used for teaching purposes

    even have an image collection [[http://www.bmimages.com/]] You can find pretty
    much everything writing-related in there. Not sure about the price you'll have
    to pay though. Maybe if you explain they're to be used only for teaching you can
    get them really cheap or even free? Although I doubt the latter.\r\n\r\nGood luck! "

  body: Artstor is a truly extraordinary source. Your college library should be able
    to set you up with a free account, and with that, you can easily create very high
    quality prints and/or slide shows. I used to work in a college library, and even
    our most art-wonky professors were impressed with Artstor. (http://www.artstor.org)

  body: A unique source of high quality reproductions of virtually every possible
    letter form from the times of Roman empire till the beginning of the 20th century
    is the czech book "Krasne pismo" (~Beatuful Type) by Frantisek Muzika. It is a
    2vol book, the two volumes together are about 15cm thick with thousands of reproductions,
    perfectly chosen to illustrate various type evolution stages (most of the images
    show letters magnified to show every possible detail that may be of interest to
    serious typographers). It is written in Czech, but the reproductions are so valuable
    that it has gained some popularity even among people who can not read it. I've
    heard from some of my american friends that they have invested the effort to obtain
    it just for the images, that may be difficult to get elsewhere. The book was written
    in early sixties, but remains (I believe) one of key resources of its kind. Try
    abebook.com to get it. Or, there exists a cheaper recent re-issue available, e.g.,
    at http://www.paseka.cz/?produkt=145, or at any bigger bookstore in Prague.

  body: "I would think the first step in developing the content is to define those
    key touchstones. The Book of Kells and the Rosetta Stone, nice work as they are,
    are really nowhere along the line of key developments in type or typography.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Are you saying that Victor Hammer was wasting his time with a lifelong obsession
    of Uncial? Just because Rolling Stone doesn't use it does not negate its validity.
    And noone can ignore that the development of type was not influenced by tool and
    surface, Rosetta Stone or The Trajan Caps. Type is a recent development in the
    span of communication and its development. To ignore even one example of a cave
    wall, clay tablet, or manuscript forms is ludicrous. The world did not begin with
    Sans!\r\n\r\nFor different reasons they are both significant!!!\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "I try to show examples that people might already have some general familiarity
    with. So I talk about stone carving and show an image of Trajan's column. And
    how one of the reasons we have serifs is that the stone carver was trying to enter
    the stone gracefully with his chisel without cracking it. Trajan's column connects
    literally to the font that bares its name which can be found on many computers
    today. My thought is that if I can move from something known to something unknown
    the audience can make the connections more quickly. \r\n\r\nThe current points
    of interest I use include:\r\ncuneiform as my earliest example\r\nphoenician wine
    trade to cause dissemination of alphabet\r\nquill, sumi brush, chisel influenced
    the shape of letterforms\r\npapermaking in china\r\ntrajan\r\nbook of kells, scribes
    and manuscripts\r\ngutenberg - book faces\r\nindustrial revolution - Display faces\r\nWWII
    - rationalism, bauhaus\r\nSummer of Love - psychedelia\r\nAdvent of computer -
    digital faces\r\n\r\nI would love other ideas. The goal is that the participant
    will come away with the impression that typography/letterforms are dynamically
    woven into the fabric of life. How we are all interconnected is a key theme in
    my talk.\r\n\r\nLance Kagey, Beautiful Angle."
