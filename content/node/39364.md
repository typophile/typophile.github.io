    the reader free to read in between the lines, plus you can consider how print
    designers differ from the web.\r\n"

  body: I struggle question with this every day. Both as a font seller and user. So
    much of how typography effects readers depends on the subject and design and the
    literacy (cultural) of the reader.

    exactly our reason for a typeface choice is not very high unless the target audience
    \ is the design/typography crowd. That does not mean our loves' labours are lost,
    it just means audiences can't verbalize intangible effects.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    more on the legibility of the typefaces or their expressive qualities?  I would
    presume that for the web our choices are much more limited and detrimental to
