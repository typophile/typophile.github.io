  Developer Toolkit to install on my newly reformatted machine and I'm having a problem...\r\n\r\nOne
  of the most useful Fontlab Macros that it came with was the CheckOutlines macro,
  but not I guess the FDK doesn't come with it, only as an osx tool.\r\n\r\nWould
  anyone who happens to have this macro be willing to share it with me?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJosh"

    the file is still there and the path is the same.\r\n"

    it is there as support to my font apps. I think the script in question needs to
    be in the path I mentioned above for it to work.\r\n\r\nYou may have had another
    script by the same name from another source. I don't find one by that name supplied
    by FontLab."

    folder needs to be placed into your FontLab folder just as it is; don't move anything
    out of the FDK folder. Then run the file \"finishinstall\".\r\n\r\nRestart your
    FontLab app and it should work."

    now but when I get home I'll try moving the FDK folder into the Fontlab folder.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    just to be extra sure, when you say \"The FDK folder needs to be placed into your
    FontLab folder\" do you mean place it inside the folder...\r\n\r\nLibrary/Application
    Support/Fontlab     \r\nor\r\nLibrary/Application Support/Fontlab/Studio 5\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJosh"

  body: "Man, this is really frustrating, haha.\r\n\r\nIn the past, the FDK installed
    the checkOutlines macro INTO Fontlab, not as a separate python script that needs
    to be run on its own. Now when I install it, I get a handfull of other Macro sets
    in Fontlab (Anchors, Hinting, Kerning, MM Designs, Contributed, Effects, Export),
    but nothing that contains the checkOutlines script.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind humoring
    me, what steps do you go through to actually run the scripts within the Tools/SharedData/FDKScripts
    folder? Maybe I am just going about it in the wrong way?\r\n\r\nthanks again for
    all your help, I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAlso, are you on Fontlab 5.1 ? Maybe
    i'm having trouble with some sort of incompatibility since I've already updated?"

  body: Comparing the contents of the latest FDK-25-MAC.zip (58807) to one from 2009
    (21898), there seem to be far fewer FontLab macros in Tools/FontLab/Macros, including
    everything in the Outlines folder, which previously had the Outline Check macro
    and a bunch of others. (The python scripts in Tools/SharedData/FDKScripts aren't
    FontLab macros.)

  body: "FontLab Studio 5.1.3 here.\r\n\r\nI have a FontLab Folder in my Applications
    folder which I think is a remnant from version 4, but that's where the FDK is.
    In both my application support folders there is FontLab stuff too, put there I
    presume during an install of something since I have four or five of their apps
    -- plus this machine has been through four or five upgrades of differing versions
    of OS X over time. Even with all the other stuff, the FDK is still in Applications>FontLab
    Studio. The latest version of 5.x.x installs the app outside of that folder which
    is why I say it is a remnant.\r\n\r\nIf you run the finishinstallOSX program that
    is contained in the FDK folder it sets the environment path to the FDK so very
    likely you can put it wherever you want it just as long as you run that little
    program after you move it. Also, in the FontLab folder in the FDK Tools folder
    is another program to run to install the macros into FontLab -- which it appears
    you have already done.\r\n\r\nAs for the CheckOutlines.py script, it is accessible
    from within Python with all the other third-party scripts. Select \"Outlines\"
    in the first scripts dropdown, then choose \"Outline Check\" in the second; it
    is the one to run. It runs then writes a log file and shows the path to the log
    file.\r\n\r\nThese things get kind of frustrating sometimes, don't they?   :-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Josh, bear in mind if you load those old scripts from 21898, don't overwrite
    any new ones because there have been many bug fixes. Also, some of the scripts
    may have been integrated into Studio, and some may not work due to changes in
    Studio.\r\n\r\nJust sayin'.   :-)"

  body: "George, the problem is mentioned in the previous post by gargoyle . Basically,
    the most recent release is missing a lot of the third-party macros that were present
    in the previous releases of the FDK.\r\n\r\nFor me, there is no \"Outlines\" choice
    in the first drop down, it installs a handful of other tools, but I guess they
    don't actually include any of Outlines scripts as macros anymore...\r\n\r\nIf
    you or anyone is willing to upload the Outlines macros folder for me (and maybe
    the other macros folders the FDK use to install), I would be very grateful! Let
    me know if you need my email address or maybe you could just temporary upload
    it to a site like wetransfer.com or something.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nJosh"
