body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis subject has been discussed several times here and
  my self already had problems with this and posted the problem. I think is time to
  look at the problem and figure out what to do to solve it.\r\nI try to edit a forum
  post in order to attach a pdf file.\r\nI do the \u201CEdit\u201D and open the \u201CFile
  attachments\u201D.\r\n\u201CAttach new file\u201D and \u201CAttach\u201D. The file
  is show in the list and selected in \u201CList\u201D.\r\nDo the \u201CSubmit\u201D
  and the file disapear and dont show on the post!\r\nThis problem is in both Firefox
  and IE...\r\nI have just installed the \"last\" flash player in case someone tries
  the \"download the last version of....and try again!\"\r\n\r\nWhy is the upload
  of a simple file directly connected with flash? Is this really necessary? Wich software
  is used for this forum?Opensource or developed especially for this purpose (typophile
  I mean...)?\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca"

    first.
