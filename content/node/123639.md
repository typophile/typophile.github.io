  key-pad will have to be reproduced separately.\r\n\r\nThis keyboard was made before
  the days of \"computer fonts\" and the font may have been created by Apple just
  for this keyboard. I am looking for the closest I can get - Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Keyboard_4598.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Keypad_4317.jpg]"
