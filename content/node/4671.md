  body: 'Thank you for the link to Genitum...I had noticed it before and thought that
    it looked very interesting and complete, but I was concerned that it was not postscript.
    I always feel a little leary of TrueType... <BR> <BR>I have also found the following
    fonts for IPA: <BR> <BR>Newton from Paratype <BR>&#60;<a href="http://www.paratype.com/welcome_e.htm"
