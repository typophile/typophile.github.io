  little?\r\n\r\nOne of our clients at Smidswater need to buy an OT version of Helvetica
  with the characters for ALL european languages.\r\nWe need also a good set of versions.\r\n\r\nThe
  Linotype versions I had the opportunity to check support only Latin1, cyrilic and
  some extra accents, but not all the necessary for Central European texts.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nRamiro Espinoza.\r\nramiro.espinoza@smidswater.nl"

    the OpenType \"Com\" versions of the regular <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/526/helvetica-family.html\">Helvetica</a>,
    which has a more styles, they include support for 48 European languages (basically
    everything used in Europe except Greek or the languages that use Cyrillic\u2026
    ALL CE languages are supported). \r\n\r\nYou can see which styles have OT format
    fonts available by looking at the font format icons on each font display: there
    is one for OT that uses the familiar round O OpenType icon.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/16454/48languagessupportedinopentypecomfonts-doc.html\">Here
    is a list of those languages.</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1266/neuehelvetica-family.html\">Neue
    Helvetica</a> has OpenType \"Com\" fonts as well. Or you can by \"Pro\" versions
    of Neue Helvetica. These are a little cheaper because they support less languages
    (just the Pro languages\u2026 <a href=http://www.linotype.com/16453/33languagessupportedinopentypeprofonts-doc.html\">here
    is a list of them</a>\u2026 it is shorter than Com but it still includes all of
    the CE languages).\r\n\r\nNote that there is a package of all 51 Neue Helvetica
    fonts available in OT format for $749. These are just \"Pro\" fonts, though. Not
    \"Com\" fonts. \r\n\r\nUnfortuantely the only OT Helveticas that have all the
    CE fonts plus Greek and Cyrillic in them are the four Helvetica World styles.
    Sorry :("
