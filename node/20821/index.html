<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>"To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master." – Milton Glaser
"Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's a good design for a bus." – David Hockney
"Both optimists and pessimists contribute to our society. The optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute." – Gil Stern
"Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose." – Charles Eames
"It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see." – Henry David Thoreau
"In art the hand can never execute anything higher than the heart can inspire." – Ralph Waldo Emerson
"Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen." – Leonardo da Vinci
"The visual image is a kind of tripwire for the emotions." – Diane Ackerman
"Designers can create normalcy out of chaos; they can clearly communicate ideas through the organising and manipulating of words and pictures." – Jeffery Veen
"Design is in everything we make, but it’s also between those things. It's a mix of craft, science, storytelling, propaganda, and philosophy." – Erik Adigard
"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools." – Douglas Adams
"Life beats down and crushes the soul and art reminds you that you have one." – Stella Adler
"Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes." – D. H. Lawrence
"Delay always breeds danger; and to protract a great design is often to ruin it." – Miguel de Cervantes
"There is always a heavy demand for fresh mediocrity. In every generation the least cultivated taste has the largest appetite." – Paul Gauguin
"Design, in its broadest sense, is the enabler of the digital era - it's a process that creates order out of chaos, that renders technology usable to business. Design means being good, not just looking good." – Clement Mok</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Jesse,
sorry about the loss of your data, but i am afraid you won't find much sympathy with this kind of request here.
<cite>I’m trying to replenish cool textures, vector sets, fonts, basically anything that’s beautiful and useful.
Please don’t hesitate to hit me up with any juicy links or if you want to send me anything directly, please feel free.</cite>
This just sounds "arrrgh, Pirate" to me. If you purchased licenses for your fonts etc you shouldn't have a problem in getting new copies. But hey, maybe you are a good guy and i am just paranoid...
