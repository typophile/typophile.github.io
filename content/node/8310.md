  body: I&#39;m sure it is a very wonderful thing, and I&#39;m sure that all the latest
    bells and whistles are invaluable. <BR> <BR>But I think I&#39;m just as suprised
    that Adobe don&#39;t offer a stripped down version as well as the 19.8MB&#40;26.8
    with the &#34;Adobe Yahoo! Toolbar&#34; and &#34;Photoshop Album&#34;&#41; download.

  body: They packaged two pro fonts with it?  wow,  that&#39;s a little surprising,  I
    guess they&#39;re trying to make Myriad the new Arial.

    They could do a lot more to make it happen if that <BR>were their goal. I would
    certainly welcome it.

    4. <BR> <BR>Every release since 4.0 has been bigger, slower and more bloated with
    creeping featuritis to the point of disfunction. Meh, indeed. Do yourself a favor...
    download version 7, install the free fonts and turf the rest. <BR> <BR>Humbug.'

    <BR> <BR>One strange bug is that that the font named Minion Regular that you&#39;ll
    find there is in fact Myriad.

    The font is the right one with the Windows version.'

    didn&#39;t load photos in the file but they opened in 7.

  body: Please note version 7 requires, at least according to the download page, Windows
    2000 SP2 or higher. So, it isn&#39;t available for those of us with only a legacy
    to stand on. For those who use version 6, also note the download is actually 6.0.1.
    It&#39;s good to know that, because update 6.0.2 says 6.0.1 must be installed
    first, and the download file &#40;full version&#41; is called AdbeRdr60_enu_full.
    Also note there is an update 6.0.3, too. ;&#41;

  body: There is nothing wrong with Reader 3 or 4 except font rendering. <BR> <BR>&#40;Those
    complaining about speed of recent versions should perhaps learn to weild the delete
    button in the plug-ins directory.&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh, and those included fonts are
    very nice. Freetype renders them quite well; I even switched to Myriad Pro as
    my system font under Linux.
