  body: 'Love it!  <BR> <BR>One thing that bothers me is the swirl on the S...I find
    it to be really distracting. Maybe try tucking it into the lower curve of the
    S.  <BR> <BR>The w and the E &#40;at the end of switchblade&#41; seem a tad heavy
    in relation to the other letters. '

  body: I really really ,,, really like this. I can see how Kyle finds the &#39;s&#39;
    distracting. My first instinct would be to move &#39;Romance&#39; to the right
    where it would fit into that nook at the end. Hope you don&#39;t mind I couldn&#39;t
    help myself.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6730.gif"

  body: Yes, very well done PC. <BR> <BR>And tiffany, I was gonna do &#42;exactly&#42;
    what you did to eliminate that &#34;dead white&#34; space. Another option is to
    put it all on one line. <BR> <BR> Maybe the &#39;D&#39; on blade could be extended
    or be a bit bigger. It might look good sharpened. <BR> <BR>The junction at the
    lower left of the B could be sharpened too, like the M and N in Romance. <BR>
    <BR>agree with kyle about the Es. Maybe the E in switchblade could be a tad smaller.
    <BR> <BR>nice custom work. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: I agree that the Switchblade E should be smaller. <BR> <BR>My main problem
    is with the R, cause i first read PLOMANCE, :-&#40; <BR> <BR>Yes I know its silly
    but is the first thing i read <BR> <BR>Maybe the leg of the R should cross a little
    bit to the right and be more expresive and less vertical like the S in Swichblade.

  body: I liked the dead white space as opposed to of centered diagonal reading. <BR>
    <BR>thought the white space made a good growl...like the type was a mouth and
    space was the mouth. <BR> <BR>oo I need sleep
