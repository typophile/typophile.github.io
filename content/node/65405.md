  and I need to know what font Apple uses for buttons in Mac OSX. I don't know whether
  it's the same font as used in title-bars etc. in Mac OSX, but I just need the one
  from the buttons ;).\r\n\r\nIn case someone's reading this thread and doesn't have
  a Mac, here's a screenshot: http://www.robinkanters.nl/macosx-buttons.png\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\nRobin Kanters"
