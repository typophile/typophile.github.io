  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">as a creative director, it&rsquo;s an understood that we have to justify to the client, nearly every design decision&ndash; especially why <strong>stringent use of typography is an undebatable must</strong>. but, for whatever reason, they are unwilling to allow a design agency to apply their professional thinking without a fight.  the client however, on the flip side, will not allow anyone else to downplay their &lsquo;professionalism&rsquo; in what they do. it&rsquo;s a circle in which i have yet to find reason.  continue to butt heads until they finally see the light i guess&ndash; i&rsquo;m not really sure what else to say.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i believe it was jean paul sartre who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;hell is clients&rdquo;</p>
<p>just kidding.</p>
<p>i think there are a lot of reasons for this.</p>
<p>1/ they are generally paying a good deal of money, for which they
are somehow responsible (their job or the success of the company)</p>
<p>2/ design has an inherently subjective component, so there will 
always be room for debate (as opposed to other professional 
relationships, e.g. if my construction manager tells me i need a
certain kind of concrete to carry the load, i am unlikely to argue)</p>
<p>3/ design - especially with the advent of DTP - always feels 
somewhat &ldquo;graspable&rdquo; by clients, i.e. the feeling that they can
do it themselves  - it&rsquo;s often difficult to quantify the value of
our experience, expertise, and intuition.</p>
<p>sometimes i think about finding a small, oceanfront town in italy
where there is an old man who builds boats by hand and has no
apprentice because no one wants to do it anymore. i&rsquo;d become his
apprentice and make wooden boats by hand and drink a lot of wine.</p>
<p>then i wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with clients anymore. ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Where did I recently read that all designers want—not fame or fortune—is to be respected.</p>
<p>If someone comes to us for design, we expect them to treat us as any they would any specialist and to know that what decisions we make are in their best interest and also that of the design.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a fickle mistress, this imaginary boundary. The one between doing what is right for the design and fighting for it to all ends or doing what the client wants and turning a blind eye to what isn&rsquo;t appropriate for the design. Some designers are graced with the ability to make the client believe that they&rsquo;re making all the decisions, but in reality the designer is making all the decisions. Alas, we aren&rsquo;t all blessed with this soothsayer talent.</p>
<p>I feel your pain.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There&rsquo;s usually 2 issues:</p>
<p>What the client wants vs. What they need</p>
<p>To resolve this, I think there are 3 necessary roles:</p>
<p>The designer
The client
The person that can communicate between the two</p>
<p>From experience, I think that 3rd role is the key, and is often what is missing. For better or worse, that role is often best played by a person with good &lsquo;sales&rsquo; personality.</p>
