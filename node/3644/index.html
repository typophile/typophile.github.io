<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>My first *proper* sans-serif. I have been labouring through the night, driven by a surge of adrenalin brought about by a university acceptance. So here it is... Dent ... at least most of teh characters. s,u,v,w,x,y,z are still to be done in lc. no uc have yet been done. Am I doing everything wrong here? It is basically a fusion of gill, verdana and others. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2877.gif alt=dent> <br> <br>Matthew</div>

<div class=commentbody> Hi matthew <br> <br>a good start i would say... <br>Look at the 'c', the width of the bowl is bigger than the bowl of the 'd'. Is it the same stem-width as the. <br> <br>The horizontal stem of the 'f' and 't' is to short in my opinion. BTW: the angel of the 't' down-stroke and the 'f' up-stroke looks very different to the others round shapes. (dont need to be the same... maybe it is only my own flavor) <br> <br>The 'n' needed a little improvement at the left stem. <br> <br>'d' where the bowl go in to the stem looks round at the punch but linear a the outside (hope you understand what i mean) <br> <br>The 'm' is to small <br> <br>okay hope this helps a little <br> <br>Greetings Jens </div>

<div class=commentbody> Very nice start. Reminds me a lot of Bernhardt (Agfa) or Bernhard (Font Company). I think overall your spacing is a little tight. (Although you probably aren't addressing spacing just yet.) I agree with the remarks made by Jens overall. It looks as if you are designing a monolinear design, but I think the main vertical strokes on all the characters (which have them) would benefit from a little modulation. I'm interested to see your version of UC for this style of face. Post soon? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Jens... having not benefited from an eductaion in typography of any kind, your remarks at first were slightly confusing. But it doesn't take a genius to decipher most of what you say. <br>>Look at the 'c', the width of the bowl is bigger than the bowl of the 'd' <br> <br>yup, noticed that. have corrected. <br>>The horizontal stem of the 'f' and 't' is to short in my opinion <br> <br>I was unduly influenced by a common newspaper font in England here. You are right. <br> <br>>BTW: the angel of the 't' down-stroke <br> <br>Am I right in thinking you meant to say "angle"? <br> <br>anyway, will fix the 'm' and 'n'. I can see what you mean about the 'd' in the gif, but in fontographer it seems OK. strange. <br> <br>anyway, here is the font so far.. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2879.gif alt=blit> <br> <br>m still needs work, as does s</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hoppla angle yes you are right! Im sorry! I form germany... <br> <br>lets go on: :-) <br>'m' and 's' you saw by yourself... but look where the bowl meet the stem and compare/make it similar to the 'n' (the same to the 'r'). The 's' seems to be mirrored. You can do this I guess but I would try to do something like this: <br>(simulation) <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2884.gif alt=2xs.gif> <br> <br>The width of 'v', 'x' and 'z' is to big, inverse the 'w' is to small. <br>Flavor: the middle stroke of the w maybe have to go up to the x-height <br> <br>The horizontal line of the 'e' need improvement. Also the 'down'bowl as not smooth <br> <br>BTW: Please dont care about the typography name I make, maybe they are wrong.. <br> <br>Greetings Jens <br>BTW: wich university is it where you will go? And wich 'course'?</div>

<div class=commentbody> thank you - the 's' helps a lot - ignorant of basic type composition I am. I will correct the other letters. <br> <br>Cambridge University, doing Computer Science. <br> <br>Thanks for the help <br> <br>Matthew </div>

<div class=commentbody> > Cambridge University, doing Computer Science. <br> <br>Heavy. <br> <br>The font: my main problem is that many of the curves have "wobbly" contours; like in the bowl of the "b", the top is heavy, the right way too light, and the bottom a little too light. Compare with the "c", which is mostly solid, but much darker too. Also, make the "m" like the "n". <br> <br>hhp </div>
