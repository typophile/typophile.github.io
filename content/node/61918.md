body: "  I don't make text fonts. Almost all of my work is POP displays, signs, banners,
  t-shirts, and posters. The fonts I build are exclusively for these media. To this
  end, I've never hinted a font. But, Fontlab has auto hinting, which I've never really
  considered turning off (best to leave sleeping dogs lyso to speak.) Is there any
  underlying problems with killing the auto hinting and go hintless? The hints are
  not generally a problem. But, it can be a little distracting to work on a layout
  with the client looking on and your font looks funky on screen. They also turn crazy
  if embedded in pdfs. Converting to paths solves the problem, but that can get annoying.
  So, to hint or not to hint?\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    is not very good, and can distort outlines when printing on laser printers. Just
    learn how to set up your blue value and stem weights and hint your fonts with
    the auto hinter that Adobe so graciously provides us in the AFDKO. It\u2019s easy,
    only takes a few minutes, makes the fonts look pretty good, and they can even
    be converted to TrueType hinting with a Fontlab action."
