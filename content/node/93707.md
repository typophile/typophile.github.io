body: "Looking for a font I've seen before. A venetian slightly slabbed in it's serifs.
  Very much like Emigre's Vendetta, but not as calligraphic. Of course when I Google
  \"classic slab serif\" I get everything from Clarendon to Lubalin Graph. This has
  a very classic look.\r\n\r\nAttached is a crude sketch, but shows the slab, somewhere
  between a classic serif and a slab.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3512_4202.JPG]"
