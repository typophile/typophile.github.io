  a blog he kept as part of an art/research project on the culture/dynamics of his
  suburb a while back.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to not produce a finished, bound book, but
  to display a stacks of individual pages (up to 200) on a long bench in a gallery
  space, for people to collect, assemble, and take home their own copy.\r\n\r\n(<a
  href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/bilateral/519319338/in/set-72157600285523082/\">Here
  are some photos from a previous showing of the project</a>, in which the blog was
  just copied, unstyled, into an MS Word doc)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any similar
  projects (insofar as adapting online content to print)? I haven't sat down to plan
  this out properly, but issues of how to deal with hyperlinks, post metadata, comments
  etc immediately come to mind.\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know if it might be possible
  to convince a book printer to deliver stacks of unbound pages instead of finished
  bound copies?"

    and workflow are optimized so pages collate sequentially. A book printer can do
    what you want, but it won't save you any time or money.\r\n\r\nIf you're printing
    1000 or fewer of each page, and the pages don't require high-quality color or
    subtle halftones, any reliable copy shop can do the job.\r\n\r\nIf you want the
    pages to look like keepsakes rather than lecture notes, specify an off-white sheet
    with a soft finish instead of the copy shop's default paper.\r\n\r\nTrying to
    replicate the hyperlinks on the printed page seems contrary to the spirit of the
    enterprise. Is the original blog still accessible somewhere, so folks can have
    the full-on interactive experience if they like what they read on paper? If so,
    you can ignore the hyperlinks and give them the URL of the blog, maybe as a footer
    on the printed pages. "

    looks quite interesting \u2013 pity it's all sold out!\r\n\r\nThe friend in question,
    it turns out, has essentially unlimited access to a two-colour RISO machine, and
    likes the aesthetic, so it looks like everything will be produced on that. It's
    a small-ish (sub-1000) run."
