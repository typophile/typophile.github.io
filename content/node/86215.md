body: "Can anyone assist with some online references (scans of books are fine if that's
  what's available) regarding the Latin scribal abbreviations and typographic breviographs
  of the 16th to 18th C.?  I have found references for the scribal abbreviations of
  the early medieval period, though not particularly detailed ones, and the typographic
  usages in the 16th C. were very significant and not always the same at all.  For
  example the use of a macron over a terminal u to signify um or a symbol similar
  to a q; to indicate que.\r\n\r\nFor an example of the types of works, see the scan
  on the right for this page of [[http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pagina:De_Nobilitate_et_Praecellentia_Foeminei_Sexus,_Agrippa,_1529.djvu/26|Heinrich
  Agrippa's De Nobilitate et Praecellentia Foeminei Sexus]] or the same with respect
  to this page from [[http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Pagina:Utopia,_More,_1518.djvu/67|Thomas
  More's Vtopia]]\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to find a reference that goes into great
  detail as to all the variations.  In a pinch I'd take titles of books I might be
  able to find through a brick and mortar library or even order online, but I expect
  there are references that just aren't coming up in my searches.\r\n\r\nEnglish references
  would be preferable, but German or French would be better than nothing.\r\n\r\nGru\xDF,\r\nDoug"

  body: "The standard work for palaeographic document study is Adriano Cappelli's
    <em>Dizianario di Abbreviature Latine et Italiane</em> and, for English documents,
    <em>The Record Interpreter</em> by Charles Trice-Martin. But these both deal with
    manuscript abbreviations, rather than typographic, and are illustrated by written
    forms.\r\n\r\nThere is an electronic reference, based on Cappelli, if I recall
    correctly, but expanded and using blackletter type. It is called <a href=\"http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophy/projects/abbreviationes/index.html\">Abbreviationes</a>.
    It used to be available as a Mac app, but now seems to be in more formats. There
    is a license fee."

  body: You may also want to look into the MUFI character recommendation [[http://www.mufi.info/specs/|available
    online here]]. It deals with many Latin abbreviations in typography. MUFI was
    responsible for encoding a number of them in the A720-block of the Unicode standard.
