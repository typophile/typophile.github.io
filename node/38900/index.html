<p>Paul, with all due respect, I think that was a bad move on your part. Not just because I happen to have contributed to the discussion and now feel that it was time down the drain, but also because if everyone starts erasing their posts on whim this place will become too chaotic for my taste.</p>
<p>I have the most respect for this site&rsquo;s moderators, but please next time use the powers that were entrusted to you a little more carefully. Thanks.</p>

<p>Just because we can do it doesn&rsquo;t mean we should. I don&rsquo;t think I need to remind you that Typophile&rsquo;s biggest assets are its users and their contributions. If those disappear this webcommunity will completely loose its meaning of existence.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what others think but I actually find that quite annoying. If people are not sure if they want their posts to remain available, they should abstain themselves from contributing to the discussions.</p>
<p>BTW, this reminds me of a claimed bug where posts that are edited move to the bottom of the thread. To me that&rsquo;s a feature rather than a bug, and I think it should remain that way. This will held users more accountable of their actions.</p>

<p>I beg to differ, Miguel. On the type ID board it was common practice to make the ID and then go back and insert the link. Now we find ourselves adding the link into an additional post, which is extra work for everyone (poster and reader) and falsely moves you up in &ldquo;Prolific Posters&rdquo;. I also sometimes reread my posts and feel I could have worded something more elegantly. Or maybe I said something I wish I hadn&rsquo;t said. I think to then have the edited post slip to the bottom is a bad idea, since it can make the responses confusing. I&rsquo;d rather see the edits be somehow visible, so that others can see what was edited, rather than messing around with the order.</p>

<p>I know, and in several occasions I didn&rsquo;t get first place because I always spent the time confirming the ID and looking up all the information to provide along with it :-( So, moving to the bottom upon adding the missing information is just fair ;-P</p>

<p>You can always post again clarifying everything up. I feel that&rsquo;s the right way to do it, as that&rsquo;s what happens in real life. I mean, we all have our bad moments where we say things we shouldn&rsquo;t, but do we go around everyone&rsquo;s head and edit or delete their memories?</p>
<p>This is just my view, of course. I guess that online I abide to the same rules as I do in real life, instead of becoming a different (virtual) persona.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m sure you try to be the same person online that you are in life, but i don&rsquo;t think anyone can ever really do this. i mean, are you the person you are to your friends, to your family, to your colleagues, to strangers?</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to liken a discussion board to a real discussion. In some ways they&rsquo;re the same but in some ways they&rsquo;re completely different. For one, a discussion board discussion can (hypothetically) exist forever and anyone who wants to join it can. discussions don&rsquo;t work this way in real life, therefore participants in an online discussion have incentive to present themselves and their ideas in the best light possible.</p>
<p>You feel (if i understand correctly) that once something is written, it should be forever. I don&rsquo;t feel that way. I don&rsquo;t mind that you have the original discussion opener in your mind, as you &ldquo;contributed&rdquo; to the original discussion. However, i think that if i can rephrase myself to make myself better understood by newcomers to the discussion, it is desirable to do so. i have edited myself several times writing this post, i don&rsquo;t see why i should have to stop doing so once i have pressed the &ldquo;post comment&rdquo; button, if i feel that i can further clarify my intentions.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m human. i make mistakes. i should be able to correct them if i have a chance. i&rsquo;ve made every effort to act ethically in this instance and throughout my interactions here on typophile. if you disagree with my actions, you&rsquo;re entitled to your opinion.</p>

<p>Yes, pretty much. Online I don&rsquo;t attempt to be something I&rsquo;m not in real life. For me it&rsquo;s much harder to pretend than to be myself, and that applies to pretty much everything I do.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>

<p><em>However, i think that if i can rephrase myself to make myself better understood by newcomers to the discussion, it is desirable to do so.</em></p>

<p>Absolutely. And you can always do that in a new post, can&rsquo;t you? Adding a new post not only makes the discussion richer, IMO, but also avoids the risk of making a post downstream somewhat nonsense. That&rsquo;s why I think that kicking an edited post to the bottom of the thread is a safer and better option.</p>
<p>BTW, am I right to believe that when moderators edit posts they don&rsquo;t get misplaced?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree. Sometimes it helps to clarify what a thread is meant to be about to change the title or it&rsquo;s body text. Obviously it can be a slippery slope but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wise to make a blanket statement. This is inevitably going to be a grey question requiring judgment - which will fail sometimes.</p>
<p>I do agree with Miguel that when in doubt it is probably best not to change things because of the violence it does to the clarity of ideas being exchanged. I have definitely seen some threads here where the narrative became muck as a result of edits &amp; retractions. I wasn&rsquo;t happy about that. I would like to have the opportunity to make up my own mind. Also what he said about<cite> &lsquo;only makes the discussion richer&rsquo; </cite>and his point that in most cases clarity can be established as part of the flow rather than by re-writing a post, struck me as particularly pertinent and insightful.</p>
<p>However all this talk about pretending and real life though strikes me as a little bit too much like unasked for armchair psychoanalysis. I would leave that out.</p>

<p>To me that sounds very illogical. Discussions get very confusing because of it, since for example a post with an answer or reply end up <em>above</em> the post they were an answer or reply to. It almost becomes randomized; very inconvenient for a proper discussion.</p>
<p>The same goes for the suggestion that edits become bold or colored. That would render the ability to set something in bold yourself useless. Also posts will look like candybars with edits in color and attract unnecessary attention to themselves, looking chaotic.</p>
<p>If you want to somehow show that a post was edited: add an automatic sentence in a smaller pointsize saying the post was edited plus the date and the time. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Correct. Edits should be seen as edits and in the hierarchy of things, fit below the original content. This creates an additional troublesome problem with long data however, when both the original and edit are long (and dissimilar from one another). I think that&rsquo;s why this problem is so often deliberately ignored. Some existing solutions that generally work out a little better are: to only give the author of a comment the ability to add a brief editorial correction in addition to the original (that is marked as such or so understood); Allow unlimited editing under the clearly marked disclaimer &lsquo;This content has been modified&rsquo; (eBay); Or allow a brief time window for editing, after which your only option (regarding that specific comment) is &lsquo;delete&rsquo; (Facebook); To run a &lsquo;diff&rsquo; on the two comments, and to display the original—placing footnotes that correct it. That last one&rsquo;s hairy, and all of these are kind of under the assumption that the purpose of editing is to correct mistakes, rather than the full range of things one who edits may purpose to do (change mind, rewrite).
But it&rsquo;s a computer, and we&rsquo;ve come to expect the tools we use to be somewhat silent and obedient. After rewriting several sentences, I don&rsquo;t want a computer telling me, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re changing your mind? You must be. This data looks nothing like what was here before you clicked <em>edit</em>. Maybe you&rsquo;re just changing your tone after reading how poorly you got your point across on the first try. Either way, that&rsquo;s what my <em>rewrite comment</em> button is for. You should have clicked that one. If that&rsquo;s what you meant to click, I can arrange something…&rdquo;</div>

<p>Nick: I Agree, most of the edits I do are fixes of strange sentence-breaks created by the board interface, which were not there in the comment formatting field (that happens basically all the time, so a automatically added notice saying &lsquo;edited at time/date&rsquo; would be unnecessary for such edits).</p>

<p>A bug that has been there for more than 18 weeks becomes a problem. I&rsquo;d like to understand the nature of the bug. I have no idea how posts are ordered. The timestamp of an edited post must change, since it is used to determine when a font was identified. If posts are ordered according to their timestamp, then edited posts must be moved to the end. Again, if ordering is determined by a date, the date of the first post must also be kept if we want posts not to be moved to the end; as a consequence, at least two dates must be kept for each post: that of the first post, and that of the last edit. Why then not keep at least those two posts? This would allow comparing the first post with the last edit, and I would feel better after editing a post because I never tell what I changed (usually typos, sometimes I add a few words because sometimes I tend to be cryptic).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is a good example of the community policing itself. Paul did a no-no and the community has called him on it. I don&rsquo;t feel a need to reprimand Paul in a private email, since I know him well enough to know he only has the best intentions. And I hope Paul knows me well enough to take my light but public rap on his knuckles the right way. =)</p>
<p>So this community (and the moderators) know, the policy is that Typophile NEVER deletes posts. In rare cases we have unpublished them &ndash; this can happen when matters fall into legal territory that puts the viability of Typophile in a compromising position. In every case those unpublished threads still exist in the content system.</p>
<p>So, to that point James, if you&rsquo;re calling out threads that seem to have gone missing now is the time for the moderator(s) to make things right or provide a compelling reason back to the community as to the reason for unpublishing something.</p>
