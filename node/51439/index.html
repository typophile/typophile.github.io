  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking around the forums, and don&rsquo;t see a place specifically set aside to discuss the Typophile web site itself. Although the Typophile site is maintained by Punchcut, I can&rsquo;t find any reference as to whom one should address questions/concerns about the site.</p>
<p>Is the preference to include such topics in the &ldquo;General Discussions&rdquo; forum? Would it make sense to have a separate &ldquo;Typophile Web Site&rdquo; topic in the &ldquo;Special Interests&rdquo; forum?</p>
<p>The sort of posts that I&rsquo;m thinking about would be items such as the following:</p>
<p>Single Open Quotes: When using a single open quote in a comment, the &ldquo;SmartyPants&rdquo; function always returns a single close quote that looks like this: &lsquo;This is the wrong quote opening quote mark.&rsquo; It is possible to get around this by embedding a HTML tag for a single open quote, but in a web site full of fussy, fussy typographers and type designers (fussy in a good way), shouldn&rsquo;t this be fixed?</p>
<p>On the opening page of the Typophiles site, there is a summary of postings titled &ldquo;Handpicked,&rdquo; which until today I have assumed was an accurate title. However, today the first listing in this category is: &ldquo;Technorati Profile (ignore this post, to be deleted),&rdquo; &ndash; so it would appear that the items listed are in fact NOT handpicked, but somehow machine generated. Should the title of this listing be changed to more accurately reflect how the posting are chosen?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Clinton,</p>
<p>at the very bottom of the pages, there is a link asking for feedback:
<a href="http://www.typophile.com/contact">http://www.typophile.com/contact</a></p>
<p>For discussing typophile bugs and (missing/desired) features in public, I guess it is just fine to start a thread like this in the general section.</p>
<p>AFAIK, the Handpicked section is handpicked indeed. The thread to be ignored was published by [[Joseph Pemberton|Joe Pemberton]], who is one of the founding partners both of Punchcut and Typophile. Hence I assume he is just testing something.</p>
<p>For the ‘single quotes’: how do you input them?</p>
<p>F</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry I missed the contact link at the bottom of the page. I wonder if it&rsquo;s just me, or do others also often miss stuff shown only at the very bottom of a web page? I would prefer a link higher on the page (perhaps at the very top along with the other options) &ndash; but I agree, it&rsquo;s my fault for not scrolling down all the way.</p>
<p>Thanks for the confirmation that the items listed in the Handpicked section are, in fact, handpicked. I guess I still don&rsquo;t understand why that particular item would have been picked to appear there &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>For single quotes, I simply use the apostrophe key for both opening and closing single quotes. I know that there are specific key combinations that can be used to specify a single opening (and closing) quote, but many programs, such as MS Word, generally have no problem translating the apostrophe mark correctly when converting to them &ldquo;smart quotes.&rdquo; SmartyPants manages to convert double quotes correctly &ndash; but for some reason doesn&rsquo;t handle single opening quotes well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, the opening quote has been the wrong one for a long time now. I think since the last redesign of the site/forum. Not really important, but kinda ironic for a website about (good) typography. ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Clint - thanks for your feedback. You are welcome to send us an email using the Feedback link, and of course there is always the forums to discuss these issues. We, at Typophile, may not always participate in the threads, but we are listening and are actively addressing issues like this that arise.</p>
<p><cite>Thanks for the confirmation that the items listed in the Handpicked section are, in fact, handpicked. I guess I still don’t understand why that particular item would have been picked to appear there — but it’s not a big deal.</cite></p>
<p>As Florian said, the the &ldquo;handpicked&rdquo; list is actually handpicked. We use it as a way to surface topics we find interesting that may not be getting a lot of visibility otherwise. As for the Technorati thread, honestly I have no idea what that is about. I think Joe must be doing some sort of experiment. :)</p>
