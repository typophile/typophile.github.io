  a visual journalism student at Northwestern University. For one of my classes I'm
  writing an paper about contemporary gravestone typography. I've seen the thread
  here with the man who was soliciting help with a relative's tombstone design, but
  the paper is a bit too broad for his case.\r\n\r\nWould anyone be willing to chat
  on the phone or email/point me in promising directions? I'm just looking for ideas
  about what makes (or you think would make) a good face for stone, special cases
  of gravestone typography or really anything you guys know or would be willing to
  speak about on the topic.\r\n\r\nThe paper is due Monday, so hopefully I can speak
  with some of you within the next few days. I've included my contact information
  here and of course we can use this thread, too.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGus\r\n\r\n847.280.1705\r\ngwezerek@gmail.com"

    a time schedule, but, at least I am willing to help with one remark: if it is
    gravestones it is not typography. It\u2019s epigraphy, or lettering.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    have you considered a walk across the local graveyard next to you?"

  body: 'Haha! I have. I''ve actually surveyed and mapped the graveyard down the block.
    Most of the tombstones were from the late 1800s, though. I''m going to go to a
    more recent one today where I can find contemporary tombstones. Thanks for the
    lingo tip, though : )'
