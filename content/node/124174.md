    body: Thank you fvilanakis, but the O might be different.  I will check to see
      if there are variations of Habana.  However, you have given me a great direction.  Thanks
      again.

  body: The font has so many distinct letters (|M|N|A|) that is high improbable to
    find a similar having the correct |O|. Chances are that the designer removed the
    central spot of |O|.
