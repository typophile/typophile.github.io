  S&M street fair, the 'Folsom Street' fair as subject. \r\n\r\nAnyone know a good
  solid display face that in your opinion could be tweaked for these purposes? \r\n\r\nI'd
  rather work with some more known faces, then tweak them to my own ends...\r\n\r\nHere's
  the current mark as it stands. \r\n\r\nany thoughts are appreciated..."

  body: "Do you want to follow the style of the mark (it reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.smeltery.net/fonts/vidange\">Vidange</a>
    by Jack Usine), or are you looking for suggestions for something completely different?\r\n\r\nThere
    are plenty of \u201Csexy\u201D fonts out there. I'm guessing you need something
    feminine and aggressive, if S&M is the topic."

  body: Vidange is a good suggestions. I think the logo is just Mason Sans. Maybe
    Priori?

    the day...although i'm also looking at altering a DIN, for an industrial feel,
    which this has as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for feedback...any thoughts on feminine
    and agro?"

  body: Not really that feminine, but Tourette comes to mind. Both Mason and Priori
    have serif versions. All can be found <a href="http://www.virusfonts.com/fonts">here</a>.

  body: i think feminine is the wrong route to go for an assignment related to Folsom
    Street fair. Think more 'Tom of Finland' instead of 'Betty Paige'.
