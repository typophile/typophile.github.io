		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi LimCynthia!</p>
<p>I found your goal very interesting, yet highly challenging. It’s not so terribly hard to design a display typeface, but it’s much harder to design a legible sans serif typeface (and even harder to design a great and legible book typeface). Your aim is really hard – you need to design a typeface, which is highly and comfortably legible yet still elegant (while there is definately need of esthetic education for low vision children as well). That’s right on the crossing between art and true science.</p>
<p>As far as I can guess from your sketches, you are propably an autodidact. That doesn’t mean you can’t manage it but that does mean that it will be very hard and long-term work :) If you are more interested in the science part of this project more than on the art side, I would suggest you to build a cooperation with some experienced typographer (while this project seems to be really challenging). If I am totally wrong, please accept my sincere apologies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless – if you’ll decide to work on this project by yourself, I would sugest you to design an easier typeface first just to get familiar with basic principles of building letters – it sounds horrible but I really don’t want to discourage you! :)</p>
<p>Some research in highway signs typefaces would be also very helpful while they’re dealing with similar problems (e.g. <a href="http://www.peterbilak.com/content_items/euroface.html">http://www.peterbilak.com/content_items/euroface.html</a> ).</p>
<p>As you’ve written on your blog, there are few rules you want to follow. To be honest, I’m really not sure that all of them are compatible with your goal. Especially fixed widht and fixed height –  as far as I know, different heights and weights of letters help us to recognize and distinguish different letters. You should propably more concentrate on minimal weight of the strokes and space between them as well so they will not coalesce into a single shape. All essential elements of letters must be shaped exaggeratedly so low vision children will be able to read them.</p>
<p>And last but not least – try to sketch by your hand first :) I would suggest you a thick black marker. This tool will help you to recognize essential shape of each letter and not to bother with unimportant details.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
