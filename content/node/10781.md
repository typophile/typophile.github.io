    Alfa Sans, by Gehlhaar, yes. And it&#39;s very nice. And it was used on the cover
    of the winner of the international &#34;Most Beautiful Book&#34; competition of
    2000. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0104&amp;L=typo-l&amp;P=R1336"

    <BR> <BR>Gehlhaar and Schulz are the two good type designers to come out of CalArts.
    Or maybe they were already good when they went in... <BR> <BR>hhp
