  wide latin but there are some differences...\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's a real font,
  but may be one of you have already seen it!\r\n\r\nWe have to continue the creation
  of new street panels & numbers and it will be a great help if we could find the
  full lettering!!\r\n\r\nThanks for any help !\r\n\r\nRegards :)\r\n\r\n[[http://sereg.free.fr/images/fonts/rochemanie.jpg]]\r\n[[http://sereg.free.fr/images/fonts/pix2.jpg]]\r\n\r\nfew

  body: "The lettering looks hand-drawn. Notice the variations in the serifs on H
    and E letters.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a font, and it doesn't look much like
    anything I can recall.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I agree with Mike. I don\u2019t know if this of any help for you, but Jack
    Usine aka  Jules Vernacular from SMeltery has done typefaces that look like they
    were inspired by similar idiosyncratic French lettering sources, see his <a href=\"http://www.smeltery.net/fonts/sans-merci\">Sans
    Merci</a>, for example."
