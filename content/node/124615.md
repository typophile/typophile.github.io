  body: That's probably not it at all but as the humanist sans on the left reminds
    me of [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_sans|Fedra Sans]], I thought about
    [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_arabic|Fedra Arabic]] but I really don't
    know if it's the one (probably not actually). A way to identify it could be to
    share sample details like the origin, a brand, a website... Anything that could
    help. And if we're a bit lucky, the sans is the latin subset of the arabic type
    you're after.
