  now that I've got my first one out of the way, I'll see if I can help out instead
  of just asking questions.\r\n\r\nI'm pursuing a redesign of my school's paper. I
  just took a look through the archives, and I found that our nameplate once was written
  in this great blackletter (later on we switched to what appears to be Monotype Engravers
  Old English, then to Times (ugh!)). I did a search on Identifont and What the Font,
  as well as searching through some blackletters online, but I couldn't find anything
  that especially resembled it, especially the great uc letters. Using my Bringhurst,
  I think that it's a fraktur or Schwabacher, but I'm not positive. I realize that
  this could be a typeface that hasn't been made digitally (or a custom job), but
  I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about its identity.\r\n\r\nA little bit
  of further info: we used it originally from some time between 1932 and 1940. We
  then reinstated it from approximately '91-'96. The latter fact lends a bit of hope
  to the fact that it might be digital, since we might have gone to Quark by that
  time. Thanks a ton."

  body: "I just took a look at the resources provided by all about seb and timd (thanks
    a ton, BTW!). Claes, I agree, it is \"funky\"; that's why I wanted to know what
    it is. I think that it's a refreshing change from NY Times style blackletter nameplates.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the typeface, the short answer is that none of the typefaces on the two websites
    matched--and I took a look at all of them! But I did find a few things. First,
    the blackletter is definitely fraktur; 90% of the closely matching fonts were
    fraktur. \r\n\r\nFrom timd's link, I found a number of similar typefaces. Albert
    Betenbuch ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/albertbetenbuch/ ) was probably
    the closest on the uc, but the other lc was far too angular. The other good one
    was Faber Fraktur ( http://www.ingofonts.de/ingofonts/index.html ), which, while
    still quite different from the actual nameplate, had a great swoop to the letters
    (especially compare the lc a's and h's).\r\n\r\nI took a look at every single
    one of Dieter Steffmann's fonts. Phew! Couldn't have done it without Maxthon's
    links list. Anyway, there I found a number of close typefaces as well. Gothenburg
    Fraktur has pretty good uc, although again, it's too angular. Other ones I liked
    were Bretkopf Fraktur, Fraktur Shadowed (trying to get that nice outline around
    the uc), Moderne Fraktur (nice sweep to the letters), Peter Schlemihl, Schmale
    Anzeigenschrift Zier (check out the uc!), and Schwabacher. Anyone have any other
    good resources? Also, if anyone's interested, I'd appreciate feedback on the typefaces
    I mentioned above, as to their merits and similarities to mine. Finally, just
    wondering, is mine even a good blackletter? Because I'm thinking that maybe it's
    the distinctiveness of it that I like, not the quality. Thanks again for everything,
    Typophiles."

  body: Thanks a ton, Bald Condensed. I just took a few minutes more to check out
    Linotype and Myfonts. Linotype didn't really have anything I liked, but now that
    I'm looking for similar, not identical typefaces, I found a few I liked. The main
    thing I'm liking is the curved, soft quality to the nameplate. Neue Luthersche
    Fraktur, PhederFrack, Antorff, Monarchia, and NeuAltisch were the best, I think.
    My two favorites of these are Monarchia and Neue Lutersche Fraktur, since they
    combine the flow that I want with the narrow, almost sharp feel of some of the
    nameplate (lc d, lc v). Again, thoughts?

  body: "Gosh :)\r\n\r\nI agree that you won't find any digital font that matches
    your masthead. Would it be possible to digitize what you have? It looks so beautiful
    already!\r\n\r\nWhat you have isn't a fraktur. As was mentioned above, it is similar
    to the historicist, decorative blackletter+art nouveau creations that were very
    popular in Germany, England, and the US (among other places\u2026) during the
    early 20th century. Real fraktur has an uneven \"ying-yang\" rhythm to its strokes
    (schwabacher has an even or opposite ying-yang rhythm). You have interesting,
    original (partial) stroke repetition.\r\n\r\nWhat ever you go with, I would recommend
    something with dark, heavy strokes. I don't think that Monarchia Fett or Luther'sche
    Fraktur are heavy enough.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000020\">Ferox</a>?
    This is also a mix of several different styles. It doesn't remind me of your old
    masthead's letters, but it is one of the best examples of a new blackletter for
    the 21st century yet.\r\n"

    real blackletter or schwabacher, but an \"artistic\" hybrid. These very very,
    very popular in the early 20th century. They seemed to be everywhere."

  body: "Great analysis, Dan. I see what you mean when I look at some of the fraktur's
    I found--they all have that same, angular stroke on the bottom of each of them.
    I'm glad to hear that you like the nameplate.\r\n\r\nRegarding Ferox, I like it,
    as it certainly is more interesting than the many similar frakturs I saw today.
    But I feel that, if we're considering it as a nameplate, it's too heavy. It seems
    like the letters would almost run together (especially with out cruddy printing
    and paper), but maybe it's just my unjustified fear of being too bold, which I
    may have to get over.\r\n\r\nTo clarify my intentions with this project: I'm looking
    at our 90 years of issues as partial inspiration for a redesign of the current
    paper. Maybe once I get closer, I'll pop back in here to ask for some opinions
    on past, present, and (maybe) future type and layout. For now, I was just curious
    to see whether I could find such an interesting blackletter. I'm not sure whether
    I'll end up using it or a blackletter for our nameplate, but your comments have
    certainly increased my interest in it.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. You mentioned digitizing
    this nameplate. I just checked the forums, and I couldn't find anything directly
    dealing with it. I'm downloading the demo for Scanfont, which I saw mentioned
    on one post. I was wondering what you would recommend for digitizing the nameplate,
    which I may or may not do (to paraphrase, a pretty big \"may\"). I do have AI
    CS2, so I can do a live trace on the nameplate. It did an okay job, but not great
    (especially on the outline around the uc). Would you recommend using one of these
    two methods for getting a rough version and then going in manually with the pen
    tool? Or would you suggest all manual? Or something else? Thanks."

    that this would work. If I were doing it, I would place the scan in Illustrator,
    and draw new outlines on top, using the placed image as a guide. But cleaning
    up an auto trace might work, too, depending on how good the trace was\u2026 those
    auto-tracing engines are getting better and better."
