  body: "Please don\u2019t post the same question in more than one place. Thank you.
    I have deleted the other thread.\r\n\r\nHave you consulted the Wiki? [[Typography]]
    vs. [[Lettering]]. The former deals with the reproduction of pre-made letterforms,
    mainly as in type-setting with fonts (regardless whether those are in metal, film
    or digital form). It also comprises the use of a typewriter, rub-down letters,
    stencils or potato stamps, for example. \r\n\r\nFor your second question, see
    Yves\u2019 article on The FontFeed, <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/font-or-typeface/\">Font
    or Typeface?</a>\r\nF"
