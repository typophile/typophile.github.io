  body: Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to rip on ya, Chris. In fact, Jon&#39;s reaction <BR>shows
    it&#39;s not a bad idea to repost some old stuff once in a <BR>while. Not everyone
    has seen everything.

  body: Thanks for posting the link, Chris. Though it has indeed been around for a
    while, as Eduardo says and Stewf jokes, it&#39;s really heartening to me that
    the movie still finds new fans.

    on the sequel. Just you wait, Chesh. On second thought, don&#39;t wait... just
    get cracking. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Yes, I do need to get cracking on that, though, you know, the sequel is coming
    after the other movie, which itself hasn&#39;t even been started yet. My dearest
    hope is to have it done by TypeCon. I really need to make a schedule to actually
    get it to happen. <BR> <BR>Is there any way I can arrange it so making these movies
    is my full-time job? Does anyone know of a fellowship for making short movies
    about typefaces? I&#39;ll be most grateful for any leads.
