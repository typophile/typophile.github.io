  body: This looks similar to House&#39;s Gorilla Text &#40;see below for a crude
    rendering&#41; with the dots over the &#34;i&#34;s made circular. Also similar
    are extended black humanistic faces such as Frutiger and Myriad. However, all
    of these are not an exact match.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/50475.jpg"
