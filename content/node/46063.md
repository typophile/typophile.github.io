  body: Closest I can get is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/trade_gothic_std_bold_condensed_no_20/?sample_text=VOTE%20LINCOLN&sample_size=74">Trade
    Gothic Bold Cond</a> but that's not it. Not <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/alternate_gothic_com_no_2/?sample_text=VOTE%20LINCOLN&sample_size=74">Alt
    Gothic</a> or Alpin either.
