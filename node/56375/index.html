  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there,

I am basically interested in finding out more about (links would be great) fonts and its protection.

I recently encountered a couple of situations with clients where they demanded the fonts/typefaces used. They wouldn't understand that we can't just give away $400+ family. Not to mention that costs can go up based on the users or system that will have this family installed. 

For one client we actually stated that the purchase of a single weight would be necessary since we were going after something extremely unique. Client here was billed for the project, and of course the font purchase was part of the whole cost. Now couple of weeks later, they want that font because they said they paid for it. They say that they shouldn't pay for a font that we would end up using for a future clients some time.

Then last week 2 programmers were having a discussion with some designers like myself, on fonts and its protections. They were arguing in favor of:
• purchasing a font, deleting it from your computer, and giving it away to the client after completion of the project. They couldn't say much after somebody asked about what would happen if the designer was to do another job for them. What do client need to delete the font again, and send it to the designer?
• they were saying that since fonts are software, nobody, not even type foundries can put exclusive rights or laws to the fonts, like limiting users. They said that it doesn't matter that foundries want to add to their legal blurbs, it's software and one SHOULD be able to transfer or give away the font without having to purchase another copy of it.
• they basically said all that stuff about foundries charging more if 5 users will use the font rather than 1 or if 50 will instead of 10, is BS. They said nothing foundries want should be taken seriously because in the end they are software and nothing else.

So, Can fonts be transferable? Can they be given away as long as they are deleted from the computer of the first user?

If a clients pays for a service, and a font is bought and added to the cost of the project, could the designer/programmer end up giving the entire family away to the client before deleting the family from the computers of the designers/programmers?

What are the exact laws surrounding transferring fonts? How do you people charge for fonts if a projects calls for something that news to be purchased? How do you deal with people that want the font? How do you protect yourselves from clients that request the fonts?

Do type foundries have actual legal voice on this regard since the programmers we talked to said that they can come up with every rule/limitations on the usage but it has NO legal valu in the end.
Do type foundries ever find out about users that have done something against their copyright info?

Thanx everybody for any possible input you might have.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Seems as if everything here should be clearly called out in your contract with the font supplier (ie the font EULA you agreed to) and your legal contract with the client (which you also agreed to). 

If you want to extract yourself from these legal obligations then you probably need to talk to an attorney and not a bunch of font geeks or programmers. 

If your contract with the client calls for fonts along with all other assets to be handed over to them, and the font EULA does not allow for transfers then you're best bet would be to refund the client the cost of the license or simply license it on their behalf.

I would not take legal advice from programmers. Even if you are a "one disk company" -  ie one licensed copy of PhotoShop, one licensed copy of Visual Studio, one copy of Mac OS, installed on multiple machines that's one thing, you can take that risk. But are you in a position to pass on this level or risk to your clients?  </div>

He does know about law and the legality of software. He understands just fine that one can't just make copies of photoshop and give them away. Since he is stuck in the middle of us as a studio and the client he is trying to benefit the client and keep them happy. This is why he is claiming that the fonts should be (THEY HAVE TO BE, coz foundries have no opinion on this matter according to him) able to be given away fully to the client as long as we delete them completely from our systems.


if anybody has some links where I can see in detail font copyright information and a big plus would be if I could see if software laws overwrite ANYTHING set by the foundries.

Sad thing is that someone here will likely give you an answer that supports your desire to rip off the font designer, and you'll be happy. Best of luck with that.

Did I say I want to do the wrong thing? Did I "f" say I want to rip off the typographer? I don't ever want to do this, this is why i am asking for some good reads, comment and links so i can better articulate my reason to the client.

I am arguing AGAINST giving the font away for free. I (we) support typographers, except the clients and the programmers who are giving us a hard time.

WE DO NOT WANT TO GIVEN IT AWAY FOR FREE!! We already talked to all these people and politely explained the situation and we sent them to the proper links so THEY can purchase the font legally. WHY IS THIS MY FAULT NOW? 

It's not about me! I just wanted some input, links, comments, thoughts on regards to the EULA of fonts and the general software laws so that I CAN MORE CLEARLY EXPLAIN THIS to the clients.

Sorry, there are no easy answers. 

Some font EULAS do allow transfer, providing the new licensee accepts the terms of the EULA.

<em>...if anybody has some links...</em>

You can study EULAs of different foundries online. 
Google a foundry name and "EULA".
Or search a multi-foundry distributor such as MyFonts.</div>

Exactly. These people are trying to find loopholes everywhere to argue in favour of pirating fonts.  Not me.

This is why I came here to find out what some professionals and typographers that frequent this site can say. To see what my fellow posters could suggest since actual type designers post in here.</div>

Second you should put your font licensing terms in the contract and have it worked out BEFORE the client signs it. Third, if you have a repeat client who insists that the font license be transferred back to them at the end of the job, don’t buy non-transferable font licenses when working with that client. If you really, really want to transfer the license, pester the designer to grant a non-transferable license. </div>

I for one, being a simpleton, would think that the font licence now belongs to the client, not to the studio (i.e. the studio purchased the font on behalf of the client). The client then should ensure that their usage is in accordance with the original licence, or upgrade it as needed. The studio would not be allowed to keep a copy of the font for their own use. The client however could allow the studio to use the font for their own jobs.

In other words, you cannot have your cake and eat it too.</div>

did you bill them _specifically_ for the font?  if so, 
i'd say that they bought it, so they own it, not you.

and of course they will want the font, because they
might need to change something in what you did...

so give 'em the font, and erase it from your machine.
what they do with it will then be of no concern to you.

even if you didn't bill them for the font _specifically_,
handing it over is the easiest way to extricate yourself
from a situation which has already become unpleasant.

so use your head.

and if they want you to do any work for them again,
tell them your overhead cost will require a purchase
of a font in _your_ name, which _you_ will then own.
if they say that you can use _their_ copy of the font,
say you don't roll that way, and don't want to start...

better yet, turn down the job.  unpleasant clients have
a nasty habit of repeating their unpleasantness later...

One doesn't BUY a font. A font (or any other software) is LICENSED. Anyone who wants to use it needs to have a single license. So the fonts cannot be given to the client, even if they were charged for it. If the clients want to use it, they need to purchase their own license. 

Or if the font foundry would allow it: A transfer of the license from the studio to the client might be possible. But even this needs some written statement from the foundry. One cannot just give the fonts away like a book or something ...

Sure they help. The difference between buying and licensing is the core of the VectorM's question. 

<cite>i’m telling vectorm the client paid for the license...
so vectorm should hand over the font to the client.</cite>

Again: it doesn't matter who paid for the fonts. What matters is who is has a license to install and use the fonts. 

<cite>if he was gonna bill the client for the font (license),
he should’ve bought it in their name to begin with.</cite>

No, if they would license the font in the client's name, the studio would have no license to use the fonts for the design work in the first place. 
They client has to account for all the costs associated with the project, but that doesn't mean they "own" any of the tools (hard- or software) that were used to fulfill the project.

there's absolutely no difference between the two
that is of relevance to any aspect of this question.

not in the mind of this non-lawyer, anyway...


>   Again: it doesn’t matter who paid for the fonts.

vectorm's client paid for the font, so the license
to install and use the font belongs to that client.

the client let vectorm install and use the font to do
work for them, and now that he's done, he should
erase that font from his machine.  and the client
should be given the font they have paid to license,
since it appears that they do not have it presently.

if vectorm thought the client would pay for the font,
but vectorm would get to have the license in his name,
then i'd say he is the one who is badly mistaken here...

if vectorm hadn't billed the client specifically for the font,
but rather bought it using money from his own company,
and bundled the cost into his overall billing for the project
(in exactly the same way that he bundles the cost of his rent
and his computers and all his other overhead), then fine,
the license belongs to _him_ and not to the client, and he
has every right to explain this in great detail to the client.

if font-designers want to try to enforce such silliness,
good luck...  but that can only erode the willingness of
your customers to actually do what's expected of them,
which will cause you even more problems down the line.

I do understand your logic behind this, but it is still plain wrong. And this is no silly idea of type foundries - this is how every license(!) whatsoever works. It is a contract between a grantor of a license and the licensee (->user). Whether or not the price of this license appears on the bill of the studio to the client, doesn't affect the license agreement in any way. </div>

ok, first, i'm glad you understand my logic.  it's the logic of the layman.

and no matter how type foundries write their licenses, that logic will
continue to be the logic of the layman.  and if you tell them it's wrong,
they will ignore you.  and it's dangerous for you to set that precedent.

i'm not trying to _justify_ their behavior.  just telling you it's _inevitable_.


>   It is a contract between a grantor of a license and the licensee (->user).

and the client in this situation believes that _they_ are "the licensee"...
heck, they paid for the font, so why would they _not_ be "the licensee"?

the fact (if it is a fact, and let's keep in mind vectorm hasn't verified it)
that vectorm put _his_ name on the license rather than _their_ name
-- and then had the gall to actually bill 'em specifically for the font --
means that vectorm was (in their opinion) pulling a fast one on them.

so their beef is not (necessarily) with the font designer, or even the
license per se, but with vectorm and their opinion of what he's doing.

if they had installed the font on one of the computers in their shop,
you'd have no problem with it.  instead they put it on the machine of
a person who was doing design work for them.  what's the difference?
(this is not a rhetorical question.  if there is a difference, what is it?)

i'm perfectly willing to admit that i may have everything wrong.

so enlighten me.

They didn't pay for the font, they paid for the design work, which required a font license to be bought in order to be fulfilled. 



<cite>the fact that vectorm put _his_ name on the license rather than _their_ name ...

This is how thousands of licenses are purchased every day and exactly the way how it should be. Again: The billing is a totally different matter. And I don't think there is an easy answer to the question whether or not a studio should bill a font license to the client. It depends. We usually wouldn't charge for standard fonts, which we can use for many clients. These costs are devided between all our clients like the costs for hardware, rent and so on. 
If the font are somewhat special we usually include it in the bill but rather disguise it somewhere (to avoid such discussions about "buying fonts"). 
If the client requires a very special or expensive font, which will only be used for this client, we would put it in the bill, and explain to him how licensing software works. So far they we didn't have problems with that. It's not that difficult to understand how licensing works ...

the way i read it, i agree with the client.  and if you tell me that the "license"
says differently, i'd chalk it up to another "license" that rips off the consumer.
we're getting used to those.  we see 'em all the time.  and ignore 'em just fine.
you know, napster wouldn't have been _nearly_ as tragic to the music industry
if consumers hadn't felt the record labels had been ripping them off for years,
charging far too much for albums with a couple "killers" and all the rest "fillers".
so when those music fans had a chance to return the "favor", they did, in spades.
they "ripped off" the labels, and felt _justified_, because _fairness_ was restored.

so it seems to me you're being dishonest with your clients just like vectorm.
and my best guess is that it would seem that way to vectorm's clients as well.
and your clients too, if the truth were not "disguised", and discussion averted.

i'm sorry if that offends you...  but that's what i truly honestly actually think...

No, I am not. I have a legal license (in my studio's name) which I need to have in order to install and use the font. There is no other way to do it. That's how it works  - ask any software vendor, read any software license or ask any lawyer. They will all tell you the same. I did my best to explain it as simple as I can.

Once a job is quoted, if you run into a font issue in which you need to make an expensive purchase, it has to be justified to the client at some point, preferably before the purchase is made. Otherwise, you eat the cost which may be most of the profit for the job.

so, are you telling me that vectorm could not "install and use"
a font that was _legally_licensed_ in the name of his client to
do work for that client?  again, this is not a rhetorical question.


>   There is no other way to do it.

oh, there is most definitely another way to do it, or we
wouldn't even be having this conversation.  the thing is,
the "other way" might or might not be "legal", according to
a license to which people might or might not pay attention.

licenses rarely include language precluding the impossible.

In these days the client pays for the software you use and all other costs of doing business. Be it in the form of a surcharge on your hourly rate (more convenient), or on a per item base.

If I client wants files (including fonts), he pays extra (a lot extra, if I can get it) for receiving these. If I think the fonts I bought for a project will be needed again in future, but the client wants the fonts too, I will buy another license and transfer that to the client, billing the client for the license and the time I spent arranging everything. Or I tell the client that it‘s cheaper to buy a license all by himself (a URL may be provided by me, as a courtesy).

I can't believe how disrespectful this thread has been between members of Typophile. Before jumping to conclusions that a member is advocating piracy because of a licensing question (or any other inquiry for that matter), read the post's content carefully and ensure that you are interpreting it correctly, and consider if English is even their first language. This alone can force a misinterpretation of an innocent question.

Don't forget we have unregistered visitors who come to Typophile to learn about typography and the stuff associated with it, such as the originally posted topic here. The tangents  in this thread (this one included) are not characteristic of our community. Take that kind of crap elsewhere.</div>

Well if you re-read the thread I assumed goodwill until the original poster pushed on the issue of looking for a legal basis that would allow his company to ignore EULA terms they agreed to. I’m sorry he got upset and left, but my guess is that he came to the realization that he was indeed doing someone else’s dirty work for them. </div>

That was exactly why I jumped on this thread. If you look at the myriad of similar questions that have come up in the past, sooner or later some Perry Mason wan-a-be will come out of the woodwork, with some legal gobbledygook that "proves" EULAs are worthless and that all fonts are public domain. I think it’s important to call BS on that early and often for the sake of the lurkers.

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>so, are you telling me that vectorm could not “install and use”
a font that was _legally_licensed_ in the name of his client to
do work for that client? again, this is not a rhetorical question.</cite>

It depends on the license. It's as simple as that. If you're asking if vectorm could make a copy for use on his own computer, most font licenses would not allow that unless vectorm were an employee, not a freelancer. Or he can license the font up front and later transfer the license (most font EULAs seem to allow this, though not all).

It's my understanding that in the USA, a EULA that is agreed to by the licensor is legally binding, as long as the terms are not "unconscionable" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscionable)  and do not require illegal actions. They *can* restrict people from doing things that they would be legally allowed to do if they didn't agree to the license. Of course, I'm not a lawyer, and like anybody who has had way too many dealings with the corporate world, I do recommend consulting a lawyer for legal advice.

If people care, they can choose fonts based in part on the licensing terms. Interestingly, if users ignore the licensing terms anyway, there isn't much point in font vendors trying to make their license terms more appealing, is there?

IMO, comparing this to the RIAA is more than a little misleading. Although there are plenty of other font use cases, it seems here we're talking specifically about people who are <strong>making money</strong> from their use of the fonts. Not personal use at all.

If I were creating a font license myself (a situation I foresee within the next couple of years), I would certainly *consider* having a clause to allow usage-by-contractors and usage-by-output-providers, as long as everyone with simultaneous access was licensed. So you could let a contractor or output provider use the font, as long as you didn't exceed the number of simultaneous licensed users, and they did not keep a copy of the font when the work was done.

But then again, while I lean towards liberalism as far as font license terms for my own fonts, I strongly support other creators' rights to set license terms they are comfortable with. I think they *ought* to set license terms their users can live with, too, but I don't think they have a moral obligation to do so, because any customer who actually cares about following the terms of their EULA has plenty of choices out there.

Cheers,

I am actually correct! I am associated with a Trade Mark Attorney and the Mark held by Unilever is protected in their environment. This is not the case with Ariel as a description of a font. Unilever may send a 'Cease and Desist' letter, but the case would not stand in court. That said, Helvetica as a mark is protected but the software as a vector is not. A check with relevant government Trade Mark registration would identify the 'owner' and limitation regarding the mark</div>

FAIL! The font is called Arial, and it's a Monotype trademark, and according to their attorney, its a very strong one partly because of the spelling. Arial is protected, even though it is widely distributed.

>I am associated with a Trade Mark Attorney 

Sadly on typophile that's the best we can hope for. People who are willing to play attorney based on association. That's fine, it’s fun to play, but as microspective noted there are people who assume we collectively know what we're talking about when it comes to IP law.

Yes it's called PDF.

>I don’t think I am unique in that I have thousands of fonts purchased over 20 years and I can’t tell you what each font license says.

Fortunately most licenses allow PDF font embedding at least for "work-flow" so the chances you're out of compliance are slim.

I agree. I haven't send an open file to a printer in years. I only use PDF, and all printers I've worked with so far prefer / demand PDF.

> <em>Why do you allow printers to edit your work? You might as well have the printer do the whole process, the design and the printing!</em>

That's a silly remark, since before there was PDF (or before it became a standard) it was very normal to send the open files to the printer (xpress files).</div>

Most font EULAs include a section on sharing with service bureaus and printers for those of you in still in the stone age. I know you've lost all your EULAs :-( but if I would be a printer I would be a bit scared of the XPress 2.0 file and 20 year old font.</div>

But I guess I don't know enough about what Pattie's printing. Maybe it requires last minute changes before printing? I'd hate to know the costs (time, budget, resources) of that type of workflow...</div>

I try to send finalized art but sometimes a last minute change is required. I have them do the change for speed. 

>>You might as well have the printer do the whole process, the design and the printing!<<

There is a big difference between editing type and designing a package.

>>those of you in still in the stone age<<

Yeah, the last project I did was printed in Chili. They asked me to recreate the art in Freehand....can you believe that? I complained to my boss but he just said do what you have to do they are a 3rd world country, they are difficult to work with and they will not buy the software. You know what I said? I said, OK. Hey, I like what I do and I like my job. Unlike some of you, I don't run the show, I don't have clients, I work for a company. If refuse to allow the printers access to my working files, my boss will refuse to allow access to my working.

I was looking around at some EULAs it seems more often than not sending to service bureaus is only allowed if the can prove they have a license for the font. Interestingly if you review instructions from service Beureaus they all say to include fonts with the files. 

I am going to start sending files sans font's with a duplicate outlined version. I will list the fonts and state that we do not send fonts due to licensing restrictions. Lets see how that goes!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One problem with sending fonts to the printer is that he may get the idea he can do other little jobs for your client, using the fonts you have paid to license, and cutting your company out of the loop.

These would be "simple" design-and-print jobs that he will convince your client not to use your design firm for, because you will charge to much. How is the printer able to undercut you? Not having to pay for the fonts helps.

It happened to me.

True. I have to be careful phrasing things like that. For example, my husband doesn't like it when I say "you always.... (fill in the blanks)
I also have to say "I think" rather than "I feel" more

When I look around on the internet at Printers web sites I have noticed, they often require fonts to be included with the document.

True and True that's the terminology I was seeing in the EULAs. I take it to mean pre-press department.

What I usually get is fonts not converted to outlines, designs with virtually no margin or space for bleeds, or worse - bitmaps. For some reason, designers do not understand that a CNC router can not do anything with a bitmap - even one embedded in a pdf or illustrator file. It's a boat anchor.  Most times, the designer is unavailable, can't get new art in time for us to meet our deadline, or has quoted such a high price to convert their photoshop files to vector art as to be prohibitive (not to me but to the client). What is left is a late night for me (and even with overtime, it isn't worth it).

Australia is great very modern up to date the quality of printing is top notch. 

Chili has been a challenge.  We send email after email, we call and "yes yes no problem" than two weeks later it's, "what is a dyeline?" and.."Oh yes no problem" a week later they say "we are still waiting on the art please send it" and I say "but I have no dyeline"...they say, "yes yes no problem." Finally I send them the files and tell them to size it or edit it as needed. Nothing happens until they have files and than they either send me the dyeline (at last) or adjust the art. Language is a barrier as well as suppliers who don't want me contacting the producers and the producers don't want me contacting their printers. </div>
