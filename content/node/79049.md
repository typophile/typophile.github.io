  relatively short letters to either companies or individuals.  I narrowed the list
  down to Stempel Garamond LT Std, Garamond Premiere Pro, Adobe Caslon Pro or Minion
  Pro.  Does anyone have any preferences or suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks "

  body: "@kupfers - This is mostly my own personal correspondence.  I was writing
    some legal letters a year ago and became very interested in type face during that
    time frame.  It's really amazing how typeface can even alter the way a letters
    comes across.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm leaning towards Stempel Garamond for the
    body.  I think Lyon looks great, however it's too pricey.  Do you have any other
    recommendations for letterhead and/or body?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "My advise for affordable typefaces would be the following:\r\n\r\nEpic seems
    to be interesting:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/epic/\r\n\r\nIn a
    summery about classical text fonts of the pre-digital age, found here: http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=19\r\nthere
    are some fonts highlighted as \"having survived the transition to digital well\".
    I personally like Sabon, Dante und Janson, which are available for 29USD a weight.
    Albertina is a fine piece of work, but the Dutch Type Library is not a cheap foundry.
    \r\n\r\nDSType has a couple of nice serifs: Glosa, Leitura, Musee, Capsa\r\nhttp://www.dstype.com/\r\n\r\nOne
    font I have never heard being mentioned by anybody \u2013 nor can I find any information
    about the foundry \u2013 is Pevensey. It is very affordable, and is very similar
    to Times, but does not have the condensed proportions. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aah-yes/pevensey/\r\n\r\nInteresting
    as well is SFPL from Stone Type foundry, a classical looking serif font for only
    39USD for the whole family. There is no bold italic and the character range is
    rather small though. http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/sfploverview.html\r\n\r\nAll
    of the above mentioned come with the advantage, that they are not any of the usual
    suspects. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are even some interesting typefaces for free available:\r\n\r\nA
    common newspaper font is Utopia, available for LaTeX uses for free here: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utopia/\r\nDid
    not read up on the licence situation here. \r\n\r\nPTSerif was just released:
    http://www.paratype.com/public/\r\n\r\nJunicode follows the classic English old-style
    typefaces:\r\nhttp://junicode.sourceforge.net/\r\nbut personally I would recommend
    to expand it by 3 or 4 per cent. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith all the advise keep in mind
    please that I am not an expert. Let your eyes be the judges and please check if
    the character range suits your demands. \r\n\r\n"
