body: I am working on a project that requires a type face that has made a dramatic
  transition from Old World typographic style to a modern font that would be good
  to use for informational design. If anyone has any ideas please email me at ead_design@sbcglobal.net
  or submit an answer to this forum on the website. Thanks.
