  The branding logo comes from Remake Design in Brooklyn, NY. http://www.remakedesign.com\r\n\r\nIs
  anyone able to ID the typeface used for the logo?"

    This could be a Helvetica or even Arial. Maybe with the left part of J made of
    U, that is a good observation indeed."

  body: Albert, you're right! I spoke too soon. I just mocked it up and it is indeed
    Helvetica Bold with a modified J based on U. Thanks for the correction! Cheers!!!
