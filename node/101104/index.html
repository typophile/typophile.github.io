  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone,

I just downloaded the latest build of the Adobe Font Developer Toolkit to install on my newly reformatted machine and I'm having a problem...

One of the most useful Fontlab Macros that it came with was the CheckOutlines macro, but not I guess the FDK doesn't come with it, only as an osx tool.

Would anyone who happens to have this macro be willing to share it with me?

Thanks!
Josh</div>

I'm not aware of a later version of the FDK. What version do you have?

::edit::   I just found a November version on my machine I hadn't updated to yet, but the file is still there and the path is the same.

The FDK folder needs to be placed into your FontLab folder just as it is; don't move anything out of the FDK folder. Then run the file "finishinstall".

Restart your FontLab app and it should work.</div>

Also, just to be extra sure, when you say "The FDK folder needs to be placed into your FontLab folder" do you mean place it inside the folder...

Library/Application Support/Fontlab     
or
Library/Application Support/Fontlab/Studio 5

		<div class="commentbody">Man, this is really frustrating, haha.

In the past, the FDK installed the checkOutlines macro INTO Fontlab, not as a separate python script that needs to be run on its own. Now when I install it, I get a handfull of other Macro sets in Fontlab (Anchors, Hinting, Kerning, MM Designs, Contributed, Effects, Export), but nothing that contains the checkOutlines script.

If you don't mind humoring me, what steps do you go through to actually run the scripts within the Tools/SharedData/FDKScripts folder? Maybe I am just going about it in the wrong way?

thanks again for all your help, I really appreciate it.

Also, are you on Fontlab 5.1 ? Maybe i'm having trouble with some sort of incompatibility since I've already updated?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">FontLab Studio 5.1.3 here.

I have a FontLab Folder in my Applications folder which I think is a remnant from version 4, but that's where the FDK is. In both my application support folders there is FontLab stuff too, put there I presume during an install of something since I have four or five of their apps -- plus this machine has been through four or five upgrades of differing versions of OS X over time. Even with all the other stuff, the FDK is still in Applications>FontLab Studio. The latest version of 5.x.x installs the app outside of that folder which is why I say it is a remnant.

If you run the finishinstallOSX program that is contained in the FDK folder it sets the environment path to the FDK so very likely you can put it wherever you want it just as long as you run that little program after you move it. Also, in the FontLab folder in the FDK Tools folder is another program to run to install the macros into FontLab -- which it appears you have already done.

As for the CheckOutlines.py script, it is accessible from within Python with all the other third-party scripts. Select "Outlines" in the first scripts dropdown, then choose "Outline Check" in the second; it is the one to run. It runs then writes a log file and shows the path to the log file.

These things get kind of frustrating sometimes, don't they?   :-)

		<div class="commentbody">George, the problem is mentioned in the previous post by gargoyle . Basically, the most recent release is missing a lot of the third-party macros that were present in the previous releases of the FDK.

For me, there is no "Outlines" choice in the first drop down, it installs a handful of other tools, but I guess they don't actually include any of Outlines scripts as macros anymore...

If you or anyone is willing to upload the Outlines macros folder for me (and maybe the other macros folders the FDK use to install), I would be very grateful! Let me know if you need my email address or maybe you could just temporary upload it to a site like wetransfer.com or something.

Thanks.
