  body: "Not sure where the idea of \"web equivalent\" comes from. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/locator/|Locator]]
    is Locator, but if you want to know which widely available font is most similar,
    I would say Verdana, although the l is not curved, the C is more closed, and the
    G is a different style. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
