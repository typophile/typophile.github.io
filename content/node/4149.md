    Chesh probably does.

  body: I have seen it in McDonald&#39;s Promotions and on the X-Files CCG. Now this.
    Just don&#39;t know what it is or where to get it. Any help is much appreciated.

  body: Bless your heart, Ignacio, for putting me out of my misery -- this has been
    bugging me all day. I guess it&#39;s been a long time since I actually saw Frankie;
    I must have even had it at one time, since it looked so familiar, but I don&#39;t
    have it anymore. Nice job!
