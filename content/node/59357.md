body: "We've just released a new font based on old metal type called Foundry Ornament,
  which features heraldic creatures and floral designs from old metal type.  The first
  font of this sort we've done in more than a year, and the result is very appealing.\r\n\r\nWe
  also just made available a major revision of our classic Tuscarora font, which has
  been quite popular but is now upgraded with additional alternate characters and
  an expanded character set.  \r\n\r\nSamples of both are attached and you can check
  them out along with new articles and features at <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com\">fontcraft.com</a>.\r\n\r\nDave"
