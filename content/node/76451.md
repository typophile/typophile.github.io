body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a sans that can be combined with Mendoza. It should
  provide proper contrast without being unharmonious. I would use Mendoza as the main
  text face, also for things like the index (in an atlas-like book) and would like
  the companion face for emphasis, headers, footers etc. A more \"neutral\" sans would
  be preferred. I combined Photina with Unitus (URW's version of Univers) before,
  but as Mendoza has hardly any contrast, and Photina a lot I don't think Unitus would
  be good match for Mendoza. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: I quite like it, though it might be a bit too humanist for this. And besides
    that its way above my budget... :-(

  body: That's great Nick! I have just been doing a pitch recently using just that
    combination. It works well. I was fortunate that the agency where I worked had
    a licence for Legato, so I tried to make good use of it! Unfortunately I don't
    have Legato licenced myself (a tad expensive), but I do have a licence for your
    very own Sensibility, and my first impression is that it goes very well together
    with Mendoza. I will certainly test this combination some more.

  body: Legato would be great. I'm curious about your "tad expensive" remark. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_legato/">FF
    Legato</a> is $71 per OpenType font (all features included) or $44 per font for
    the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_legato_regular/?affid=99346">TT
    or PS</a> equivalents. What would you consider more reasonable?

  body: I'm not saying the price isn't reasonable, but 400 to 500 euro for a 4 weight
    family is expensive for me, as I'm still building my own business. If I could
    buy it for a paid job it might be otherwise, but for now it's not in my budget.
