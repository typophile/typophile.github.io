<div class=commentbody>That's always bugged me, that Lost doesn't use Futura for the "boom" tag at the end. It's as if it was a last minute addition and they didn't have the correct font handy. Now they're stuck with it and would get complaints from fans if they changed it (presumably). The title graphics are otherwise pretty good, so it's like seeing someone in a nicely tailored suit with flip-flops.
My theory is that all these shows are edited on Macs* in Final Cut Pro and the producers don't bother to put the branding fonts on the machines. So you end up seeing a lot of system fonts used. It still can't believe the end credits for the Sopranos are set in Geneva. All six seasons.
* I say "Macs" because I see so many Mac-only system fonts used. I'm sure there are studios that use Windows for editing tv shows, too. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I bet you're right, Mark. Though, font annoyance aside, it's nice to know which 'boom' is the last one. Particularly given that the shows endings are often as unresolved as the commercial breaks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I love Charlie Rose's show, which is one of the best things in American television. And I cringe every time I see the logo. He has even had shows on design, but obviously, like so many people who are otherwise culturally knowledgeable and sophisticated, when it comes to graphic design and typography, he doesn't get it. </div>

Sorry Australia, but America gets more watchable TV shows than we do down here. This much I know.
<em>Seriously, why not Arial, TNR, or Comic Sans?</em>
Surely there are a few TV show logos done with Arial and TNR? Helvetica is commonplace so Arial isn't out of contention. I can think of at least one animated children's TV show that uses Comic Sans (or a similar font) but the name escapes me right now.

<div class=commentbody>I have seen a few of Charlie Rose's shows, and it really is reassuring as you say William, to see how the other half lives in the U.S. That there is another half. I was kidding in my opening line back there.
I'm circumspect of television in general because I've worked on TV adverts, and the standard of programming down here is pretty lame. For example, I can't see <em>SNL</em> unless I pay for cable TV, which is still withering value for money here. I've seen plenty of intelligence on shows like <em>MAD TV</em> but it's only screened on free-to-air TV at 3am.

<div class=commentbody>I haven't watched much TV at all on the TV itself for about a year. I watch particular shows online, though. For example, you can watch any interview you want at charlierose.com/search , and watch full episodes of Lost at abc.com/player . But the ABC player restricts video to US IP addresses.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Aluminum correctly pointed out that Verdana is a screen font, perhaps only to play devil's advocate, but isn't hinting kind of pointless on a CRT TV, which renders differently than even a CRT computer monitor? (Also, it's the title of the show, so it should be big enough to go with a display font anyway.)

Couldn't agree more... in fact any use of Bank Gothic is over use. I seriously do not see the appeal of that font.
So, I don't come off as a whiner, I do like NBC's use of Klavika, their promos are always well designed. </div>
