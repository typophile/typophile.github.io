    <BR>the hoefler has some old revived sans-serif&#39;s and the boys of letterror

  body: ' Knockout, Gotham &#40;caps only&#41;, and Gotham Condensed might be good
    choices from among our collection at typography.com, unless you&#39;re a stickler
    for absolute historical accuracy. That is, these faces can easily engender a Dust
    Bowl feeling if used appropriately, but strictly speaking they&#39;re all new
    designs from 2000. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re going for museum-piece accuracy, look
    for typefaces issued by the Ludlow or Barnhart Brothers &amp; Spindler type foundries
    -- you can probably do some sleuthing at myfonts.com. But to get you started,
    try Tempo, Cheltenham, Franklin Gothic &#40;not ITC&#41;, Cooper Black, Alternate
    Gothic, Post Roman, Copperplate, Radiant, Agency Gothic, Poster Gothic, Bank Gothic,
    or the ineluctable Goudy Old Style. As always in typography, finding the right
    font is only half the battle -- the real challenge comes in composing them properly.

    signs, the most typical face would be the sans serif set in all caps. '

    la signage&#41;, then you may want to try contacting John Downer &#40;he&#39;ll
    be at TypeCon in Toronto next weekend&#41;. He&#39;s an accomplished sign painter,
    as well as a type designer, from Iowa -- you can&#39;t get much more midwest than
    that, I suppose -- and he&#39;s a collector and aficionado of public display lettering
    from this era. I&#39;ll bet he could offer expert advice. '
