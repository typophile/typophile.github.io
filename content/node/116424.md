  body: <strong>NeoPrisma</strong> is a digitization of Dan X. Solo [(c) 2000 by Dover
    Publications, Inc] which comes very close to your sample, except of capital /B
    which seems strangely cut-off at the "lowercase" level.

  body: The 2 and 3 in the Dan Solo version also appear to be cut off at the top -
    interesting - need to find his source.

  body: (All the versions I've seen have that same B and several other characters.
    . . probably was created from that "old movie title"...)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b1_6024.jpg]

  body: Except we now have the B complete in the image for identification - I bet
    another version is out hiding somewhere.
