  I've just been creating these versions and like to point out some things: personally,
  i like the latter font most, thus i created some versions concerning kerning and
  ligatures. #3 + #4 are my favorite shapes, #3 connects visual design + a positive
  line upwards, #4 points to the (european) DIN size-page with a piece detached, leaving
  the blue area as the shape of the varnish-free area on folding boxes. lastly, there's
  everywhere a negative space in it, depicting the \"/\"stroke in \"Z\" (Zett).\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your forthrightness!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zettlogo_4081.jpg]"

    from the di lig, most of the ligatures look a little forced to me and i am wondering
    wether\r\nthey are necessary at all?  I am not 100% sold on the font choice either,
    although i do like the\r\nsoftness. Have you tried a more traditional arrangement
    of mark & name?\r\n{Mark} {centered name}"

  body: "I find the italicized logotypes (1, 3a) a bit more pleasing, visually. The
    only thing I would fix is the 'Z' to fit the harmonious curvature of the other
    letters (you don't have to, not critical). The ligatures connecting the S-t and
    d-i in the straight ones make it look too tight and close together.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
    for the logo shapes, 1, despite it being first, caught my attention immediately.
    It says \"zing! I have an idea!\" the snapping of fingers. I also like 4, but
    I find it too simple. You should try more variations of 4. I found 3 to be a little
    pepsi-ish."

  body: "Frankly all ligatures in your logotype looks very unnatural to me. My first
    instinct would be to work on the harmonious ending stroke of \"Zett\" and make
    that into a distinctive logotype while taking a plain approach on \"Studio\" --
    maybe same font, but lighter stroke, and no distortion whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe
    colors need some tweaking, too. Bur first and foremost: Get rid of all gradient,
    that's a no-brainer."

  body: "have i already said, that i HATE it when posting disappear before they are
    posted? \r\nwell, typing again...\r\n\r\nthanks for your comments!\r\ni made some
    changes (concentrating on the \"3\"-series). i got rid of the gradients (they
    were not intended for the \"plain\" version). i also tweaked the font a bit, changed
    the \"e\" ... finally added the \".com\"  reference.\r\ni am not quite sure about
    the colour altogether. i try to avoid a too serious/conservative look (like banks
    or financial service companies). the pepsi-look, as coupdegrace pointed out accurately
    is also bad, i'd rather it looked a bit \"old school\".\r\n\r\nanyway, thanks
    for your opinion again\r\nrdnzl[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_3940.jpg]"

  body: "as i work in the print section, i liked to display this in the logo as well.
    although i haven't got rid of the ligature (yet), this my new effort, making the
    traingles more vibrant, not so stativ and crest-like. (tried the yellow/blue combination
    first)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ddd_6050.jpg]"

    Is it a virtual studio_? Also the word \u201CStudio\u201D is looking too tight
    to me. You may try balancing your whites and the blacks in \u201CStudio Zett\u201D.\r\n\r\nAlso
    try making the sides parallel to each other where the colored blocks are overlapping.
