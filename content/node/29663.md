  stop getting upset everytime I see free copies of quality fonts. I mean it\u2019s
  just to browse some of the free fonts sites, and it wont take any more than a minute
  until you find a lot of well known fonts with a new name!\r\n\r\nShouldn\u2019t
  it be a good idea if there was an easy way to report these crimes to the right person
  who can take action immedietly?\r\n\r\nMaybe a list of names and e-mail adresses
  to the right person at the Foundry that have released the original font, or their
  legal department. Or some kind of organisation protecting \"our rights\". Well,
  I dont have the recipy for that but the whole thing bugs the hell out of me.\r\n\r\nI
  hate to see ony of my future fonts as a free download at one of these stupid website.
  And there a lot of them out there.\r\n\r\nCos, if actions are taken harder, maybe
  some of these free sites will shut down for good or at least keep a better control
  of what kind of fonts are submitted there by pirates.\r\n\r\nOr is it just a dream?
  Is it impossible to stop?"

    you can see, [[piracy]] is a real problem and no real clear-cut solution. "

  body: There are plenty of easy ways to report copyright crimes. But unless the person
    being reported is selling large volumes of discs full of thousands of fonts, and
    unless the companies that made the fonts want to cooperate with law enforcement
    and criminal prosecutors, nothing is going to come of it. Of the criminal acts
    that occur in the world on a daily basis, font piracy is one of the least heinous,
    and law-enforcement types have bigger fish to fry.

  body: "Although it's not worth getting too angry and not possible to do much legally,
    one thing that can work is bypassing the formal/legal system and leveraging human
    decency instead: alerting the people distributing the illegal font, and suggesting
    they please pull it. Often they have no idea, and sometimes they do but just need
    a little nudge (but not threats - that backfires pretty much every time). This
    is preferably done by the \"owner\" of the font (as long as they don't get too
    emotional) so I think the idea of having a list of specific people to contact
    at the various foundries/houses has merit.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "\"Is it impossible to stop?\"\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know if I'd
    call this piracy. That typically involves an entity specifically profitting from
    your work. This is more akin to patent/copyright infringment.\r\n\r\nThe easiest
    way to stop that is to just whip off an email to the offending sites web hosting
    company.\r\n\r\n"

    The penalties are civilian, not prosecution.
