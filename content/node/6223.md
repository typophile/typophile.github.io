body: i pulled this out of a dumpster behind my office when the TrakAuto closed. i
  got an A and a U as well. not sure what it is, but it looks like Avant Garde Gothic
  with some obliques mixed in there, but i have a feeling its a different font with
  alternates used. <BR><a href="http://www.traphik.com/pics/bigt.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.traphik.com/pics/bigt.jpg</a>

    Talk about having that in your room... &#40;drool&#41; <BR> <BR>Ladies, I&#39;ve
    noticed that all the men have these photographs where they emanate various degrees
    of coolness &#40;or restrict themselves to a typographic fleuron&#41; whereas
    I haven&#39;t seen any female picture yet. Are we really SO vain? <BR> <BR>BTW
    I still haven&#39;t found any for myself yet where I look cool enough... ;&#41;
    <BR> <BR>PS Hey, what&#39;s with the fake link in my disguised swear word?! &#40;Pardon
    my French&#41;. I didn&#39;t do that!

  body: thanks guys for the help. but does anyone know who makes a version of avante
    garde with those alternates? and yves, i was unlucky enough to not be there when
    they threw the signage down into the dumpster, all the plexiglass was broken.
    itd be really cool if it lit up with the plastic in front. and i really wanted
    the &#39;O&#39; but it wouldn&#39;t fit in a civic hatchback. if only they used
    a condensed typeface...

  body: me &amp; my boss were wondering the same thing the other day. everyone has
    avant garde, but those alternates and ligatures are slightly more difficult to
    find. i admit, i only looked at myfonts and philsfonts, but hey, i had stuff to
    do. so. does anyone know?

    forum</a>. Skip all those other lame posts and go to  <BR>the one by me. <BR>
    <BR>The short story is that it can be found in FontShop&#39;s  <BR>FontBook so
    they must offer it for sale. But I won&#39;t visit the <BR>heinous <a href="http://www.fontshop.com"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontshop.com</a> unless you pay me. <BR> <BR>&#40;Hmm,

  body: This logo is made out of zipatone dry transfers circa 1980-82, i still have
    many of those. i wonder if they still work! the ss lig of this alphabet is simply
    wonderful if you could have the chance to see it. the whole thing was always like
    wow! <BR> <BR>If this typeface wasn&#39;t released as the default font in programs
    like CorelDraw it would very probably be better recognized as a staple of the
    late 70s <BR> <BR>Avant Garde&#39;s many weights and characters were big hits
    back then, along with Serif Gothic, which also used to have this hard-to-find
    xtra ligs and an ultra heavy weight. <BR>i was in high school then.... <BR> <BR>oh

    website obscure your opinion of FontShop. It&#39;s &#40;was?&#41; a brilliant
    forward-thinking organization and they did a lot for the type-loving digital community.
    <BR> <BR>ITC Avant garde Gothic with Alternates is available from &#40;Mannesmann&#41;
    Scangraphic. If you don&#39;t find it online, try your local FontShop. <BR> <BR>And

    in fact. The FontBook is the  <BR>most useful specimen book ever produced. It
    is because I <BR>am so impressed by the organization that I&#39;m disappointed

    on the FontBook. It helps me find typefaces for 90% of the cases, and I refer
    to it more frequently than Rookledge&#39;s. Can you point me to any other useful
    &#34;type finders&#34;? I know for a fact I need to get hold of P22&#39;s Indie
    Fonts catalogue.
