body: Hi, wise people. Someone here knows what is the dangerous fringe size of kb
  in a otf file, to avoid problems? How is the good proportion between number of gliphs
  and kb? The case is which I am updating more and more the Penabico. Now it have
  almost 1900 gliphs and 1.812 kb.

    file-size I've seen is about 55MB.

  body: <a href="http://trixiefont.com">Trixie</a> HD Pro Heavy is 16MB. It can slow
    things down, but behaves normally otherwise.

  body: 'If I remember well, Arial has 22MB. My preoccupation is : Is a 4MB open type
    featured font more dangerous than a 8MB non open-type featured ? If a true type
    font with thousands of gliphs works well, one open-type with multiple programming
    maybe dont works so well. I am concerning too because my font seems to has much
    kb, in comparison with simmilar fonts, considering the proportion between number
    of gliphs and total MBs'

  body: I want mean problems like did slow the system where the font is running. Or,
    for example, a crash (hypothetical, I never see one) in the use of the font. Does
    exists limit about the number of interations in the open type programming? Sometimes,
    some fonts don't works well in CorelDraw, for example. The size of the otf file
    is not a problem in this case? I dont' know, my feeling is something hard to explain,
    something like a fear to grow up a font into it don't work like before, when it's
    was plus small

  body: "There are a number of different factors that can increase the byte size of
    a font significantly, independent of something obvious like the number of glyphs
    in a font. One is the UPM size: the higher the UPM value, the greater the number
    of coordinates that will involve 3 or 4 digit values instead of 2 or 3 digit values,
    ergo a more bytes. Another is outline complexity, i.e. the number of points used
    to define the outlines: more points equals more bytes. Another is the number and
    complexity of OpenType Layout lookups.\r\n\r\nWhat matters in all these cases,
    in terms of functionality, is not the byte size of the font but the processing
    that have to be applied, e.g. rasterising a complex outline or performing iterative
    contextual GPOS positioning lookups, and how these fast these processes can be
    performed.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the kind of processing memory limitations
    that would once have made some of this issues critical have been resolved through
    increased computing power and optimisation of processes. As an example, when Adobe
    first digitised Jovica Veljovic's Ex Ponto typeface in Type 1 format, they had
    to spend a lot of time figuring out how to be true to the complexity of the design
    while not overloading the capabilities of the raster imaging machines of the time.
    This would not be an issue today because so much more processing memory is available.
    As another example, when I made the first version of the SBL Hebrew font it was
    incredibly slow in e.g. Word because of the number of contextual GPOS lookups
    for Biblical Hebrew, but Microsoft were able to optimise the Uniscribe layout
    engine code in the next release of Windows and Office, and the font worked 20
    times faster.\r\n\r\nI doubt if you are hitting anything that I would consider
    a dangerous threshold.\r\n\r\nAs for CorelDraw..."

  body: Thanks Hudson. I'm calmer now. I already suspected which the number of points
    is a parcel of the equation. Like the font in case is a script, I am working in
    a overall revision to cut the excess of points,while I make new gliphs
