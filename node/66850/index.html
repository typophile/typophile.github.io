Greetings...
This is the sign on the side of my brother's boat. We want the website to match, but I can't figure out what the heck font it is.

It is a little cartoonish. The letters are connected, as in cursive. The lower case "a" is closed loop, very unusual. The uppercase "S" is very odd, with a thick, rounded head, and the top and bottom are different. The upper case "C" has a vertical stroke on the top. Weird.

I am beginning to think that it was simple hand painted. But it is in more than one place on the boat. So how did the artist reproduce this?

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the "Ch rt rs" is pretty clearly from Comic Sans (that C is a giveaway), but the rest is something else entirely.

hmm... It looks like a vector effect may have been applied to soften the whole thing up a bit too.</div>

I'm sorry, but I would seriously consider starting

I'm saying this because I want to help, not bash!

A quick google lead me to your website (I think),
and what you have there is much better, in fact
everything is better than comic sans.

So please reconsider :)

Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Surely "Charters" was constructed later using the only available letters from the other words (a and e).
A better service to your brother would be track down the original (or more similar than Comic Sans, anyway)* typeface for "Sadie Sea" and rewrite all.

* look at the coincidence:

		<div class="commentbody">Hey... no offense taken. I didn't create it. It came with the boat.

You guys crack me up with how much you hate it. Perhaps we can place it in a trophy case on this site as the worst typeface ever seen. I'd be cool with that. I would find it rather amusing.

And yes, I redid the logo on the website with another font. But my brother was hoping I could use the original (which is where this image came from).

Perhaps his customers won't notice that the typeface on the hull is different that the typeface on the website. I'll tell him to serve them lots of rum and tell them they are drunk if they bring it up.

		<div class="commentbody">Ah Ha! I had a dream last night and it struck me as to where I have seen that "S" before. One word.... Tiki.

So I Googled "Tiki Fonts" this morning. Check out the words "Saltwater Taffy" here:
http://www.curtshellerpublications.com/images/font/HouseIndustries-Tiki.png
Not exact, but closer. That "S" shares that same unsymmetrical attribute.

I found this on the Trader Vic's website.
http://www.tradervicsgourmet.com/images/homepic_title.jpg
It has the cursive, and the simple looped lowercase "a". The "d" matches.

Here there is a font that is pretty close.
http://www.coconutinfo.com/macosxfonts.html
Look at Pilaki Font. And it has a little background on the font: "Based on the 'modern' scripts of Robert E. Smith (1940s), Pilaki's brush-written characteristics, although fairly common, remain popular. It's jazzy yet informal, and best of all has all Hawaiian pronunciation markings. You'll want its casual looks for advertising and sales since it's great for posters and signs."

I think I am getting closer... haven't found it exactly yet. What do you all thing? Am I getting warm?</div>
