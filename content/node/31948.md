body: "Anyone know where I can get a Cooper Black generic milk carton? I've seen this
  in numerous movies and TV shows. I realize this a bit strange but I thought perhaps
  someone here would know where I could find one. Most people I've talked to don't
  know what Cooper Black is so I thought I'd ask here. I hope someone can help. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n

    stopped making them that way.

  body: 'How embarassing! (My face is about as red as the Typophile logo) I just assumed
    and I guess I know what that makes me. The sad part is I really should have known
    better. I still want to find that carton though. Anybody here in props? '
