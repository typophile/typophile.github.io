  have a quick question hopefully a topshot typographer expert can get back to me
  asap.\r\n\r\nCan anyone give me some examples of typical fonts from the 1920's?\r\nIve
  been searching about, but they're very broad, and I'm finding it difficult in narrowing
  it down to about 5, or so.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\nThanks."

    the \u2018Typographic Education\u2019 forum. On typophile, there are several <a
    href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums\">forums</a>. I think this topic would
    rather fit into the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forum/5\">Design board</a>,
    as it doesn\u2019t deal with educational concerns. \r\n\r\nWhat kind of application
    are you looking for? Newspaper fonts, (urban) display fonts, book typography?\r\nWhat
    place and culture, United States? Prohibition and Al Capone? Jazz, Swing, Broadway?
    Art Deco, Art Nouveau or expressionism?\r\nNarrowing this down might help us.\r\n\r\nYou
    can always browse font vendor sites for keywords, like:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/1920s/\r\n\r\nF"

    earlier than we thought they were.\r\n\r\nI believe:\r\n\r\nGill Sans\r\nFutura\r\n
    *possibly* Cooper\r\n\r\nwere designed in the 1920's, although they didn't gain
    momentum till they were used for a while.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for typefaces
    that were popular in the 1920's, you'd have to look for typefaces that were designed
    much much earlier.  Due to the technology of the time, they could make for quick
    and easy distribution like we can with digital downloads the day after they're
    created."
