  body: "In looking through a print-out of Future style fonts I did many years ago,
    I found a set called Metro, which has a lot of weights and styles that both parts
    could be made from. But when I tried googling it, I only found a could other Metro's
    which were different. One was by Bob Simonson who posts here. Since it had the
    same name as one of his, maybe he'd know the source.\r\n\r\nI no longer have it,
    sorry to say. It might have come on some clipart package that bundles fonts.\r\n\r\n"

    the Font Pavilion series which was sold by P22 and is not available now, I guess.
    Anyone from P22 with any words of wisdom?\r\nIt's not the exact font, but close
    enough matches to do both fairly nicely.\r\n\r\n> Yup, I think we all noticed
