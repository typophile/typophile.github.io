  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m working on a personal photography web site project, in my spare time, so it&rsquo;s unlikely it will be out anytime soon, but nevertheless I&rsquo;d like it to have recognizable identity.</p>
<p>I’d like to put couple of personal collections, like seascapes (examples 1 and 2), subtle suburban shoots (example 3), there’s one nostalgic grunge collection I’m working on, etc. and there’s one ongoing project I’m working on with local photo club that includes on location people shoots like example 4 (it should be interesting locations and use of external strobes).</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/example1_3731.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/example2_4647.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/example3_6693.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/example4_6130.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m attaching the logo I like best of those I’ve played with until now (so far i like light gray, blue, orange combo):
<img src="/images/old-images/identity_5536.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also played with logo from letters GZ, I&rsquo;ll post best what I came up until now (by my opinion) a little later, because I don&rsquo;t have it with me right now.</p>
<p>I’d like the logo, type and color used to say:
vision in photography (hence my idea for the stylized eye)
urban
art
professional (as in high quality)
grunge (eyelashes and pupil on the eye are sort of grungy to communicate that)
positive (by the use of blue, green colors, maybe put pupil in orange for accent).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to attract young crowd.</p>
<p>I was looking for type that would not be to strict, but not too loose either, and that has sort of &ldquo;artsy&rdquo; feel to it (possibly countered by word &ldquo;photography&rdquo; in sans serif). You can see on the logo what I thought might be a good idea, but I&rsquo;d really like more input from experienced people.</p>
<p>Any help and input appreciated!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What a broad amount of things to convey in a poor single little logo! ;-)
The overall composition isn’t bad (which it’s not easy given the many different elements. I suppose being a photographer helps :-)
Some random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would revise the colour palette (they seems too many and don’t blend well together). Also, if you think of the logo in a portfolio website, too many colours could distract away from the photographs.</li>
<li>I don’t like the slanted light grey “photography”. You could try an upright light (as in font weight) black version.</li>
<li>Compared with the serene samples you provided, the eye in your logo appears almost menacing&hellip;</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>lol, i have to agree with almost everything you&rsquo;ve said and suggested (last part really made me laugh).</p>
<p>I have couple of versions of the eye, actually I have one that I like more than the one posted (but it&rsquo;s not incorporated in complete logo just yet), which is indeed much less intimidating and more soothing, which should make it in tune with most of the portfolio.</p>
<p>Would it be a good idea to reduce color palette to white, shade of gray and one color (I kinda prefer light green or blue)?</p>
<p>What would be the font you&rsquo;d suggest for &ldquo;photography&rdquo;, and more importantly, what about the font for name?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting adjective you&rsquo;ve mentioned, &ldquo;serene&rdquo;, really has me thinking about different concepts.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback, appreciate it!</p>

I would agree with riccard0, use 1 or 2 colors. A good idea is to make black, white and gray only versions, before colorizing. Look at it upside down too. It&rsquo;ll help you balance the shape and air around the logo. Hope that makes sense.</div>

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Look at the identity for this photographer: <a href="http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Donald-Graham-Photographer-Identity/162567">http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Donald-Graham-Photographer-Identity/162567</a></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be completely black and white, and use Helvetica, but something like that is much more subtle and clean, and gives people a much more secure feeling about who you are as a photographer.</p>

<p>Man, I gotta remember that line. Good stuff.</p>
<p>As for the logo, I think you’re heading in the right general direction, but perhaps down the wrong road. I like the simplicity, but not crazy about the type choice, super-tight letter spacing or mark.</p>
<p>Take a look at [[http://38one.com/cleverblog/kristy-harrison-wedding-photography|this photography logo I found on Google]]. I think its pretty awesome. The whole shutter/aperture thing might be overdone, but it’s geometric qualities make it well-suited for a logo, and this particular one I think was extremely well-executed.</p>
<p>Have you thought of a typeface as simple as Frutiger? Maybe something along these lines:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/photo_6369.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at your photos, something simple and contemplative seems more your style. Just a thought.</p>

<p>@epsilicon -&gt; the only difference between uppercase and lowercase in appropriate type is their weight. What you see in symbol was actually the uppercase g. I&rsquo;m not sure I wanna use this symbol. Although I could somehow workaround mouse trap, g really reminds me of handcuffs like altaira said, and if I can&rsquo;t use that g, I don&rsquo;t see the point, because it was main attraction of that symbol in the first place.</p>

<p>Those new marks are crude versions of ideas I draw on paper, or have in my head, and I&rsquo;ve found that my illustrator (I basically only now how to correctly use type and pen tool from photoshop) knowledge is way to restrictive to transform ideas to something useful.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m still liking the one from August 5th the best. It looks strong, yet with it as all lowercase it has a pleasant friendly appeal. The lowercase g looks like a subliminal smile. It&rsquo;s not really noticeable or distracting, but I like it a lot. I like how the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; of the o, g &amp; c resemble the circle of the lens/eye, so the type looks like it belongs to the mark. Nice! I like the thickness of the outer circle of the lens/eye, cause it matches the thickness of the letters. I&rsquo;d maybe play the lens/eye some more and see if you can make more resemble a camera lens. Myself, I don&rsquo;t mind it al all.</p>
<p>In the other versions, the type doesn&rsquo;t especially balance with the thickness of the mark, except maybe #8 &amp; #10. On #5 as all uppercase, the name seems to long to me for all uppercase. I think it would be painful reading on a large scale sign for your studio. Like emails &ldquo;shouting&rdquo; being all uppercase.</p>
<p>Some of the letters stand out badly to me in certain versions: The s in 3 &amp; 4, the i in 3 &amp; 9, the accents in 13 &amp; 14, the t in 14, the g in 3 &amp; 4 will look like an 8 at small sizes</p>
<p>The first zg logo is interesting, and is worth some exploring - it might not be recognizable unless you repeat or resemble those characters in the name. The gray makes it look like a hour glass to me.</p>
<p>The second looks like 29. The 3rd, well&hellip; not seeing anything.</p>

Symbol inside that is trapped inside that grey frame, that can survive pretty on its own without one or two frames with decent wordmark.</p>
<p>Name set in Futura displaying the name is too tight spaced, and photography beneath too wide, thus creating not so pleasing contrast. Photography looks to light and zlatkogudasic to thick. So that tells that there is a problem with typesetting in the beggining, selection, coloring, composition, and proportions and spacing itself generating too much contrast and negative dynamics (note too tight set nameplate, and too light and wide spaced photography).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An update on progress. Since I have a web site and portfolio to finish first, I&rsquo;ve decided that if I don&rsquo;t find something that would satisfy me, I&rsquo;ll give it a rest for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be amused to know I&rsquo;ve managed to get some unbelievable shapes combining z and g letters, including cow&rsquo;s portrait:</p>

<p>Of all the concepts I came up with, I found only two worth considering. The first one you already saw. I&rsquo;ve contacted author of type and he approved me using it in logo, which is a big plus. It&rsquo;s inspired by polaroid, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it associates on it. I also have to say I don&rsquo;t agree with type weight critique, since I&rsquo;ve experimented with all possible combinations, and this one seemed to do the trick (and it was deliberate juxtaposition). I&rsquo;ve also tried printing it, and it&rsquo;s legible, and for web 100 and 200 px version seems fine too (without words).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this other concepts, and tell me what you think about it:</p>

		<div class="commentbody">i agree with microspective, i think the bottom row of your previous post is very promising and original and have much more personality than the other one.
The rounded box version make me think of a iPhone apps icon IMHO.
But i am also very impress by your persistantce, keep digging!! :)</div>
