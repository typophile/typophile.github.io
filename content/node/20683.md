body: "I'm been a magazine designer for 15 years, but never feel like I've gotten
  the body typeface right when desiging a new magazine.  I'm about to start design
  a magazine for a small college, and I really want to get a body typeface that works
  this time and has a bit of style to it.\r\n\r\nNot looking for anything radical,
  and it must be very readable, must have all the features of a good body font-available
  in several weights, well kerned, etc, but something with a little flair would be
  great.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty small budget, so there isn't a ton to spend on a
  custom typeface or anything, but we enough to buy something new, and not have to
  rely on the old standby's that I have in my type library.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear
  people's suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-J"

    <a href=\"http://FontBureau.com/\">Fontbureau</a> are the biggest suppliers of
    fonts to magazines in the US. It would be worth browsing through them to see what
    captures your fancy. Call them and talk to them as well; I'm sure they will give
    you interesting options. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Today we are officially beginning the redesign process on a magazine. I am
    presenting Stefan\u2019s Delicato and Anziano as body text contenders, and his
    Stalemate as a sans for the book. Take a good look at Delicato and Anziano\u2014they
    are extremely well designed. Very readable and at the same time, elegant."

  body: "As a graphic designer of large publications, I can't suggest what sort of
    font is best in your case (hehe. no pun), but at least make sure it has a small
    caps :(. IE: it's a large family. \r\n\r\nMaybe use a neo-slab serif for heads
    and any post modern large font family that is legible and readible at caption
    size too. (7-9 pts)"
