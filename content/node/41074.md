body: "Hello all. I'm new to this site and I've read through lots of posts and couldn't
  find anything specific to my question, so here it is.\r\n\r\nI want to create a
  new font that is very similar to and existing font. I can base it off of a font
  that I do own a lisence to or start from scratch. When I'm finished it will closely
  resemble a font that is just too expensive to purchase. And I don't really want
  to change fonts. So basically I want to copy a font, make some minor changes so
  it's not exact, then use this new font in the old one's place. Please refrain from
  belting me with rotten tomatoes and cabbage, I'm really just looking for the legalities
  involved with this type of thing. Like for instance, can one build a font that looks
  almost exactly like trade gothic, maybe not even using the original, then call it
  their own? \r\n\r\nOr, say I create a new font from scratch and it's exactly like
  garamond, but i've never seen garamond, are their legal issues?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  all your help, you all seem like a very intelligent and resourceful group.\r\n\r\nMario"

    and or add more characters.\r\n\r\nWhat you can't and shouldn't do is start by
    using someone else's font and make your own. Ethically speaking, whether you start
    from the actually font file or if you  print it out, either way, you are on shaky
    ground. \r\n\r\nJust because a font is too expensive is not a good reason to do
    it. Consider the time you will spend to create the font. How much is your time
    worth? Add to that any legal woes you might have should you step on someone's
    toes. Now is it less expensive to actually license the font?"

  body: "Legally, there are (at least) two points to consider:\r\n\r\n1) Font/Typeface
    NAMES can be (and are) protected by copyrights. Many names you see over and over
    again are older, and may be in the public domain, but most are owned/licensed
    by existing foundries.\r\n\r\n2) Font/Typeface DIGITAL data (or, in legal parlance,
    the \"font program\") CAN be (and is) protected by copyright. This means you can't
    take an existing font file, rename it, and then distribute or sell it (without
    permission).\r\n\r\nThe rest is murky... most font designs are \"based on\" some
    existing design(s)... after all, there are only 26 basic letterforms, and they
    have to look somewhat alike or no one would ever be able to read them. And designers
    have been \"copying\" fonts since before Guttenberg... it's just the technology
    that's changed. I think the current \"legal\" rule of thumb would be: if you create
    (draw from scratch) a font, even if it visually references an existing font, WITHOUT
    directly \"copying\" it, and give it a unique/unlicensed name, you're o.k."

  body: Thanks Scott. Thats kind of what I suspected. I commend you on your Letterform
    and Guttenberg references too! Not many people know that type of info. I personally
    love typography history, it's the legal I am a little foggy on.

  body: "Good points, Scott. \r\n\r\nI should mention I'm not a lawyer. Just a person
    who has spent too much time reading font EULAs.\r\n\r\nIf you create a font from
    scratch and it resembles another font and it is for personal use only (and you
    aren't using their font in any way, shape, or form; and you don't intend to sell
    it) you are probably OK. But, if you plan to sell the font in any way I'd suggest
    getting a lawyer first. "

    off-list so as not to expose your idea? If not, I understand.

  body: "Scott - there's usually always a line in the EULA that says reverse engineering
    is not permitted. That basically means you are not allowed to modify the data
    without permission.\r\nYour best bet is to contact the owner of the software and
    explain what you want to do. Most foundries will allow custom modifications if
    they get paid to make the modification (they may just give you permission) and
    you are covered in terms of licensing the original software. Of course the modified
    font must be for your own use only and can not be resold.\r\n\r\nIf you're drawing
    from scratch it doesn't matter what it looks like (although there is the issue
    of moral rights), you must avoid using names that are trademarked if you intend
    to resale.\r\n\r\nDon't quote me on any of this. Always use a lawyer."

    European countries recognize copyright on the abstract design of a typeface as
    well, but only for some typefaces.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
