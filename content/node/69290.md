body: "Hey, i'm working on  a logo for a youthgroup called Blueprint. This is my latest
  idea, simply a B cut into the ground with a hidden P. The only criteria was to make
  it stamped. Just looking for any input or critique,\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

  body: without more actual information on the organization it's hard to really give
    you input. Though I do like it. But for a youthgroup I think it may be a little
    to conservative without knowing more about the actual org.

  body: Good point, I was thinking with the less conservative the posters/flyers etc
    it'd go one, it would stand out and be recognisable. Also i didn't want to take
    a patronising hip youth angle with it as they are 14-18year olds. But i'm just
    a student so please correct me if i'm wrong

  body: I added a ledge around the bottom of the B, does that help. Can't really think
    of any other ways than a gradient or maybe white lines being triangles, any ideas?

  body: "just tried thickening, it doesn't look bad but I think the idea of the white
    lines being the corners of the indent is lost.\r\n\r\nWHat do you guys think of
    the ledge along the bottom?\r\n\r\nalso how do you upload the images to you post?
    i can only get them to work up top\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Blueprint-Logo+ledge_4300.jpg]"

    this. Do you mean something like <a href=http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/53162>this</a>?"

  body: "I think the first one is the better looking.\r\nI agree with Tomi: you can
    just drop the (albeit clever, but not so discernible) \"cut in the ground\" idea,
    and go for a visually pleasing shape instead."
