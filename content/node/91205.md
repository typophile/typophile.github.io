    the second V (the first looks like a U) and I suggest you work that tasty diagonal
    into more letters.

    http://www.flickr.com/photos/80643375@N00/with/271157756/\r\n\r\nAnd quite suited
    for a didone treatment. I dare say you'll find better models for the Z and W in
    the sources, though. I don't think you need to stay as strict as you are to the
    geometric grid either."

    makes it look like it's be good for titling perhaps. I'm having trouble imagining
    the spacing. Are you working on this in Fontlab? If so, the letters are spaced
    too wide on your first example. Have any idea if you will be designing an accompanying
    lowercase? :)\r\n\r\nI'll see if I have time to comment on the letterforms later."

  body: "Etah, good to see you're going for a public crit of this!\r\nI think it's
    pretty fascinating, especially it terms of taking\r\nsomething gritty and translating
    it to a \"classy\" idiom.\r\n\r\nI can't tell how clear the direction is in your
    head; it seems\r\na tough thing to settle on. But this has to be done before\r\nwe
    engage in much \"this glyph is better than that glyph\"\r\ntype of refinement.
    I will say however that personally I'm\r\nvery attracted to the especially strange
    structures, such\r\nas the \"E\" in your original post. You don't want to go over-\r\nboard
    with that flavor though - some letters will have to be\r\nquite tame in order
    to produce a nice contrast/balance.\r\n\r\nThe main thing I'm wondering is: How
    obscure do you\r\nwant this to be? Of course you want it to be decipherable,\r\nbut
    how much effort would you like a reader to put into\r\nactually reading text in
    it?\r\n\r\nBTW: http://luc.devroye.org/BasVaerewyck-RLF-2009.jpg\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    as to what character is represents. the main objective was to take a foreign letter
    structure to typography, and turn it into modern type. When i set this into words,
    i want it to be obvious these aren't regular typographic letters. these are letters
    from some other subculture. but the treatment of these letters, is a didone one.
    i feel like i should get these critiqued by gang member or something. \r\n"

    Preferably a former one... like the inimitable Chaz\r\nBojorquez (who spoke at
    TypeCon-LA) who happens to\r\nbe relatively accessible. On the other hand AFAIR
    he's\r\nnot big on fontifying graffiti...\r\n\r\nBTW, for inspiration on inventive

    thought of this idea, that if i studied non-latin letters, like Armenian, it would
    somehow benefit me. Because i'd only read them as shapes, and i wouldn't know
    what they meant.\r\n\r\n@1996type. thank you. any feedback is welcome."
