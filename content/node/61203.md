  body: "Hope this isn't spam-bait, as the answer is so obvious :-)\r\n\r\nPrivate
    Label... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_label \r\n\r\n\"Private label products
    or services are typically those manufactured or provided by one company for offer
    under another company's brand.\"\r\n\r\nSo its designing a product that can have
    another company\u2019s logo slapped on it - Apple, Wal-Mart, Halliburton or whatever,
    rather than designing a product specifically for a brand.  \r\n"

  body: "Ahahaha wow do i feel stupid now... \r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nI googled it at
    work and most of the \"good\" websites are blocked, so I didn't find wiki's page.
    I just got out of school, so I don't really know what anything means. I figured
    that would be like... the store brands of stuff so like target's line of stuff
    for it's own store, but I wanted to be sure....\r\n\r\n\r\nbut i still feel like
    an idiot."
