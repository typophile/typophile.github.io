body: "Hi \r\nI'm working on a complex arabic typeface with different weights and
  all of the kerning and mark positioning stuff are done in VOLT. I was wondering
  is there any utility to interpolate between two VOLT project files. I remember sometime
  ago there was a website that would do this, you could upload the files and just
  specify the percent of interpolation. anyone remember this website? if not, is there
  any workaround for me to interpolate the kerning pairs? please notice that kerning
  data are done in VOLT.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Since the VOLT lookup files can be exported in a text format, I'm sure it
    would be possible to write scripts to manipulate those text files in all sorts
    of ways.

  body: On the Typotheque website there was once an online tool (2007) where you uploaded
    two VOLT projects, input the instance you wanted, and it would generate that for
    you! Alas, my link to that page leaders to a 404 error now, and a search on their
    website leads to no trace of it. Perhaps they only use it internally now.

  body: Or maybe it wasn't VOLT projects, but just look just lookups, which would
    make much more sense! Anyway, it seems to be gone.

    I noticed that, but I'm not a programmer, Is there anyway to manipulate data in
    excel like David mentioned?\r\n\r\nDan:<blockquote> On the Typotheque website

    is something I can do about it, like get a time machine or so!\r\n"
