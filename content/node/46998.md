  body: I think this is custom lettering. The closest I can get is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/neuzeit_s_std_complete_vp/?sample_text=Grant%20Thornton">Neuzeit
    S</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/avenir_std_65_medium/?sample_text=Grant%20Thornton">Avenir</a>.

  body: "Hmm...\r\n\"rant Thornton\" might be Avenir 55. No idea where that \"G\"
    came from, but i think it looks too thin for the rest of the wordmark (and generally
    at odds with it)."
