    were in fact American designs. He had been living and working in America for 15
    years at the time he designed them, and they were commissioned and published by
    an American company."

  body: "I generally think of Gotham as a genuinely American typeface. It's based
    off of American industrial lettering, created by an American type designer, and
    is now ubiquitous in American advertising.\r\n\r\nAlso, Century Schoolbook has
    some sort of uniquely American quality about it, perhaps because I remember it
    from books when I was a child."
