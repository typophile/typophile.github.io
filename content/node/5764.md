body: hi there, <BR> <BR>i&#39;m currently working on a project for TV.  <BR>task
  is to design a form full of text information. <BR>I&#39;m wondering what are the
  most-suitable typefaces for broadcast. I tried Univers, Helvetica, but its not very
  good in terms of legebility. Those font that work best on screen dont work on TV.
  I&#39;m thinking if i should go for FF meta, FF info? whatelse should i try? <BR>please
  name a few... <BR> <BR>appreciate your help <BR> <BR> <BR>

    It was designed for legibility on television.

  body: 'I made fonts for MS WEB-TV in 1998. <BR> <BR>Fonts should have 2 pixel wide
    features, stems, counters or serifs and spaces between letters. If they are one
    pixel they will be lost in most cases due to the line scans and blur.  <BR> <BR>Bigger
    size and bold is better.  <BR>Colours: No pure Black on pure White... causes visable
    movemnet and noise.  <BR> <BR>Use Anti-aliasing or anti-flicker filters to smooth
    out the colours so the gun doesn&#39;t cause noise or spikes. ie... going from
    full OFF to FULL on is bad that&#39;s why pure black and pure white are bad.  <BR>
    <BR>Our fonts were manually tuned and use Windows CE and Windows anti-aliasing,
    plus an additional filter for antiflicker.  <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: Some would argue that Tiresias is the only way to go, as it was designed with
    these very limitations in mind. <BR> <BR>Joe Clark, the undisputed expert in this
    particular field, would probably say that the current state of television-font
    affairs is in an atrocious way &#40;check it all out at joeclark.org&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Of course some people will let Helvetica and Univers pass muster for these
    sorts of jobs--but Tiresias will probably be your best bet.
