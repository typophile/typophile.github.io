  body: Okay, this is not as easy as it seems. As far as I  <BR>can tell, the logo
    is NOT Futura with a customized  <BR>tail on the Q &#40;bowl of the R extends
    too much to the  <BR>right&#41;, but more something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/avantgarde-demi/testdrive.html?s=ORIO&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> ITC Avant Garde Gothic</a>.  <BR>I&#39;ll have to dig a bit,
    unless someone else comes up  <BR>with the ID before I come back from lunch break.
