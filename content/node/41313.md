  use Vag Rounded. I seem to be using this more and more with clients and would like
  to have something similar, but a little different.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anybody
  could throw any ideas in the air as to what alternatives there could be to Vag Rounded.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot.\r\n\r\nJames"

    target=\"_blank\">Omnes</a>', by Joshua Darden, and, 'Gotham Rounded', by H&FJ.

    to. Nothing else comes close to its elegance in this genre, IMO.

    Cooke's G-Type Chevin]], [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_speak_ot/|FF
    Speak]] or [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Isonorm|Elsner+Flake Isonorm]].
    Another great one would have been [[http://www.ge.com/|GE Insipira]] but you certainly
    know this is a General Electric custom proprietary font, so not available...

    appears that i could have posted this topic in the wrong category and could have
    used Typowiki which to be honest, not being a regular user, i didnt know existed.
    So apologies for all these mistakes, will do better next time. :)\r\n\r\nJames"
