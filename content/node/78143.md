body: "My new project, a compact, solidly constructed realist sans serif that draws
  its influences from Germany.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen_shot_2011-02-20_at_12_5574.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen_shot_2011-02-20_at_12-1_5146.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
  only got one weight right now (hopefully over time I'll make this a large font family
  with 6 or 7 weights).  I'd love some help getting the rhythm and consistency just
  right.  I can spend hours just focused on one glyph, so it's hard to remember sometimes
  how crucial rhythm, weight and color are as well.  \r\n\r\nI just built it from
  scratch in 48 hours, but any input would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTB\r\n\r\n\r\n!

  body: "First of all, let me start of by saying this: I said that it's a good start
    because I have seen your progress here on typophile. It still needs A LOT of changes
    and it'll probably look a whole lot different when you're done. You have to realise
    that there's a good chance that you'll be working on this for a year, or even
    longer, before you reach a decent quality. However, that's where we all start,
    so don't stop working on it! I'm no profesional myself, so take it with a grain
    of salt.\r\n\r\nInstead of telling you what looks 'wrong' to me for each glyph,
    I will just give you some basic advise, as I think that's a much better way learn
    it. All advise is based on my personal experience. In a later stadium I might
    come back here and give you some more specific critique.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Keep it
    simple. There are lots of unnecessary bends and twists in it.\r\n\u2014 Trust
    your eye, not maths. It's the only way to get a better trained eye. This doesn't
    mean you should stop measuring. I see quite a lot of inconsistencies in stroke
    thickness. Once everything is mathematically correct (all horizontals same thickness/positioning
    + all verticals same thickness) you should use your eyes to make it visually correct.
    \r\n\u2014 Focus on the lowercase for now. They're easier to work out because
    you use and see them more often around you.\r\n\u2014 Try out every possible change
    that you see in comparable fonts or just comes into your mind, before dismissing
    it.\r\n\u2014 Look at existing fonts with similar characteristics and don't be
    too afraid of getting a similar design. Officina, Din, Meta, etc.\r\n\u2014 It's
    quite hard to focus on every aspect of the typeface at the same time, so I suggest
    this order. You might want to change it, but this is how I did it.\r\n\r\n1. Basic
    shape of letters\r\n2. Width of letters\r\n3. Stroke thickness\r\n4. specific
    letter combinations\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n"

  body: Your vertical strokes in general appear to be too thick (compared to horizontals
    and diagonals), and still somewhat inconsistent. Compare the stem of the capital
    'I' to the lowercase 'i', compare the stem of the 'K' to its diagonals, compare
    the vertical strokes of the 'M' to its diagonals, etc.

    Once you understand that principle, you can then anticipate you''ll have to make

    more of the irregularities, it will strip away the 'human' or 'organic' qualities,
    and will just end up being a boringly constructed sans serif.  But maybe it's
    better off that way, I'll definitely give it a try.\r\n\r\nI've also tried creating
    a slab version of Edin, and it looks great!  It has more square corners, like
    you suggested.  I'll post an image/pdf of that soon."

  body: "Looking better and better.\r\n\r\nStill some weight inconsistencies \u2014
    most noticeably in the lowercase 'i'. It seems rather dark when you compare it
    to the stems of some of the other characters. This is most likely due to the way
    the bar joins the top of the stem as well as the bottom curve.\r\n\r\nThe cap
    'J' looks heavy as well. I think it's mostly how far the top bar sticks out along
    with its bluntness (it's not tapered like the ones on lowercase 'i' and 'j').\r\n\r\nYour
    cap 'T' also looks too high. It's clearly higher than the cap 'R' that it's next
    to in the PDF.\r\n\r\nOh and by the way, my earlier post stating: <cite>Generally
    speaking vertical strokes are going to look heavier than horizontals.</cite> \u2014
    dead wrong. It's actually the opposite . . . brain was not functioning properly

    The top of t should be horizontally flipped and the overall typeface looks a little

  body: Jasper, do you think that's a result of the kerning, or just the tall x-height
    and ascenders?  I wanted the typeface to be a bit compact, so that it could be
    usable on the web and could display a large amount of information in restrictive
    spaces, while still remaining legible.  Do you think it's too condensed?  Maybe
    this could be Edin Condensed, and I can make a regular version with more extended
    characters.

    compared to others. Right foot of lowercase 'n' needs fine tuning, the slight
    curve in it looks off, could you try matching it with the lowercase 'h' where
    everything is dead straight? Same case with the 'u' I suppose you mirrored it?\r\n\r\nRunning
    text appears a bit jumpy, it might be a rendering issue but I suggest you check
    your alignment zone and make sure everything is lined up properly.\r\n\r\n Looking

  body: I'm not saying it's TOO condensed. It's just condensed. I think optimizing
    text for web use requires a lot experience and knowledge, so I think it would
    be best to focus on print use. The condensedness is simply the result of designing
    the glyphs quite narrow. The spacing is also a bit tight though. Compare uppercase
    and lowercase glyphs to each other and try to make all stroke endings look like
    they have the same thickness. The bottom ending of c and C looks too thick for
    example.
