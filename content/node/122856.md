  Many sources label them only as modern. Like here:\r\nhttp://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/type_basics/modern.htm\r\n\r\nBut
  \"modern\" is a quite wide classification. Today many new fonts are inspired by
  Bodoni and to label them all as modern is just blunt.\r\n\r\n# Sorry if this question
  already exists in the forum, but there is no advanced search function so I can't
  find any matching thread."

      As I am a bit of a classist myself :)\r\n\r\nAnd Scotch modern was really beautiful!
