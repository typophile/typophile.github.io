  body: It's pretty uncommon in lowercase. I can't think of any other typefaces that

    expect Caslon Antique too be so unique! ;-)\r\n<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/SCHQ/F_SCHQ-10005300.html\">Stempel
    Schneidler Italic</a> comes with a nice overlapping lc w, as well. I love it for
    having that feature\u2014while, unfortunately, its extravagant question mark threatens
    to spoil the party."
