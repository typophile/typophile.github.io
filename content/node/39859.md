  but had a sudden idea I wanted to play with.\r\n\r\nI've been working for two days
  now on <em>Metraux</em>, a display typeface based on the following requirements:\r\n\r\n-
  Starts with a geometric basis similar to Futura\r\n- Low crossbars on the caps\r\n-
  Wedge serifs (exterior only)\r\n- Noitcably low x-height\r\n- A few other idiosyncrasies
  here and there\r\n\r\nThere's still some work to be done on the overall color, and
  I have quite a bit of work ahead of me in terms of kerning and such (which is HIDEOUSLY
  hacked at this point, so pay it no mind), but the stylistic idea is definitely there."

  body: "I really like a lot of what I see here, although it reminds me more of Eric
    Gill than Paul Renner. But I take issue with some uses of the exterior only serifs.
    I\u2019m not entirely sure it\u2019s that they\u2019re exterior only as it is
    that they\u2019re symmetrical, both horizontally and vertically. The serifs just
    seem tacked on at the top of <strong>a</strong> and as the ear of <strong>g</strong>.
    I think that playing with them would really make this a strong face and add in
    the idiosyncrasies you speak of.\r\n\r\nOther things:\r\n\r\n\u2022Using the serifs
    as the crossbar on <strong>t</strong> creates a down arrow, and it\u2019s a distraction.\r\n\u2022A
    two-story <strong>a</strong> would go better with the three-story g.\r\n "

  body: I agree with most of what you're saying. I totally understand the down-arrow
    commment on the t, as well as the comment about the stories on the a vs. g, but
    in both cases I have to say I just personally like the look as-is, even though
    I can't really defend it on any rational level. :) I'll have an update soon.
