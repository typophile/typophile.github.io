  body: "Thanks guys, yeah i think it is letter gothic, I'm guessing they customized
    the uppercase \"A\" in the title....the lowercase letters in the word \"and\"
    didn't look correct (the bowl of the lowercase \"a\"), but I think that just pixel
    smooshing due to the resolution. Cheers,\r\nm"
