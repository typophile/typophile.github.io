  body: "The current branding says 90s all the way.\r\n\r\nThe Greek style type and
    the colour palette are dated. \r\n\r\nThe icon itself has potential if paired
    with a typeface that is less decorative. When using colour, I'd try to choose
    something fun like an orange or lime green OR something primary like Red or Blue. "

  body: "Agree with TkDesign,\r\nFurthermore, greek-like type does not match the icons,
    that remind me of native-american symbols, calling for a brighter/warmer palette
    (black/orange/brown). Last consideration, icon will need reworking, beacuse they
    look slightly clip-art...\r\n"

    is your letterhead design. Even then, it's all caps and all letterspaced. I think
    you need a typographic solution that condenses it into separate lines (the * represents
