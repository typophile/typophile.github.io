  and ethical practice.\r\n\r\nAIGA was founded in 1914 as a small, exclusive club,
  AIGA now represents more than 18,000 designers through national activities and local
  programs developed by 52 chapters and more than 150 student groups.\r\n\r\nAIGA
  supports the interests of professionals, educators and students who are engaged
  in the process of designing, regardless of where they are in the arc of their careers.
  The disciplines represented in the profession range from book and type design through
  the traditional communication design disciplines to the newer disciplines of interaction
  design, experience design and motion graphics.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aiga.org/\r\n"
