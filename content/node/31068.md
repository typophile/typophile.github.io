body: "I've been asked to help a town with a logo and some other design work.  The
  problem is that its in Armenia (its actually pro-bono work I am doing with my sister
  who is there in the Peace Corps).  The name of the town is STEPANAVAN (\u054D\u057F\u0565\u0583\u0561\u0576\u0561\u057E\u0561\u0576
  in Armenian if that comes through)\r\n\r\nAnyways, the logo has to be in both English
  and Armenian, and the brochure/web site have to be in English, French and Armenian.
  \ The big challenge is that Armenia has its own unique alphabet that I have barely
  seen, no less actually have a grasp on. <a href=\"http://indoeuro.bizland.com/project/script/armen.gif\">It
  looks like this...</a>\r\n\r\nSo why am I posting?  Well I need some help in selecting
  some good typefaces to start the logo. I have two main ideas for it:\r\n\r\n1) The
  Armenian alphabet is very vertical in its orientation and contains letters that
  are quite similar (even Armenians have a hard time reading it).  So I was thinking
  that the english version should reflect that - Vertical lettering, similar letters
  (especially in the anavan section, which is repetitive anyways), perhaps with some
  vertical serifs (closest I have found to a solution is Modern)\r\n\r\n2) Reference
  their communist past.  Unlike most former Soviet countries, Armenia was better off
  under communism.  They suffered a massive earthquake in 1988 and have yet to recover.
  \ So soviet/communist references are acceptable.  The town was named for a communist
  revolutionary.  So if anyone has any suggestions for appropriate faces that have
  communist/constructivist references/qualities, I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  has anyone dealt with a logo that is bi-lingual (especially with multiple alphabets)?
  \ How do I keep them balanced without being awkward (stepanavan is long enough already)."

    faces in latin that are the right style.

  body: but that's the thing, which Roman font is right depends on what Armenian font
    you're using and vice versa. Finding a typeface that has both alphabets designed
    to harmonize together is the best and easiest solution.

  body: True, but expect that I will be modifying a roman font for use in Armenian.  I
    also have zero budget for this thing, so using fonts that I already have would
    be best!

  body: What actual purpose does this branding have? You have to be clear about that
    to choose your type well. Is it for tourism? Local pride? What?

    beginning. Appropriate for both locals and your non-local target audience.\r\n\r\nAnother
    starting point: Armenian type designers\r\nManvel Shmavonyan & Henrik Mnatsankanyan
    (deceased)\r\nTypes from both should be available. \r\n\r\nI've used some from
    the second, which one North American critic felt was \"too Soviet\". So this is
    a genuine issue."

    it's not targeted at the Disney Worldesque tourist, but rather the self guided
    adventure tourist.\r\n\r\nMy role is designing the logo, and providing guidance
    for a booklet, brochure, map and web site.  The logo will also be on the information
