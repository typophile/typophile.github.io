  \r\n\r\nThis is for a corporate identity program for a hospitality group that runs
  a chain of luxury business hotels. The serif would typically be used for body text
  in applications like their in-house magazine, menus etc. \r\n\r\nThanks very much
  in advance for any help!"

  body: I did, but I wanted something slightly taller. Eventually we seem to have
    decided on DTL Paradox (if I can manage to figure out how to get things done on
    that quirky DTL online shop). Do you think that makes sense?

  body: Well, as it turned out the client baulked at the price. So any suggestion
    is still welcome for a high 'x' height font that's slightly on the expressive
    side.

  body: You might have seen the topic about [[http://www.typophile.com/node/39592|Fonts
    for bookdesign]] already, but there are alot of good suggestions in it. I know
    it says bookdesign, but most of the fonts listed obviously work for magazines
    as well. :)
