  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm working on a project at the moment that strongly references the late 1930s (in the UK)... but was surprised to discover that most of the typefaces I had in mind (Gill, Futura, Kabel etc) as characteristic of the 30s were actually designed in the 20s... clearly I needed to return to the textbooks! - but further research still didn't really turn up anything suitable from the period.

So I'd be very grateful for suggestions of (sans?) typefaces from the second half of the 30s that aren't too eccentric or deco (the project has plenty of deco ornament already), and which don't look 'historical' - ie which still look contemporary enough to pass.

Many thanks, in advance, Team Typophile :-)

		<div class="commentbody">I think Gill probably is your best choice. Although designed in the '20s it would be during the '30s that it became really common. I have British signpainting and lettering books from the '30s and late '40s in which hand drawn versions of Gill are the only example of a sans alphabet.

I guess it also depends what sort of publication you are referencing. It might only be an art or design publication from the late '30s that would be employing any very recent type designs.</div>

Type was a slower-moving industry in that era. A typeface was a pretty big investment for both the foundry and the printers who bought it, so faces released in the 20s would still have enjoyed quite a lot of exposure in the 30s.</div>

Many thanks for your replies. Your point about acceptance / application / ubiquity is judicious, and very well taken, of course there isn't a more English face on the planet, and I certainly don't need much encouragement to reach for Gill at the best of times... but I was disappointed that a period I'd always rather uncritically accepted as the dawn of modern sans-serifyness actually turns out rather light on faces. For this project, I'm very comfortable with an artier, more up to date slant on the period if you have any suggestions in that direction...

Consulting my faithful Opie scrapbook, there are lots of anonymous sans faces to be seen in common use - though i certainly grant you Gill's circular 'O' seems to have been (ahem) highly influential... or at least to have captured a zeitgeist.

Metro is, at a pinch, in period, but - sorry to display my lack of discrimination here - honestly I've always found its quirky f rather distracting... so yes, I may well end up opting for Gill, for all the reasons you recommend - but I admit I was rather hoping to have overlooked something obvious - or failing one always live in hopes of unearthing hidden treasure.</div>

Not sure if you are thinking text or display.
Gill Sans was most used, but has always been popular, so not exclusively representative of that era.
IMO, the condensed geometric sans style, as seen in the word DAKS here in a 1938 ad in <em>Punch</em>, was a feature of the immediate pre-war era, but not used much subsequently. Tourist Gothic Alternates.</div>

Thanks for your (implicit, but very useful) counsel that *looking the part* is a very good substitute for authenticity! I fixate easily on historical specifics, and it's well worth pausing to reflect perhaps that only a tiny minority of the audience will appreciate them, whereas broader strokes arguably communicate more widely.

I'm a huge fan of TF-J and Nobel is a gorgeous face, but perhaps a little too adrift of the period, however (despite everything i was just saying about quirky 'f's!) Verlag is a compelling argument for period spirit over strict authenticity. (Ditto, Neuta).

Many thanks for your thought-provoking suggestions</div>

I'm always floored by the generosity and expertise of the community here, and your reply absolutely exemplifies the best of that community spirit. You've put your finger on absolutely the sort of "period-specific but not period-confined" detail that I was struggling to describe - bravo! Many thanks indeed.

As an aside, I've also been looking at contemporary film titling from the period, and perhaps followers of this thread might appreciate the attached (from http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9193023742763462354 )

In case this thread is of use to anybody else, I've taken the liberty of reordering the list by popularity, and annotated each face with a rough date (please don't hang me for the specifics - I've been wildly inconsistent between design / publication dates, and I've trusted the internet, which always ends well) - all of this evidence very much endorses the position that Justin, Ultrasparky and Paragraph were recommending...
