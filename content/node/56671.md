  someone identify these slab serifs? I think they're different. \r\n\r\nI've looked
  at a few of the usual ones, but the \"s\" are usually not gothic enough, especially
  when it's as bold as the sample.\r\nI'm looking for a slab serif that's \"gothic\"
  at the same time.\r\n\r\nHope someone can help. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You're spot on about Lubalin Graph Bold. Thanks!\r\n \r\nBut I don't think
    that Calvert is the right font. There is too much variation in the stroke weight.
    \r\nThe Optimism example is also heavier. \r\n\r\nAnyone else?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "True. Maybe it's been stroked. Cos even bold does not look as heavy as the
    sample posted. \r\n\r\nThanks for the ID. "
