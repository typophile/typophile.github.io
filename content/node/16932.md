  body: I don't think this is based on ITC Tiffany, it looks more like Caslon Heavy/Black/whatever
    very fat display weight.

  body: It might've started like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=ITC.119122.0.7&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Antic+cuina&sampleSize=48"
    target="new">this</a>, and was then redrawn by hand/massacred. The cap <em>C</em>
    is in fact an enlarged lowercase <em>c</em>, and the <em>u</em> looks indeed like
    a rotated <em>n</em> to me. The S.L. are regular Times.

  body: Caslon 223 was a great face to bad it never made it to the digital age. The
    black weight was the masthead face at a magazine I worked for called Folio. The
    closest you can come to it is Caslon 224, but I think it was viewed as a text
    face.

    to vectors that words for a client.\r\nFirst time I've seen it I thought it was
    Caslon too, but when I did see the crime that someone made with the uppercase
    \"C\" I knew that will be easier to draw it...\r\n\r\nThank you again."
