  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey everyone ! 

I started a personal project called Mood wich basically is a pencil illustration vectorized and modified in Illustrator and Photoshop . 
As you can see for now it looks awful , so I wanted to know from the experts what do they think and what you would change to make it better. I am lost as it's my first illustration-composition.

Pierluigi, thanks for the additional info. But if you're going to make the word "mood" the focal point of the illustration, employers will assume it's an example of what you might draw if they asked you to make an illustration on that subject.  

I'd suggest making the entire composition say something about "mood". For example, if the mood was "angry", what font would you use, what color would the word be, and what would the background elements be? What if the mood was "happy" or "sad"? Or what if the word was "Moods" (plural), how could you illustration a variety of moods in a single composition?   

Whatever word or meaning you pick, make sure the composition communicates a strong message or feeling. That will make a much stronger impression with employers. Design isn't about just drawing pretty pictures; it's all about communication.

I didn't include any message ,for me it only needed to look cool,just a random composition of colors, like abstract art, is this a crime ? I know that communication is the FIRST thing in our job , without design is WORTHLESS,I always convey messages and feelings in my design project , but this is not one of them. I wanted to try and just mess around for once.NO employer will see this , it won't appear in my  portfolio, I won't show it to clients. Just me and some friends of mine , to show them what I can do with 3d software + photoshop, right?Technical abstract stuff, I don't know the exact definition for this project .
Never mind anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't see any harm in "messing around." Having personal process unrelated to actual client-based work is extremely important. But when you post that work online and ask for feedback, but then claim "I wanted to try and just mess around for once," well there's no real critique or feedback for that (from me anyways.)

My main issue was when you said "just show them what you can do with photoshop." Anyone can do that in photoshop. Why not do "real" process with paint and pens, etc.? Just a thought.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My making up a purpose for the design, it makes the job a lot easier. That way can show how you're able to use your abilities and it will actually be a lot easier to come up with something. You don't have to put that much thought into the purpose. For example: you're making a cover for a drinks menu for a gay night club called Mood. Now you can imagine the types of colors used at such a club. What kind of atmosphere it has. What the clientèle would be into. Maybe it's a self titled post rock album by a band called Mood. Maybe a subway poster for Mood jeans.

Those projects will also show what you can do with Photoshop with the bonus of having focus and showing that you can put your talents to use.

As for the design you showed:
The spraypaint splatter thing has been over for many years and you used dead gray (zero saturation). Never, ever use dead gray.
Even though it feels like the design is attempting to be trendy, the palette doesn't seem to correspond to current color trends. If you were going for 1989 retro, the yellow doesn't seem right unless you pair it with purple and maybe teal. It feels like a bunch of colors someone made up in Photoshop, to be honest.
The way you're using that counterless font feels a bit like 2007.
Diagonal lines as a decorative element isn't due for a comeback until the 2020s, especially when used with spray paint. Need for Speed Most Wanted used that kind of look in the menu interface in 2006 and it already felt a few years out of date.</div>

I call it "cool gray" ("cool" meaning the opposite of "warm"). And while it's not appropriate for all jobs, it's perfectly appropriate in some. One example off the top of my head is Apple, which uses cool grays all the time in their graphic design.  But I agree that it's not what I'd use in this particular illustration.

		<div class="commentbody">Graphic designers often use the term "cool gray" because we frequently use the Pantone Matching System (PMS) to specify ink colors, and "cool gray" is the term that Pantone uses for grays with no saturation. The PMS system is also built into programs like PhotoShop and InDesign, along with RGB, CMYK, etc.

For example, "PMS Cool Gray 5" is a solid ink color that's equivalent to a 50% screen of black.
