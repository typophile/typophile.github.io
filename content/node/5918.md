  body: If it&#39;s from Urban Outfitters it&#39;s probably Jeremy Dean&#39;s hand
    lettering &#40;some of them seem to have been converted to fonts&#41;. House Industries
    is also doing a Jeremy Dean Vs. House Industries set that is going to include
    a bunch of fonts in this style. There used to be an preview of the set on Jeremy&#39;s
    website &#40;<a href="http://www.comfortablelead.com/" target="_blank">http://www.comfortablelead.com/</a>&#41;
    but it&#39;s gone now.
