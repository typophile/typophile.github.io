  body: "I don't think it's custom.\r\n\r\nI think some \"designer\" got a hold of
    a JPEG of the logo but had no PDF or vector of it, so he livetraced it in illustrator
    and took out all the awkward points. The /C/ in Culinary looks perfectly traced,
    but the rest isn't.\r\n\r\nOther than that, it looks a lot like a Caslon."
