body: I am new to typophile and wanted to post this font I started working on. It
  is a hybrid font consisting of helvetica and bodoni. I am thinking of making a serif
  face from this face and just wanted to know what people thought. Thanks. <BR><img

  body: 'Welcome to Typophile! <BR>This design would have been a big hit... in the
    90s.  :-/ <BR>I wouldn&#39;t want to discourage you, and if it&#39;s something
    you&#39;re motivated to finish you should definitely do so - at the very least
    it would be a good learning exercise. Just know that many people will think &#34;there&#39;s
    another one&#34;, even if it&#39;s actually unique in some way. <BR> <BR>Try this,
    if you like: figure out what you really like about Helvetica and Bodoni, and make
    a totally new font based on that. Make the forms not by literal splicing, but
    by... &#34;abstract synthesizing&#34;? <BR> <BR>BTW, that loaf on your site makes
    me hungry!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant--I know the concept behind this font is dated and could have been done
    in the &#39;90&#39;s and I am in the process of doing just what you described.
    I am working on a new face that would blend the characteristics of a classic serif
    and modern sans serif font. I still think that a hybridized font still has it
    place in today&#39;s typography, even though this needs a lot of work. I want
    a versatile font that can hopefully add to some of my motion graphic work. Thanks
    for you response.

  body: I agrre with Hrant. Nice work but dated. In some ways I miss the 90&#39;s
    and all the great experimental type design that was going on.  <BR>I have wondered
    if this type of design still worth doing as commercial work, but when I am honest
    with myself I realize it must be extraordinary &#40;in execution as well as concept&#41;
    if it needs to sell., and still I doubt it can be successful. Your work is nice
    but not exceptional. Similar fonts have already been fused and I think you need
    to make this more unique if it is intended to make you money. For personal use
    who cares as long as you enjoy building it and learn from the experiment. Good
    luck. <BR>To help you with any research check out Michael Worthington, Geoff Kaplan
    &#40;Sucker&#41;, Stephen Farrell &#40;Missive, Entrophy&#41;, Jonathan Barnbrook
    &#40;Drone&#41;, Max Kisman &#40;Fudoni&#41;. Rodney  <BR>Fehsenfeld &#40;Canadian
    Photographer&#41; <BR>Of all the hybrids out there I think the Frakture/Sans hybrids
    are the nicest.

    Calvin. I agree with hhp&#39;s comments. I&#39;m sure that it will be a good learning
    experience for you to keep working on this design. You&#39;ll gain knowledge that
    you can apply to your next typeface.

  body: 'Random thoughts from the padded cell: <BR> <BR>My very first reaction to
    your sample was<i> &#34;Why the funky serifs?&#34;</i>  <BR> <BR>After examining
    the letters a bit more, it seemed to me that there was no particular reason for
    <i>any</i> of the serifs to be where they are. Some of them don&#39;t even make
    any sense at all &#40;uppercase <b>E </b>for instance&#41;. This may be fine for
    a headline in some trendy magazine but I would <i>hate</i>  having to read a full
    page of text set in this.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure you devoted some time formulating
    the underlying design-concept of this font but I&#39;m sorry to say that it doesn&#39;t
    show up in this specimen at all. The first word that does come to mind here is
    <i>&#34;random&#34;</i> and that is never a good word in the context of a font
    &#40;unless you are Erik van Blokland of course&#41;. <BR> <BR>That being said,
    I would ask you to carry on and refine your design, despite the slashing here.
    It wouldn&#39;t be fair if your very first effort became the next Univers, right?'
