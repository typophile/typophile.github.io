body: This came up on another board, which I though might be answered here... <BR>Does
  anyone have knowledge of the font used for the serial numbers on US currency? Not
  looking for images, but an actual font. If not known, is there one reasonably close?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Alan Steytler

  body: I would assume it is custom made. Especially considering the other anti counterfitting
    measures that have been taken. <BR> <BR>But then again, I could very well be wrong.

  body: The serial numbers are printed using &#40;as far as I know&#41; a Zeiser letterpress
    banknote numbering machine. It&#39;s the last thing that goes on the note. The
    typeface is custom made but I don&#39;t now what it&#39;s called. Sorry. <BR>

  body: Alan Steytler, <BR> <BR>Do you need more than the numbers. Lanston was owned
    by the American Banknote Company. We sold many cheque number fonts, stock and
    bond related fonts etc. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>I am not sure however about legalities. In Canada customers required
    permits for most Banknote products. <BR> <BR>Printed materials was produced in
    locked guarded cages. Jail for a job. Not nice. <BR> <BR>The last comments is
    only to make you aware there may well be restrictions in your country. <BR> <BR>Gerald
