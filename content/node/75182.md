body: "Teeline Fonts is proud to announce the the arrival of Ambicase Modern.\r\n\r\nAmbicase
  Modern takes the next step in unicase font design, offering not \"either/or\", but
  rather \"both/and\". Each letter in Ambicase Modern is a combination of its traditional
  upper- and lowercase forms, in a modern (didone) style. The inventive, hybrid forms
  that result are intriguing and handsome. \r\n\r\nAmbicase Modern stands out as a
  carefully crafted experimental font: its eccentric forms do not hinder its readability.
  It is suitable for high-style display settings.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAmbicase Modern
  offers a large character set and extensive OpenType features. Most notably, in modern
  OpenType-aware applications, Ambicase Modern can be set in swash mode, which features
  sophisticated decorative flourishes that differ depending on whether the letter
  is at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. \r\n\r\nAmbicase Modern is available
  in two optical sizes: Regular and Poster. At very large sizes, the Poster cut, with
  its finer details, is recommended. An attractively-priced set of both cuts is available.\r\n\r\nAmbicase
  Modern is available in .otf and .ttf format for purchase and download at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/teeline/ambicase-modern/|MyFonts]]

    to me as \"\u0178\" just because I'm not Dutch?</em>\r\n \r\nThat very issue came
    up on the crit board for Ambicase - see the 9 February posts on [[http://typophile.com/node/60316?page=4|this
    page]]. In sum, the /\xFF/-looking form has precedent in Dutch (particularly in
    handwritten Dutch) that inspired it here. But to be clear, it's a user-selectable
    alternate, and only in Dutch, so it won't appear in Dijon, hijack, frijole etc. "

  body: Conceptually <a href="http://www.virusfonts.com/fonts/prototype">Prototype</a>
    is actually quite different, as it must be categorised as an experiment in deconstruction/reconstruction,
    using existing letter forms (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/gill_sans_pro_complete_pack/">Gill
    Sans</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/perpetua_pro_complete_pack/>Perpetua</a>
    respectively) to create a new typeface. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/teeline_fonts/ambicase_modern_set_ot/">Ambicase</a>
    is an entirely original design. They may be similar design concepts, but there
    is an important nuance IMNSHO.
