  about playing off of the word \"Cleave\" and went with an image of a cleaver.\r\n\r\nIs
  it too cheesy? Does it work? Does the tagline help? Thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cleaver-Design_5325.jpg]"

  body: "Although the connotations are a bit strange to me (the name), I feel like
    you could do something much more memorable / original with your look than big
    type + a weapon... knife... thingy? \r\n\r\nFew things... in my modest opinion
    and experience:\r\n\r\n1. Looking at your mark, I would lose the blade knife thing,
    and stick with the diminishing line and the cleave mark through it... having the
    knife seems redundant and a bit blunt for any viewer with some intelligence...
    also really focuses too much on the negative connotation in my opinion.\r\n\r\n2.
    I would lose the combination \"g + n\" in Design \u2013\_or is there meaning there?
    Was the \"n\" cleaved? (cloven?), if you are aiming for something like that, perhaps
    a pure type solution could be found that does it in a more intelligent way, and
    would also make the mark unecessary?\r\n\r\nGood luck! bm"

  body: I agree that the cleaver/knife is awfully prominent... you could try to show
    the logo "cloven," perhaps between the "Cleave" and "Design" words, with a cut/tear
    between the words. If you like the knife, how about showing less of it (more the
    handle sticking out from the cut "page" with the blade beneath)?

  body: 'I like the start of the idea. Your tagline really says it all without the
    meat cleaver. You might be able to incorporate the "clean-cut" idea in the company
    name like Scott mentioned and maybe it''s not a a tear, but a clean cut through
    the words horizontally starting small and increasing as it goes through the whole
    word. I would also agree in not combining the ''g'' and the ''n'' unless you have
    a reason for it. I like your color choice.  '

    graphic to go along with it - I''m having a hard time visualizing the tear that
    you and Scott mentioned...any more ideas? Or any help visualizing it?'

    I'd put it splitting the 'gn' in design.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I value my opinion,
    but there is little reason for anyone else to do so (except maybe for the fact
    that I am usually right)\r\n; )"

    I don't like the cleaver imagery at all. If I were a potential client, I would

  body: The "gn" ligature (or is it really) doesn't work at all, and is totally unnecessary
    too.
