  or one or the other?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Peignot and Hobo might fill the first half of the bill, but I'm not sure they
    play well together...

  body: I'd be inclined to say that Cheltenham, rather than Hobo, says "country".
    Peignot, Optima, Helvetica, Avant Garde, Futura - all of those would say "city".

    resist.\r\n\r\nAs far as typefaces, I'd consider having the \"coutry\" type a
    hand-drawn version of the city face."
