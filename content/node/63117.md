  body: Thank you very much! Very beautiful work! The flow is incredible. You did
    an impressive improvement (IMHO). The "a" and "s" have been totally redrawn and
    i's dot incorporated in the ornament. Really love it, can't stop watching it...
    Thanks again for your time.

    straight on in a similar size to the original? Everything on Root's site is shot
    at an angle. TIA."
