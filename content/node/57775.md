body: our company has been using futura for their branding. so far it's been used
  in some pieces as the display AND the body font. i'm putting together some new materials
  with heavy text and am looking into using futura as only the display font. i need
  some good suggestions on body fonts that will work well - or perhaps even mimic
  futura but with a shorter x-height? open to any input or inspiration!

  body: 'Are you sure you want a shorter x-height for body? I assume you mean larger.
    In that case: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova/">Proxima
    Nova</a>. Note that there is a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_regular/?&sample_text=See%20alternate%20%E2%80%98a%E2%80%99%20below.&acs_pt=36&acs_ss=15">single-story
    Futura style ''a''</a>.'
