    is close</a>, but the E and K are wrong. Oddly, the E and K from <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/pump/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D71%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DRYTHEM%2520TRACK%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D21\">Letraset's
    Pump</a> seem to match, but I can't believe you'd mix and match two such similar
    faces like that. Maybe Blippo has alt characters I don't know about? Or maybe
    that's how they rolled in the 80s?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks. The E and the K were throwing me off too, I thought it was Bauhaus
    at first. God only knows what they were using to set type at a 1980's record pressing
    plant in Jamaica... it makes recreating these things a real pain in the butt.

  body: "The original version of Blippo had quite a few alternate characters. I'm
    looking at an old specimen and all the characters in the sample are there.\r\n\r\nQuite
    often, with digitizations of old film fonts like this, when there are alternates,
    only one version of each character makes the cut, unfortunately."
