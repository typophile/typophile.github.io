body: "I think this font came from a Letraset rub-on kit in the late 1980s, but I'm
  not quite 100% sure of that.  Still, I'm trying to figure out what it is.  It's
  pretty close to Souvenir Bold Italic, Goudy Heavyface Italic, and Times New Roman
  Bold Italic, but none of them are quite right.  Does anyone have any ideas?\r\n\r\n

  for your insight!"
