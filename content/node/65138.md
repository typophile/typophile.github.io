  With no style guide, no brand guidelines and no solid precedent, I had near-complete
  freedom.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear what you think of the layout, typeface-selection,
  and heck, even cover design. I've never done a project this long and in-depth before
  (in terms of amount of information and page length), so I'd love to hear how I can
  do better in the future.\r\n\r\nI made a couple of decisions that were strange,
  and I look forward to allowing you to critique my reasoning in follow-up comments,
  but I hope to hear how it strikes you without first hearing my justifications.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a hair over 1 MB, so you can visit the .pdf in a browser at: http://drp.ly/2D08V\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your thoughts, typophiles!"

  body: "Is that ps. Ratio you are using? I just saw it, and it looks great. What
    concerns me is that both that one, and Klavika on the frontpage are very techy
    designs. (I\u2019m currently considering both for a technology firm.) They\u2019re
    not really something I\u2019d use for an organization primarly concerned with
    humans. Also, mixing two sans serifs with a very different structure looks really
    messy. You should look for a serif and a sans with similar structure/skeleton,
    or perhaps just make better use of the different weights/widths in a single font
    family."

  body: To tell the truth, I downloaded the PDF yesterday, then forgot about it. When
    I opened it today, my first reaction skimming through it was "why on earth I downloaded
    the manual for some sci-fi war (video)game?". ;-)

  body: "@frode and @riccard0, thanks so much for the feedback. It really means a
    lot that you'd take time to give me feedback on this.\r\n\r\nIt is ps Ratio.\r\n\r\nI
    wanted to go with a clean sans for this to convey simplicity, and I likely over-reacted
    to a certain extent against the tendency to make all non-profit materials feel
    \"rough\" or \"grungy.\" I loved the clean readability of both Klavika and ps
    Ratio.\r\n\r\nOriginally, I was going to go with Klavika for headers and Museo
    for body copy, but the Klavika felt too cold and the Museo felt too quirky. So
    in the end, I went with Ratio. I thought it conveyed a human, approachable quality
    with its heavy weights (specifically the downward serif on the upper end of the
    \"C\" and the low mean line on the \"A\" and \"E\")  I stayed with Klavika for
    the cover, as Ratio felt a little *too* quirky and unprofessional to be the face
    of the entire manual.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhat are some clean and professional, yet
    human, pairs you guys would suggest in lieu of the ones I chose?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs
    far as the dress code, I should clarify that this isn't for a church or for the
    right to show up on Sundays :) It's for high school students who will be visiting
    foreign countries (principally South America and Africa), so it's much more an
    issue of being extra careful to not violate their mores and offend them."

  body: "Some quick thoughts on the layout:\r\n\r\n- Navigational elements\r\nWhat's
    really lacking for me are elements that assist the reader in quick referencing,
    as well as identify which section he/she is currently reading. I find myself getting
    lost quite easily.\r\n\r\n- Look out for awkward breaks\r\nExample: Pg 32: I'd
    probably move the whole paragraph over.\r\n\r\n- Space for writing\r\nIs there
    a reason why you have decided not to have writing space for reflections and/or
    personal notes? Is the manual is meant to be passed on or reused?\r\n\r\n- Format:
    Digital or print?\r\nIf this is for digital distribution, that would answer my
    question about writing space.\r\n\r\n- Folio\r\nIn print, the folio on the left
    page will end up pretty near the page gutter."

  body: "I just had to get this in the hands of the communication department, so it's
    out of my hands. I'd love to keep the conversation up so I can get better for
    the future, though! Thanks again for all the help you've been giving me so far.
    It's my first typesetting project, so I really need it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nJabez,\r\n\r\nThanks
    so much for taking the time to comment.\r\n\r\n-Nav: My hope was that the bottom
    next to the page numbers would be enough assistance. Do you feel I just need more
    prominent placement of this, or additional navigation?\r\n\r\n-Spaces: The idea
    is that they'll write in their own journal rather than in the book to encourage
    them to use more space.\r\n\r\n-Breaks: Great call on this p. 32 break. I totally
    missed that.\r\n\r\n-Format: print\r\n\r\n-Folio: I'm not sure I follow here.
    Each page will be printed independently, one-sided, no left-and-right setup. What
    do you mean by \"the folio on the left page?\"\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFrode, great suggestion
    on Gloriola. Can't switch away from Ratio at this point, though. I've marked the
    font to come back from it, it's really nice. I also updated the coloring and switched
    the cover font to Ratio as well. I think getting rid of Klavika certainly helps
    some. \r\n\r\nSee an updated version here: http://drp.ly/2E01O"
