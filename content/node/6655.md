  body: I think there are two fonts here. The all-caps lettering looks like Zapf&#39;s
    Aldus, which is similar to Palatino, but without the serif on the arm of the F.
    <BR> <BR>The other font looks a bit like Palatino in the half serifs on the h
    and n. The other letters are quite different from Palatino, or any other Zapf
    fonts I looked at. The s is particularly odd with the missing lower serif.  <BR>
    <BR>I am still looking into this one.

  body: My bet is this is a custom-made serif/sans hybrid. I could be wrong.

  body: The similarities with Palatino are so strong that it seems somebody has borrowed
    the original font and has _fine tuned_ &#40;?&#41; it. <BR> <BR>Not so evident
    to consider it as an hybrid face, I think.

  body: It&#39;s rather disturbing to see something that looks so much like Palatino,
    but with that incongruous &#39;t&#39; and &#39;a&#39; &#40;and other less obvious
    changes&#41;. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s something immoral about that comma.
