body: This is another post in which I am asking about the techniques type designers
  in their own work. How do you determine letter widths and their relationships to
  each other? Do you plan it all out? Is it handled with reference, based on icons
  of the genre? Do you drop a grid or control letter in the mask layer or trace over
  one on paper? Do you just eyeball everything?

    thing is, I have spent a lifetime training my eyes so I trust them after 65 years
    of eyeballing. Systems have their place if you have a set outcome you are trying
    to match. Since I am rarely trying to match a preconceived notion, there is no
    value in applying a system.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    I'll go in and start drawing letters, and parts of these form the basis of other
    letters, but some of these new forms relate to previously drawn ones which must
    then be changed. This can go back and forth for quite a while.\r\n\r\nOther designers
    have very different processes."

    of any given letterform, right? -- not the set width, i.e., sidebearings?

  body: "The goal as far as widths is to have even color and good rhythm. This dictates
    a width relationship between the different letters, but it will vary with the
    design, so as Chris says your eyes have to tell you what is good. I think you
    have to design the letters adjacent to other letters, and test how well they space
    with other letters at the same time. And recursively. It makes life easier if
    you can stick with your control letters--n,o,H,O--and don't have to alter them,
    but you have to do whatever it takes to make it work well. \r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I also think that the counters in the n,o, and in the H,O need to look visually
    equal, and the other letters follow suit. I think the divided letters--sae--and
    t require special care to get right. On the upper case you have more latitude,
    but some groups of letters need to relate. Eg, you can have a wide or narrow E
    with the same HO, but then FLT probably have to relate to the E. \r\n\r\nThere
    is a video of Goudy drawing a letter, and he's doing it with two others adjacent.
    I think the punch cutters did this with smoke proofs also. I would be surprised
    if even Guttenberg didn't do it. Beyond the basic design idea, much of your design
    work is getting the letters to work well together. "

    out, usually, but a good sense of the desired result in terms of kind of face.
    I usually have some exemplars that represent the same basic qualities that I'm
    after and will refer to them in the process of development, not to duplicate per
    se, but to have some point of reference. No grid; sometimes a control character;
    sometimes sketches, if I've worked something out on paper that I'm attached to.
    \r\n\r\nBut, in the end, it all gets adjusted according to eyeball -- 'til it
    \"clicks\" and I get the rhythm I'm looking for. (Yeah, I know Hrant hates that
    word.)\r\n\r\nBill mentions the time-honored control characters n, o, H, O. Logic
    would dictate that if you just concentrate on these and get them completely right
    first, then it will save fiddling later with all the derived characters. \r\n\r\nIn
    practice, however, I find that it works better for me to just plow through a good
    chunk of basic characterss first so I can start judging more in words than in
    strings. So, more like h n m u r i l o e p b d . Then I can start getting some
    words going. This means more work when I make an adjustment that affects related
    chars, but I feel more confident in my decisions seeing them played out more broadly.
    I guess that's just how I roll. ;-)\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"
