  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It seems to me that it should be feasible to create decent looking fonts with upem values between 64 and 128.</p>
<p>The purpose for me is to represent points as 8-bit values in memory restricted microcontrollers. In the past I have defended my viewpoint that the advantages of outline fonts make them preferable to bitmap fonts even on microcontrollers. The typical microcontroller today has lots of processing power but not necessarily a lot of RAM. Quarter VGA colour displays are easily connected to such a micro and I just hate to see nasty blocky fonts being used on hardware that in my opinion might just as well display beautiful anti-aliased sub-pixel positioned outline fonts. Once the rendering of outlines is in place the render code can be used for displaying more types of graphics, for instance buttons of various shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Some experiments that I have carried out seem to confirm the idea. I converted various 2048 and 1000 upem fonts to 128 upem fonts, with some of the fonts the conversion was hardly noticable whereas the more artsy fartsy fonts suffered a great deal from the conversion. On a QVGA display no bells and whistles are required. One of the arguments against outline fonts would be that they require too much storage space, but I just cannot believe that this is true. Especially if I can consequently store point data as 8-bit values. In addition to low space consumption, fixed 8-bit values would offer simplicity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Are you aware of the presence of such fonts? Is anybody using such fonts? Designing them? Are there simple font file formats based on similar ideas?</p>
<p>I am a software developer, not a designer.</p>

<p>But the data in the fonts I am producing is scaled (e.g 60 UPM units per pixel), so the final UPM size is not as small as the design size.</p>
<p>I would be interested in testing if fonts with a 1:1 grid ratio work well in common font engines. Please feel free to <a href='mailto:gustavo@hipertipo.com'>drop me an email</a> if you would like to collaborate on some experients, I would be glad to send you some prototype fonts for tests.</p>

<p>On a related topic, Matthew Carter originally designed Charter to take up as little storage space as possible. (He tells a funny story about how, after finishing the design, he was told that the computational restrictions he had designed it for were no longer an issue.) Again, I&rsquo;m not sure what the UPEM settings are for those fonts, but it might be relevant to your inquiry.</p>

<p>TTF&rsquo;s <em>glyf</em> table can store coordinate values either in a byte or in two, depending on how big the value is. So a small UPM and hence smaller coordinate values may make a difference. I assume that <em>CFF</em>, with its different ways to represent integers, allows for similar optimization.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For a specific [text] size, a bitmapfont will always be smaller. The only exception
might be designs with long straight lines (not pretty). Think about it: a pixel in a
bitmap font can be just one bit; in the worst case (if you go for subpixel rendering,
which nobody has done yet AFAIK) a pixel would be 3 bytes*. With outlines, even at
1 byte per x/y coordinate you&rsquo;re looking at for example 8 bytes to define the smallest square. In practice of course you don&rsquo;t define an outline square for each pixel, but
you certainly need more than 3 bytes per end-result pixel.</p>
<ul>
<li>And this is only at the edges of the glyph.
The body of the glyph being solid, run-length
encoding** compresses the data to near-nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>** What would be great BTW is to compress the
data in vertical columns, since [Latin] glyphs
have long verticals but short horizontals.</p>
<p>Where outlines do save more space is if you reuse the same outline to generate
a large number of sizes; but you have to resort to hinting (and superhinting*)
to coax the outlines to come close to what the bitmap would do. Also, if you
decide that text flow is paramount you have to abandon integer glyph widths,
so bitmaps are out the window, but then the net result is ugly rendering.</p>
<ul>
<li>The moving of an individual point in an outline glyph for one ppem.</li>
</ul>
<p>More than saving space, outlines rule the land now because they save effort.
To me however this is a bit strange, because if you really want to save effort
you shouldn&rsquo;t be designing type in the first place!  :-)</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the thing: are you making a large number of sizes, or a few?</strong></p>
<p>More:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bitmaps don&rsquo;t have to be blocky:
<a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/</a>
And that&rsquo;s not even using subpixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CJK fonts as a rule use small UPMs, to save space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Downer: I didn&rsquo;t realize an actual coarse grid was used! I always
thought the segmentation was an effect applied at full Em resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carter/Charter: the way that design saved space was to use straight
lines for short segments, thus eliminating control point data for those
segments. BTW, there have been font formats (most notably during the
phototype era, but also used by URW to release lo-fi trial versions of
their fonts) that feature straight lines only, and I believe [some] font
rasterization algorithms [still] rely on this when the laser hits the film.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amount of savings: one would expect 1-byte data to take up half the
space of 2-byte data, but because of compression this is not the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey, here&rsquo;s a crazy idea for saving more space: use lossy compression!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>In direct competition to Gustavo (a friend from our Ultrafonts days, FYI :-)
I will also offer to work with you. I guarantee we can nail down a killer way
to deliver the best font rendering anywhere at the smallest filesizes. This
might actually involve outlines that mimic bitmaps exactly, but it&rsquo;s the
spirit of the bitmap that shines through and delivers the goods.

<p>BTW, can you tell I love this stuff? I&rsquo;ve been making
screenfonts since 1982, and I don&rsquo;t want to stop.  :-)</p>

<p>On some level you&rsquo;re right. For one thing, unlike you I&rsquo;ve never been good
at making money. But it&rsquo;s not that I haven&rsquo;t learned anything about &ldquo;modern
font software&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s that I think most of what most of the rest of you do is
dead wrong, or at best a cheap shadow of how it should be done. To be fair,
I guess it&rsquo;s really a matter of what drives each one of us, and how much our
particular lives afford us to dream instead of selling street-wise solutions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy that the type world has you. But it&rsquo;s not what makes my
own clock tick. And tellingly, as I hinted before, if you asked people
like Gates or Jobs, nobody who makes fonts has a working clock.</p>
