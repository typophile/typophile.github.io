body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI have been using Cronos, Myriad Pro, a few weights of Helv
  Neau I have been able to afford... However, I'm now looking for a sans that will
  set my work apart from the masses.\r\n\r\nI realise that the sum of my work depends
  on much more than the typeface I use, but Helvetica and Myriad are almost instantly
  recognisable, even by some of my clients, which although not entirely embarrassing,
  is something I would like to avoid in most circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe faces need
  to be equally at home in headlines in heavier weights, and as body text. I am looking
  for something a little more condensed than myriad and helvetica, which both seem
  to take up a lot of space compared to more recent sans'.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to cut a
  long story short I have shortlisted Vista Sans from Emigre, Antenna from Font Bureau,
  and Scala Sans.\r\n\r\nScala Sans seems the most informal, then Vista, leaving Antenna
  as the most dominant looking face (I really do like it)...\r\n\r\nWhichever I choose
  it needs to be useful for several months to come, and will be used predominantly
  in flyers, possibly logotype, and some corporate reports. A tall order from a single
  family I know.\r\n\r\nI'd love to know what people think about FB Antenna, as I
  cannot find any articles discussing it."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions... Miss Tiffany - that's a good point you raise
    - and a good selling point too!!! \r\n\r\nIf I do such a project and the client
    falls in love with a particular typeface, then they are more likely to bite the
    bullet and buy the extended license... Which helps me out I hope? I presume once
    I have the extended license, I can produce this kind of material for other clients
    using the same face?  \r\n\r\nFont licensing is not an area I pay a great deal
    of attention to, other than buying the things in the first place. I'm more aware
    of image licensing options (due to my photography background), so I guess it's
    only fair that fonts get the same protection.\r\n\r\nI'm personally surprised
    that font licenses don't ask for more if it is used in logotype... if a royalty
    free photo is used as part of a trademark then you have to buy an extended license,
    but not so for type it would generally seem."
