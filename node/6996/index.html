  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The dreaded upgrade is here and suddenly all my OS9 fonts are obsolete garbage. Adobe CS came with some nice fonts, but our shop needs so much more. <BR> <BR>On a lark, I downloaded Fontlab for OS X and opened a Type 1 font from OS 9. I exported it as OpenType, set some type with it in InDesign, made a PDF, opened it in Acrobat, preflighted it, and printed it to a Postscript Level 2 laser printer. Whoa. <BR> <BR>Did that really work? It can't be that easy. Can I batch-process 300 fonts to OpenType with Fontlab and keep production running smoothly? The boss would think I was god if I could pull that one off.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Whoa, now! <BR> <BR>Why do think your OS 9 fonts are obsolete garbage? <BR> <BR>Type 1 fonts are perfectly compatible with OS X and Adobe's CS apps. Converting Type 1 directly to OpenType offers no advantages other than a single font file with OTF versus separate outline and screen font files with T1. I think you're wasting your time with the conversion unless your entire Type 1 library is pre-1990 vintage and the bitmaps are still using FONT resources rather than NFNTs. <BR> <BR>Can you clarify why you think this is necessary?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jefferson <BR> <BR>There has been a long ongoing thread on this regard over at T-D (Type-Design). It may be possible to convert a standard PS1 to OT but batch conversion is a bit problematic at this point, especially if you are trying to combine certain fonts, say a font that also has a separate Expert set. Besides the encoding problem, PS1 fonts don't share kerning pairs. <BR> <BR>While I do agree that conversion will become a necessity, simply because at some point down the type road Adobe and Microsoft apps are not likely to support PS1, at this point I really don't see how this can be effectively done in any form of batch process (despite the proposed and much delayed FontLab TransTypePro).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Grant, <BR> <BR>I've tried running the fonts in question on OS X, which largely refuses to recognize them. Even Classic mode only sees about 18 out of 300. And Quark 4.1 only sees three of those in Classic mode. And it all crashes at the drop of a hat. For a number of reasons, we're moving to OS X and Creative Suite. <BR> <BR>Gerald, <BR> <BR>Thanks. I'll look for the thread you mentioned. I'm not absolutely opposed to doing all this manually, but I have to convince the boss that it can be done - and done successfully - for x number of dollars. The cost of Fontlab is equal to the budget I have for fonts, so it's an intriguing proposition.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I finally completed the process. Over 800 fonts in perhaps 140 families were converted manually to Open Type CFF. Mostly Type 1, and a few True Types. <BR> <BR>After conversion, I had to go back and redo the entire process: I had left out the Open Type naming fields, and the computer thought every font was &quot;regular.&quot; The names required manual correction in most cases. FontLab tended to call everything &quot;regular&quot; by default. Doh!-the time that wasted! Finally got it sorted out and am about to make a specimen book. If only OS X had a specimen book utility. <BR> <BR>I also created a few faked sloped fonts for romans that didn't have italics. (Yes, shame on me.) It's disturbingly easy to slant every glyph by x degrees with the push of a button</div>
