  Does anyone have any sugestions for a good serif typeface that contains the ligature?
  I you know of any uncommon variations of this ligature that would also be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you fellow Typophiles.\r\n\r\nGustav"

    be quite conservative. You might find it difficult to come up with \u2018uncommon
    variations\u2019.\r\n\r\nWhere there is some interesting variation in approach
    is in italic types, but this is due to the practical difficulty of distinguishing
    <em>\xE6</em> from <em>\u0153</em> in styles with a unicameral <em>a.</em>"

    is a phonetic phenomenon: a glide between two vowel sounds within the same syllable.
    The \xE6 character represents a diphthong in some languages, but in others it
    represent a pure vowel sound."

    but why do different versions of Franklin Gothic keep gatecrashing the list? I
    thought that was a sans serif."

    are you seeing Franklin? If you see a tag applied incorrectly to a font, you can
    always \"disagree\" with it on the font's page, which will improve your future
    searches as well as those of other users. That's part of any folksonomy I suppose\u2026
    there will always be some stray errors but they're publicly correctable, and the
    openness allows the overall system to be much more comprehensive."
