body: "\uFFFC\uFFFCastroluxtype's Spacepod is a headline display font set. The font
  contains uppercase and lowercase letterforms with a minimum glyph set. Sold through
  Myfonts.com. The style suggests weird sci fi from the 1970's or the far future...
  you decide? Is this the font for your sci fi western book cover title with a nod
  to The Matrix in the story or a poster for the movie remake of Westworld?  Wherever
  your ship takes you in the universe Spacepod should be the letterforms that identify
  your interstellar vehicle! See it at Myfonts.com http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/astrolux/spacepod
