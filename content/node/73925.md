  It looks pretty good on its own (and the music is really great) but what really
  got me hooked was the great type used for the titles.\r\nI feel like I have seen
  it before, but it may just be similar to another face.\r\n\r\nI tried searching
  WhatTheFont.com, but that didn't come up with anything. Here are the snippets I
  used. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture_4118.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture2_6285.JPG]\r\n\r\nAnd
  the trailer can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9n9hP_LtL8&feature=related\r\n\r\nCan
  anybody tell me what the typeface is? I'd really like to add it to my collection.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJuan\r\n"
