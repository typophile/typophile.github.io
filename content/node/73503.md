  Aalto's design for a door handle (\"VED\xC4\" = pull, \"TY\xD6NN\xC4\"  = push in
  Finnish). I fell in love with the unorthodox proportions of Aalto's lettering (which
  was of course made to fill certain width) and I have tried to keep that mood in
  my letterforms. I'm planning to include some alternative glyphs of different widths
  so user can more easily create words that have right amount of narrow and wide letters.\r\n\r\nThough
  Aalto's \xC4 is superb, I couldn't figure out any decent way to make it work, so
  I just made up my version.\r\n\r\nAny comments / suggestions are welcome!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alvar_6480.jpg]"

    must be optically adjusted I think this has to be assessed on merit."
