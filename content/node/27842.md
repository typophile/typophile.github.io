  body: "Are you under the impression that these are all showing the same typeface?
    \ Each one of your samples has something different in it, although the same lettering
    appears as one of the typefaces in the last two samples. Including the first sample,
    which was 'Irvin', you have about 8 different typefaces in your samples. Is there
    a particular one you want to try to identify a similar font for? \r\n\r\nThe assumption
    that you are making that these all must be based on a 'font' is not necessarily
    valid. As Tiffany said, those are all hand-lettered. Some of the hand-lettering
    could be original styles, and not copied from a metal typeface. The one with the
    strongly curved lower case 'y' is an example of something that may have been a
    style of that artist, and not a 'real' (existing) typeface at all. Even if there
    were a metal type that some of these were based on, they may not all have been
    digitized, so there might be no (digital) font like it at all.\r\n\r\nJust something
    to think about.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Just to show that I can be at least as obsessed about these 'quests' as the
    next person, I went through Mac McGrew's book 'American Metal Typefaces of the
    Twentieth Century' page by page looking for something that might resemble the
    last sample in your series, which I will call 'Myrna' thanks to it's distinctive
    'y'. \r\n\r\nThere was only one 'y' that was very close, and that was in the 'ty'
    ligature for 'Announcement Roman', done in 1916 by Morris Fuller Benton. That
    was almost its only resemblance to 'Myrna'. It seems the sweepingly curved 'y'
    was not very common in Twentieth Century metal type.\r\n\r\nSecondarily I looked
    for the odd 'a', which has no serif on the arch, and looks like it is going to
    tip over to the left. I couldn't find anything very close, although Pencraft and
    Packard had a little of that feeling, with a sort of blob serif that curls back
    into the letter. One other somewhat similar 'a' I will mention in a moment.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I was looking for these other specific letters I also was looking for typefaces
    that gave a similar 'feel' to 'Myrna', and here is where Goudy comes into it.
    For one thing Goudy's types often look like hand-lettering that has been cast
    in metal. For another, he often favors the stepped W, although I'm not sure we
    have this in the 'Myrna' lettering (it shows up in your other samples over and
    over though). In particular <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-kennerley/regular/charmap.html\">'Kennerly
    Oldstyle'</a> (I've linked to the Lanston version of Kennerley) has the Venetian
    'e' and an 'a' that looks like it's tipping over, although it has a straight serif
    on the arch. Certainly it was around well before this movie was made in 1931.
    However, it's 'y' is barely curved. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/goudy-38-rr/\">'Goudy
    38'</a>, done in 1908, also has many of these features and has a more curved 'y'.
    The R and K are less similar, though.\r\n\r\nThe typeface that might have been
    the closest overall also has a Goudy connection. Robert Wiebking was an engraver
    of Goudy's designs since 1911, and in 1922 he released a design of his own called
    'Munder Venezian'. It has the Venetian 'e', a stepped W, a K with the arms meeting
    below the midpoint on the stem (barely), an 'a' with no serif that leans ever-so-slightly
    leftward, and a somewhat sweepingly curved 'y', though not nearly as much as in
    'Myrna'. (I can post a scan on a web page in a few minutes, but my old Mac cannot
    post into the thread. Grrrr!)\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, 'Munder Venezian' has never
    been digitized.\r\n\r\n  - Mike Yanega"

  body: "In answer to your question about how the lettering was done, the simple answer
    is yes, each title card was done as a one off piece of art. That's the way all
    display lettering was done when it was done by hand. The point is that there were
    people who did this for a living -- they were lettering artists, and they were
    very good at it. Many of today's font designers also got started doing lettering
    by hand, but the computer gave them a new tool for doing this job, and exactly
    duplicating each letter. Before computers, film types were made by photographing
    hand-drawn letters. Before that engravers made the masters for metal type from
    the hand-drawn lettering of the designer. Before that artists drew all the letters
    by hand.\r\n\r\nThere are others here who can probably speak from experience,
    but I would expect that each artist made himself a set of lettering master alphabets
    for each lettering style they used. Probably many were copied from existing metal
    typefaces, or at least influenced by them, but I think it's fair to presume that
    some of these alphabets were essentially original designs by these artists.\r\n\r\nYou
    can see the sample of Munder Venzian I have scanned <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ID_Sample_Pages/MunderVenezian.html\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n-
