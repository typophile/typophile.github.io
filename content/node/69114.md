  body: "The student-teacher relationship is more like the customer-supplier relationship
    these days.\r\nOne's students are one's clients, so they expect value for money.\r\nAfter
    all, they're investing in getting a good job, the education is incidental.\r\nActually,
    I'm not totally cynical, I think student power is a necessary corrective to unfettered
    authoritarianism.\r\nIt's good to accommodate it within the system, which is more
    civil than externally through no-holds-barred \"rate your prof\" web sites.\r\n\r\nHaving
    done some teaching at Ontario colleges, I have been asked to distribute student-feedback
    questionnaires to students (taking up valuable teaching time while they fill them
    out!) so that they can let the powers that be know whether I'm up to scratch.
    Of course, with transparency, these are eventually forwarded to me (without student
    names, although it's pretty easy to figure out who says what). It's somewhat galling
    at first, but the good thing is when the head of faculty says sure, many of them
    think typography is the dullest, least creative, most useless part of graphic
    design, but we know better. And it can give a teacher a good indication of some
    areas where improvement may be necessary."

  body: "I see the loonies are running the asylum over on the other side of the pond
    these days. LOL I mean...if you are interviewing for a job with 8 year olds. Personally,
    I'd find that a waste of time more than anything else. Children do not know the
    appropriate questions to ask of a teacher. What are they going to ask...questions
    that make sense to them, of coruse. I can see the list:\r\n\r\n1) How much homework
    would you give?\r\n2) How much fun learning will there be, i.e. field trips, etc?\r\n\r\nI,
    honestly, would not have known what questions to ask myself, if I were that age.
    They are being put in a bad position. Infact, I would say that if they want valuable
    feedback, don't ask the kids, ask the parents.\r\n\r\nI do agree with Nick. I
    have to fill those questionaires out after every class. Of course, I do mine online.
    But, I feel, relatively, sure that the teacher can tell who is saying what. I
    mean, my typography teacher knew me, I'm sure. After all, I had the attitude Nick
    speaks of, \"Dullest, least creative, subject around\" going in. However, that
    all changed first week. Why? Well, my teacher challenged me to do better with
    every project, think outside the box with every response. "

    The teacher should also get to ask questions of the students. Then you could get
    Don Rickles to apply for the job :-)

  body: I love serifs. For me almost all grotesk fonts are schaftstiefelgrotesk. Except
    from that I always read <em>Schafstiefelgrotesk</em> and then I imagine the itchy
    (but beautiful) shear wool pullover that my mother has knitted for me, when I
    was a child. (And when the bitch has finished her work, it was too small, because
    I was grown. Sorry, Mama! But you are a master cook.)
