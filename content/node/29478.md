    is pretty comprehensive, Mahi. It'll certainly cover the languages you mention
    in your post.

    it for any serious work, especially not for print. It\u2019s OK for screen use
    but for print, use a combination of Minion Pro, Adobe Hebrew, Adobe Arabic and
    Kozuka Mincho Pro (all of them are bundled with Adobe Acrobat or some Creative
    Suite apps). \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "For multi-script typography, the mix-and-match approach is the way to go
    in most cases. I've found a number of Japanese fonts will cover all of the scripts
    you require (the Japanese scripts, Chinese characters, Latin, and Arabic) and
    more, but they are often so typographically poor as to be unusable outside of
    the Japanese and Chinese scripts. A one-stop font that will cover all your needs
    would be convenient, but I don't think there is anyone with the resources and
    the typographic knowledge to create a single font that works well for all scripts.\r\n\r\nAsk
    yourself what languages you need to support and which ones will be the most important
    to you. If for example you will deal a lot with Arabic and other languages that
    use the Arabic script, then find out what the good typefaces for Arabic are. Ask
    typographically-enlightened native users of the Arabic script. There are very
    few people who can judge the typographical merits of fonts for all the different
    scripts, but for single scripts you will get a lot of responses."
