  - a wonderful face, I love having the whole set consolidated, and while the Greek
  has not yet been helpful, the Cyrillic has been.\r\n\r\nHowever, I just noticed
  that for some odd reason the titling face that is part of our old Adobe Garamond
  set is not part of Premier Pro. Is there a reason for this? I would think that the
  very fact that \"titling alternates\" is an opentype choice in Indesign would be
  reason enough to include it, since the titling caps were, after all, an Adobe face
  (weren't they?) ... Or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nWhat is the story, Adobe?
  I was hoping to replace my entire Adobe Garamond with the new face, but now I see
  I have to have two versions on my system, which is kind of a pain in the butt. Will
  there be a 2.0 release which will integrate the titling face?\r\n\r\nYour friend
  and mine,\r\n\r\nJLT"

    [[optical sizing]] with Garamond Premier Pro removes the need for a titling variant.

  body: "Joshua,\r\n\r\nThe \"titling set\" is included in the Garamond Premier Pro
    family. The Display fonts form the \"titling set\" you're looking for. This optical
    size is an adaptation of Garamond's (the metal type) <em>Gros Canon</em>.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Adobe Garamond, this typeface was designed many years ago (1989) under significant
    technological restrictions (e.g. at the time there was a limit to the number of
    nodes that each glyph could contain, before crashing a printer, for example).
    The whole family was modeled on Garamond's <em>Parangonne</em> and Granjon's <em>St
    Augustin</em>. The titling set you see on this family is the result of Robert's
    first take (Minion is the another example) at making optical size designs.\r\n\r\nThe
    whole story is in Garamond Premier Pro's printed specimen. Can you get a hold
    of it?"
