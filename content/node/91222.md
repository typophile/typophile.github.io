  ) I stumbled, strangely after quite some time, into Figgins Sans.  What a beautiful
  thing.  Apparently it was created by some guy named Nick Shinn?  Anybody here ever
  hear of him.  I''d love to grill him sometime on how he came up with the lower case
  letters. Hmmmm.... If only...'

  body: "Thanks for the kind words. I do indeed spend some time at Typophile every
    day (have been doing so for the best part of a decade) and am not averse to a
    little show and tell. I can send you the Modern Suite specimen book, which has
    an essay on Figgins Sans, with illustrations\u2014contact nick\u201Cat\u201Dshinntype.com.\r\n\r\nIn
    my estimation of the original 1836 bold caps face by Vincent Figgins, the style
    had not yet settled into the typical 19th century grotesque mode, i.e. fat and
    furled curves, but had geometric elements. Therefore I did not give my extrapolation
    the \u201Cfunky grotesque\u201D treatment which is the norm in neo-Victorian sans
    serifs. This also made it a better companion for my revival of the contemporary
    Scotch Modern, which is packaged with Figgins as the Modern Suite.\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/2j3y3I0s0l0w233F290e/NewFigs.png\">\r\n\r\nThat accounts
    for the styling. For the lower case letter shapes, generally speaking I made them
    correspond to the Scotch. So the \u201Ca\u201D and \u201Cr\u201D are a bit awkward.
    I suppose I should have made the arm of the \u201Cf\u201D similarly wide, but
    that would have been impractical for a multi-lingual 21st century font.\r\n\r\nThe
    italic is quite strange, but really just a straightforward sansification of the
    Scotch italic."

  body: Damn no lowercase till the 1890s?  The Grotesks were around by then.  I really
    like the earlier English/Scoch/Irish whatever sans'.  There is something so refined
    about them.  Though I do love the standard German Grotesks as well.
