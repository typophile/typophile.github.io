body: "\r\nAnybody who knows a good version of Poliphilus? I bought it some time ago
  but was disappointed to find out it looks traced and badly spaced. Also, the italic
  that is supposed to go with it \u2013 Blado has problems in my opinion. Any thoughts?\r\n"

  body: I have the Monotype versions of Poliphilus (and Blado). It's a quirky font
    but does the trick IMHO. I'm not aware of another version.

  body: "Traced meaning a hand-drawn outline made on tracing (semi-transparent) paper,
    over a photographic enlargement.\r\nThat was presumably how Poliphilus was originally
    \"designed\"."

  body: Yes, probably right. The letters just reminded me of the results I often got
    working with Adobe Streamline and a scanner before everything was digital. Re-drawing
    logos for example.

  body: "The design goal for Poliphilus, as everyone here should know as the story
    is told in Talley of Types, was to provide a type so that you could set a page
    of Aldus's original and have it be indistinguishable from the original. This was
    considered to be an error soon after, and Bembo was the result. There is a good
    Scangraphic version, but it may have a different name. That will probably have
    fitting by Albert-Jan Pool or Volker Kuester - - if it does, it would be worth
    looking at even for that.\r\n\r\nHowever, much though I hate to agree with Joe
    Clark about anything, he is absolutely spot-on in his comment. Bembo and Poliphilus
    look pathetic unless printed letterpress. Because our expectations of Poliphilus
    are lower, I have a feeling that the digital version may not be quite so disappointing.
    \r\n\r\nBembo Book was designed after the Monotype 'C' photomaster, which was
    optimized for 13 points - - arguably not the best approach.\r\n\r\nBut seriously,
    if you want to use Bembo - - go to a letterpress printer! It may be cheaper than
    you think! "
