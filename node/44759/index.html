<div class=commentbody>You could also try showing the progression you have with the circles, by slowly increasing the size of each letter.
For example: b @ 25%, o @ 50%, o @ 75%, m @ 100%
Just an idea to play with...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, lop off that 'm' and let an errant 'b' into the room and you're in mamaland.
Besides the mammary associations, I'm not getting a real sense that anything is "booming" in this logo. It's fairly static. You need some motion in it.

<div class=commentbody>I'd like to see some circleness breaking out of the type - perhaps on the upper right, outside the m. It might demammarize, too. My first reaction was quite positive.

Boom - signifies shaking things up ... show it in your logo (concepts.)

<div class=commentbody>Hi all,
Thanks for your comments.
I didn't notice the hooters until they were pointed out (hee hee!). But yep, I see them now. I was trying to get the impression of amplification across and thought the circles looked a bit like speakers.
I agree that it's quite static looking, I think I'll go back to the drawing board and see what I can come up with.
Will post the results,
Thanks.

<div class=commentbody>I imagined something more energetic and maybe with a reference to cartoon lettering like the example below.
With the right treatment this could be very hip. :)

<div class=commentbody>For such an explosive word (pun intended) I'd personally like to see the work less rigid and locked down. While your version is clean and well constructed, it doesn't convey any energy, fun or excitement that could come with a moniker like Boom.
I might be repeating what a lot of others have said, but this is one of those projects that people love to get. It allows them to explore the less confining guidelines in logo design. Get creative and throw some passion into this less than stellar first attempt. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi,
Thanks for your comments.
The client works with a broad range of companies including theatre, medical, beauty and business. They would like the logo to show amplification.
Here are some changes to the first attempt and some very rough other ideas.
I know the speech bubble is used a lot but I think it gets the idea of amplification across and I like the circular look.
I guess the lower left looks too like the more4 logo.
Appreciate any thoughts.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option3_6413.jpg]</div>

<div class=commentbody>#1 has potential. I might suggest not making the 'm' so thick and making it more like the 'b' to show a progression of sound. </div>

<div class=commentbody>#1, #2 and #3 are the only ones that I find fresh and exciting. But you're having problems with letters. M is problematic on all of them. Ditch #3. Dead end. Ideally the logo is between #1 and #2 with changed m.
It will probably be the easiest to make m bigger in 1, which will emphasize every letter (otherwise it's also reading boo m - are you scared?)
COmpletely forget about 6 because it looks like clip-art logo.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really like #1. It definitely conveys a kinetic transfer of energy, as though the sound is passing through each letter and is just about to move into the 'm'.
I don't actually mind #4, though it is a bit more static. #5 reminds me of the more 4 logo.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/more4_144x134_5668.gif]
You're definitely on the right track with #1 though. Stick at it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not a big fan of changing the weight of letters progressively within a word, because i always hits a breaking spot where it just looks hokey.
It's like that Coca Cola product 'Zero'. Yeah, it has a very very very nasty type treatment hat I think originally was supposed to indicate weight loss, but I won't touch the stuff because it's such an abonimation of type.
I really strongly second 'all about seb's suggestion, having a fun vector comic-book boom would be wonderful.
You could also look at colouring treatments like comic book titles, big letters with half-tine gradients in them (which still hold up in B&W)

my first thought when I saw your rounded sansserif was intense sadness. It looks like it's trying to be too cliché, or too trendy, but I'm not certain of the freshness or longevity of a trend like that. Best of luck!</div>
