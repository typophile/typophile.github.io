body: "I'm looking for some feedback as I work out the details of this typeface. There
  two main quirks/characteristic that I think should be defining for this typeface:
  1) some bowls and stems connect with one with curved stroke and one straight stroke
  2) some strokes don't connect connect to the stem at all.\r\n\r\nThe issue I'm facing
  is where to use these quirks and how to reflect the style in the rest of the characters.\r\n\r\nHere's
  the current character set:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test1_4365.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here are the original characters with some alternate options\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test2_3508.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test3_5342.png]"

  body: Looking really good. Maybe even try it as a screen face because it has the
    geometric structure that I think would lend well to the screen and small print
    sizes. However, it would also excel at large poster sizes because of the quirkiness
    to some of the letterforms.  But I think that the 's' in both capital and lowercase
    could be tweaked to fit the rest of the forms. I'm also into the lowercase 'n'
    but the notches of the black lowercase 'm' don't need to be there. The alternate
    capital 'M', capital 'G', lowercase 'a' and capital 'R' are my favorites. Can't
    wait to set this when it's done.

  body: "A layperson\u2019s observations:\r\n\r\nI get what you\u2019re trying to
    do with the curved/straight/nonexistent connections and I think it comes out the
    most in the lowercase character set, except it\u2019s missing the \u2018no connections\u2019
    bit (unless you count the \u2018k\u2019). I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re dead
    set on that characteristic only coming out in the uppercase, but you could try
    it in the lowercase as well. It might solve the issues you\u2019re having with
    the \u2018m.\u2019 Another thing you can try\u2014you might already have but it
    hasn\u2019t shown up in the variations so far\u2014is curving the outside corners
    of the \u2018m\u2019 and keeping the middle straight (basically a reverse of the
    second to last variation you posted upthread). It may prove useful when you work
    on the \u2018w,\u2019 which segues nicely into my second overall observation which
    is that the angular letters of the alphabet don\u2019t seem to fit the rest of
    it yet. You\u2019ve got good things going with curved and straight uppercase letters
    like \u2018G,\u2019 \u2018R,\u2019 and \u2018U,\u2019 and the totally curved letters
    like \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018O\u2019\u2014love the squashiness of that one, by
    the way\u2014work as well, but the totally angular letters like \u2018A,\u2019
    \u2018W,\u2019 etc. look like they could have come from any sans-serif. I\u2019m
    not a fan of the middle of the \u2018W\u2019 going up to the cap height; I\u2019d
    also rather see it resemble a double-U more than a double-V. A separate tail on
    the \u2018Q\u2019 is more quirky looking too.\r\n\r\nThe fourth ampersand from
    the left fits with your lowercase letters better because of the one corner in
    the counter as opposed to two, but the one in black matches the uppercase more.
    \r\n\r\nFor the numbers, the 3 and the 5 are looking a bit off; I want to say
    it\u2019s because the connections are in the middle of the numbers rather than
    a little higher? It\u2019s not so bad on the 3, but quite noticeable on the 5.\r\n\r\nI
    like the flat bottomed letters better; the flat topped ones look like they\u2019re
    about to leap off the screen and stab me. I get a softer, almost leafy feeling
    from the typeface so far (may or may not be what you\u2019re going for), rather
    than a scary, futuro-gothic vibe the flat topped letters give off."

    was thinking along those lines too. The lowercase \"e\"\r\nand \"a\" are perhaps
    the best candidates to introduce gaps.\r\n\r\n> It might solve the issues you\u2019re
    having with the \u2018m.\u2019\r\n\r\nYes - maybe try a rounded-outsides arch
    like Olga suggests, but have the middle vertical not touch it! That might seem
    drastic, but if this font is supposed to be more than an exercise, worrying about
    what's already out there is very important - and frankly there's a lot of stuff
    like this already. So I would introduce some... quirks (!) into this design -
    but judiciously.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSome specifics:\r\n\r\nJ: longer serif.\r\nQ:
    much more bravado in the tail. The alt is nice though.\r\nR: firmer leg, maybe
    totally straight.\r\nS: at first I didn't like it at all, but now I think it might
    only need some shifting around.\r\nU: narrower.\r\n\r\nr: if you're keeping the

    it narrower.\r\nt: I would lose the left bar.\r\n\r\nnumerals: still very erratic.\r\n\r\n&:
    give yourself more time, observing quirky ampersands. Like here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/x1brett/4133496052/\r\n\r\nThere

    about to stab me\" territory. It looks interesting by itself but when you typeset
    it in a phrase it's quite weird.\r\n\r\nI miss the curved top though. Having both
    the top and bottom squared off gets too sci-fi and doesn't fit well next to the
    'e' and the 'a.' I don't know if this was intentional or not, but in the bottom
    curve of the 'C' and the 'G,' that corner gets a little thinner than the rest
    of the stroke, because the inside radius is a bit larger than it would need to
    be for a monoweight stroke... would it be possible to bring that into the S? I
    know the issue is that the letter has so many turns at once, but the tight rounded
    corners you got going on in these latest versions don't quite fit with the rest
    of your letterforms."

    I think you need to do the same for the middle join on the \"a\" as well.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    in order to make the horizontal and vertical strokes LOOK the same thickness (monoline

    For lowercase s, the left/black s (i.e. my suggestion, so take that as you will)
    is most harmonious in context. But capital S benefits from symmetry of top and
    bottom; the 12:55 Nov 29 S is still a frontrunner in my view, along with the "8ish"
    S (perhaps trim the ends more open) and the middle grey S (correct the overbite
    on the left and maybe raise the visual center some).'

    in a design such as this- there is more to gain by following other ideals, not
    least lateral symmetry (but also structural divergence). For example the \"d\"
    in Perpetua might seem jarring, but I feel that makes it more of a \"d\" and less
    of a \"p\".\r\n\r\n* Not a cartesian grid, but still a system that parts \"snap\"

    figuring this out as I write, but to my eye, with the capital, balance becomes
    more urgent; but with the lowercase, openness and  consistency come to the fore
    as more important. Caps can be self-standing; lowercase wants to flow. So, looking
    at the \"Sally sells seashells\" pic, I'd build on the dark gray /S/ (as you're
    doing), but for the lowercase go back to developing the black /s/ (which looks
    quite good with /e/ and /a/, for example). "

    this is the more conventional approach, and yes, I agree that conventions are

    is the appropriate solution for this design. You know best, Matt.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    the lc d in Perpetua is a mix of reflection and rotation.\r\nEven if the shape
