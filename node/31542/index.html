  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Typophiles,</p>
<p>I am designing a small exterior plaque for a turn-of-the-century landmarked building (eclectic/neoclassical in style). The name of the institution is nearly 50 characters.</p>
<p>Can anybody recommend a typeface that will be legible from the sidewalk and appropriate to the historical context of the building?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found so much helpful information on this board, but this is my first post.  Thanks in advance for any advice!</p>

Welcome to Typophile. I had a similar problem a while ago when I was working on the design of an external sign for a jazz bar here in Brazil. <a href="http://typophile.com/node/27895">http://typophile.com/node/27895</a>
It would be really cool if you could provide more details of the surrounding area and the characteristics of the building (if you cannot upload a photo, try to give a detailed description). So it needs to be visible from a pedestrian (rather than a driver) pont of view, is that correct? What about lightning? Does it need to be visible at night? What&rsquo;s the plaque&rsquo;s material and what&rsquo;s the tecnique you are using to engrave the name? I hope I&rsquo;m not being too pedantic!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi lore,
Thanks for your response&ndash; not pedantic at all!  You are right, the plaque needs to be visible to pedestrians, as opposed to drivers.  It will not need to be visible at night.  The plaque must be quite small and discreetly placed near the entry doors.  It will be brass, with the letters engraved and filled.</p>
<p>The neighborhood is in the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a special landmark district that is notable for its old mansions and townhomes. Today, many of these properties are consulates and institutions. The building is midblock (as opposed to a corner). The street is a beautiful, tree-lined block with a quiet, elegant, and patrician feel. I don&rsquo;t have images of the exact building, but am uploading two images that hopefully give an idea of some of the buildings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing some research (long way to go) and was looking at serif fonts such as Minion, Sabon, Stone.  But I wonder if a humanist sans might also work. Any thoughts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, thanks. Nice neighbourhood. I understand your concerns. Personally I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with Minion, Sabon and Stone and I think that technically there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with using a humanist sans since it seems you may need the contrast. I&rsquo;m trying to remember last time I&rsquo;ve seen a brass plaque in a similar context, unfortunately sublety is a rare thing in this country&hellip;</div>
