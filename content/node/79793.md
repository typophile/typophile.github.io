  York 1851. I am hoping to source typefaces that are from the period that have a
  very close DNA.\r\n\r\nMonotype Modern seems like a logical relative but I cannot
  find anything condensed/compressed enough.\r\n\r\nYour help on this is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\ni-o\r\n\r\nP.S.
  Please omit the conjunction \"OR,\" from your type identification.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.
  My apologies if I am not using the word \"Transitional\" properly."
