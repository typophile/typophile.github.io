  points per letter to get a transparancy effects, or maybe worked with a \"trashy\"
  looking font?\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I made the letters look like I wanted them
  to look - but when using the font in InDesign, the document got very, very slow,
  so I had to strip it down and try again all the time. I guess the number of points
  has a whole lot to do with this.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone have similar experiences and
  could give some useful tips?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    Illustrator and using it as a placed image.

    She made a stencil unicase font with a variant that\r\nmimics overspray, so it

  body: I had a student this year with the same problem Hrant mentioned. We "solved"
    the issue by making the text into a raster image at 600 dpi and saving it as a
    one bit diffusion dither. This is a technique I use all the time to print screen
    shots on my class handouts and they print quickly. On type it works best on grunge
    and distressed type or something with fuzzy edges

  body: "Hmm, I guess there is no straight answer for this one and experiment is the
    best way to maybe solve it, and I maybe a look at the \"FontLab limitations-post\"
    there aswell.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that I am doing the font in Fontographer, and
    it seems that between 200-300 points there is no problem (other than it sometimes
    slows down InDesign when zooming). At first when the letters carried about 600-700
    points it even made InDesign crash....\r\n\r\nBut the less points, the less transparent
    the letters look like.\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested, I am trying to make
    a font that looks like fluff... ;-)\r\n\r\nI think maybe 200-300 points is far
    to less points to get that effect?"

  body: You can also set the metrics in Fontographer to overlap glyph elements and
    make one letter out of several  character pieces, each with a smaller number of
    points. This will limit the number of letterforms in a font but each one you did
    could be more complex. This was mentioned in the early Fontographer tutorials
    as a way to do complex logo fonts.

    I opened a trashy font that was a TrueType-font in FOG, and was surprised that
    the font had over thousand points per glyph. This font was working just fine in
    InDesign, while my font with 500 points made InDesign very slow.\r\n\r\nWhy is
