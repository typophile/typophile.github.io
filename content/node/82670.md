body: Wanting to use the Linotype Rezident typeface for something I'm working on but
  am getting some complaints that the K looks like an H. Wondering what I might be
  able to do to tweak the K to make it less like the H but also keep true to the typeface
  as much as possible.

  body: "I drew Rezident quite some time ago (more than 12 years in fact) for the
    design of an identity. Initially I only drew the boldest weight (Rezident Four)
    as this sufficed for the job. That weight has a much higher contrast and is the
    most \u201Clegible\u201D in my opinion. It was also only this version that I submitted
    in 1999 to the Linotype 3rd International Type Design Contest where it won a silver
    award.\r\n\r\nWhen Linotype wanted to release the typeface in 2000 I decided to
    add a number of extra weights. Being a big fan of Zuzana Licko\u2019s Senator
    I decided that the lightest weight should also have a very low contrast. In hindsight
    I regret this decision because I feel this cut makes too many compromises and
    tries to maintain features that only work well in a heavier weight.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I think Nick\u2019s suggestion comes pretty close. I would fix the
    thin part in the middle though, and apply the same solution to the R. See picture
    below...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rezidentone_4312.png]"
