    then your main italic font (and perhaps others) is not correctly designated as
    italic - there's a checkbox for \"font is italic\" on the first screen of font
    info in FontLab....\r\n\r\nT"

    angle\" is set.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/italic_angle_3953.png]\r\n\r\n(BTW,
    the title of the thread is misleading. In your example, the \"weight order\" is
    correct; what is incorrect is the \"style order\", IMO)"
