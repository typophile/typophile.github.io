  of the 2011 editions of Michael Swanwick's <em>Stations of the Tide</em> and <em>The
  Dragons of Babel</em>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stations_4123.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dragons_6559.png]\r\n\r\n(Sorry
  for the low-res \u2013 these are the best I can find at present. <em>Stations</em>
  is taken from [[http://books.google.com/books?id=3rXU2H7KeHEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=michael+swanwick&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8-m4Uej4DIe9igLO9oGACA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|Google
  Books]]; the other is just a screenshot from [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0765331144/ref=rdr_ext_sb_ti_hist_1|Amazon]].)\r\n\r\nI've
  been looking for this for a while, but clearly my own skills are simply not up to
  snuff. Here's hoping y'all have better luck.\r\n\r\n-Leland Paul"
