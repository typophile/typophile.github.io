  body: The widest wide-format printer I've worked with myself was one that could
    print directly onto vinyl or paper rolls 6ft wide. If I had to print billboard-sized
    jobs I'd probably have to print it in strips and assemble it on site. But now
    I've heard of grand-format printers that can print on media 16ft wide. Our jobs
    cost hundreds of dollars. Something that needs to be that big probably costs thousands.

  body: "all the billboards in this neck of the woods\r\nare turning electronic.\r\n\r\nmost
    of 'em now rotate what they display\r\nevery 15 seconds or so, cycling through\r\na
    half-dozen ads on any given occasion...\r\n\r\nthis has even given rise to \"billboards\"\r\nthat
    get updated in real-time, such that\r\nthey say things like \"watch the new episode\r\nof
    'lost' this wednesday night\" right up until\r\nwednesday, when it changes to
    \"tonight\"...\r\n\r\nheck, the other day, during the lakers game,\r\na billboard
    told me the _current_score,_ and\r\nit was only 2 points behind the actual score\r\n--
    which i knew as i was listening on radio --\r\non a basket that was probably made
    _after_\r\nthe billboard was composed and displayed.\r\n\r\nand when that angels
    pitcher was killed in\r\na car accident earlier this year, the angels\r\nhad a
    tribute up on billboard the next day.\r\n\r\nso, exciting new times for billboards,
    but\r\nbillboard painters better find new work...\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The large format printers are solvent based inkjet printers. The solvent
    ink bonds to the vinyl. The largest machines print billboards as a single piece
    on a heavy vinyl banner material. The banner is stretched around the framework
    of the sign.The newest thing is large scale LED billboards that light and are
    changeable similar to the rotators. Rotators are slats covered in adhesive vinyl,
    also digitally printed. The same material is used for vehicle wraps.\r\n\r\nMy
    wife gets a kick out of rotators being stuck or out of sink so that part is one
    message and the other part is another machine.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from
