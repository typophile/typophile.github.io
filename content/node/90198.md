  body: "It could be also <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/geneva/|Geneva]]</strong>
    + the 3D effect.\r\n\r\nmyfont.com says:\r\n<blockquote>Apple system font designed
    as a bitmap by Susan Kare. Its name reflects the intention to imitate those epitomes
    of the Swiss style in type design, Helvetica and Univers.<blockquote>"
