body: This seems like the right place to ask. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for a book
  &#40;or any sort of instruction for that matter&#41; which explains the tools and
  techniques for drawing typefaces by hand. I draw my own comics and don&#39;t want
  to do lettering with a computer. Unfortunately the only new book I have been able
  to find that even touches on the subject just made fun of the old tools that were
  once used for designing and drawing type. <BR> <BR>Anyone?

  body: 'I think you mean <b>lettering</b> as opposed to drawing <b>type.</b> The
    process of drawing letters for type in the old days was more like making a blueprint
    for someone else to follow. If it was for direct reproduction, like for phototype
    headline fonts, the technical process was essentially the same as lettering except
    that the design of the letters was more rigorous owing to the fact that they had
    to be able to be assembled in any arbitrary order. <BR> <BR>Anyway, bj&#39;s suggestion
    looks like a good one in your case, but here are some other books you might want
    to look at &#40;some are probably out of print, though&#41;: <BR> <BR>Speedball

    <BR>There&#39;s also the old Walter Foster book, ABC of Lettering, by Carl Holmes.
    As it was written around 1940, it&#39;s more fun to look at than useful, and it&#39;s
    out of print.

  body: 'Hey, thanks for mentioning that Tommy Thompson book Hrant! I really ought
    to have a copy of it in my library. My current avatar is from another of his books,
    Script Lettering for Artists &#40;Dover reprint of the 1955 edtion revised from
    the original 1939 edition&#41;. Yes, that&#39;s Tommy&#39;s thumb and index finger.
    Man, could that guy draw letters. A lot of his stuff in the Photo-Lettering books.
    <BR> <BR>Another book possibly worth mentioning is Lettering Design: Form &amp;
    Skill in the Design &amp; Use of Letters, by Michael Harvey. Probably not real
    useful for comic book lettering, though.'

    perspective well. It is interesting that all of these categories made a comeback
    when they did. <BR> <BR>I wonder how Mr Denman would chart the current times.
