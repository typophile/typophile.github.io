body: Hi I have an assignment to redesign the logo of Snapple &#40;drink&#41;.  The
  brief is to reclaim the quirkiness of the Snapple attitude - it is a drink that
  doesn&#39;t overpromise &#34;unthink it&#39;s just a drink&#34;. - it is the antithesis
  of drinks that promise life-changing experiences. But it is laid back but fun, unusual,
  natural. <BR> <BR>I have not designed logo&#39;s before. Are there any typefaces/advice
  anyone can recommend? Also, what do you think is the best software for logo design.
  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/63061.gif" alt="logo">
  <BR>please ignore that landscape above the logo ! :D

  body: 'Adobe Illustrator &#40;or vector based drawing programme&#41; is the best
    software to use. While designing you have to think of all the media it might be
    applied to and you may need to change to suit your medium &#40;for example web,
    large and small printing, paper type, embossing &amp;c &amp;c&#41;. There are
    many things to consider, choice/number of colours that can be faithfully reproduced
    in different media '

  body: Make sure your logo does three things. <BR>1. Is relevant to what the company
    stands for. <BR>2. Is original. Make sure it stand out from the company&#39;s
    competitors. <BR>3. Is impactful. People should take notice of the logo when they
    see it.  <BR> <BR>A great site to check out is <a href="http://www.identityworks.com"

    are quite sound. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: Well, yes, my tutor is lazy. We are given progressively harder briefs, and
    taught nothing! <BR>Which is exactly why I posted for help here.

  body: Sounds just like my course. I&#39;d say research a lot into the history of
    the product &#40;launched as an alternative to all the conventional fizzy drinks?&#41;,
    who came up with it initially, and try to recapture the intial ethos of the brand
    &#40;and represent it in graphic form&#41;. <BR> <BR>You could base the logotype
    on an existing typeface, and then draw out rougher versions/variations in pencil
    for a more organic look maybe...

  body: Push back on the professor. This is a brief without any context.  <BR> <BR>&#34;reclaim
    the quirkiness of the Snapple attitude&#34; <BR> <BR>What does that mean? You
    need to force your professor to more clearly define the project. What is the current
    market? What&#39;s the new target market? What&#39;s wrong with the current brand
    system? What is the primary competition? Secondary? Regional markets? etc, etc.

  body: I don&#39;t want to stand-up for the teacher, but sometimes, in the real world,
    your clients won&#39;t give you much more to go on. You could take such a short
    brief as allowing you more freedom.  <BR> <BR>What do you see as quirky? Who do
    you think the target market it? Could it be you? What do you think is quirky?
    Make some lists. Write down all of your thoughts and then start doodling/sketching
    based on those thoughts.
