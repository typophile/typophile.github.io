  I am starting. It's an apparel company where we focus our focus is simple and elegant
  experiences. Right now the logo I've designed is very simple so I need a typeface
  that goes along with it. I want it to be simple and elegant. By that I mean simple
  but looks really good. It must be both, the elegant fonts are not going to do and
  simple to is too broad. \r\n\r\nI really liked Avenir but a friend of mine whose
  opinion I trust turned it down quickly. He said I would like Chalet, which I do
  but I was wondering if any of you have any other suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    is that everyone is using Gotham right now so it's not going to be terribly unique.
    Maybe also check out Whitney or Verlag by [[http://typography.com|H&FJ]]\r\n\r\nThe
    Chalet family has a lot of different styles ranging from Bauhaus to Helvetica-esque.
    I'd just try to avoid Chalet London 1980. I think it ends up looking cheesy most
    of the time (especially if you use a lowercase t).\r\n\r\nI think [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/neutra.shtml|Neutraface]]
    is a very elegant looking sans serif. It's often times used to look a little Art
    Deco if that's appealing to you.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, what was wrong
    with Avenir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read

    popular and he said it doesn't work for what I'm doing. \r\n\r\nThanks for the
    great advice I really Neurtraface and Verlag. Thanks for the great advice. "

  body: "well if Avenir is too popular, then Gotham is WAY too popular. Good luck
    with Neutraface and Verlag. Interesting fact: both were designed to mimic the
    characteristics of famous architects handwriting and/or lettering (Richard Neutra
    and Frank Lloyd Wright). \r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read

  body: "Hi rhyde,\r\nIt seems you have an aesthetic in mind. When I'm at that point,
    I tend to do some freehand sketching in place of the font. I get a few scenarios
    to work with so I can see the graphic & imagery as a whole. At that point, I look
    for something that can be applied to what came naturally. \r\n\r\nIf all your
    work is currently on the screen, output your graphics and try sketching on overlays
    to determine good positioning & weight.\r\n\r\nMike Lee | ReadyType\u2122\r\n\r\n"
