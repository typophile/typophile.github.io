  field and I have no results even with obvious things like 'kerning'.\r\n\r\nIs it
  not working?\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nR. "

  body: "The search box hasn't worked for a couple years at least. The site does get
    spidered by Google, so you can use their advanced search features to find things
    here.\r\n\r\nThough there may be some problems even with that now, since the URL
    structure changed slightly in the recent server upgrade."

    via your favourite search engine.\r\n\r\nGrant Hutchinson has made a little <a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12436\">favelet</a>, for searching Typophile
    via Google:\r\n\r\n<code>javascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',\"));if(q)void(location.href='http://google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))</code>
    \r\n\r\nCopy the code into your address bar and bookmark it. (In some browsers,
    that doesn\u2019t work: You have to create some random bookmark first, and then
    edit it. Set its name to something like \u2018Search Typophile\u2019 and copy
    the code into its adress/location/URL field)  \r\n\r\nJoe, Zara, \u2026: As long
    as Typophile\u2019s internal search doesn\u2019t work and can\u2019t easily be
    fixed/replaced, I\u2019d suggest removing the search box from the template. It
    doesn\u2019t offer anything but a lot of confusion.\r\nF"
