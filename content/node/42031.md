body: "I recently began to teach my granddaughter the alphabet and the sounds of the
  letters and I soon realized that many of the letters that she saw in books were
  different from the ones taught through my teachers' guides (for writing).  Most
  of the fonts in books are or resemble Times New Roman, while most children are taught
  to write one of several styles (D'Nealian, Zaner-Bloser, McDougal/Littel, etc) that
  resemble Arial or Comic Sans MS.  The lower case letters, especially \"a\" and \"g\"
  can be very differently formed.   \r\n\r\nShe needs to be able to recognize the
  Times New Roman \"a\" for reading, but write a different form of \"a\".  I would
  like to explain and show her more about the anatomy of letters.  Is there a typeface
  anatomy poster out there?  If so where can such a poster be purchased?  Alternatively,
  I would be interested in a single page showing typeface anatomy - even one that
  I can print off the Internet.  Thank you for any suggestions.\r\n"

    forms are taught because they are regarded to be easier to learn to write.\r\n\r\nHmmm.
    I've been meaning to write a blog post on this, actually....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    are quite a few that turn up on a google seach. [[http://textwrap.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/character-anatomy.pdf|Here's
    a PDF]] that is good enough to be printed. Do take at the [[http://textwrap.wordpress.com|blog]]
    it came from. You can apparently request for a higher resolution version. \r\n"
