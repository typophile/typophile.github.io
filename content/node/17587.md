  if any of you need a tasty new font for FREE, <a href=\"http://www.thinkalphabits.com/alphafont.html\"
  target=\"new\"><strong>here 'tis</strong></a>.\r\n\r\nThey even have an Alpha-Bits
  font EULA :-)\r\n\r\nPlus they try to educate cereal munching kids about the [[orgins
  of LETTERS]]!<ul><strong>Who Invented Letters?</strong> \r\nWriting hasn't been
  around for very long, relatively speaking of course. It was invented much later
  than drawing and building, but it's just as important.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What I was actually looking for was an article in <em>Money</em> that stated
    General Mills was having problems creating a <em>healthier</em> alternative to
    sugar laden Alpha-Bits by trying whole oats.\r\n\r\nThe problem was the shapes
    would not hold well creating lumpy serifs! LOL! \r\nI wanted to find the actual
    article to post.\r\n\r\nWell, Paul, at least we could add their definition of
    <em>Origin of Letters</em> to the Typowiki."
