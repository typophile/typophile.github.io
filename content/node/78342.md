  Is this possible? I have asked around and searched the web but yet to find a solution.
  Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "ID does not have a proper hanging control.\r\n\r\nIn regular text you can
    combine a left indent with a first line negative indent to simulate this \u2013a
    solution valid just for the paragraph opening. The other resource is to activate
    optical adjust for margins \u2013again, a very limited procedure for achieve hanging
    aligment, useful most for quotes and capitular swashes.\r\n\r\nIn a table, the
    same limitations from regular text are also present. You can just simulate the
    hanging effect placing the brackets in a thin first column and the remaining text
    is the next one. A sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/idtable_4112.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Example
    above shows optical margins adjust working in table. Table below pretends a hanging
    aigment with additional column at left.</em>"

  body: "I'd probably use the first method that Freiberger suggested -- left indent
    with negative first line indent. I'd create a style sheet for that formatting
    and apply it to all paragraphs that begin with a bracket. \r\n\r\nIf you also
    have some paragraphs in that table that don't start with a bracket, I'd create
    a separate style sheet for them that was identical except it didn't have the 1st
    line negative indent. \r\n\r\nIf the bracket is not on the paragraph's first line,
    you'll need to put a hard break at the end of the line above it, so that InDesign
    views the bracketed line as the start of a new paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
