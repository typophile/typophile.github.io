  body: "There is no apostrophe in \"its\" when used as a posessive pronoun.\r\nIf
    in doubt, ask yourself whether the text would make sense with the apostrophe replaced

  body: On the other hand, SaveGirl101 topic "Credit where its due" is also incorrect,
    as there, the "its" is a contraction of "it is," ain't it?

    at Typophile. Would you be willing to share a few kilobytes in response to my
    ill crafted question above? I would be very happy if you did. \r\n\r\n"

    the author is a journalist who focuses on the more sensational aspects of type
    design."
