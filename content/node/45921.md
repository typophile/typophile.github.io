body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've been working on a design and have run into a problem
  which I've been unable to remedy. I'm hoping that someone might have some suggestions
  on how to go about tracking down the source of this problem since I am at a lost.
  I realise it's a bit of a longshot, but perhaps someone has encountered a similar
  problem in the past and this rings some bells.\r\n\r\nI'm using FontLab Studio 5.0.4/MacOS
  10.5.2\r\n\r\nWhen I generate my font as a Postscript-flavoured OpenType font, I
  get no error messages, but when attempting to install the font in FontExplorer X,
  I get a message that the font is corrupt (this message is an OS-level message, not
  a font-explorer message). Sometimes it will instantly deactivate, other times it
  will not. In the latter case, the font will show up in the font menu, but when I
  attempt to use it certain glyphs will be missing (that is they appear blank; they
  do not show up as the .notdef character). This includes several of the base glyphs
  (i.e. ones with unicode values) and all alternate glyphs (ones without unicode values
  which should be appearing when various OT features are active). Nothing appears
  to be wrong with any of these glyphs in the FontLab file.\r\n\r\nIf I generate the
  font as a TrueType-flavoured font, everything works fine.\r\n\r\nI have attempted
  to copy all of the glyphs into a new .vfb file, but get the same results.\r\n\r\nIf
  I open generated .otf font in FontLab and regenerate it, then I get a font which
  does not report errors when installed and which does not exhibit any of the problems
  outlined above. However, if one embeds this font in a .pdf file, the .pdf file will
  be replete with .notdef symbols, incorrect glyphs, etc. so obviously something is
  still wrong.\r\n\r\nI realise that debugging someone else's font based only on the
  above is probably a tall order, but on the off chance that it suggests some known
  issue I thought I'd ask.\r\n\r\nI don't want to generate the font as a .ttf file
  since that would basically require that I redo all of the hinting in the font.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions appreciated,\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: Put the font through some of these [[Font Validation Software]] tools and
    I'm sure you'll find the problem. Also, the problem might not be directly related
    with the VFB but with the way the font is being generated, in which case you may
    have to tweak FontLab's preferences. Hope this helps.

  body: "Thanks Miguel,\r\n\r\nfontQA found the problem -- my cedilla and ogonek were
    resulting in overlapping contours when certain composites were being decomposed
    -- an easily remedied problem.\r\n\r\nIt also identified a number of other issues,
    though, which I was unaware <em>were</em> issues, and which don't seem to be producing
    any negative effects that I am aware of of. I was wondering if anyone could explain
    to me why the following may be problematic:\r\n\r\n<ol> <li>Multiple suffixes:
    I have characters which include names like \"Q.smcp.swsh\", which seem sensible
    to me, but which fontQA thinks are problematic.</li> <li> (2) Suffixed names with
    unicode assignments: I have assigned unicode values to certain glyph variants,
    e.g. \"two.sinf\" has been assigned U+2082 which seems sensible to me.</li> </ol>\r\n\r\nWhat
    unanticipated consequences might arise from either of the above?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "@1: These names are okay, FontQA just complains because it checks the names
    against an old FSI internal naming convention.\r\n\r\n@2: Because the inferior
    2 is a glyph that doesn't have a \"friendly name\" as defined in the AGLFN, it
    should be named uni2082 (its unicode value prefixed with \"uni\"). Otherwise certain
    systems (i.e. Mac OS X) which rely on the glyph names will have problems accessing
    this glyph. Your name \"two.sinf\" suggests that you use this glyph with the \"sinf\"
    OT feature. Of course you can still do that when the glyph is named \"uni2082\".\r\n\r\nJens"

    see\r\n\r\n<cite>Step 1: drop all the characters from the glyph name starting
    with the first occurrence of a period (U+002E FULL STOP), if any.</cite>\r\n\r\nSo
    your second period in G.smcp.swash won't show. Not really an issue, since from
    a PDF, the glyph so named will map to a cap G, which is probably what you want
    anyway. "

    will do the right thing when encountering multiple periods in a glyph name. That
    being said, if it were me I wouldn't go there, under the assumption that some

    gain you much.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
