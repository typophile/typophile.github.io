  body: Most employers like to see 1 page with just the facts. Maybe think about how
    you could make it as simply as possible, using just typography. I would resist
    the urge to get too creative with your resume -- it's an opportunity to show your
    information design skills, not your illustration skills.

  body: I agree, and I think the reader will be more impressed if you can convey clear
    organization just through the arrangement of text (and images on the examples
    page) alone (i.e. without boxes, extra slashes, etc.)

  body: "Separate your CV and your portfolio. They should be documents that can stand
    on their own individually.\r\n\r\nLoose the gradients, stretched boxes, etc. Anything
    put on here should be done with purpose...not just to decorate."

  body: "Having sifted through CVs on a number of occasions in order to compile a
    shortlist I can honestly say that, as FeeltheKern says, one side of A4 is massively
    preferable.\r\n\r\nShort and to the point. Make the design readable and simple.
    You should be aiming to outline your skills and achievements and offer information
    on referees and suchlike.\r\n\r\nI generally skim multi-page CVs which means I
    may overlook something vital I admit but when one has a pile of 50-100 job applications
    time is of the essence.\r\n\r\nOh, and one other thing, you have spelled 'halloween'
    incorrectly on your examples page."

  body: "What Darrel (aluminum) said. And after that, you might consider changing
    the hyphens in the date ranges to en-dashes, and the hyphens at the front of each
    list item to bullets. Restricting the ellipsis (\"I enjoy...\") to just three
    dots (or indeed switching to a colon). A close-bracket after the Media Studies
    grade, etc. A general proofread and typographical tidy-up, in other words.\r\n\r\nSome
    employers won't notice or care about typographic niceties, but you can bet your
    bottom dollar that the one you <em>really</em> want to work with <em>will</em>.
    And obviously you want to, since you've posted here!\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
