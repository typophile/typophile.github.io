body: Hello All, <BR> <BR>I was hoping to get some help with these. The first one
  is used by Wired Magazine all the time. The second and third were featured in the
  latest magazine--the blockish/woodtype one was on the cover.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35007.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR>Often used to head their pages. It resembles FF Magda but many characters
  are completely different. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35008.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR>Woodcut type that looks strangely familiar.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35009.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR>I thought this was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontkingz/affront/"
  target="_blank">affront</a> since it had the same feel and the same C when I saw
  it on Myfonts. But clearly it&#39;s not it.  <BR> <BR>

  body: The third is closest to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/nasalization/">Nasalization</a>,
    though that M is more like the Omni magazine M that you can see in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6895.html">this
    thread</a>.

  body: It&#39;s the &#34;R&#34; in the 3rd sample that&#39;s going to be hard to
    match, methinks.

  body: It isn&#39;t a match, but the third sample is <BR>similar to Matt Desmond&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/testpilot/er9/extra-bold/testdrive.html?s=DReAM&amp;p=72">ER9</a>.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;The R is in the same style, but the M isn&#39;t quite.&#41;

  body: 'Thanks so much for the help everyone! I really appreciate it. I was reading
    on lineto&#39;s site &#40;<i>Thanks Mark</i>&#41; that it actually <b>was</b>
    based on FF Magda. I want to own so many of Lineto&#39;s fonts &#40;and they seem
    to come up constantly here&#41; but they&#39;re expensive for anyone who doesn&#39;t
    run a magazine! &#40;$136 US for a single weight! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> &#41;  <BR> <BR>Anyway, Blessed &#40;<i>Impressive work
    Karl!</i>&#41; matches the OMNI magazine masthead pretty closely that was mentioned
    in that other thread. One would almost think it was an expansion of it, especially
    with so many of the same characters.   <BR> <BR>And I knew Emigre&#39;s Brother&#39;s
    looked familiar. I have it on the &#34;O Brother Where Art Thou&#34; CD &#40;great
    CD, BTW&#41;. '
