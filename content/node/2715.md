    japanese type foundry called kinemamoon and the name of the font is &#34;ito&#34;
    which is #20 on their website. check em out at kinemamoon.com. lemme know if you
    think this is the one. just one problem... the site is in jappanese and unforutnately,
    i haven&#39;t been able to figgure out how to order the fonts they advertise on
    this site. anyhow... g&#39;luck!'

    bjork vespertine thread</a>. I am still suspicious though that ito might be a
    reverse engineered typeface.

  body: you know what... i guess i identified the above posted type face correctly,
    but after looking at the other threads about the face used for vespertine, i readily
    agree that the one shown above is not the real deal. it comes close... but not
    quite the beauty that graces bj

    I wasn&#39;t annoyed at you at all.  <BR>I don&#39;t know if you interpreted my

    grumpy  <BR>on the other thread. &#40;I mean I did all this work and  <BR>he doesn&#39;t
    even <i>remember</i> the friggin&#39; tutorial. Ugh!&#41;
