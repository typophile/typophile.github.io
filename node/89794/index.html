  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

A little while ago, on this very site, Nick Shinn commented 'I do believe that "non-transformable" glyph shapes are inherently more legible than those which can be transformed into other characters simply by rotating or flipping. Which gives serifed type the advantage.'

I would agree with this, but can anyone suggest any non-transformable serif typefaces that fit this task? 

Thanks

The Dutch papers have been full of the dyslexie typeface, thinking it's the holy grail. While I agree that the approach has some arguments, the design solutions are the easy way out and ugly (of course help it get noticed) 

With more research, effort and knowledge about type, you could create something much better.

Do you mean they talk about it a lot, or have actually been <em>using</em> it.

much attention. What about helping <em>everybody</em>
read better? Is that too boring, or too difficult?

I would put this alongside chirographic type forms, i.e. it's something that makes type easier to read, which can't be measured (just as sans vs. serif can't be determined which is best scientifically).

At any rate, non-minimal forms persist, whether for measurable legibility reasons or not.</div>

Just publicity, but to quite a degree. I mean, the designer did a good job marketing it, but the construction... There have been some books marketed towards dyslectics printed with the typeface though. And they seem to sell to schools. (which doesn't please all the dyslexia specialists)

There has been heaps of research into legibility and the serif vs sans battle, but real conclusive research is found sparsely, and most of them contradict each other again. But that distinctive letters aid reading does help, and for dyslectic, breaking the rhythm does as well.</div>

If you mean that chirographic forms are
easier to read, then of course I disagree.

> just as sans vs. serif can't be determined which is best scientifically

It <em>hasn't</em> been determined scientifically... yet.
I believe it can be, and there's a chance one day it will.

In any case, not having Proof doesn't excuse us from
relying on the accumulated anecdotal* wisdom that
serifs provide a readability advantage.

* A term I personally use in a positive sense.

> breaking the rhythm does as well.

This helps everybody.
In fact if a text font has a visible rhythm, it's not a Real text font.

		<div class="commentbody">In this case, when talking about flipping and mirroring, there is actual evidence to the contrary. It's not a case of lack of evidence.

But as I said, this does not mean that all the choices one would make because of that hypothesis are wrong or bad; there are other reasons one could argue for things like the two-story "a" and so on.

		<div class="commentbody">> the Dutch trend toward impractical high-concept design

Interesting observation, expressed better than I've managed in
the past. Maybe the Dutch went so far ahead in good design that
now it's all imploding in abstraction. A good example in the type
world is the delusional infatuation with upright italics.

> lay claim to legibility techniques that have been around for ages.

There is however a difference between using one's instincts to
design something readable versus using empirical science as a
formal guide (even though the stuff is still thin on the ground).

Oh yes, don't get me started about the ecofont. Even if drilling holes in a typeface would save ink, wouldn't it better to create it out of dots due to the inkflow? Try to get that across to people. Or the existence of light weights.

		<div class="commentbody">Read Regular was a Helen Hamlyn research project instigated by a Dutch student at the RCA some years back. It was never released because the designer did not want it in the 'wrong hands'. The typeface was tested to be used for optimal legibility purposes only in conjunction with 'correct' typesetting. I guess the only person to be able to typeset it 'correctly' was the student herself. Although I am not dyslexic myself I have read a book typeset in Read Regular and I find it incredibly easy to read. I don't find it 'ugly' at all and I think it's a fantastic project with a real purpose of trying to improve people's lives and their experiences of reading... It may not be perfect, but opens up a lot of debate and avenues for other type designers to explore.</div>

Indeed a good thing. And I certainly agree that aesthetics
in text fonts is over-rated. And this is all why I started my
alphabet reform work in the late 90s.
