  body: Ack. I know this one. But I can't remember the name. I'm pretty sure it is
    an ITC font. But, then again, Mark or Mike will come along and correct me and
    help you. ;^)

  body: You are welcome, Nathalie. But I didn't post in the Lindt-topic, that was
    Jesse Phillips (jpolo_9) who asked you. And your answer clears all. Good luck
    with your children's project!
