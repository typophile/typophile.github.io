body: "It's music festival time, and festivals mean lots of ads in the papers. In
  my native country, Norway, these music festival ads have been dominated by an overuse
  of Rosewood Fill the last few years. Looking at a paper with five or six ads for
  various festivals, one could get the impression that they were all made by the same
  designer, but I doubt that is the case. Is this a trend, laziness, everyone trying
  to copy other people's designs or what? And what is the situation like in other
  countries whereas music related ads is concerned? Is there more variety?\r\n\r\nFrankly
  I'm getting fed up with Rosewood Fill. It's a shame. The typeface is rather sweet."

    at a newspaper. MANY of the ads were all designed in-house. Many of the local
    weeklies still appear to do a lot of in-house ad design. You can certainly tell
    their 3 favorite fonts as they show up in about half the ads. ;o)"

    applications. So almost every designer has it! I love it; I even wrote a little
    article about it for the most-recent issue of [[Slanted]]: http://www.typeoff.de/?p=48'

    manually, which is something that many people skip.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s getting a
    lot of love here in Finland, too. I\u2019m not fed up, though. It\u2019s just
    not nice to see it set with the \u2018default\u2019 kerning."

  body: "I notice that hardly anyone uses the Chromatic woodtypes as intended: 2 layers.\r\n\r\nI
    put the final outlines together for the Chromatic Woodtype set. The spacing and
    kerning for Rosewood was done to make the ornamented version look right. When
    Adobe released the Chromatic Woodtypes, they thought that probably someone would
    try to use one of the fill fonts alone, but that they would see how bad the proportions,
    weights and spacing looked without the ornamented layer, and use something else.
    \r\n\r\nYou never know what will be done with a typeface once it's released."

    seen people slapping these typefaces all over stuff tied into the 1910s, 20s,

    Often in an ad where the advertiser (or advertiser's wife/4 year old daughter)
    has designed the ad.
