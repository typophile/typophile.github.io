  past, my appologies.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know how some of you actually start to design
  a typeface. What are your procedures when designing and developing? I guess I would
  just like to know how it's done and maybe get a few pointers so I can set out designing.\r\n\r\nI
  figure once I have a couple hand sketches done, I would translate them to Illustrator
  to refine and then something like TypeTool to assemble it? I don't know - please
  let me know how YOU do it!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nBrian"

  body: I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logo-Font-Lettering-Bible-Comprehensive/dp/1581804369">this
    book</a>, and got some really good pointers. I've never designed an entire typeface
    before, but that book helped me when I design my own letters and reshape existing
    fonts for my logos.

    good answers but the first way to begin to get effective & useful answers is to
    narrow the question. And actually that will be my 1st step. What is the purpose
    of the type? Answer that question well, and thoughtfully & you will have a chance
    of doing something worthwhile. Otherwise - Maybe not so much. "

  body: "The way one starts on a new font depends too much on the given purpose at
    hand and the nature of the given designer for any elaboration to be highly useful
    to you in particular. If you try to follow somebody else's methods too closely
    you are likely to become confused and lost in the long term.\r\n\r\nIf, like Eben
    says, you can focus on a specific purpose (and I would add factor in your own
    creative nature) then the <cite>technical</cite> advice we might be able/willing
    to provide should help you get to somehere meaningful (to you) faster and better.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
