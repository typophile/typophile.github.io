    target="_blank">Newut</a> has some similarities, particularly the &#39;J&#39;.

  body: Thanks anyway Stephen. It&#39;s looking more and more like a custom font.
    whatthefont and identifont came up with nothing. whatthefont couldn&#39;t even
    recognise the uppercase M or J.  <BR> <BR>Someone prove the custom font idea wrong...?

  body: It looks to me like this is a modified version of Helvetica. Most of the characters
    &#40;like the S&#41; look just like Helvetica, but others &#40;like the G and
    R&#41; which have a different overall form are not as well-drawn and, in fact,
    look like crudely modified Helvetica characters. At least to my eye.

  body: 'I&#39;d go along with that Mark. It looks like GTF have made a modified version
    of Helvetica for theDM with a selection of uppercase and lowercase letters being
    altered &#40;u and a &#43; J,M,G, and R&#41;. The bowl on the R feels very awkward.  <BR>
    <BR>I love the overall feel of it though. Adds a nice twist.  <BR> <BR>The Milli
    ID uses the same modified M, but the rest of the letters remain unaltered Helvetica.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for your thoughts.  '

  body: 'That&#39;s a most accurate guess! Thank you.  <BR> <BR>I still think they
    may have combined fonts on both identities though. The lowercase L in the case
    of the Design Museum is different to the l in all weights of Schulbud. '
