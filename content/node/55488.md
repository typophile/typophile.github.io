  logotype. What typefaces would you recommend for the logotype? One that works well
  with Vag Rounded. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help."

  body: Ideally you design the logo first, the slogan is a secondary element. If you
    like Vag Rounded, I would use it for the logo as well. Otherwise if you really
    want a 2nd typeface tell us a bit more about what the logo is for.

    the logo first.. But, due to the nature of things, the logo is coming second...\r\n\r\nBesides
    Vag Rounded, what else would you use?\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "Chirs, the logo is for a consumer product (a notebook). Sorry for being vague,
    but I've signed a NDA.\r\n\r\nVAG rounded for marketing collateral. \r\n\r\n...Now
    thinking of cutting Vag Rounded to make the logo.\r\n\r\nBy the way, thanks Nick
    for the Softmachine suggestion. I really like it!  And all the other typefaces
    you have created. Great work.\r\n\r\nFor this situation Softmachine is too playful.\r\n\r\nI
    need suggestions for other, more serious, and more corporate typefaces that would
    work with Vag Rounded.\r\n\r\nAnd I need suggestions for a Mac - PC default typeface
    to work with Vag Rounded. Perhaps this default typeface could be that more corporate
    typeface..\r\n\r\nMuch thanks for your assistance thus far.\r\n\r\nLook forward
    to hearing what you guys think."
