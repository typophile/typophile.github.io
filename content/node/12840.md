  a English/Russian book, I'm going to design. Any ideas of high quality independant
  foundries providing these. \r\nI thought about the Fedra Pro from Peter Bi\u013Eak
  of the Fedra Serif A?\r\nAny other ideas?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help, \r\n\r\nNicolas"

    (that is, \u201Chigh-quality\u201D). What about \u201Cindependent foundries\u201D?
    Independent from whom? Or from what? "

  body: "ok, \r\n\r\nSorry for being not precise enough.\r\nIndependant means like:
    LucasFont, Processtype, PsyOps or others.\r\nI want to invest money directly to
    the designer who made the font not to big corporation like Adobe, Agfa\u2026\r\nGood
    quality means: wide character sets (thin, light, italic, medium, bold), fine tuning
    in the characters approaches already made, linear and non linear numbers\u2026\r\nI'm
    not sure yet what to use; serif or sansserif.\r\nThe book is a world fair art
    catalogue. It's not highly contemporary but if I'm buying a complete font for
    this work, I'm planning to use the font for other upcoming works too.\r\nI was
    intentionally \"vague\". I wanted to have a good Roman AND Cyrillic font list
    first and then affine the choice later on.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nNicolas"

  body: well, just off the top of my head, i think <a href="http://houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=3">Chalet</a>
    by [[House Industries]] would foot the bill. I personally wouldn't choose it for
    long texts(I wouldn't choose any sans for long texts but that's just me), but
    if this is a catalog, i'm assuming the texts are short and this might just fit
    the bill.

  body: 'I admire House Industries for a lot of things: their fantastic sense of style;
    their great taste; their innovative approach to type design (e.g., in Ed Interlock);
    the great usability and beauty of their latest release, Paperback; but <em>not</em>
    for their Cyrillics. Chalet Cyrillic does not feel authentic (and yes, you can
    read it). You can compare the feeling to those Latin glyphs that are routinely
    included in the Japanese fonts: they look <em>foreign</em>. If you want real quality
    and authenticity, ParaType Cyrillics are your best bet.'
