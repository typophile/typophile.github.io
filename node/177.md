body: Hi all. <BR> <BR>This is last friday&#39;s effort from my Friday Fonts campaign.
  I&#39;m continuing to work on my <BR>grotesque, but needed a break. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  based on a photo I took of an antique child&#39;s toy. The original was woodburned
  so I  <BR>tried to keep some of that appeal. Hopefully it still has some appeal.
  When I eventually  <BR>revamp my website, I was thinking of maybe offering it as
  a free font. Or should I try  <BR>to sell it? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your thoughts,
  <BR>Randy <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10941.gif" alt="AT

  body: Randy, i&#39;m inspired by your Friday Fonts campaign. Keep it up man. <BR>
    <BR>This is cool and would be great for the indie music scene, among other stuff.
    And that background is killa. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something already out there,
    just fyi. <BR> <BR><a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/capn.html" target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/fontner/capn.html</a>

    What do you think this is, the  <BR>ID forum? :-&#41; Well, I suspected there
    are other type hounds out there sniffing for alphabets.  <BR>Thanks for the link.
    I particularly like the rubber stamp fonts.  <BR> <BR>I was thinking of including
    the background ornaments in the font. They came from a box  <BR>of Korean tea
    I inherited. <BR> <BR>Randy'
