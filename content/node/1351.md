    font</a> &#40;available for free from saulbass.net&#41; based on Saul Bass&#39;
    hand printing. It&#39;s not very similar to the Vertigo titles but might also
    be of interest for you... <BR> <BR>A Mac version is also available on the same
    site.

    WELL. Bass directed a short sequence in Vertigo. <BR>and Paramonunt didn&#39;t
    censor his artwork. rare thing!!!&#41;  <BR> <BR>so. about the typeface - the

    border=0> <BR>Identifications for custom/commissioned designs  <BR>only get credited
    when someone can pinpoint by  <BR>whom the design is. This means a number of IDs  <BR>which
    we are almost 100% sure of they&#39;re custom  <BR>don&#39;t get regarded as positive
    IDs. This hurts our  <BR>stats, BUT I think it&#39;s fairer. <BR> <BR>BJ was the
    first poster who mentionned Saul Bass,  <BR>so he gets credited. You get co-credited
    solely  <BR>because I&#39;m in a good mood today. Consider this  <BR>&#34;abuse
    of power&#34;. So sue me. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/lol.gif"
