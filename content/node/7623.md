body: This client creates greeting cards with flowery designs on the front. Each card
  is handmade and one card is different than the other. <BR> <BR>The objective is
  to design a logo that would capture the originality of these greeting cards, and
  yet be general enough to be placed on similar products as well, e.g. large flower
  pictures. <BR> <BR>This logo is meant to be placed on the backside of the greeting
  cards. <BR> <BR>I would appreciate some feedback on the following draft. <BR> <BR>For
  now I have kept it all one colour, to concentrate on shape and balance, but also
  because the logo might alternatively be embossed on the cards. <BR> <BR>Thanks all
  for your help! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53252.gif"

    and see how much nicer things look when you have a lot of thick-thin variation.

  body: If your going to use it small or embossed the thin strokes on the name might
    be lost. You might consider making two logos. One for sizes x plus and a heavier
    stroked version for sizes x minus

    symbol you are using. Try either change the face or change the symbol. <BR>The
    symbol looks more like a small flower, which is just starting to grow. The placement
    of the flower looks forced to me. Try a more subtle positioning. <BR> <BR>Note
    : If you try to lower the upper part of the flower in order to create an &#34;R&#34;
    it may lead to a feeling of shrinking and lack of energy. <BR> <BR>Salute'

    pushed the head to the top a little and made it rounder - cheers, Hrant. <BR>
    <BR>For now, let&#39;s try changing the face and see what comes out of it. One
    consideration though: I don&#39;t want it to look too exclusive or elegant either
    - the cards should also appeal to the younger generation &#40;~30ish&#41; Is that
    attraction maybe lost with Minion Italic? Feedback appreciated: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53375.gif"

  body: 'I prefer the first version of the design with the font &#34;Spring LP Std&#34;,
    but as you may know the &#34;LP&#34; is a trademark of LetterPerfect Design. <BR>In
    general Spring is contemporary font of the 90s and depicts the contemporary spirit
    of that period.  <BR>  &#34;Minion&#34; even though a great balanced font would
    not work good for you on this logotype.  <BR>  The flower stands quite ackward
    with Minion. As I said before you might need a different positioning. <BR>  Maybe
    try some of the following : ITC Edwardian Script , Florens LP Std, Lucida Calligraphy
    &#40;Handwriting&#41; or even Script MT Std. <BR> <BR>Salute'

  body: It all depends on what the emphasis should be. The first post has an equal
    balance between the word and the logo. This makes the logo feel less important
    the Minion version puts more emphasis on the logo which inturn feels extra special.
    I feel like the first version almost doesn&#39;t need the logo because the script
    is so graphic in itself. I myself prefer the Minion version <BR>&#40;although
    I&#39;m not convinced on the italic.&#41; By introducing Minion or a similar text/display
    face you will visually be able to connect the logo with other design elements
    within your identity &#40;ie buisness card font, letterhead type, and whatever
    else you would need a hard working serif style typeface.&#41; I think the memorability
    of the logo will come from the special r symbol you have created. The script is
    also hard to read at small sizes. Not to mention if the script is set in 10 point
    it will appear completely phony and reproduced. Conceptually if a script isn&#39;t
    printed at a handwritting size than I feel it is being used wrong. However that
    is my extremest opinion. Again, in my opinion, The Minion Version has more potential
    to be a solid identity.

  body: I should agree with David. This curvy symbol doesn&#39;t need a curvy wordmark,
    I would even suggest using a regular instead of italic. And to push the envelope
    further, why don&#39;t you use something like Gill Sans Light <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53404.gif"

  body: Ivan you might be right about using a non-handwriting script but I advise
    Samann to come up with a  different logo symbol. As I said before either the script
    or the symbol has to be changed. The sans serif might be a good idea for that
    symbol, but I don&#39;t like the interplay with Minion neither the highly tracked/kerned
    variations of Ivan. <BR> <BR>Salute <BR> <BR>p.s. I like the thinned version of
    the flowery symbol more.

- body: One of your main objectives you said is to relate to how each card had a certain
    amount of individuality/originality. Since the cards are being handmade, what
    if you stamped the logo? &#40;Just the shape.&#41; The printing inconsistencies
    would be great. If the type were printed, it would make a nice contrast. <BR>
    <BR>The logo and type right now aren&#39;t making a really good cohesive shape..
    what if you had all caps spaced a little widely and planted the stem in between
    the letters? The shape could vary position between different letters maybe, adding
    more individuality to the logo &amp; cards. <BR> <BR>With the logo, it still seems
    like it needs more contrast. The leaf isn&#39;t really separating properly at
    the bottom and the bulb is a little large compared to the rest. Look at different
    fleurons or art nouveau patterns for inspiration? <BR> <BR>Keep us posted!

  body: 'Thanks everyone for all your wonderful comments. I have had time to work
    on this a little more again. <BR> <BR>Have a look at the latest update. I added
    the rectangle to solve some positioning problems between the logo and the wordmark.
    Conceptually I think it works well because it is emphasising the nature of the
    business: greeting cards. <BR>Brian had a nice idea about stamping the logo. This
    needs to be tested, but it might work even better with the rectangle around it.
    I just hope that it won&#39;t look too cheap. Otherwise I fear that people might
    not &#34;get&#34; that it&#39;s actually a feature. <BR> <BR>Please give me your
    feedback on the latest version. Also, which one works better? black on white or

  body: Samann. I don&#39;t find there to be enough contrast between symbol and type
    ... Gill Light works more for that. As for placement, I think the square/rectangle
    causes more problems that it solves. You lose the organic quality of the symbol.
    Is it important that you box it in?

  body: 'Good point about the type, Tiffany. I could agree that some more contrast
    might not be bad. Regarding the box: You have to imagine this printed fairly small
    on the back of a greeting card. I printed it out at that size and the white on
    black version &#40;the one I am leaning more towards&#41; looks very nice IMO,
    especially when seen from a distance. the box does catch your eye.. <BR> <BR>I
    like that the format of the box resembles the format of the greeting card and
    the flower on it describes the flowers on the actual cards.  <BR> <BR>How do others
    feel about it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not entirely happy about the shape yet. Maybe
    I could go for smaller details. A little bit like the new Unilever U.   <BR> <BR>more

  body: In your earlier posts what I saw, and found to be very nice, was a flower
    growing out of the type .. this new version is completely devoid of that. I understand
    needing to be printed very small on the back of a card. However, I don&#39;t think
    it needs to be boxed in. You can play with scale for that. The type &#40;ground&#41;
    can be larger while the flower &#40;r&#41; is smaller, or vice versa, depending
    upon the situation.

  body: Like Tiffany said, <BR> <BR>Make the type larger and the symbol smaller or
    vise versa. If the type is smaller than you might want to make it bolder. The
    symbol is cool, it deifinatly should be very prominant.

    have to be boxed in. However, I would prefer to find a solution that fits all
    sizes.  <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve made a small version, to get a better feel for
    the small print; from left to right the symbol gets more and more dominant. it&#39;s
    still quite rough, but just to get an idea: which relationship logo/wordmark relationship
    should I go forward? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53912.gif"
