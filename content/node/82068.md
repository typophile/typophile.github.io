  branding of the National Theatre of Greece (used in all their publications as well
  as in their logo). Here is their website [[http://www.n-t.gr/en]]\r\nThe website
  of the designers of the new brand [[http://www.mnpdesign.gr/]]\r\n\r\nI also include
  some visuals. (Note the particularity of the uppercase R in the logo or the lowercase
  b in the English tagline)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LogoNationalTheaterEnglish_6707.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/taglineEnglishSeason20102011_3906.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/taglineGreekSeason20102011_5106.png]"
