body: Hi Folks! <BR> <BR>Maybe some of you are asking themselves the same thing...
  <BR> <BR>Does InDesign CS support Unicode? With InDesign 2, I just tried to write
  something in Hangul &#40;Korean&#41; with the Seoul font. The Glyph Palette shows
  the characters, but when I use PowerInput that came with Jaguar, and works in all
  of my newer apps, I get crippled %$

  body: Unicode input in InDesign 2.0 on the Mac is not really feasible. It was deisnged
    around the lowest-common-denominator APIs that work on both OS 9 and OS X.  <BR>
    <BR>The new version may fix all or part of this problem. Try installing the free
    tryout version of CS and see if that works better. Alternately, try the Windows
    version of the program.

  body: The first thing to remember is that &#34;supporting Unicode&#34; is not a
    simple yes-or-no affair. <BR> <BR>With that in mind, every version of InDesign
    has used a Unicode based text engine. However, that is a separate question from
    compatibility with OS X text input methods. In previous versions of InDesign,
    it has often been the case that one could import text for certain languages, but
    not enter it directly in the application. <BR> <BR>I believe that InDesign CS
    has done a much better job of working with arbitrary Unicode-based keyboards,
    such as those which come with OS X or can be created by end users &#40;using an
    XML-based syntax&#41;. However, I am not familiar with &#34;PowerInput&#34; so
    I can&#39;t say whether that in particular works. <BR> <BR>John&#39;s suggestion
    about the tryout version is a good one, except that AFAIK the tryout isn&#39;t
    available yet for InD CS. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    one extrapolate from the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/tryadobe/download.jsp?ftpID=2350">Photoshop
    CS tryout</a>?

  body: I&#39;d just wait Adobe just released the GoLive CS tryout version I bet its
    only a short time before InDesign CS tryout is available. Darn Thomas its too
    bad Adobe gave up on Live Motion. I liked that application.

  body: If that doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s always importing a Unicode text file.
    Or a Microsoft RTF file. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thomas, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but don&#39;t InDesign, Photoshop
    and Illustrator CS share the same type engine? If so, the Photoshop and Illustrator
    tryouts should be valid tests.

  body: They all use the same type engine which handles how the applications access
    fonts and the glyphs within those fonts. Illustrator and Photoshop even use the
    same text layout engine &#40;which is a separate component&#41;. However, compatibility
    with input methods and clipboards are still partly separate issues. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: <i>However, compatibility with input methods and clipboards are still partly

    Character Palette in Jaguar and Panther, and you type in a little box, almost
    like a line caster that copy &amp; pastes everything after you press Space or
    Enter, to the foreground application, I don&#39;t see much difference. <BR> <BR>Happy
    2004! <BR>F <BR>--- <BR>But since I&#39;m a bit of an Adobist I&#39;ll get the
    CS suite anyways ;&#41;
