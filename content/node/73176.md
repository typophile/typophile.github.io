  body: The description, otherwise known as "romance copy," doesn't necessarily bear
    any resemblance to reality, and I can't see that Vitesse has any of the qualities
    it touts any more than, say http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/city-be/ , to
    which it bears more than a passing resemblance...

  body: Ok. It just seemed as though alternatives seemed a little to different than
    Vitesse.
