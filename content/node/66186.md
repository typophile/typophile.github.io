    work--it's just a path to the file on your computer, which will only work on your
    computer.\r\n\r\nTry using the \"Insert image\" link below the \"Comment:\" box
    here. Also, be sure to change the file name so there are no spaces in it. Spaces
    are not allowed and the upload will fail."
