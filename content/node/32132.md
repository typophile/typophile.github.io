  it's Bell Gothic, but it just doesn't seem right for some reason. Can anyone help?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  as an aside, does anyone know off the top of their head what I am looking at for
  the actual film logo. No real reason really, just would be interesting to know.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

    here</a> last week, but the final verdict was only <cite>(a) a very nice grunge-style
    hybrid sans and (b) a custom designed logo/typeface.</cite>
