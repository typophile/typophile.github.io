  my first typeface and think am reaching a point at which feedback could be extremely
  useful!\r\n\r\nMy starting point for drawing this alphabet was to draw each character
  twice with a flat brush: once at a 0\xB0 angle to get the horizontal stress I wanted
  to go for and define the inner shapes of the letters, the second time at a 45\xB0
  angle to stress the outer shapes of the letters.\r\nNeedless to say this is quite
  Bloemsma-inspired :)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/1136/53336116.jpg\">\r\n\r\nHere
  is how it looks like as of today:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/766/poster2l.jpg\">\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance for any critiques!"

  body: "Jules, this is very interesting. Needless to say, you now have to vectorize
    these shapes disregarding most of the artifacts of the brush. Keep those that
    add value, kill those that doesn\u2019t. (Some of those I would explore are the
    cuts in V/W/A and similar shapes \u2014 why not also in M and N?, also top left
    R/D/P.) Look to Ourtype\u2019s Meran and H&FJ\u2019s Whitney for reference. Another
    face that evokes a similar feeling is Antique Olive, and obviously Bloemsma\u2019s
    own Balance.\r\n\r\nYour signature letters, a/g/e, all needs more work. The latter
    is perhaps not so bad \u2014 maybe it just needs even more exaggeration \u2014
    but the two former are too unbalanced and too clunky. S/s spine would usually
    need more weight, but in this case: who knows. I think that one is also a matter
    of not doing the wrong thing clearly enough. (Think of it like actor\u2019s lines
    and movements on a stage!). G-chin. I\u2019ve seen it done in an old antique grotesque.
    I personally don\u2019t think it works here. h/m looks narrow to me, at least
    compared to u. Where did all the crazyness go in x/y/z? H narrow. P bowl, maybe
    bigger? K/k: puh-lease! And the list goes on, but I\u2019d address those first.\r\n\r\n"

    works okay, but they do seem to be falling leftward a bit."

  body: "Regarding this font, I agree with Frank here. You really need to make it
    look less written and more drawn. Strictly copied calligraphic letters tent to
    not be subtle enough to work as printed letters.\r\n\r\n> On a side note: Is Bloemsma
    the new fad?\r\n\r\nI wonder about that. I very much was liking Bloesma, thinking
    his typefaces were underused. And then it seems everyone else must have felt the
    same way, because, as you say, he seems to be the new fad."

    slight pendrawn feel.
