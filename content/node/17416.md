  body: Nearly anything. The most important factor is your style and audience. So,
    what's the project?

  body: "If you're going to combine it with another font, I'd suggest a serif font.
    Two different sans together usually looks weird.\r\n\r\nI combined Meta once with
    Filosofia and it looked good, but as Stefan says, it depends on the project."

  body: I whould advise the use of Officina Serif. Erik's principle is quite the same,
    and they match in several attributes.

  body: "We've just recently acquired a journal whose existing layout mixes Meta (headings,
    cover) with Times (zzzz... body) so \"Nearly Anything\" sounds about right.\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\nEver
    since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working."

  body: Meta is a sturdy typeface that can work with a lot of varying styles of fonts.
    I'll ditto Stephen's question -- audience and purpose?
