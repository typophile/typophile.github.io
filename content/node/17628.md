body: "Typophiles, I ask you for some advice.\r\n\r\nOver the past two years or so,
  I've been working on a new digitization of the [[Centaur]] types of [[Bruce Rogers]].
  I've publicly posted images of the 60pt caps (visible on my \"<a href=\"http://levien.com/type/myfonts/\">fonts
  in progress</a>\" page under \"Museum Caps\"), but have since drawn 60pt lowercase
  and a moderately complete 14pt optical scale.\r\n\r\nMy feeling was that [[Monotype
  Imaging]], the foundry with clear lineage from the [[Monotype]] that did the first
  wide release of this font, should get first dibs. However, I've just received a
  definite \"no\" from them, so I'm in a bit of a quandary about what to do with the
  outlines I've created so far.\r\n\r\nMy choices include:\r\n\r\n1. Give it up entirely.\r\n\r\n2.
  Finish what I have, which is an extremely faithful reproduction of the Monotype
  metal version, and release it with my own naming (I like \"Museum\") on, say, MyFonts.\r\n\r\n3.
  Adapt it so that it's still very clearly Centaur, but less slavish to the Monotype
  metal. There are plenty other sources to draw on, including the original handset
  Centaur, its predecessor Montaigne, and of course Jenson's original.\r\n\r\n4. Start
  over on my own Jenson revival, with a similar design brief: a calligraphic interpretation
  with the same letter architecture and proportions as the Jenson Eusebius. A danger
  here, though, is that if I \"clean up\" the outlines too much, I might end up with
  something very close to Adobe Jenson.\r\n\r\n5. Go after a different 20th Century
  metal Jenson revival entirely. I'm intrigued with Mardersteig's Zeno, but haven't
  been able to get my hands on a really high quality sample (there's a middling reproduction
  in [[Anatomy of a Typeface]]).\r\n\r\nLastly, is there any problem with posting
  a PDF of what I've done so far? I'm really trying to balance the ethical questions
  of rights and the like with my strong sense that making a really high quality version
  of Centaur available is the right thing to do."

    i might check in with [[Font Bureau]]. If you find a foundry that's interested,
    perhaps the can tell you what they would like and that would help you choose from
    your options listed above.

    since the end of the metal era? One can understand their not bothering with optical
    adjustment for photosetting, when it would have complicated the system and when
    there was always letterpress for serious work, but it beggars belief how much
    they've not only thrown away in digitisation but seem here to be actively suppressing.\r\n\r\nI
    think that what the world needs and hasn't got right now is a broad palette of
    text types of the excellence of Centaur, offering separate fonts for each point
    size rather than just Text and Display variants. The early twentieth century's
    work of recovery, in often inspired reinterpretations, in which Rogers took part
    and which Morison oversaw for Monotype, needs to be done again. \r\n\r\nHow does

    years ago investigating Jenson, staring for days at various copies of the Eusebius
    at the British Library and digging into Jenson's story for a project I was/am

    ask yourself is what you intend this to be used for. \r\n\r\nCentaur looks fabulous
    in large sizes, but even the metal looked anemic in small sizes, and if I remember
    correctly, the x height may be just too small for usual book text sizes. So if
    you want to make it usable at 9-11 pt, it is definitely a non-trivial exercise.
    If you can pull it off it would be great. And it would be a different animal either
    from the original or Monotype's versions. Because it is your hand and eye, it
    won't turn into Adobe Jenson, unless you copy it, which of course you shouldn't
    do. \r\n\r\nCentaur has a feel of its own, and I don't know if you can ever capture
    it well for smaller optical sizes. But if you could that would be a worthy goal.
    Whether it makes any sense for you to spend the time on it is another question.
    \ \r\n\r\nIf you only want a version that works better at large sizes that is
    an easier job that you have already started. The question is, who will use it,
    and do you want to produce it for them. "

  body: Rogers' Centaur was, of course, just a 14 point text and titling design. I
    don't know how much optical adjustment Monotype made in metal, but whatever their
    decisions were they could legitimately be made differently in your version, Raph,
    should you wish to resurrect Rogers' Centaur while providing for more sizes. On
    the other hand, I don't think getting Centaur to work at 9 point in extended text
    is all that crucial, since it needs so much less leading than, say, Adobe Caslon
    that one can reasonably expect it to be used at greater than normal point sizes.

    This is certainly true for the standard Centaur, but there was also a Bible Centaur,
    cut specifically for the Oxford Lectern Bible. It has a higher x-height, and is
    also nice and strong. I have a copy of \"An Account of the Making of the Oxford
    Lectern Bible\", put out by Monotype as a promotional item, and it's a nice sample
    of the 18pt Bible Centaur printed on fairly rough paper, as Rogers has stated
    is optimal for the font.\r\n\r\nGeorge asked: <cite>How does your Centaur compare
    to LTC Metropolitan?</cite>\r\n\r\nThere's not much real difference between LTC
    Metropolitan and Monotype Centaur. They seem to be digitized from the same source
    (pattern plates for the 12pt, but without any gain added, so the overall strength
    is somewhere intermediate between metal 14 and 60 pt sizes). The LTC has less
    \"touching-up\" of the original eccentricity of the font (the sharp edges on the
    bowl of the \"a\" is the most visible such modification by Monotype), but its
    outlines are also pretty sloppy. Neither version has anything approaching real
    optical scaling - that's one of the most important aspects of this project, and
    of course a major part of Adobe Jenson.\r\n\r\nI still haven't decided what to
    do, but have sketched out a handful of lowercase letters of my own, along the
    lines of (4) above.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cecco.png]\r\n\r\nThese
    are still fairly rough, but I'm encouraged. I took a closer look at Adobe Jenson,
    and I'm no longer particularly worried about ending up with a clone of it. There
    are clearly some major decisions I would make very differently.\r\n"

    Bembo, released for the Monotype machine the same year, Centaur was an exceptionally
    beautiful and eminently readable revival of Renaissance type.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    the producers of the digital version made a common mistake: the shapes are based
    on the most basic starting point of Bruce Rogers\u2019 designs. These designs
    were intended for metal type that would press into paper, the ink spreading as
    it absorbed into the fibre. The resulting printed shapes had a good deal more
    visual force than the original designs. The process was total: design anticipating
    application.\r\n\r\nThis version of Centaur suffers from the perfection of the
    process of digital design and offset printing: the original shape is printed coldly
    intact, and thus it\u2019s very difficult to set a well-made page in Centaur.\r\n\r\n"
