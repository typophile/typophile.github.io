body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am wondering about a problem with one of my fonts
  I am editing in fontlab: When opening a glyph in metrics window and clicking on
  it, usually there is a small arrow below the glyph which allows me to copy the metrics
  to its composites.\r\nBut now, this small arrow is only shown for some glyphs (for
  example c, d, e, h, ...), as for others they are not (like a, g, dotlessi, k, ...).
  I have checked if the composites i want to apply the metrics to are really composites
  of that glyps - they are, so I just don't know what I am doing wrong.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone encountered the same problem and found a solution?\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  help\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n\r\nAddition: This is only occuring with one special font.
  When trying with another, everything is fine."

    check that 'a' is the <em>first</em> component in 'adieresis'.\r\n\r\nEigi"
