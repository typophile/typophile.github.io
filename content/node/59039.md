  font??\r\n\r\nI am not trying to ruin anything or stealing any fonts, but i am working
  on a major global Agency and at our Korean office they have been so smart to buy
  a otherwise great font called YoonGothic..\r\n\r\nMy problem and the reason why
  i need to edit it is it simply don't contain \xAE (Registreded R)\r\nWhich is quiet
  a big problem since we are doing work on an strongly legal controlled client..\r\n\r\nI
  have change designed and changed font's with Typetool3 and Fontlab Studio before,
  but this font i am not able to open up and re-design...\r\n\r\nI know a lot of people
  might think that what i am doing is wrong but consider this, how can a professional
  font design company make a font with roughly 8700 characters not not design a \xAE...
  especially when thinking of the Korean office have bought 35 licenses at a pretty
  hefty price..\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance\r\nNicklas\r\n\r\n"

    Asia Font studio. Fontforge (a free/open-source font editor) might also be able
    to handle a font of that size.\r\n\r\nBut if you\u2019ve bought 35 licenses of
    what I imagine was a very expensive typeface I think you should call up the vendor
    and ask them to do it. "

    the missing character.

  body: "I second James's comment: If your agency has made a substantial investment
    in a professional font, then I think you should contact the original foundry and
    request that they add the \xAE for you. Like you say, probably should have been
    in there from the beginning. I think it's a reasonable request. \r\n\r\nIt certainly
    can't hurt to ask, and might be the most effective way to get this done.\r\n\r\n"

    based font company it's not as easy as it looks to get them aligned with our wishes,
    but we are trying that solution, but meanwhile it would be nice t see if there
    are any other possibly solutions...\r\n\r\nBut thanks for the reply"

  body: "I wonder if SING (Smart Independent Glyphlets) technology will help, depending
    on which applications you are using.\r\n\r\nI trust your Korean office will be
    able to handle any requests to Yoon Design. But it might help to tell them that
    supplying missing glyphs upon request of clients is part of the 'global standard'.
    Let me know in case you need help with translation.\r\n\r\nAre you pairing Yoon
    Gothic with another font for the Latin or are you just using the default Latin
    provided with it? In the case of the former, you would just use the \xAE in the
    Latin font. If the font will be used for bilingual text, not just the occasional
    Latin acronyms thrown in a mostly Korean text, then it will be worth considering
    using a Latin-specific font compatible with Yoon Gothic anyway.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way, what 'version' of Yoon Gothic are you using? The latest is the 500 range,
    and though I haven't used it, it's possible that they have added some character
    support. But admittedly, character support has not been Yoon Design's strong suit
    compared to rival Korean foundries (8700 characters means no Chinese character
    support and only the most commonly-used modern Korean characters)."
