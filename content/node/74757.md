  body: "According to the 2nd century author Lucian, ships were destroyed during the
    Siege of Syracuse using a technique created by Archimedes of using polished shields
    to focus light onto attacking ships to set them on fire. \r\n\r\n(The tv show
    Mythbusters tested this story using parabolic bronze mirrors, and concluded it
    was probably not true due to the difficulty of focusing enough light for a long
    enough time onto the sails of a moving ship. It would also have been a highly
    unreliable weapon since clouds would render it useless.)"
