body: "I was just recently asked to sketch out some ideas for an iPad version of a
  magazine. I\u2019m still trying to decide if HTML5 is the way to go. This all got
  me wondering how foundries go about licensing fonts for @font-face used in iPad/iPhone/iPod
  apps. What determines the pricing? A magazine app would typically be free, but with
  paid subscriptions and/or paid single issues. And what about free previews?\r\nI\u2019ve
  been experimenting with a website using SVG fonts, which currently seems to be the
  only supported format for the iPad. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot to be desired.
  I\u2019m not sure how much effect any hinting would have in my case, but the lack
  of kerning and next-to-nill support for OT features is far from impressive. "

  body: "This is all new and it seems like different foundries are all trying out
    different approaches. This has been my approach:\r\nTechnically, the specs I've
    seen for ipad app development recommend using .otf files. This isn't always the
    case, depends on the develop. Hinting-wise, it's a rotating screen with Apple
    rendering, so there's not much you can do anway. For OT features, I've had to
    build custom non-opentype, subset (to mac roman) versions. \r\nLicensing-wise,
    it depends on the method the developer is using. For otf method, I've been approaching
    it similar to how I would for font encapsulation for software or video games.
    To keep things simple and fair, I try not think too hard about how the is going
    to distribute/sell the app. Those numbers are almost always complete guesses and
    it's not worth my time to try to parse their business model (sku/month x price
    + views/month x ad_rate) / the imaginary value the use of the fonts add. Instead
    I go with a flat rate with a discount for licensing multiple styles/weights."

    no real correlation to existing models so it's kind of a wild-west area for licensing. "

  body: "I\u2019m not asking from a type designers perspective (at least not yet),
    so I\u2019m probably not the one to decide. I think the fact that the iPad/Pod/Phone
    is a closed system should have something to say. The fonts are not available in
    the same way they would be if they were embedded inside an application on a regular
    computer, although I guess that never stopped pirates. \r\n\r\n@Jackson:\r\nI
    take it OT fonts are only used in native apps? Or does Safari support OT? You
    can design applications as a website in HTML5/CSS/JS packed inside a custom shell
    that is really no more than a webkit browser."

  body: 'I was talking specifically about developing native apps. For me, it all depends
    on how they are using the fonts. If it''s a raw font or a web format,  bundled
    into the app (in the library or package contents), and being redistributed (as
    opposed to downloaded and cached) I consider it encapsulating. '

  body: "There are various ways to build the apps. I can't speak for native Objective-C
    apps, but (at least in theory) one could use @font-face when writing an app via
    HTML/CSS/JS that then gets compiled via xcode.\r\n\r\nOne can also build a web
    app based on HTML5 browser caching where you can tell the iOS (or, more precisely,
    I suppose, mobile Safari) what elements should be cached for local use on the
    device. I'm not sure if that can include font files or not. \r\n\r\nSome info

  body: I got in touch with the foundry in question for my project, but the price
    exceed the planned retail price ($5) by far. Even if we reduce the number of fonts
    to an absolute minimum (three) native embedding appears to be totally unfeasible.
