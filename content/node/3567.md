    my only -limited- way of seeing what a Hebrew font is &#34;doing&#34; is to compare
    its structures to those of other fonts that I&#39;ve been analyzing lately. <BR>

    a great deal, like &#34;squaring out&#34; the top left corners of the roundest
    letters, and also making the commas and parentheses larger, so readers would be
    able to differenciate them from similar symbols better. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28518.gif"

    space.  <BR>Yes, it was very needed. <BR> <BR>- Some of the sidebearings &#40;like
    the Dalet&#39;s left&#41; should be zero.  <BR>I don&#39;t agree. The terribly
    small size of the letters makes spacing crucial. Zeroing a sidebearing on any
    of the letters &#40;I&#39;ve tried numerous tracking combinations&#41; yields
    very odd implications. Kerning would be super if I could get it to work... Haven&#39;t
    mastered that field technically, I&#39;m afraid. <BR> <BR>- I like your vertical
    proportions, I just wonder if it wouldn&#39;t be better to give the Lamed a 2-pixel

    Hebrew we call them &#34;poles&#34;&#41; too short, it just isn&#39;t natural.
    Look at this caricature from an old Hebrew calligraphy/typography teaching book:
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28580.gif" alt="Cutting
    off Lamed&#39;s pole"> <BR> <BR>- Widths: I think it&#39;s better too wide than
    too narrow, I just wonder if width variance can&#39;t be used to diverge the confusable
    letters even more, like in the Bet versus Kaf. <BR>True, but that is not my main
    concern about these wider letters. I&#39;m more troubled by the notion it makes
    the eye linger on them, trying to decode these odd shapes&#39; meanings. I&#39;d
    hate having to part with this incredible addition to my font. <BR> <BR>- Alef:
    what about making the top-right arm shorter &#40;coming out from higher up in
    the diagonal&#41;? That would reduce the distracting symmetry.  <BR>I&#39;ve made
    it assymetrical now, correspondant with the Tzadi, which I believe is a letter
    meant to be similar to the Alef. <BR> <BR>- I really like the bravery of the Gimel.  <BR>Thank
    you! It stayed that way from the 2000 version. <BR> <BR>- The wobble in the Zayin
    is valuable, but it&#39;s too jittery in small bitmaps - I&#39;d try not bringing
    the down stroke back to the right after the left shift. So basically a flipped
    Vav &#40;shorter by a pixel&#41; with a flat top added.  <BR>Shifted the upper
    pixel back. I don&#39;t like the idea of Zayin being too narrow, I want more-or-less
    similar widths for the letters, because I believe it improves readability. <BR>
    <BR>- I wonder if the Yod needs to be stronger.  <BR>I&#39;ve widened the Yod,
    Vav and Nun-Sofit. <BR> <BR>- What about giving the &#40;non-final&#41; Mem an
    ascending pixel? <BR>That wouldn&#39;t be very wise, an ascending pixel would
    make it seem bigger than the other letters. I&#39;ve taken off a pixel from the
    bottom, to emphasize its Mem-ity :&#62; <BR> <BR>- What can you do to make the
    Nun less like the Kaf?  <BR>I&#39;ve added a pixel on the bottom right edge. <BR>
    <BR>- What about giving the Samekh an extra leftward pixel on top? <BR>Nah, I
    don&#39;t want the letters to be too square. <BR> <BR>- Smart divergence between
    the Qof and the He.  <BR>Thanks! This has also been in the 2000 version. <BR>
    <BR>- The final-Mem is too square. Hey, it is a square! What about curling in
    the left stem at the very top? <BR>Oops! Got me there. Here, it&#39;s fixed now.

    maybe you&#39;re right about the zero sidebearings considering kerning is not
    always available, but why are you having trouble with kerning? <BR> <BR>&#62;
    I&#39;m more troubled by the notion it makes the <BR>&#62; eye linger on them,
    trying to decode these <BR>&#62; odd shapes&#39; meanings. <BR> <BR>Actually,
    you&#39;re right: at this size legibility is more important than readability.
    &#40;See below.&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, are they really &#34;odd&#34;? <BR>Are they
    odd because of a conscious attempt by you or because of the lo-res? <BR> <BR>&#62;
    I want more-or-less similar widths for the letters, because I believe it improves
    readability.  <BR> <BR>Actually, width divergence is a big factor is readability
    &#40;as long as no glyph is <i>too</i> narrow&#41;. BUT, legibility &#40;different
    than readability&#41; does benefit from &#34;raw&#34; size &#40;= width&#41;,
    so I think a wide Zayin is smart, especially in the context of the Vav. BTW, I
    think the old Vev &#40;and the old final-Nun&#41; were better &#40;more divergent
    from similars&#41;. <BR> <BR>You know what? The confusing network in Hebrew is
    very strong and very pervasive. <BR>I need to make a diagram, like the one I&#39;ve
    done for Latin: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&amp;s.gif"
    target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&amp;s.gif</a> <BR> <BR>What
    would be really nice though is some linguistic data - like at least letter frequencies,
    or in this case ideally a &#40;long&#41; list of the most frequent Hebrew words.
    That would help seeing which letters are most confusable in actual text, not just
    in a structural vacuum. I think John has some info like this, no? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Meir, this is a really nice piece of work.  <BR> <BR>Im not so sure i understand
    why you made the letters with the dagesh wider then the ones without it. Is there
    a rational to it? <BR>in a thinner pei with dagesh you can make the pei not enter
    the the space inside. that way the dagesh wont connect to the pei&#39;s body.
    <BR> <BR>I really like the alef. its extremly nice. the whole font has a good
    feeling to it, like the old concept font. <BR> <BR>Maybe the old zayin was better.
    consider its aesthetic value. <BR> <BR>I feel we stumble into the same problems
    in hebrew screen fonts. for example, the mem looks very much like the het. if
    you drop that pixel at the bottom of the mem you&#39;ll be left with a het. the
    subtle differance is also present in taf and het, tet and samech, and by some
    extension of the phenomena its also present in- bet and kaf &amp; resh and dalet.
    <BR>do you find this one-pixel diffrence as disturbing as i do? &#42;sigh&#42;
    i think its a major problem. <BR>i tryed solving it by making all letters wider
    and more &#39;detailed&#39;. i sort of droped the idea of having a mem without
    some sort of oketz, or a nice circle-shaped samech, etc&#39;. well, you saw Kyoto.
    its not so much a solution to this legibility problem as an escape from it. <BR>

  body: Itay, the rationale behind the wide letters is that the overall shape of the
    letter is preserved, while positioning the dagesh mark in the exact middle of
    the letter&#39;s inner space. <BR>Understand I&#39;m having moral difficulties
    altering the Pei. :&#62; It simply isn&#39;t what I&#39;m trying to acheive in
    this font. <BR> <BR>Answering Hrant&#39;s unanswered &#34;oddity&#34; question,
    the shapes of the wide letters are indeed odd, but only because modern Hebrew
    readers aren&#39;t used to wide letters, that are a norm in prayer books and such.
    <BR> <BR>Being a Sevenet compliant, I&#39;m trying to make it more or less wide
    enough and simple enough to be associated with the simple latin letters of that
    face. <BR> <BR>The one-pixel difference is biasing, but in this occurance is also
    manageable. The base matrix for this font is 5x5 pixels, meaning 25 pixels give
    an overhaul 100% for a single, average letter. Altering one pixel would affect
    4% of the entire composition - that is a lot! And when we&#39;re talking about
    its perimeter, that&#39;s almost 6%, and when we&#39;re talking about a single
    edge, well, now we&#39;re at 20%! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28650.gif"
    alt="The font matrix"> <BR> <BR>Oh, and also referring Hrant&#39;s question about
    making it bolder - I wouldn&#39;t dare making this specific font bolder, but when
    it comes to making heavy-weight Hebrew fonts, I either strengthen its horizontal
    strokes, or make both horizontal and vertical strokes bolder. I avoid strengthening
    only the vertical lines because it gives Hebrew letters a very fragile look.

    basically an &#34;alternative&#34; alphabet &#40;although in a more typographic
    rendering&#41;... Divergence is good for you, and the conventional Hebrew &#34;print&#34;
    script is too modular. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Backslanting Hebrew type is quite common lately in Hebrew fonts, perhaps it&#39;s
    so because of the inverse directionality of the language. In any case, slanted/oblique/italic
    Hebrew fonts are pretty rare in general because there is no true Hebrew &#34;italic&#34;.
    In an early <a href="http://www.shunammite.com/type.html">David Hebrew</a> release
    &#40;by the late designer Ismar David&#41;, an &#34;Italic&#34; style has been
    suggested, and as you can see it slants to the left, maybe in order to be more
    compatible with Latin texts &#40;in the link you can also see its beautiful and
    unreleased &#34;Sans&#34; style I&#39;m currently studying&#41;. <BR> <BR>It is
    well known that Hebrew letters lack divergence and therefore Hebrew text suffers
    great readability issues. There have been some <a href="http://www.fontbit.co.il/Stigma.html">quite
    bizzare experimentations</a> lately but I still haven&#39;t seen a better adaptation
    of the &#34;cursive&#34; style than the example I showed in my previous post.

    body: "There seems to be much debate about the direction of italic in Hebrew.
      I had a discussion a few years back with Tzvika Rosenberg on the subject.\r\n\r\nDavid
      seems to be the only classic font with a true italic and in this case the italic
      was forward. However, it is my opinion that a Hebrew italic should be backwards
      in the same direction as its Latin counterpart for the simple reason that Hebrew
      cursive script (handwriting) is always written in that direction. If italic
      fonts are supposed to mimic handwriting, then it only makes sense that this
      should be the direction of the font.\r\n\r\nTzvika likes to call italics that
      are in the direction of English fonts, \"italic\" and italics that are forward
      moving (like in David Italic aka MF Ramot in the Masterfont library) oblique.
      I personally think that this is an incorrect definition, but the debate will
      no doubt continue.\r\n\r\nFontbit has just released a new text font with real
      italics called ktifa, which has italics in both directions in order to keep
      both camps happy I guess!"

    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I think you should make a &#34;cursive&#34; Hebrew book face.
    I put that in quotes because I don&#39;t think it should look handwritten, certainly
    not obviously so. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    supposed to differentiate snippets of text in a body of [nominally] upright text.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I like butterflies, but with that one the urge to swat is palpable.  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
