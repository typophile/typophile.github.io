  think it matches with centro, so i need some expert help please.\r\nI am a novice.
  \ I like the headline font on this website actually...\r\n\r\nI guess i am thinking
  about the wired mag too although i don't want to use their fonts.  Also; i can't
  afford the centro slab e.t.c  as it is too expensive.\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\nMiss
