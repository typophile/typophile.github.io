  body: Thanks for the response. That's really close, but the way the "e" finishes
    in Chalet Paris 1960 is slightly different (it's on an angle in my image).

  body: I believe antofa is right, and it looks to me like the e terminates horizontally
    in your image as it does in chalet (unless you're referring to something else
    I'm missing)
