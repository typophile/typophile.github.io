body: "My apologies for the zaney subject line, but now that I've got your attention...\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a project that requires an energetic, hand drawn, script style typeface.
  I actually already found the perfect solution, it's called Mustang (see below).
  Unfortunately the client feels that it's \"too hard to read\". I'm going to try
  my best to persuade them otherwise, but will definitely need some alternates in
  my back pocket. \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/robarnow/mustang/\r\n\r\nMy
  search for something with similar qualities hasn't yielded anything good. Mostly
  what I'm finding are retro 50's era sign lettering (seems to be in vogue at the
  mo') or dodgy hand-writing fonts that lack the emotion, flare and spontaneity of
  the mighty Mustang.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions, please help a brother
  out...  it'd be much appreciated! \r\n\r\np.s. I'd love to do custom lettering,
  but time & budget is probably not going to allow for it this time around. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "First, without knowing what your project involves, I think I might be inclined
    to agree with your client. Mustang has a lot of life to it, but it is not going
    to be very easy to read unless it is just a few large-type words.\r\n\r\n'Energetic,
    hand-drawn script style' candidates: ITC Arid, Ru'Ach, Banshee and Tiger Rag.
    These are all 90's era fonts found at MyFonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, I will take a look. \r\n\r\nI agree, it's not the most legible font.
    I think it works well if used sparingly though, ie. just for short headlines. "
