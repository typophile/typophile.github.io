body: "Hi guys, a client has reported a problem viewing a PDF in Acrobat 7 and 5 which
  was generated from InDesign CS4 (producer: Adobe PDF Library 9.0, version:1.4)and
  has an OTF font embedded as a subset. It views perfectly in Acrobat 9 and Apple
  Preview but in earlier versions of Acrobat the text displays as a series of checked
  rectangular boxes.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if this is a CS4 issue? The font embeds/views
  fine in earlier Acrobat versions when I test from CS2. I've left a note on the Acrobat
  forum but thought I'd check if any typophilers have seen anything like this.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJoe

  body: You might check how it was exported. It might just be a compatibility issue.
    I recently sent a client a PDF that was only viewable in the latest reader.

  body: My PDF was actually generated from Keynote 08. It uses the latest export selection,
    I'm guessing, and that is why my clients couldn't open it with their old reader.
    I had to open the PDF in Acrobat and re-save it to an older setting.
