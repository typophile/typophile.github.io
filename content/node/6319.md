  to post it here when I&#39;m done. But before I begin,what order are the letters
  designed. do I start with the letter &#39;a&#39; or the letter &#39;o&#39;? what
  letter have shapes in common? <BR> <BR>IM

  body: Notes on type design <BR>The skills of designing letters can be learned, <BR>just
    like other skills. The techniques of fitting them <BR>together are no secret.
    The tools are better than they <BR>used to be. Alchemy probably helps, but managing
    without <BR>that is the purpose of orderly work. You can digitize <BR>almost any
    shape you imagine. <BR><a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm"

  body: '&#34;Zapf had a very strong calligraphy background. When he lectured to my
    sophomore year typography class, he would write quite beautiful Roman letters
    on a blackboard using the side of a piece of chalk held at an angle like a flat-pen.

  body: You can start with whatever glyph you want, Ivan. Everyone has a different
    system. I&#39;ve been starting with the lowercase I for awhile, but that probably
    isn&#39;t the best. Some start with h, n, and o

  body: Once you actually start making font outlines, it is a good idea to start with
    letters that define basic proportions and spacing, e.g. the lowercase n and o.
    But when working out initial design ideas, it is best to start with the letters
    that will give the design most of its character. This will vary depending on the
    design, but often it will be the lowercase a, e, and g.

  body: Thanx so much for the insight guys. <BR> <BR>Alessandro, that is a great website
    for learning type! I printed all the pages. Thanx <BR> <BR>I have another question.
    what determines the width of a letter. For example, if I begin with the letter
    &#39;o&#39; how do I know how wide it has to be. Is it personal taste? Or is it
    a wide as the letter &#39;h&#39;? how is consistency in letter width acheived?

    will initiate you in the mysteries of glyph width and spacing, but nobody understands
    it fully.

  body: 'Ivan, there can be no strict rules, but good guidelines there can. <BR> <BR>In
    terms of character sequence, it&#39;s true that personal preference is a huge
    factor, but it also seems that text fonts benefit from starting with the &#34;bland&#34;
    characters &#40;like &#34;n&#34;&#41; while display fonts benefit from starting
    with the more &#34;flavorful&#34; characters &#40;like the &#34;a&#34;&#41;. Also,
    it might be smart to favor the more frequent letters &#40;like &#34;e&#34;&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>And in terms of width, I think these things are useful to consider: <BR>1&#41;
    Generally, wide fonts seem more friendly and warm but also provincial, while narrow
    fonts appear more strict, cold and elegant. <BR>2&#41; Narrow fonts fit more text
    in the visual span of the eyes, helping reading. <BR>3&#41; Fonts that are too
    narrow however converge the widths of boumas too much, slowing reading. <BR>4&#41;
    For setting single lines &#40;like headlines, or phone book listings&#41;, or
    where you&#39;d like to reduce hyphens &#40;especially in narrow columns&#41;
    narrow fonts have an obvious advantage. <BR>5&#41; However, narrowness isn&#39;t
    necessarily more economical in running setting, because you can just as well save
    space &#40;in the vertical instead of the horizontal dimension&#41; by using a
    wider font at a smaller point size &#40;maintaining apparent size&#41; - it depends
    on a few things, including the proportion of paragraph breaks you have in the
    text. <BR>6&#41; At smaller point sizes &#40;like below 9&#41;, width &#40;and
    looseness&#41; help readability. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I&#39;d like to say that lc &#39;a&#39; is the ideal starting point for a
    face &#40;in my opinion--and that&#39;s all it is--this letter sets a lot of the
    character of a typeface&#41;.  However, for reasons reasonably touched on by Hrant,
    it doesn&#39;t work for all kinds of faces. <BR> <BR>For a face that emphasizes
    the &#34;look&#34;, lc &#39;a&#39; seems right on.  But where text is concerned,
    and more rules mean a lot more in terms of functionality, &#39;a&#39; seems too
    much a loner.
