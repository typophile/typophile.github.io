  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm developing an article template for companion articles for my blog.  The blog will include a larger article about once per month.  The blog is a companion to a book I'm hopefully release this year.  I'm trying for a simple and clean look.  It needs to be professional and appeal to my target audience of engineers.  The current design is inspired by the article format of the Harvard Business Review.  

Any overall feedback would be appreciated.  I'm also wondering if it is too plain or if I need to add a logo somewhere.  The other open question is do I need a running head or foot for an article this short?  Should I at least include page numbers?

Thank you very much for the help.

Cheers,
Zack

One thing I would suggest is making more contrast between your headers and the body copy on pages 2 and 3. If you look at where you have a longer subhead, to me it blends in with the body copy. "About the Author" is pretty good, but I'd make even more contrast. A little bigger, maybe all caps or space beneath the subhead. Just play with it a bit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My main response, which others will probably say also, is that it would help to see the content of the articles before deciding on a suitable design. You can point out some things with Lorem Ipsum text but the majority of the design decisions have to be made in the context of the real text being set.

Apart from that, my 2 cents is:

Both the headings would stand out better if you put in a blank line before the paragraph. Since you are using blank lines between paragraphs, it looks especially unbalanced having the headers glued to the top of them.

The rest of it seems to work pretty well. It's certainly a clean look, but if you want it to be distinctive you might want to add more stylistic features.

I don't think the pull quote works going across two columns like that and the brown is too dark to be a contrast to the black. I'd either stick with black or use a lighter brown or a grey. Also, some structure around the pull quote might help it. The way I usually do them is across a single column with a 5pt stroke top and bottom with the text centred and italicised.

Page numbers would probably be a good idea.</div>
