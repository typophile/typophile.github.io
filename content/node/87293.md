  body: "I don't know if a single /I is enough to reveal the construction of other
    letters, but let's try..\r\n\r\nIf you think of it as an outline font, you can
    take a look to:\r\n<strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-korinna/bold-outline/|ITC
    Korinna Outline Bold]]</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you consider only the (white) interior
    of /I, it may be more similar to e.g.:\r\n<strong>Veracruz Regular</strong> -
    (C) 1993 B & P Graphics, Ltd.\r\n<strong>Leroy Becker</strong> - Copyright SoftMaker
    Software GmbH and its licensors 1991-1999\r\n<strong>Intuition SSK Regular</strong>\r\n"
