  body: Happy birthday, Hrant! <BR> <BR>But this dark chocolate madness &#42;must&#42;
    be stopped!The entire American corporate culture is oriented to produce milk chocolate.
    If the US lets people eat whatever kind of chocolate they like, there&#39;ll be
    anarchy! Not to mention lower corporate profits. <BR> <BR>Time to plant some rumors
    about WMDs at Bernard Callebaut&#39;s shop.... <BR> <BR>T

    a lot quieter. =&#41; <BR> <BR>When you sleep tonight may you dream of pluralistic

    is free and never the Hersheys variety. <BR> <BR>Have a good one.
