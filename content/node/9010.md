  constructive criticism you can offer to improve the process and the look of it.
  This is all the letter I have finished so far...<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64427.gif"

  body: Chris, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this top-heavy font in use. <BR>
    <BR>The only character that really bothers me is the &#39;B&#39;. The top bowl
    is too top-heavy for my taste. It&#39;s the width more than the height. I&#39;d
    optically adjust it so it&#39;s a bit more narrow. Just enough to correct the
    illusion that it&#39;s wider than the bottom.

  body: I would make the same comment as Crugen, about B, of P. The top bowl is too
    heavy. I also, lookin forward to seeing this typeface in use.  Do you also plan
    to draw the lowercases?

  body: "I really like your new font. I think it would really work in some kind of
    new sci-fi print-base! I am wondering if the A need a bit of squidge on the top
    as it seems a bit more pointy than the other letters? However i think it is beautiful.
    It would work.\r\n \r\nI could say that Nick may be right about the A, perhaps
    being a lil bit too wide as it stands out a little from the other letters. But
    that may be your aim. It is pretty unique. \r\n\r\nThe B is lovely. I think that
    if the bar of the A and the bottom of the P\u2019s bowl were to come to the same
    level as the other letters, you may have created a perfect font. Keep up the good
    work!\r\n\r\nIt is beautiful.\r\n\r\n"
