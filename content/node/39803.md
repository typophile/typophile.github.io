  movements. Im not looking for thought relating to graphic design in particular but
  design theory and though that relates to all forms of design. I dont know if this
  kind of book even exists out there but Im hoping it does.\r\n\r\nI have a pretty
  basic understanding of design movements like modernism and functionalism for instance
  but I want to learn how these ways of thinking and designing are related and how
  they have evolved and what designers were associated. A book with images that show
  examples would be a bonus also. Some critical essays and good all around coverage
  of the timeline would be nice also.\r\n\r\nSo does anyone know of such a book....

    will need something more current for post-modernism, etc."
