  a client. I'm having trouble finding typefaces.\r\nI'm currently 'stuck' on FF Meta,
  and considered FF Unit, Info and Fago. The problem is in my opinion Meta is a bit
  generic and overused, so I want to go with fago, but I see some problems in kerning
  and reading longer texts. On the other hand if Meta works, I should be happy ( and
  shouldn't care about how I - as a designer -look at the face...)?!\r\n\r\nI like
  to know anyone's experience and opinion about Fago and could give some alternatives.\r\n\r\n-
  - The reason for the choice of Meta/Fago is that their letterforms follow the forms
  of the logo (letterforms), without 'biting' it.\r\nI basically need the squarisch
  roundishness combined with a hint of calligrafic stroke... -- \r\n \r\nThank you!\r\nMarco"

    to work with, loads of cuts, looked okay in body-copy. On the negative side it's
    so corporate it hinders your breathing.\r\n\r\nMeta is played out."

    sorry. I hear they're quite popular for this sort of thing!
