  a bit of a font dilettante, so please bear with me. My question has to do with the
  Gotham family: although I don&#39;t actually have the font, I&#39;ve been seeing
  it everywhere and I love it. I understand it&#39;s a polished distillation of all
  the postwar typography &#40;signage etc.&#41; that&#39;s still visible all over
  New York. Well, what I&#39;m looking for is a similarly polished distillation of
  something else entirely: the postwar typography that can still be seen here and
  there in cities like Prague and Budapest. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not after some sort of
  nearly-illegible constructivist Soviet-looking face; rather, what I want to find
  is a slick-looking cousin of Gotham that echoes the slightly more daring &#40;and
  sloppy&#41; geometry of letterforms that appeared behind the Iron Curtain. <BR>
  <BR>Here are some inspirational samples: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.greinke.com/photos/1997_07_29%20to%201997_08_29%20Prague/QuickTake%20134/AFRICKA%20SIGN.JPG"

  <BR> <BR>I especially like the last two. <BR> <BR>So: does anything evocative of
  that exist? Bueller? Bueller?'
