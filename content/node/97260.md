  my own. I'd like to stay as close to the old font as possible for the buttons, since
  most are already made, and there are a couple others not show, that are also already
  done. Can someone ID the font that's used on the navigation buttons for me?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.redpointclimbing.com]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!"
