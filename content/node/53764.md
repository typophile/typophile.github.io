body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI'm creating a business card for a client and we've decided to
  go with one colour letterpress, one sided. I think some 6 point frutiger light or
  perhaps for a more quirky approach, archer light small caps 5 or 6 will do nicely.\r\n\r\nI
  need advice though. I realise neither of these fonts were designed for letterpress,
  does anyone know how they might react or things to watch out for? Is it worth limiting
  myself to typefaces designed specifically for letterpress? I'm guessing i need to
  allow some extra (maybe around +5) letterspacing to allow for the bite? Any advice
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nDave"

    don't have to use only letterpress fonts...that would take a lot of the fun out
    of the whole modern/letterpress thing.\r\n\r\nHowever when I get something letterpressed
    or silkscreened I always ask my printer because these technologies are quirky
    and some printers respond to that better than others...some embrace experimentation
    and others fear it.\r\n\r\nThis guy seems to really know his stuff:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.crankypressman.com/crankyideas.html\r\n\r\npost
    after so we can see...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Does anyone else think that there needs to be a new term to describe this
    kind of impression? Because it isn\u2019t letterpress. Letterpress is not defined
    by a metal plate being used to create a relatively deep impression in specialty
    paper, and I don\u2019t like letting the printing trade appropriate the term this
    way."

  body: "While I'm not an expert, I have worked in a letterpress shop. AFAIK, there's
    nothing specific to design for when designing a font for letterpress anymore than
    designing a font for any ink-based printing system.\r\n\r\nAs James mentions,
    modern letterpress isn't really the same as the traditional craft. \r\n\r\nI do
    think we need a new term...perhaps lettersmooshed? Or pressmashed? Or more seriously,
    perhaps we should just call it 'Embossing with ink'\r\n\r\nI admit, I like it.
    Nothing funner than smashing ink into beer-coaster-weight paper. But yea, it's
    not printing in the traditional sense."

    It was all done by hand in Nairn by Piccolo Press.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.piccolopress.co.uk/\r\n\r\nI'll
    readily admit however that I'm no printer and could easily be mistaken, and everyday
    is a school day after all."

  body: "> it isn\u2019t letterpress.\r\n\r\n?\r\nJust because what? The letters aren't
    on individual little bars?\r\nThe letters are plastic instead of metal? Dude,
    it's letterpress.\r\nGood photopolymer letterpress doesn't have to be smooshed,
    or\r\nover-impressed, or anything - and \"traditional\" letterpress can\r\nbe
    those things. Although I'm no expert, I've done both, and I\r\nprinted my own
    cards using photopolymer letterpress:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/35023\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
