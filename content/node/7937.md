body: Hello all, i was wondering if anyone knew of a talent representative agency
  in florida...much like buzzco in chicago &#40; <a href="http://www.buzzco.com" target="_blank">www.buzzco.com</a>
  &#41; i&#39;m looking around down there for a possible move and was wondering if
  anyone had any good tips for searching for jobs before a move down there. i had
  great luck with buzzco up here in chicago and i&#39;m hoping there&#39;s something
  like it down there or maybe even a national talent rep agency that would help all
  over the country...anyone know some good ones? i&#39;m lost on a cloud with this...thanks
