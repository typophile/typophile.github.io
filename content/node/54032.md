body: "Hi All\r\n\r\nI am hoping that some of you have some experience and advice
  for me. I'm looking for a printer for my Mac and after reading reviews and trying
  to make comparisons, I'm going a bit cross-eyed. \r\n\r\nI need to be able to print
  on different kinds of paper, from vellum to card stock and not necessarily the printer
  brand of paper. I'm designing wedding invitations and baby announcements, so I do
  need something that will be decent at printing photos but especially good at graphics
  and text. All for under $400 CDN. Is it possible? \r\n\r\nThanks for all you help!\r\n\r\nNatalie"

    you usually want an old, used Laser printer. Something you don't mind trashing.\r\n\r\nWhich
    would be a different printer than the one you use for color photos and such. For
    that, you'd likely want a higher-end tank-fed Epson.\r\n\r\nIf you need something
    that does both, I think you might need to go the solid-ink route and try one of
    the wax printers. "
