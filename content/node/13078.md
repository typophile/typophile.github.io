body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a somewhat complex project, because it
  involves a large variety of alphabets with which I have no previous experience.
  The gist of the project involves the typesetting the phrase \"I Love You\" in the
  following languages:\r\n\r\nAfrikaans, Arabic, Basque, Bengali, Cantonese, Cherokee,
  Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
  Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Klingon, Korean,
  Latin, Malay, Mandarin, Mongolian, Morse Code, Norwegian, Persian, Pig Latin, Polish,
  Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Sign Language, Sioux, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish,
  Tagalog, Thai, Tibetan, Turkish, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Zulu.\r\n\r\nI'm facing
  a few problems:\r\n\r\n1) For the latin face, I need a condensed sans serif. The
  studio I am working for is currently using Arial ( I didn't choose it), because
  the unicode version supported a ton of extra alphabets. I can't let that slide.
  At worst, I'd like it to at least be Helvetica, but if there are any other faces
  that also have Cyrillic, Greek and/or other alphabets, I'd like some options. Again,
  it needs to be condensed sans-serif.\r\n\r\n2) For the non-latin alphabets, how
  do I go about choosing typefaces that will go well with the latin? I don't have
  experience working with anything other than the latin alphabet, so I am not familiar
  with faces from other alphabets.\r\n\r\nHopefully the collective wisdom of the typophile
  community can help me. I know a lot of you out there work with non-latin alphabets!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\neric"

    and Greek. I think it will probably support Vietnamese, but I could be wrong.
    For some of the Native American languages, you may be in trouble. I'm not aware
    of many sans serif faces (period) that support them. I'm sure John Hudson will
    know better than me. The squared-off ideographic typefaces (what Japanese call
    \"kaku\" typefaces) will match reasonably well with Myriad -- Hiragino Kaku, for
    example.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, most Klingon fonts suck horribly. I'm pretty sure
    Klingon has a Unicode plane (ah, no, but it does have a private use area), but
    I don't know of any professional designers who are depraved enough to include
    it in their designs. In general, you probably just want to make sure the general
    weight and proportions match, but good luck doing that with things like Tibetan.\r\n\r\nAnd
    to forestall Hrant, you probably ought to tack Armenian onto your list."

    would work better\r\nthan a narrow 6-point (economy being the same).\r\n\r\nArmenian
    is a separate branch of the IndoEuropean family; for a long time people thought
    it was a dialect of Farsi (since we <strong>have</strong> borrowed a lot of words
    from there) but Armenian's linguistic singularity has been established for long
    time now. As for our script, we use a \"custom\" alphabet (which some claim was
    derived from the Greek) designed by a priest in 401 AD.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      with Windows. I would not recommend Arial Unicode MS in setting the language.
      Also try the following sites for some other Unicode fonts:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nDavid
      McCreedy's Gallery of Unicode Fonts www.travelphrases.info/fonts.html would
      allow you to view some of Unicode fonts that are available. It might confuse
      you more as some of those fonts enlisted could be pretty ugly for the eyes of
      native typographers, but still very useful and helpful.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nAlan Wood's
      Unicode Resources www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html is a very good compendium
      page for Unicode fonts. However, there is no sampling.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>Helps
      me understand how the general population views typefaces.</cite>\r\n\r\nIsn't
      it wonderful... It would be also very interesting if you could list all those
      names of typefaces that you carefully choose for all those different languages
      as an end note...\r\n\r\nHave fun."

    I really only need a face that supports Latin, Cyrillic and Greek since this makes
