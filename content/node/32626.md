body: "I've created a small font with 8 logos used by a client, with only the 1-8
  slots filled (the rest of the font is empty), and generated it as a PS flavoured
  OT font.\r\n\r\nIt loads and works fine in all Adobe applications & Quark (PC &
  Mac), and it loads up fine in MSWord for PC, but it's not showing up at all in Word
  for Mac.\r\n\r\nIn the font menu list (where font names are displayed using the
  font itself), my font shows up on PC as a blank listing in the correct alphabetical
  slot (a blank listing because the font itself has no letters) and it works just
  fine, but on the Mac it doesn't show up at all.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: I'm giving that a shot now, but I'm curious what impact this would have (theoretically)?
    Is it necessary to have a full (basic) character set for a font to work across
    the board?

  body: I don't think so Paul; I've let FL create the names for me and this is only
    a single font (no bold, no italic, just the one style/weight), so there's no other
    style or weight to conflict with.

  body: "I've just done some testing and it appears FontBook is my problem. If I install
    the font on the Mac manually (by dumping it into the Fonts folder) it works just
    fine in Adobe & Macromedia apps and Word on the Mac, but if I install the font
    using FontBook it shows up in Adobe stuff, but not in Macro FW/FH and not in Word
    2004; that is, the font doesn't show up in the font menu list at all in those
    apps (all is fine in Adobe CS2 apps).\r\n\r\nAnyone run into similar bugs with
    FontBook? Solutions?"

    fonts.
