  text at the beginning of the most recent Star Wars films? It happens in part because
  the text is not allowed to be ragged right.... \r\n\r\nProbably all the others too
  - but this one was especially obvious to me.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know if it's been discussed, but I do know the word spacing was pretty
    bad on the 1st film (episode #4). I didn't notice it at the time (I was too young,
    and the effect was so new, my only feeling was \"WOW\"), but recently I re-watched
    the original, and I noticed the bad spacing.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that Harrison
    Ford was extremely young, and that the acting could have been better in spots.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems impossible that that came out 25+ years ago."

    does them), but he's like a saint, because he co-invented PhotoShop. And where
    would the world be without PhotoShop?

  body: Actually, the odd thing to me was the abscence of anybody reading anything
    ever. That was probably the result of a non-stop action, but I did like the original
    star wars for it's 3d games (chess in 3d), combat computers and GUIs. The last
    star wars is textless - i think. Apart from the opening of course...

  body: ">The last star wars is textless \r\n\r\nYeah, all those advanced civilizations
    without street advertising.\r\nDe-texting must have caught on.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's
    like in The Diamond Age, where you get the ads beamed straight into your visual
    cortex. If you're rich, you can see the world without them.\r\n\r\nAs a sports
    fan, I really enjoyed Wimbledon for the lack of commercial images on the playing
    surface and surrounds. Even the tennis players' clothing is de-texted. \r\n\r\nSorry,
    wandering off topic again."

  body: "I find I can't stop noticing & thinking about text/fonts anymore, especially
    at films. Like Erik Spiekermann said : paraphrasing : Typophilia is a terrible
    disease.\r\n\r\nNick, text on de-texting! :-) \r\n\r\nActually it is relaxing
    for me to be without texts, for the reason above. Have been somewhere where there
    is lots of text which you can't read? I find that also relaxing...\r\n\r\nI guess
    I was thinking of the most recent star wars film as a kind of vision of the future
    like the film 2001 was meant to be* and the abscence of writting seemed to me
    somehow not like wimbeldon as you describe it, but as kind of purposely bland,
    almost neutered vision - because of the abscence of incidental text - as opposed
    to simply advertising.\r\n\r\n*silly already i know. Really it's just a marketing
    vehicle after all.\r\n\r\nThis is the opposite of The Lord of the Rings, where
    text is central. It's on the ring. Or Blade Runner where incidental text is everywhere
    to create atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI think what I am getting at is that there was a
    missed opportunity to make this Star Wars more compelling. But then with dialog
    like that - it is not too surprising..."

  body: "Knowing that Speilberg is often faithful to his inspirational sources, I
    tried finding pics of Flying Crawl chapter titles seen in old Flash Gordon serials
    of 1936. \r\n\r\nOf the few I found (very poor resolution) it is evident that
    the visual effect of words gliding off to the distance is best achieved with justified
    copy. That way both left and right margins clearly follow one-point perspective.\r\n\r\nOddly
    enough, the Flash Gordon title seemed fairly well spaced, but too small to see
    any detail.\r\n\r\nI remember being slightly irked by the opening crawl in Star
    Wars Episode III, but really, I was too excited to care.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

    - much better than I expected. No stupid one-liners, very intense, both in emotion
    and action - reminds nicely of the original long, long ago, in a state of youth
    far, far away. I especially liked the little things, like catching a glimpse of
    the young Grand Moff Tarkin on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nBTW, I did notice <strong>some</strong>
    type: on the computers on Musafar. It looked a little bit like those ancient Hebrew
    Dead Sea inscriptions. But yeah, otherwise type was absent. And the titles? I
    was too excited to check. I can hear Jabba scoffing: \"He's no type Jedi!\"\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
