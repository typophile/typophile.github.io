  if someone has. But I just went and looked (and downloaded) the new version. I didn't
  check every weight, but WOW.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Which lead to my posting the following
  to the AAUP design list:</cite>\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I posted about Lato, a SIL
  OFL (Open Font License) font. Sans serif, created by professionals, interesting
  story behind it. Not going to repeat it, it's too long. A number of people used
  it at that time, but it lacked small caps, old-style figures, and many of the the
  niceties.\r\n\r\nNow, it seems version 2.0 is out.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latofonts.com/\r\n\r\nI
  only checked the medium weight, but...\r\n\r\nOld style figures.\r\nPolytonic Greek.\r\nCyrillic.\r\nAll
  the combining diacritics. Some of the combining diacritics supplements.\r\nFull
  IPA phonetics, and some supplements.\r\nAll of Latin Extended A (European languages,
  including Central and Eastern Europe)\r\nAll of Latin Extended B (many African languages).\r\nAll
  of Latin Extended Additional (romanized Indic scripts, romanized Arabic, Vietnamese).\r\nMuch
  of Latin Extended C (never needed it, but it's there...)\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nAnd not
  only in roman, but (at least medium) italic as well.\r\n\r\nNo small caps, outside
  those used in phonetics, but almost everything else one could wish for, all free,
  and free to use in print, digital, or web  publications. "

  body: "Apache license offers only one thing over and above the OFL license: You
    can take a free-for-the-world product that has thousands of hours of donated time
    put in by someone else, add a few hours our your own time, and create a product
    you can sell. Of course you *could* also donate of your time and skills, but you
    do have the option of selling.\r\n\r\nFine as long as eventual buyers are not
    misled about (1) what they are getting and (2) their other options.\r\n\r\nTwo
    things: \r\n\r\n1. Read <cite>Mountains beyond Mountains</cite> (authored by Tracy
    Kidder, about the early life of the doctor Paul Farmer). This to counter your
    knee-jerk notion that only money adds value. But if you want to press on,\r\n\r\n2.
    It would seem you can also do something equivalent with (at least some) of the
    fonts from the X-consortium. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter\r\n\r\nOn
    that page, go to External Links and download \r\n\r\nBitstream Charter con\xADvert\xADed
    into OTF, TTF and webfonts\r\n\r\nNow, open, say, the roman and look at the copyright.
    You find\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(c) Copyright 1989-1992, Bitstream Inc., Cambridge,
    MA. You are hereby granted permission under all Bitstream propriety rights to
    use, copy, modify, sublicense, <strong>sell,</strong> and redistribute the 4 Bitstream
    Charter (r) Type 1 outline fonts and the 4 Courier Type 1 outline fonts for any
    purpose and without restriction; provided, that this notice is left intact on
    all copies of such fonts and that Bitstream's trademark is acknowledged as shown
    below on all unmodified copies of the 4 Charter Type 1 fonts: \"BITSTREAM CHARTER
    is a registered trademark of Bitstream Inc.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nemphasis (in
    bold) added.\r\n\r\nI would, were I you, check on what seems to be the legal permission
    in the above copyright. Maybe \"modification to OpenType\" would somehow exceed
    the permission, though I can't see how, in part because there was no OpenType
    in 1992. \r\n\r\nBe advised that I plan to offer an expanded version of Charter
    (not Charis) as well, for <strong>free</strong>, after checking that above clause.
    For moral reasons, I also checked with Matthew. Mine is planned as a very extended
    version, but Latin alphabet only, no non-Latin, such as Armenian."

  body: "<blockquote>Fine as long as eventual buyers are not misled</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\nThe
    ethical trump card in making money by modifying libre fonts is that people can
    always get a free alternative, if it exists (and it probably couldn't exist if
    making money were not [ethically] possible).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>your knee-jerk
    notion that only money adds value.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNever said that, never
    even thought it.\r\nI rarely make minority fonts for money, I merely hope to reduce
    the losses from this labor of cultural love, mostly to lessen my material shortcoming
    in providing for my family of six.\r\n\r\nMy TypeCon talk will afford me 20 minutes
    to fully explain. Please come.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    revenue stream in the FLOSS world, and as far as I can see, the OFL does not forbid
    that at all.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to make up a library of mods that can
    be applied (by script, even) to a virgin font file when an order comes in; a bit
    like the new-car dealers."

  body: "I know that people get paid to modify OFL fonts, and that's certainly encouraging,
    but it remains that the client does not own the results, and that's often a deal-breaker
    (or it causes the fee to drop like a rock). Also, the retail world is entirely
    excluded.\r\n\r\nAs for the \"formulaic\" approach you mention concerning the
    derivation of non-Latin fonts (assuming I understood that correctly) I wouldn't
    know how to do that while yielding high-quality results (and I've never seen that
    done either). From my experience in making multi-script fonts I know that both
    the macro and micro decisions seem nearly impossible to automate.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "What I was thinking is based on using TTX as storage format since it's text.
    Text allows easy use of diff/patch and change control, common as sand on Linux/Unix
    systems.\r\n\r\n1. Dump a virgin font to TTX. (fresh.ttx)\r\n2. Make some changes,
    save the new font and dump it to TTX. (modded.ttx)\r\n3. diff -u fresh.ttx modded.ttx
    >changes.diff (changes.diff shows every difference between the two TTX files.)\r\n4.
    patch -Np0 -i changes.diff (By now fresh.ttx and modded.ttx should be identical.)\r\n\r\nIn
    theory, a process built on this should allow you to build a library or collection
    of modifications. In practice... there're always some differences between theory
    and practice."
