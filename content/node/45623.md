  would be perfect for, except that the client will need to display the titles of
  plays and musicals quite often. As Knockout has no italics or obliques, this takes
  it out of the running. This pains me deeply, as Knockout's range of styles and the
  historical design references its making are all perfect otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf you
  had to replace Knockout with a type family that sports obliques/italics, what would
  you choose?\r\n\r\nI've looked at a number of Grots and Gothics and haven't hit
  anything I like. I think its wood type pedigree makes it unique, and I'm having
  difficulty finding another sans with that characteristic and range. I want to the
  bullet and try to make it work anyway (specing single quotes rather than italics
  for titles), but I don't think the client will go for this restriction."

    \r\n\r\nDo you *need* italics? Couldn't you develop some of other way of pulling
    them out?"

  body: I'll second Maple. I had thought of it but wondered if what makes Knockout
    so perfect is all the widths, which Maple lacks.

  body: "Thanks for the recommendations, everyone. These are great.\r\n\r\nI admit
    I'm a timid designer who blanches at the thought of pushing and pulling type like
    that, but now you've got me interested in going a few rounds with Knockout (last
    boxing pun, I promise). The usage is primarily display work, but not exclusively.
    We did consider other methods of pulling out the titles, but the client was not
    excited about that prospect, and the battle was ultimately not worth waging.\r\n\r\nI
    like Balboa, but  Knockout has a quality to it that Balboa doesn't quite hit for
    me (Not a pun! I swear!). It's also possible that I've simply become so enamored
    with Knockout that I'm blinded a bit.\r\n\r\nI remember Maple now, from seeing
    it in <a href=\"http://typographica.org/001045.php\">Typographica's Favorites
    list of 2005</a>. What a fantastic family. Now I have to find a place to use this
    family as well. Its character is great, but that same character moves it away
    from the specific sort of visual references we were looking for.\r\n\r\nPart of
    the reason I was so remiss in responding to your recommendations is that the project's
    visual direction took on a different emphasis after my post and the work began
    to pile up, keeping me away from Typophile. In the end, I went with everyone's
    favorite ubiqui-sans of the early 21st century, <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\">Gotham</a>.
    It works ideally in this case, particularly with its wide range of weights. It
    turns out that the late 19th/early 20th century grot look of Knockout ended up
    being a bit too far back in the history books. We began looking for something
    that was a bit less forceful in its tone without losing its ability to proclaim
    its message boldly, as well as being more at home around the geometric influences
    of the 30's and Deco architecture, without going as far into the style as <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=615\">Neutraface</a>
    does.\r\n\r\nThank you all for the suggestions. They've given me some great options
    to have at the ready for work needing distinct gothics."
