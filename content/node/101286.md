  body: Hard to say, very few letters and, part of the /a, not so distinctive, one
    among a million of grotesk and even a custom job (Kasper Florio are well-known
    for their bespoke typefaces and modified versions of commercial releases). This
    said, the closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-old-face-pro|AG
    Old Face]] but I really can't be positive even if it looks to match the few specs
    we have (/a, /k).
