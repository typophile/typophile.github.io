body: I'm working on what's to be a small, hip fashion/lifestyle magazine. I've chosen
  too use Chronicle Text and Display and possibly Gotham Bold set in all caps for
  headlines. But I'm hoping to get some suggestions regarding a sans to pair with
  as an additional text face. I don't care for any of the Gotham's set small... Thanks
  so much for your input!

  body: "Hi Mario,\r\n\r\nI am hesitant to talk about, let alone recommend, my own
    font, but may I enquire why not one of the two you mention, then? I think not
    describing this is preventing people from being able to help you further.\r\n\r\nGraphik
    and Neutral are, quite similar, and simultaneously very very different.\r\n\r\nWe've
    obviously used Neutral from time to time, and currently we are using Graphik quite
    a lot. As a pure text face, both work nicely. I personally prefer Neutral's wider
    spacing and Basel*-like quiet in small and smaller sizes, but if there's a chance
    you'll use this sans in large sizes too, you should consider Graphik which is
    just so much Zurich*-style cleaner, crisper and more, eh, graphic (May I note
    that both faces get along astonishingly well with each other if you restrict one
    to very large, and one to very small sizes).\r\n\r\n* the Schools, not typefaces.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nKai\r\n\r\n"
