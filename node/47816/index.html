  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Have just found this site after a year and a half in design wilderness!</p>
<p>Am about to start a company called Bedouin Travel, it’s based in London and the main activities are: 1. Islamic Pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia and 2. General tours and holidays off the beaten track in the Middle East (Syria, Jordan, and Oman amongst others).</p>
<p>Am looking for a font that reflects the companies professionalism in a market full of amateurs, with a consistent and clean (i.e. not over fussy or elaborate) brand image. To make a similae with cars, when I started the project I was pitching the image level at around the Bentley/Aston Martin luxury level when that was not an accurate reflection of the product or the market I’m going for. Continuing the car similae, it’s more around the Audi/Lexus/Saab/Volvo level of image. Reliable, well made, high quality but not necessarily ostentatious, lives up to expectations and comfortable.</p>
<p>I have had a logo designed (see attached) which I do like because it hints at something of the east without necessarily being over-islamic because many of my customers won’t be. I could change the font of the logo but would need a very good reason to do so.</p>
<p>I’ve tried serif fonts (Palatino) not sure it works on web, and san-serif (Optimum - which I like but not sure it works for the brand and now Avenir - which I really like and is what I’m currently favoring but need reassurance on unless there is something much better)</p>
<p>I need to have my stationery printed and want something that satisfies web, business cards and letterhead as I’d like it to be consistent.</p>
<p>Any help would be gratefully received (ps. early draft of website is at <a href="http://www.bedouintravel.com">www.bedouintravel.com</a>)</p>
<p>Thanks
Saqib</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From all of what you&rsquo;ve said, I still don&rsquo;t understand why you want to change the type.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with it? I don&rsquo;t think changing the type will make your company any better or worse thought of.</p>
<p>If Audi, Lexus, Saab or Volvo used a serif typeface for their mark, it would make their cars no less reliable or well thought of. Equally, if Bentley or Aston Martin used Avenir it wouldn&rsquo;t knock fifty grand off the price.</p>
<p>In short, a logo alone does not make a good product or service, and you&rsquo;ve offered nothing to suggest why the current mark is unsuitable.</p>

<p>Did you purposely distort the bottom text? If you did, don&rsquo;t. If you didn&rsquo;t maybe I should see about getting some glasses.</p>

<p>Am I correct in understanding that you aren&rsquo;t looking replace the logo but that you are looking for a secondary typeface to use in your materials?</p>
<p>Palatino is a nice typeface, but it may be too similar to your logo. Avenir seems like a good choice. It&rsquo;s hard to say for sure without seeing it in use.  You could also try something like [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html#|Proxima Nova]]. Or look at [[http://www.typophile.com/node/36062|this thread]] which mentions several fonts similar to Avenir.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Saqib,</p>
<p>I also think you&rsquo;re scrutinizing the logo a bit too harshly.  The typeface is a great selection: appropriately professional and upscale.  The &ldquo;ligature&rdquo; between the &lsquo;r&rsquo; and the &lsquo;a&rsquo; creates a pleasant reference to Middle Eastern culture, and is uniquely clever and subtle.</p>
<p>I would also suggest eliminating the red reflective text.  It&rsquo;s an unnecessary element.  It just adds more stuff without enhancing the design.  What do you think about cumaso&rsquo;s suggestions for complementary typefaces?</p>
