  I should start? I''ve seen ''hamburger" used in type samples. Are those the best? '

  body: "\"hamburgefontsiv\" is used a lot because it uses most of the shapes you
    need to build other letters.\r\n\r\nI would look at letters with terminals, like:
    'S' and 'C', joins in letters like 'M' and 'A' and \u2013 since I need five of
    them \u2013 the question mark: '?'. \r\n'R', 'G', 'Q', 'g' and 'a' are also often
    treated differently (and probably many others as well).\r\n\r\nOoops. I cheated!"

    - it should be able to guess the font name based on these. '

    in Minion for me are acjty or MKQR5, whilst in Meta it's aegksy or CEGMS, or in
    Officina gimty or in Bliss bgyGW.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I guess I look at:\r\nlc:
