  company identifies as T389.  It's a casual script that is quite similar to Corinthia
  and Annabelle, but not exact.  I have a pic of the caps enclosed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some stationers actually have pre-digital type, or they use custom fonts,
    as a way to avoid customer 'end-runs'. This way they have something you cannot
    exactly duplicate, and so can justify their pricing. \r\n\r\nMy feeling is that
    this is not a commercial font available to the public. At least, I do ot recognize
    it, and could not find it in my Script Font ID Guide, for what that's worth.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks Mike!  I have found that to be less and less of a problem lately,
    as clients gravitate toward machine calligraphy over hand (I do both) - if they
    can't get someone to do their envelopes, which invitation suppliers like William
    Arthur don't do - they will stop purchasing from those vendors who sell unmatchable
    fonts.  Hence suppliers are more likely to give out the name, although some are
    still in the stone age.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the stationer was able to get me
    the name this morning, but the name she got was \"carlotta one pka\".  I have
    \"carlotta\" and while it is a casual script font, it is definitely not this one.
    \ I can't seem to find anything called carlotta one, nor carlotta one pka.  I'm
    happy to buy the font if I can find it, but it looks like I may have to use Corinthia
    and advise the client next time not to buy from William Arthur... ;-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Your point about envelope addressing is interesting, because to some extent
    it emphasizes the way the general public misuses fonts. Addressing envelopes should
    be a case (I think) where legibility for the post office should trump the desire
    to have everything done in the same script. My recommendation would be to pick
    an elegant Sans or Serif font that makes no pretense of looking like the invitation
    script, so that it's clear that the business of addressing an envelope is just
    to make sure the envelope reaches its destination.\r\n\r\nI would avoid the mundane,
    everyday fonts, and pick something distinctive, but I would avoid using a script
    style, especially a rather florid one like your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
