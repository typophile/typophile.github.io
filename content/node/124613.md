  body: "No firm definitions. \r\nHandtooled can mean a visual effect that suggests
    an embossed letter by using a variable shadowed section in the thicker strokes.
    \r\nOutline can mean that the outer line of a glyph parallels the next line inward,
    or vice versa. Such a font is sometimes called hollow. Sometimes terms like contour
    are used to describe the multiple application of parallel lines to produce a black
    glyph surrounded by a white stroke and then an outside black stroke.\r\nInline
    can mean various things, including where the glyph consists of unconnected lines.\r\nA
    related term, cameo, is sometimes used when the typeface is white inside a black
    box.\r\nDon"
