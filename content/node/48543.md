  for a font that, if actually written in, would make someone say, \"Hey, you have
  good handwriting.\" I'm not actually trying to fool anyone, I don't have the printing
  technology for that, I just think that's a good description of the font I'm looking
  for. Here are two fonts that are close:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=tekton\">Tekton</a>
  (too precise):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tekton&#91;1&#93;_3973.gif]\r\n\r\n<a

  ideas?"

    think it would be called \"print\" handwriting. There are a few at the top of
    this list of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/contemporary-handwriting-fonts/\">handwriting
    fonts</a>."

    described by what's it's not: i.e. it's \"disconnected\", or \"non-cursive\" script.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Nick. Of course you're right about \"script\". What about \"discrete\"
    handwriting? I'm not sure that would make it immediately clear, though, if I said,
    \"I'm looking for a neat, discrete handwriting font.\" And \"print handwriting\"
    is probably the most common, I should have thought of it. \"Print handwriting
    font\" might be confusing, though.\r\n\r\nI think I'll go with \"non-cursive\".\r\n\r\nI
    like a few of those from the FontFeed. And Soli Px is nice, but I'm struck by
    your avatar, spiral, it's adorable."

  body: "I created a non-script handwriting font for the creation a child's primer
    to teach handwriting, from formation of letters to clear easy-to-read handing.\r\n\r\nThis
    involved a few True Type fonts. Two of the fonts were very identical, featuring
    stand-alone versions of each letter, and same thing just with little arrows around
    each letter, indicating the correct manner to draw the letter.\r\n\r\nThe third
    font was extremely difficult to create, because each letter had a tail or extention
    to connect to the next letter. To achieve a perfect connection for every combination:
    the a with an a, the a with b, the a with c, the a with a d etc., the b with an
    a, the b with an e, etc. uppercase with lowercase; the widths of each letter had
    to be test and tweaked, requiring much much time.\r\n\r\nThere were some letters
    which did not have a baseline connection, but an upper connection, for example,
    an m with an o. So, there was a default baseline connection for m, and exception
    upper connection in a fourth font.\r\n\r\nThen, there were combinations that neither
    choice would work. So, I created a series of ligatures containing two or three
    letter combinations.\r\n\r\nThere is a new technology called OpenType where the
    position of floating glyph elements and the replacement of them can be programmed
    into contextual tables, so the abovwe goal could be achieved in only two or three
    fonts, and have much better, even near perfect results."
