body: "I'm trying to find three arabic fonts in order to print theatre book in arabic
  language. I'm looking for three elegant and easily legible fonts. One of the fonts
  is for the main text, another for the headings, titles..., ando another one to substitute
  italics. I think the Arabic language doesn't use italics and we need this kind of
  font in order to write stage directions. We need a type of font which clearly differentiate
  the main text from the stage directions, but which also complement each other in
  style.\r\nWe will also use latin words in some cases, so we need to find three arabic
  fonts and three fonts, if the arabic fonts don't already have latin characters,
  which match each one of the arabic font.\r\nUsually, in latin languages, in stage
  directions, we use capital letters in characters names. Should we use another arabic
  font in that case?\r\nThank you for your help."
