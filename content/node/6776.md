body: Hi, I am new here, so I apologize in advance for my lack of knowledge on this
  subject.  I&#39;ve been trying to do some research on licensing, and I haven&#39;t
  been to successful, so I&#39;ve decided the best way may be to simply post a question
  on a message board... <BR> <BR>I am trying to create a new corporate logo and was
  wondering what kind of licensing fees I could expect if using certain fonts or dingbats
  as part of the logo.  If this is possible, would it normally require an ongoing
  licensing fee or a one-time fee?  Does it matter if the logo will be used on products
  for resale as well? <BR> <BR>What if our logo contained art that used only certain
  elements from a dingbat, rather than the exact dingbat itself?  For example, what
  if I didn&#39;t want to use the dingbat as is but wanted to modify it?  Would the
  fee be the same? <BR> <BR>I would greatly appreciate any advice or help anyone has
  to offer.  Thanks!

  body: licensing probably varies from font to font, foundry to foundry. be sure to
    check out the EULA for a particular face. it should state any restrictions on
    usage there.
