DONT TAKE IT SEROUS! hahaha! I will have a mini CD on one of the sides of the cube but I need ideas into what I could turn it into i.e. what could be useful in a designers studio that could be made into from a cube? i.e. a dice but designers don&rsquo;t need a dice do they? No! Unless they have time to play Monopoly and have lost the dice, which I doubt happens in everyday life. So what would you suggest? What do you think? I thought of a container to put their pens and fineliners etc in but I want something more than that. Any ideas welcome, may they be bazzar or just plain simpe. Anything can spark ideas. Thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have two ideas for my CV. I am designing one that is typographically exciting and another that is interactive. Depends who I am sending them out to, what kind of company. If it is more interactive based, then my cube CV will be sent out. If it seems more interested in concepts etc than interaction, then the typographic one which will be simply A4 sized. I don&rsquo;t really have much clue on what i am doing for my typographic one yet as I need more inspiration. I may have illustrate my face with letters and numbers and use it as a stamp on my CV. Other than that, I was thinking of indicating margin sizes on my CV, indents, footer, header, ascenders, decenders, kerning, gutter width, typeface used, font size, headline, bodycopy etc etc. What do you think? let me know. I need to make it look exciting. How do you think i should go about it? Any ideas? Let me know, thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree. Avoid the gimmicks.</p>
<p>Things to consider when sending your CV and or portfolio to potential employers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They receive dozens of CVs, so they don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time interacting with yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is free of typos, decently designed and your experience meets their expectations, they will put you in the &ldquo;contact for interview stack.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the document simple. No color, no more than one page. Just a nicely designed, easy to navigate typographic document. Anything else will be seen as gimmicky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As stated above, &ldquo;gimmicks&rdquo; <strong>can</strong> work. But it has to be so amazing and innovative that the only next logical step is to hire you right away.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds to me like you&rsquo;ve come up with a solution - the cube - and now you are in search of the concept. This rarely works out well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am terribly sorry - but I disagree with the majority of you. Anyone can take a piece of &ldquo;white&rdquo; paper and put their resume on it (I&rsquo;m surprised you haven&rsquo;t recommended Times Roman for this.)</p>
<p>However, you are suppose to be creative - and that does not mean &ldquo;gimmicky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your CV should be very well designed. When it goes to the employer you are sending it to - you want it to be memorable.</p>
<p>Any of you familiar with Harris Levine (pronounce La-Wine)? He was an art director for Harcort Brace, ah years ago. He taught about typography at School of Visual Arts. He also looked alot like Humphrey Bogart. His resume was a black &amp; white photo of himself, complete with cigarette out of the side of his mouth &ndash; on the full sheet. The headline read, &ldquo;Would you hire this person?&rdquo; below in small white type was his credentials.</p>
<p>Not only was it original, it was one full class for his students. They all had to come up with the most creative type resume they could. It isn&rsquo;t easy &ndash; you must express yourself in your best light.</p>
<p>BTW - after college I worked in at NYU Graduate School of Business in admissions. Literally thousands of resumes showed up every day. They all looked the same. They were all one page - neatly typed. Every now and then one would come by that we&rsquo;d actually take a bit more than the average 5 seconds to look at.</p>
<p>If you are a creative person in life - then fortunately, you are not like everyone else in life. So why should your resume look like everyone elses? Unless of course, you are not going for a creative position, only another dishrag job&hellip;</p>
<p>P.S. Addition - that HL CV was done a good 25 to 30 years ago, and it is still embedded in my memory. Can you say that about any of the resumes you&rsquo;ve looked at in your lifetime?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Jackie. Most people who view your resume won&rsquo;t be hiring at all. Most jobs are not filled through publishing want ads. This means that you have to blindly send your resume to employers, i.e., the people getting it don&rsquo;t want to hire you. And they won&rsquo;t want to hire you until you change their mind. The only way to do this is to call attention to yourself in a positive way that says, &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;m creative. If you don&rsquo;t hire me, your competitors will. This will be your loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, even in your &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; cv, your type had better damn well be well set! Just because a company specializes in multimedia, or whatever, does not mean they they cannot or do not appreciate fine typography. It can make the difference, even when you don&rsquo;t expect it to. Besides, you never know what the person reading your cv knows. Put your best possible face forward.</p>

&ldquo;I need to make it look exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, no.</p>
<p>A CV should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>easy to read/legible</li>
<li>standard format</li>
<li>nothing else</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not overthink the CV. It&rsquo;s a practical piece of design. A definite form FOLLOWS function object. Let it be what it is. Pick a couple of nice typefaces, do some careful typesetting, proofread it, and call it finished.</p>
<p>As others have said, gimmicks are REALLY hard to pull off&hellip;mainly because a thousand people before you have already tried. Remember, designers are pretty much in the business of gimmicks (at least at some point in their career) so the odds of you coming up with something unique enough to trump not having the CV readable are slim to none.</p>
<p>Consider your CV like you would your wardrobe. You COULD show up to your interview in thigh-high leather, a pink boa, and purple tu-tu to try and &lsquo;stand out&rsquo; in the crowd. But no one is really going to hire you based on your wardrobe. They just care about your experience.</p>
<p>(I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a good analogy or not&hellip;I&rsquo;m up late with a sick kid just trying to stay away long enough to put him to bed&hellip;so I&quot;m not entirely thinking straight here&hellip;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your CV should be very well designed. When it goes to the employer you are sending it to - you want it to be memorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You want the CONTENT to be memorable.</p>
<p>I appreciate that the &lsquo;you are a creative applying for a creative position&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s what the portfolio is for. The resume is to sell HR. The portfolio to sell your Art Director.</p>

<p>Yes, this is true. But only if the company is big enough to have an HR department in the first place! Even a design studio with 10–20 employees is unlikely to have an HR department. In which case, either the secretary or the owner will open your mail. Both of these sorts of people are more susceptible to cool than HR people.</p>

<p>Graphic design isn&rsquo;t about &lsquo;cool&rsquo;, though. It&rsquo;s about &lsquo;communication&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The last time I did portfolio reviews for college grads, I was sent one student who everyone was raving about. The kid was &lsquo;cool&rsquo; and had really nailed down the MTV-esque style. It was a slick portfolio.</p>
<p>Then we got to a piece that had the same great MTV-esque style and he commented off-hand &lsquo;yea, it&rsquo;s good, but the client really hated it. Whatever&rsquo;</p>
<p>I start to look at the piece and notice it was a brochure for a septic tank company.</p>
<p>At that point, I realized that he wasn&rsquo;t a designer. He was a highly skilled and talented decorator. Alas, he wasn&rsquo;t able to grasp the context of the piece and apply the appropriate design solution.</p>
<p>If I see a &lsquo;cute&rsquo; resume, I think &lsquo;this person doesn&rsquo;t understand the basic functionality of a resume&rsquo; and would probably then label them a poor designer&hellip;albeit perhaps a great decorator.</p>
<p>IMHO, of course.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Patty and Aluminum,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in full agreement about no gimmicks.</p>
<p>But I feel as a designer, there should be something of a well-designed piece for the resume. Something to make it sing out so it is different from the other resumes. This of course, an be handled in type treatments (name in a display face, use of one body family in two weights) and well thought out.</p>
<p>However, I do know that every now and then one utterly fantastic resume comes along, and it is impossible to forget i.e. Harris Levine&hellip;</p>
<p>But just a boring, Times Roman, white paper, put the fact here, just the facts &ndash; may be skipped over and not leave an impression.</p>
<p>The key words then
Well-thought out and executed!</p>
<p>P.S. I remember one art director was in need of a fast resume, we put her in University Roman for her name, and it was odd - the font truly represented her and complimented (and complemented) her portfolio. I forgot what we used for the body copy&hellip; too many years have gone by.</p>

<p>Thats a very good point. There is not a single solution to this. I&rsquo;ve seen gimmicky resumes that were failures because the gimmick had nothing to do with the rest of the work. If you&rsquo;ve always wanted to work somewhere that is obsessed with cubes, squares and gemotric CV&rsquo;s, send them your cube, so to speak.</p>
<p>If you want to work somewhere well paying, classy, boring and bureaucratic, send them 12pt TNR with broad even margins, and no abbreviations.</p>
<p>It is up to you, but if you go for a gimmick, make sure it is one that  actually communicates something about you, the company, or both. If it doesn&rsquo;t do that, skip it and save your effort for something else.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I remember only one CV that I have ever seen - from the first designer to work on Jack Spade bags, a guy from Art Center. It was laid out in a 2D graph, and as a piece of information design, was exceptionally impressive.</p>
<p>I never suggested to use Times New Roman, and make it look like &ldquo;everyone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo; But this CV I refer to was on one sheet of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper, in black and white only.</p>
<p>And I repeat, the successful conception and execution of a really unique presentation is exceedingly rare. If you can do it, more power to you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In about two days i&rsquo;m going to be moving up to Seattle, WA with a job in design that I got while working in Tucson, AZ. My resume/CV was type set in basic font family with black ink on nice white stock. Simple and very clean. You could almost say I was applying for a sales position it was so boring. We&rsquo;ll the job flew me up, hotel and car for the weekend and hired me two days later. Now one of my best friends who I used to work with in Tucson also moved up to Seattle about 5 months ago. He&rsquo;s probably a better designer than myself but he&rsquo;s still struggling to find a job. He&rsquo;s resume is very well designed on very nice colored stock and with a *personal logo. I really liked his design and look but he&rsquo;s still jobless. (he&rsquo;s picky as well tho) but I have a job.. The first job I applied too. A cubed resume is just a gimmick and nothing else. type set the resume very well and use a good sense of white space to make it pop.</p>
<p>*And don&rsquo;t put a personal logo, Your applying to work for there company, not your&rsquo;s..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m coming to this thread late, but thought I would relate a true story&hellip;</p>
<p>Years ago I designed and produced a 3D cube Christmas gimmick for our clients' amusement in the festive season. The cube was about 3 inches square on each side and was self-tensioning with an internal rubber band, so that it effectively assembled itself as it came out of the envelope. The only information it had on the outside was our company branding, our closing dates over the holidays, and a bit of seasonal decoration. It had no other function, but required four colour printing, a custom-made die, heavy-duty laminating and a lot of (expensive) hand-finishing. We ran less than a 100 off. The clients, almost without exception, got pissed at the office parties and played football with the cubes. In most cases the &lsquo;goals&rsquo; were, yep, the waste paper baskets.</p>

<p>Yeah, but what use is it, as you ask in your original request? Whether a sheet of paper or a cube, it&rsquo;s still a blank canvas. You&rsquo;re really asking for the content, which in the case of a resume should be a representation of your own problem-solving abilities.</p>
