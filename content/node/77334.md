body: "Over the past couple of years I've become really interested in fonts.  I'm
  a maths teacher by day and amateur designer and now amateur typographer by night
  (and by weekend and school holiday).  I have designed a font before, but I made
  every rookie mistake possible.\r\n\r\nSo then I bought this very helpful book titled
  'Lettering & Type: Creating Letters and Designing Typefaces' by Bruce Willen and
  Nolen Strals which I am thoroughly enjoying and from which I am learning a lot.
  \ I also learn a lot from typophile.com and from just observing the world around
  me - that's one thing I love about type, it's everywhere.\r\n\r\nMy first font is
  called 'happy pebble'.  The look is based on this idea I got for the lower case
  'a'.  In my mind it looked a bit like a sculpted pebble you might find on the beach.
  \ I've only yet completed the lower case characters and the project still hasn't
  left Illustrator.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI've followed an evolutionary process so that
  whoever is helping me out can see where I was going and a bit of what I was thinking.
  \ Each letter's version that I liked the most and felt the most fitting is in a
  bluish purple with the unchosen ones in black:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/happy
  pebble-01.png\"/>\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/happy pebble-02.png\"/>\r\n\r\nHere
  are also some words I created in Illustrator to get a feel of the letters working
  together (and to test out some variations of a specific character):\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/happy pebble-03.png\"/>\r\n\r\nI am very new at
  this but I find it very exciting.  I still have much to learn, so please let me
  know what you think (my friends and family thinks its great, but they are biased)."

  body: "A pleasing start.\r\nYou may find uppercase forms more difficult to fit into
    the scheme--unless you plan to make them all larger lowercase forms, like your
    A.\r\nI don't think it makes much sense to make the dot of /i/j/ into that drop
    shape."

  body: "Try to be more rigid, and give no room for any deviation. Your O works well
    with Odam.\r\n\r\nSorry; I can see your goal with those modular forms, and I like
    the overall design, but you just can not build every glyph with your modules.
    (Well, you can, but I'm not telling you how)."

  body: "Good work. Once you established \"a\" as your building brick, I think you
    should abandon it as a glyph\u2026 or at least try a mirrored one (with a bottom
    right angle)."
