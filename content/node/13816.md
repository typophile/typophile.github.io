    P could be a modified B or R from the same font; those letters have the extended
    crossbar.\r\n "

  body: The font is called "Twentieth Century Poster1" (Monotype). Can't find an URL
    with an online showing of the font. It's not the same font as the Twentieth Century
    Poster font which is currently offered by Monotype Imaging.
