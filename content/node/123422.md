  worked in design for some twenty years and I'm writing my dissertation for my postgraduate
  in graphic design and typography. I've been asked to research the papers of John
  Peters, designer to Cambridge University Press, creator of Castellar, Petrus and
  Fleet Titling. Peters has some 7 boxes of his papers in the archives at the University
  Library in Cambridge but he is proving very elusive. I've yet to find his obituary
  or a record of whether he had children. An obscure query for a forum such as this
  but maybe worth asking.  I'm off to track down any contacts in the city. I have
  found a beautiful, tiny specimen print of Petrus - the 4 1/2pt bible print that
  he created and his original drawings which are wonderful to see.\r\n\r\n "
