  body: Although the uppercase indeed resembles Perpetua,   <BR>the lowercase &#39;a&#39;,
    &#39;g&#39; and &#39;y&#39; look very <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=usherwood&amp;page=3"

  body: I&#39;ve taken more samples from another image and their homepage. The flash
    on this site have replaced the poster font for another one, and they only used
    the CAPS for the title &#40;probably gaven by the design company that made the
    poster in vectorial format - paths&#41;. Here&#39;s more 2 bigger samples, if
    that&#39;s not enough I&#39;ll go there and take a macro for you <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>- the g tail is opened! Like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caxton-2"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caxton-2</a> Caxton, but
    the M is too Wide.. <BR> <BR>- the &#34;y&#34; tail has a vertex <BR> <BR>- the
    inside of &#34;e&#34; is is slanted if remember correctly. <BR> <BR>Happy hunting!
