body: I designed a logo using the Coffee Shop typeface from YWFT ([[http://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T3310/coffee-shop]]).
  I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a complementary font that I can
  use for the header slogan and header bars on the blog this logo is to go on. I wanted
  something with a certain deconstructedness to it, but handwritten fonts don't really
  match well. I'm open to any suggestion because I'm stumped at this point. Thanks!

    I like the look of Josefin slab ([[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/josefin-slab]]).
    Even though I''d prefer a font that I pay for, I didn''t really see any that compared. '

    hear that sentiment!  :-)\r\n\r\nThat said Josefin seems like a decent choice
    (although I'd be wary of the spacing - many Google fonts are sadly deficient in
    that respect). You could also take Lubalin Graph and make the ascenders and descenders
    much longer (not too hard in this case). And that way you'd have a font nobody
    else has (instead of a free font that every Joe could use).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
