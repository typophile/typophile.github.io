  like that he's the first to admit that it's unreadable. Again, a quick and dirty
  encode. You'll almost be able to smell the roses in that vase next to him on the
  actual DVD... \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n-Gary"

  body: Very nice. I like it that he makes it clear that the typeface was just a experiment,
    not really made to be readable.

  body: "I\u2019m not sure why he changed the basic roman forms. He explains that
    the objective of the typeface was to overcome the technical limitations of the
    low resolution output. However, the typeface could have come out more legible
    while still adhering to the 90\xB0 and 45\xB0 concept had he stuck to the basic
    forms. It seems like he was taking a chance at creating something revolutionary
    and experimental rather than really solving the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks Gary. Can\u2019t
    wait for the DVD! Already pre-ordered."

  body: "<cite>It seems like he was taking a chance at creating something revolutionary
    and experimental rather than really solving the problem.</cite>\r\n\r\nShortly
    after Crouwel published the pamphlet (1967), Gerard Unger, who at the time was
    a student at the Rietveld Academy, published his response, entitled <cite>A Counter-proposal.</cite>\r\n\r\nHere's
    a detail from Unger's response pamphlet (bad photo taken at the breakfast table
    this morning with an iphone... sorry), which uses the concepts from Crouwel's
    proposal but applies them to more readable letterforms:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unger1_5539.jpg]\r\n\r\nUnger's
    manifesto from the back cover:\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason in developing an alphabet
    which takes a totally new form. The introduction of such an alphabet requires
    an adaptation of men. It would be more logical to adapt the machine.\r\n\r\nMachines
    exist. They have been contructed by technicians, whose primary aim was to achieve
    a very fast composing machine. This was their concern.\r\n\r\nLetters are my concern.
    Letters, as elements of words and sentences, are used to communicate. Such communication
    must be as clear as possible, whatever the shape of the letters. This is the main
    criterion.\r\n\r\nAn adaptation of old letterforms, to the new techniques and
    the old reading habits, is in my opinion the most reasonable solution. I wish
    to remain as close as possible to the old letterforms, owing to the fact that
    these have the most readability.\r\n\r\nI reject reproduction of old letterforms
    by new machines. The retangular pattern creates too great a disfiguration. When
    a Garamond face is used, the printed result is no longer recognizable as a Garamond.
    By doing so, the control of quality is lost, because the end result differs too
    greatly from the original. Too many of the finer points are lost.\r\n\r\nIt will
    be necessary to invent new refinements for the old forms which can be faithfully
    reproduced by the new machines.\"\r\n"

  body: "I was thinking of the same thing when I posted earlier and watching the clip.\r\n\r\nWhen
    he was talking he had the letter 'a' on the table (the flipped L form), I questioned
    why it looked like that, <em>even if</em> it's just an experiment. Something more
    resembling an 'a' is obviously possible even with only 90 and 45 degree angles.
    Unger's solution seems more logical in my opinion. But maybe if Crouwel had designed
    something that 'normal', it might not have been in the spotlights as much or be
    as interesting as it was now."
