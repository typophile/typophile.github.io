  also open to similar styles if what you have in mind looks kind of like the above
  images but isn't quite right. I'm kind of partial to Indelible Victorian Regular
  (http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?productid=275783) as well, if it weren't
  quite so hard to read! \r\n\r\nThanks for any help! I've been scouring the internet
  trying to figure this out but I'm pretty new to typography. "
