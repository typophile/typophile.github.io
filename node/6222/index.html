		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Come on, by the middle of Saturday you could have had a strong idea how many extra books you'd be left with&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, if you really think anyone was worrying about what to do with the stack of books <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or even looking at them<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Saturday during the conference, you've obviously never worked in those kind of conditions. The conference team has to spend a huge amount of energy simply to stay on top of all the aspects of the conference that have been planned for, to keep everything running smoothly. They do not have time to come up with creative solutions to every unforseen circumstance, although they must handle many unexpected things; their priority must always be to concentrate on the steady operation of the conference as planned. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, by Sunday morning a lot of people who had received tokens for the book had not picked up their copy yet, because they were waiting until the last minute so they would not have to carry it around. I doubt very much if anyone on the team was keeping a tally of the books: it wasn't a priority. As to giving the books away: it would have cost ATypI a lot of money to ship them back to England, and then what should have been done with them? They would still be sitting in Sharon Moncur's office, waiting for the additional expense of moving them somewhere from where they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be sold and some money might filter back to the association. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally (and I mean finally, because this is a bloody silly conversation), let me recount another circumstance of the conference. I produced 150 copies of a software CD to be distributed to attendees of the Font Technology Forum. I guessed we would have a max of 100 attendees, but I didn't want to run the risk of not having enough. I paid to have the CDs produced and to have them shipped to Rome. In the end, I had about 60 left over, which were handed back to me by the conference team on the Sunday afternoon. What did I do? I wandered around and handed them out to anyone who happened to be in the lobby. Now, I'm sure there are some people who would have liked a copy who didn't get one, and there are some people I would have liked to give one to whom I didn't see in the lobby at that time. If I'd thought about the CDs at any time after the Thursday afternoon, I would have realised that there were extra copies that could be handed out to 'deserving' people. Frankly, the CDs were the last thing on my mind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I had been one of the people who carried away an armful of books to save them from an ignominious fate, I would glady send a copy to anyone who did not receive one in Rome who was willing to pay postage. As it is, I only have one extra copy, but I'll send it to Matha if he shuts up about it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kudos to ATypI for adding this special membership level, and making it happen so quickly. We should all strive to make this a truly global community; I think we're making great strides. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Based on Hrant's post, which has a delightful air of challenge, I will point out that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SOTA<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has a history of offering inexpensive membership fees and conference admission. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SOTA already offers a reduced membership fee of $35USD per year for all members residing outside North America. This membership level is deemed Global Professional, and carries the exact same benefits as the regular Professional membership level (which is $60USD). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The annual SOTA conference, TypeCon, is already priced so low that I don't know how it could go any lower, unless SOTA were awarded some outrageous endowment (not that we're not trying!). Registration is under $150USD for professionals, and less than $100USD for students. When we announce the exact admission fees for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TypeCon2003<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a few weeks, I think people will be pleasantly surprised. SOTA members receive a 20% discount off conference admission. Speakers and volunteers get in free. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the price of conference admission, TypeCon2003 includes 3 days of programming (accompanied by refreshments; ask Ray Larabie about the cookies), free admission to some very cool evening events, and more of the good things you expect from an event produced by our community.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If anyone wants to discuss SOTA and TypeCon further, let's move over to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SOTA SIG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here at Typophile. This is ATypI's thread, and they should have it all to themselves.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
