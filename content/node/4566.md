body: doing the spring cleaning thing - found an old CD with this &#34;Asswipe&#34;
  font. it&#39;s a really great script actually. and I&#39;m thinking of using it
  on some wedding invites. but I&#39;m wondering where in the world I got it - I&#39;m
  not sure that I own it, unless I picked it up on some free promo thing some years
  ago. <BR> <BR>can&#39;t find it anywhere. who claims this fame eh?

  body: ah-swee-pay will sound better to the client if they ask what I used on their
    wedding invites eh? haha <BR> <BR>$30 aint&#39; bad at all - but if it was free
    in 96 then that sounds about right. still I may cover my ah-s

  body: I believe chank had a free version. The one you purchase is the &#39;deluxe&#39;
    version. <BR> <BR>But chank&#39;s a good guy, so tossing him $30 is a good thing.
