  body: "Thank you, gentlemen. :-) This really doesn't have much post processing done
    to it. Just caught the light and shadows at the right time, I guess.\r\n\r\nI
    don't have any full-resolution shots online. My photos on my site are about this
    size. This one would be too big at full-resolution, anyway. I'm going to print
    it on canvas at 36\"x24\". I hope it will be a cool abstract. \r\n\r\nThanks again. "
