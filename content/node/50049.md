    I believe the supplied sample may have been horizontally scaled a bit, too.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/chaparral_pro_caption/?sample_text=TEQUILA&acs_ss=15\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes. I think you are right.\r\n\r\nThe key to this ID seems to be the length
    of the legs of the \"A\". I found several fonts that were quite similar. But with
    all of them, the legs on the \"A\" were too long.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for
    helping out with this!"
