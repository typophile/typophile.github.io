  Shot is selling!!! Shipping out the first few prints today!!\r\n\r\nI used an old
  school (some might call it trailer park) technique of tripling the zoom capabilities
  of my crappy canon point and shoot and zoomed in on the dollar symbol character
  of my portable typewriter I picked up awhile ago now. I basically left the raw image
  untouched by Ps and sent it over my agent/manager and she said holy crap wow we
  can sell this image all over everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe prints are really kick ass!!
  They measure 24\" by 24\" and feel deep moody broody like. I chose to print the
  image on a heavy stock archival paper with a semi-gloss/mat  finish.\r\n\r\nSo yeah
  lads and ladettes, beers on me!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nn.  "
