  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am in  the process of adding Greek and Cyrillic glyphs to my Weimar Plakat 1923 typeface and was talking to Dan Reynolds about it. He asked me if there was a constructivist heyday in Greece at the same time as the Russian Avant Garde and German Bauhaus.  I told him I didn't think so because it was a troubled time in Greece then.  Since I said that, I began to wonder if anyone knew more about it? Perhaps Gerry Leonedis, John Hudson or any other student of visual history might be more knowledgeable and share their insight?

		<div class="commentbody">Of course one can't really cram all things "constructivist" under one roof. What I'd really be interested to know is if there was any sort of dialogue between Greece and the West, or between Greece and Soviet Russia at this time.

Malevich, Van Doesberg, El Lizitsky, Jan (here Iwan) Tschichold, Paul Klee, Kurt Schwitters, Mondrian, et al. … these people didn't all have much in common with everyone else necessarially, but in hindsight it is easy to put them all in the same "box," even if that oversimplifies things. Did they have any "copiers" in Greece? Artists trying to follow along the same lines?

Were there Greek Communists/Bolsheviks? What did their graphics look like?  Soviet Russia laid heavy on the propaganda during the 1920s and 30s. Did any of this make it to Greece?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am one of the "enquiring minds who wants to know" all that as well Dan:-) Thanks for adding your wisdom and clarifying my question.
I would be curious if it were just a Central and Eastern Europe thing? Eventually Italy ended up with its birth of Modernism and the oft blasted Massimo must have learned his trade somehow but Greece? xero ego?
