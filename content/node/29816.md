body: "I'm in the roots process of creating a new identity system for myself, and
  wanted to know what the growing consensus on some topics were.\r\n\r\n1. My name
  versus a clever amalgamation  example: Andrew Sipe Vs Clever Amalgamation Designs\r\nIs
  this professional? Is it acceptable? Is it the way to go if I'm the only person
  using it, i.e. no other employees in this company?\r\n\r\n2. Tagline : Yes or No
  or should I just use a title like graphic artist/designer/communicator? \r\nIs it
  necessary to have a tagline/title line at all when creating a personal identity?\r\n\r\n3.
  What are some resources or guidelines I should consider familiarizing myself with
  when creating my identity system. I'm guessing there isn't much difference between
  a personal ID system and a professional company ID system, but I could be mistaken.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sure I'll have more questions as this topic develops out, until
  then I'd be happy to read your honest insights and opinions on the subject. \r\n\r\nThanks"

    only. \r\n\r\nI guess going any root is perfectly fine then. I was kinda hoping
    there might be more of an argument against the common \"so-and-so design\" formula
    a lot of artist/designers use when creating a personal identity. Perhaps an argument
    like:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The artist/designer who tacks on \"design\" shows little creative
    energy to their own personal identity, might translate to showing the same energy
    for the customer's projects... \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\u2022 the artist/designer who
    uses their own name as the company name might translate to having an egocentric
    attitude...\r\n\r\nor for it\r\n\r\n\u2022 there could be positives to using their
    own name, especially if the artist/designer is well known or their name is extremely
    unique and would lend. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure, I don't want to come off
    as pompous and I don't want to seem immature or under experienced to potential
    clients/new employers. If I use a name other than my own, I'd have to justify
    it some way, at least in my own mind. "

    I would avoid using  words like 'design', 'studio', 'communication', 'solutions'
    altogether. I know its hard but I just feel these words are being used too freely,
    incorrectly and are starting to lose meaning (kind of like the ever popular swoosh
    on a 'professional' logo as a visual element).\r\n\r\n<cite>The artist/designer

    agree. \r\n\r\n<cite>the artist/designer who uses their own name as the company
    name might translate to having an egocentric attitude\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nWho
    says you have to be a 'company'? Just be honest with yourself and you're clients
    will see it. Don't try to be something your not (not saying you are BTW). It's
    just you. And if you feel that this might come off as amaturish or small then
    it's your job to convince potential clients that staying small allows for a more
    personal and effective design approach. Which i feel it does.\r\n\r\n<cite>there
    could be positives to using their own name, especially if the artist/designer
    is well known or their name is extremely unique and would lend.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    don't have to be well known. Personaly I would just use your name. It has a certain
    'ring' to it.\r\n\r\nWhen designing my identity I wanted to emphasize my bilingual
    design skills. I used two methods. The first was my name Ivan Melendez. The second
    was the word 'graphic design' (not graphic designer) in both english and spanish
    seperated by a virgule. \r\nI used a simple typographic logo (the letter 'M' surrounded
    with different glyphs set in differnt fonts) to emphasize the heavy influence
    typography has on my work.\r\n\r\nKeep it clean and simple. In fact, the less
    info the better in my opinion. It allows for questions about what you do, that's
    your opportunity to impress them with what you have to say. Much better than having
    the things you do on a card. In my case. I chose not to use the word 'typography'
    or 'typographer', not many people know what it is or how important it is to effective
    design.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense. In the end it's really up to you. As you
    grow you can always change your identity to reflect such growth.\r\n\r\nIM"

    result in a 'me too' kinda feel. It's such a matter of personal space. There are
    no set rules, no right and wrong answers. \r\n\r\nI live in Reading PA (will be
    attending Kutztown University in the near future Asvetic) and there are several
    \"design studios\" in the area who's work I can only describe as craptacular.
    Almost all off them use the word 'design', 'studio' or 'communication'. My choice
    to not use these words came from the desire to seperate myself from this group,
    and it's worked. That's not to say I would not choose to use one of these words
    if my business would grow and have employees under my direction. But I would have
    to had developed a solid reputation for myself in order for that to happen so
    I won't be mistaken for a lesser studio.\r\n\r\nAsvetic we should talk some time

    a little. For a company that emphasizes brand strength they sure put the name
    \"Igor\" on everything. Like \"Igor agency\", \"Igor naming guide\", \"Igor-created...\",
    \"Igor Naming and Branding Meta Blog\". Very redundant.\r\n\r\n<cite>Have you
    done any strategy forming for your company yet? What are your goals, the feel
    of your company, etc.<cite/>\r\n\r\n\r\nHaven't really formed any strategies,
    since I'm realtively new at this, I figured I would allow the flow of specific
    work to guide what my 'company' will do primarily. I am leaning towards strengthening
    the bilingual aspect of my work as most of my work involes designing in both languages
    for clients. I will say, however, that I never refer myself as a company (it's
    just me and it's too corporate in my opinion. Besides, what if someone asks me
    how many people are in my \"company\"? I'll have to say \"just me\", and look
    silly in my opinion)\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the second question. My goal is
    to offer effective design without all the  \"fluff\". In the area I live in I'm
    often faced with \"design solutions\" that really don't do much, don't function.
    I also try to tackle what I call relevant design issues. In other words, I look
    to make designs that are truly useful and long lasting in their benefit. For example,
    I'm currently designing bilingual patient information forms for a hospital who's
    number of hispanic patients grow every day. I really enjoy this job because I
    feel I'm doing good work. I'm not trying to sell someone something they don't
    need, or designing for something or someone I don't belive in. I'm designing something
    that will aid in effective healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe feel I'm trying to send out
    is approachability (which is why i'll always try to stay small). That anyone can
    approach me with a design problem, big or small, and expirience the same level
    of passion and dedication. I also allow my design to take on a humanistic approach.
    Often relying on the emotion behind it all to guide me to a solution. Yes, form
    design may seem boring to some and it's pretty unglamourous, but to me I think
    about the patient who is scared and confused when coming into the hospital and
    has a difficult time communicating because of the language barrier. That drives
    me."

    want to look at Bauhaus Design which was design for a purpose that was supposed
    to be affordable so that everyone could enjoy good design. Also maybe Edward R
