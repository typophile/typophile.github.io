  but none of the fonts I can think of --Poetica Chancery IV, Poliphilus, Tribute
  --have them. \r\n\r\nAny idea?\r\n\r\nAlso, is the author name the same font?\r\n\r\nAnd
  has this font been distressed? Or is this distressed \"out of the box\"?\r\n\r\nFYI:
  I had trouble attaching an image before. Hence the repeated post.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bloodwork_4059.gif]"
