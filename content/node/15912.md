  do put nodes at extremes? From what I understand, at one point software would get

    it because you have auto-converted scans of glyphs? What's the context?

  body: "I have been trying to think about beziers differently. I've noticed with
    my recent stuff how much the traditional placement of the node points has been
    influencing my work. I've been experimenting drawing letters  'free form' without
    the nodes at the extremes and it's producing some interesting things. Maybe I'll
    insert all of the proper nodes at the extrema when it's time to export the font.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the other things I've been doing is forcing myself to insert extra points.
    I learned to use as few points as possible when I was first learning because it
    was hard to keep the letters from becoming lumpy. Now I want them to be a little
    lumpy, because I can control the curves a little better. Here's an example. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ns.png]\r\n\r\nNotice
    that the curve on the top-right of the n on the right is impossible with just
    the two points at the extremes. The third anchor with control points at 45 degrees
    allows an interesting and less common curve.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture

    funny. Most designers think about the curves this way - as a necessary evil. I'm
    fascinated by them. They are powerful because they are constrained. That's why
    they were invented: because there is a limited set of possibilities for every
    curve, it's easy to create smooth (limited) curves. They make curved lines as
    rational as straight lines. \r\n\r\n> <em>with pencil & paper, beziers will have
    a lesser influence. </em>\r\n\r\nThat may be true, but I like the influence of
    the beziers in my work. For one thing, my hands are really shaky :) Whether people
    realize it or not, the limitations in the curves have influenced type design,
    I think in a good way. With the curves I often make shapes that I wouldn't have
    thought of if I were drawing by hand, but to your point, the converse is also
    true. The limitations in the curves make each one beautiful (string them together
    and it's another story). They can also be boring.\r\n\r\nI've also started trying
    to draw with quadratic beziers. Because they are even more constrained than cubic
    curves, you have to string them together. The are a lot harder to manage, but
    they force me to think about the curves differently, and their tendency to get
    lumpy faster in some ways makes them more flexible."

    about.\r\nInstead of drawing with curves though, I hash things out with straight

    it looking like a Pressig type, then I use FLabs line segment to curve tool to
    sculpt in the curves.\r\n\r\nI guess more than anything, I think it's refreshing
    to mix up your technique. If you do it the same way all the time, your type will
    start looking the same, because it will be a result of the technique as much as
    your brain. I recently went out and bought linolium block print stuff. I've been
    carving into that for some ideas on a poster. My spouse comments that the results
    don't *look* like my designs. This makes me happy, and it's really fun to dig
    away at the lino. Much more fun than tweaking beziers!\r\n\r\nMy problem: too
    MUCH experimentation, not enough production work. Sooo many single font types
    on my hardrive missing uppercase, or numbers, or monetary symbols, etc because

  body: "You can get away with an absence of extremum points on short curve segments
    in PS fonts, as in Miguel's example from Minion Pro, but even if you are not using
    them to define curves they should be added to any major bowls or arches because
    they are needed for reliable hinting.\r\n\r\nIn TrueType fonts, the format is
    more demanding of points on extremes, especially at the outer edges of a glyph.
    If they are missing, it messes up bounding box calculations and has an impact
    on hinting. I had some short, shallow curves in my Ethiopic typeface that did
    not have nodes at extremes, and Tom Rickner sent it back to me requesting that
    they be added before he started hinting.\r\n\r\nThe CFF specification allows for
    PS fonts with a non-1000 UPM, and I've been using larger UPMs for most recent
    projects (including one design with a UPM of 4096). This makes it easier to add
    extreme points on shallow curves without distorting the design. With a higher
    UPM, you can make much more finely detailed designs; this is particularly useful,
    of course, for display types that will be used at sizes that reveal such detail."

    Values such as 1000, 2000, 2048, 4000, 4096 etc. all work well. There are no known
    limitations or side-effects. \r\n\r\nOpenType PS fonts (.otf) typically have the
    UPM size of 1000 but other values are possible as well. There are some side-effects
    for fonts with non-1000 UPM sizes. One is that *certain components* of some Adobe
    applications such as InDesign CS (there may be others, I haven't checked extensively)
    *assume* that an OpenType PS font has the UPM size of 1000. Precisely: a non-1000
    OTPS font will show and print fine in InDesign CS but the *text cursor* will always
    be 1000 units high. So if your font has the UPM size of 2000, the text cursor
    while you edit the text in InDesign will be only half-size of the type. I'd say
    it's a cosmetic bug but it is one. \r\n\r\nThere may be other problems as well.
    Unfortunately, since Adobe does not make non-1000 OTPS fonts, they do not test
    their applications with such cases. Therefore, I encourage everybody to build
    non-1000 OTPS fonts, test them in all environments that are available to you,
    and file bug reports to the respective companies. You can always cc adam at fontlab

    PS fonts must have the \".otf\" extension. OpenType TT fonts may either have the

    All FontLab products generate OpenType TT fonts with the \".ttf\" extension and
    OpenType PS fonts with the \".otf\" extension. \r\n\r\nSo, strictly speaking,
