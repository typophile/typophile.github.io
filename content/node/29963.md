  body: It's very fortunate that they moved away from that format, at least. Looking
    at some state and local government pages, it would appear that they've been ripping
    of the brass-plate, stupid icons look for 12 years now without any signs of letting
    up.

    and from a navigation standpoint, was pretty intuitive (unlike some websites I
    could name!).  And when you think of the limitations of HTML 2....\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer:
    My old ISP in Washington did much of the early work with the White House, and
    started up the USPS site as well.)"
