body: "I'm putting together a proof of concept for a modern illuminated manuscript
  of the Bible.  I have in mind something combining the aesthetic of the beautiful
  medieval manuscripts with some of the techniques and principles of modern graphic
  design.  I'm looking for both body and title text, but the body text is certainly
  the trickier one.  Specifically, I'd like a serif font that is beautiful and legible,
  that hints at old English without the illegibility of old English.  \r\n\r\nIt would
  also be fantastic if I could find something that has a free version that I could
  use for proof-of-concept.  Any thoughts?"

    the St John's Bible. It's fairly complete and retains the handwritten look of
    the bible. I have not shared to so far. Let me know if you have any interest.\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n"
