  body: 'Ooops! Wrong freeware font. It is one called &#39;Daniela&#39; which is the
    only version of C&amp;G Calligraphy that I know of that you can still find. See
    the sample below from Part 2 of the Script Font ID Guide: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42172.gif"

  body: It looks like someone did some further modifications to the original font.
    If you can&#39;t use freeware, then buy El Greco and modify it, if the license
    permits.  <BR> <BR>If you can&#39;t do that then I suspect you&#39;ll have to
    generate all of it yourself. Those are the only fonts like that I know, anyway.

  body: It appears to be Southern Software&#39;s &#40;SSi&#41; bastardization of <BR>El
    Greco called Aria Script. SSi was the company that put <BR>out lots of those &#34;1500-Fonts-For-A-Pittance&#34;
    CD&#39;s and was <BR>successfully sued by Adobe and others for ripping off their
    <BR>fonts. <BR> <BR>El Greco is, by the way, a Berthold font &#40;you probably
    knew <BR>that already, eh?&#41;.
