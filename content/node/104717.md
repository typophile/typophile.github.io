  body: "I see - we are redesigning a website and the client uses this for their headlines
    - the X-height on a standard small cap is too low makes it seem awkward. Small-cap
    in CSS is even smaller than that. \r\n\r\n"

  body: you might just have to make them as images & customize the x height from software.
    indesign is a simple preference setting. i think standard is 70%. of course, opentype
    is a whole different story as it carries its own idea of what to do.
