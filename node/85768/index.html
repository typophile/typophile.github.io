  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've completed a three-weight font with class kerning and everything. The font has many glyphs with alternates, but now after looking the font for awhile, I'm having second thoughts. I'd like to switch the alternate as the main character, for example, /four with /four.alt and /S with /S.alt and so on. Is there any easy way to change all instances of a glyph and its name in a font (including kerning, classes, code, etc)? Any macros or scripts that could handle this? I'm working with Fontlab 5.04.

EDIT: Anyone? Please help, it's a two days of manual work there, all very prone to mistakes.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Here's a small script I wrote for renaming glyphs. It assumes Robofab is installed. You type in two list of glyph names--the current ones and the ones you'd like to replace them with. With your particular task, you'd probably have to run it three times--once to change your standard names to a temporary name (e.g., a.temp), once to change your alt glyphs to standard names, and once to change the temporarily named glyphs to the alt names. (Describing this sequence, it's apparent that it wouldn't be too hard to write a script that does it all in one run, but I have other things I'm supposed to be working on. Even so, it should still be faster than doing it manually.)

As for the class kerning, I'll assume you've created the kerning classes in FontLab's class panel. You could export your classes as a text file, do a round of search and replaces in a text editor (similar to the steps I described with the script), and then import the classes, replacing the existing ones. Note: the kerning will stay with the original glyphs, even when you rename them. Once you've done all this, rebuild the kern feature. There's probably an easier way to do this, but I've done it this way and it works.

Here's the script:

<pre>from robofab.world import CurrentFont, CurrentGlyph

f = CurrentFont()

tString = "a b c" # put your 'before' glyph list here
listOne = tString.split(" ")

tString = "a.1 b.1 c.1" # put your 'after' glyph list here
listTwo = tString.split(" ")

i = 0
while i < len(listOne):
	g = f[listOne[i]]
	g.name = listTwo[i]
	g.update()
	g.autoUnicodes()
	g.update()
	i = i+1
		
fl.UpdateFont()

print "All done."</pre></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wonderful Mark! Many thanks. I've installed Robofab earlier, but haven't got the time to learn how to use it. This certainly gives good motivation to it. 

Just one thing: what should be defined to listThree? Should there be a line that counts the number of items in the two other lists and puts that into listThree? Or did I misunderstood something? Also, I tried to make a lists of 19 glyphs, but FL macro window crops the end of the lines. That's no problem really, I can run the script in several passes. 

It did cross my mind to TextWrangle the kerning (it's all in the OT kern feature), but it is still a lot of work. Can't python access that data in the same way it changes the names and unicodes?</div>

else:

		<div class="commentbody">listThree? I don't see that. In an earlier version I posted it may have been in there (that was the name I previously used instead of "listTemp"). "listTemp" is a copy of "listOne" with ".temp" appended to the glyph names. It's necessary to assign these temporary names to the first set of glyphs before assigning the first list names to the glyphs in the second list. Once that's done, then it's safe to assign the names from the second list to the glyphs in the first list. You can't just sort of say a=A and A=a or you end up with both having the same names (wich won't work anyway).

It's up to you to make sure the two lists have the same number of items. (Presumably, you are swapping pairs of glyphs; one list has the first member of the pair, the other list has the other. So they should number the same.) Edit: I rewrote it to include code to check that the lists are the same length. It will tell you if they are not.

Also, it is possible to put way more than 19 glyphs in the lists. You can make the macro window wider, and you can scroll to the right. (I have run into a limit before, but it was way higher than 19.)

It's probably possible to access the OT features and class data with a script, but I haven't investigated that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great! The script works now and it switches the glyphs like it should. I did also manage to build up longer lists. I'm not sure if the code swaps the unicodes like it should. The .alt glyphs in my font don't have unicode values at all. After running the script, the both switched glyphs have the same unicode value. If I understand your script correctly, it actually switches the names of the glyphs, and then based on that name, it adds a unicode value. Could these unnecessary unicodes result from the autoUnicode function? 

Maybe after I study Python a bit more, I can find out about accessing the OT features and class data. Considering also about starting a new thread for that :)

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. The "autoUnicodes" method should remove the unicode value if there isn't one that corresponds to the glyph name.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Maybe clearing the unicode values before running autoUnicodes would ensure that existing values don't persist.

Here's a short script that swaps names and unicodes for any two selected glyphs in the font window:

<pre>#FLM: Swap Glyphs
"""Swaps two selected glyphs."""

f = fl.font
fIdx = fl.ifont

selGlyphs = [ f.glyphs[gIdx] for gIdx in range( len(f.glyphs) ) if fl.Selected(gIdx) ]
if len(selGlyphs) == 2:
  selGlyphs[0].name, selGlyphs[1].name = selGlyphs[1].name, selGlyphs[0].name
  selGlyphs[0].unicodes, selGlyphs[1].unicodes = selGlyphs[1].unicodes, selGlyphs[0].unicodes
  fl.UpdateFont(fIdx)
</pre>

And yes, it is possible to access classes and features through python via <code>fl.font.classes</code> and <code>fl.font.features</code>, but those require further parsing to manipulate the data. It'd be nice to have a python method similar to the "Rename Glyph" tool in the Glyph menu, but that functionality seems to be absent from the python API.</div>

Been looking for something like this for a long time. And it works like a charm on FL 5.04.

However on the new 5.1 I get an error saying can't find robofub.world or something.

Have any idea why that is?

		<div class="commentbody">I asked about it on the RoboFab group ( http://groups.google.com/group/robofab ) and Tal Leming responded:

<blockquote>Yes, with a caveat. The dialogs provided with robofab.interface.all.dialogs are misbehaving/not working in Mac OS 10.7. We're actively trying to resolve that but making a single API for all of the various OS, OS version and application combinations is frustrating. Other than that it works as far as we know. 

You'll need to install RoboFab from source. To do this you need to figure out which Python FontLab is using. I'd tell you which it is, but it changes frequently and I'm not 100% sure where things stand at the moment. To figure out the Python version, run this in the macro panel: 

<code>import sys 
print sys.version</code> 

Once you have this report, you can figure out which Terminal command you need. If you see 2.5, your command will be python2.5. If you see 2.6 and you are running OS 10.6, your command will be python. If you see 2.6 and you are running OS 10.7, your command will probably be python2.6 (I'm not running OS 10.7, so I'm guessing here). If you see 2.7, you are almost certainly running OS 10.7 (otherwise you really messed up your system) and your command will be python. 

Now follow these steps, replacing yourpythoncommand with your Python command as defined above. 

1. If you don't have it already, get the "RoboFab + FontTools + DialogKit Combo" zip here: http://robofab.com/download/index.html 
2. Unpack the zip and put it in a location where you want the files to live. For example <code>/Applications/RoboFab</code>. 
3. Open Terminal. 
4. Type "<code>cd </code>" (the space is required) and drag the FontTools folder to the Terminal window. This should give you something like "<code>cd /Applications/RoboFab/FontTools</code>". Hit return. 
5. Type "<code>sudo yourpythoncommand setup.py install</code>". Hit return. 
6. A bunch of installation notes should appear. 
7. Type "<code>sudo yourpythoncommand </code>" (the space is required) and drag the install.py file in the RoboFab directory to the Terminal window. Hit return. 
8. "<code>Robofab is now installed.</code>" should appear along with some other text. 
9. Type "<code>sudo yourpythoncommand </code>" (the space is required) and drag the install.py file in the DialogKit directory to the Terminal window. Hit return. 
10. "<code>dialogKit is now installed.</code>" should appear along with some other text. 
11. Restart FontLab if you have it open. 

Hopefully this will work. We'll likely try to make this easier when the dust settles.</blockquote>

This worked for me using MacOS 10.6 and FL 5.1. Scripts run noticeably faster, too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Many thanks to you too, gargoyle! But wait a second, doesn't the "Rename Glyph" -tool actually rename _ALL_ references to the glyphs including classes, kerning, opentype features? I could go one by one renaming my glyphs like this: S -> S.temp, S.alt -> S, S.temp -> S.alt. Shouldn't this do the job right? Ok, I have something like 40 glyphs per weight to switch but I could totally skip the TextWrangler. Now how come I never thought of the Rename Glyph -tool before. Duh!

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the duplicate Unicode values when swapping with .alt or other non-coded glyphs— apparently Robofab’s <code>autoUnicodes</code> method doesn’t remove the value unless it finds a new one to substitute. Adding <code>g.unicodes = []</code> above <code>g.autoUnicodes()</code> will prevent coded glyphs from keeping their old values after swapping names with non-coded glyphs.

As an exercise of my limited scripting abilities, I tried to extend my “Swap Two Selected Glyphs” macro to mimic Mark’s “Swap Lists of Glyphs”. This version is FontLab-only and does not require Robofab.

<pre>
#FLM: Swap Two Glyph Lists
"""Swaps two sets of glyphs."""
# (based on Mark Simonson's "Swap List of Glyphs")

f = fl.font

listOne = "a b c" # <- put your first glyph list here
listTwo = "A B C" # <- put your second glyph list here

listOne, listTwo = listOne.split(" "), listTwo.split(" ")

if len(listOne) == len(listTwo):
	for i in range( len(listOne) ):
		g1 = f.glyphs[ f.FindGlyph( listOne[i] ) ]
		g2 = f.glyphs[ f.FindGlyph( listTwo[i] ) ]
		fl.SetUndo(g1.index)
		fl.SetUndo(g2.index)
		g1.name, g2.name = g2.name, g1.name
		g1.unicodes, g2.unicodes = g2.unicodes, g1.unicodes
	fl.UpdateFont()
	print 'Done! %d pairs of glyphs swapped.' % len(listOne)
else:
	print "Can't run. Lists are not equal."

That's clever--I didn't realize that kind of statement worked in that way. Could have saved all that nonsense with "listTemp" in my version.</div>
