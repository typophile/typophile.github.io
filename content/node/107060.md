  body: Can't find a perfect match for this one. Actually, pretty convinced this would
    more likely be a custom job based on some (Gothic?) Condensed Sans. I guess it
    would be not so hard to reproduce it starting with something like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/libel-suit|Libel
    Suit]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/tempus-gothic|Tempus Gothic]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/korolev|Korolev]]
    Compressed or [[http://www.dafont.com/rachel.font|Rachel]] (pulling upward /N
    crossbar connection, adding median spurs/thorns and adding outline strokes to
    the whole thing).
