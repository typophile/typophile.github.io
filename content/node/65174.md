    a jerk, you just do this way too frequently. This board is for announcing when
    fonts are actually released and you clearly already have a blog. '

  body: "Actually, this board is styled as being for \"Licensing, royalties, and the
    fine art of self-promotion\".  I'm sure previews of imminent releases fit into
    the latter category somehow Jackson-by all means don't read them if you're not
    interested.  I always make sure to lable a preview clearly.\r\n\r\nThat saaid
    (and also not trying to be a 'jerk')  Lowndes is now released [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/lowndes/
    |  here on Myfonts.com]].  Glad you like it Charles.\r\n\r\n"
