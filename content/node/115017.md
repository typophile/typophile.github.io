  body text to go with Trio Grotesk?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.boldmonday.com/en/triogrotesk/\r\n\r\nI'd
  like something contemporary to go along with it.  I'm doing a site re-do for a friend
  who's got it and also has a subscription to Typekit, so if any suggestions would
  be on there, that would be fantastic, but it's by no means a requirement.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help or guidance you can give me.\r\n\r\n\r\nAaron"
