		<div class="commentbody">I did some searching for the numerals and found nothing that I thought would be close enough for your project, if you really want to replicate the lettering. Huxley Vertical was quite similar, but not identical. The 4 was open and the 8 was more symmetrical. Agency Gothic is too angular. Raleigh Gothic is also fairly close, but the 1 has serifs, and at least the metal type version was heavier weight. Eden Light was a serif typeface, but its numerals show few serifs, and might be a possibility for you. Eden has been digitized, as have the others I mentioned. Maybe with a bit of tweaking you could make one of these work.

The basic sans lettering should be fairly easy to replicate, so i didn't focus on that one.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Mike! You really looked into this and I appreciate your help. I think Eden Light is the way to go, unless something else comes along that looks better. Shouldn't take too much tweaking to get it right. 

I agree about the sans lettering. Most of it looks to be Futura Bold (with the possible exception of the words at the very top). 

If you're interested, you can follow my progress on this project on Dribbble:
