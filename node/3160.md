  body: The top one is Alternate Gothic &#40;No. 1, I think&#41;, slanted. <BR> <BR>The
    other one looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/lh-extended/testdrive.html?s=NEW&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Trade Gothic Extended</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/lh-bold-extended/testdrive.html?s=ORDER&amp;p=48"

  body: Hmm. Not so sure about the first one now. It could be No. 2 or No. 3 condensed

  body: Hmm, apparently the bottom is &#34;Chisel Wide&#34;, and the top is &#34;Eng
    Gothic Italic&#34;, I&#39;ve never heard of these fonts before, though, so yeah,
    I&#39;ll go with the ones you posted, thanks.
