  body: The first one looks like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue/?testdrive=src%3Dcustom%26text%3DRODIN%26size%3D81%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3DFFFFFF%26w%3D720%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26dock%3Dfalse%26seed%3D28">Helvetica
    Thin</a>. The second one may be hand lettered. The two s's don't quite match.
