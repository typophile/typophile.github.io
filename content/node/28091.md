body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm designing some packaging for a product that is to be sold
  in China (specifically Shanghai) and the US. All the text is in English (mostly
  using ChaletComprime), except for one panel, which needs to be in Chinese. \r\n\r\nI
  need a Chinese font that reads well at a small size. I am using Illustrator CS and
  am in OS 10.4.7. Does any one have any suggestions for fonts (whether system installed
  or for sale)? Also any recommendations/guidelines about setting text in Chinese?
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
