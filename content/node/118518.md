    Grotesk Condensed but as you can see \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CondGothicTypophile118518AsAkzidenzGroteskCond_5268.jpg]
    it's not condensed enough. try compressing the width to 90%.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CondGothicTypophile118518AsAkzidenzGroteskCondWidth90Pct_4328.jpg]\r\nCloser
    but still not an exact match. Note for example the tail on _t_."

    the width of Folio Extra Condense to 95% and you get [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CondGothicTypophile118518AsFolioWidth95Pct_5013.jpg]\r\nPretty
    much a match, taking into consideration the light on dark vs dark on light issues
    I mentioned in a recent post on another ID request.\r\nIf there is a closer match,
    it seems to me that it is hardly worth digging for it.\r\nAs far as I am concerned,
    Kevin deserves congratulations for finding a match in Folio Extra Condensed.\r\nDon"
