  but i haven't the slightest clue as to what it was called. Is there a list or a
  way i can see previously featured faces? Thanks again! =]

    Typophile. If you can give me an idea of what it was you saw, I might be able
    to give you the name.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a great idea moving forward,
    that we compile a visual list of everything we use."
