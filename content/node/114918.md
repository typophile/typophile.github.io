  R on this 1916 book cover. Has anyone seen a digital match?\r\nI assume this is
  lettering, but here are the book details anyway Robert Bartlett & Ralph Hale _The
  Last Voyage of the Karluk Flagship of Vilhjalmar Stefansson's Canadian Arctic Expedition
  of 1913-16_, Boston Small, Maynard and Company, 1916, 1st US Edition\r\nDon"

  body: Can't remember where I see such a /R... Anyway, for the serif, I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson|Ronaldson]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cercurius/fitzronald|Fitzronald]].

  body: "Hi Ryuk, I also like the two Ronaldson based types as good similars to the
    serif.  I have admired the Canada Type version since it was first published. Some
    tinkering, such the addition of a Cheltenham style spur on the G would make it
    even closer.\r\nPerhaps someone else has seen a digital font with the an italic
    R with a similar swoosh shaped leg?\r\nDon"
