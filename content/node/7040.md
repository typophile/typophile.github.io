  body: It&#39;s not what I&#39;d call an improvement. I expected much more from FontLab...
    after all, why change if you don&#39;t get something better? <BR> <BR>Rebranding
    is pretty costly, and my first advice to my clients is always &#34;Don&#39;t change!!!&#34;
    &#40;unless it&#39;s really necessary&#41;. <BR> <BR>Marius

  body: Well, their old logo was reminiscent of FontShop&#39;s FontFont logo, so that
    might have been reason enough to change

  body: To me it&#39;s an ordinary solution, expectable and not very smart. <BR>However,
    I do not like neither the script font or the sans font they used for &#34;Lab&#34;...
    <BR>It&#39;s not tricky to make a good logo. And I think they could get a better
    one -- just launch a contest on this forum or other... a lot of type enthusiasts
    would get in &#40;I presume&#41;. Solutions can be found--you know, where&#39;s
    a will, there&#39;s a way. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
