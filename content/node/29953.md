body: "Does anyone know of a version of Century that has small-caps and old-style-figures?\r\n\r\nI
  currently favour ITC as it has a large family and a strong italic, but New/Schoolbook
  and Oldstyle have their merits.\r\n\r\nIf any of them had an expert set, I'd select
  it as a standard in a second.\r\n\r\nIf not, does anyone know of a font like Century
  (ITC pref.) that does have SC+OSF?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    Frutiger used Century as his inspiration, and it is functionally very similar.
    It also has a full compliment of small caps and oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\nAs far
    as I know, though, it does not have a full set of ordinals, fractions, extended
    ligatures or other elements common to \"expert\" sets. Still, it's more functional
    for professional typography than any cut of Century of which I'm aware.\r\n\r\nDavid

  body: "Miller from Font Bureau is my favorite \"Century.\"* It has small caps and
    hybrid figures -- 3/4 height numbers with a tiny bit of ascension/descension.\r\n\r\n*I
    know, strictly speaking, it's not a Century. But I see enough similarities to
    suggest it, especially if Century Oldstyle is an option, which seems further away
    from the idea of Century-ness (as embodied by Expanded or even ITC) than Miller."

  body: "I agree about Miller. The US version of GQ uses it as their text face in
    a lot of articles, and used to use it as a display face a few years ago before
    switching to Titling Gothic.\r\n\r\nVSA Partners also used it in the beautiful
    Strathmore collateral for Mohaw paper this year, especially in the \"hello\" book."
