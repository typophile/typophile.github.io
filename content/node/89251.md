    I think then that's what I'll have to do as we do not own Proxima Nova."

  body: "So many font finders these days!\r\n\r\nWhatTheFont didn't get it right.\r\n\r\nI
    like What Font Is for asking questions about the font...\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I
    just read that WhatTheFont has been incorporated into Firefox/other browsers to
    allow you to simply right-click on an image that's on the web to identify it (or
    something simply like that). Sounds kind of cool.\r\n\r\n"
