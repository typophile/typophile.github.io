body: "Hi all, I'm partly redesigning a historical periodical. A friend suggested
  Tankard's [[http://www.typography.net/type/font/kingfisher|Kingfisher]] for body
  text. In my opinion a great \u2013 conservative but fresh \u2013 original design.
  But is has no true small caps, which I really need \u2013 and will be using a lot.
  To automate small caps by using a character style is not an option.\r\n\r\nSo any
  suggestions would be more than welcome.\r\nThanks in advance, Brieck. "

    did with Kingfisher and never looked at the samples, just at the styles. '

    I prefer using good old Corel Ventura for these jobs. But Ventura doesn't support
    OpenType features \u2013 which is surprising for such a typographically savvy
    program.\r\n \r\nSo any suggestions would still be more than welcome. Thanks,

    with the small capitals in standard lowercase glyph positions.\r\n\r\nIn terms
    of alternatives, tell us more about what you appreciate about Kingfisher and what
    you'd be looking for in an alternative. How close does it need to be to Kingfisher?
    Can you say more about the periodical this is for?\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    the next few years, which would be my choice.\r\nAs for alternatives; I like the
    italics, almost a slanted roman. Also the osf figures, I think, come out very
    well. The few pages I received and printed just made a fresh impression and looked
    quite elegant.\r\nAs to the periodical; the main focus lies on Dutch imperial
    and colonial history.\r\n\r\nThanks, Brieck"

    at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_seria_regular/\">Seria</a>,

  body: "Well, John, I was sort of fishing to see if Whitman might fit the bill ;-)
    But it's not really that much like Kingfisher, and I'm not sure it would be as
    fitting for Brieck's topic.\r\n\r\nBut, Brieck, if you want to consider it, you
    can find more Whitman samples at my website also: www.kentlew.com.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'd be happy to set up some more specific samples with your column specs and some
    text you provide, if you want to contact me directly off-forum.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"
