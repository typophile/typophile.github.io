  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am working on a created with Indesign CS4. The book is finished, and in the process of getting it out the door, we have noticed two places where changes we made reverted to their old versions, in one case the version it reverted to was weeks old. I know that this is not just my memory playing tricks on me because we confirmed it by going back and looking at printouts, and the printouts were fine, but at some point the content changed even though nobody was working on those pages. 

Has anyone else seen this happening?</div>

I have been bitten by InDesign's undo feature, which affects things on pages that one isn't looking at, and can result in unseen reversions if one is not careful. But a reversion to something weeks-old would not be explained by that.</div>

might be a situation with bridge and if there are multiple files on the drive named 'document.indd', revisions and edits and whatnot ... if there's an application error and it has to recover or start again at what it thinks is the correct version of 'document.indd' that it pulls from the wrong place, you can have those things jump up and bite you. especially since the last few edits on anything are small punctuation changes, a factchecking clarification or subtle design adjustments. 

i'd recommend taking on a naming convention where you have the day's date at the end. 'document102009.indd' so if you have to recover or compare it, you don't have to go on an archaeological expedition to see the differences.

In the spirit of unbridled creativity,

Just FYI, that's not a bug -- it's documented. The line breaking algorithm is revised for CS4, as the older versions (at least going back to CS) tended to kick out the last single word or syllable, leaving this more often on a last line than statistically likely.

The new line breaking routines are only applied to stories that are actually edited in CS4; if you don't edit something, it'll remain the same (and if you <em>do</em> edit something, the line breaks will be better!).

Whenever and whereever possible, I refrain from upgrading software across documents.</div>
