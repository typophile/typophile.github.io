body: "Please help!\r\nI'm designing my business cards for my psychotherapy practice.\r\nI'm
  looking for a font that will look good in 8pt to 11pt, in both caps and lowercase.\r\nI'd
  like a font that is contemporary but also has a solid and classic feel to it. \r\nI
  also need the font to go well with the Pristina font, as one line in my logo uses
  that font.\r\n\r\nI was going to use Barbedor, but I'm not loving it because the
  capital \"i\" resembles the number \"1\" to my eye, and I don't think Barbedor works
  well with Pristina.\r\n\r\nMany, many thanks!"
