I am in the process of creating a business card for myself. I would like to do it on clear plastic like Mike Haska did in a previous post. <BR> <BR>The blue area is going to be clear. This will allow the white border/stroke around the 'eh' to stand out and the white stripe at the bottom to also stand out. <BR> <BR>I am going to print the white stripe at the bottom on the back of the card to give it some depth. I would like to do the same the same for the white around 'eh' but am unsure if that would look ok since it would be on the back. <BR> <BR>I would be greatly appreciative any comments on my design - layout, design, fonts, etc. Say anything and it will be taken in consideration&hellip;  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help in advance - Troy <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/62922.jpg" alt="Business Card"></div>

If you do use them, they should only be between items and evenly spaced.</div>

I am going to play with it a bit tonight and when I get changed I will post it again. <BR> <BR>As for the Computer sales I am getting into that on the side with a frind of mine I think I will remove that since that is not a major part of the business.  <BR> <BR>As for the eh chomping into the leaf I am going to make the white border around it a bit smaller but I have been using this logo as it is for awhile now. <BR> <BR>Good thought about the hyphens and the . after Ave.  <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the suggestions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Troy, <BR> <BR>Just a note on material type. Even though I started off with the intent of going with a plastic card, I eventually decided to go with a translucent paper. My main reasons for the switch were to facilitate a faster printing time, to reduce costs, and because I wasn't 100% comfortable with completely clear cards. <BR> <BR>My concern was that in a business card folder or a stack of cards, my card might 'disappear' when the the card behind it shows through. I was a little worried that my card would be too much like a chameleon, blending in with the background&hellip; <BR> <BR>Since your card has a large, colourful logo with a white border, this effect might be mitigated, but I can tell you that I've had tonnes of compliments with my translucent cards (I don't think I've suffered because of the switch, in any case.) <BR> <BR>Also, on the design of your card, I would agree with the comments suggesting sizing down the elements to increase the amount of white space. Also, you might try swapping the position of your name/title and your address. I think a more central location on the card would give your name more precidence over the other elements&hellip; <BR> <BR>Can't wait to see the redesign! <BR> <BR>-Mike</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Darrel and Daniel's suggestions, but would also like to see you revise your typeface choices. Your logo face is between a print and a script, in that limbo with Comic Sans. Maybe try using your own handwriting or creating a few custom letters in Illustrator. On the other extreme, the body copy on the right just looks transcribed. Try exaggerating the sizes; you can read down to 7 or 8pt comfortably with quality printing. <BR> <BR>I'd like to see some iterations with more playful placement of the card's elements.</div>
