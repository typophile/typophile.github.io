  body: The "About Bloomberg" text looks a lot like <a href="http://www.linotype.com/12833/avenir85heavy-font.html">Avenir
    85 Heavy</a> to my eyes, but I seem to recall they used to use Avant Garde (and
    <a href="http://www.observer.com/2008/media/david-rhodes-leaves-fox-news-talks-new-gig-bloomberg-tv">here</a>
    is an image of their logo corroborating that). Perhaps they've updated their corporate
    identity a bit - Avant Garde looks very '70s or '80s, and Avenir is more classic.
