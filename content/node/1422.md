  body: Bottom one is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bembo/semibold-italic-oldstyle-figures/testdrive.html?s=It%20was%20a%20slim%20grey%20volume%20entitled&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank"> Bembo</a>, middle one is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/light/testdrive.html?s=TRUE%20LOVE%20NEVER%20GOES%20OUT%20OF%20FASHION&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank"> Futura</a>, top one  <BR>looks Garamond-ish but I&#39;ll have
    to check that.

  body: Yeah, I was looking at that one right now, because  <BR>Adobe&#39;s hasn&#39;t
    got little serif-thingie at the bottom  <BR>right of the G. I think <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/jenson-classico/small-caps/testdrive.html?s=E%20l%20e%20g%20a%20n%20c%20e&amp;p=72"

  body: PS when you copy-paste the URL of a Testdrive, be sure  <BR>to remove the
    plusses that MyFonts has substituted  <BR>for the spaces. Click both our links,
    compare the end  <BR>results and you&#39;ll see what I mean.

  body: That&#39;s alright. I assumed that they would convert to spaces automatically.
    <BR>A more standards-compliant alternative would be replacing them with %20 :D
