<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've got a problem. I just downlaoded the gorgeous "Musee" by DSType, which comes in OpenType and TrueType flavours.
I'm using MS Office 2004 for Mac. The problem is that although the weights contain the special swashes, ligatures and other goodies I love, I have no access to them when I select "insert symbol." Seems a generic character map shows up. Same thing for the TrueType flavour.
How can I access these special sets through Word 2004 for Mac?
</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">

You should be able to access some of the basic symbols and ligatures using the keboard viewer.</div>

I'd say, write to MS but c/o the Word and/or Office team(s). AFAIK, they're the ones that don't give a penny to the good work the MS Typography team and other font developers are doing...
> <em>isn’t there any solution? How do I access the keyboard viewer?</em>
I believe Adobe was trying to overcome this problem when they decided to use [[PUA]]'s in their fonts*. I don't think you'll be able to get any character into Word unless it has an [[Unicode]] value associated with it.
> <em>Or zhould I be using something other than Word for my Word Processing/design needs? Maybe InDesign?</em>
That's one option. I believe there are other out there. It will depend on the kind of work you do and how you need to output it. A simple word processing application is fine for office-like documents, but not for heavy-graphical documents that need to be offset printed.
> <em>I’m really disappointed.</em>
(As sorry as I am to have to say this in mid-2006,) Welcome to the <em>real</em> (type) world !! :^/
I completely understand your grief.

Mac Office is actually a separate group with Microsoft, and deserve a bit more slack than the Windows Office group on the subject of OpenType Layout support because they have not had the system infrastructure sitting at their fingertips for years.
If I were a betting man, I might put money on Mac Office delivering OTL typography support before Windows Office at the current rates of non-motion from the latter.</div>

Check out <a href=http://www.redlers.com/>Mellel</a>. To be honest, I don't know how good their OTL support for Latin script typography is, but I've been impressed by their complex script support. You could also look around for any Mac apps that make use of IBM's ICU library, which provides open source support for OpenType Layout.</div>

AFAIK, OTL typography support for non-Latin scripts is available in Windows Office, correct? If so, wouldn't Latin OTL support come for free? If so, what I fail to understand is why isn't that in place already.</div>

The OTL features implemented in Windows Office are all language shaping features, i.e. features that are active by default for the script and are not considered discretionary. Such features are also implemented for the Latin script, e.g. the ccmp and mark positioning features. What Office do not support, for any script, are features that require user interface.</div>

First, there is the problem of user interface. The linguistic OTL features usually are supposed to "just work" while for user-controlled OTL features you need decent UI. If you look at Adobe's inconsistent solutions between Illustrator (OpenType, Character and Glyph palettes), InDesign (Character and Glyph palette but no OpenType palette), and Photoshop (only Character palette), you'll realize that it's not at all trivial.
Second, there is the issue of backwards-compatibility in line-breaking. For Arabic or Indic scripts, there was constant improvement across Office versions (97, 2000, XP, 2003, 2007) which, however, often resulted in text reflow when you open the same document in different editors. In this case, the advantage of having ortographically more correct handling of the scripts was valued higher than the disadvantage of reflow.
But for simple scripts, the Office team aimed for consistent line- and page-breaks in Word across versions. If at some point, you get ligatures and different kerning (GPOS-sourced class kerning vs. traditional plain kerning which usually is a subset of the earlier), your documents will certainly reflow. Apparently, the advantage of having typographic refinement has not yet outweighed the reflow risk in the Microsoft Office team members' heads.

<div class=commentbody> . . . which leads me to ask why Dino dos Santos would create such a beautiful legible, feature-rich font set, only to package it in a manner which would frustrate most users?
Make no mistake: far be it frome me to criticize such a talented designer - I'm grateful beyond words that Musee was released publicly - but how is one supposed to access all the glyphs? Why not simply include the extra problem-causing ligatures and the like in a separate OpenType file? Or was dos Santos thinking only of InDesign users, or perhaps *future* users down the road, when OT technology matures sufficiently?</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Or was dos Santos thinking only of InDesign users, or perhaps *future* users down the road, when OT technology matures sufficiently?</em>
Probably. This seems to be more or less an industry-standard for new fonts. I have a feeling (and I'm sorry that this is no consolation for you) that most font users who specifically want to set advanced typographic features do their typesetting virtually soley in Quark, InDesign, or Illustrator.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's definitely NOT Dino's fault. The decision-makers behind MS Office are the ones that do not seem to be willing to allow their users to make "good typography".
Let's face it, what can you expect from a word-processing application that does not have kerning ON by default?!? Well, maybe they're right and we're ones wrong here. Maybe you need to stick to a layout application instead...

<div class=commentbody>Miguel, I think Bill Gates must have had a childhood rival named Kerning who teased Bill to tears and would never shut up. Bill was looking for a way to turn Kerning OFF since then so it's not default of the word process, it's default of the ab-user :-)

<div class=commentbody>Christian,
"Word Processing/design needs"
is an oxymoron. Do your word processing in Word, since it's made (ostensibly) for that, then, when that's done, take the plain text and format it in InDesign, Quark, Illustrator, or some other software that's made to handle OpenType. If you need typographic features available while you type, then just use InDesign or Quark. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm sitting in front of my mac, laughing out loud! Ahh, a bit of levity always helps.
Mellel turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Kerning seems to be on by default, it has automatic ligatures - dicretionary and others, auto swashes, historical forms/ligatures, auto small caps, you name it. It recognizes *most* of Musee's OT features, not all (i.e., a number of swashes), but until I get InDesign this will do very nicely. A great value at around 40-50 bucks, too. Well worth checking out.
Another one that more or less did justice to Musee's beauty is Nisus Writer Express. I'm not sure about its kerning capabilities, though, seemed a bit shaky to me.
In any case, Mellel is far better than MS Office when it comes to taking advantage of OT features such as are in Musee. </div>

Thanks for the help, but there's no need. Mellel has auto-opentype features. I can "ligaturize" a whole block of text by selecting it and simply acticvating ligatures from the appropriate menu. Same goes for small caps, swashes and the like. I'll be picking up a copy of InDesign as well, and that does what Mellel does, and *much* more besides.
Finally, I can use OpenType fonts the way they were intended.</div>
