Can anyone suggest any others. Either along the same lines or not?

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure if there really is an age issue when it comes to type preferences. People assume something 'fun' would appeal to kids, but if it's hard to read, no one will like it, regardless of the age. And 'fun' fonts can appeal to anyone of any age.

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps you should look at the best selling children's books in the genre you're working on. My guess is that you'll find a diverse set of type choices and some hand lettering too - I don't think you'll find too much stereotypical "kid-type" in the best books - in my experience children like to be taken seriously.

<div class=commentbody>> You’re confusing marketing with design.
No, we're just using the terms in different ways.
My point was that Design is about the user, not us.
BTW, one thing virtually all children under about 10 share is the strong preference for reading deliberatively, not immersively (see Watts & Nisbett). One thing this means for example is that serifs are not functional to them (although any formal feature can still be evocative).

As the oldest of eight and a grandfather of ten, I can attest to the truth of this observation. Kids hate to be "treated like kids." Any decent typeface with a large x-height and rounded (vs. angular) letterforms will work for text and captions, but have fun with the headlines.</div>

<div class=commentbody>'Children's books' always do have two target groups (if you assume that you have to design for 'target groups'): the children themselves and the adults who buy them for them, read them out for them - literary scientists call that 'double adressing'. Plus you have to think that there are special interest media and institutions on children's literature that do recommendations (also painting with a large brush: they mainly use categories like age) etc.
So I think the goal is to achieve high typographical quality for all possible readers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stephen...what makes those 'kids fonts' moreso than 'adult' fonts?
I think the comment on 'look at the content' is the better indicator of the type choices to make.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sassoon as characters looks great. It's the typeface used by Postman Pat! But it kerned horribly for me (was using quark, if that matters.)
For "educational" type: check out this to-the-point list:
http://www.educationalfontware.com/EFI_home_page.html
Some of these (HB, Palmer) contain versions that even have the ruled guides.
Before making a final choice, you should check children's book characters such as Pooh, Dora, Elmo, Barney, etc etc to see what type they use, because what they use, they use often, and it becomes an association with that character. (I think Elmo used Providence at one point, but I couldn't find an example. Thing is, they usually switch "official" typefaces every few years anyways.)

<div class=commentbody>Brian, did you kern with versions of Sassoon that you got from Linotype? I think that there were earlier versions distributed through other channels. I'd like to know.

any other links that may have info associated with learning letterforms (pre-literacy)?
meaning, pre-literate children, and learning to identify letterforms, and if there are suggested typeface that team this?
it looks like ther eis really little or no research to support the use of one font over another to teach reading or for that matter letter identification</div>

The simpler the letterform, the better, because the simple letterforms convey the "essence" of each letterform more clearly.</div>

<div class=commentbody>simpler....ok.
what is this supposed to mean? there are many "simple" fonts. every school district in the universe has different "simple fonts" and standards for teaching this stuff. I am trying to see if there are some objective facts out there regarding teaching pre-literate kids (3-5 yr olds) the good ol' A-B-Cs. Sasson seems to get a lot of talk (it meets a lot of criteria for teaching children), and it is a lovely font. However, after reading a few articles out on the web some folks propose MS comic sans as a the best solution for teaching these kids as it is soft and freindly and replicates to degree handwriting. (I hate comic sans, gag). in the end i am looking for some facts. the kidstype.org site is great i would really like to see more of their study (they talk about comic sans too)

<div class=commentbody>letter identification first (this is looking into the first exposure of kids to type), then on to reading and writing. we are talking about the basis of reading. kids will eventually get vast amounts of exposure to type of all sorts. but as a foundational experience with type I am trying to find research that supports a certain font.</div>

Well, sure. But 'fun and playful' != kids. It's an attribute kids can have, or one adults can have.
What I cringe at is the 'oh, it's for kids? Use something FUN like comic sans!' type of reaction that is all too common. </div>

<div class=commentbody>This is a realy interesting thread. I'm probably ot going to be answering Marc's question either (sorry Mark).
I have been using sassoon for kids multimedia. I wanted to know about peoples thoughts on the essentials too:
x-height, point size, relative weight etc.
Also, more about actually setting the type, kerning, leading etc.
I guess the key really is maximum ledgibility. We have been using voice over for everything and supporting that with text on screen.
We have three point sizes for three age ranges:
prep/foundation: 30pt sasoon sans
grade 1-2: 26pt sasoon sans
grade 3-4: 22pt sasoon sans
grade 4-5: 18pt sasoon sans
These also had various kerning and leading setting.
We tried out some stuff and instinctively went for quite a bit of leading, up to 6pts for the younger kids.
There was a fair amount of discussion about ambiguity of letters in various fonts: a preference for a straight tail on the nine(sorry about the terminoloy...), as opposed to the upside down 6 was a good example of this. We looked at heaps of fun fonts, but for the younger kids, didn't have enough differntiation between characters like 9.
A capital I with ligatures was also necessary.
mrfussy, yes, totally agree with your comment, "letter identification first" I guess even if you're not setting out to teach reading or writing, then it will still probably go a long way if what you're doing can do that as well.
I think also that what is said on "kidstype.com" is a really important, in terms of what we were doing:
# Teacher opinion, generally, favours sans serif typefaces because of the simplicity of the letter shapes
# But children encounter a wide range of letterforms in their day-to-day environment
# Publishers tend to listen to teachers because they influence the book-buying policy in schools
# Children are seldom asked what they think about the typefaces in the books they read
I may have answered my own question here, but wanted other peoples feedback. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Sassoon: a problem I see is its slant - pretty, but bad for onscreen setting.
> a preference for a straight tail on the nine(sorry about
> the terminoloy…), as opposed to the upside down 6
Yes, this sort of thing is critically important. But one has to overcome the general tendency for Modernist stylistic consistency to rise to that level.
> Children are seldom asked
Neither are adults! :-(
And when they <strong>are</strong> asked, it's all taken too
literally - the proper "filtering" is never done.

<div class=commentbody>We are not actually using primary, which is slanted. We use Sassoon Sans and Sassoon Sans Bold, so slantiness wasn't an issue for us.
We also recut it with some of the alts that were provided.
The w seems to do weird things if you don't anti-alias it too.
The manual that comes with the font touches on some really good points about how to choose the font and some pointers for how to set it too.</div>
