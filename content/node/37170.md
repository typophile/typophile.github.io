body: When did it first become possible to scale the same fonts used on the page for
  use in large signs, billboards, etc.? What was the technology behind it? What I
  am trying to find out is if this was done with photo lettering, or if specialized
  letters and/or lettering systems were used until the ability to just blow up any
  text font digitally came along.

    techniques including grid scaling and maybe pantographs, either directly on to
    a surface to be hand-painted, or on to a large paper to be pounce transferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese
    days all that stuff is done with plotter-cut vinyl or grand-format printers, though
    for certain special circumstances hand-painting is still used."

    of these episcopes predate electricity, so I would suspect people have been scaling
    text for a long time. When I was a kid I used to make posters with an opaque projector
    in my elementary school. I'm sure I traced text as well as images. "

  body: "If this helps, I began working in Graphics in a silk screen printing shop
    in the early '80s. Or main clients were dispaly comapanies, making exhibits for
    trade shows, Museums, Film companies (props) and ad agencies\r\n\r\nWe would get
    artwork from the clients, from which we'd spec type and order it from a typesetting
    company. They could only go so large by that route. I guess 72 points or so. Not
    sure what the max size was... Body copy would be well within that range, but not
    headers and titles. Beyond 72 points, could either be shot in a stat camera (You
    need a film pos for Screen printing anyways) or (more often, because it made for
    a faster turn around time) enlarged with a projector on the wall, using the designer's
    comp, and often, setting the text ourselves using Lettraset. Once traced to size
    we'd straightened it up on a drafting table or on the wall, and the hand-cut the
    text in amberlith, from which we could burn the stencil. \r\n\r\nWe also cut vinyl
    lettering for one-offs the same way. I have gone as large as 15' tall letters
    (the logo and name of Commodore 64,) on a banner installed on the top of the CN
    tower, here in Toronto)\r\n\r\nExperienced sign writers, of which there are still
    a few,  just draw the letters from memory. "

  body: In his ATypI talk James Mosely mentioned someone projecting enlarged printed
    pages via lantern during a lecture in the 1800's - I doubt the technology was
    used to scale type for signage purposes (ie tracing the outlines on a wall and
    then filling them in) but it would have been possible.

    times. I\u2019m sure that it happened\u2014people built entire rooms for doing
    paintings that way!\u2014but what\u2019s really important is when it became a
    common practice. What I\u2019m really after is knowing when designers would have
    started blowing up type used elsewhere in a campaign/brand/etc. as a normal part
    of doing business. I think that this is critical to understanding when optical
    weights for very large signage were being developed alongside text fonts, and
    how this all fits into the idea of families built with fonts that will remain
    legible and readable in a variety of circumstances and media."

  body: "\"When did it first become possible to scale the same fonts used on the page
    for use in large signs, billboards, etc.?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I used film for fonts,
    we never scaled them \u2014 we enlarged or reduced. \r\nScaling, in my definition
    does not involve sizing of the contour itself. Font implies that handwork is not
    involved? The same fonts being used for print and billboard happened in James'
    talk, did it? Wow!\r\n\r\nIf you mean fonts, and scale, literally, then Ikarus
    was the first with a specific application I knew of. ' came out in the late 70's.
    The font was identical to those used in print and the app allowed corrective manipulation
    for the angle and distance of the viewer.\r\n\r\n\"specialized letters and/or
    lettering systems were used\"\r\nThe further back you go into large sign painting,
    the more faded it becomes.;) but there were, as you can still see, all kinds of
    fonts made for or by, systematic use. The simplest example is the chamfered style,
    where measurement, marking and painting yielded huge clear letters without a curve,
    or very few, being required (Herald Gothic is a simple example of this, and Ironmonger
    a more complex one at http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/fontname). Highway Gothic
    holds some secrets on this topic as well. \r\n\r\n\"when designers would have
    started blowing up type used elsewhere in a campaign/brand/etc. as a normal part
    of doing business\"\r\nBig Cheap printers in the Late 80's early 90's is when
    that \"normally\" happened. A lot of wealthy companies did it before that, i.e.
    large format billboard printing, though specialty companies who did small runs
    of large pages from plates. I think Coca-Cola had a terrible quality control problem
    on this, that today looks \"charming\" to us. \r\n\r\n\"when optical weights for
    very large signage were being developed alongside text fonts\"\r\nJust now, I
    mean since the 80's. Before that, the people who made very large signage faces
    were as different from the text folk as a Formula 1 driver is from a potter, even
    though they both got their hands on a wheel. \r\n\r\nI look fwd to reading what
    you get.\r\n\r\ncheers!"
