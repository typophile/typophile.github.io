<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi All,
I´m currently working on a font that i would like to try adding small caps to it. Is there any particular drawing method to create them using the pre-draw capitals? Something like scaling down the capitals and then exterpolate them maybe? Is there any way to optimize this task or do i have to draw them from zero?
As a beginer, any expert help or tips on this would be greatly apreciated.
Thanks in advance
Regards

<div class=commentbody>I would say - but I'm no pro myself - that you can safely use your existing capitals.
There are probably designers that use Multiple Master technology and such to extrapolate the small weight increase that scaled down caps need to work well, but I think you can also use the Bold Filter in FontLab (or the Expand Stroke option in Illustrator) to achive something similar.
Having said that, extrapolations done with these options do need a lot of editing afterwards, because the Expand Stroke/Bold Filter are usually pretty destructive to the lettershapes.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the reply. I see your point, i´m trying to avoid getting to multiple master tools cause i´m still not confortable using them.
But as you said, although the long editing it takes afterwards using the expand stroke/bold filter, perhaps it will take less time than have to draw them from scratch? </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>When I'm making "serviceable" small caps from full caps, I don't scale the full caps proportionally, as recommended by John Hudson -- I usually have about a 4 percentage difference -- if the vertical is scaled to 62 percent, then the horizontal is scaled to 66 percent. This will make you do some work with round letters (C, G, O, Q for sure), but will give a better overall balance.
The weight increase I used in Fontographer was 9 units, but FontLab seems to require less. Don't forget to move them back up to the baseline (half the "embolding" value), and rework the left & right sidebearings. And don't forget to "remove overlap."
That's the start, now clean them up.
P.S. "serviceable" meant I could get away with them in about a 10-point setting, in running text. The most common reason I made them up was to get a set of italic small caps. Sizing there is relatively easy; match existing roman small caps. If you're starting with the roman, size the "new" small cap "x" just a bit taller than the lower-case "x". I let the size change when "embolding," so the final size comparison has to wait till you've done that. Now check things with an "E." If both the "X" and "E" look right, most of the alphabet should feel right, so highlight all & have at it. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>There are two helpers for this:
If your font is MultipleMaster, with a weight axis, try Tim Ahrens' RMX Tuner:
<a href=http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/RMX/>http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/RMX/</a>
This gives the best results that an automatic method can provide today, and should be your first choice.
If the font has a single axis only, you may try the Glyph Tweaker script:
<a href=http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm>http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm</a>
[Scroll down a bit. Requires RoboFab and Dialog Kit.]
First measure basic stem widths and height of your caps. Then run the script and fill in these values, plus stem widths and height of the small caps.
The script relies on FLS' Bold function, so the outlines are only as good as this function allows. If you switch on FontAudit, you will see what I mean. Especially diagonals need corrections -- Bold cares for x and y directions only. Still this is a good starting point to get the proportions. I put these into the uppercase's mask layer and adjust uppercase by moving nodes or with John Hudson's method to match the automatically generated proportions.
In essence, what this script does is combining the operations which Charles Ellertson describes: scaling and bolding. I did not want to calculate scaling and bolding factors myself each time, and put the according formulas into a script.
Charles -- <cite>The weight increase I used in Fontographer was 9 units, but FontLab seems to require less.</cite>
Yes, it is: 2 units FOG Change Weight = 1 unit FLS Bold.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I recently started with John Hudson's method--which he suggests only as a starting point for later adjustments--and have continued to use the FontLab Interpolation tool for curves, as well as widening stems by hand. However, I didn't follow Hudson's model exactly, as I made the small caps a bit wider, as Charles suggests and as I believe is traditional. I don't know how much wider as it just did it by eye. Also I adjusted relative weights of vertical arches, corrected diagonals and joints, etc by eye. I don't know how much adjustment is needed if you use the RMX tuner, but next time around, after I have made my weights MM compatible, I will probably use it as a starting point. </div>

Bill -- <cite>I don’t know how much adjustment is needed if you use the RMX tuner</cite>
Best is to play with it and try different settings until you find some which give a nice result. Whether you make many adjustments or not depends on whether you want the small caps to be more or less like the uppercase (with adjustment of weight and width), or want them to differ in some details. For a Caslon I can imagine that some distinctive features are nice.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bill,
The "4 percent" is just sort of an average I noticed as I was making up small caps over a number of years -- usually in italic, sometimes in roman. As you say, you have to make even these initial decisions by eye -- or at least, I do, and it seems you as well. The scaling values pretty much depend on the lowercase letters; at least, for the small caps that are to set in running text. As I remember, I've used as little as 59 percent with vertical, and probably as much as 75 percent.
For another set of "display" small caps, you have more freedom. If you have, or the library has, Adrian Wilson's <em>The Design of Books</em>, look at the "special two-letter small caps" for Caslon Old Face. In my copy, it is page 39. These sorts were available for just a few fonts in the Linecaster days.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks a lot people for all the tips and links.
After some experiments, a question still and always persists… Using the interpolation method described by John Hudson, or even using the bold effect i still can´t understand how do i get the overall width of the smcp generated glyph proportionally to the uppercase letter. How can this be done? Do i have to calculate the glyph overall width manually and than fill that space afterwards?
Hope I´m making any sense.
How do I calculate the overall glyph width of the small caps proportionally to the capitals is what´s troubling me most, even knowing that the small caps will be wider. Always have to do some math!
Ps. Those missing illustrations probably could help...
Thanks in advance

<div class=commentbody>Bill,
I've never actually held special no. 5 mats in my hand, and Bill Loftin (Heritage Printers) has finally shut down, so I can't ask. But yes, I think that meant they were duplexed mats -- roman and italic on one matrix.
Note the the roman small capitals on these matrices are a bit larger than what you see in the regular font; I imagine they were intended for display. A good supporting argument for Adam's notion that small caps should be a separate font. I'd argue (& for all I know, Adam always felt this way) that this idea works when the small caps are for display, but another set of small capitals should be included in the basic fonts for running text.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have thought of doing the display small caps as 3/4 height, like Trajan. This is working on the theory that they will be used in display with caps, whereas in text size it will be used within text. Does that make sense? I've done the text size small caps a bit bigger than x-height. Caslon's are at x-height, but I think they look better a bit bigger. </div>

<div class=commentbody><emthis is working on the theory that they will be used in display with caps, whereas in text size it will be used within text. does that make sense?</em>
Maybe, it probably depends on the (text) designer. When I use small caps in display, it is usually for a subhead -- usually a first-order subhead. Full caps are usually too big at text size; if you set them smaller, the size is right but the weight too thin. Small caps at text size have the right weight, but are too small. A set of small caps just a bit larger than "regular" or x-height small caps would be about ideal.
Truth to tell, I try to avoid small caps for subheads, because of my belief that the correct letterspacing of them (and the attendant word spacing) varies with how many words there are. Frequently, the number of words in subheads varies considerably, authors just don't think of all the problems they give us designers ;-).
Small caps can work quite well in running heads, sometime they too vary considerably in length, but there are far fewer chapters than subheads.
I'm not sure how a designer that favors cap-small cap in display would feel; I confess that design leaves me cold, but maybe that's just saying it doesn't fit my temperment and meager skill -- I rely mainly on space and color when I design.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>When I was working as an art director, I liked to use small caps, but for most fonts I found them much too short and small.
So I always make the small caps in my fonts quite a bit taller than the x-height, so that they work OK in all-small-caps settings, and as acronyms. I suspect that many type designers make them to look good in a caps-with-small-caps setting, or to match a paragraph of caps-with-small-caps against a paragraph of upper and lower case, in a specimen. But that's not how they are generally used.
I have recently discovered another reason for bigger small caps -- Cyrillic. Because the lower case Cyrillic (especially in Russian) has the look of small caps, with capital letterforms and few extenders, it's necessary to bump up the size of the small caps in a typeface to get adequate differentiation.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some of the comments in this thread about proportional scaling and width may be confusing to some people, since the illustrations for the how-to have disappeared. In my method, the width gain is all in the stem weight, which works pretty well perhaps because of the kind of proportions my uppercase letters seem to have. One of the first stages of the process is to make a mask of the caps scaled to the smallcap height that will serve as a guide to the <em>internal</em> width of the smallcaps. As Charles notes, you may be more pleased if this scaling is non-uniform: scaling the width less than the height if you want relatively squarer smallcaps from relatively narrower uppercase letters. My uppercase letters tend to be pretty wide, so I've not found this kind of adjustment necessary in most designs.</div>

Again, much depends on the design of your original uppercase letters and also, of course, on the height of your smallcaps. My typical smallcaps are noticeably taller than the lowercase x-height, but with the same vertical stem weight at the lowercase letters (usually based on the width of the lowercase i stem). With these sorts of proportions, and the typical width of my uppercase letters, this approach produces the kind of smallcaps I find most useful. Optically, it means that the smallcap text is a touch lighter and more open in appearance than lowercase, which I think is a benefit, especially since naïve users cannot be relied upon to letterspace smallcaps. If any of these variables are different, then the scaling factor used to develop what I think of as the width-guide should be adjusted.
A good test of the width-guide is the smallcap O. If one has a very round, Garamondish uppercase O, then a non-uniform width-guide -- i.e. one in which the uppercase is scaled less horizontally than vertically to determine the interior widths -- could easily result in a smallcap O that is too wide. Here is Constantia, showing the proportional relationship of uppercase, smallcaps and lowercase, with the smallcaps derived from the uppercase using a uniform width guide. I wouldn't want the smallcap O getting any wider than this.

Bill: <em>deriving the proportions of the small caps with one uniform rule throughout the alphabet isn’t the only way, and perhaps for some designs not even the best way.</em>
True, but if the regularised approach produces an unfortunate result for one of the smallcap letters it may also be an indication that something is wrong with the uppercase.
By the way, not everyone starts with the uppercase. When designing Cambria, Jelle Bosma started with the smallcaps and then designed the uppercase. I suspect this might be his usual procedure.

<div class=commentbody>John is quite right about certain full caps going too wide when scaled to small caps, especially when the scaling isn't linear. Having said that, I find it easier to rework CDGOQ (& maybe B, P, R and U) -- take a few units out of each side. This may just be a personal foible, although I make the small caps "smaller" than what John indicates, and that may be part of it. The thing to remember is that the first, formulaic step is just a beginning; I don't think you get all the way to a final set of small caps through any formula. With that in mind, whatever "first steps" work best for you is the way to go. </div>

<div class=commentbody>>A good test of the width-guide is the smallcap O
For my design, based on Caslon, the small cap O looked better scaled not as wide as the H was scaled. I just checked and in Merganthaler Linotype's Caslon Old Face (1923) they do the same thing. I can't remember whether I checked what they did while doing mine, but in any case I think it works well. I don't have any 18th century Caslon model for the small caps, so I don't know what Caslon did--except that I can guarantee it won't be consistent!
I also just checked Adobe Garamond and Minion. In both of these the O is proportionally a bit wider--not narrower--than the H, compared to the caps. And in neither of these fonts are the counters as wide as they would be following John's guidelines.
My conclusion is that there are no hard and fast rules here, and one can do it successfully different ways.

Definitely. I was suggesting <em>a</em> method for approaching smallcap design (one that that captures the relative proportions of the uppercase letters and translates them into the smallcaps). I certainly didn't intend it to be taken as any kind of rule.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jumping in a bit late here...
Karsten,
<cite>If your font is MultipleMaster, with a weight axis, try Tim Ahrens’ RMX Tuner</cite>
The RMX Tuner is not intended for creating 'sets' of reduced glyphs (such as small caps).
The most suitable of the Remix Tools for creating small caps is the RMX Scaler. You can simply select your capitals, run the Scaler and create the small caps with your preferred suffix. Since you can precisely control the weight, width and height, and add spacing it is a 'one-stop-shop' and often does not require any further corrections at all.
If you then realise you want to change the horizontal propoertions of the small caps (e.g. making the B or S wider) you can easily do so with the Tuner.
William,
<cite>I don’t know how much adjustment is needed if you use the RMX tuner</cite>
I suggest you open a preview window next to the glyph window so you can instantly see the effect and choose the scaling and weight intuitively and visually. I believe this method is better and quicker than any other digital tool available. Note that if you use the Scaler right after you have used the Tuner the adjustment values are entered automatically.</div>

Oh, I realised you probably mean how much <cite>subsequent manual adjustment</cite> is needed. This is the crucial question, of course.
I personally did not make any manual corrections at all to the small caps of my own [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/Facit/index.htm|Facit]].
However, I thought that although my tools are suitable for my own designs I should test it with another typeface that has got manually designed small caps already.
I built Meta as an MM font and created small caps automatically, and then compared them to the "real" ones:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RMX_Meta_SC_4412.gif]
grey: Meta Small Caps, black line: automatically generated from the regular and bold capitals.
Not surprisingly, the ink traps are more emphasized in the original small caps but in general. However, I think this test demonstrates that my method gives very appropriate results and can save a great deal of time.

<div class=commentbody>Regarding the question whether all of the small caps can or should be reduced in the same way (i.e. retaining the horizontal proportions of the capitals), I have made some investigations. Instead of Latin small caps I chose the cyrillic lowercase letters which are "small caps" (please forgive this simplification).
I reproduced the lowercase of Alexander Tarbeev's Den Haag (shown below) and Gauge with the RMX tools letter by letter and noted down the required horizontal scale factor (the veritcal one being constant):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RMX_DenHaag_6742.gif]
This is just a first experiment in this direction but with further research it might be possible to establish a general "key" for cyrillic that then helps western designers to choose the right proportions. Or maybe one would find out that every type designer has their own, personal, quantifiable style?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tim, I like what you propose, but I really think the lowercase Cyrillic letters need to be considered independently of smallcaps. Yes, many of them are based on the same shapes as the uppercase forms, but the very fact that they need to proportionally harmonise with some lowercase letters that are differentiated from the uppercase letters requires them to assume a different set of proportions. It is helpful to bear in mind that Cyrillic was a unicameral (uncial) alphabet for a lot longer than either Latin or Greek, and that its conversion into a bicameral alphabet happened relatively suddenly. So what you see in the lowercase alphabet are not 'smallcaps', but uncial letters writ small, while the uppercase represent the same uncial letters writ large. This is a very different evolutionary path than that which produced smallcaps from uppercase letters (brilliantly explored in Margaret Smith's essay 'The Pre-history of "Small Caps": from All Caps to Smaller Capitals to Small Caps', in volume 22 of the <em>Journal of the Printing Historical Society</em> (UK)). The term smallcaps presumes the pre-existence of uppercase letters; the division of an uncial script into a bicameral alphabet is a different process. When the bicameral alphabet introduces foreign letterforms not native to the preceding uncial script, as the Petrine reform of Cyrillic did, then the proportions of the two cases of letters adapt to their new partners, and lose the relationship that they might have had to each other. This, of course, makes true Cyrillic smallcaps possible.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tim: <cite>“small caps” (please forgive this simplification).</cite>
John: <cite>what you see in the lowercase alphabet are not ’smallcaps’</cite>
John, I am not so naive as to think the cyrillic lowercase is the same thing as small caps. I had hoped my little note in parentheses would make that clear.
However, I believe it is not senseless to study the proportional relations between cyrillic uppercase and lowercase, and even relate that to latin small caps. For example, the reason why the в (lowercase ve) is proportionally wider in the lowercase (see the above illustration) is certainly the same as the reason why a latin small cap B would be made relatively wider than letters with only one counter.</div>

<div class=commentbody>But in the design of a Cyrillic type, the width of the lowercase в needs to be coordinated with the width of the lowercase а. So this is a very good example of what I am talking about. Yes, the reasons why в proportionally wider in the lowercase than in the uppercase is related to the reason why a smallcap B is proportionally wider than the uppercase, but the precise width of the в is determined relative to other lowercase letters, most importantly а, not relative to the uppercase. This explains why an actual Cyrillic smallcap В might well have a different proportional relationship to the uppercase than the lowercase has. These comments are based on a lot of experience designing Cyrillic types. Smallcaps can be derived systematically from uppercase letters, but lowercase letters need to be designed independently, proportionally relative to each other. So this is why I think it is a mistake to look at the particular proportions of lowercase Cyrillic letters as something that can be related to smallcaps, because I think these proportions involve other influences.
A good experiment would be to apply your approach to typefaces that include Cyrillic smallcaps, so you can show a three-way relationship. This would reveal the difference between the proportions of actual smallcaps and lowercase letters relative to the uppercase.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for sharing your experience, John.
I am a bit confused. Do you check each of the Cyrillic lowercase letters that can be regarded reduced versions of their uppercase counterpart individually against the a, or do you also consider the horizontal proportions <cite>within</cite> the letters that can be regarded reduced versions of their uppercase counterpart?
The latter is exactly what I was interested in. I wanted to know in which way the proportions <cite>within</cite> the uppercase differ from the proportions <cite>within</cite> the lowercase. That's also what my above diagram is about, isn't it? The diagram is supposed to visualise the relation between the intra-uppercase proportions and the intra-lowercase proportions.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Do you check each of the Cyrillic lowercase letters that can be regarded reduced versions of their uppercase counterpart individually against the a, or do you also consider the horizontal proportions within the letters that can be regarded reduced versions of their uppercase counterpart?</em>
This is the thing: I <em>don't</em> regard them as reduced versions of their uppercase counterparts. I think it is a mistake to regard them as reduced versions of their uppercase counterparts, just as it would be a mistake to regard the uppercase letters as big versions of the lowercase.
I understand your diagram, but what I am saying is that it misses the input from the other lowercase letters. This input is important, especially in the case of an Cyrillic designed to harmonise with an existing Latin design in which several key letters are inherited from the Latin (thanks to Peter the Great!). It also misses the cumulative input derived for iterations of the lowercase design, i.e. not just the influence of lowercase-distinct architecture in some letters, but the influence of the cumulative design decisions about lowercase letters.
I design the Cyrillic lowercase and the uppercase largely independently -- as independently as the Latin lowercase and uppercase --, and unlike smallcaps the proportions of lowercase letters are not derived from uppercase. Within the set of letters that share similar uppercase and lowercase architecture, the same kind of proportional awareness is important <em>within the individual cases</em>. For instance, the variation of internal width in the sequence инпџцшщ is similar to that in the sequence ИНПЏЦШЩ, but they are arrived at independently, checking lowercase against lowercase and uppercase against uppercase.</div>

I'd say it depends on the typeface.
You can start by doing global transformations to the upper case glyphs.
1. Scale down: Actions>Contour>Scale
2. Add weight: Actions>Effects>Bold
In either of these, you may add slightly more to the x axis.
For serif fonts, cutting, pasting, and dragging can also be useful methods.
A good way to see what's working is to compare, in the Metrics window, those letters that are basically the same in all three cases, C, O, S, V, W, X.
It's also a good idea to test your small caps, in a piece of text in InDesign or Quark, against a typeface of similar style.
Try it in a piece of text with "U.S." or similar ambiguous acronyms, and with all-small-cap lead-ins to text paragraphs.
In page layout applications, you can get a feel for the transformation required by making faux small caps using scaling and stroking.

<div class=commentbody>It's tricky stuff, this is.
For the characters I need for phonetics, I had to make matching small caps of a handful of characters, which needed to be able to blend in with actual lowercase characters -- the small caps characters depict valid phonemes on their own. Usually, one only needs to worry about caps-and-small caps.
I also need some of these reversed, upside-down, or both (rotated!), which may have side effects on the stroke contrasts. Stuff like
vɛʀy dʀoʊl, mˈlɔːːːːd
.. to top it off, there are also a couple of "required" superscripts. Same problem there: I'd prefer nice, fat, same-stroke-width ones over regular-made-smallers. I already found out "just" vertically shrinking a lowercase 'h' to get 'ʰ' doesn't quite <em>do</em> it for me.</div>

BTW, one reason you make small cps slightly wider is so they can hold their own against the lower case letters. They often appear on the same line. Wouldn't look right if a small cap "O", for example, wasn't a bit wider than a lower case "o"...
It is almost like you need three sets of small caps. One for display, one for run-in acronyms, and one for phonetics. That's a bit much to ask, so compromises arise.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You're talking about my proportions etc. in general (irrespective of what size of caps we're talking about) which -I hope- are like that for a reason (just like I make my tittles "too big"). Here I'm interesting in figuring out if smallcaps are in fact better (or at least not worse) when they have the same proportions as the fullcaps. Maybe I should use a different font, something mainstream that would allow people to focus on this question. Let me see...
<blockquote>so they can hold their own against the lower case letters.</blockquote>
That's certainly true in the case of old-school smallcaps that are at x-height (or only slightly taller). The way many people (including myself) like to make smallcaps these days is quite a bit higher than that, which makes confusion with the lc moot. Of course this doesn't work when the x-height is too big (not leaving enough room between it and the fullcap height) but to me such fonts aren't really text fonts.
<blockquote>it is almost like you need three sets of small caps.</blockquote>
At least. :-)
Do you know about FF Atma? And Ernestine has one extra set too.

<div class=commentbody>The thing is that to do this test I need a font family with close weights, and since I don't actually <em>use</em> fonts much I came up blank... But it's easy enough to try it yourself: set something like "THE MICROFOUNDRY" in the Regular at some size; change the "HE", "ICRO" and "OUNDRY" to the Demi weight, then reduce the size* of that text until the color matches the "T", "M" and "F". Adjust the letterspacing as you see fit. Then tell me what you see wrong with it.
* Unless the font has an unusually large x-height you'll stay clear of any potential confusion with the lc.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, note that I said balance colour between the uppercase, smallcaps <em>and lowercase.</em> There is a threeway relationship to be established. Often, if smallcaps are proportionally similar to the uppercase then they will appear too narrow relative to lowercase letters, just as uppercase letters would appear too wide if their proportions were similar to typical smallcap letters. As you reduce the height of caps, you need to compensate horizontally for the reduction of counter space, especially for a letter like B. Of course, I am talking about text faces in text settings.</div>

I think you're mistaken about the method of printing small caps in the letterpress era.
I also think you should refine your test string, since /T/M/F/ just happen to have relatively small counters or semi-enclosed spaces. But anyway, here's your test in my font-in-progress, Millennial, FWIW.

<div class=commentbody>@Hrant: Of course small capitals are larger because they have to work smaller.
Most of what has been developed and learned in centuries of lead type setting is not strictly related to the printing technology. You can see how small capitals work better with a wider proportions by decreasing the size of your own typeface. In fact, you can see they work better even if you are writing by hand.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Not that'd I'd expect anyone to go to all the work, but theoretically...
The small caps needed for phonetics should be drawn up special. They also have a Unicode code point, unlike small caps generally. They need to blend into the general lower-case letters, and be kerned with other phonetic & lower case sorts, but probably not against each other.
The small caps to be switched in by an OT feature probably should be the ones used in running text, for acronyms & abbreviations. Depending on your school of thought, that has implications for height & width. Kerning is only needed against each other and punctuation, & maybe full caps, though that's another issue (used in some legal styles like "Harvard Blue," etc.).
The "Display" small caps are those intended for use in a subhead, chapter number, that sort of thing. Maybe even a TABLE or FIGURE head... It can be argued that these do not have to mix with lower case letters, and can have different height/width properties. They probably have to work with full capitals. One way to deal with them would be to use a separate font, as Adam Twardoch has mooted from time to time. Or perhaps a stylistic set.
The compositor can do some work by using different character styles. Any needed differences between the "display" & "running text" will likely be small, and the layout program's scaling for a few percentages points change is one way to go. It isn't ideal for several reasons -- the contrast of the characters will change a little (stem, fine lines), as will the weight generally if you use more than about 5 percent. Kerning will be maintained within the set of small caps the character style is applied to, but not with characters not included the character style, with punctuation being the most common problem.
Then, I suppose if you're being really pure, except for the phonetics which have a Unicode index, you need them both mapped from capitals and mapped from lower case (c2sc and smcp). <cite>[Edit: FWIW, I don't think this is worthwhile generally. In fact, with fonts where it's legal to modify them, I've been known to go in & take out the lower-case mapping. There is always some handwork in using text extracted from a pdf, and 99.9 percent of the time, any odd full caps are going to occur where you expect them to.]</cite>
Just some of the issues that can come up with small caps in the use of type.
Personally, I wouldn't bother to do all that in a font. Too much work for too little gain -- esp. since the designers who select what typeface will be used in a document will get bored with one font family fairly quickly, and move on.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Craig, a lot depends on how small caps are set in combo with U&lc.

For old-style types in which the small caps are “petite”, very close to x-height, it was customary to letter space them, they <em>are</em> capitals, after all. (They appeared a lot like old style figures—which are tabular—with a lot of inherent sidebearing space.) By the same token, small caps that are a lot larger than x-height may be set tight, like the lower case.
Compare:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Micro_6551.png]
1. Petite small caps, normal spacing
2. Petite small caps, letter spaced
3. Small caps, normal spacing
In the top face, which is something of an old style, setting #2 is preferable.
In the bottom face, a didone, #3 is preferable, because letterspacing doesn’t suit this kind of didone (unless it is an all cap setting, with lots of spacing).
And remember: <strong>Real typographers never set caps with small caps!</strong></div>

Depends on what world you live in. In my world (books) anything the editor feels trumps whatever the designer or typesetter feels. And if the editor defers, both the book designer and compositor trump the type designer... Now, just who is the "typographer" in that long sequence?
But in general, I say if you use them, let the chips fall where they may. Anything else gets you into a terrible tangle. & I'd tend to say use them in text, but not in U&lc display, esp. if initial caps are used in the displayed material. </div>

I forget.
With acronyms, a lot depends on the typeface and the genre of job it’s being used in.
One also has to consider what the ﬁgures are like.
<em>Nick, why didn't you build more generous spacing into the petite caps in the oldstyle font?</em>
It makes sense to match the default look of small caps to that of All Caps (with “cpsp” if it’s in the font).
That way, it’s a benchmark that typographers can relate to, adding tracking as necessary.
For instance, in a “title page” usage mixing All Caps with All Small Caps, you want to have a consistent letterspacing when the typographer adds, say, 100 units of tracking throughout.

<div class=commentbody>The pattern pieces (line and box draw characters) were not intended to be included in all WGL4 fonts: they are only included in the spec for console fonts. This used to be clearer in early documentation of WGL4, which distinguished between the core set and the optional inclusions. Unfortunately, more recent documentation has omitted this distinction; I'm not sure why.
There really is no reason to include line and box draw characters in anything but a monospaced font, since they are entirely dependent on such spacing in order to work correctly. So, for example, of the ClearType fonts, which were based around the WGL4 set -- with some additions -- only Consolas supports these characters.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It probably depends on to whom you are making the claim. Some years ago, at a Unicode conference, I was sitting next to Michel Suignard from Microsoft, who was primarily resposible for defining the WGL4 set, and I recall that he agreed with my interpretation of the then published spec that the line and box draw characters were optional, outside of the core set. But one possible reason for the removal of the core/optional distinction in the documentation might be that software developers want to be certain about what characters a font contains if it claims WGL4 support. An equivocal option would be to claim that a font provides 'WGL4 language set support'.</div>

I suppose I could make an equivocal claim, but having drawn the line and box characters, I can put them in every “Pan-European” font now, so I might as well.
I think certain potential customers will be reassured to know that the full WGL4 character set is supported.

<div class=commentbody><em>Strange that the combining diacritical marks are not a part of WGL4. Doesn't that put Microsoft & Unicode a bit at odds?</em>
No. WGL4 is a superset of 8-bit encodings for European languages using the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts, plus a few additions. Since it deliberately only supports those languages that do not require combining marks, it omits them. It is also worth noting that WGL4 is pretty old now, and it's been almost a decade since it was defined as the procurement requirement for any work I've done for Microsoft. We extended even those ClearType fonts that are not Office core fonts to support Vietnamese and some symbol and extra numeric glyphs not in WGL4.
<em>We get in a number of manuscripts these days where even simple ones like an a with an acute are typed as two characters, U+0061 followed by U+0301.</em>
Which Microsoft would automatically map to the precomposed character in the font cmap during display.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I generally use the IBM extended <a href=http://www.borgendale.com/glyphs.htm>Universal (or Unified) Glyph List</a> (which is undoubtedly descended from a common source as WGL4) as the basis of character support if I want to expand coverage outside Latin-1. That's mostly because the first fonts I designed were targeted at OS/2 users, of course. Since then I've just kept the habit because I figure it's as good a system as any.
I don't mean that I <em>support</em> the whole thing, just that I use it as a rough guideline for "I should really plan to support these characters" up to a certain cut-off (usually about the 383 mark, although I often include the 505-529 region as well).
It used to be divided into a few language-specific versions. TypeTool (and presumably FontLab) includes obsolete mapping tables for them; I created an updated one for the full UGL which I use.</div>

WGL5?
Sorry to belabor this, but it seems to me that the community beneﬁts from having a specially named encoding for Pan-European coverage; it’s a shorthand which lets users know that what they’re getting will do the job, validated by Microsoft.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, is there such a thing as a current Microsoft standard? Perhaps as Nick suggests, a WGL5? Perhaps a type community generated standard would be more appropriate, if such a thing could ever be agreed upon...</div>

<div class=commentbody>WGL4 stands as a pretty good basis for pan-European language support.
Microsoft's expanding procurement requirements reflect their own market priorities, which might not be everyone else's market priorities, especially not every font foundry's priorities. How many font makers are selling end user licenses in Vietnam or Kyrgyzstan? There are a few things that can be picked up from examining the Win7/8 release versions of e.g. Constantia. For example, if you are making Greek fonts -- even Monotonic ones -- you might want to consider including the numeric koppa character: apparently there was enough of a call for this (it is used as a symbol in legal documents) for Microsoft to add it to all their fonts with Greek support.</div>
