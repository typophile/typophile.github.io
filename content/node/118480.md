  languages. Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew &c. has it\u2019s own list below the Latin,
  but when I tried to install a Bengali font, it sorts under Latin. Can anyone enlighten
  me on exactly how the font menu and encoding settings are linked?"

    to tell, InDesign only creates separate groupings for Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Chinese,
    Japanese, and Korean. Everything else simply gets grouped together with Latin.
    I suspect this may have to do with the fact that the menu was designed with Adobe
    fonts in mind, and that the menu architecture was finalized sometime after the
    release of Adobe Thai but before the release of their more recent Indic fonts.
    Presumably Greek and Cyrillic don't get separate menu ranges since all adobe fonts
    which cover these languages also cover latin.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    the heuristics back in the day, with Sairus Patel who was creating them.\r\n\r\nIn
    the end, I came to the conclusion that <em>any</em> such effort to simply segregate
    the font menu into static sections based on language support was doomed to create
    more problems than it solved, but I was told the client apps insisted on it. So
    here we are.\r\n\r\nAllowing the user to filter by support for some particular
    writing system or language would be cool, though. But a lot more work to implement
    the interface."
