  body: The letter style we call Tuscan goes back to the 3rd Century Rome at least,
    according to Rob Roy Kelly in "American Wood Type." He also says that it probably
    originated with the Greeks. It's named after Tuscany where, presumably, one would
    find a lot of examples of this style of letter. It's not clear if the name was
    used before the 19th Century when the style became wildly popular for display
    typefaces.
