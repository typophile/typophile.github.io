<p>I just received this via email from  my much admired professor Dr. Klimis Mastoridis and would like to share it with you as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MoMA has just acquired 23 digital typefaces for its Architecture and Design Collection. Some are of everyday use, like Verdana; others are familiar characters in our world, like Gotham, which was used in President Obama’s election campaign, or OCR-A, which we can find at the bottom of any product’s bar code; and others are still less common, but exquisitely resonant, like Walker or Template Gothic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may read the full article <a href="http://moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/01/24/digital-fonts-23-new-faces-in-moma-s-collection">here</a>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>How can a museum &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; something with no capital value?
This is listism, and not much different from the commentary of anyone who has written an opinionated type history, from Updike to Blackwell.</p>
<p>The return on investment—the value added—from which the museum profits in admission fees and collateral revenue (catalog sales &amp;c.), is produced by the curators.</p>
<p>I am in two minds of how good this is for type designers. On the one hand, being propped by MoMA enhances our status, but on the other it devalues our work. Let&rsquo;s face it, &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo; typefaces is a cheap way to put on a show. I don&rsquo;t see any House Industries fonts on the list — their licence (for, say, the brilliantly Postmodern Chalet, a suitably modern arty type) may have been a bit prohibitive, perhaps gearing fees to gallery admissions!</p>
<p>It also undermines the position of the museum, because it opens the door for virtual curation. Now anyone can be a curator.</p>
<p>Fontshop&rsquo;s Best of 2009 was &ldquo;hand picked&rdquo; &ndash; will its Best of 2010 be &ldquo;curated&rdquo;? I hope so!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>FontShop has already been using the word &ldquo;curated&rdquo; to describe their selection of fonts on offer (e.g. [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/category/|&ldquo;Special collections called &ldquo;FontLists&rdquo; are curated by FontShop experts&hellip;&quot;]]).
And their Best of 2010 [[http://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/december10b/index.html|came out last month already]]. You didn&rsquo;t notice?&ndash; your fonts are on it!</p>
<p>As for the larger questions about what &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; means, I note that kottke.org posted a few words from Jonathan Hoefler under the promising title &ldquo;[[http://kottke.org/11/01/moma-acquires-digital-typefaces-what-does-that-mean|MoMA acquires digital typefaces; what does that mean?]] But I&rsquo;m not sure I see Hoefler&rsquo;s answer to that question there, and instead he raises still more puzzling questions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m not necessarily unhappy that type design is receiving additional recognition as a creative venture.</p>
<p>But I’m trying to wrap my head around these new definitions of “acquisition” and just what a museum is these days.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.printmag.com/Article/-At-MoMA">Heller article</a> linked above, quoting curator Paola Antonelli: <cite>“. . . it sets curators free to tag the world and acknowledge things that &lsquo;cannot be had,&rsquo; because they are too big (buildings, Boeing 747’s, satellites), or because they are in the air and belong to everybody and to no one, . . . as art objects befitting MoMA’s collection. There is no need to physically possess. After this, the world is ours to tag and collect.”</cite></p>
<p>I suppose perhaps next MOMA’s Department of Architecture and Design might decide to “acquire” Frank Gehry’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Guggenheim-bilbao-jan05.jpg">Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao</a>?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No selection of typefaces could ever claim to be universally valid.
And I’m probably expecting too much of a type-historical component in such a listing.</p>
<p>But this is darn 1990s-heavy. To me, typefaces like Blur or Template Gothic represent rather the exploration of new technical possibilities and very temporary shapes without adding to, let alone creating something of ‘revisionary’ value (is that even a word?).
I haven’t seen these two particular designs for a while and every time I see them, it’s either a design from the 90s or something that unfortunately looks like from the 90s.</p>
<p>So many type-historically important typefaces are missing, wouldn’t even know where to start.
And what about Georg Salden’s GST Polo?

<a href="http://www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/polo/designinfo.html">http://www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/polo/designinfo.html</a>
Designed from 1972-1976, it anticipated Meta and everything that has seemingly been anticipated by Meta.</p>
<p>@ Nick Shinn:
You might consider donating one of your typefaces, apparently that’s how some typefaces got into this ‘selection’.
[I’d never doubt that Retina is a great design – but isn’t it still far from being new or outstanding, even (or even more) in 1999?]</p>

<p>At the same time the selection and reasons provided for each typeface&rsquo;s inclusion suggest that it is less the typefaces themselves which have been added to the collection, but that they rather serve to represent technological and/or esthetical milestones. Unfortunately the choice exhibits a pretty narrow view on type, but is quite telling about what type is to &ldquo;graphic design critics, designers, and historians&rdquo; (mentioned as advisors in the <a href="http://moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/01/24/digital-fonts-23-new-faces-in-moma-s-collection" target="_blank">article</a>): design critics remembered FUSE, designers know <em>the</em> NY type foundry, and Mr Carter thanks to previous recognition, etc. Plus something along the line, oh, wait, I know yet another Carter and/or Hoefler we could include too. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What really stands out to me is the failure on the part of MoMA to research attributions. MoMA attributes Gotham to “Jonathan Hoefler (American, born 1970) and Tobias Frere-Jones (American, born 1970)”. But if one goes back to the Gotham specimen in the 2002 book “Language, Culture, Type” the design was attributed to “Tobias Frere-Jones, Jesse M. Ragan”. Jesse is no longer at H&amp;FJ and is no longer credited for the Gotham design by H&amp;FJ, but if MoMA is going to show Gotham in their collection they should explain why their attribution does not match the earlier attribution. Hopefully MoMA is not just letting type vendors write their own attributions and accepting that as gospel.</div>

<p>Now they are crediting type designers, which is very cool, despite the dubious nature of the &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; concept.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This selection is, as any kind of our statements as human beings, a purely subjective definition of truth. And as any definition of truth, it is a means of power. As in similar selective typeface listings, the people behind it have their own POV and interests. Meh.</p>
<p>Of course one could question if their definition couldn’t be more representative (i. e. borne by more people who deal with type / type history).
But who’s to define whether someone is capable of defining a more representative selection or not?
;)</p>
<p>JoergGustafs:
I share your sentiments towards said two 90s typefaces. For similar reasons, I wouldn’t expect a Jugendstil typeface in such a selection, from a present-day perspective (the different socio-cultural background being another one of the many parameters to define our perspective, of course!!).
/side note:
Your mention of Salden is interesting since it probably shows the power of the authority to define, the power of sovereignty of definition.
Then again, on a personal note, it was Meta and its popularity that made me take notice of GST Polo.
And I know that this is true for most of the younger designers who heard about Salden / Polo.
Wouldn’t this make Meta some kind of predecessor of Polo?</p>
<p>dezcom:
I totally agree with you on that «20-years significance filter» (sorry if I’m putting you words in your mouth). But wouldn’t this reveal, as mentioned earlier, that said 2 typefaces have NOT (or not yet) passed that filter?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ aarhaus: You’re right, I also found out about Polo through Meta or at least long after heaving heard of Meta.
I mentioned it because Meta is featured as well as Retina, and these two, being about 20 years younger than Polo, add nothing strikingly new or better IMHO. Polo has a small size version with ink traps.
(Although, I realise that Retina was probably rather inspired by Bell Centennial – which is also featured – and Frutiger and/or Myriad)
Again, I’m not trying to ‘sully’ the reputation of any of these fonts (which I am not capable of anyway) but I’d wish that selections like this would take the opportunity to credit some of the lesser known pioneers. Instead, the people who do these selections most often rely on the established ‘authorities’, as you put it.</p>
<p>@ Sii: From the article you linked to I can see this exhibition is just part of a SouthAfrican-European plot to dethrone a major US company ;-P</p>
