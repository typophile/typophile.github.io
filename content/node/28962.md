    do you think that the combination [ \u201EW ] needs kerning?"

  body: Nice pages. I think I like Raffia in a 2nd color better. I have not seen enough
    examples of use to know for sure.

  body: Both are rotated, aren't they? The W is a rotated M, and the M is a rotated
    W. Reminds me of Gill Sans, where they had to add notes to the side of the lead
    letters to distinguish uppercase I from lowercase l from numder 1. :^)

    the M turned over in fact?

  body: "Yes Yves and Eben, they're both rotated and Raffia has a W and an M. I suspect
    the compositor saw the M as a W and vice versa. So the inversion was not accidental
    or out of need.\r\n\r\nHrant, I decided to let the 'ugly' stand because the smiley
    made me think Andreas was trying to get a rise out of me.\r\n\r\nEben, here it
    is in colour.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lucifer_actopener#1_6558.jpg]\r\n\r\nAndreas,
    still ugly?\r\n\r\nNick, it does seem like the ,,W needs kerning. Anyone know
    what was normative practice in settings with this style of open quote marks?"

  body: "Than I reviewed the specimen from Lettergieterij Amsterdam, I was stunned
    about these initials and the gap between the rest of their type portfolio.\r\n\r\nYes,
    the second layout shows an tastefull usage. But overall, the design of the initials
    reminds me on barbwire, brambles or scratches. If you print them black, they have
    \"dark\" power like a strong sign or statement.\r\n\r\nI know nothing about the
    first book and its purpose, but the initials look out of place.\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"

  body: "Andreas, viewed as an entire alphabet on a specimen sheet at smaller sizes
    the letters don't present themselves well. One by one with ample whitespace they
    are in my opinion quite stunning. \r\n\r\nMy presentation at ATypI in Vancouver
    2003 should clarify what these initials should remind you of.\r\n\r\nThe book
    the upside-down samples come from is:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/naimeh_najafi_5076.jpg]\r\n\r\n<em>My
    Heart is in Persia</em> by Naimeh Najafi (autobiography)\r\n\r\nI take it the
    Persian reference was the reason for the choice of Raffia Initial. The Raffia
    Initials share some stroke contrast and 'role architectural' characteristics with
    Arabic calligraphy. However, they are in my opinion not properly or custom fitted.
    I'll ask the person who provided me with the scans to show me the fit on other
    chapters.\r\n\r\nThe other sample was for a bibliophile production, where the
    creator of the initials was also the typographer (and illustrator) of the book.\r\n\r\nJust
    noticing this: The Raffia upside-down W is in some ways more in tune with the
    swash M used on the dust jacket than the Raffia M is!"
