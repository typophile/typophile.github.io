body: "Hello, \r\nI have a client who is looking to redesign their collateral. Currently
  they use Gill Sans as a text face and a modified version of [[http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?POttBk.html|Ottomat]]
  (set at a loose tracking of 50+). The current design is sparce and polite, safe
  and conservative. \r\n\r\nRecently, my client realised that they need to appeal
  to a younger market, and so have requested a redesign. Trouble is, the organisation
  is a part of a larger state government body, which has just gone through a design
  process and allocated Palatino LT as body copy (very office-like). \r\n\r\nSo with
  Palatino LT as a starting point, I need to develop a typography that achieves the
  following:\r\n1. Allows the expression of emotions - tourism is motivational\r\n2.
  Is attention grabbing and has an interesting cut\r\n3. Is slightly feminine (but
  not girly)\r\n4. Is sophisticated to reflect a sense of style\r\n5. Is legible\r\n6.
  Has the ability to work in complex tables and cartography\r\n7. Works as a display
  face to introduce sections\r\n\r\nThe typography can be made up of a series of typefaces
  with a similar theme, not just a large single family (ala Clan).\r\n\r\nFonts I
  have been looking at to date include:\r\nPriva, Parry & Parry Grotesque, Dolly,
  Stag, Fling.\r\n\r\nI am going blind, racking up a great font library and not really
  getting any closer to a solution. I'd love to get something designed, but budget
  and time don't allow it.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions???\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nJason."
