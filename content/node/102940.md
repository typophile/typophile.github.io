  OSF, Blackletter, &c.) that is closest to the original which pairs well with Goudy
  Sans. I\u2019d opt for a larger family that meets the afore mentioned criteria over
  an \u201Cauthentic\u201D version with a single style. \r\n\r\nI have found many
  options, but it\u2019s the authenticity/complete family/pairs with sans tradeoff
  that I am struggling with.\r\n\r\nVersions with a Web option would be ideal.\r\n\r\nMy
  short list at this point is:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/497/Goudy-family.html\">Goudy
  font family</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/font/itc/itc-goudy-sans#product_top\">ITC
  Goudy Sans</a>\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

    Goudy Oldstyle italic.

  body: "Two sources for Goudy stuff are [[http://www.p22.com/lanston/|Lanston Type
    Company]], part of P22, and I see that at [[http://www.goudyfonts.com/|Goudyfonts]]
    there are links to many fonts\u2014though some of their links are broken. Steve
    Matteson has revived some Goudy fonts; you can see the links [[http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/SteveMatteson/|here]].
    And Font Bureau's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/CalifornianFB/|Californian]]
    has had various hands reviving its weights, including Carol Twombly and David
    Berlow. And Berlow did Goudy's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Village/|Village]].
    Tony Stan's [[http://www.linotype.com/580/ITCBerkeleyOldStyle-family.html|ITC
    Berkeley]] us another, softer take on Goudy's California Old Style. \r\n\r\nLanston's
    Goudy Old Style has the option of the original full descenders, which is nice.
    I think Typophiler Paul Hunt had a hand in the Lanston Goudy revivals, but I'm
    not sure. The Font Bureau's versions have tons of weights and styles.    \r\n\r\nThe
    quality varies at lot\u2014including among Goudy's originals!\u2014 so sorting
    through these will take a while. I haven't done it.  \r\n "

  body: I've worked with very few Goudy types. I'm not a fan. I admire Scripps College
    Old Style, and to a lesser extent Californian, but that's about it. This isn't
    to say that I don't recognise his importance or understand why some of my colleagues
    are such big fans. And I do appreciate Goudy's insistence on controlling the production
    process, of not only designing but cutting and casting his own type. In this respect
    he is the fore-runner of all of us who make our own digital fonts. But most of
    Goudy's types are not to my taste.

  body: 'I think I remember Erik Spiekermann, who I think likes Goudy, saying that
    Goudy Sans is ''over designed''. By that I think he means that it is so assertive
    and has so much personality and individual quirks that its use is restricted.
    Personally, I think it can look great in some settings by itself, but I''m skeptical
    about it ''playing well with others.'' Because of the slanted crossbar on the
    e, you might try some of Goudy''s many faces with slanted crossbars on the e,
    such as Deepdene. '

    A wonderful, lyrical sort of cross between a blackletter and a roman.\r\n\r\nAnd
    of course there are others, like Deepdene (maybe my favorite) that are not eponymous,
    but these certainly weren't meant as part of the \"Goudy family.\""
