  close to being done, but any critiques would be very welcome. \r\n\r\nA little background
  on the company:\r\n\r\n1) First off, I did not choose the name of the company. It
  still urks me.\r\n2) The company specializes in ceilings of all sorts, but also
  does woodwork (such as carpentry, cabinetry, and other wood-related practices)\r\n3)
  The guy has been doing this stuff since about 1970 and is very traditional in his
  approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nI obviously tried to encompass these traits and really work
  to convey a traditional, old-style, blue-collar feel.\r\n\r\nAgain, please let me
  know what you think, be it general or specific.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks very much for
  looking!"

    point. I agree, silly name, but you've done well with what you have to work with.\r\n\r\nIt
    literally says 'ceilings' but the look and feel certainly give a nice craftsmanship
    feel to acknowledge the greater service offerings.\r\n\r\nOnly major thing is
    that the 'S' in ceilings appears optically larger, even though I'm sure it's not.
    You might want to fudge the size of that a bit to bring it in balance."

  body: "Exactly what I thought.\r\n\r\nMake the fatter stroke on the 'S' narrower
    to optically match the rest. I think the 'C' is probably OK."

    it before. A long, long time ago. I think it progressed really well though with
    some new direction.\r\n\r\nI'll look at modifying the 'S'.\r\n\r\nThanks very
    much!"

  body: I think it's great!  I see the "S," too.  Since I've been coming here for
    help, I'd love to know how long it took you to do this and if you just tried it
    in Illustrator / Paint, etc. or if you drew it on paper first.  I love the ornamental
    touch to the lines.

  body: "This isn't a comment on the type... which as been addressed ad-nauseum. First
    off, this is a very elegant looking design, and would look fabulous as a wood
    etched sign. Two things jumped out at me.\r\n\r\nFirst, the border is very nice,
    but it's also very heavy and compared to the weight of the text, seems almost
    too heavy. My eye is drawn to it almost immediately. This almost give the text
    inside a very trapped feeling to it.\r\n\r\nSecond, is more of a nit-picky issue.
    The rounded corners of the border, though keeping with the soft look of the inner
    stroke, seems too soft. I think sharp corners would play against the softness
    of your detail better.\r\n\r\nThose are my opinions, either way, you have a nice
    design going for this."

  body: "Thank you all for the great critiques. It's really great to have such good,
    critical looks available. So that you all very much.\r\n\r\nI am actually going
    to try sharper corners. I'm not sure if I want them to be square, as part of the
    concept was that it was to look like it was an old-school wood routed sign, but
    maybe a little less rounded. Thanks!\r\n\r\nKristi, to answer your question: all
    told, this logo probably took about 10 hours of work, not including visual research
    and planning. And unfortunately, for this one, I did not start by sketching, although
    I went back to it a couple times. Part of my process is to get jobs, really dig
    into researching them -visual and otherwise- then let them simmer for a while.
    In this case what took so long was that the company name is very, very vague and
    hard to work with, so I got trapped into thinking that I could make it whatever
    I wanted, which was not the case. When I went back and thought about the founder,
    the work and what the company actually did I realized the name was just that:
    a name; and that the actual look and direction for the design was better predicated
    by those other factors, and not on the name itself.\r\n\r\n"
