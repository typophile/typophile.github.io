body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI'm new to the forum, but look forward to participating in it.  I
  really like the design and way it functions - very different to other boards! :)\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to ask about books for novices.  I see it's been covered before, but some of
  the books I mention below (all found on Amazon.com) are relatively new.  Does anyone
  have any advice as to which of these books (or any others) one should or shouldn't
  go for?  I'm open to getting more than one (though obviously not too many :)).\r\n\r\nI'm
  interested in type as it is used today - in advertising, book/magazine/document
  layout, digitally (on-screen documents, websites, etc.), as an art-form on it's
  own.  I'm also interested in the history of type, but I'm really looking for a book
  that offers practical advice on layout and type use.  I'm very interested in design
  in general, so I'm also open to books that cover type as a part/chapter.\r\n\r\nI've
  enjoyed reading \"The Rules of Typography\" and other articles on The Font Site
  (www. fontsite.com), so a book would similar advice would be nice (if that's recommended).\r\n\r\nThe
  books I've found are:\r\n\r\nTypography\r\nby Friedrich Friedl\r\n\r\nTypography
  Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Using Type in Graphic Design\r\nby Timothy Samara\r\n\r\nTypography:
  Macro- and Microaesthetics\r\nby Willi Kunz\r\n\r\nType & Typography\r\nby Phil
  Baines and Andrew Haslam\r\n\r\nThinking with Type : A Critical Guide for Designers,
  Writers, Editors, and Students (Design Briefs)\r\nby Ellen Lupton\r\n\r\nThe Elements
  of Typographic Style\r\nby Robert Bringhurst\r\n\r\nThe Complete Manual of Typography\r\nby
  James Felici\r\n\r\nStop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works, Second Edition\r\nby
  Erik Spiekermann and E.M Ginger\r\n\r\nMaking and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design
  Layout Workshop\r\nby Timothy Samara\r\n\r\nA final note: all the books look interesting,
  but (a) it's difficult to judge them when you can't flip through them and see what
  they contain, and (b) I have no idea about the credibility of the authors.\r\n\r\nAny
  advice would be most appreciated.  I apologise for the long post - particularly
  seeing as it's my first! :)"

  body: '<em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> by Robert Bringhurst really is
    one of the VERY BEST books you''ll ever find on typography and design. It discusses
    basics, history, page layout, proper terminology, "the rules" of good typography
    and even has a meaty specimen section in the back. It should be required reading
    for all designers. '

  body: "Marc\r\nTwo books I can't live without - The Elements of Typographic Style
    by Robert Bringhurst (you mention this one) and Letters of Credit by Walter Tracy.
    Stop Stealing Sheep is very good, Type & Typography is excellent. The Lupton books
    are always good. For history and examples the always popular can't live without
    it type of book, no pun intended, is Jaspert, Berry & Johnson, Encyclopaedia of
    Type Faces, Blandford, 1993, I hope still in print. I also like About Face - Reviving
    the rules of typography by David Jury, RotoVision, 2002. Finally, not really,
    a great one, Language, Culture, Type edited by John Berry, published by ATYpI/Graphis,
    2002, and Dutch Type by Jan Middendorp, 010 publishers, Rotterdam, 2004, pricey,
    but worth it. If I had to pick one from these, stranded on a desert island, it
    would be the Berry book. As long as I had a writing implement and a piece of parchment
    with me, and a tropical fruit or two.\r\nHave fun\r\nJordan\r\n"
