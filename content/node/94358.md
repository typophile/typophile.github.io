  the author's name condensed or that's just the way the typeface was designed? And
  what's with the non-closing P letterform?\r\n\r\nThank you all in advance!"

  body: Strikingly similar, yes. But why would anyone squoosh such a classic typeface?
    The all-around proportions seem somehow... well, distorted. And I am, by no means,
    a fussy classicist.
