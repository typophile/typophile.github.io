  body: TANNING has some resemblance to Nick Curtis&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/lance-corporal-nf/lance-corporal-nf/"
    target="_blank">Lance Corporal</a>, but only seems to be a possible &#39;inspiration&#39;.
    Note how the N could be created by removing the right stem and squooshing.
