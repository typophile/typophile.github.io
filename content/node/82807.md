    i think you have a good point about the footnotes.

  body: If you're working with a style guide, consult that.  But I usually just treat
    them as regular text.  If you feel  that this will confuse the reader, you could
    make them bold or italic to help visually separate them from the other text. Or
    you could underline, but as Frank said that can cause problems.

  body: "> converted to a TinyURL \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how long TInyURL (and similar
    services) guarantee that their links will work, so I'd be hesitant to put them
    in a printed document if it's going to be in use for a while.\r\n\r\nBut I agree
    with your general point that long URLs can be a problem in non-clickable text.
    For that reason I generally try to avoid printing URLs when I can, and if I must
    use them I try to make them as short as possible. \r\n\r\nFor example, instead
    of saying \"go to http://www.company.com/support/support.html\" say something
    like \"go to the support section of www.company.com\"."

  body: "Won't a very low underline collide with the next line?\r\n\r\nTinyURL only
    \"translates\" the link, so it will work as long as: the target is still around;
    TinyURL is still around! Some other services actually keep a copy of your target
    (which might sometimes be illegal I guess) so the first requirement is gone, but
    AFAIK they require some form of \"commitment\" (like money :-). You could always
    host a reference link on a site you control; more work, but at least the link
    will still be around as long as you want it. Or as long as the Internet is around.

    If one puts them as footnotes there's less reason to use a monospace font, although
    a font with distinct I/l/1 etc. is still very important (which of course is another
    reason to switch fonts when embedding in text). BTW, besides nicely marking visual
    contrast a monospace font is great for conveying a computery flavor.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
