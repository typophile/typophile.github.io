body: "Do you usually stick with the typeface your client use in their previously-designed-by-someone-else-logo
  when creating additional material? I am of the opinion that a good logotype needs
  more than just typing the company name in a font you conveniently had installed,
  and that it is equally important how it relates to the other material in terms of
  colour, composition and type choice. However, there are many designers in the business
  that doesn\u2019t. \r\n\r\nIn this case, I\u2019m doing a website job were the logo
  is set in tightly spaced all caps FB Antenna. I\u2019ve been looking at Etelka as
  an option, but I\u2019m not really sure if I should abandon Antenna, even though
  I have my reasons to do so."

  body: "I used to use the same typeface for logo and other identity elements, such
    as advertising, etc.\r\nNowadays I much prefer to settle with a different typeface.
    Possibly one that create an harmonious contrast with the one of the logo. This
    helps to not dilute the wordmark."

    brand identity guidelines, that you just <em>have to follow.</em>

  body: "I\u2019m allowed to choose another font, but the logo will remain set in
    Antenna. The original designer suggested I\u2019d try something less square. I
    guess this is the reason why I\u2019m asking: I would generally never pair two
    different sans designs, but the logo is only one word. "
