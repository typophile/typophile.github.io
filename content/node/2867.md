  body: For what help it gives, the movie was in 1973. So I&#39;d say we&#39;re hunting
    for a film type, not a font. My Photo-Lettering book is too old for this &#40;I
    have Vol 2 &amp; 3 on order&#41;, so someone else will have to hunt. I checked
    the Solotype Catalog, and no luck there.

  body: Thanks Mike and Cheshire. My interest in this type is not for a new project,
    but to recreate the title and credits exactly. If I can&#39;t do that with a digital
    font I guess my next best plan will be to find a source &#40;type book or ?&#41;
    that can be scanned. Ah, back to cut and paste. Any more suggestions?

  body: My type library isn&#39;t so extensive that I can say I have books about the
    types of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, which is what I think you need. You might
    try Googling or using AbeBooks  to search for books with those keywords, or seek
    out a good library with a graphic arts section. For some reason this era seems
    to be one that the Solotype Catalog doesn&#39;t have very much for. If someone
    else here has some of the newer phototype catalogs, that might help, but the maddening
    thing is that many of those books don&#39;t have full alphabets. <BR> <BR>Why
    not just scan and digitize this, if this is the only thing you are replicating?
    You only need these letters, right?

  body: Good eye Mark!  There are only 17 different letters &#40;if I counted right&#41;
    in your movie lettering, so digitizing those wouldn&#39;t be too bad, I presume.
    &#40;Not my area of expertise&#41;.

    and there is a font called &#34;West Fifth Dimension&#34; that is  quite similar
    in its blockiness and feel, to your sample, but it is &#40;alas&#41; not identical,
    and of course, probably not a digitized font. <BR>Here is a scan of it: <BR><img

  body: Alyce, there are too many to scan them all. Most of the recognizable ones
    are fat-bottomed, inflated looking things. A google search for 60&#39;s or 70&#39;s
    typefaces might do as well as I could attempt. <BR> <BR>I know Leslie Cabarga
    has done some &#40;see <a href="http://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage2.htm"
    target="_blank">this page</a> for Grassy Knoll and some others that are in the
    &#39;genre&#39; of your sample&#41;.
