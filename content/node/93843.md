    a thread about censorship! The above piece i did as a comment on just such a topic.\r\n\r\nCensorship
    is a brutal action, especially the documents we  typically see coming out from
    our respective governments. They seem to me to be even more aggressive because
    it is the people's business that is being censored. \r\n\r\nA blackened out censored
    document is also in some ways a act of appropriation. Whatever was meant not for
    our eyes has been appropriated. \r\n\r\nn."
