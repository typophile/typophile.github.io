body: "The Tugra is a fantastic calligraphic device. It was invented by Uthmani calligraphers
  to represent the seal of the Uthmani Sultan. However, it is now used for various
  sorts of calligraphic representations such as Quranic script, signatures, and logos.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tugrapagesmall_5761.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  an [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/tugra/|article on the Tugra]], I
  demonstrate how non-Arabs have contributed to the Arabic script, particularly in
  the refinement of the Thuluth calligraphic style and the invention of the Tugra
  by the Uthmani Turks. I also try to show the origins of the shape of the Turga and
  analyze its visual characteristics. Finally, I show the impact of the Tugra on the
  design of modern logos such as that used by Al-Jazerra and by Bahrain TV.\r\n\r\nI
  try to include some goodies with my blog entries, and this article includes a vector-based
  drawing of a Tugra in Adobe Illustrator format and an example of its usage with
  Arabic type in a PDF file. Both files are [[http://www.automason.com/download/tugra.zip|freely
  available for download and experimentation]].\r\n"

  body: Hello Khalid,  I have been trying to trace this Tugra and cannot see that
    it belongs to any of the Turkish sultans.  Do you know whose Tugra it is?  Thank
    you very much!

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nYou know, I just saw your comment now after more than a year.
      Yikes!\r\n\r\nI am so sorry. I take pride in being responsive and it makes me
      feel sad that I have not replied to this request in time.\r\n\r\nThis site has
      to take some of the responsibility, though. For some reason it has blocked my
      blog contributions on the site. I sent for their clarification, but none bothered
      to respond. If it was because I'm using this site with too many references to
      my own blog, promoting my personal blog in a sense, at least they could have
      openly told me. All this has turned me away and I rarely visit this site anymore.
      (Once in a few years as you can see.)\r\n\r\nMy second apology about this long
      text, but I do feel I owe you an explanation.\r\n\r\nFinally, what tugra are
      you referring to? If it's the one I posted, it is no sultan's tugra. It is a
      calligraphic representation of the Qur'anic aya: \"\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647
      \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062D\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062D\u064A\u0645\",
      the first aya in the mushaf. The name of the calligraphist is Mustafa Hamid.\r\n\r\nBest
      regards,\r\n\r\nKhalid\r\n"
