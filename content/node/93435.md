body: "Fine people, \r\n\r\nI'm designing an online magazine about the web. We are
  going to publish articles on usability, design, code, content and web strategy.
  \r\n\r\nThe design should be invisible enough to allow for a flexible reading environment
  where illustrations can really pop.\r\n\r\nI've been playing with Meta Serif, and
  while I think it works amazingly well for body type (15px and 13px), I'm not sure
  to use it for the headings. I need something that doesn't look so neutral, something
  that could add a touch of distinction and emphasis, while not being so aggresive
  and still easy on the eyes. So I've been coining Adelle.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts
  on this pairing? Do you think it could work? Any feedback will be really appreciated!\r\n\r\nP.S.
  Illustrations by Kevin Cornell used only in internal mockups as placeholders. "

    that\u2019s my Dutch background speaking up, I guess."
