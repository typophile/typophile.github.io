  body: This is pretty interesting. <BR>Some of the shapes need a bit of taming &#40;like
    the &#34;4&#34;&#41; but I would actually emphasise the ambiguity overall; specifically
    I&#39;d increase the &#34;componental&#34; aspect, for example how the &#34;B&#34;
    is a bracket plus a &#34;3&#34;. I think you can get an interesting texture with
    a line of type set in a font like that. <BR> <BR>The other thing is that the numerals
    are slanted in an otherwise upright alphabet. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Sophia, <BR>I love it! An uncial font built on some of the shapes of Courier!
    <BR>Like Hrant, I would take a look at the numbers and make them more vertical.
    The M and W feel a little squeezed to me in a font that is so open and airy--would
    you consider widening them a bit? <BR>Otherwise, a great hybrid combining a very
    old historical script with a stereotypically modern typestyle--I look forward
    to seeing how it develops! Keep up the great work. <BR>--Murray
