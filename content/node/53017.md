body: What's making me the craziest is the fact that I did this on about a dozen fonts
  last month, and I can't for the life of me recall how to do it again. I need to
  convert a series of Type 1 fonts to TTF format for use on a companion PC using FontLab
  4.6. I thought there was something in the Tools bar, but can't seem to find the
  right one. I don't own or have a reason to buy TransType, so anyone with some help
  would be much appreciated. Thank you!

    a Python script.
