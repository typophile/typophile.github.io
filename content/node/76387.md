    Pro.\r\nMaison fondee - Friz Quadrata.\r\nCOLIER maybe some version of Perpetua."

  body: "I am fascinated by this heavy wedge serif for \"SPARKLING\". It's too far
    from <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/warnock_pro_complete_pack/?affid=99346\">Warnock</a>.
    I\u2019ve seen that 'R' (close to Vendome), 'L', and 'U' before."
