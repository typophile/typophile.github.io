  for the church I work at. I'm curious what people think \u2013 whether I've improved
  (or dis-improved) the logo. \r\n\r\nMine's on top, set in an Eisner+Flake Giovanni
  small caps (with serifs tweaked a bit)."

  body: "Well, from a no-more-faux-small-caps perspective, yours is certainly better.
    I want the shield/crest to be bigger, as it is in the original. I just prefer
    the balance, particularly in light of the added weight. Also, the 'W' could stand
    to snuggle up to the 'N' just a bit. Perhaps you could to a little custom work
    on the join where the serifs will overlap?\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it's a subtle
    improvement, unless the client doesn't like the heavier feel of the type. I admit
    I prefer the weight of the bottom version, other issues aside. But that's a matter
    of personal taste."
