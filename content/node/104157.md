  body: Thanks for the help Mr. Ryuk but it's similar but not exactly the same. I
    need is the exact replica of the font in the image.

      what it looks like.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CCC Aphrodite_6065.png]

  body: It's because you're using [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/aphrodite-pro/contextual/|Aphrodite
    Contextual]]. Switch to the regular version and that'd be ok.

  body: The first image is the font that I'm looking for. The second image is the
    Aphrodite font that I've used. As you all can see sirs, there are a lot of difference
    between the fonts used. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CCC Difference_5265.png]

  body: It is Aphrodite like Ryuk says - you might want to check your computer settings
    - they could be changing it.
