body: "So this is a dabbler's question: what do y'all use to look at a font, as individual
  glyphs rather than as sample text? In particular, what do you do if you want an
  overview of say fleurons or similar odds-and-ends that don't show up easily in a
  standard sample text?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI've bought an ampersand font (Coming Together,
  a charity offering with proceeds to Doctors Without Borders) and don't really know
  what to do with it. I need a comfortable way to see all them ampersands! Ideally
  I would like to print a sample of all the glyphs the font provides, along with their
  codepoints.\r\n\r\nI've found some apps that do almost what I want, but not quite.
  (This is the point to mention that I run linux and --since this is just for my own
  amusement-- I'm not looking to spend any money. Although I'd be interested to hear
  if there are non-free solutions, even if I'm unlikely to use one myself.)\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>fontforge
  shows the entire unicode table, with empty cells where the font doesn't provide
  a glyph. Not so handy for this one because the glyphs are spread out all over the
  place, so there's lots of useless empty cells cluttering up the view.</li>\r\n<li>\r\nkfontview
  gives a very nice view of all-and-only the glyphs, but doesn't tell me how to access
  them (no codepoint information); my print button also seems to be disabled.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>scribus
  has a \"font catalog\" script, but that just does quick-brown-fox sample text. I
  could laboriously figure out the letters whose codepoints these ampersands are usurping
  and construct a sample text, but I'm lazy. And again, the printed output doesn't
  include those codepoints.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIs there some tool I'm missing?
  Or am I just going about it all the wrong way?"

    further, and I find also some print options that do most of what I need. (No codepoints
    included afaics, but I can print the pretty stuff and look up the details on-screen.)\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nTikitu"
