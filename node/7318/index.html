  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all new to the forums here looks like a great resource!  I will tell you all a little about myself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just got started doing layout for a small town newspaper.  Its tabloid size paper and it runs 20 pages.  I am fairly new to newspaper layout and I am into my fifth issue now but I am loving the learning process.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So now I have a contract with a non-profit organization to do a monthly senior paper. &quot;Supposedly&quot; I am working with a man that will deliver all of the copy and pictures to me at or near the end of the month and then all I do is the layout.  Seeing the will be the first issue that remains to be seen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So when we had a meeting he mentioned that he would like to see a 3 column format.  Instead of a 4.  I also suggested arial font because old people will need to easily read it. I was thinking something larger like 12 point. He also said he would like to run at least 26 pages. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I guess I am looking for some work flow tips, maybe some suggestions on paper layout anything really. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is my first post here so if I left anything out please dont hestiate to respond. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh ya I use InDesign CS for my layout program.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If this person wants it to be readable, and suggested Arial, they don't know much about text and readability. With its relatively closed counterforms, Arial tends to be harder to read by those with poor eyesight than, well, lots of things. If you and he are convinced that a sans serif is the way to go, use a more humanist sans with more open counterforms. Frutiger and Myriad come to mind, but there are many other choices. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A couple of things came to mind as I read your post: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Arial is not a great choice for body copy. For the kind of longish stories that a newspaper typically carries, a serif typeface is generally considered a better (more readable) choice. Times New Roman started life as a newspaper &quot;font&quot; &ndash; if your type options are limited, pick Times over Arial. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- If the senior paper is also a tabloid, then a 3-column layout may yield columns that are too wide for comfortable, quick reading. Even with the larger type size you're proposing, a 4-, 5- or even 6-column approach might work better. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Are you familiar with the Society of Newspaper Designers? Among other things, they publish a design annual that might be a good source for inspiration. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.snd.org">http://www.snd.org</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Mario Garcia is a well-known newspaper designer who recently published a book on the topic called &quot;Pure Design.&quot; Lots of basic, useful information. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0972469605/qid=1098684488/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-0823421-5853518?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0972469605/qid=1098684488/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-0823421-5853518?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Workflow tips: Before you start production on the first issue set up style sheets and master pages for the publication. Consider having all of your text (heads, decks, etc.) use leading that is a multiple of the body copy's leading, and have everything snap to the baseline grid. (This can be set up as part of the style sheet.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hopefully some of the other publication designers that frequent these parts will chime in with more suggestions. Good luck!</div>

Unless you can print single, 2-sided sheets, newspapers, especially tabloids, are made up of spreads printed front and back and folded in the middle.

If the printing press can print 2 of those signatures at the same time, they would be folded in the middle and trimmed in the press (it you</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The &quot;official&quot; Arial recommendations are indeed not surprising, and it's due to the confounding of legibility/deliberative_reading versus readability/immersive_reading. And although typographic practioners don't [seem to] have enough answers either, one thing they can certainly do is alert the field scientists that something is very wrong. These two worlds are what some of us have been trying to reconcile, to fuse together what they know best; the best attempt so far was this year's Thessaloniki conference. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
