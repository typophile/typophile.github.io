  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>so&hellip;here i am&hellip;BLOGGING! never thought it would happen, but some situation has urged me to act and to stand up for those who rather take the professional road and not comment on your nasty statements. here is what i blogged on the forum you all so lovingly created ([[http://typophile.com/node/55930]])&hellip;i shall echo my own sentiments:</p>
<p>May I just say, that as a student being targeted by this forum, our professors are not just “collecting a paycheck” nor our we just doing this for the “brownie points”. Our professors are merely trying to widen our horizons in the communicative and digital media regarding the art of typography. We are using this blog, yes as output for homework assignments, but we are also currently preparing work to be constructively critiqued by all you professionals. Constructive criticism is the best, no? I must admit that I am guilty of “posting and running”, as Michael so cleverly put it, but with every passing class day, our professors inspire us to do more [we are only 1st year students, just so you understand]. It has come to our attention, that when an assignment is due, we do “flood” the “Newest” forum, and for that we apologize, for our intentions are not to do so. I was just like to assure you all that our professors are not only instructing us in the art of graphic design, but also exposing us to different kinds of media, such as this blog. We have an amazing collection of professors who we are all very lucky to be learning from. Please do not insult the teaching methods of our professors [none of you are in the classroom with us, therefore none of you can truly begin to understand their motivation behind the assignments like we students can]. I do understand how you all would want us to have a separate “Student Forum”, but I would also like to echo DanGayle’s sentiments and concur that I would feel that the forum would make it hard if not impossible for professionals to view and constructively critique our work. But, some organization and content filtering is need. Well, that is all I have to say about that. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Peace,
Gabi</p>

<p>My only comment has been said once before and I want to repeat it. If the project description were given with the post then we would have more information and would be able to make better judgment and or just comments. Yes, there has been some flooding. But I think it felt more like a flood because there wasn&rsquo;t, again, information given along with the post.</p>
<p>It would be much more interesting to see all of the projects in the same thread where some comparison could be drawn. This would make it similar to a classroom critique.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Very good suggestions, Miss Tiffany. We did speak with our professors on the matter, and they have the same sentiment: to write a description of the project. So, I believe you will be seeing this from now on. As for the thread, that is also a good idea. I&rsquo;m sure our professors are on that as well. Thank you for your constructive comments!</div>

<p>We have no clue as to what they are teaching you. We can merely form an opinion based on what is being posted and, more specifically, how it&rsquo;s being posted. BASED ON THAT, there is plenty to be skeptical of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said many times already&hellip;no one is attacking you, the students. We&rsquo;re just a tad irritated by your professors' lack of netiquette.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all, Jessica, a fellow student, <strong> was </strong> attacked, so there goes that argument.</p>
<p>Secondly, what are the terms of netiquette?  I am not going to lie, I have never heard of it until I read it the other day. But just out of observation, I am guessing it has nothing to do with common courtesy, nor the notion of being polite instead of being purposefully and <em>unnecessarily</em> harsh or cruel. Please enlighten those who you obviously think are oblivious to the phrase, so we can behave in a more appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the means as to which our assignments are being posted is the fault of us, the students, for not explaining ourselves well enough, and does not reflect on the education being provided by our professors. Trust me when I say there is <strong><em> nothing </em></strong> to be skeptical of. And if you all are <em> truly </em> concerned with our education, you need not be, for we are receiving the best education the gulf coast has to offer. And if you are <em>unsure,</em> voicing that in rude was is not helping the &ldquo;situation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And fourthly, these posts, while open to everyone to comment on [and we do appreciate the fact that you all take out the time to critique our work], are <strong><em>blogs!</em></strong> I mean, I understand that blogs in general are for passionate people looking for a way to express themselves, but is it constructive or helping <strong>anyone</strong> when cruel remarks are being shared and exchanged?! I really don&rsquo;t understand what everyone is getting so upset about. I am defending the reputation of my fellow classmates and professors, but is it <em>really</em> such a huge burden on everyone?! I mean&hellip;seriously?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are too many threads to keep up with, but again I will say WE HAVE A PLAN. :)</p>
<p>Everyone calm down and be patient. Gabi, the community is having a difficult time with this because suddenly the forums are being bombarded by unstructured threads which lack the information necessary to allow people to interact with the content and you (the author). This isn&rsquo;t necessarily the fault of the students, and part of the problem might be the underlying architecture of the site and the way in which we handle and surface content. Blogs have never been an integral part of Typophile and not so long ago, only paying members of the site used them. And really, no one used them until we opened it up to everyone.</p>
<p>Surfacing blogs is a new thing here. It has become very popular in a short amount of time and is now causing us to re-think how the system needs to function, and how people use them. There isn&rsquo;t anything wrong with the way in which your class is utilizing this feature, as a matter of fact it is quite interesting and proposes some new opportunities. But it will require organization to do this in a more engaging way.</p>
<p>No one here don&rsquo;t dislikes students, and I apologize if our nastier community members are making your experiences at Typophile unpleasant. We are communicating with the instructors involved and will be proposing ideas to help solve some of these problems and promote collaboration and dialogue instead of negative criticism.</p>
<p>If you have any direct complaints or want more information, feel free to contact me directly. zara [at] punchcut [dot] com</p>
<p>Thanks,
Zara</p>
