    non-typographic thread. Now, you could have pointed out my reaction to Paul Cutler's
    thread as being inadvisably nice. But that still doesn't make starting this thread
    OK.\r\n\r\nBTW, anybody who believes voting matters very much needs a nanny.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    citizens are truly oppressed, are truly kept down by tyrants who simply fear the
    power of democracy then perhaps you might appreciate your right to vote a little
    more.\r\n\r\nBut then again perhaps not, perhaps you believe in a all-powerful
    dictatorship.\r\n\r\nApathy is not an option.\r\n\r\n\r\nn. "

  body: "@n. Ack! Not another sig!! You do realize it just makes for longer scrolls,
    and actually provides readers with no information. We know your name if we click
    on your profile (Paul and I have already had this discussion). Or, you could change
    your screen name. In the old days, it was considered polite to use your real name,
    and it often resulted in people taking you more seriously and giving greater respect.
    Food for thought.\r\n\r\n(I neglected pasting my entire profile here as a sig,
    even though it would save you a click ;)"

    a call and ask them how they feel about watching Obama redistribute their wealth.\r\n\r\nk?\r\n\r\nAsk
    the guy/gal who fought tooth and nail their whole lives, paid with their lives,
    for their yearly earning to rise above 250k ... ask them how they feel about being
    under pressure for earning to much money!\r\n\r\nk?\r\n\r\nWith one hand you want
    to celebrate all that is great with America - with the other hand you want to
    slap 'em with a plan to take their wealth.\r\n\r\nOne day you're thanking your
    lucky stars for living in an awesome democracy and the next day you show respect
    for those went off to die for your liberty by saying you care to much to vote.\r\n\r\nSo...\r\n\r\nLet
    me see if I can wrap this up ... sit around and take money from those who are
    successful and then sit around some more on election day.\r\n\r\nCrazy times indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nn."

    which you are!\r\n\r\n If you want to criticise, know at the same time that Obama
    is a MODERATE democrat judging by the spectrum of politics from redistribution
    on one side to a simple \u201Cguardian state\u201D one the other end of the scale.
    This compared internationally to present time and as well to the USA throughout
    the history of post 1945. And then discuss on that basis. "

    'Collective'.\r\n\r\nFrom most everything I've seen coming from Obama (including
    the 2 years he squandered majority in both the house and senate) is that he is
    of the 'collective' ... and seems to have a complete disdain for the what and
    why America is/became the greatest nation on earth.  \r\n\r\nAmerica is NOT a
    'collective' ... it's a nation of individuals with far reaching rights for and
    of the individual ... it's NOT a nation of far reaching rights for and of the
    'collective'. \r\n\r\nI don't want anybody's money given to me. As an individual
    I want to earn my worth ... therefore I want a government to represent the Individual.
    Lay out the environment whereby I can create my wealth. Do you guys even understand
    the difference?\r\n\r\nObama creates new taxes simply to redistribute the wealth
    of the successful individuals.\r\n\r\nThis election is about The Collective vs.
    The Individual.\r\n\r\nSo ya ... of course America appears upside-down to you
    hrant and to all your redistribution socialist guardian collectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nn."

    individuals (including Obama, Romney, or whoever else). We do live in collectives
    (AKA societies, including one big one on this planet - America, shmamerica), and
    collectively we're ruining everything. The first step is admitting it.\r\n\r\nThis
    election is about the same thing every modern election has been about: fooling
    the peons (including you) into thinking they have a choice so the rich can get
