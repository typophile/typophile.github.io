  to offer this restaurant logo for critique. The project is already complete, and
  I'd neglected to seek feedback along the way, so try not to be <em>too</em> harsh.\r\n\r\nThe
  name and grammar had already been set in stone - nothing I could do about that -
  the job was to set it in type and add any additional elements I felt were appropriate
  or necessary. The underscore and dot are a hint at a morse-code 'k' as the owner's
  name also begins with that letter (and it's their first business venture) so I wanted
  to make a reference that may hold some personal significance.\r\n\r\nI'm about to
  press 'Save' with trepidation..."

  body: "I like it. No need to be trepid :)\r\n\r\nThere is, however, some sharpness
    and angularity in the type while there is softness in the underscore and dot.
    Some further honing of the letterforms could have been done, I think, to bring
    them both into a better harmony.\r\n\r\nBut overall it feels nice.\r\n\r\n<em>penn</em>"

  body: I agree that there needs to be more connection between the type and the ornament.
    The only thing that bothers me about the logo is the imbalance of the bottom serifs
    of the "r." Other than that, it looks great.

    and, in hindsight, I do tend to agree with the consensus. I'll definitely be returning
    to this forum - hopefully with something to add one day, not just to receive."
