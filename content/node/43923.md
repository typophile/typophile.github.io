    of weights of Futura and Helvetica (Neue) come <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307069\">bundled
    with Mac OSX</a>.\r\nFor Univers, check out the package Thomas has linked to above.
    For single weights, have a look at this <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/familytree.html\">overview
    at MyFonts</a>; there is quite a number of versions available.\r\nF"

  body: Adobe's student/educator essentials package is a great starter library for
    $149, so much so that *anyone* starting their type library should be able to find
    out about it and buy it. I never knew about it until now, so maybe it should be
    mentioned more visibly, like on the Adobe fonts home page. Freelancers turning
    to graphic design without benefit of art school (and there are many of us) can
    then buy it for themselves instead of stealing shareware fonts.

  body: "That's a great package, Thomas. Something tells me you were involved in its
    creation. It will be much more useful for graphic arts courses than the old package,
    which seemed to be filled with display faces. The latter might be appealing to
    el-hi students, but there was a dearth of good faces for general work in it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thomas, I went to check out the educators package, and noticed that Adobe's
    Kepler offering specifically excludes "a few faces that don't exist." This outrageous
    omission renders the entire offer valueless; until Adobe includes the typefaces
    that don't exist, I'm withholding my $149.
