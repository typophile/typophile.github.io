  minimalist flavor; however, I am wondering if anyone could recommend a typeface
  with similar attributes to the Campbell&#39;s soup can script. If possible, please
  pass along a website with type face recommendation. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Steven

    has asked me to ID the Campbell's Soup logo and my research shows it must have
    been a custom job (possibly by Paul Shaw?). Can anyone suggest a typeface that
    has similar characteristics?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/s2s/latest/art2/src/proj/Art/pop_art/Warhol_Tomato.jpg\">\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nPAUL
