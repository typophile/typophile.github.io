  to help me out and tell me about the paper stock used here: http://img158.yfrog.com/img158/1065/6gkv.jpg.\r\n\r\nReally
  any information would help. Who makes it or something like it....even if you just
  know what that kind of paper is called so I can figure out what to search for.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    would show it to a printer or a paper sales person, or go through their samples."

  body: Yeah it's definitely letter press. According to his twitter it was done by
    Mandate Press so maybe they could help, but yeah specifically I was referring
    to the edge color. Perhaps I'll shoot him an email. Thanks again for the help.
