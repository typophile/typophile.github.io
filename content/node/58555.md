body: "I have a project where I have to strip in an obscene amount of legalese onto
  a ticket. Think 3-4 pts. It will be printed on an offset press. I know that I am
  asking the impossible but is there any font out there that has any chance of printed
  cleanly at this size? If it could be read with really strong reading glasses (or
  by Superman) it would be a major victory.\r\n\r\nI am thinking condensed sans of
  some type. I will need a book and bold weight in both standard and italic.\r\n\r\nThe
  character of the font is not important other than it's ability to be read smaller
  than anything should ever be printed.\r\n\r\ntia\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: An agate is what you want. Christian Schwartz's Amplitude Wide Regular is
    a good choice, but there are other similar faces. Miniscule is in my opinion way
    too quirky for mainstream use. In any case the printing quality has to be anno
    the beginning of the twentieth century to make it gel. And I'm sorry to say that
    Michael's Pseudo is not very legible in small sizes, but it does look rather smart
    in normal sizes and up.

    to be a hairline rule, but when viewed at 8x magnification it can be read clearly.
    I used .75 pt. Helvetica Neue 55, and ran plates at 4,000 dpi.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    I used to work for Siegel+Gale, who specialized in both corporate identity and
    legal-language simplification; the law in some states (here in the U.S.) requires
    that legal language must be above a certain point size for some consumer contracts
    (a ticket might be an example) to be binding."

  body: "I have a growing appreciation for ITC Weidemann. It takes the narrow route
    and is pretty mono-linear in its construction. It uses its otherwise neutral frame
    so as to promote the potency of the \u2018thorn\u2019 like serif structures which
    are cleverly used for the lowercase letters r and f. The basic innovation for
    Weidemann is that consideration has gone into pre-empting cases of resemblance
    and subtle design decisions were taken to lesson the effects of misreading text
    when small. Optical concerns have not followed to the Bold, where the design just
    gets fatter. I guess the text weight is where its at for this font."

    @eliason, so young girls vs more chiselled men?\r\n@clauses. You're right this
    wasn't what I was thinking at the time.\r\nThis may not be one of the criterion
    to appreciate legibility, though a good analogy of optical shifts.\r\nI do believe
    that the text needs to be comfortable at the desired size. A feminine aspect might
    be good for this?\r\nConsider though...  unlike sharp edges...\r\nThe rounded
    features may not actually go further out of focus.\r\nThe fact that the shape
    is malleable means that the design can be manipulated to counteract optical effects.\r\nThis
    is the concept of the 'air traps' otherwise called 'gauges' and 'scrapings'. additional
    to the fact that those counters will gain 5% in size because of the manipulation
    (before any adjustments to extenders or horizontal scaling).\r\nDon't discard
    the concept yet. It might just need someone to try a variant or for me to do a
    fine tune on the e and g which I will concede might need a little more thought.\r\n\r\n@clauses.
    I should mention that what you saw was actually a text weight variant which I
    was trying out my experiments. I have since worked on a rough version of the Footnote
    variant which is further optimised for small scale applications. It has been particularly
    fascinating problem solving the Bold weight of the Footnote which itself has a
    similar density to a Text weight Bold. A Bold of a Bold if you will?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ekusupo/3891092610/sizes/o//|Pseudo
    Text vs Pseudo Footnote]]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso... @clauses. What principles are you
    using in your font as I thought it looked *great* small?"
