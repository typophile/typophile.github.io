body: "For the U+0334 to U+0338 Combining overlays, what is the prefered placement
  (or is there any?).  Besides most fonts not really including them, it seems like
  those that do have either followed two rules in their placement irrespective of
  the form of the letters to be placed on.  Eithe A- they remain at a consistent height
  both for letters with and without ascenders, or they are placed at exactly one half
  the total height of the character (making different heights for dotted and dotless
  lowercase I).\r\n\r\nIn both cases, a number of letters end up with basically invisible
  overlays, most especially those non-ascending letters with horizontal strokes in
  the middle (two-tier A, S, E).  While I'm sure these are basically unused combinations,
  I wonder, what would the best placement options be for such a hypothetical character?
  \ \r\n\r\nHere's the three options I see for a two-tier A, and in all situations
  at least one of them appears nearly identical to the original.  Maybe if each of
  the overlays has a very light negative outline?  (not sure if you can have diacritics
  \"chop out\" their base glyphs anyways)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overlaying_diacritics_test_4748.png]"

    the most annoying part of them is simply adding in yet another connection point
    to Every. Single. Letter. but, since I doubt anyone is ever really going to use
    it I was more asking the question as one of those academic theoretical hypothetical
    questions :)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos

  body: Yeah, those overlays make only sense with specific letters, and I think one
    should create specific glyphs for those letter+overlay combinations which are
    targeted. They are of interest of very specific user groups and IMHO concern only
    for special fonts created with the respective user bases in mind. Once you design
    such a commission, you clearly can consult them on their placing preference.

  body: "Miguel, I did read the information, but I only considered that as a practical
    reason not to include them, not a technical reason.  To me, a technical reason
    would be that (for instance) they were not coded as a combining diacritic and
    thus couldn't be combined without manual user placement, or that programs ignored
    their codepoints or something of that sort. \r\n\r\nMy understanding of the reason
    that they are not decomposed in Unicode is because they reside in the IPA section,
    where each codepoint is considered a letter.  Looking at the code chart you see
    that none of the IPA characters decompose, not even the two-letter combinations,
    whereas elsewhere digraphs are decomposed as normally would be:\r\n\r\n0167 LJ
    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER LJ\r\n\u2248 004C L OO4A J\r\n\r\nBUT\r\n\r\n02A4 \u02A3
    LATIN SMALL LETTER DZ DIGRAPH\r\n\xB7 voiced dental affricate\r\n\r\nThe DZ digraph
    isn't aliased as a DZ ligature, as in the case of the AE lig, in effect is and
    always is a single letter within phonetic transcription, same as an l with combining
    tilde overlay.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I recognize they're hardly ever used, I'm looking
    at it as a practice in design/balance than a practice in practicality.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
