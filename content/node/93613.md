  to have lost all information in a hard drive crash about what font I used and my
  backup files and everything. Any help would be great!\r\n\r\nI know that when choosing
  the font I was looking for something that resembled a late 1890's/early 1900's French
  style font. And I MAY have gotten the font from dafont.com, although I cannot seem
  to find it browsing around on their website. \r\n\r\nHere is a link to my website
  where my logo is clearly visible in the upper left of the page:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thelumierebrothers.com]]"
