<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>The type community has a variety of means for testing characters - pangrams, brute force testing, language based character frequency lists ( and words ), all of which are good, but I may have thought of another wrinkle. No doubt others have preceded me if it's a good idea (or perhaps it's a silly one), but in any event:
What do you think of making a shared Unicode text file that has words made to highlight a glyph in use? It's purpose could extend to kerning etc but the emphasis I want to give the list is aesthtic and and to a certain extent cultural and linguistic.
So for example for C, I think Cancer & CANCER are quite good. These two forms of the word seem like an elegant and concise way of examining if you like the way the C & c in your font looks. For Cap W I think WAVE, Wave, LAWYER, Lawyer would be good ones to use. The idea being that when a glyph has cases where it fits well and also where it sometimes fits poorly ideally they should both be presented. It would probably be good to have 3-5 words in each case to allow for a variety of aesthetic issues and combinational issues like double letters, round vs. flat neighbor glyphs and position in the word as well. So for C again maybe we would have cc: (the contaction), PINOCCHIO, Pinocchio, as well as a word with c At the end like ZINC, Zinc. And maybe one or two more.
The real reason I started thinking like this has nothing to do the glyphs used in English. Instead, I started thinking about this when I was looking at glyphs whose diacritics seemed especially aesthetically challenging because of their novelty. And what I wanted to see was a word that used them so I could start to build aesthetic context. Of course it would be good to have samples of the glyphs in use to look at too but what I want to have words which highlight the aesthetic concerns for glyphs like: ẗ, ť, ǻ Ǻ and ď etc. Ideally someone from or well versed in the cuture or cultures that use the glyph would give the examples.
Let me know if these last glyphs don't render for you. They were: latin small letter t with diaeresis, latin small letter t with caron, latin small letter a with ring above and acute, latin capital letter a with ring above and acute, and latin small letter d with caron.
Does something like this exist already?
Obviously there is
http://diacritics.typo.cz/
and
http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=10
Which will continue to improve (and provide in-use examples) which is excellent!
But for the purposes of testing my fonts I would like to go further and have a text file like the one I have described as well!
What do you think?</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Tiffany Wardle mentioned that she tries setting her full name in the type as a test, not out of vanity, because it shows how the characters work.
Generalizing this, I find that a good aesthetic test is to set proper names in the type, perferably somebody you know and respect, either current or historical.
Somehow the emotional weight of a proper name, and thinking of it on a letter head or sign makes the success or failure of the glyphs more obvious. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Well it might be a little bit to do with vanity. :^/ But I always look for the double-f ligature as well as how the Ti and Wa have been kerned. If those three things are there it shows a certain level of attention to detail. IMHO</div>

Bill, Tiff:
Does my distinction re: aesthetics vs kerning value work for you or not really? Maybe I should rephrase. I thought the word 'cancer' was an excellent test word not just because it has a 'c' at the beginning & in the middle but because it does a good job of showing the 'c-ness' of the c's used in it. Perhaps I am just being odd. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, I don't know. To me it's important to put a letter between both straight and round letters to see how it relates. You can use all kinds of words for the goal here, like 'rhythm' and 'color' and 'notan', but this is all about getting the letters to work together. To me there's an additional 'pizzaz' factor, which is that it doesn't only work, but brings some beauty or excitement or authority to the words.
I switch back and forth between faces, comparing the same name in the Preview Panel in my typeface and in other type faces I admire. This is a humbling experience! When mine starts to look better to me, in some respects anyway, I figure I'm getting somewhere. </div>

Generally fonts don’t look as good when you set Finnish with them compared to English. Finnish sentences contain long words and the words contain lots of double consonants. Plus many finnish words are really boring, like koko (size/whole). Maybe they could be fixed with alternate glyphs that were almost identical but not quite.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There was I thread I started a year or 2 ago regarding very long German words and Czech words with few vowels. Several Typophilers including some of our Finn members contributed some wonderful vowel-rich long words. Lari and Mili were part of it. I have to think of some good search words to find it.
Eben, I think different language text really helps. Itallian is very rhythmic and even while the CE countries texts are much more likelyto be incluusive of typographic kerning issues. I use both in testing (among others).

The following is some silly text which I wrote in 2004 to test my first text face. I don't know that you would call it aesthetic but perhaps just silly. I was just trying to think of words with certain letter combinations and then just free associated stream of conciousness bable.

<div class=commentbody>Note that these are just my personal opinions. This is no way the worst umlauts ever list, I just randomly browsed my library for examples. Also, I’m no font designer.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1_6333.png]
The lower case umlauts look too big, the letters cannot carry them so to speak. Compare to Helvetica:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture7_3904.png]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2_3665.png]
I personally don’t like umlauts that are so close to the letter. (Upper case.) Though Meta’s umlauts are big, I think the letters can handle them quite nicely.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_6735.png]
Almost perfect.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture5_6268.png]
These are nice, too. I write umlauts like this myself, two vertical lines. Some people write one horizontal.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture6_6295.png]
These should be moved just a bit to the right. This is something I notice relatively often.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks so much Lari! I haven't seen such a comparison and analysis anywhere else, so it's really helpful.
One more issue, which I raised in another thread, concerns the height of the single dot--over the i and j--compared to the umlaut. Do you see any fonts with higher i dots than umlauts, and that work? In the font I am working on, Caslon, it traditionally has rather high dots on the i and j. Currently I have the umlauts smaller and lower. Have you seen this work, or only with all the same height? </div>

<div class=commentbody>William --
Whitman's dieresis is smaller and lower than the dot on the i. I don't think this is uncommon.
One of the first magazines to adopt Whitman as part of their type palette (alongside Relay) was the Finnish magazine <i>Trendi</i>. The art director told me in an e-mail "Whitman seems to tackle the strange Finnish language very well." So, I can only assume that the relation of the i-dot and the dieresis characters is acceptable.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Kent, great to see you on typophile once again. I only see the diaresis a bit on the PDF on your personal site. There it seems that the i dot is only slightly higher than the dieresis. What I do notice especially is that you've given a comfortable amount of 'air' between the letters and the dieresis. As excessive tightness is one of the 'bad' features that Lari illustrated, perhaps this is what the Finns liked about your handling of the dieresis or umlaut. At any rate, with your example and the Meta regular weight, I have a pretty good idea of where to go.
Thanks! </div>

Another trick is, how does the font's name look? If that doesn't look right, either the name or the characters are all wrong.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eben, Mili was talking about the umlauts in the all caps section. The treatment Mili showed is quite common in low res matrix screens, unfortunately.
William, I don’t think the dots have to be strictly aligned.
Another annoying but thankfully not common way is placing the umlauts under the x height. Like this:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture4_4965.png]
It would be very nice to have some one named Erik Spiekermann to share their views.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Isn't that only as long as screen resolution is far poorer than print? I keep hearing about electronic ink, IBM's advances in scree resolution, and other technology, though little has come to market yet. But, supposing the mass market gets 300+ dpi and higher screens, won't that make things even?
I know that there is nothing like the present, but it seems that all the hinting in the world is possibly just a stopgap.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It is a stop-gap in some sense yes, to be sure. I see your point I think. More rez more subtlty and less being forced. That's true up to a point. But even if you magically get a device with greater rez than paper - ( say what? - it's just an agrgument - hang in there ) the deeper tension between elements is going to remain. 300+dpi can't make things 'even'. Why?
If you know your going to carry umlauts in your design it's good to know that from the beginning. If you have a Finnish audience in mind specifically then it's good to know that too. And so on. Think about this : it has been noted that type made for german looks better in german & type made for latin in latin. It's true. There are real reasons for this. Lots of them. All the little details! They all interact. Plus the pattens and habits seen in the language/s supported must be factored in and in that a balance has to be struck. So type made specifically for say Danish if it's well made will express itself in the context of Danish needs and priorities and will look and 'act' differently than one made for English. That is why you have to design for a specific set of circumstances every time.
Think about a custom shoe vs a really well designed shoe made for the masses. They will both have alot in common, and might both be plenty good but if the level of quality is the same something made to fit youspecifically will always 'suit you' better.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes Eben, so true.
That is one handicap of the international market, the typedesigners try to design new faces that fit the bill for all markets.
Example, i have to reduce the wordspacing in "nearly every" typeface coming from e.g. GB or USA, when it comes to textsetting in german language. Wordspacing would be "correct" for english or french generally, but not for german. Ok, this is no big thing, but it has to be made.

<div class=commentbody>if you need any more german words with umlauts, give a shout - i could make poms list a bit longer if needed. though not with eszetts, because in switzerland we dont use that glyph (even when writing books in high german - its out of use here).
if you make a long s, make extended kerning tests, it often sucks from what i've seen (altough i dont know many people who'd use a long s in anything than a blackscript).
as said, Chuchichäschtli can be a real killer. Östrogen could be a nice test, too (its the main female hormone). or Önologie, the science of wines.</div>

Thanks for additional test words! Do you have words where Ö is doubled? What about where it appears at the end of a word? Is suspect the answer is no but...
Since you guys know what I am talking about I would love to hear what accomodations you may habe noticed or made to better intergrate dicritics of various kinds. The other things is that when I was working on some for my latest font the method I used was to try to center the marks on each other to some degree. The dot on the i is the 'exception'. Would you let me know what you think of this attached example? I should note that it's a monospace. Please feel free to tell me if you think it's all wrong. But if so please also say how you would correct it!

<cite> Or is because German words are longer? </cite>
Does it also have to do with Caps being too dark/heavy in US & UK designed fonts for german setting? I need to get caught up on modern german typesetting.
What kind of relation does the presence of many diacritics in a language have to the ideal length of descenders/ascenders ?</div>

Hm, less space, because it is more easy to separate words.
Longer german words - yes, you can add this.

For non-german speakers – a nonsense text; "Wortberge" (what is Blindtext called in english?) to get an "original feel" for the "rhythm of german". Maybe you should add an text out of the medical, technical, science field to get the feeling for the real long words .

@Eben
I brought the list because i thought i could be interesting to see caps followed by an umlaut in real words. Maybe an kerning issue, too.
>Do you have words where Ö is doubled?
I think there is no doubled umlaut, i don't remember
>umlaut at the end

<div class=commentbody>Eben, the zdot will appear in Polish close to i in quite a few words, so IMO it looks like a mistake to have it lower than the i dot. And when you get into Celtic....
As a principle, I'd say it's OK to have umlaut dot accents a tad lower than the i dot, if they're also smaller, and because they're two of them. But really, the dot on the eye IS an accent (note Turkish), so it should be treated consistently.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Kent. That shows the relationships of the i and umlauts very well. I'll play with mine to get that kind of relationship between height above the letters and weight, though mine'll have to be different as the design has a quite different feel. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I was thinking about this a bit more - and thinking about organizing principles.
Originally I thought I would organize the examples around letters laid out in a TIRO like sequence a, and then acute, and all the lc a examples, and then b. This still seems okay to me.
But then I thought about doing it my language. Then there would be either one giant list or many small lists. Or both. The idea there would be to allow you select a language or a series to support rather than making you wade through all 60 kinds of lc a+accent combos.
There is 3rd way as well the diacritics.typo.cz way which is to organize around the diacritic itself:
Acute
Bar
Breve
Cedilla
Circumflex
Comma Accent
Diaeresis / Umlaut
Dot Accent
Double Acute
Grave
Háček (Caron)
etc.
The problem I saw with that is that it doesn't give equal billing to the eth for instance.
So I am starting to lean towards the language centered model. It ties in nicely with pages like this:
http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=32
But really, I wonder what you think would be most useful to your own font development process. How do you prefer to organize your work & thoughts? What would be most helpful to you?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I tend to think by language makes the most sense. There are glyph combinations that are common in one language and rare in another. If you compare Finnish and Czech, you get a wholesale change. French, Spanish, and Italian are not that much different. Icelandic has a unique look. In the CE languages, It is not just the coloration created by the heavy use of diacritics, but the clustering of asenders and the frequency of glyph pairings not typical to romance languages. Italian feels rounder and softer with so many vowels compared to the heavier use of angled glyphs in Slovak or Polish.

<div class=commentbody>Cris, good point - I like it. I think I am pretty much convinced. Doing this by langauge also parcels out the work a bit which is nice. I think language centered it is.
If anybody disagrees or has a counter arguement, I hope you post soon!
I think I'll do one in English 1st & then maybe Mili ( and others?) will help me do the finnish & so on. Come to that is anybody willing to help me with the english? Once I have an testbed done as an example does anybody want to claim a language to do?

Last editor: Eben Sorkin
******************
FONT DEVELOPERS: FEEL FREE TO TRIM THESE NOTES OFF
Notes to those adding to or correcting this document: Aesthtics, Frequency and
Difficulty should be considered when adding to this document.
Glyphs covered in this document include:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
also
ÂÀÄÆÊÈÑÙÔÏÇ
âàäæêèñùôïç
Pattern:
For glyphs which are not puctuation the pattern to be used (when possible) is as follows:
1 word with the glyph as the 1st character, 1 word with the glyph as the last, 1 word
with the glyph doubled. Each word is presented in lower case, Inish Caps, and ALL CAPS.
Additional variations may be included at the discretion of the editor, but these should
follow the core sample pattern.
If a pangrams can beadded at the end with or without notes and or translation.
If possible typical/common puctuation such as those for ordering, money, weights etc.
would be good to include as well.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I was going for a mix because English uses short & medium length words in typical use. In contrast, the German version of this document should have short medium & long I think. 

Because English includes 'loanwords' like doppelgänger and Pâté that are used with accents I included accents too but I have separated towards the end them because they are atypical.
Unfortunately I don't have the abreviations and punctuation examples in place yet.
I was thinking one sample per common/major puntuation glyph:
. - Hello.
? - How are you?
, - I am fine, how are you?
; - I was fine before; and now I am fine too.
! - What a silly conversation!
' - 'What a silly conversation'?
" - Yesterday he said "I don't know what you mean by 'What a silly conversation' can you explain?".
(I need to add curly quotes as well)
() - How can you say ( cough, cough) 'What a silly conversation!'?
& - It's just what Bob & Alice say all the time.
# - And write with their #3 pencil I might add.
* - # three* *= Sometimes Number is writter as #.
That kind of thing.
I would also like to have things like 'lbs. , St. (street), St (Saint) but the truth is I haven't looked into it in enough detail. Also I am not as sure that breaking that by langauge is the right way to do it. It might be better to have examples and list where they are used. For instance US & UK standard for this stuff vary I expect.
Mili do you want to start right away or wait until we have all vetted an english template?

Well, that's why I posted it. No doubt there may be better words, better ways or organizing them and even missed examples that aught to be included. What do you think Chris?

<div class=commentbody>This is a long thread, and I have only skimmed it, so I may be trying to make points already made.
The "word test" is a nice idea, but it would be a tremendous effort. In the original post, I saw WAVE. Remember, the amount you kern the "A" to the "W" is constant for all following letters. I pretty much guarantee you if you pick a kern value for "WA" looking at "WAVE', you will be shocked about the "WA" kern value when the word is "WAR."
You are also not apt to come up with all the pairs needed. I've been setting type for almost 30 years, and something you've never thought of always becomes a problem -- Quick: is there a word using "Yg"? Yes, Ygraine, the name of King Arthur's mom.
As to diacritics, I agree they often need work, and not only the umlaut. Both position and shape matters. The macron should have a height over the letters in keeping with the umlaut, and these should also relate to the other diacritics. I also think the accents over capitals should relate to those over the lower-case letters, though what bothers one person may not bother another. The capital accents in Quadraat have always seemed unfortunate to me. Your mileage may vary.
Another place to look at diacritics is in conjunction with other letters. How about "f" with any of the vowels carrying an umlaut or a grave? Frequently, more f-ligatures are needed -- "f_agrave," f_egrave," "f_udieresus" etc. When they are needed, you usually have to redraw the "f" a bit as well as fooling with the position and spacing of accent.
So while a list might be nice, as a comp I've abandoned any hope of coming up with anything complete, and fix things (when the EULA allows, of course) as they come up. I can't resist: for those of you who have a EULA which prohibits the user from any modification, including kerning, I'll bet a considerable sum I've set a book about some topic that will embarrass your font. A better practice, I think, is to work with your "end-users" and update the fonts from time to time as problems appear and are resolved.

<div class=commentbody>I had almost forgotten my favorite English poem for testing type. It has several nonstandard pairings of glyphs is is just plain fun too!
JABBERWOCKY
Lewis Carroll
(from Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, 1872)
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

<div class=commentbody>Charles, the samples we are working on here are not meant to be the basis of a kern test. There are many other good ways of doing that. These samples are meant to help us get a sense of how glyphs are combined in a given language. To help us see patterns we would not imagine otherwise. And so that our designs can be tuned to languages beyond our own.
Chris, I always loved that poem.</div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>lyxvilla = luxury villa in Swedish</blockquote>
This word ↑ almost looks like a Roman numeral.
As for test words: I would include words like:<ul>
<li>"Illinois", "illness", "bilious", "Lilian";</li>
<li>"Lisa", "Laurel", "lawyer", "alas";</li>
<li>"minimum" (as a bare minimum); "mummy", "humdrum", and "mumps".</li></ul>
Also, since I love figures, I'd try:<ul>
<li>1088 + 23 = 1111</li>
<li>5055 × 2 = 10110</li>
<li>7067 × 5 = 35335</li></ul>
for starters. (I'm not telling you why I don't like proportional figures; I'm showing you.)</div>
