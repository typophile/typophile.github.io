body: This project had a very short deadline, so I had no time to present it here
  for feedback, still here you have part of it. It&#39;s a logo for a new recyclable
  inkjet cartridges and tonner product for the portuguese market. In here you have
  the logo and some stickers to place on the cartridges. The packaging design is almost
  finished also. tell me what you think about it.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16702.gif"

    branch of the h &#40;a little lower in reality&#41;. <BR>2. The bottom curve in
    the h

    to say that. If there ever was an excuse to use a rainbow gradient in a logo,
    this is it!
