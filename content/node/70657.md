  body: "The design of the characters is protected under copyright/author rights.
    In most countries these rights remain for long time after the author's death.
    In Brazil, for example, this last 70 years after the death. This is also WIPO
    recommendation and the criteria adopted in many countries.\r\n\r\nEric Gill was
    British and his works are regulated by the British Copyright, Designs and Patents
    Act. I'm not sure if his fonts are classified as artistic design or typographical
    arrangements, two different sections in British law. I'm not a native English
    speaker so I'm unsure if \"typographical arrangements\" are just the diagrammed
    pages or also include the fonts.\r\n\r\nIf Gill's fonts are artistic designs,
    their protection expires in January 1st, 2011. If they are classified as typographical
    arrangements, the protection lasted 25 years after the first publication and thus
    are all expired.\r\n\r\nAll this is jut about the font design. The font software
    is surely protected because both TT and OT fonts are very recent.\r\n\r\nBesides
    this, there are moral rights about one's works. This is not limited in any age
    and may be argued by anyone with rights over Gill's heir. Moral rights refers
    to work integrity and author's reputation.\r\n"

    collection are identically with the original versions, Stempel Garamond for example.
    As far as I remember the collection contains also Gill Sans (with a different
    name). It is legal. And because Gill is dead, it is not immorally. You are not
    a bad human, if you use it. But if you want to silence your conscience, just donate
    to Amnesty or Greenpeace."

    wrong does not justify another.\r\n\r\nExcept from that it is totally unimportant
    with regard to the quality of a piece of art, if the artist is a cannibal or a
    vegetarian. Even if Gill had raped thousands of three year old children, this
    would not lower the quality of his work. None of the 100 Billions human beings,
    that walked on earth was absolute evil or absolute good.\r\n\r\nSo even the question
    <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6979731.stm\">\"Can the
    art of a paedophile be celebrated?\"</a> is ridiculous. (By the way, pedophilia
    is not the crime, but sex abuse is.)\r\n\r\n"

    They are just dead. It is not immorally, but just a poor behavior, if you copy
