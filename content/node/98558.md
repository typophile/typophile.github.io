  together some ideas, but I am looking for help since I am not a professional designer
  nor I am planning to become one.\r\nThese ideas come after various iterations with
  the boss, so I have to stuck with Skia since he likes it.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I just realized that it is better if I explain more about the experiment
    and the logo.\r\n\r\n'Apotema' means Apothem but it has nothing to do with the
    meaning of the word. It is just an acronym. With this experiment we aim to produce
    Technetium, that is a radioactive source used for scintigraphy, with a cyclotron,
    that is a particle accelerator. In a cyclotron, particles are put in the center
    and are accelerated following a spiral trajectory inside a cylindrical cavity
    and come out from one of more wholes on the side of the cylinder. The generated
    beam is forced to go through some tubing and just outside the cylinder it is forced
    to bend.\r\n\r\nThe upper left logo is just centered on the meaning of apothem,
    so I used a regular polygon and emphasized one of its apothems.\r\nThe other logos
    are more centered on the experiment itself. The 'o' symbolizes the cyclotron and
    the lines, coming out of it, symbolize the tubing in which the beam goes along
    with the bend. The spiral inside the 'o' is the particle trajectory."

    collision? If so instead of that swirly thing* you might make the left half of
    the name tilt forward and the right half, backward.\r\n\r\n* Which isn't a bad
    idea - it's just hard to make look nice.\r\n\r\nBTW the name not being related

    instead of his boss/company which put him in the difficult position of having
    to create a logo even though he isn't a designer. \r\n\r\nMost companies wouldn't
    think of asking an employee to do their bookkeeping, or prepare legal papers,
    or even fix their plumbing, if that staffer was not experienced in that area.
    They'd hire a pro instead and view it as part of the cost of doing business. But
    when it comes to design, companies often use the do-it-yourself approach, usually
    with bad results.\r\n\r\nNot a  criticism of Caffeinomane; I hope his project
    turns out well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    for suggesting thinning the joins - that was a knee-jerk reaction and did not
    consider the nature of Biome... Actually you need to make the joins <em>thicker</em>.
    :-/ In fact even filling-in, like the joins in Biome. Also, I would use a darker
    weight, and space the letters tighter. And shorten the descender of the \"p\"
    (it seems to be overshooting the bottom spiral arm). Lastly, the overshoots of
    the spiral arms are different: the top-left one seems to be going further out
    than the bottom-right one; I would shoot for the latter degree.\r\n\r\nBTW, if

    it makes people more aware of how hard it is to do it right, making them more
