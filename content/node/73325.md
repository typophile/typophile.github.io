  like fractions and old style figures. \r\n\r\nIt needs to have:\r\n-upward pointing
  serif on the R leg\r\n-ball-shaped serifs on the J, c, f, g, & r\r\n-the tail of
  the Q loops around the inside of the ellipse\r\n\r\nSome of the \"news\" style faces
  like Excelsior or Corona would probably fit the bill, but as luck would have it,
  none of these seem to be available with the OpenType features I need either."
