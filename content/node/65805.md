  board! \r\n\r\nType ID requests from your mobile have never been easier. Snap the
  pic,and use your mobile twitter client to tweet \"@typeid {message and picture link}\"
  and they will show up on the right sidebar of the TypeID page. \r\n\r\nWe're working
  on a way to integrate these requests into the message board. Until then, feel free
  to tweet these requests back to their submitters using Twitter.\r\n\r\nPlease spread
  the word!"
