  body: I just came home and saw these two posts. I can&#39;t believe I read this.
    It&#39;s too hilarious for words.  <BR> <BR>To &#39;The Designer&#39; -- congratulations.
    You have made &#39;Lord Sauron&#39; weep, something even Gandalf probably couldn&#39;t
    do on his best day. &#40;maybe he will ease up on the Shift key after this, too&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I hope we can quote you if we see this question again from another LOTR
    fan. <BR> <BR>I truly hope you have a good day too. You just made mine.
