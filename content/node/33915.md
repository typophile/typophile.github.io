  \"A selection of types from six centuries in use at the office of Joh. Ensched\xE9
  en Zonen at Haarlem, Holland, Printed & Issued in the year MDCCCCXXX'\r\n\r\nWhich
  got me wondering. What other [[books]] might my fellow typophiles recommend that
  are not hyper-rare or hyper-expensive but which would be good to have while studying
  type history & especially text text type? For instance, I remember reading that
  some books set in metal Bembo can be had for a song if the content is of dubious
  interest now. Any faves in that category? What about Van Dijck's stuff? The reason
  I ask is I am near some antiquarian book stores in So Cal for just a little while
  & I would like to make good use of the opportunity! I could just buy things online
  I guess but this would be more fun."

    and Morison, about $75.\r\n\r\nAmerican Proprietary Typefaces, David Pankow, <a
    href=\"http://www.veatchs.com/aphaPubs.aspx\">$50 new.</a>\r\n\r\nThe Solotype
    Catalog, about $20.\r\n\r\nAn <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000893.php\">ATF
    catalog</a>. I like my 1912 best (about $250), but the '34 or '41 edition is a
    must-have at around $15-$20 if you can't afford one of the big ones.\r\n\r\nA
    View of Early Typography, by Harry Carter, about $25. Scholarly as well as rich
    in beautiful specimens. And it's Matthew's dad.\r\n\r\nThe practice of typography,
    by de Vinne. Plain Printing Types is about $70.\r\n\r\nTypographia, or the Printer's
    Instructor, by John Johnson, 1824. Roughly $60 for each of the volumes. The extensive
    (221 pp) section on non-latin scripts alone is well worth the price.\r\n\r\nYou
    can get a decent Baskerville edition for around $100.\r\n\r\nHmm, that's a few
    hundred bucks, maybe more if you go all-out. But I can definitely think of worse
    ways to blow a grand."

  body: "In terms of \"bang for buck\", you might look for <cite>Books and Printing:
    A Treasury for Typophiles</cite> edited by Paul A. Bennett, (1951: Cleveland and
    New York, The World Publishing Co.)\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of essays on type,
    typography, and printing. The book was composed in twenty-one different typefaces,
    including Baskerville, Bell, Bembo, Bodoni Book, Caledonia, Caslon, Centaur, Deepdene,
    Eldorado, Electra, Emerson, Fairfield . . . the list goes on. (Looks like the
    composition was both Monotype and Linotype.)\r\n\r\nSo you get a nice specimen
    of different faces in use, plus great articles by the likes of Goudy, Dwiggins,
    Rogers, Rushmore, Morison, Updike, Cleland, Armitage, and many others. Bennett
    was the head of publicity for Mergenthaler Linotype. \r\n\r\nThe book is 400+
    pp. I think I got my copy for around $10. Shouldn't be too hard to find.\r\n\r\nWalter
    Tracy listed this in his resources in <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>, which is
    how I got turned on to it.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"

  body: "Wow. More excellent ideas. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI want to see if I can push
    this idea just bit further or see if perhaps I have a mistken notion here... feel
    free to take that postion too.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in LA I found a book about some
    random nonsense printed in 1731. I am still working to figure out what it's printed
    in. At first I thought Fleischman because of the narrow a and the wild italics.
    Now I am not so sure. Anyway it was exciting at $60 despite it's printing flaws.
    It is a rich visual reference. The reason I mention it is that part of what's
    fun about the book is that the type in it is being used or applied. And you can
    see the color of it on the page. This seems like a great thing.\r\n\r\nSo I with
    that in mind; I was wondering if in addition to the Treasuries, Atlas' & Catalogs
    -you guys also like to collect books just because they are set in a given face.
    For instance, ( sorry for the repetition ) is there a classic well printed letterpress
    edition of something that is known for it's excellent Bembo, or Fleischman, or
    Caledonia or whatever you are keen on?"

  body: "I have been known to buy books primarily for the typeface, but I rarely acquire
    a non-type book just for the type itself if there isn't also some non-type interest
    for me. \r\n\r\nFor example, it's not hard at all to find decent books set in
    Caledonia (seems like half the books produced in the U.S. in the 1950s were set
    in it). But I enjoy nature writing and I have a book, <cite>Footnotes on Nature</cite>
    by John Kieran with wood engravings by Nora S. Unwin, that I also enjoy as a great
    exemplar of Caledonia in everyday use from that period. I bought it partly for
    the topic and partly for the type and design. It's just an ordinary trade edition,
    not particularly precious or collectible, nothing too special. But that's exactly
    how Caledonia was meant to be used, and I love seeing it like that. \r\n\r\nI
    did once pick up a book primarily because it was printed in Ruzicka's Primer (which
    is much less common). But it was also by Hermann Hesse, an author whose work I
    admire (although I've never gotten around to reading the whole book -- <cite>Beneath
    the Wheel</cite>, a minor work). I definitely would not have bought the book if
    it wasn't set in Primer (or some other typeface of keen interest). On the other
    hand, I don't know if I would have bought the book if there wasn't some small
    additional interest beyond the type. \r\n\r\nHowever, I did once buy a fairly
    pricey collectible first-edition of essays by Wallace Stevens, <cite>The Necessary
    Angel</cite>, solely because it is a rare example set in Dwiggins's Stuyvesant
    (which was never released). I've always enjoyed Wallace Stevens's poetry, but
    these essays are a bit over my head, and I wouldn't have bought the book except
    for the type. (And I sought it out specifically for that reason.)\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
