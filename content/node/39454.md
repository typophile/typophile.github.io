body: "I'm trying to identify the fonts on Mallory and Irvine's altimeter from their
  1924 expedition to Mt. Everest. I only have this low quality photo for refference.
  I have tried the identifont with no luck. Is it possible to identify the fonts based
  on this photo and that the font must be older than 1924?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mallory_6041.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/poston/everest/alt-fig1.jpg|link
