    users do not have to carry the burden of thousands more dishonest ones. Those
    who buy fonts are paying for the thousands more that are pirated. Hence, a catch
    22: I&#39;m sorry, a type face is not worth 200 dollars in the marketplace--particularly
    to students and low-brow design shops, which, hate them or not, do the great majority
    of the work in America. They are the guys that do ugly yellow page ads for plumbers,
    and make ugly vinyl signs for chinese take-out. It&#39;s work that has to be done,
    and they can&#39;t pay $200 for a china-town type face ripped off from some dead
    designer from the fifties. &#40;He doesn&#39;t get royalties&#41;. <BR> <BR>Piracy
    will not stop until type foundries lower their prices to a reasonable level. Unfortunately
    they cannot do that until the piracy stops. Catch 22.  <BR> <BR>About billing
    clients: Type can&#39;t really be compared to illustrations or photography, that
    are typically purchased for one use. As I mentioned earlier, Wong&#39;s Chinese
    Takeout won&#39;t pay $200 for a type face. What&#39;s more, if they would, shouldn&#39;t
    they get the licence for the next time they need to change the price on won-ton
    soup? We don&#39;t often bill clients for software, why should we bill them for
    type? Why would we not let them know it if we did? I&#39;m not trying to be moralistic
    here. I have billed clients for type. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s that easy
    of an issue. We would be miffed if a wrench showed up on our mechanic&#39;s bill.
    Type is different from a wrench, but how much so? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe
    in piracy. In my life I have only pirated about 5 faces, a few of which are shame-
    facedly huddled in a folder on my hard-drive marked &#34;pirated&#34;, each one
    hoping to one day be legitimized or deleated. But... I unabashedly download mp3&#39;s
    and don&#39;t buy all the cds. Then again, I listen to the same songs on the radio
    without paying a thing either. <BR> <BR>Someone needs to bite the bullet here.
    As a designer who uses type, I would hope to be honest. As a designer who sells
    type-- I should charge an honest price for a type face. <BR> <BR>But I will probably
    charge as much as I can like anyone else, dang it. I guess I&#39;m just saying,
    it&#39;s not a simple issue. One thing&#39;s for sure-- it shouldn&#39;t be illegal
    to embed a font in a document. Go home emigre. '

  body: ' Christian, <BR> <BR>The radio analogy doesn&#39;t work completely either,
    because, while you may not pay for the music directly, the advertisers pay the
    radio station, and the station pays royalty-type fees &#40;BMI, ASCAP, etc.&#41;
    for the music. The advertisers recoup their money from sales to you, the radio
    listener. <BR> <BR>This system is not all that unlike the system that has evolved
    for typefaces, especially given the increasing notion of &#34;subscription&#34;
    or &#34;library&#34; discounts -- licensing a foundry&#39;s entire library for
    a one-time fee that represents a substantial discount over the costs of each font
    individually. <BR> <BR>Also, while a font family can seem expensive to license
    at $200, it is also &#40;more or less, in most cases&#41; a lifetime license that
    can be used over and over again. Looking at the body of licensed fonts that I
    use most often, and breaking them down across all the various client projects
    on which they have been used, I could certainly easily recoup my costs of licensing
    by charging a flat rate $10 or even $5 font licensing fee to my clients. <BR>
    <BR>Admittedly, this is not something I have been doing, but it sounds like a
    reasonable idea that I will now seriously consider. I can&#39;t imagine a single

    <BR>What you are suggesting sounds perfectly feasable for SHAREWARE fonts, where

    if it is actually used. Indeed, the shareware arrangement is exactly as you described.
    <BR> <BR>However, for fonts offered by most companies, whether by online sale,
    CD sale or mail order sale, it&#39;s pretty clear that they don&#39;t intend even

    I&#39;m not sure how you determined that &#34;only the most wealthy and successful
    artists argued on the side of the prosecution.&#34; That wasn&#39;t my perception
    at all, but I won&#39;t try to guess what everyone else&#39;s opinion was. The
    fact of the matter is that American &#40;and many other nations&#39;&#41; copyright
    laws were being violated, harming the interests of the artists who created the
    work. That millions of people may have been taking part in this doesn&#39;t change
    that fact, nor does their opinion &#40;or other artists&#39; opinions&#41; that
    they had a &#34;right&#34; to freely distribute the artists&#39; work. The law
    says that they didn&#39;t, and the courts upheld this. That&#39;s a strong precedent
    that can &#40;and should&#41; be applied to the protection of type designers&#39;
    interests as well. <BR> <BR>Whether CD knockoffs or pirated fonts are more damaging
    to the industry is not the issue; they are BOTH damaging to the industry, and
    the industry must be protected from both. <BR> <BR>The difference in the case
    you mentioned is that the Underware Foundry CHOSE to give their fonts away for
    free. Bravo; more power to them. Again, what you are describing is SHAREWARE.
    <BR> <BR>Shouldn&#39;t designers who choose to SELL licenses to their fonts also
    have that right, AND have the ability to enforce that right? <BR> <BR>As a type
    designer myself, I will probably choose to freely distribute some of my works,
    as a way of publicly promoting my other designs. Shouldn&#39;t I have the right
    to choose which of my own designs to distribute freely, and which of my designs
    to demand a licensing fee for their use? And shouldn&#39;t the law protect and
    provide enforcement for that right? No one has a &#34;right&#34; to use my work
    without providing me just compensation for it, and the same goes for any artist,
    designer or any other producer of goods or services. <BR> <BR>I know from reading
    licensing agreements that many other type designers feel the same way about their
    work. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' I laugh when I hear the type foundries talking about copyright. More than
    any other field type foundries copy the designs of others &#40;living and dead&#41;.
    How many imitation faces are there in my URW type library? The question gets stickier
    when we start to talk about plagiarism-- but maybe we are approaching this the
    wrong way. There is great value in many people attacking the same problem. In
    type design more than anything else, it is hard to draw the line where one face
    starts looking too similar to another. <BR> <BR>What about sign painters? They
    didn&#39;t pay to licence lettering styles done by other people &#40;any more
    than punch cutters did&#41;. Why is it so sacred when it gets in digital format--
    because it becomes software? It&#39;s not like other software. I think more designers
    should modify the fonts they work with for specific jobs &#40;just like sign painters
    did&#41;. Why not alter a few charactaristics in a font? The original designer
    took a great deal from other designers. What if a few of his/her letters don&#39;t
    work so well for a specific project. Our society&#39;s idea of ownership is wacked
    out. Logotypes in particular-- It is pathetic how many logotypes are simply a
    typed font. <BR> <BR>Why weren&#39;t designers affraid when they were borrowing
    each other&#39;s letters while painting them? Beceause they were all creating.
    They were all interpreting. The way you stay ahead is by adding something new.
    Why don&#39;t more designers do this now? We often hold type design in such awe
    that hardly anyone does it. &#34;I&#39;m not a type designer&#34; I hear this
    all the time. How can you be a designer and not design type? What do you do with
    logo types? It&#39;s different for text faces, which are more technical, but still--
    <BR> <BR> <BR>As I mentioned, type is different from other software. All software
    requires a user to have software to work with files. However, there are only a
    handful of formats. With fonts, there are thousands on thousands. Should prepress
    shops, or even designers working in collaboration have to licence fonts separately?
    Should one user have to licence a font twice for different machines? What if there
    are many users using one machine, like in a computer lab. Should each user have
    to licence the font, or should the lab have to pay more because more people are
    using it? How about embeding fonts in documents-- can&#39;t have that outline
    information out there. Everyone is afraid of the digital format. <BR> <BR>One
    last thing: Historical faces. Somehow, when a designer is dead, this gives us
    a right to steal their work? YES. It makes sense to everyone. Everyone adapts
    historical faces and takes great pride in it. Why not adapt living people&#39;s
    faces. Of course credit should be given where credit is due. The same goes for
    artists covering songs. Some of the coolest songs are covers... but licensing
    so often gets in the way &#40;that&#39;s one reason I like file-swapping&#41;.
    What happened to the days where standards were sung by everyone, everyone giving
    their unique twist? <BR> <BR>We keep talking about the morals of ownership. What
    does ownership mean when it comes to ideas, designs, creativity? We tend to view
    ideas in terms of the equation: Ideas = Money. Therefore, to use someone elses
    idea is stealing their money. But no idea, or creative leap is based on itself--
    they all borrow from others. Really the underlying idea is: all designers should
    get compensated for thier work. It just so happens that the system we live in
    functions under the i=$ equation, and therefore we assign ownership to ideas.
    It doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t other ways to compensate those who do
    the work. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to think of some other ways of doing this. I&#39;m
    trying to get further outside the box. '

    If it  <BR>&#62;is &#39;right&#39;, then what is the appropriate way  <BR>&#62;to
    do this?  <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;m cross-posting this to TypeRight members so they
    can comment if they think I&#39;m misrepresenting the group&#41; <BR> <BR>I think
    we&#39;ve discussed this within TypeRight several times, and I think the answer
    is in the ethics guide already. We believe, as I suppose most of you do, that
    typefaces should be protected by copyright. The current standard for copyright
    persistence is 75 years after the death of the author. <BR> <BR>Therefore I think
    it&#39;s implied, because of the combination of the TypeRight mission statement
    and the ethics guide, that we believe that all type should be so protected, or
    rather be regarded has having such protection - whether an individual state allows
    for such protection or not. <BR> <BR>ie, ethically we believe that 75 years after
    the death of the author any revivals etc can take place without the permission
    of the author&#39;s estate. <BR> <BR>On a personal level I have some problems
    with this. <BR> <BR>Firstly, 75 years after the authors death could be 100-150
    years after the creation of the item. This seems like an exceptionally long period
    of time to protect the rights of the author &#40;as he or she has been dead for
    some time&#41;. <BR> <BR>At the same time I think it unreasonable for people to
    directly copy the work of others and earn a profit from it - ie when the work
    is out of copyright. <BR> <BR>So, my compromise on this is, that whatever the
    state decides is reasonable copyright persistence, for all creative works, should
    be my guiding light. ie if the law states copyright for literature or music should
    persist until death &#43; 75 years, then ethically I believe that the same standard
    should apply to type. <BR> <BR>As to the &#34;correct&#34; way to &#34;revive&#34;
    a face? <BR> <BR>To do it properly you have to go back to the sources and study
    them. A revival of Garamond for example is not copying one of the modern Garamond
    interpretations &#40;as these are revivals themselves&#41;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    worth noting in this case that Adobe Garamond has a design patent - so is protected
    in its design as being original. <BR> <BR>&#62;2&#41; It has become standard operating
    procedure  <BR>&#62;for the free-font crowd to make a font <BR>&#62;based on a
    car, movie or TV logo, or some  <BR>&#62;&#39;found glyphs&#39;. Or to make a
    font based  <BR>&#62;on some signage that was discovered over  <BR>&#62;on fourth
    street. What is appropriate  <BR>&#62;and what isn&#39;t? Does the designer of
    the  <BR>&#62;logos or the sign painter factor into  <BR>&#62;this equation or
    are glyphs and logos  <BR>&#62;treated differently than an entire font. <BR>&#62;Further,
    what if you see ONE letter and make  <BR>&#62;a face based on that. What if the
    face is <BR>&#62;based on TWENTY LETTERS? <BR> <BR>In some cases I think that
    faces that copy directly from a logo and expand on that may well be infringing
    copyright, design patent and/or trademark - in such cases it&#39;s up to the rights
    holder to enforce the law. <BR> <BR>However, again, I think this is covered in
    the ethics guide. It would be unethical to copy the work of others directly. <BR>
    <BR>As to the level of that... I think pretty much from scratch. <BR> <BR>My personal
    view on typeface copying is that it&#39;s not a matter of a certain number of
    characters being the same, but of the character of the whole face in use being
    the same. <BR> <BR>Of course at the same time there have been, and continue to
    be, many designers that take influence from &#34;found&#34; typography. Probably
    the most famous example of this is Erik van Blokland&#39;s Trixie - indeed Letterror
    did a whole series of such faces. And of course later there were many, many &#34;dirty
    typewriter faces&#34; copying Letterror&#39;s &#34;original&#34; idea. <BR> <BR>In
    such cases I think we have to consider what the end result was, and whether the
    source was something &#34;generic&#34;. <BR> <BR>Clearly a logo is not &#34;generic&#34;
    it has a specific purpose and is probably quite recent in its design &#40;for
    it to be thought &#34;worthy&#34; of copying&#41;. <BR> <BR>On the other hand
    a font based on a stencil or a typewiter can be seen as generic because the essential
    form has been in use for perhaps hundreds or years - often dictated by an industrial
    process of some kind. In any event no author or copyright holder is known. <BR>
    <BR>Somewhere between these extremes are the styles used in signage. Again some
    of these styles may have been in use for hundreds of years, many are based on
    &#34;generic&#34; forms of handwriting and often the author of the original is
    unknown. <BR> <BR>I think in these cases one must take an objective view: is the
    subject matter specific or generic. If it is specific then you are probably beyond
    the bounds of the TypeRight ethics guide. If it is generic then you are probably
    acting ethically. <BR> <BR>One thing however I would consider in the latter case:
    if the subject is generic, then what would be the point of copying it, except
    to create another generic work? I&#39;d also question, whether, as a designer,
    you would really gain anything from such a project with its inherent lack of creativity
    on your part. '

    of the journalism world &#40;insert laughter&#41; and something that I learned

    <BR> <BR>Some people don&#39;t give a rip, but I&#39;d like to figure out the

    my previous post, I was hit with a couple of emails from people pointing me to
    Luc Devroye&#39;s site, specifically the &#39;legal&#39; part of it. It is at
    once fascinating and depressing. It appears that some of the top foundries and
    type designers have acted unethically at some point, some of them brazenly, some
    of them furtively. <BR>  <BR> <BR>&#42; The origin of my question stems from reading
    often about &#34;this face is based upon lettering found&#34; in &#40;fill in
    the blank&#41; or this face uses the &#40;fill in typeface&#41; model. Look at
    all of the stuff ITC is doing that is &#39;retro&#39;. In the liner notes, it&#39;s
    all about &#39;I found this face while looking through a 1920s magazine&#39; and
    I made it into a font.&#39;   <BR> <BR>Anyway, creativity is my lifeblood and
    soul mate and type design is just another outlet. I love it! All the politics
    I&#39;d like to stay away from! <BR> <BR>In January, check out Apollo26.com, a

    <BR> <BR>&#62;Clive&#39;s fonts Julius and Adams Rounded are <BR>&#62;slight adjustments

    ago called Ikarus, I think it was probably one of the first, if not the first,
    type digitising applications. We&#39;re going back to the early to mid 1970s here.
    <BR> <BR>URW consequently received a lot of contract work from the large foundries
    of the time &#40;Linotype, Berthold...&#41; to digitise their fonts for their
    dedicated typesetting systems. <BR> <BR>You have to remember here that hardware
    was the important thing to these foundries, fonts were just packages to help sell
    the hardware. <BR> <BR>Part of the contract between URW and the foundries stipulated
    that URW owned the data that they digitised. No one thought anything of this at
    the time, because URW was not selling typesetting systems &#40;required to use
    the fonts&#41; and was in no position to set up such a business. <BR> <BR>Now
    fast forward 10-15 years. Apple introduces the Macintosh in 1984 and within 7-8
    years had effectively killed the traditional typesetting businesses and the hardware
    suppliers. <BR> <BR>Now type is hardware independent and can be used in almost
    any application on several platforms. No longer dedicated to one application running
    on one particular piece of hardware. <BR> <BR>URW finds itself with the rights
    to a huge library of other people&#39;s fonts. Or, more precisely, URW finds itself
    with the rights to the outline data of such fonts but not the names. So it bundles
    itself up a CD-ROM and starts selling the data as PostScript fonts. <BR> <BR>Several
    people tried to take action against URW and failed, because of the contracts they
    signed. <BR> <BR>Moral of the story is: this is actually a complicated legal issue,
    compounded by the fact that the old foundries didn&#39;t have crystal balls and
    could not foresee that their businesses would undergo fundamental changes due
    to revolutionary change in software and hardware in other fields. '

    = Ethical? Not! Not even &#34;guiding light&#34;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think I
    really wrote legal = ethical. I think what I wrote was that where copyright is
    in place then legal should pretty much = ethical. Where copyright or similar protection
    is not in place then one should look to the way other works are protected by copyright
    and adopt that standard for your ethics. <BR> <BR>So, in the EU we don&#39;t have
    a problem because all 15 states are compelled by a directive to have protection
    in place, 75 years after death. So I think it&#39;s reasonable to adopt that standard
    ethically &#40;for the reasons I&#39;ve already stated&#41;. <BR> <BR>In the US
    there&#39;s no copyright protection for type. So what I&#39;m advocating is that
    ethically one should look at how music, photography and literature are protected
    and adopt that standard. <BR> <BR>So, other items protected by copyright in the
    US are protected for 75 years after death, therefore ethically you should adopt
    that standard to type too. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll expand upon why I think that at this
    point it&#39;s ethical to &#34;copy&#34;. <BR> <BR>One must realise that there
    are many aspects to intellectual property protection than type, for example literature
    and music and other areas like patent for machines and drugs etc. <BR> <BR>Legally,
    various governments have come up with very similar rules to govern the protection
    of such. And generally I think they&#39;ve pretty much come to good compromises.
    I don&#39;t think it&#39;s apropriate for drug patents to last 150 years or more,
    neither do governments, so they are restricted to 15-20 years. There are at least
    some moral arguments for this being too long, but there must be some compromise.
    <BR> <BR>So I think that if you take in some of the wider issues of IP protection,
    legal = ethical. <BR> <BR>There are of course some anomalies, the US position
    of type copyright being one of them. <BR>  <BR>&#62;2. Luc&#39;s site is not perfect,

    of the Gray. <BR> <BR>Please, one example of this &#34;cold hard light&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>All I can see are quite a few unwarrented attacks on people, driven by some
    weird agenda. There&#39;s no uncovering of facts here, the facts have been obscured
    where they are quite clearly known. <BR> <BR>How are the quotes noted above about
    Erik van Blokland and myself, as well as the attack on Simon Daniels, displaying

    we <BR>&#62;admit that all creativity takes from other <BR>&#62;people&#39;s ideas.
    <BR> <BR>Um, well this question needs to go through the whole overview of intellectual
    property protection, why it was put in place and its historical context. <BR>
    <BR>And there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going into all of that. <BR> <BR>However, I
    can perhaps answer the part about originality and subtlety. <BR> <BR>Copyright
    protection extends to items which are original. ie items that are not derived
    from others. So, where there is clear derivation from a known original the copyright
    of the orginal persists. Something that is derived from something else cannot
    be wholly original in itself. <BR> <BR>However, there is one area of copyright
    that does allow for some measure of &#34;sameness&#34;. That is that works created
    independently can have equal protection, even though they appear to be derived
    from another source. <BR> <BR>For example, if I write a poem, and you write one
    too, and they turn out to be identical, or very close to each other, then as long
    as I haven&#39;t seen your poem and you haven&#39;t seen mine, or work contibuting
    to them, then we both have protection and neither is infringing the other. <BR>
    <BR>Note that this doesn&#39;t apply to patent where uniqueness is required. <BR>
    <BR>&#62;This doesn&#39;t deny that bad rip-offs are just, <BR>&#62; well, bad.
    But why should a <BR>&#62;subtle, yet beautiful, variation be illegal?  <BR> <BR>A
    variant is clearly derived, so therefore it would be illegal, yes. There are exceptions,
    most foundries permit you to modify fonts you&#39;ve paid for, with the restriction
    that you cannot redistibute them, or that they cannot be used where a licence
    for the original doesn&#39;t exist. <BR> <BR>This is logical if you think about
    it, because oherwise you could make a slight adjustment to something and then
    distribute it, what income would the original author have? <BR> <BR>&#62;Are we
    only concerned about money here? <BR> <BR>Yes, pretty much. <BR> <BR>However there
    are other aspects. Getting further into the background of IP protection it is
    essentially a deal between creators and government to protect the rights of the
    creators while giving access to the public. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s say that writers
    didn&#39;t have protection for their work, what encouragement would there be for
    them to expend much effort on creating new work? They would publish and anyone
    else could copy the original and sell it as their own. <BR> <BR>But we do have
    protection for literature and consequently we have the choice of hundreds of thousands
    of books at a reasonable price. <BR> <BR>This principal works across all IP. If
    the creator can get an income from their work then that encourages them to produce
    further work, it makes it cheap for the public to buy and it gives more choice.
    <BR> <BR>The best thing about this is that it actually does work and has been
    proven to work over a hundred years or more. <BR> <BR>If creators were not rewarded
    in monetary forms to pay for their efforts then probably the majority of output
    would be on an amateur level. '

    were interested in spreading their  <BR>&#62;particular perspective on piracy,
    etc. <BR> <BR>Quite, and that&#39;s to whom Luc&#39;s site appeals. <BR> <BR>Hrant
    alludes to hidden corners and dirty deals, which are the rumours spread by those
    with a &#34;particular perspective&#34; to smear the larger type foundries. <BR>
    <BR>I think these are almost entirely unjustified and just equivalent to urban
    myths. Look at the truth behind Christian&#39;s statements about URW for example.
    <BR> <BR>If Hrant thinks there are some facts behind these rumours then he should
    post them, rather than allude to the supposed facts posted at the site mentioned. '

    we admit that all creativity takes from other people&#39;s ideas.&#62;&#62; <BR>
    <BR>but I was slow at the keyboard. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Christian, with all due respect, you&#39;re oversimplifying
    something that is complex and deep and dear to my heart: creativity. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    spent a freaky long time reading about creativity, ideas, innovation, etc. and
    without causing any blisters here, i will say this: <BR>There&#39;s still plenty
    of room to innovate without doing &#39;remixes&#39; or &#39;variations&#39; There
    are enough remixers out there. You don&#39;t have to agree with TypeRight or Clive,
    or agree with silly copyright laws, but these perspectives allow us to see a bigger
    picture when we sit down at our computer and &#39;type&#39;. Now, November 2001,
    you can alter your perspective. Do stuff that hasn&#39;t been done before b/c
    you certainly have the skill! <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>there are many mind-altering
    books on creativity and innovation that I could suggest. <BR> <BR> <BR>p.s. to
    Hrant: What exactly is the GRAY. Sounds like a novel unfolding. '

  body: ' I&#39;d agree with BJ, you don&#39;t have to agree with me, or with whatever
    the law says. But the law is there for a reason, and for the most part it really
    isn&#39;t there to stifle creativity or innovation, quite the opposite. <BR> <BR>The
    whole issue of IP law is a lot more complicated than most people think, and has
    taken literally hundreds of years to get where it is today. <BR> <BR>So, maybe,
    chill out a little, read some stuff about copyright, look at the wider picture.
    <BR> <BR>I buy things that are protected too, like software and music and books,
    and sure I&#39;d like to have them all for free. But I&#39;d also like to have
    my work protected and have real choice over what CDs or books I buy - and I really
    don&#39;t mind if a great author ands up a millionaire because I bought a book.
    <BR> <BR>If the people that write this stuff don&#39;t get paid then they won&#39;t
    do it - not only will you not be able to buy it, you won&#39;t even be able to
    steal it. <BR> <BR>Creativity is about a lot more than adapting someone else&#39;s
    ideas. '
