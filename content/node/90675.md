  body: There are some differences between your sample and what I know of Pialat.
    Later versions MAY have alternate glyphs, or it's possible that Commercial Type
    did a unique font for Vogue.

  body: "I see the light! Thank you for your helpful comments. Indeed, it seems to
    be by Hubert Jocham. The Pialat is quite beautiful though. \r\nMany fashion magazines
    seem to use the Caslon and Didot or Didot-like staples.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n"
