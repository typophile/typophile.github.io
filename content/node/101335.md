  body: "ok. my fault \u2013\_you both were right!!! the first example is definitely
    Liebe Erika (example from myfonts). but it\u2019s not the same as the second sample
    which is the original font.\r\n\r\nany suggestions for the second example?"

    same font. Anyway, I tried harder and looked over all \"thin condensed handwritten\"
    fonts I know but wasn't able to find it out. I drop here another sample, may be
    someone else will spot it out.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4986.png]"

    (in one or more of it's variations... you choose.\r\n\r\nin addition, i sortof
    wonder if this is a font that has been distorted past its normal (and possibly
    recognizable) state. if you squeeze a line of the sample disproportionally, can
    you find something that matches then?"
