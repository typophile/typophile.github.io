body: "I've always wondered exactly what font the brothers Warner used on their record
  labels from the late 60's to the mid-70's. It seemed to get used a lot back in the
  day, but I don't see it too much anymore...it resembles Futura, but it's not that-
  if it works correctly, I've attached a sample. If not, here's the link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reprise_Label_Tricolor_Kinks.JPG\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to set type on a doctor's chart that uses this font, and I thought it was
  high time I learned what it was called, and if I can find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAny
  help will be greatly appreciated!"

  body: Googling more detailed samples seems to suggest a variety of fonts were used...
    [[http://thriftyvinyl.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1639.jpg|This one]] is clearly
    Gill for example.

  body: "I don't think it's Vogue; while the lower case y is similar, the upper case
    G is very different, as is the C.\r\n\r\nSometimes, at odd times, other plants
    pressed Warners albums and sometimes the font was different. That Sinatra album
    was from 1967, so it could be they hadn't settled on one yet. Most Warner/Reprise
    albums after 1975 went to a more conventional, Univers-like font. Here's a link
    to another sample- it's the font used for the song titles that I'm most interested
    in. The album title itself is (I'm pretty sure) Helvetica Black Condensed, which
    they used on their 8-track spines at the time. \r\n\r\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/davidallenjones/December212011?authuser=0&feat=directlink\r\n\r\nYeah,
    it's another Kinks album. Entirely coincidental. :-)"

  body: "As you can see (http://typophile.com/node/38560#comment-236085) there were
    several alternates. \r\nBut also several other Futura-like typefaces. "

  body: Oh well, thanks anyway, everyone. It's probably some old letterpress type
    that no one uses anymore. The doctor will get Futura and like it, and my decades-old
    question will remain a mystery.
