body: "Some posted awhile ago about what fonts the Walrus, a Canadian magazine, uses.
  However, these are different than they used to be. The text font in the first image
  (readyblaz) seems to be a customized version of Monotype Mentor (e.g. the lc y).
  But if you look at the italic (The Betrayal), its completely different from Mentor's
  italic.\r\n\r\nThe second image, (Telling All), looks like a font I've seen used
  on signage at a recent art exhibition here in Winnipeg. I've looked all over online
  to determine which it is. At first I thought it was something from DSType, but I
  couldn't find a match there. Does anyone know of the names and availability of these
  fonts? \r\n\r\nA related question would be, if these are custom work for the magazine,
  who does the work? I'd be interested to know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    recognize the other one?
