body: "Hi guys! I'm a student, so, needless to say, I've definitely never done any
  professional design work, but I do work a lot on InDesign in class, so I'm pretty
  familiar with the way things work in the USA. My question concerns typographic units
  outside of the English speaking world. I was reading some article somewhere that
  mentioned that other countries don't use picas--which was a novel idea to me. I'm
  just used to twelve points in a pica, six picas in an inch etc. So I started looking.\r\n\r\nI've
  found, that, in countries like Italy and France, there's a system in place originally
  created by Fran\xE7oise-Ambroise Didot which goes like this:\r\n12 lignes = 1 French
  Royal Inch\r\n6 didot points (dd) = 1 ligne\r\n12 dd = 1 cicero\r\n6 ciceros = 1
  French Royal Inch\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to me, although it takes a little thought
  to get my head wrapped around it. But I love the names, they're much prettier than
  the American/British method. I also read that Japan uses the American/British system,
  but I haven't been able to find anything else out about other countries. Are there
  units tailored to the metric system, used in other places? It would be nice, the
  ratios <i>are</i> admittedly pretty weird :P"

    Aicher wanted to see Europe adopt this system.\r\nBTW you might have already learned
    that before any unit was invented\r\ntype sizes were referred to by names (like
    \"pearl\" meant 5 point).\r\n\r\nSorry for all the acronyms. LOL. Not really.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    when creating tables (or tabs) with irregular column widths, to switch measurement
    units until I came up with something that divided into manageable integers."

    never used Quark at all, but does it use didot points, too? Or does it incorporate
    Ciceros into picas?"

  body: "A Didot point was somewhere around 0.03759 centimetres; I think that the
    current \"official\" value is one of 0.037593985 centimeters, as established by
    Berthold in 1879.\r\n\r\nAs for the metric system, a revised Didone of 0.04 centimetres
    is apparently in use by the French Imprimerie Nationale, I once read somewhere.
    0.0375 would be closer, and quite convenient.\r\n\r\nMyself, I find it annoying
    that the point is 0.013837 inches instead of exactly 1/72\". In any event, a Didot
    point is about 15/14 of an English point."

  body: "The fact that Quark rounded off the pica to the order of 72 pts to an inch
    has troubled me deeply for years. InDesign at least offers an option to define
    the correct 72,27 pts\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Dutch measure was called Augustijn (although
    Cicero has been in use too) and is equal to 4.5112781 mm. Commonly rounded of
    to 4,5 mm, I am afraid.\r\n\r\nAnother baffling fact: the working height of lead
    type varies enormously (if I may use that expression) \u2014 I will have to dive
    into the literature to substantiate that claim, but maybe others can chime in
    here\u2026"

  body: "There are more than two metal type heights, but the most common are North
    America/UK at .918\" and a European 23.56mm. There are many different European
    type heights, but 23.56 is common (if I remember correctly) in Germany and France,
    among others.\r\n\r\nI have never heard of European type being \"converted\" to
    UK/NA height. It would not match up to spacing available, regardless, as it is
    all still cast to Didot point/cicero and not the ATF point specs.\r\n\r\nIs this
    stuff really relevant? Very few are doing repro proofing. Why lament the \"bastardization\"
    of one point to 1/72 of one inch? The only reason I can think is that it's not
    metric, but other than that, why make conversions more complicated? I'm a letterpress
    printer myself, but I embrace the digital point of 1/72\"."

  body: Um, if one doesn't round off the Augustijn, 1/12 of it is about 0.375939841667
    mm, which compares rather closely to a Didot point of 0.37593985 mm, as used by
    Berthold. So I'm not sure if the <em>unit</em> is actually distinct, as compared
    to the <em>name</em>.
