  one) used for the logo on the front of the box for the movie \"Amelie\".\r\n\r\nHere's
  a link:\r\n\r\nhttp://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000069JDB.02.LZZZZZZZ.jpg\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could help, I'd really really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nDave.\r\n\r\nPS-If you
  haven't already seen it, you should definately check out this movie!"

  body: "Yes!  It IS Impuls!  Your font knowledge is insanely impressive!  Just curious,
    did you know that because you've used it yourself before and went through the
    hunt or do you just know a lot about every font imaginable?!\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Amelie
    IS delightful :-)\r\n\r\nThank you again for all your time and help.\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: "Hmm ... the answer to this question was always Champion \u2013 like Paul
    said \u2013 so I was curious what was afoot here.\r\n\r\nTurns out that your cover
    image, Dave, is NOT the original that we are always shown. <a href=\"http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/11647/85002\"
    target=\"_blank\">This is</a>. And that is Champion. Impuls is delightful, too,
    though."

    adaptation of the DVD box fails to ask for our help. :-)"

  body: "Yes, I was aware that the UK version of the cover is quite different from
    the original, Japanese-made one.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd read elsewhere that it was
    actually Champion but couldn't even find that font anywhere!  So I just tried
    my hand here using the UK cover but I'm very pleased with the result.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone actually have an idea of where I can download Champion?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nDave"

    you want it is available at <a href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90056.html\"
    target=\"new\">Berthold</a>.\r\n\r\nI went for Champion at first, but it didn't
    match the sample you showed us. Impuls did.\r\n\r\nBut also, just curious, did
    most of you assume it was Champion based on your knowlege of the original, and
    just gave David's sample a cursury glance?\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

  body: heh, i knew it didn't look quite right. but my brain just automatically put
    Amelie and Champion together. Guess i should have not just glossed over it. Nice
    catch Mr. InStyle!
