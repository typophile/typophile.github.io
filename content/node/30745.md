  body: I'm not familiar with Albro, my book on Brodovitch is at home. Can you post
    a sample? Perhaps with a sample we might know it under a different name.

  body: 'Yes that''s the face I was thinking of. Do you ever look at www.showstudio.com?
    I''m a HUGE Nick Knight fan so I keep up with his work there. I saw this type
    on the site for one of the projects and have been lusting after it ever since.
    Looks like a fellow named Paul Barnes had something to do with the type. I don''t
    know him but I''ve heard from an old co-worker that he''s expensive so it figures
    that Nick Knight would work with him! http://www.showstudio.com/projects/blumenfeld/ '

  body: And... hold on a second. In the book <em>Typography -- When, Who, How</em>
    (edited by Friedl, Ott, and Stein), it is listed as Abro, not AlBro. Same goes
    for the website <a href="http://www.suedkamp.com/04_whoiswho/04_kuenstler_brodovitch-alexey_content.htm">type
    hype</a>... Are they all talking about the same typeface?

  body: "In Portfolio #1 from 1950 (you can see the scan of a facsimile in ALJ's post),
    it is referred to als <em>Albro,</em> short for Alexey Brodovitch. In the Brodovitch
    book by Kerry William Purcell (from which ALJ scanned the facsimile, I suppose),
    it is called <em>Al-bro.</em> Nico Schweizer's 1992 revival <em>Albroni</em> (released
    by Lineto) can be found here: http://www.lineto.com/1.0/content_36.html\r\n\r\nSorry
    for the late response. :-)"
