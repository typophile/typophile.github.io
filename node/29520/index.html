  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have just spoken to an NPR Radio producer who is soon doing a program on the useage of [[script]] type in our era. She called to ask me to participate from the point of view of a designer. I would like to gather more than just my perspective so I am posing the question here in hopes other graphic designers and typographers would contribute their input as well. Some of the questions/concepts she posed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is script dead and should we do away with it?</li>
<li>What are particularly good and bad uses of script?</li>
<li>Has our society tended to use script more or less during difficult economic times?</li>
<li>How has the computer affected the use of script?</li>
<li>How do you feel about mail that you get which is really handwritten? Do you read it first?</li>
<li>How about junk mail that is faked to look like handwritten just to make you think it is personal mail?</li>
<li>Where is script going in the future?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would also say that you can add whatever comments you mighjt have regarding script that don&rsquo;t fit the above questions.  I am just trying to get a feel for the &ldquo;word on the street&rdquo; as well.</p>
<p>Any helpful comments welcomed,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>1. Is script dead and should we do away with it?</em> No and no (unless we&rsquo;re making emoticons in Zapfino)
<em>2. What are particularly good and bad uses of script?</em> See above:) I don&rsquo;t think script is any worse or better for its abuse than any other form of type, except for all caps use.
<em>3. Has our society tended to use script more or less during difficult economic times?</em> I suspect yes.
<em>4. How has the computer affected the use of script?</em> It has allowed Tom, Dick and Harry to fontify their own handwriting.
<em>5. How do you feel about mail that you get which is really handwritten? Do you read it first?</em> Yes, every time.
<em>6. How about junk mail that is faked to look like handwritten just to make you think it is personal mail?</em> I recently had something from Sky TV which was very well faked, but on the whole it gets binned almost as fast as anything else, especially if the names of sender or sendee are the only ones rendered in script.
<em>7. Where is script going in the future?</em> Technologies like OpenType will allow handwriting to have an infinite variety of contextual pairs so it will be harder to detect computer generated script.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t see any branch of type dying &hellip; if so, it would be textura and the like. (Although we can always dream of Comic Sans dying). Script will always hold a place where the &ldquo;formal announcement&rdquo; effect is desired.</p>
<p>That said, creating a newspaper or direct mail advertisement in script that creates the look of an invitation, when all they are inviting me to is a chance for them to flog their product at me, won&rsquo;t work. I reject advertising and other communications that attempt to trick me.</p>
<p>Bad uses of script: do you mean when an amateur likes the capitals, so they give us Park Avenue in full caps? Good uses of script: I particularly like the scripts that give a wide range of options, like Shelley, or Poetica, which allow a designer to select from numerous intial and terminal characters to make a piece that says exactly what they want it to.</p>
<p>I think the computer impact on script is enormous. Now everyone can create it, while 20 years ago you hired a calligrapher, or spent years learning the skill itself. So script has been opened to the masses, and now is easily attainable. Fortunately, it has not seemed to been over used. (Unless you count oversaturation of Zapf Chancery Medium Italic, which is not really a script at all.)</p>
<p>As for the effect of handwriting fonts (is that the same as script?) I tend to like them less than formal scripts. I would limit their use greatly, to situations where true handwriting is needed (and that is not in advertising). It could be cool in movie or television credits, with the text being animated to appear to be hand written, but only once. The second guy to do it will appear so very derivative.</p>

<p>Don,
I think she is after good and bad uses of script as a choice for a design by a graphic designer, not good or badly designed scripts.
An example of a bad use of a script would be for a highway sign. A good use might be for a wedding invitation or a baseball team logo&ndash;that sort of thing.</p>

<li>I&rsquo;ll go with more no-nos tracking out connecting scripts, setting conneting scripts on a circle (although i&rsquo;ve done this! it takes some work to get it right). Script is bad in the same way any other typestyle is bad: when it&rsquo;s inappropriate.</li>
<li>no idea</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s made good penmanship available to the computer-using masses.</li>
<li>love it. yes. it means it&rsquo;s from a real person and they&rsquo;re thinking about you particularly as they write (none of this form letter stuff)</li>
<li>doesn&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>i think the script genre especially lends itself to taking advantage of OT bells and whistles. the variability made possible with contextual substitutions means that script fonts can be more natural and more lively. however, i think the market for hand lettering will stay strong as discerning clients will appreciate the value of hand-crafted, bespoke lettering.</li>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think &lsquo;script&rsquo; and &lsquo;cursive&rsquo; are misplaced here - largely by the show OpenSource. Chris, you&rsquo;re talking about handwriting right? If I&rsquo;m to follow the summary on the OpenSource website, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re interested in the erosion of handwriting and the rise email and blogging as a primary means of &lsquo;written&rsquo; communication. But that&rsquo;s just a guess&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That was my impression too after following your link, which was what stopped me going back and editing my comments, because, on further thought, they were too related to handwriting. 
I think the answer to the question about economic conditions would, as a cynical response, be yes, with thoughts of manipulating the preparedness of people to open and read a handwritten communication, the slant of the questions seem to me to be about direct mail as much as handwriting.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The questions I wrote at the top came out of my phone conversation with NPR.  I think she was pushing beyond the handwriting only thing.  I think she saw that &ldquo;Death of Cursive&rdquo; thread here on Typophile and that is where she got my name for this &ldquo;second part&rdquo; of the broadcast. When she was asking me questions, it was all framed for a graphic designers perspective. I talked about people like Ben Shawn who used handwritten text in his design work, She specifically asked about Esquire Magazine and the script used for the logo.  We mostly talked about script in print, not handwritong in schools.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s simply because [she knew] you&rsquo;re a graphic designer. Journalists work like that. The real point of public interest here can only really be the death of the act of writing by hand - anything else can only be allowed to feed into that in the end.</p>
<p>Point her to this:

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>1. Is script dead and should we do away with it?</em></p>
<p>NO and NO! I think the deluge of handwriting fonts tell us that people WANT script, but just don&rsquo;t see a big difference between handwriting/ handwriting fonts. They still try to say the same thing these days: AUTHENTICITY.</p>
<p><em>2. What are particularly good and bad uses of script?</em></p>
<p>Good Script Type: hmmm&hellip;.Wedding Invites?  There are plenty of examples&hellip;. but I always find myself asking, What were they trying to achieve and Why didn&rsquo;t they just write it?</p>
<p>Bad Script: Solicitations trying to &ldquo;look&rdquo; handwritten, but obviously aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><em>3. Has our society tended to use script more or less during difficult economic times?</em></p>
<p>Interesting question&hellip;. I think script is used now to create a sense of authenticity, nostalgia&hellip; Script was very popular in post-War advertising for new consumer goods&hellip;Perhaps as a way to connect people to these new consumer goods to connote &ldquo;affordable luxuries&rdquo;&hellip;.</p>
<p><em>4. How has the computer affected the use of script?</em>
How HASN&rsquo;T it? The compuer has eradicated the necessity of script in almost everyway. Now, script is used for decoration, rather than just communication. The roles have reversed, in a way.</p>
<p><em>5. How do you feel about mail that you get which is really handwritten? Do you read it first? </em></p>
<p>Yes, definetly. I know that a handwritten piece of mail is likely from a person I actually know (although it is usually a thank you card from one of the myriad of weddings and showers I have recently attended, financially bleeding me dry&hellip; And yet, we EXPECT these thank you notes to be handwritten, that the person will take the &ldquo;extra effort&rdquo; to write it by hand.)</p>
<p><em>6. How about junk mail that is faked to look like handwritten just to make you think it is personal mail?</em></p>
<p>When I first started to notice this, it really fascinated me. Now, I find it patronizing. Do they think I actually believe this is handwriring? 
And yet, we see this all the time in advertising and solicitation. I think there is a blurred line between script and handwriting fonts that imitate script. In a sense, both signify authenticity.</p>
<p><em>7. Where is script going in the future?</em></p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll continue see more sophisticated handwriting fonts. This is one of my personal theories, but I think the average blogger/chat room visitor/ text messager feels the need to express themselves with the fonts they chose, in the same way they could/would have previously done with their speech or with their handwriting. We are having written conversations now that would have previously been conducted verbally. This takes on a whole new meaning for the idea of typing and conversation&hellip;.i think digital handwriting (or fonts that mimic handwriting, or ways that users invent to mimic personal expression) will fit into this in the future somehow&hellip;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>1. Is script dead and should we do away with it?</cite>
Mostly yes, and it&rsquo;s no great loss. Having multiple alphabets for a single language simply to impart certain written documents with an air of importance is silly. The world has changed dramatically since script writing was developed, and we simply have more important things to teach kids, not to mention remember. Most people don&rsquo;t have a clue how to write—or in the cases of some variants even read—blackletter, and civilization seems to be no worse off.
<cite>2. What are particularly good and bad uses of script?</cite>
Good? Retro-1950s stuff, like Christina Aguilera&rsquo;s latest album art. Bad is all of the horrible overuse of Zapfino on rap albums, because it just contributes to the minstrel show that is contemporary hip-hop.
<cite>3. Has our society tended to use script more or less during difficult economic times?</cite>
I&rsquo;m not old or expert enough to answer that one.
<cite>4. How has the computer affected the use of script?</cite>
If it wasn&rsquo;t for the computer, I might not use it at all. I really only started using it again after being inspired by the some script designs from House Industries. 
<cite>5. How do you feel about mail that you get which is really handwritten? Do you read it first?</cite>
I get handwritten mail about once every other year, so it&rsquo;s a moot point.
<cite>6. How about junk mail that is faked to look like handwritten just to make you think it is personal mail?</cite>
I&rsquo;m not in the demographic that gets such mailings.
<cite>7. Where is script going in the future?</cite>
In the short term, brush script is about to explode as 1950s retro design kicks in. Long term, it&rsquo;s going to go the way of Calligraphy—a hobby for type nerds and wedding invitation designers—and in the very long term it&rsquo;s going to disappear almost entirely.</div>
