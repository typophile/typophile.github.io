  body: "Thanks, Bob. Sadly, though, I don't see the similarity.\r\n\r\nAny other
    takers? It looks strangely familiar to me, but I'm not deep enough in this world
    for the association to be reliably stored in my brain.\r\n\r\nEdit: AHA! Wait,
    no. The /P/R/ remind me of http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/dutch-mediaeval/
    , but there's little else in common. A clue, but not a conclusion.\r\n\r\nEdit2:
    Further clues. In the Dutch Mediaeval direction, there's Erasmus http://www.identifont.com/similar?7NF
    and Roos http://www.identifont.com/similar?209L but that's stretching further
    and further. That trail ends there. But on another direction, there's:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Goudy

    - http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-powell/</li>\r\n<li>and best match:
    Pabst Oldstyle - http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-pabst-oldstyle/</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n...which
    also led me to Belucian - http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/belucian/\r\n\r\nAm
    I close to cracking the case? Someone here knows more about this than I!"

  body: "Based on the information found so far, the best prospect is to think about
    fonts similar to Pabst Old Style, by F. W. Goudy. That's not the font, but the
    style is very close. It has many of the features that Goudy repeated in many fonts
    -- he was prolific to say the least. Many of his fonts are not digitized. Some
    info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_designed_by_Frederic_Goudy\r\nI
    suspect that this font could perhaps be Goudy's Powell of 1903, produced by the
    Keystone Foundry. Mr. Powell, who was working at the time as advertising manager
    for the Mandel Brothers company commissioned the font and it was named after him.
    Powell had previously commissioned a font for another company. That font became
    Pabst Old Style.\r\nAs this was a private font, a specimen is not available from
    the usual sources. But I expect it can be found.\r\nThis might be a false lead.
    Lanston Type Company has digitized a font called Powell which does not match Steffmann's
    Powell Antique. Won't know  until we find a specimen of Goudy's Powell of 1903.\r\nThere
    is at least one web pages reporting the progress of digitizing Goudy's fonts.
    http://www.goudyfonts.com/shop-numerical/\r\nAn alternative is that the font was
    made by a competitor at BB&s OR elsewhere working in Goudy's style.\r\nDon"

    looks as if it's distressed too.\r\n\r\nOh, yes - looking for the original, I
    instead found Pabst Oldstyle itself in the 1906 ATF catalog, and it is distressed,
    so for regular faces of that type I'd have to go even further back."

  body: "In the late 1890s foundries started producing some fonts in a style called
    \"rugged\" which to our 21st century eye look \"distressed\" and we expect that
    there was a smooth font that was distorted. But circa 1900  the rugged fonts were
    produced as originals to give the impression of being produced by an artist on
    rough paper, or roughly cut by a punch cutter. Smooth versions of these typefaces
    were neither produced nor expected. This was part of the movement to replace \"artistic\"
    and \"aesthetic\" typefaces that had been in vogue for about 20 years with a new
    generation of typefaces that said, vigorous, virile and rugged This  coincided
    with a cultural shift to imperialism, empire and \"manly expression.\" \r\nSome
    well researched books describe the change, e.g. Clouse's _Handy Book of Artistic
    Printing_ (2009).\r\nNote that the shift to rugged fonts was for the the part
    of the typeface market that was mainly advertisers who wanted display fonts that
    looked like strong handwritten statements and had the other qualities mentioned.
    This was the field for Morris ,  Goudy and the like. \r\nFor the book market the
    change was to stronger, i.e. darker, typefaces that achieved mechanical regularity
    by use of new punch cutting machines that produced type designed fort the new
    type compositing machines.\r\nI am attempting to describe a complex set of changes
    in a relatively short post, a real challenge and clearly neglects important aspects.
    For example, I could have said more about Morris and his effect, but this was
    recently discussed at length in http://typophile.com/node/114418\r\nDon\r\nDon"

  body: "Outstanding!\r\n\r\nYour link to the wikipedia article was a big help. It's
    also a big help to understand that there was a stylistic trend for \"rugged\"
    fonts at one point, and that they weren't at the time thought of as \"distressed.\"\r\n\r\nI
    don't think it's necessary, for my client's purposes, for a type specimen of Goudy's
    1903 \"Powell\" to be found. I'd certainly be interested to see one, just for
    the comparison, but there's no budget for anything like a revival.\r\n\r\nI'm
    about to recommend Goudy 38, Goudy's \"Village\", or (for a different direction)
    Roos (or Dutch Mediaeval/Erasmus if they want something darker). I don't think
    we're going to find what I'd think of as a \"perfect match\" for this display
    font... I'm just gonna have to make some thing \"work well enough.\"\r\n\r\nTHANKS
    for the great information."

    a character set:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avil@ATF1912Excerpts_6696.jpg]\r\nVery
    nice \"rugged\" font that differs from all of the typefaces mentioned so far.
    Note the variations in letter-forms between point sizes. Obviously each point
    size was cut by hand as a separate font.\r\nThe search continues.\r\nDon\r\n"
