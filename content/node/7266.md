  body: If it is Apex Sans &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/apex-sans/medium-t/testdrive.html?s=Fidelidade+Mundial&amp;p=48">Medium</a>,
    I guess&#41;, the i and l have been modified or redrawn.

  body: Yeah, you&#39;re right about the discrepancies. I didn&#39;t even notice because
    the g and e were so obviously apex that I never stopped to compare before posting.
    I suppose it wasn&#39;t very difficult to redraw the l considering that it&#39;s
    a rectangle.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
