  body: "If you make the slopes of your lines a quotient of integers (for example
    2/5) instead of degrees (which is in fact a spurious measure in digital type design)
    you'll have a much easier time, because you can predict/control the thickness
    of the lines by relying on fixed point movements.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: A 610,000 unit em seems excessive, even for the reasons you describe. For
    instance, given an output device with 3000 dpi resolution (typical high resolution),
    a 10-inch tall character would be rasterized to no more than 30,000 pixels, less
    than 1/20th of the available resolution in your font. You would not reach a one-to-one
    ratio until the character was over 20 inches tall. Go ahead and use 610,000 if
    you can, but 30,000 will probably be enough, and well within FontLab's limits.
    I seriously doubt whether the difference will be visible, or even measurable,
    on typical output devices.

  body: "<em>what minimal set of characters can I get away with</em>\r\n\r\nIf you
    name it, say, \"Tape Initials\" or \"Tape Titling\", then it will be clear to
    users that it doesn't have a full character set -- certainly not lower case.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be in good company with Forum, Trajan, etc.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The UPM size in the OpenType/TrueType specification is limited to 65,535.
    That is a limitation of the format. However, point coordinates in FontLab Studio
    are also limited to 65,635, which is a limitation of our application. Therefore,
    it's impractical to work even at a UPM size of anything close to 65,535. However,
    I pretty much feel that a UPM size of 10,000 should be OK for you. If not, try
    20,000 or 30,000. \r\n\r\nA."
