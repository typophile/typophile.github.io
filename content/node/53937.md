  body: "I also spotted Glenlake (ad with the headline \"CHANGE -- INGREDIENT OF PROGRESS\").\r\n\r\nI
    did a double, and then a triple take when I saw this slide:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/proportionalscale_3728.jpg]\r\n\r\n1.
    It looks like a White Stripes CD cover.\r\n\r\n2. The gizmo in the guy's hand
    is a Scaleograph, an aid for sizing photos and art that was commonplace before
    computers made their way into design studios.\r\n\r\n3. According to the narrator,
    the guy in the photo, New Orleans designer Bob Brandt, invented it.\r\n\r\nI still
    have one of these hanging in my office for sentimental reasons. Sure enough, in
    small print it says: MFD. BY THE BRANDT CORP., NEW ORLEANS, LA."

    kind of a clock that may be?\u201D, then I realized that the image is mirrored
    ;-)  NO, THIS WAS NOT DONE IN A MIRROR, EACH CHARACTER WAS STRUNG FROM THE CEILING
    WITH FISHING LINE, I  VISIT PERIODICALLY WITH DON SMITH WHO PRODUCED THIS AND
    2 VISITS AGO HE TOLD ME HOW HE DID THIS SHOT.  THIS WAS ORIGINALLY A 35MM SLIDE
    SHOW WITH SYNCED REEL-TO-REEL AUDIO TAPE.  EACH SLIDE WAS ADVANCED (BY HAND WITH
    THE SLIDE PROJECTOR \"CLICKER\") ACCORDING TO A SCRIPT WHICH I HAVE.  THIS WAS
    PRODUCED  IN 1962.\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIO WAS CONSERVED THEN CONVERTED TO DIGITAL BY
    SETH WINNER STUDIO IN LONG ISLAND AND THE 140, 35MM SLIDES WERE SCANNED HERE.
    \ EACH FILE IS ABOUT 80M BECAUSE, SOMEDAY, WE'D LOVE TO CREATE A BOOK.\r\n\r\n>MARK,
    I REMEBER THE GIZMO, TOO.  I'M SURE I BROKE THE ONE I USED BACK IN THE LATE 70s."

  body: "Hi Nancy,\r\n\r\nI think Bonobo meant that the image you posted above is
    flopped (backwards). It's correctly oriented in the slide show video.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    Filmotype was a headline setting machine that was popular in art studios in the
    late fifties through the sixties. I and some others have been reviving Filmotype
    typefaces over the last year or so.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.filmotype.com/\r\n\r\nThanks
    so much for posting the video. I really enjoyed it."

  body: "Hi Mark,\r\n\r\nI have the original one-line specimen Photo-Lettering book
    and lived by it way back when. I still think its organization is brilliant, by
    style.  Its such a good way to learn to recognize type too. \r\n\r\nFor a while
    I would take Bob Rose out to lunches hoping to get the masters from him but he
    kept making noises about expecting a million bucks compensation for letting it
    go.  Eventually the smart kids at House Industries got the collection.  \r\n\r\nI
    love that you'all are converting other Filmtype typefaces."
