body: "i would like to take the opportunity and ask for some advice/corrections in
  regard to the following project:\r\n\r\na while ago i had downloaded the free font
  \"say it fat\" by timo titzmann -- http://www.id84.de/type/say-it-fat/\r\n\r\nwhile
  i like the style a lot, the original is very basic (~95 glyphs). i thus decided
  to overhaul the typeface and have completed the following codepages (the font is
  lowercase only):\r\n\r\n0000 - c0 controls and basic latin\r\n0080 - c1 controls
  and latin-1 supplement\r\n0100 - latin extended-a\r\n\r\ncyrillic is almost completed
  and greek and vietnamese latin are in the works, too. however, as this is my first
  font work proper and i am no type designer, there are loads of issues -- but it's
  a start.\r\n\r\n-> <strong>\u0111</strong> and <strong>\u0127</strong> need to be
  worked on, but the low ascender is a big problem here -- suggestions on how to handle
  it are very welcome. it would also influence the design of the cyrillic glyphs <strong>\u045B</strong>
  and <strong>\u0452</strong>.\r\n\r\nany feedback, tips, and/or help is appreciated
  (weird looking characters, inconsistency in design/appearance or the like).\r\n\r\nthe
  original author has been contacted and has expressed interest in a possible update.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ec977ecf_3975.png]"

    too, but these are the most used in Italian).\r\nMaking them narrower could help
    to increase their angle too."

  body: "thanks for the feedback -- this was actually the one thing i planned on keeping,
    as i had tried out shorter diacritics, but they didn't look good to me.\r\n\r\nin
    addition to that, vietnamese and other extended latin characters stack diacritics
    which effectively restricts using steep inclines or declines -- here's an example
    to illustrate what i mean (pinyin tones -- macron, acute and caron on top of dieresis):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SayItFat-uni01D8_3887.png]\r\n\r\nanother
    problem would be that i'd have to change the dot accent and dieresis as well in
    order to maintain distinctiveness, as the other accents are based on them and
    it would disrupt the overall appearance -- but i will consider adding alternatives,
    thanks again for the suggestion. updates to follow."

    quite think percent works as a nut fraction.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably have to start
    over with the eszett after you've learned more about it.\r\n\r\nBut a really good
    job on such things as the section sign, pilcrow, asterisk..."

    ;-)\r\nSeriously, I think that designing diacritics for a display face such as
    this one presents even more trade-offs than usual.\r\nOverall, it seems that you
    are concentrating more on an aesthetic model and less on actual usage and recognisability.\r\nCode-point
    completeness is a vain goal if the result isn't usable.\r\nMake those accents
    fat! :-)\r\nBy the way, in this style of type, diacritics often reach above the
    ascenders. There are also several threads on the topic of diacritics, and about
    vietnamese ones (http://www.google.com/search?q=vietnamese+diacritics+site%3Atypophile.com)."

    an hard time with the kreska</cite></strong>\r\ni have a hard time with the entire
    font so far ... i think the kreska aspect is something way beyond my scope, requiring
    glyph substitution and ot programming (i'm just an interested layman). i will
    probably have to sacrifice typographic accuracy in this case.\r\n\r\n<strong><cite>1.
    Overall, it seems that you are concentrating more on an aesthetic model and less
    on actual usage and recognisability. 2. Code-point completeness is a vain goal
    if the result isn't usable.</cite></strong>\r\n1. i don't know if the two are
    really mutually exclusive. 2. i'm a completist, there's no way this will change
    anytime soon.\r\nas a matter of fact, i had made a pdf specimen with sample paragraphs
    in various languages -- it looked alright to me in croat, german and french (which
    i speak). but you have a valid point nonetheless.\r\n\r\nthe pdf (italian included,
    plus a number of other languages, eastern and western european):\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?iof46nel7jxun1y\r\n\r\n<strong><cite>Make
    those accents fat! :-)</cite></strong>\r\nalright, alright! consider it on the
    list. this means i will have to start over again ... wonderful (especially if
    i take into account how anal i am about never letting go of unifinished things).\r\n\r\nwhat
    bothers me more than the accents right now is still the way the \u0111 (croat
    d) and the \u0127 (h bar) turned out.\r\n\r\n<strong><cite>The acute and grave
    could be better distinguished if you cut them in half and made the low end start
    at or near the center of the letter.</cite></strong>\r\nas written above, i'll
    make an alternative version with heavy diacritics. the original had three characters
    with diacritics (strictly speaking there are five, with the i and the j): \xE4,
    \xF6 and \xFC -- i took their design as the starting point for the others.\r\n\r\n<strong><cite>You'll
    probably have to start over with the eszett after you've learned more about it.</cite></strong>\r\nkevin,
    i'm german.\r\nbut if you mean typographic conventions, then you're correct. the
    current shape has been a deliberate decision (which doesn't mean that it's right
    -- i happened to like the flow of the form coalescing). thanks!"

    the eszett, then, even if it is meant to be a creative departure from the norm.

    really -- the fact that i'm a native speaker doesn't mean anything in this context
    -- as i wrote in my initial post, i am no type designer (or any kind of designer
    -- i'm from the legal field ... doh!), so more likely than not, i have blatantly
    ignored or rather gratuitously broken fundamental rules. it looks nice to me --
    but then again, many people don't mind using the acute or even grave accent in
    lieu of an apostrophe ... hence, no worries -- if in doubt, it's a mistake on
    my part."

    you are upgrading it the latin2 and more!\r\n\r\ni'm german - hence an eszett
    native speacker:-)\r\n\r\nyour \"\u017F-s\"-combination is too wide, beacause
    it looks still like two gyphs. that'n not bad, beacsue it originaly was a ligature
    once, but up to know it's an single gyph.\r\n\r\ni like your variant which makes
    the \"\xDF\" look more than a \"\u017F-s\" than a \"B\".\r\n\r\nif you are interested,
    here is a similar idea, which i had for my [[http://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/graphit/]]:\r\n[[http://26plus-zeichen.de/wp-content/uploads/german-s_suggestion_for_say-it-fat.gif
