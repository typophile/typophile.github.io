  body: "Ok, so I've figured it out, yes, this font, called Clash (by COMA), uses
    Times Roman and Helvetica.\r\n\r\nFrom the Washington Post:\r\nThe designers at
    a tiny graphic-design firm called Coma, based in Brooklyn and Amsterdam, were
    invited to design the typeface that's used on all the Triennial's wall labels
    and text panels and throughout the exhibition catalogue, also entirely designed
    by Coma.\r\n\r\nComa's typeface is so smart and effective, and based on such a
    simple idea, that it must have other designers green with envy: Coma has simply
    taken the world's two most popular fonts, Times New Roman and Helvetica, and mashed
    them up to make a new family of letter forms called Clash. In Clash -- shown at
    right -- Coma founders Cornelia Blatter and Marcel Hermans print all of a text's
    vowels in Times New Roman, the classic typeface based on models at least 250 years
    old; it ends all the swelling lines that constitute its letters in a little flourish
    called a serif. Coma then sets all the consonants in that same text in Helvetica,
    which is the great example of a sans-serif font, where the modern lines that make
    up letters are uniform, muscular and entirely undecorated.\r\n\r\n...more at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030900474_pf.html\r\n\r\nIshan

    another sort of mash-up -- a bit more subtle, perhaps. Did Carlos Segura have
    to pay for the rights? Did Max Kisman, when he created <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_fudoni/\"><strong>Fudoni</strong></a>?

    faces doesn't really seem like much of a creative effort, even if the result is
    kind of pleasing.

    Clash a <em>picard\xEDa</em>; which translates as a kind of prank or mischief
    -- so, yes, I do agree with you both, Stephen and Chuck!\r\n\r\nI also have to
    say that combining serif and sans serif letterforms is not new in graphic design
    -- I remember it being done to many logos during the 1980s."

    Life Now'' are the two new fonts, Clash Sans and Clash, designed by COMA for use
    in the exhibition's catalog and labels. Both fonts simply combine the two existing,
    classically opposed fonts Times Roman and sans-serif Helvetica -- using one for
    consonants and the other for vowels. Despite the comfortingly familiar elements,
    the fonts look as a whole like nothing you've quite seen before.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    wonder which newspaper didn't get the facts straight? As for <a href=\"http://comalive.com/\"><strong>COMA</strong></a>,
    their website and work ain't too shabby. You could look at Clash as a mischievous
    in-joke made by a couple of designers for other designers."
