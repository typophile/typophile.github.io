  is the font my company uses for its logo. I'm unable to ask anyone because I don't
  know who draws it and where, since I'm not in the same country as the head offices
  are !\r\n\r\nSo it would be nice if someone among you can tell me what the font
  is ...\r\n\r\nThanks a lot !!!\r\n\r\nMarc\r\n\r\n[[http://www.nieuwslog.nl/wp-content/plugins/wp-o-matic/cache/50390_20090625123849_nl_arcadis.jpg]]"
