  body: "Good finds Kevin. To my eye Barmeno Bold is perhaps closest. It has about
    the right proportions and right degree of rounded corners. Main difference is
    that the SW to NE strokes are a little too thick. Sharpen some corners and notch
    the _T_ and it's pretty close. But Seconda Soft Bold is also good. Same comments.\r\nDon"
