body: "I was recently challenged to refresh a corporate identity for a mental health
  training organisation. The brand currently uses Arial (!) exclusively. Body copy,
  headlines. Everything. After a few blissful days of research, I came up with \r\n\r\nGesta
  Regular \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/r-type/gesta/ as a text typeface and\r\n\r\nSommet
  Rounded Black \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sommet-slab-rounded/black/
  for headlines. \r\n\r\nI was quite happy with this solution; the slightly quirky
  Sommet Rounded looks quite nice with the easy, friendly elegance of Gesta. Everyone
  loved this pair. Until we consulted with IT.\r\n\r\nBecause the client uses Word
  to produce so much of their internal communications, it was determined that bringing
  in an \"outside font\" for body copy would be too complicated (and expensive). And
  so now I've been asked to choose a typeface from the Microsoft Office suite to pair
  with Sommet Rounded Black for their corporate identity (business cards, pamphlets,
  posters, etc.).\r\n\r\nI need a sans serif with a few different weights, and unfortunately,
  there isn't much choice. At this point, I'm thinking about choosing Segoe and calling
  it a day, but I'm wondering if anyone out there has an ideas. "

  body: I think the only typeface that comes in more than than the basic two weights
    in MS Office is good old stalwart Franklin Gothic, which has three plus condensed
    versions and italics.

    in harmonising text with headlines."

  body: "Interesting about Franklin being the only font with multiple weights. Wonder
    what the story is behind that? Both Segoe and Calibri have regular and bold weights
    in InDesign, so as long as I, the designer, have access to these, I can leave
    the client with their Microsoft-generated weights for producing documents in Word.
    \r\n\r\nRiccard0, I did consider Calibri as a match for Sommet. It seems like
    a good pair, although I do hesitate to use a typeface that also happens to be
    the default for Microsoft programs. Sigh. It's the old argument, rehashed over
    and over again: Why can't clients see the value in individuating themselves through
    typeface choices? (Oh right, they all look the same anyway.) I am floored that
    I would be asked to create a distinctive identity for a brand using fonts so generic
    and overused they practically blend into the table. "
