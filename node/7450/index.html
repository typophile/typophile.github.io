		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Shawn, <BR>I just noticed that &#34;leg&#34; missing from the mark also. I would love to work on some abstract marks, but unfortunately the previous design firm has seared this mark into their corporate identity. I just hope I can &#34;sell&#34; this redesign. <BR> <BR>So far Bembo Small Caps has been the only type to catch my eye. I&#39;m looking for a conservative established type face and this seemed to be most &#34;solid&#34;. Coming from an illustrative background, my type face knowledge is sophomoric at best &#40;compared to some people on this board :o&#41; <BR> <BR>Right now I&#39;m not 100% certain about the treatment and letter-spacing.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello! <BR>This looks good! <BR> <BR>I think with some work on the kerning, #4 could come to look very good &#40;right now I think it looks a little bit too spaced&#41;. <BR>But of course, it depends on how you want people to read the name. Each one gives a different tone to the reading. #4 is my personal favorite because the caps separates the words so that it doesn&#39;t look like the company&#39;s name is &#34;wintergroup&#34;. Maybe you could also try a variation on #3 with a &#40;small&#41; space between Winter and Group. Maybe put the title a little more to the right, to separate it from the big W mark, and then add the space between the words, so that &#34;Group&#34; won&#39;t feel lost from the rest.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">#3 is best for me, though the &#34;the&#34; doens&#39;t seem to fit.  did you try it in all caps too?  or maybe just move it--i dont think it looks right sitting on top of the W.  i really don&#39;t like that W mark when it&#39;s small.  i wish you didn&#39;t have to keep that. <BR> <BR>also, try playing more with the placement of the W next to the type.  it could be too &#34;easy&#34; where it is now.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really like the third one there. If they use their initials &#40;WG&#41; at all it&#39;s perfect. <BR>If they don&#39;t I&#39;d be tempted to emphasise &#39;WINTER&#39; over &#39;the&#39; and &#39;group&#39; more, as Daniel says. <BR> <BR>What would it look like if you took the second one from your &#34;November 01, 2004 - 1:27 pm&#34; post and set &#39;GROUP&#39; in lc and italics like &#39;the&#39; and put it under &#39;WINTER&#39;. Then set &#39;group&#39; flush with the right edge of &#39;WINTER&#39;. If you tweak the logo to get the heights even &#40;ish&#41; then it could look good I think. <BR> <BR>EDIT: ha! just realised I described number 1. However, I&#39;d go with that concept, but make the relative sizes of &#39;group&#39; and WINTER more like number 3 from that post. <BR> <BR>Some nice ideas so far.&#60;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Because &#34;W&#34; mark is so complex, I think you need to focus on keeping your type treatment simple. <BR> <BR>Every differentiation you introduce within the type &#40;italic to Small Caps, small type to large to small, different alignments&#41; adds a component that the person interacting with the logo has to deal with. The immediacy of the entire name is compromised when the viewer is confronted with too many variations/elements in addition to the leap you are asking them to make from the &#34;W&#34; mark to the logotype.  <BR> <BR>I like your move to center the &#34;W&#34; mark above the name &#40;the mark on the left reveals the awkward W W moment&#41;, and I would try &#34;the Winter Group&#34; all the same size, on the same line, small caps with the W and the G regular caps, with a little word spacing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for the input, I&#39;m glad to see there&#39;s a forum like this.  <BR> <BR>Justin - You&#39;re right, I was trying too hard to veer away from the current logo&#39;s vertical layout &#40;just to avoid any similarity&#41;, which was a mistake. The other layout/type treatments try too hard to work and I realize a vertical layout probably is the best solution for maximum legibiltiy. The centering of the elements eliminates the WW effect and also gives a better placement for &#34;the&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Oscar - I&#39;m still campaigning fiercely to get the go-ahead to propose a replacement for the &#34;W&#34; mark; stating that it does not scale and reproduce well, etc. I&#39;ve always been fond of the saying &#34;A good logo should be so structurally clean that it can be drawn in the sand&#34;, which doesn&#39;t really hold true for the &#34;W&#34;. <BR> <BR>I would love to take a crack at a new mark, but with our new office being completed in January and signage and collateral scheduled to be produced, I would have to try to find the time to crank out some concepts. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53254.gif" alt=""></div>
