  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was listening to the radio the other night. A musician  <BR>was talking about making music. He sounded a little out <BR> of it, he was rambling a little, but had a good point to <BR> make. He mentioned the state of pop music, the rigidly <BR> enforced planned obsolesence of it and how his music  <BR>was trying to be as honest as possible. Authentic. He  <BR>then said &#40;bear with me&#41; something like this: &#34;I mean, it  <BR>shouldn&#39;t be about the money, the profile, the cd  <BR>packaging marketing and cool music videos. It is about  <BR>the art, because at the end of it all, it is all we leave  <BR>behind. Honest art.&#34; <BR> <BR>I thought immediately of type, specifically of type  <BR>design. What is the attraction of a largely thankless  <BR>task appreciated by few yet exposed to many? I think I  <BR>am hooked because it can be honest. Other people  <BR>can use your type, and something very real and  <BR>useable is &#39;left behind&#39;. It is inherently narcissistic. It  <BR>would be nice to know for everyone else: why? <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am not sure of typography in its&#39; present state. I have recently discovered a version of a Latin Alphabet in transition among stone cutting in Finland. It clearly is evidence of a culture, independent of the others, finding its&#39; own place in its&#39; own world in a country with its&#39; very special tongue. <BR> <BR>Now that is gone, and probably my discovery is just one of many to be discovered all of them now dead. Why would it not be? All of them, just like in Finland, gone, gone, gone.  <BR> <BR>Typography has become a model of conformity to the false goodness of globalization which is clearly debasing cultures not merely of the tongue. <BR> <BR>Typography should slow down. Look backwards. <BR> <BR>I am not convinced that language, of which typography is part, should abrogate its <BR>responsibilities to become merely servants of commerce and fashion. To further the insatiable appetites of corporatism. My life long participation in typography was motivated by art and literature. I would prefer to leave the selling hambugers to others. <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa</div>

I&#39;ve got a book in the works that, along with its new lead typeface has been in the works for two years and will likely take another year or so before I get to print it. <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m getting at is that, even at $700 per copy &#40;100 copies&#41; I am going to top out at about $4.00 an hour.

		<div class="commentbody"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2002/09/29/bojon29.xml">David Jones</a> was an anglo-welsh poet, painter, engraver, also known for his painted inscriptions. He fought in the First World War, about which he wrote <i>In Parentheses</i>, and was one of the many British converts to Catholicism in the 1920s. He spent time at a couple of Eric Gill&#39;s guild communes, and was for a time engaged to Gill&#39;s daughter Petra, but found the solitary life better suited to his temperment. I love his stuff, especially his woodcuts. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t remember the exact source of the quote about working within the limits of one&#39;s love; it is probably from one of his essays or from his letters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There&#39;s no magic formula, but I&#39;d say you either have to: <BR>1&#41; Find an under-served niche market. <BR>2&#41; Toil away for many many years &#40;and not too much money&#41; and build a great rep. <BR>3&#41; Be extremely talented. <BR>4&#41; Be extremely lucky. <BR> <BR>I think the hope many of us from the &#34;horde outside&#34; have is that we can do type design part-time for some years &#40;and little money&#41;, elaborate our moderate talent and skills, and eventually have a decent-enough rep to at least pay for our time. And maybe get a lucky break now and again. <BR> <BR>In my case: I did #1 until it dried up, I have no patience for #2, and although I think I&#39;m luckier than average my talent is certainly not huge. So I&#39;m not expecting to make a lot of money in type any time soon. If I manage to persist -but only while I continue enjoying it- maybe one day I can make a living at it. Life is too short. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

The &#34;no money&#34; in this case may be just be shorthand for, &#34;not a fortune&#34;.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, to be honest, I am an addict, when it comes to type. I could lock myself up in the mountains, with my computer and make type all the time. And to the tempo I want. But I don&#39;t.... &#40;I have a kid and a partner&#41;. <BR> <BR>I would be a liar, if I said, I wouldn&#39;t want to make money with it. But I am realistic enough to know, that if I wanted to make bucket full of it, I&#39;d have to change a lot. Not only in the way my type should look like, but also structural. I mean, at the end, wether you sell type or graphic, you&#39;ll need to find a way to get to your potential customer. You can sit and wait till everyone notices how supperb your designs are, but this might take a while. But you can also try to get anyones attention by any means like advertisement, lobby, connections, internet, whatever. &#40;Having peoples attention doesn&#39;t mean your good in making faces, but it might mean you&#39;re good in getting attention, which is a gift&#41; You&#39;ll need a lot of energy to do this as well. And time. <BR> <BR>Because mostly, you won&#39;t make big money with type when you start, you probably will do something else for a living. So you will do your type thing during in those late nightly hours and weekends. <BR> <BR>I think, the biggest issue is time. To make a decent typeface, you need time. To make more, you more time. To sell it, too.. So it comes down to how you manage your time &#40;and your working methods&#41; and what your priorities are. <BR> <BR>--jacques</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m in this business for exactly one reason: I love type. <BR> <BR>Now, the question of how feasible it is, in general, to make a living at type design is a good one. I originally got into type wanting to be a full-time type designer. I contacted a couple of eminent folks to ask where one could go to learn about type. Both Chuck Bigelow and Robert Brunghurst were kind enough to carry on a bit of correspondence. Both of them suggested that there was little likelihood of making a living at type design. Now, I ignored that part of their advice, but I took it to heart as well, and it made me work that much harder. <BR> <BR>I should add that today I agree with them. I know quite a few type designers, and except for the very biggest names, and some employed by the large type foundries, most don&#39;t make a living at type design. They teach, or do graphic design, or other stuff to make money, and do type design because they love it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m lucky enough to work for Adobe, and get to do fun type stuff and get paid quite well. Once in a very rare while I&#39;ve even gotten to do some type design. But there are few jobs like this, and even fewer that involve actual type design, that like Bigelow and Bringhurst I find it hard to encourage people. <BR> <BR>My actual advice is this: <BR> <BR>- Decide if you could be happy doing stuff other than original type design per se. If so, there are about 5x as many opportunities. I didn&#39;t go in with this intent, but it worked out pretty well for me. <BR> <BR>- Make your own luck. This means three things: working hard as heck at your craft; going out of your way to pick up related specialized skills; spotting and exploring potential opportunities. This was a big part of how I ended up with a real paying job in type. <BR> <BR>- Learn programming. Somebody with a BSc in computer science who is also heavily into type is probably more likely to find a decent-paying type job than somebody with an MFA in design. &#40;At least, that&#39;s my perspective.&#41; It will also give you skills that will be incredibly useful in type production. <BR> <BR>Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>
