  novel comes out.  And the typography is a little \u2026 well, bland.  If you want
  to make it look genuinely beautiful and pleasurable to read, but still in keeping
  with the genre, which typeface do you first reach for? "

    wouldn't be professional, so then I thought \"I'd just turn down the job.\" But
    I realized we've set some marginally pornographic texts just because they were
    \"scholarly,\" so that answer too would be unprofessional.\r\n\r\nFinally, I decided
    if I had to take on the job, I'd just assign it to someone junior to me, and let
    them have the nightmares.\r\n\r\nIf I have to say it, my problem with Dan Brown
    is he just can't write. Actually an insult to comic sans; IIRC, some comic books
    were better written. Well, that's the best-seller market for you..."

    genre and thought it worked very well. A little more personality than the usual
    text faces, but it seemed to be the right kind of personality for a dark mystical
    race-against-death adventure. I had thought I was looking for something a bit
    constructed and artificial, and was actually surprised that something so calligraphic
    seemed the best fit."

  body: "One of those horrible distressed typewriter faces from the grunge era of
    the \u201990s. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read.\r\n\r\nSeriously?
    Minion. As bland as possible, without being Times New Roman. There\u2019s no saving
    blandity, you might as well embrace it.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re setting the special
    signed leatherbound edition, use Bembo. It feels old and classy yet very familiar,
    which is exactly what people want for a classed up version of literary drivel."
