  in the 'glyf' table define a bounding box for glyphs, I was wondering for what size
  is this bounding box given ?\r\n\r\nLet's say, if a 2000*2000 bounding box is -
  for example - for a 100 pt \"M\", then I'd like to be able to get the bounding box
  for another size with a rule of three.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help and
  your time !\r\n\r\nFrederic\r\n"

  body: "All values of this type inside a font are in 'design units' -- the 'unitsPerEm'
    value in Opentype font headers (other font types have a similar function defined
    elsewhere).\r\n\r\n\"Design units\" are a virtual construct. When you start drawing
    characters, imagine you start with a clean square sheet of paper, and you declare
    up front \"I'm going to draw all characters <em>inside</em> these boundaries.\"
    The physical size of the sheet does not matter; what does is how many <em>units</em>
    you divide it in, to be able to assign x and y coordinates to all of the individual
    points of your characters. The total size of your paper sheet is \"one em\", and
    the number of divisions is your \"units per em\" value.\r\n\r\n(So why a separate
    'bounding box'? Well, suppose you draw your average character set well inside
    the bounds of your em, but then you want to add <em>one</em> single large character
    that goes 'over the edge'. Of course you could throw everything away at that point
    and restart with a larger sheet, but at this point it's easier to step away from
    the \"sheet\" simile, and just design beyond the page boundaries. After all, it
    is just a virtual construct anyway.)\r\n\r\nTo know whether your example, a bounding
    box of 2000 \xD7 2000 units, is \"large\" or \"small\" you need to compare it
    to the em square size the font was designed on. If this would be a typical Type
    1 font, for example, its em square size could be 1000 units. That means that the
    largest character is twice as large as the em square. On the other hand, if it's
    a typical Truetype font, its em square size could be 2,048 units and that would
    make the largest character slightly <em>smaller</em> than a full em width.\r\n\r\nNote
    that none of the above tells you <em>anything</em> about the size of individual
    characters! They could fill the em square from top to bottom, or they could be
    very small.\r\n\r\nBack to your question. If you know in advance that the size
    of a 100 pt \"M\" is 2000 x 2000 design units, then you don't need to know anything
    else to calculate the bounding box \"in units\" for any other size. A 300 pt \"M\"
    will also have a bounding box of 2000 x 2000 design units. Even weirder, so will
    a 3 pt \"M\"!\r\nThat is because <em>no matter how big or small</em> you scale
    your font, design units are only virtual. If you draw a dot on your 'i' at a position
    of x=10,y=100 <em>in design units</em> and then scale that 'i' up by a factor
    of 2, the dot will still be at the position x=10,y=100 <em>in design units</em>.\r\n\r\nSo
    what about the <em>physical</em> coordinates of that dot then, on screen on or
    paper? Well, of course these will change when you scale up, but that has nothing
    to do with design units.\r\n\r\nBy way of <em>grande finale</em>, an answer to
    your question: you can scale a font size up and down until you go blue in the
    face, but its bounding box in design units will always stay the same."
