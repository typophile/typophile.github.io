body: "Hi Guys,\r\nI need help with this one! I am working on a logo for a clothing
  brand based in London. They are aiming at the very highest level of the streat/casual
  market, and selling worldwide. So the logo must work internationally. I have gone
  for an image to represent the pagan greenman god. The brand wanted, a folk/pagan
  feel but with a mix of traditional/modern style. It needs to be instatly recognisable
  and distinctive, and memorable.\r\n\r\nIt will be used for prited catalogue, on
  garments, labels, stickers and web. It is still in development so colours can change.\r\n\r\nwhats
  your thoughts?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/merlin.jpg]"

    type may want to be tracked out a bit; tightly-spaced caps carry less of an association
    with \"elegance\" and are sometimes hard to read.\r\n\r\nI am very, very glad
    to see there are still people who when asked to create a folk/pagan feel do not
    go straight to uncial lettering!"

    will need to go more in the direction of acanthus leaves for the green man like
    <a href=\"http://www.stonecarver.com/arrabbiato.html\">this</a> rather than combine
    the horned god and the green man into one character.\r\nTim"

    head for a trophy (although that's about right).

    Only thing I'd like to see on it is a flourish on the M, that ties it in to the
    main image - so the text could stand alone and still have a pagan feel to it?
    But I don't know anything so probably best to ignore me :)\r\n\r\nP"

    the logo I do not want it to be seen as a Che Guevara rip, so will need to change
    it, would like it simplified also.  Wat are peoples thougths on a direction to
    go in?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/merlin-type.jpg]"

  body: "The type is killing the potential. I love the direction of the horned man.
    But, scratch the type. With some illustrated like that you need to keep the type
    simple and the illustration separate from it. Fashion needs no explanation. Especially
    if this is going towards the level of high end Covent Garden or Notting Hill or
    wherever else is on point now. \r\n\r\nThe two last versions you have posted ...
    the idea of the antlers and the M is interesting, but the typefaces you've chosen
    are too well known in other areas. I'd really keep the logo separate from the
    logotype. "

    one of the replies said about including the type, so was just trying out. Regarding
    final type that will be used, I am looking for something more interesting at the
    moment. \r\n\r\nI had the same thought myself hat logo and type together are killing
    it. The one with out is the direction Im going in. But my minds blank now, and
    I need some ideas or comments, on what is working and what is not. Im going back
    to drawing board now to play with some ideas and will post soon. thanks. \r\n\r\nPS:
    your assumption on brand was correct, is selling in Covent garden, Liberty, and
    somewhere in Notting Hill, along side labels such as Silas, PAM, Supreme, Bathing
    ape, Stussy etc. But the label is alot cleaner and less graphics based, so logo
    needs to reflect this. "

    the images are going to Peter Saville Associates, for packaging design, and label
    design. I think they will develop final logo type, and overall typeface for packaging.
    But it would be interesting to show them the antler type for reference, it may
    work but only separate to main logo.  \r\n\r\nWhat type font do you think might
    work? Do you think it should be sans? \r\n\r\n"

    has a lovely M (the rest is tasty too).\r\nWhat I was saying about the Che look
    was not to imply a ripoff just a first impression on seeing it, but I do think
    that it is too nebulous to be read as a pagan image.\r\nTim"

    though. The client wants a logo type that is cleaner, with less character to its
    self, hence I am allowed to be more creative with the logo.\r\n\r\nI need a serif
    font that is well balanced in height and width, as the name 'Merlin is six letters
    I do not want it to appear to wide. \r\n\r\nI am going to work on the logo tonight
    and will post something new tomorrow. Any thoughts tonight I can take away with
    me are greatly appreciated. "

  body: "Thanks Tim, \r\n\r\nThe logo does not need to be known to have a pagan reference,
    thats just my brief. They want the logo to be able to stand on its own, with out
    being kitch to twee, with no real link to anything, apart from maybe a noble old
    folk feel, slightly.  \r\n\r\nIm worried about the bottom appearing like a shield,
    it not supposed to look like something mounted on the wall. "

    work with clothing. Its form vs function. I agree separating the mark from the
    name might be the safest way to go.

    but I do not think it looks forced or intentional, what do others think. I never
    had this is mind when doing this one. Please can I have some feed back from others
    on this matter? I think the Bape logo is far more like a silhouette, where as
    the Merlin logo is far more stylized in design. This is why I have tried to make
    is as symmetrically proportionate as possible. But maybe its not working?  \r\n\r\nBut
    on the matter of the concept being similar, this I have no idea what you mean.
    Bathing Ape brands everything, whereas this brand is very much about simplicity,
    actually  its concept is so completely the opposite of Bathing Ape.  Please explain
    how you see the two concepts in a similar way?  "

  body: I see your point now, for the similarities in the logo are noticeable. As
    both brands operate on same level, this will need to be considered. I am working
    on a new icon, please allow we the weekend to pull together a number of new designs
    which I shall post. Thank you for your very useful thoughts
