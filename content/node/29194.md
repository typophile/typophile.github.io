  body: "See the FLS5 Manual, p.241:\r\n<cite>Underline [Position]: This is the position
    of the middle of the underline line in your font\r\nThickness: This is the thickness
    of the underline line.</cite>\r\n[They go into the post and CFF table of an OT
    font.]\r\n\r\nAs to Strikeout Position and Thickness, these don't seem to be mentioned
    in the manual, but obviously it's the same for them.\r\n[These go into OS/2 table
    of an OT font.]\r\n\r\nI'd make Underline as thick as the 'underscore' glyph,
    and Strikeout as thick as 'endash'/'emdash', and position them according to these
    two reference glyphs. However, I am not aware of applications that actually use
    these values. Has anybody made some tests?\r\n\r\nKarsten"
