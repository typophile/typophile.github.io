body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post. Been lurking around these parts for
  a while, figured this would be the best place to get thoughtful, constructive feedback
  from some really bright people. Anywho, I'm working on branding a tax and payroll
  service, starting, naturally, with the logo. I'm meeting the client in about two
  and a half hours, so I thought I'd post something real quick to get some last minute
  opinions!"

  body: "i'm not fan of the color choice, What does mean the logo, is that building.
    I find the typo quite cool, i just see a tiny tiny problem\r\nwith the final n
    mergin with t. The bottom curve (outside curve) of the n is horizontally too long
    (a millimeter or two), almost nothing."

    to the columns on a bar graph. '

  body: The mark took me a while to pin down. Not sure if abstract buildings say Payroll.
    The LI and AN combo feel tense, claustrophobic almost.

  body: "Type looks quite wobbly...\r\nAnd those three buildings are maybe a bit non
    readable with complete white walls. Maybe instead of having 100% white walls you
    could colour them in some very light blue colour.\r\n\r\nOr change the symbol
    because all they say is probably: corporate, big firms, financial, low trust.
    Just my opinion.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
