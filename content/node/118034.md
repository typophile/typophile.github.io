    has an ampersand that bows like this one, but the whole font isn't delicate enough
    to match the sample.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kthomps5 and Dpape. Thank you both for the reply! \r\n\r\nYes the Hubert
    Jocham Double U Serif  looks to be a match. \r\n\r\nAlthough the \"e\" doesn't
    seem to slant up and the dot of the \"i\" looks higher up. Those details may be
    custom to the headline. I'm calling it mystery solved.\r\n\r\nMany thanks again.
    I love the Typophile folks. \r\n\r\nJC"
