    not easy keeping those yaks afloat.\r\n\r\nChrisL: Great new avatar, I like it.
    Kind of reminds me of a cross between <a href=\"http://www.duke.edu/~cfs5/\" target=\"new\">Dizzy
    Gillespie</a> and <a href=\"http://www.howdydoodytime.com/cast_phineas.htm\" target=\"new\">Phineas
    T. Bluster</a>. Actually, I bet you're very cool... like Dizzy! I'm more like
    Phineas, myself.\r\n\r\nI didn't realize the number of my posts were that high
    as I generally launch the \"Recent Posts\" page which doesn't show a count.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, so let's not <a href=\"http://www.howdydoodytime.com/cast_dilly.htm\">Dilly
    Dally</a>!"

    Jazz era, Pouches, Miles, Trane, Monk, Silver--Maybe it was just that I was young
    enough to stay awake for the last set in those days. Now I stay home and listen
    to Puccini, Verdi, and Mozart operas.\r\n\r\nMy Howdy Doody memory sees me more
    as a Thunderthud than a Bluster. \r\n\r\nWelcome back Norbert, good to have company
    on the senior citizen bench here at Typophile :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
