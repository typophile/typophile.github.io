  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A friend of mine, one of a three-piece electronic music group (influences seem to range from dubstep to up-beat pop&hellip; that ilk) asked me to have a go at a logo.</p>
<p>He specified letterforms that were of a simpler geometry and added that he wanted it to appeal to male listeners from 16 years old to possibly early 30s.</p>
<p>I wanted to create something reasonably dynamic, given the nature of the music, and try to evoke a sense of movement, which lead me to this current design. It contains a very subtle nod back to the once-emerging dance scene, here in Manchester (maybe not even just this city), but without overtly clinging on to the sentiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reasonably pleased with it so far - a rarity for me - but no doubt there are elements I&rsquo;ve overlooked and not considered.</p>
<p>Any thoughts are gratefully received.</p>

<p>Fair point - I wrote that in haste - it&rsquo;s certainly more an attempt at dynamism than movement.</p>
<p>As for its intended use, I think initially it&rsquo;ll be for digital promotion. Then, as soon as they begin to tour (they&rsquo;ve recently been booked to support a major artist for his UK dates) it will move to print.</p>
<p>It did cross my mind that the diagonals may not suit smaller sizes, but probably not significantly enough until you pointed it out. I&rsquo;m not averse to thickening them a touch to suit, or entrusting them with two (or more) versions.</p>

<p>I think I know what you&rsquo;re saying about those particular sets of &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; - they&rsquo;re not ideal - I just wanted to get a sense of whether you guys felt it worked as an idea. There will certainly be composition revisions.</p>
<p>But about the spacing; I wasn&rsquo;t completely sure how to approach this.
The design was built on a grid, with the strokes being 1 unit wide and, when unaltered, each glyph is roughly 1 unit apart, as below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/citizen_spacing_5526.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s not perfect I think it&rsquo;s reasonably close in this way. But obviously as cuts are made the spacing increases in areas - most notably between the Z and E. I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether people&rsquo;s eyes would automatically fill-in the missing areas and mentally construct an image roughly as shown, or whether I should treat each shape as new and then space it accordingly - possibly risking letters virtually &lsquo;bumping&rsquo; into one another. I do trust your opinion on this, but I&rsquo;d like to know if others felt the same way, as though there were too much space in areas, rather than imagining extended letters, spaced as illustrated.</p>
<p>I tried a 45° diagonal on the N, but wasn&rsquo;t sure if it would make that letter too wide, I may well retry it.</p>

<p>I think the spacing issue is on the way to being rectified, although if anyone has any further input regarding this, I&rsquo;d be happy to hear.</p>
<p>However, a 45° diagonal within the N just doesn&rsquo;t seem to sit well.</p>
