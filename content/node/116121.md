    [[http://scripts.sil.org/scheherazade|Scheherazade]] implements a number cvXX
    features. \r\n\r\nAs for choosing a particular ssXX or cvXX to use, just remember
    that once users begin to use your fonts with character variant or stylistic set
    features, you can't change the your mind about which feature to use without breaking
    user's documents. "

    names to its <code>cv__</code> features. It\u2019s also possible for <code>ss__</code>,

    into a virtual styleset only worked in an older draft I think.\r\nThis font activates
    them by language, but they should probably also be available as ss01\u2013ss04.\r\n<pre><code>

    uses the FeatureParams field of the cv__ features to provide descriptive names.
    This facility was part of the original cv__ feature definition.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It\u2019s
    also possible for ss__, </blockquote>\r\n\r\nas of OT 1.6, yes.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Does
    any font editor and GUI DTP software support named features?\r\nDo many fonts
    contain names?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI think we've had a chicken-and-egg problem:
    Font developers are waiting for apps to support these UI strings, and app developers
    are waiting for fonts to contain them. That is one reason SIL has started including
    them.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I believe font vendors should soon start to include CSS
    files with fonts that are intended to be used on the Web as part of the documentation.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    had that same thought when I read your original post. Thanks for providing an
    example -- hopefully you won't mind if SIL uses it (or something derived from
    it) in future releases?"
