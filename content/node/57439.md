  can be broken into three threads, in different colors, and it still maintains its
  flow, and the three threads are cohesive. And who says that scripture is not divinely
  inspired. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blue_5477.png]\r\n\r\nMichael"

    double-storey <em>a</em>s used in a single word without even realizing that something
    unusual was going on. I only noticed after looking closely and specifically for
    alts, so natural the mixing of alts is in this work. I wish all the snowflakes
    were unique, though.
