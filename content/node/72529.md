  to pair Gill New Antique (not my choice) with a Script face for large text (really
  big headlines, tpe on the walls and stuff). For print we'll be using Joanna or Perpetua
  (still trying to decide) with Gill New Antique, but I think it'd be a nice touch
  to have a script face for BIG type. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
