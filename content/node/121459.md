  I was wondering if any of you had a similar problem. The curves look all nice and
  smooth when i drew them. I first drew them in Illustrator and then import them in
  Fontographer where they also look nice. They don't look so nice after I generate
  the font and I zoom in, the fine details I mean.\r\n\r\nThank you"

    how it looks like after generating it as Open Type TT/True Type in Fontographer
    and the third one is after generating it FontLab Studio 5. Does any of you know
    why they look this way?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5737.jpg]"

    have you printed them out?

    TrueType quadratic splines. Always look at Bezier curves, not at filled shapes. '

  body: Yes, it is the conversion from Illustrator cubic splines to TrueType quadratic
    splines. I did not know that yesterday but I did more reading today. Thank you!
