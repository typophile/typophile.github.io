  body: 'The color combo and layout seems awfully familiar. IIRC there&#39;s a similar
    logo in use by some IT or management consulting outfit but I can&#39;t for the
    life of me remember which...not terribly helpful, I suppose, but maybe something
    to research if you haven&#39;t. Or not. <BR> <BR>On a more substantive note, I
    agree with Eduardo regarding Cocon, though I also like Dutch 809, modulo the ampersand
    which isn&#39;t among my favorites. <BR> <BR>The symbol has been approved, so
    I probably should keep my mouth shut. Discretion, however, is not one of my virtues.
    So, what is it? How does it relate to coaching?  <BR> <BR>&#40;aside: am I the
    only one whose skin crawls upon reading/hearing that word? too much time on Ryze
    and eCademy amongst the throngs of &#39;life coaches&#39;, perhaps&#41; <BR> <BR>Back
    to substance, I&#39;m not feeling any real relationship between it and the type
    in any of the  mooted solutions. Perhaps it should be closer to the type? The
    two elements just seem to me to &#39;float&#39; in space. I&#39;d try mucking
    with both larger and smaller text and see what that does. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Hey. <BR> <BR>The Cocon definitely gives a more informal feel, it&#39;s warmer.
    But is it just me, or does it feel like it&#39;s leaning to the left? I think
    the logo is pulling it some, and combined with the terminals... <BR> <BR>Is it
    heresy to suggest putting a few degrees of right lean into it to optically straighten
    it? <BR> <BR>I do like the logo. It looks like 4 people in very nice chairs gathered
    around a very small table, or maybe a big group hug. <BR> <BR>David Roughs <BR>

  body: Cocon rules. <BR> <BR>Bloemsma has in fact been fighting the backwards lean
    in his design style for a while - and with Avance has found one solution. But
    a few degrees is too much, try half or one degree. Syntax for example leans forward
    by half a degree, while Seria&#39;s &#34;upright italic&#34; leans by [an average
    of] one. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s unless you want to make the lean visible. In that
    case I&#39;ve found that about 3 degress is the comfortable minimum &#40;at normal
    reading sizes&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    might look fun if they were joined? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: I find the symbol with cocon makes a kind of teddybear/toy feel and given
    the approval of the symbol and the colour Avenir seems a better choice.
