body: I had such a wonderful response the last time I posted, I decided to try a job-related
  post this time!  <BR> <BR>I need help IDing the font&#40;s&#41; used in <a href="http://www.fadingtoblack.com/gaylaprom/home.jpg">This
  logo</a>. I&#39;ve been doing advertisments for them for about 4 months and they
  don&#39;t even know the font used, and I&#39;ve been using a scanned letter head
  and because I&#39;m new to type ID, I know I&#39;ll just skrew it up if I try to
  ID it alone...  <BR> <BR>Oh! And I have all but 10 fonts ID&#39;d &#40;from my last
  thread&#41; Thanks for the Estee Lauder reference and link, I raided my moms makeup
  counter and found some of my fonts!  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance~Mikey <BR>
