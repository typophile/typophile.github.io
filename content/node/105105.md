  body: You are right - I did not look closely at the g - It is actually Normande

  body: Other variants on the theme then are Falstaff MT (Monotype) and Norton DB
    (a Softmaker clone of something else). Bodoni TS-Heavy from Typeshop and Bodoni
    Poster from Adobe. All similar but each a bit different. The gap in the middle
    of the g seems to be smaller in the sample but I can not find one that looks just
    like it.
