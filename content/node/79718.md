    this weakens?\r\nWhat does Social Media means \u2013 that you have an facebook
    account or twitter \u2026?\r\nWhat does design means: Your an engineer, your a
    graphic designer, your a product designer, an architect etc.? I know that I am
    provoking \u2026\r\n\r\nFirst of all i would start with \"how to describe what
    i do in a concise way\". After that you can think about the visualisation.\r\n "

  body: I like that it reminds me of a pilcrow.

- body: "I don't understand how any of \"poms\" questions are relevant, but I do suspect
    there's a language barrier involved? I don't think anyone would be so obtuse as
    to think that \"social media\" means you <em>participate</em> in social media.
    Obviously, you build/design/manage social media. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I think the mark
    and the logotype are nice. I might work on the kerning of \"SOC\" a bit, but otherwise
    I think it's pretty sharp just the way it is. "

  body: "Thanks guys!  Helpful stuff.  A pilcrow was another inspiration of mine,
    of course.\r\n\r\nThe mark with \"Social Media & Design\" is mostly just to display
    it in another context, it's not totally final."

  body: The mark itself is quite nice. You might try the 'Social Media & Design' bit
    in a different face (or even just small caps) to give a little more contrast between
    it and your name.

  body: "I agree that the presence of \"social media\" in the logo looks a bit like
    all those required keywords people stuff into the resume so that it would pass
    through HR filters. It basically does not say anything at all, what you do in
    the domain of social media is completely unclear.\r\n\r\nThe mark is nice. I would
    probably want to see the type a bit smaller and heavier, and moved slightly to
    the right to even out perceived padding on the sides."

  body: Yep, the mark is good. I would place more dominance of the icon, and make
    the logotype secondary, in the background even. You may achieve this through size,
    or rather just less 'design'.

  body: Thanks guys for all your input!  I'm going to try to put up another version
    with apankrat's advice, making the type a bit smaller and heavier.  Like I said,
    the second logo is just a test - nothing final or anything.
