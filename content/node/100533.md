body: "I was looking at the Wikipedia entry on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_%28typeface%29\">Bell</a>
  and some of what it says seems a bit weird.  First of all, it describes it as \"the
  first Scotch Roman face\".  Does that seem right?  I thought Scotch Roman specifically
  referred to descendents of Miller's mid-nineteenth-century Pica Roman No. 2 and
  close facsimiles.  Bell is a late-eighteenth-century transitional with many features
  in common with Scotch, but I wouldn't personally classify it as one. \r\n\r\nI know
  Richard Austin is often credited with designing the Miller face (although as far
  as I can tell this is entirely based on T.C Hansard, who made the claim with little
  or no substantiation).  I wonder if whoever wrote this part of the Wikipedia article
  was confusing this latter type with Austin's much earlier Bell type.\r\n\r\n(It
  also lists one of Bell's characteristics as \"square dot over the letter i\"...
  ???)\r\n\r\nThat brings me to the article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_Roman\">Scotch
  Roman</a> itself.  Um.  It actually barely says anything (a travesty on its own),
  and what it does say seems quite inaccurate:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>These typefaces
  were modeled on an original 1839 design by Samuel Nelson Dickinson, founder of the
  Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston, who had the design cut by Richard Austin, and
  cast by Alexander Wilson and Son in Glasgow, Scotland.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe quoted
  sentence cites <a href=\"http://typefoundry.blogspot.ca/2007/02/scotch-roman.html\">this
  Typefoundry article</a> as a source.  Yet a careful reading of the latter actually
  contradicts it almost entirely:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The 1939 Dickinson design, which
  is nowhere said to have been cut by Austin, is only the origin of the \"Scotch face\"
  name, but is <em>not</em> the model for the Scotch Roman typefaces themselves.\r\n<li>The
  actual model, Miller Pica Roman No.2, is the one claimed by Hansard to have been
  cut by Austin, but the article specifically casts doubt on that claim.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI
  get the distinct impression that the Wikipedia article author just hastily skimmed
  the source article without properly understanding what it said.\r\n\r\nI'm hardly
  an expert on these matters, so I'm reluctant to simply start editing the Wikipedia
  articles myself... not at least without getting some informed opinions.  Can anyone
  comment?"

    on a nineteenth-century design from the Edinburgh foundry of William Miller: his
    \"Pica Roman No. 2\".  Some accounts suggest that Miller's type, the oldest surviving
    specimen of which dates to 1813, was cut by Richard Austin.  \r\n\r\nThe name
    \"Scotch Roman\", which entered use in the United States late in the same century,
    was applied to a slightly modified recasting of Miller's type by the A.D. Farmer
    foundry of New York.  It is believed to derive from \"Scotch-face\", a term which
    was originally used by a different type designed in 1839 by typefounder Samuel
    Nelson Dickinson of Boston, and cast for him by Alexander Wilson and Son in Glasgow.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAll

  body: "@altsan... great that you are taking this one on... I am curious, though,
    about the following:\r\n\r\n1. Even though the term \"Scotch Roman\" generally
    refers back to Farmer/Wilson's \"Scotch-face\", we novices tend, and perhaps the
    evolution(s) of Scotch Roman seems to flow more from the Miller designs than the
    Farmer/Wilson designs. Is this a fair observation?\r\n\r\n2. Even the Miller designs
    are fluid. His earlier designs maintains the chiseled lowercase \"t\"... where
    his later designs (and most Scotch Romans since) adopted the flattop \"t\" (using
    just one example).\r\n\r\n3. Simply from a historical sense, I get the feeling
    that Scotch Romans were truly a \"transitional\" typeface... attempting to blend
    the artistry and readability of the Baskervilles/Bells, etc., with leanings toward
    the \"business-mercantilism\" feel that America was experiencing in the late 18th
    and early 19th centuries. \"Scotch-face\" seems a bit more business-like than
    Pica No. 2 ?\r\n\r\n4. The revivals of the Scotch Romans seem to take a multitude
    of paths emanating from both Wilson and Miller's visions... besides Carter's Miller,
    Escrow, Whittingham, FF Clifford (?), Georgia, Nick's Scotch Modern (which leans
    a bit toward the didones ?... sorry Nick if I misstate this)... what others fit
    into this genre, and from what are their designs derived. I've always been confused
    how to \"mentally\" interpret a specific typeface design when the inspirations
    are multiple and diverse. \r\n\r\nWasn't sure whether any of this was relevant
    to your possible editing of the wiki entry..."

    caught on. Perhaps it\u2019s not a good idea, or perhaps I haven\u2019t promoted
    it well enough. Or perhaps people think it\u2019s just a marketing gimmick.\r\n\r\nTherefore

    Scotch Modern, even though transitionals are considered, chronologically, to be
    Baskervillian, leading from Garalde to Didone.\r\n\r\nTwo meanings for Transitional,
    whether Phylogentic (evolutionary/historical) or Taxonomic (physical features).\r\n\r\nAccordingly,
    a 20th century transitional such as Dwiggins\u2019 Caledonia (with its clever
    \u201CScottish\u201D name), not being a revival or pointedly weighted to either
    the Baskervillian or ScoMo historical era, might be considered post-modern."

    it has those horizontal almost-unbracketed serifs (which indeed distinguish it
    from something like Bell, to refer back to my earlier remark).  You're quite right
    about the gentler transition, though.  "
