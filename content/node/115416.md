body: I want to say this used to be a Formatt, Chartpak or Letraset font and if memory
  serves the D had a dot in the middle of it. I have looked through the catalogs I
  had but think this font came out just before they quit printing them. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/koala

  body: "I found a font named <strong>Snootchie Bootchies</strong> which looks like
    a good match - only /T is a bit different.\r\nThe copyright says \"Rev. Josh Wilhelm
    2000\" but I don't have any other info and I can't find any legitimate source
    to acquire it."

    is Letraset 1985. A quick glance through it did not show a match.\r\nDon"

  body: WOW! Thank You very much. I did some searching and downloaded it from what-font.co.uk.
    I do remember that T being "not wanted" and "fixed" as per the boss but I do not
    remember that name. It certainly would have stood out just like "Belching up Salisbury
    Steak" which I used to sneak in art files as live text just so some artist or
    out-putter would have to call me and ask for the font. As it turns out in my searching
    I came across Jsh Wilhelm and an association with "Spork Thug Typography" on 1001freefonts.com
    along with a few others. He apparently is very creative with his names and guess
    what? He is responsible for Belching up salisbury steak! crazy!!!! Thank You very
    Much!!!
