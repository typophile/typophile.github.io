  for the answer to this before I posed it, but I still feel clueless, so I was hoping
  the great Typophile Hive Mind might have a good idea :)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a
  good font for my PhD thesis document in Computer Science. My university gives me
  significant leeway in how I format the document.\r\n\r\nI've been using the Classic
  Thesis template for LaTeX, which has an [[http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/classicthesis/ClassicThesis.pdf|example
  pdf]], and that's typeset in Palatino. The author also suggests Minion Pro would
  be a good substitution.\r\n\r\nI am not adverse to Palatino particuarly, but something
  feels not quite <i>right</i> about it, and I can't put my finger on it. The thesis
  needs to look great on screen and in print (perhaps more so on screen, as I expect
  that's how most people will read it), and Palatino seems to do that.\r\n\r\nI can't
  decide if I feel like it's a bit straight-laced for a CS document, maybe it's a
  bit too elegant and needs something \"cleaner\" (would humanist be a good description?)\r\n\r\nApologies
  in advance for my general typographic newbieness. I know what I like when I see
  it, I'm just not at the critical level to communicate why yet. Like I am with wine
  :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "<em>does hinting effect fonts displayed in a PDF document?</em>\r\n\r\nYes.
    Acrobat uses Adobe's CoolType renderer, rather than system rasterisers, so what
    you get in PDF is outlines and hints as interpreted by CoolType, which will differ
    from how the same fonts are rendered by the OS in other applications."

  body: "Hi John,\r\nThank you for your Cambria suggestion. I think I prefer it, but
    it feels a little tall and thin, like all the letters are standing upright to
    attention! It makes me feel a little tense! I'm looking for something that feels
    more relaxing. Palatino makes me feel like I'm reading a tome rather than a modern
    (yet intellectual) piece.\r\n\r\nAre there any fonts along similar lines? I had
    a look at FF Scala, but then my wallet hurt :)\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so
    far!"

  body: "Constantia was going to be my second suggestion. Cambria works better as
    a screen font, although both typefaces were designed to look good with Microsoft's
    ClearType rendering system, but Constantia is a warmer text face and sets very
    well for print.\r\n\r\nNote that if you are going to be setting math equations,
    the Cambria family includes Cambria Math, which is built to work with the new
    math handler in Word 2007. So this is another reason why you might consider Cambria."

    Wonderful!\r\n\r\nI use LaTeX to typeset (with XeTeX so I have access to the fonts
    on my Mac), and right now the template uses Palatino to typeset math. I am expecting
    this will look somewhat compatible, but I am sure I can find a complementary font
    to Constantia that will work.\r\n\r\nI'm not a maths guy, so I prefer my text
    to look perfect than my math, so I'll definitely make it work.\r\n\r\nThank you
    both once again, I'm very pleased with the results."

  body: "You mention LaTeX, so I'll throw out either Minion or Utopia as possibilities.
    Both have good LaTeX math support, and Utopia seems well-suited for on-screen
    reading. I don't know that either recommendation is particularly tied to CS, but
    I have used both for mathematical writing. I have a soft spot in my heart for
    Charter as well, and it also displays well on-screen.  Charter doesn't seem elegant
    to me, and perhaps it's not suited to a dissertation that wants a more formal
    feel, but I do like the clean and open feeling it has.  Perhaps it would mix well
    with code snippets, etc.\r\n\r\nst"

    big reveal at the end :)\r\n\r\nThanks Scott!"

    aspect of this you're talking about. If you're referring to Quartz retaining hints
    at small sizes, that doesn't contradict what I wrote, which is that Quartz is
    the only renderer I am aware of that deliberately ignores all hints, even if it
    only does so at most sizes. Sure, I could have been more precise, but I was answering
    Frode's question.

  body: "So \u2014 basically \u2014 if your typeface is going to be viewed on screen,
    your best bet is a typeface that is hinted to preform well on screens with low
    resolution. Have a look at the [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/n/web_fontfonts/|Web
    Fontfonts]]. They have a number of good serifs, amongs them Celeste might be the
    most bookish. Cambria and Constantia are also hinted for the screen. Monotype
    also have a section of fonts (although quite a few of them are very spindly) classified
    under the label [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/searchresults.htm?st=4&cid=ESQ%C2%AE%20%28Enhanced%20Screen%20Quality%29|Enchanced
    Screen Quality]], amongst them Sabon and Plantin \u2013 the latter might be too
    magazine-ish for what you want."

  body: It is possible to use a math font based on Minion or Utopia and then use another
    font for text; for instance, one can call the MinionPro package with the onlymath
    option so as to get all the necessary symbol characters and the Minion letters
    for the formulas, and then use Arno for text. I tried that and the result was
    quite nice till I got some indexed variable  immediately followed by an Arno comma
    that, at least on the screen, almost seemed to clash with the lower index. When
    there is some computer stuff, there is often also the need for a non proportional
    font that fits. Finding the right mix is not always easy and depends a lot on
    the text. For me, when in doubt,  use... Utopia for body text, but I like using
    other fonts with XeLaTeX when nothing clashes.

    and [[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59692/constantia.pdf|Constantia]]. \r\n\r\nI think
    Constantia works better zoomed further out, and Utopia better further in. I also
    think Constantia looks slightly better printed.\r\n\r\nI think you can flip a
    coin, safe in the knowledge wherever it lands, it'll look great.\r\n\r\nI may
    go for Utopia because it's more portable and easy to put into LaTeX (doesn't have
    the XeTeX dependency).\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!"

    go with either a better imitation of a classic typewriter face, or with Courier,

    and see which one looks nicest. I use Consolas for my editing, but that's really

    Linotype call XSF). Aldus (for text) is to my eyes the better Palatino, and Aldus
    nova is its definitive digital incarnation. If you use Aldus you could use Palatino
    as an auxiliary font for the math work and for the display sizes.\r\n\r\nI think
    that both Palatino and Aldus work <em>very</em> well for CS work. I have read
    a lot of published and unpublished CS related work set in various forms of Palatino,
