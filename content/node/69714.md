body: I'll start by saying yes, I use Windows....AND my hard drive crashed about a
  month ago.  A logo I created for a co-worker is now gone in it's eps format, and
  so are a lot of the fonts I used to have.  I have used the whatthefont.com application
  and it comes back as Bank Gothic, but if you look at the top of the S in the logo,
  the Bank Gothic has a "spur" that my font does not have.  I am only interested in
  the top SOS part of the logo.  I appreciate any help anyone can give me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo

  body: Paulstonier, Thank you SO much for your help.  I'm pretty sure that it wasn't
    Changeling, I don't remember anything close to that name.  But, based on the category
    "square sans serif" and the site myfonts.com, I think I found it.  Or at least
    it's close enough that I can't tell the difference, which means my co-worker won't
    either.  It is Chromium Yellow by Nick's Fonts.  When I typed over the jpeg file
    in Illustrator it fits perfectly.  Thanks again!
