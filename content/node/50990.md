  body: "Horrible.\r\n\r\nSorry, I couldn't resist... That is possibly the UGLIEST
    font/logo I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. Yeech! Inconsistent weights,
    upper & lower case mix, bad curves, etc. etc.... why would you even want to know
    the font?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a GOOd font with some of the same \"feel\", you might
    try DIN or Dax from http://www.fontfont.com."

  body: I know that it's really ugly. I have to redraw this small bitmap. It will
    be easier if I know what font is used. Dax is near. Thank you Scott!
