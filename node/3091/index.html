		<div class="commentbody">Matthew, this is really nothing short of amazing. Looking at some individual glyphs one might be tempted to dismiss it as just another constructed font, but I first saw the texture of the setting, and it immediately hit me: this is the true Egyptian style! :-&gt; One the other hand, your heavily ligated* settings look a lot like the Indian Devanagari script! Really huge potential there, in terms of a display face to accompany Indian text, or just Latinate text about Indian stuff. You've really shifted the nature of the Latin alphabet, but with practical subtlety - bravo. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I'd concentrate very heavily on this; and do look at Process's linguistically-aware (sorry, John - &quot;orthographic&quot; means something else to me) Lingua design -and its development- when deciding what pairs to provide. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The glyphs that don't work are the &quot;k&quot; and &quot;x&quot;. For the former you need a simpler shape, or you could try the structure with a loop on top and a short arm on the bottom - or maybe an open loop with an arm. For the &quot;x&quot; try making the top a semi-circle and the bottom two distinct arms, like the &quot;H&quot; in PsyOps's inimitable Spanner. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other problematic glyphs are the &quot;t&quot; (not sure what to do about it) and the &quot;w&quot; (I'd make it like two &quot;v&quot;s). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yes, do make heavier weights (with no stroke modulation). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This font also has potential for much more decorative treatments, like nipples* at the bottom of the bowls. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I squarely blame Tanya for starting me off on that foot today. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">What do you mean by cheat? It seems clear that there are some rules you are applying in order to create the look &amp; distict structure you have - you mean deviation from those no? But think of regular roman characters. They follow rules too &amp; yet even there you have characters with distinct personalities - the M is really wide etc so - it seems like you could have judicious exceptions in several places &amp; end up with a face with increased interest &amp; readability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Did you cheat with the open LC k? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course you are right that in general it is silly to try to make a face that is both solid in text &amp; display but I think you have a shot.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am thinking of J Hoefler's Didot where display was accounted for in the details at large sizes rather than in the basic appraoch. Those faces can be really nice in display. It's not a completely parrallel example - especially since some folks hate it when a didone font is set in book texts - but the basic idea being that display quality &amp; text quality could be addressed in seperate cuts of the same family with happy results. That is a really classic approach after all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think my nordic heritage may be coming into play subconsciously. ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I put the serif on the display &quot;l&quot; because I didn't like it on the text version and it makes the display version just that little bit more different.
