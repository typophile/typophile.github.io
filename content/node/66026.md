  bold logo. It's for a small marketing services agency. They're innovative, modern,
  fun and young.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/soho_gothic_pro_bold/\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone suggest a sans serif font that would pair well with it when used for text?
  I found that for large bodies of text, Soho Gothic is not the most readable font.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help!"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions Stephen! Can you recommend a sans serif that would
    contrast a bit more with Soho Gothic? Also do you know any serifs that would work
    well with Soho Gothic?

    side since Soho Gothic is pretty rigid and techy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process_type_foundry/seravek_pack/\">Seravek</a>\r\n<a

    sits next to Soho Gothic?"

    I am looking for something that will work with a the Soho Gothic logo (and heads)
    and either Seravek or Gloriola.\r\n\r\nAlso, Seravek are Gloriola good for web
    display?\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help so far!"
