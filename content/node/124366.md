  sir or ma'am:\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I am humbled by the many creative
  and graphical artists on the Typophile forum. I am seeking your expertise on kerning
  advice on the font in the embedded logo for my personal photography project. The
  colors are inspired from the actual flag of India. I found the Pantone colors that
  appears on the actual Indian flag.\r\n\r\nThe colors on the Indian flag are (top
  to bottom): Saffron, White (Cool Grey), Navy Blue, and India Green. I started with
  Saffron and alternated the sequence to color the individual letters in \"MR. BOLLYWOOD.\"
  My question pertains to kerning. The actual Hindi Devanagari look like this: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/sam_5083.png].
  It's taken from the Linotype website. The font I used in \"MR. BOLLYWOOD\" is Sansara
  from the Linotype foundry. You can see that the actual Devanagari script appear
  interconnected. That's what I tried with the first four words \"MR.\" and \"BO.\"\r\n\r\nDo
  you think it's a better design-wise, if I continue the pattern with the remaining
  letters?\r\n\r\nIf you would like to download the .AI (CS6) and play, you're more
  than welcomed to. I uploaded to my guest directory: [[http://guest.ronaldnztan.com/MrBollywood-LOGO-Light.zip]].
  It's changed into outlines via the \"Create Outlines\" command.\r\n\r\nI look forward
  to hearing back from you. I appreciate the help and suggestions on improvement.\r\n\r\nRon"
