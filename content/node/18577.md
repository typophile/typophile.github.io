  stock art or (better yet) an artist that can draw fairly lifelike human anatomy
  illustrations (vector format please). Any takers or suggestions? Please post links
  to your portfolio so we can review. Feel free to post any questions here, I'll do
  my best to answer them.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for muscle illustrations with a semi-transparent
  skin layer.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated\r\n\r\nBeau"

  body: Beau, I think you are barking up the wrong tree. This forum is about fonts,
    type, typography, lettering and so on, with a little bit of graphic design thrown
    in. You will not likely find discussions or advice about illustration, stock art
    or anatomical drawings here. Sorry.

    the term within quotes, and you should find a number of qualified individuals.

    _\r\nfrom a bookstore in Rome, and it has served me well.\r\nMany of the illustrations
    are comically archaic, but\r\nmany of them are totally \"serious\". And it comes
    with\r\na CD-ROM of all the images, royalty-free! If you would\r\nlike to buy
    a copy, look for one via bookfinder.com .\r\n\r\n\r\nBut yeah:\r\nWhere's the
    type?\u2122\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
