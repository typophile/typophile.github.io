  is used by these guys very often and has been a font that has proved elusive for
  quite some time.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if someone could let me know
  where to buy it.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    [[http://klim.co.nz|get in touch with Kris Sowersby]].

    they co\xF6perate in some way. They've also used another unreleased typeface of
    his: Karbon. Also Graphik by Christian Schwartz has been used prior to release.
    You're best bet is contacting Kris directly."
