  of web/CD/video work. I am considering moving to Ottawa. Currently I own a small
  design business and would like to continue to have it that way. My real puzzle is,
  how to make the move. I doubt that my current client base will continue to do business
  with us for a long time after the move is announced. I have done some internet research,
  but I can't find a site that is localized enough to get contracts. From one of the
  posts, it seems like even though, it is not strong as Toronto, it seems like there
  is enough design work.\r\n\r\nThanks."
