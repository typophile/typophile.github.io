body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for font used in Cavaillon Rugby Union Club,
  It's kind of \"block\" font that I often find on jerseys but still unable to identify
  it.\r\nI'm also still looking for the font used in Finnish Rugby Union, that kind
  of Castellar with different shape of serifs.\r\nAll images are attached naturally
  ;-)\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n12HAL9000"
