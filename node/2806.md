body: hi, <BR> <BR>addfoto.com will be a photographers gallery &#43; stock photo &#43;
  photography theory &amp; tutorials project. The concept off ADD something made me
  use the universal &#40;&#43;&#41; symbol that will be the visual brand of the site
  &amp; logo. For now, the colors are not final, and I&#39;m quite happy with the
  results. The card is of course not final, just to show the &#40;&#43;&#41; cut I
  want to use on this ID. <BR> <BR>I want a strong ID, very simple and easy recognizable
  &#40;memorable&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24703.gif"

  body: Hrant that would be a good idea, and Charleston Heston would indorse it especially
    if you had a deer image behind the cross hairs.

  body: Would you use the &#43;F as a gestalt?  It may suggest F&#43;, as in failing
    plus.  I like your approach though. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24716.jpg"

  body: Thanks for your comments. I won&#39;t use F&#43; as a gestalt, the &#43;FOTO
    will be always as one. I will use the &#40;&#43;&#41; as the gestalt. <BR> <BR>About
    the bottom corners, you are right, I did this so fast as the idea was good that
    I really need to put the stuff on illustrator. I think Daniel is correct on the
    cross hairs... I have to think anf try a bit more.

  body: I love that logo. Simply I love it. the &#43; may get lost as you pullaway
    though. I dont know how it&#39;ll look on a pen &#40; Micro size &#41; or on other
    color backgrounds. If its pure white it works. ButLittle Gettyimages with a color
    scheme if your going for a new brand. hmmm... play with it in other colors see
    how it works other flat colors.  <BR> <BR>Love the communication though, elegant
    simple brings addition to photography with a corporate functional voice.
