  wallpaper enjoying a game of bridge with a tall, cold \"pink lady\" (a mixture of
  orange and cranberry juice). Picture painted? \r\n\r\nI am trying to find a typeface
  to communicate that you're not throwing in the towel or losing your self-worth when
  entering a retirement community but simplifying your lifestyle and joining a support
  system. Currently, most retirement home identities resemble a combination between
  a funeral home and a suburban subdivision. It should be comforting and inviting
  and maybe even a bit exciting. these are human beings with life in them, not beige
  cookie-cutter ranch houses with 2 door garages. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I am hung
  up on is generational differences. In this tough decision making process, what speaks
  to baby-boomers opposed to generation x? is there a timeless answer?\r\n\r\nJust
  keep in mind that old people can't read. Kidding, I love you granny.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?  "

    sure you don't fall in the pithole of using type in too small a size. Older people
    will want bigger text, online and in print. This doesn't mean 24 point like in
    large-type books, but keep away from the very small type. \r\n\r\nDon't design
    for end of life ... design for ease of life ... retirement is payback for the
    hard work of 40 years. Keep it clean and open, show some quality, but not wanton
    wasteful luxury."

    maybe putting way too much pressure on a typeface to carry that message by itself.\r\n\r\n"

    giving up... If I put myself in the shoes of these folks you mentioned, I suppose
    - it happens to me - people don't want to pick the glasses when playing cards,
    but some would pick up the glasses to read.\r\n\r\nIf you can, make the smaller
    type to 10 pt, the smallest... and use antiques, you know, Windsor or so..."

  body: "I agree with Darrell that you probably are relying on the typography too
    much and neglecting the other aspects of design - we all know that the feel is
    determined by the sum of all elements combined.\r\n\r\nThat beeing said I agree
    with the points on typesize and legibility. I would probably suggest a Scotch
    for its large x heights which in my view results in an easier read (ps: I'm dyslexic).
    One example of a nice Scotch is H&FJ Chronicle.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As an old fart myself, I find it odd that we are suddenly dumped into a catagory
    that erases all former appreciation for typography. I don't think there is such
    a thing as a geezer font. Make a decent layout with good type. Perhaps avoid the
    grunge stuff or anything stressed out but any reputable text face should work.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
