  time to design my own typeface.\r\nWhen I 'Generate Font' fontlab adds nodes to
  all my curves. This causes visible waves in my curves when printed large format
  (tabloid). I have attached two files that I created in Illustrator to demonstrate
  what I mean, one using glyphs from my ttf file, the other contains the glyphs I
  drew myself.\r\nHow can I avoid this, I see this as a major issue.\r\n\r\nThanks

    that usually happens when you convert from PostScript curves (which you probably
    use for drawing in FontLab) to TrueType curves.\r\n\r\nBut when you convert a
    font to outlines in Illustrator, the curves get converted to PostScript again,
    and even more points are added. That means what you see in Illustrator after converting
    isn't what's actually in the font.\r\n\r\nSolution is a) to generate PostScript-based
    OpenType fonts (no curve conversion necessary) or b) convert manually to TrueType
    inside FontLab before generating OT/TrueType fonts. In the latter case you get
    the chance to check the converted curves for bumps and waves (copy the actual
    PS outlines into the mask layer to see the differences) and correct them by hand
    before generating."

  body: "calvintennant, \r\n\r\nevery type design tool will change the contours slightly
    when converting PostScript curves to TrueType curves. It is due to the nature
    of the curves. \r\n\r\nThese curves are based on different geometry. Each PostScript
    node has up to two control points, while in TrueType, there are on-curve points
    and off-curve points: between two nodes there may be often just one off-curve
    \"control point\". It's just a different way to draw curves, and some PostScript
    curves cannot be represented 100% exactly on the same UPM size (i.e. on the same
    grid of units per em). \r\n\r\nThis is somewhat similar to a situation when you
    convert a PNG image to a JPG image, or to a situation when you export a movie
    into a different format, with different compression/encoding. You'll never get
    pixel-for-pixel fidelity. \r\n\r\nIf you want better fidelity in the conversion,
    you could increase the UPM size in Font Info / Metrics and Dimensions before generating
    the .ttf font (you need to enable \"Scale all glyphs...\" there). You can use
    2000 or 3000 UPM rather than 1000. \r\n\r\nI recommend reading the FontLab Studio
    manual for more information about the difference between PostScript and TrueType
    curves. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

    of the curves being correct, is separate from the control points being chosen
    during the lossy conversion from T1 to TT. The best way to avoid this issue is
    to have native drawing of TT in FL. It is the majority product format these days,
    and losslessly converts to T1. When?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

    even TT MM, but it is unconvenient. We are still waiting for meta control points
    to control curvature, tension and distances between TT off-curve points.\r\n\r\ndberlow
    writes:\r\n\"TT losslessly converts to T1\"\r\n\r\nThat is not correct for various
    reasons.\r\n\r\nTT can have a much higher UPM than PS, then you'll have rounding
    to a coarser grid. \r\n\r\nIn theory, between 2 TT off-curve points a PS on-curve
    point can be placed, but this new point must be rounded to the grid, just as any
    new BCP. With all this rounding you lose the quality of your TT curve.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you edit quadratics (TT) in FL, you might notice you can do things that are not
    possible in cubic curves (PS) e.g. an optically pleasing connection between a
    straight and a curve, and this will never convert loslessly.\r\n\r\nBefore converting
    from PS to TT, up scaling the UPM will give a much better curve fidelity. At the
    same time you get more off-curve points per curve segment, and all these off-curve
    points are rounded to the grid, giving a subtle warm wobbliness, that won't be
    there when you go back to PS :-)\r\n\r\nTT curves and fonts *can* be superior
    to PS, it is just too much work."

    don't see how this can be correct. PS curves are cubic equations, of which quadratic
    equations are a special case. So whatever you can do in outlines with quadratic--and
    TT outlines are quadratic--you should be able to do with cubic PS curves, if you
    are on a grid with the same resolution. You may need intermediate points off the
    extrema in PS Beziers, but there is no barrier to adding intermediate points--or
    working in 2048 units per em, right? \r\n"

  body: "\r\n> TT can have a much higher UPM than PS\r\n\r\nHow so? You can make OpenType
    PS (.otf) fonts with a UPM of from 16 to 16,384 units, same for Type 1 -- exactly
    as with TrueType fonts. The maximum coordinates limit in OpenType PS (.otf) fonts
    and Type 1 fonts is \xB14,095, so converting a 16,000 UPM TT font to PS may indeed
    pose a problem. But for the most common cases, there is none. Adobe Arabic is
    an .otf font with PS outlines based on a 2048 UPM, just like most Microsoft-made
    TT fonts. Conversely, many TT fonts are based on a 1000 UPM, just like most Adobe-made
    PS fonts. But both PS and TT fonts can have pretty much any UPM, within the set
    limits. \r\n\r\nSee http://www.typophile.com/node/30913 for more discussion on
    this. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
