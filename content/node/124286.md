body: "Marcel is an angular upright and lightly backslant script typeface inspired
  by the natural shapes obtained when drawing a letter in marker pen or brush. It
  is inspired by the work of French type designer Marcel Jacno. This unique design
  later inspired many other typeface designers like Roger Excoffon with his \u2018Banco\u2019.
  I recommend to use it for any packaging design related to quality and hand-made
  products, advertising, web, posters, magazines and book jackets. Marcel is loaded
  with an extended character set, supporting Central, Western and Eastern European
  languages and plenty of cool OpenType features like brush underlines in different
  styles for each word length. Kerning and spacing (+ than 25,000 kerning pairs) have
  been meticulously made-to-measure to this specific brush font design.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jeremia-adatte/marcel/\r\n\r\n<a
