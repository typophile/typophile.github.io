body: I'm seeking type recommendations for a "high fashion" brand that appeals to
  25+ year old females. Yet at the same time, it shouldn't be overtly feminine, as
  it has to still appeal to males on some level. Any assistance would be much appreciated.

    Series]] by Parachute fonts suitable for your project. For better recommendations
    tell us more about the brand and it's activities. How will you use the fonts?

    and small signage: wayfinding, print, embroidery, digital formats: web and mobile...
    everything."

    is high fashion, yet I don't find it totally feminine.\r\n\r\nOf course, you'd
    have to pair it with something heavier to meet all your needs."

    though. What do you think's wrong with it? If you can undercut Igino's prices
    you're welcome to my next font ;)\r\n\r\n@chrisburton @JamesM Thank you!"

    side of the \"r\" is too loose, the right side of the \"k\" is too tight, the
    \"Y\" is overkerned versus the lc... BUT: It's still a nice font - any good effort
    based on Plantin is highly welcome!\r\n\r\nNow, BMW doesn't try to undercut Vespa's
    prices :-) but maybe we can talk before your next release - you might be pleasantly
    surprised (although the larger your character set the more price difference there
    will be).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
