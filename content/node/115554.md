body: I have been having a hard time ID'ing this typeface. It's the Mobilgas SPECIAL
  logo, that was used before the 80's I believe. Maybe even as early as the 60's.
  Similar to URW Grotesk, but it has more stroke contrast in the lower case o, a,
  and g. Also the counter on the b is a bit odd. Thoughts?
