<p>This is my first post on here, despite being a member for a few months, but I was just wondering if I could get some advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working at a non-denominational Christian church in Mesa, AZ for a couple years, and I&rsquo;m employed as the graphic designer. But anyways, here is two logos to show you the original, and now the updated one I made recently.</p>

<p>But I am curious about the design sensibility. What does it mean? What should a potential member take from the choice of font and the way it&rsquo;s presented?</p>
<p>The letters seems spaced a bit close to me. If the sign is huge that&rsquo;s one thing. But on a T-shirt or smaller I might loosen up the kerning a bit.</p>

<p>i think the icon lost a bit on impact/energy.
before it was running over the edges of the
&ldquo;O&rdquo; which made it more dynamic than having
it in the circle.</p>
<p>it seems the man/woman tries to jump out
and bangs his/her head on the circle&hellip;</p>
<p>also the doted line doesn&rsquo;t do it for me, 
it seems it has been placed without a reason&hellip;</p>
<p>just my two cents/rappen</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks so much for the input!</p>
<p>I see the most questions are regarding Helvetica&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, if you guys have seen a typical church logo, it always seems to have crosses, rivers, mountains, etc., along with fancy serif&rsquo;d fonts and such.</p>
<p>The biggest issue for me was common stereotypes associated with &lsquo;church.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t believe that crosses, rivers, mountains and all fit any demographic at all anymore. And although real church&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t necessarily target any specific demographic, the identity should be simple and neutral.</p>
<p>The reason I used Helvetica as just an initial idea was because of it&rsquo;s legibility from distances. It is more fuller in my opinion, and is easier to read if it was to be on a sign. As opposed to the first logo I&rsquo;ve shown that is News Gothic Standard.</p>
<p>Also, about the design itself, the original logo before I made the &lsquo;old&rsquo; one was just the character logo that had &lsquo;Spring of Life&rsquo; adjacent to it in a horrible font called &lsquo;Rage Italic&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of open logos (logos that have no distinct shape) and &lsquo;he&rsquo; the logo just kinda was standing alone.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks again for the advice! I&rsquo;ll see what else I can do with it!</p>
<p>Ty</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For me Helvetica reads as &ldquo;middle of the road&rdquo; and Consumer oriented. The dots are weird to see in a church logo too - but they are doing a job - separating elements so I can&rsquo;t ding them except maybe to question the tone they set which is a bit techy maybe. I think you might want to look at other Sans faces as well. What about something with a hint of humanism about it? Maybe something like this?</p>

<p>(depending on intent of course)</p>
<p>Speaking of which; I would encourage you not merely to break with the previous graphic language ( saying what you are not ) but to describe as fully as you can how the new graphics should read ( saying what you are ).</p>
<p>I will be interested to see how you proceed.</p>

<p>To me what is important is that even though it is getting better ( it is) I really think it won&rsquo;t become really good until you can describe what you are after and why. Only then can your choices be deliberate.</p>
<p>You can always make something that comes close to being a good design by following typographic &ldquo;rules&rdquo; or by emulating other designs you like but you can&rsquo;t get past a 50% or 60% success without serious consideration of the context. Until that happens the design isn&rsquo;t grounded in it&rsquo;s purpose. And it will niggle you like a loose tooth or badly fitting clothing because it won&rsquo;t be quite right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to brow beat you here. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way. Quite the opposite. I hope this helps reduce frustration while you are designing.</p>

<p>Eben - No, not at all, you&rsquo;re helping me out a lot. This is the first opportunity I&rsquo;ve had to been in community with other designers/typographers, and everyone is making really valid suggestions and critiques.</p>
<p>Now about the logo&hellip; To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m after. Since I&rsquo;m NOT the original designer of the identity (the jumping man), and the fact that I will never be allowed to design a new one, I&rsquo;m pretty much stuck with a graphic that I don&rsquo;t know what to do anything with. Unfortunately, when the original designer thought of &lsquo;Spring of Life&rsquo; he/she thought of a image of an abstract humanoid slipping on an oil slick, lol. So like I said, since the logo has been established going on 10 years&hellip; I&rsquo;m at a lost.</p>
<p>Anyways, I haven&rsquo;t even been authorized to try and develop a new identity using the old graphic, I was just trying to make it more appealing in a design perspective.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for framing the situation. I understand what you are facing better now. I would suggest that as much as you might be able to do by skirting the issue you might request that the church sanction what you are doing in a broader way. Then they could partner with you to develop a clear idea of the message that a new logo/identity might allow. Maybe this is just me but designing around the edges guerilla style and without any involvement or conceptual &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo; has always been a recipe for headaches for me. It just never felt worthwhile or satisfying. Maybe you can handle it better than me. :-) Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>1 - I definitely think you&rsquo;re moving in a better direction, but why Century Gothic? Do you happen to have Avenir on your system, Century Gothic is a pale derivative of Frutiger&rsquo;s genius face.</p>
<p>2 - Have you thought about just ditching the circle around the jumping figure? Or creating a transparent gradient so that it is jumping &ldquo;out&rdquo; of something, but jumps into the more &ldquo;ethereal&rdquo;. The only problem with that approach is you have to keep the logo in Illustrator format, not generic EPS, however, you can retain spot colors doing a gradient like that in Illy. It could be worth looking into.</p>
<p>3 - I agree with one of the earlier comments who said the bottom eyebrow &ldquo;Christian Church&rdquo; is probably a little too close, vertically, to the name. I assume this will have to go on a website and other placements where the render size could be as small as 100 px vertical, so that&rsquo;s going to shrink down really fast. Maybe do two logos? One for print over a certain size and one for small print/web sizing?</p>
<p>I do like the evolution, no pun intended =)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Any recommendations on the fonts?</p>
<p>I agree that Helvetica Standard isn&rsquo;t really working, but what about other variations? I&rsquo;m a really big fan of Neue Helvetica 23 Ultra Light Extended ( <a href="http://www.linotype.com/13103/neuehelvetica23ultralightextended-font.html">http://www.linotype.com/13103/neuehelvetica23ultralightextended-font.html</a> ), or maybe Basic Commercial in Bold Extended, but the main thing is that I want to stick with a sans-serif font.</p>
<p>The majority of serif fonts feel corporate and business like to me. And that&rsquo;s one thing a church should not be associated with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really trying to get a budget approval on purchasing maybe a few font packages from Linotype, but I&rsquo;m the youngest person on staff by 17 years, and my font preference doesn&rsquo;t seem to agree with the older people on staff :[[</p>
<p>But in the meantime, I&rsquo;m still looking for a font that fits the identity of our church.</p>

<p>That really interesting because I associate the other way. I don&rsquo;t think you or I are wrong or right about this. I don&rsquo;t think you can be. But it would be interesting to see if that&rsquo;s how other people feel too.</p>
<p>What about a humanistic sans like Beorcana? Maybe that would help with the other members too. I think it feels really warm &amp; human!</p>
