body: "The new Los Angeles Times Sunday magazine came out a few weeks ago with a new
  logo,which looked very much like the New York Times Sunday Magazine logo. Creative
  director Rip Georges replied with a suggestion that the origins of the initial cap
  type logo could be found many places...it's questionable. For more on the discussion,

  body: One of the comments is right, it's more than the logo that was ripped. The
    LA mag cover isn't new in any respect.

  body: If the LA CD really wants to claim he was more influenced by Mister Cartoon
    than, say, the NYT he would have stepped out from using the same text face as
    the word mark. The choice in lettering hardly resembles west coast script at all
    IMO.

  body: It's not the same typeface (the Times logo is lettering, not from a font)
    but I agree the styles are very similar.
