body: Hi, <BR>This is a font I&#39;ve been working on for quite some time now, but
  I can&#39;t seem to finish it. I rebuild it now 2 times new, but somewhere I keep
  having an invisible border. <BR>Perhaps Philip Cavette has some good ideas. I like
  his fonts and would appreciate his opinion. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12042.jpg"
  alt="Vagebond"> <BR> <BR>I have some problems with the &#34;2&#34;, &#34;x&#34;
  and &#34;&#60;&#34;. Does anyone have some ideas on how to improve them? <BR>I&#39;m
  working on the other special characters. I have some ideas on them and will post
  them very soon.  <BR>From this font I will also make different weight and italics.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren

  body: I like the texture. Just the &#34;R&#34; needs a different leg, and do compensate
    for the clotting &#40;like in the join of the &#34;e&#34;&#41;. And make a lighter
    weight. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    &#34;h&#34; &#34;w&#34; alot,but &#34;e&#34; and &#34;g&#34; maybe seems a little
    bit unbalanced. <BR>

  body: Hrant, would you make it a vertical leg then? I kind of like the diagonal
    leg. It gives the font a little rythem.  <BR>The clotting parts will be corrected
    soon. Also there will be a lighter weight, this version will be the startingpoint.
    But first the kapitals. <BR>I tried skewing it in Fontographer and that looks
    great. It gives in more a fast, spacy, techno look to it. I will also try to make
    a condensed.  <BR> <BR>Per, is it the short lower part of the &#39;e&#39; and
    &#39;g&#39; that you think makes it unbalaned? I could try making it longer. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for your time, <BR>Ren

    forward. <BR> <BR>Italic: skewing is probably your best bet, but I&#39;m thinking
    it should be a strong angle, which means the necessity of correcting the inevitable
    distortions will be great. Also, I&#39;d introduce some shears into the vertical
    stroke endings &#40;and maybe all of them&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant, that is too much for my English. What exactly is a shear? <BR>And yes,
    the angle will be strong. Therefor I will propably have to correct all the curves.

  body: Hmmm, I think I used the opposite word! In a Roman &#40;upright&#41; font
    a shear is when the ending of a stroke &#40;like a vertical stem&#41; is not flat,
    it&#39;s at an angle &#40;usually &#34;uphill&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>In an italic,
    a flat ending is already at an angle to the stem! But I was thinking leaving it
    like that makes the italic &#34;boring&#34;, so maybe you can try making the ending
    either perpendicular to the stroke &#40;which would make the letters look like
    they&#39;re falling forward&#41;, or try making the endings <i>more</i> sheared
    &#40;uphill&#41;, which would make the letters look... sharper? Not sure. <BR>

  body: Hi David, <BR> <BR>I realised I was always busy with fonts, from an early
    time. Somehow I seem to have forgotten that. But not really, because one day I
    started again. Out of nothing.  <BR> <BR>I have propably no interesting story
    behind this font. I just started on an idea in my sketchbook and very quickly
    started to build the glyphs in Freehand. I had an idea of the overall look and
    feel of the font. I wanted a monoline, so no thick-thin proportions. I wanted
    a font that is very open and, when typed in longer texts, it will start to look
    like a wallpaper. <BR>I&#39;m not looking for selling the font. It was mainly
    my early contact with font creating. I would like to do that in order to create
    fonts for myself to use in my work. <BR> <BR>Because the font is mainly based
    on a square with rounded edges, it was very easy to create the basic of the font.
    So I had no specific order in which to work.  <BR>That is maybe also part of the
    problem. I wish I knew how to handle a fontcreation like that. I&#39;m a graphic
    designer and know about typography, but not &#40;enough&#41; about font creation.
    Is there an order in which to work or to handle a project like this? <BR> <BR>I
    rebuild the font because, in my FOG, there was no room for the kapitals, etc,
    etc, etc. Perhaps thats also the fact that I can&#39;t seem to finish it. I did
    so much for it that maybe I&#39;m over the point. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have some
    info on how to deal with font creation? Guidelines, background info, etc. I know
    it is a profession for itself, but it has to be possible to do it semi-professionally.

  body: did some alterations, not sure if they&#39;re any better. I like the font
    the way it is, including the &#34;r&#34; and the &#34;&#60;&#34;. If you were
    to do Caps maybe consider making them taller than the lower case, rather than
    having upper and lower case all be one xheight. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12538.gif"

  body: Hi Phillip, <BR> <BR>Thanx again for your opinion. Like I said I also had
    some problems with those characters. The first &#39;x&#39; is not bad, though
    it would have to be wider. I wanted to optically correct it a bit, but keep the
    vertical idea. But this little diagonal touch is great. The second one is not
    it, for me.  <BR>The &#39;2&#39; is a good suggestion. I will try to make the
    lower horizontal line a little longer. It is just a little to heavy at the top.
    But other than that it&#39;s better than before. <BR> <BR>Concerning the caps,
    yes I will make them bigger than the x-height. I wanted to take the top hight
    of the font and make them all as &#39;squared&#39; as the lowercases. <BR> <BR>The
    &#39;r&#39; I will leave like that. I will adjust the cluttering a little, but
    I kind of like that diagonal there. <BR> <BR>Ren

    the most recent version of the Vagebond. I finally found some time again to work
    on it. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19365.gif" alt="Character

    text. I have some ideas about enhancing the type. I will do so in the near future.
    This is at least the basic with which I will create the rest of the family. <BR><img

  body: Hi Ricardo, <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right. Now that you say it, it makes sence.
    The @ is too small because I never planned to make capitals. I wanted to keep
    it on the same hight as the LC&#39;s, but it can be bigger.  <BR>I will also change
    the =. It is indeed too close together. That is the finetuning I need. <BR>What
    do you think about the spacing? Is it not to close? I think it&#39;s OK, but the
    issue of legibility is also important to me. If I can increase it a bit I will
    try that. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the tips. <BR>Ren
