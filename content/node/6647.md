  body: It looks to me like the sort of bitmap &#39;fonts&#39; that were used in video
    games in the 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s. I think not much relation to present
    day fonts, which are much higher resolution. <BR> <BR>Do a search at MyFonts.com
    with the word &#39;Blackletter&#39;, and you will see many similar digitial fonts,
    of much higher quality.

  body: thanks for the reply. <BR> <BR>yes, it&#39;s from a videogame of 80&#39;s
    and I know the resolution is poor but I have searched myfonts.com with blackletter
    and i haven&#39;t seen any font with the same &#39;Y&#39; as the link I provided.
    There are fonts very similar, but I haven&#39;t found the same. Maybe it was a
    custom modification? <BR> <BR>Thanks anyway.
