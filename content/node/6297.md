  body: The black instrument looks more like a clarinet than a soprano sax. The choice
    of type doesn&#39;t say &#34;jazz&#34; to me, at least not the &#34;non-modern&#34;
    way you sound.  <BR>The instrument in the middle is also a bit confusing /distracting.
    <BR> <BR>In finnish &#34;ME 3&#34; would read like &#34;US 3&#34; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Either show a soprano sax, guitar and bass or make it clear its the Michael
    Ebert &#40;Soprano Sax&#41; led trio. I have the Frank Sinatra with Red Norvo
    Quientet Live in Australia 11959 CD. Red Norvo didn&#39;t need a logo, I don&#39;t
    think you do either.  <BR> <BR>Do you know WBGO 88.3 FM out of Newark, NJ? The
    best Jazz Station in the east coast of the US.

  body: Hey Michael <BR> <BR>i agree that for a jazz trio you shouldn&#39;t think
    on a logo. I think a typographic solution is the best. I am thinking on puting
    ME above the horizontal of the 3, and also i an wondering how it would look with
    the M3, flipping horizontaly the 3. <BR> <BR>nice song ;-&#41;, i like the variations
    on the 1:03 min <BR> <BR>CG

  body: Thanks for the helpful advice, folks! I&#39;m going to keep toying with this.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;The logo is for gig posters &amp; flyers, incidentally.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ll post any further amendments when I can. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>--M.
