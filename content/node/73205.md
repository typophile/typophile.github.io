  over, and the program needs some serious taste adjustments. The book is focused
  on some very specific music genres and I really feel a modern style sans fits the
  bill, to replace the current Gill Sans, but before I bite the bullet on finally
  purchasing one of my two \"A-listers\", I thought I'd see if I was missing a key
  player. \r\n\r\nVerlag from H&FJ and Relay from FB both seem like the head of the
  pack here. The term is a lift from Hoefler's descrip of Verlag, and I find it to
  be quite right. I definitely value the breadth of options they provide (three and
  four widths, respectively, each in five weights plus italics) and find that essential
  for the task at hand. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any other ideas? I'd love to hear
  them and explore. \r\n\r\nThanks much!\r\n\r\n-e"

  body: Contrary to the puffery in H&amp;FJ's romance copy on Verlag, sans serifs
    would be used in heads and subheads and, in some instances, classified ad copy
    in Western newsrooms of the day. Body copy was almost always set in a serif face.

    right,\" merely that the descriptive \"Pre-War Modern\" was. In any case, I'm
    not looking for the historical accuracy in use, so much as the style. Verlag and
    Relay both have this flare and glamour that I find particularly well suited for
    the task at hand, and they're both extremely well appointed, legible, and versatile.\r\n\r\nAnyhoo...other
    thoughts?\r\n\r\ntx much\r\n\r\n-e"

    same time as Relay and Neutraface and I <a href=\"http://typographica.org/2006/on-typography/verlag-the-latest-pre-war-modernist-sans/\">wrote
    about this at the time</a>.\r\n\r\nJames, so glad to see another option in this
    genre. Looking forward to seeing more of 718."

  body: "Stephen,  \r\n\r\nWhat a great read. I also have a fondness for Verlag (so
    it's nice to get a vote of confidence in that one), though I've never actually
    used it, hence my opening up the question and looking for other ways in (before
    I drop anywhere from $500 to a grand, I want to make sure I've covered my bases).
    My only reservation with Verlag, and for that matter, Relay, has been that I think
    they may now be a bit exposed now, particularly Verlag. Which in and of itself
    doesn't make them bad choices, but you know, Art Director and all, we like to
    feel we've made some unique breakthrough or whatever. True voice, ego-puffery,
    blah, blah, blah. \r\n\r\nI once worked for a publication with a slightly customized
    cut of Relay and I grew to *love* it. It's flexibility always astounded me, and
    well, I suppose that was the first time I came to understand the value of something
    like a superfamily. Funny, though, the retail version always hits my eye a little
    abruptly now. We had one of the more angular forms customized to round off and
    it always read better after that. The lack of said character now makes me pause
    before clicking the \"add to cart\" button. Neutraface is one of my all-time favorites,
    but having worked with it briefly on a project years ago, it has idiosyncrasies
    that I find distracting, particularly in text settings, much as I love it. And
    while I think the italic is beautiful, I don't find it particularly legible for
    the reader in the smallest settings.\r\n\r\nSo now I find myself ready to pull
    a trigger and wondering if there's still a lot of territory to cover that I missed.
    Though, apparently, there is not. James' 718 is very attractive, and I'm quite
    taken with it. I, too, look forward to seeing more of it."

    you're in danger of overexposure unless your competition is using it.

  body: "Both very nice, thanks. \r\n\r\nFrode, both Neutraface families are quite
    dramatic. I find them both striking and beautiful and I love the flexibility in
    their many drawings, but I do still find the exaggerated X-heights in Neutraface
    particularly difficult to read out of running copy, even with the adjusted text-face
    heights. It just doesn't hold in running copy next to Relay or Verlag...which
    is kind of too bad, because I like a lot of the personality in the face.\r\n\r\nBrandon
    Grotesque is a lovely face; also find its price attractive, even if it's not the
    most flexible in terms of widths. Many choices..."

  body: I'll add a bit to the mix and let you all know that I am working on a commercial
    release of [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/customfonts/fonts/vfsans/|VF Sans]]
    that should be ready next month. It will include my normal extended character
    set, small caps and such. I'll be offering more weights than the original, and
    the [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/customfonts/fonts/vfsanscondensed/|VF Sans
    Condensed]] will be included, but I'm not sure about italics. The custom version
    I did for Vanity Fair had simple obliques. I think geometric sans probably can
    get by with obliques. But being a display system, maybe they're not needed at
    all.
