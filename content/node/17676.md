  body: "Definitely hand drawn -- the legs of the two N's are different widths. Stephen's
    suggestion is good, and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Nick+Curtis\"
    target=\"new\">Nick Curtis</a> has many designs from this era, in both his freeware
    and buyware fonts. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
