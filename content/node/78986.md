  body: "I've looked through my Script Guide and this style of C is very atypical.
    If this is a commercial font it is something recent (or customized).\r\n\r\nHave
    you looked at Veer? That is probably the site that has a higher proportion of
    script fonts than any other commercial site.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, I believe i did include veer in my search. I agree about the unusual
    cap C. I would have guessed this might have been a custom font but I have seen
    it in use in other places so it must be universally available somewhere...\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your expertise.\r\n\r\n~Laurie"
