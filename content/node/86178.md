body: "Hi,\r\nI'm a designer from Oxford, UK. I've been working in the industry for
  five years and, touch wood, things are going pretty well. My main area of interest
  lies in contemporary applications of traditional methods. I've been letterpress
  printing for 6\u20137 years but have become increasingly aware that my work could
  sometimes benefit from custom lettering. Not to jump on the band wagon of Jessica
  Hische et al, current trends seem to be moving in that direction and I'd love to
  be a part of it!\r\n\r\nIn my time as a letterpress printer I was lucky enough to
  work with a very skilled and experienced (and sought after) printer. I'd love to
  get in touch with an experienced hand lettering artist who could pass on tips and
  pass just the occasional eye over work in progress.\r\nI tend to work with pencil
  (sketching and draughting) and then produce the final design in Adobe Illustrator.
  \r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n\r\nMany thanks"

    painting, carving, forging, casting \u2026 and much more. I suppose the simple
    way to get startet is to just show us threee images of what you do and then, according
    to experience, typophiles will not let you wait that long with some feedback.\r\nOr
    do you think of hiring a sort of personal tutor?"

  body: You should probably post the  projects that Andreas just mentioned to the
    "Critique" area of this forum and title it with the Words "Lettering Help".  The
    experienced lettering members of this forum will be glad to help you.

  body: "I agree with Andreas. People in lettering tend to come from a lot of different
    angles to lettering. Folks like John Downer and Charles Borges de Oliveira, for
    example, came from a sign painting background and signs of this are in their work.
    Myself, Michael Clark, and others came from the calligraphy tradition and this
    shows in our work. Some folks have always drawn lettering and their sensitivity
    to letter forms varies greatly. Folks like Doyald Young (RIP) and Jessica Hische
    have a knack for very well drawn letters. Some folks with less technical skills
    at lettering per se have a very fun and illustrative styles. Nate Williams comes
    to mind in that realm. \r\n\r\nYou might start by scouring sites like welovetypography
    or flickr for people who's style you admire. And, of course, feel free to post
    samples for critique. "
