  Victor, and Talking Machines/Records & Supplies in this picture. I think I can find
  a close equivalent for the 81 and Talking Machines... but am at a loss regarding
  the Owens, Beers, and Victore.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/-1_4337.jpg]"

  body: This looks like a fairly old image. I'm guessing that it is old and that those
    are all lettered. You can find a lot of similar fonts at <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/viewallfonts/">Letterhead
