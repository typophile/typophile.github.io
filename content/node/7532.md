body: Hi everyone, I&#39;ve got a research question, and I could use your help. <BR>
  <BR>Many students the world over are interested in typography and type design. Some
  of them go on to attend fine graduate schools like Reading or KABK. Some are lucky
  enough to have great teachers at any number of other schools they might attend.
  Some of them learn entirely through self-teaching. <BR> <BR>In the current state
  of the graphic design industry, and the global economy in general, it can be quite
  difficult for a student to get a job after graduation. Traditionally, students have
  done a number of things to improve their chances and their r

  body: Ramiro, were either of these &#34;founded&#34; or started by students, or

    with these groups?

  body: Well, I think both groups were founded by teachers. &#39;T-C&#39; was originally
    an idea of Ruben Fontana who sent invitations for starting a group interested
    in organizing conferences and workshops. Students take part in the grup but I
    don&#39;t know the number... you can ask them.  <BR>&#39;Tipitos&#39; was &#40;I
    think again...&#41; an idea of Aldo de Losa and is composed mostly by student.
    It&#39;s a kind of permanent workshop focused in type design.

  body: Thanks for the clarification, Ramiro, but I&#39;m looking for things that
    were founded independently and extracurricularly. Maybe there just aren&#39;t
    very many, or as many as I assumed that there would be. <BR> <BR>One other group
    that I found was Viagrafik, also German
