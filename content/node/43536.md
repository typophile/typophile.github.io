  a font that's been used a little obscurely. It's like a sans or slab serif with
  slanted Ms Ws As Ys. \r\n\r\nIt's a very retro 1970s and 1980s font. It was used
  in the title of the \r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Moonlighting.jpg/200px-Moonlighting.jpg\r\n\r\nmoonlighting

  body: 'Thanks Lex. I was thinking it was an Avant Garde font, but I didn''t know
    anything about the alternates. I''ve noticed it''s been really around a lot now.
