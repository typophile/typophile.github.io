  issues. Among them are promises I never kept. Like posting the text of the foreword
  I wrote for Neil Macmillan\u2019s book <em>An A-Z of Type Designers</em>. Here it
  is now, freshly formatted into a pdf."

  body: If the article is being republished I should point out a tiny typo "Open Type"
    should be all one word. Also at the end of section 2, "It it" should be "It is".

    all our own worst proof-readers. Cannot be bothered to change the pdf now. Not

  body: "<em>appears to be one of eight essays and not the books foreword</em>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    right: not the foreword. I haven\u2019t got the book here in SF so couldn\u2019t
    check. I write quite a few forewords for friends featuring font topics (those
    were six alliterations), like for Rian Hughes\u2019 book or House Industries etc.
    But now and again I actually write more than a few sentences. Sorry about the
    sloppy editing on my part, but these things normally get sent out in an email
    late at night without sleeping on it and going back to clean up both typos and
    style in the morning."

    after you posted it. A particular form of editing can be removing all of its contents
    :) \r\n\r\nA."
