  body: Whew... that lowercase &#34;f&#34; seems like the defining character... thus,
    I haven&#39;t been able to find it thus far.  Usually I&#39;m all over these pixel
    fonts...

  body: it is odd, I quite know the pixel fonts too but I am really stumped here.

  body: I believe this is a customization of Supermarket, possibly Supermonomarket,
    which is an inhouse Group94 customization of Supermarket by Sven Stuber, which
    can be found at <a href="http://www.superlooper.de" target="_blank">Superlooper</a>.
    The customization is not, as far as I know, publically available. Group 94 also
    had some larger pixel fonts  that were custom made &#40;perhaps stansharp, among
    others&#41;, and there were rumors that some of these may eventually be made     public,
    but I don&#39;t know what happened to those rumors.  For more information, consult
