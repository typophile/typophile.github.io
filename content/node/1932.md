  body: I was hesitating to say that, because the sample looks  <BR>rounder and there
    are some idiosyncracies. It clearly  <BR>bears Benguiat&#39;s signature, that&#39;s
    for sure. When I  <BR>checked ITC Bookman, I noticed none of the weights  <BR>has
    this sloping e-bar. Is this a specific feature of the  <BR>Swash variant, or do
    you think they rotated it?
