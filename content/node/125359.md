body: " Hi everyone\r\nWe are two young graphic designers from Switzerland that are
  obsessed with type. We just started designing our first typeface and our biggest
  problem is that we don\u2019t really have anyone experienced to critique our typeface
  and show us \u201Chow it\u2019s done\u201D. So please, rip it to shreds :)\r\nAlso
  English is not our first language so excuse us if we used the wrong typographic
  terms. We hope it\u2019s still readable.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the typeface:\r\nWe
  wanted to create a modern typeface that references and gets people interested in
  the history of how the individual letters developed and came about. Thats why there
  are uncoventional characters for a grotesque typeface and also why a lot of characteristics
  (hard counters that connect to the stem) reference old blackletter style.\r\nFor
  example the diaeresis (\xA8) was first an e that was written above the letter to
  modify the sound of the vowel.\r\nAlso we used the old characters of the long s
  and the old variant of the hyphen.\r\nFor the look and feel we referenced the classic
  german grotesque typefaces of the 18th century (venus, royal, ideal grotesk to name
  a few).\r\n\r\nThe typeface is in no way finished or even close to it, so most of
  it is up change. Our current plan looks like this(if in your experience a different
  workflow would be better please tell us):\r\n- Create a basic typeface weight with
  all Letters (numbers still missing)\r\n- Get as much feedback and critique as possible
  and also take a hard look at the typeface ourselves (current stage)\r\n- Finish
  the first weight (additional Glyphs, Kerning, Hinting)\r\n- Expand it, create Light,
  Italics, Bold and more versions of the first weight\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t really
  think that we will have a final version in the next months so we are just beginning!\r\n\r\nWe
  are really excited to hear your feedback on our first attempt on a typeface"

      to also post it here. I hope that this is ok and it doesn't break any rules,
      we will be happy to change the post or provide further information if something
      is missing.\r\nWe were just really excited to get into the world of type design

  body: It's more than OK! This is a great place to get feedback. I was just hoping
    to avoid re-posting my feedback.

    little bit off: F and Z seem a bit light in this sample.'

    We're not quite there but we are unifying the terminals and characters.\r\nWhat
    do you mean to the new upper case letters ? :-)"

  body: "How far back are you going with this? There is so much to explore, but still
    hard to be consequent: The comma originated from a lowered, reduced, virgulae
    (slash). W was two u\u2019s merged together. Many such historical letter variants
    have their own Unicode slot, as for example the superscript e above. (In fact,
    the modern dieresis and raised e lived side by side in late medieval/early renaissance
    manuscripts and printed books.)"
