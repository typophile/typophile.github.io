  body: The new Sony logo is customized <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/digital-sans/ef-medium/testdrive.html?s=Sony+Ericsson&p=72">Digital
    Sans</a>.. and noting the differing "l" characters in Hallmark, I'd agree with
    Patty that it's completely custom script.

    to have created the cherry festival ID. If the font is that important to you,
    I guess you could always try asking them for reference."
