body: "Fellow typophiles and writing enthusiasts,\r\n\r\nI came from my design class
  the other day with a question, one which lacks importance and urgency on all possible
  fronts:\r\n\"What is the perfect format for a university grade essay?\"\r\n\r\nNow
  we all know that the content of an essay is the most important aspect of it, however,
  my professor hypothesized that the actual format (typeface, margins, kerning, ligatures,
  etc) has an unsung importance to the overall essay.\r\n\r\nMyself being a rookie
  in typography (in contrast the other members on this forum), I come to you with
  the simple question, what is the perfect essay format?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "What I find annoying about Times New Roman is the lack of ligature.  And
    I find the kerning to be quite tight, and the serif's to be over dramatic.  Henceforth,
    that is the reason why I believe there has to be a better type then what modern
    culture has dubbed to be the <em>\"best\"</em>.  Now I realize that it is possible
    to adjust the kerning, but that doesn't solve the serif and ligature issue I have
    with it.\r\n\r\nFrankly, the question at hand isn't so much the overall format
    of the paper, but through revision of my own though, what is a suitable typeface
    for reading?  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n"
