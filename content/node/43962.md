  body: Yes, fontXchange might convert your TTf or post script files into OTF but
    its like opening an existing font itno FontLab and saving it as OTF. You cant
    really get those real open type features until unless you have them in the font,
    also it needs lots of coding. And no font vendor will allow us to do that without
    their prior permission.
