  body: "Chaparral includes lowercase figures (often called \"oldstyle\" figures).
    They are not the default, so you have to activate the OpenType \"Oldstyle Figures\"
    feature in your software. If your software does not support OT features, then
    you'll need to find a way to insert them manually from a glyph map. \r\n\r\nIf
    you happen to be using an old Postscript version of Chaparral, then you'll need
    to change the font of your numbers to Chaparral Expert to get the oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\n--
