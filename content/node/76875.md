  scanned then inked it in illustrator. This is the first time I've ever done anything
  like this. There are a few things I want to change, would like to hear your opinions/criticisms.\r\n\r\nI
  wrote the word 'eleven' :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elevn_4315.jpg]"

  body: The exit stroke of e isn't fluid. The loop of v is a bit wonky.

  body: "I concur with riccard0: the flow doesn\u2019t work. Imagine writing this
    with a pen and try to emulate that \u2014 eg: upstroke of e = loop of l, etcetera."

  body: Well it's not as constructive but I'm gonna say it looks quite nice. Smooth
    out a few curves and you've got yourself a very attractive script.
