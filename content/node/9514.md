  body: Theirry, here at Typophile we don&#39;t support free alternatives.  Type designers
    put a lot of hard work into their fonts, and expect &#40;as they should&#41; to
    get paid for the work they&#39;ve done, much like you or I have a job.  I&#39;d
    go into more detail, but I&#39;m sure Yves or someone will jump in and add their
    two cents. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
