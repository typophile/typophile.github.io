  Europe - I was sent here by a co-worker of mine - she's a great fan of the site.
  So, here's my humble \"cry for help\" :) :\r\n\r\nAfter few years of being employed,
  I decided to finnaly start with my private business as well. Mostly, I m preoccupied
  with webdesign but also work in the fields of illustration, logo creation and print
  design. So, in order to keep things neat, I need to come up with a good logo solution
  that will (hopefully successfully) represent me. Since I go by the nickname \"Gofra\"
  on most of the sites I decided to stick with this as my \"brand\" name (It's made
  of two parts of my first and last name - \"GO\" from Gorjanc < my last name and
  \"FRA\" from Frane < first three letters of my first name). Now, I've been thinkig
  of a solution in shape of a \"fg\" or \"gf\" logo and have also drawn some examples
  allready (will scan later in the evening) but what I would really love to see is
  some examples of ligatures.\r\n\r\nSo if anyone knows about examples, please - I'd
  be thankfull!\r\nAlso, if someone knows or suggest better ideas on resolving this
  issue, I'd appreaciate it a lot!\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\nFrane"

  body: It may be hard to find real 'fg' or 'gf' ligatures. Not a ligature but 'gf'
    in Grotext <a href="http://www.kltf.de/stuff/gf_in_KLTFGrotext.jpg" target="_blank">join
    like this</a>. Another decision to make is whether you go by Gofra (= 'gf') or
    by your real name (= 'fg'). The latter would allow, depending on the design of
    the letters, that the f reaches out above the g and g reaches out below the f.
    Perhaps it makes more sense if you post what you have, and then the crowd can
    tell which solutions are possible and which are not.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)

  body: Stay away from the lower case ones. They look too much like a ligature of
    o f, spelling of. I think the middle row shows promise. What about the last one
    on that row, but with the cross bars only half as far from the central stem.

    with the arm of the f.

  body: I find the two left ones in the second row most interesting though perhaps
    hard to decipher -- the stem serves both G and F but seems to be associated more
    with the F, which makes the G look like a C. (Similar case with the others in
    this row.) Perhaps it works better if the bottom curve of the G moves up again
    on the right side, and if you add a little square inside of the G like in the
    version to the very right which would indicate a little bar as in Gill Sans G.

  body: "In the second pass, two of them look like C F. I do like the one at the end
    of the middle row better than the prior version, but it still doesn't work for
    me. I'd suggest dropping the entire ligature idea, and play with other ideas.
    Remember, you can add other things into a logo other than letters.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    a swoosh wouldn't work, but there are other less hackneyed graphic shapes that
    might help you build your logo."

    I'm not that worried that some people might not that read that as FG. What worries
    me more is if this cubic form is suitable for representing someone that doesn't

    and of course, I need to choose correct colours and define contrasts better. Maybe
    I'll do an example with a wireframe (semi transparent or not transparent at all)
    as well. Perhaps a different angle (maybe even a real perspective) might work
    better too...\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nFrane"

    I am going to ask, do you aim to be associated with that history?\r\n\r\nI do
    not think having a 3D logo implies that you do animated 3D graphics :)"

    will start with integration with type (\"Gofras graphic design\" or simply \"Gofras\").\r\n\r\nthanks

    space aspect works really well. The F is instantly visible, but you have to wait
    for the G to appear. It is a bit like the arrow in the FedEx logo. Once you see
    it (or it is pointed out to you) you never forget it, and see it every time you
    see the logo.\r\n\r\nBTW, this is an excellent example of logo design development.
    Would you mind if I used your images in a class I hope to be building in a year
    or two?"

    together with the logo. I think something calssic and light would work well -
    like Frutiger here in example: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_real_4255.gif]\r\n\r\nHow
    does that seem to you? Mind you, I haven't got the font yet (yet to buy one) -
    this is just a printscreen of samples I made on fonts.com, so kerning and spacing
