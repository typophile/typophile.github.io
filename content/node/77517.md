  body: Yes, these are often printed with machines that use proprietary fonts. No
    desktop font will match exactly. <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/telidon-ink?refby=typographica">Telidon
    Ink</a> or  <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_ticket_ot/?affid=99346">FF
    Ticket</a> are decent substitutes.
