  is through FontForge which I'm having a hard time using.  I've already designed
  all the basic letter in Inkscape but they always come out with the wrong spacing
  and wrong height.  Also, when I try to save I always get errors on the letters which
  ruin the design.  Can someone help me with this?  I tried really hard.\r\n\r\nHere
  is the font I'm try to make.\r\nhttp://willhostforfood.com/users/M/mega_rock_exe/BN_Title_font.svg"

    get the book 'Learn FontLab Fast by Leslie Cabarga':\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Fontlab&x=0&y=0\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: '[[http://briem.net/|Briem''s online tutorial]] is IMHO the best place to
    start. Letters of Credit by Walter Tracy is extremely helpful, as is Cabaraga''s
    Learn FontLab fast. I learned a lot from Fonts & Logos by Doyald Young. Karen
    Cheng''s book is not a must have, though it has helpful comparisons of different
    fonts. The most important things are to study other fonts you admire in a font
    drawing program, see how they work on paper and screen, and draw, draw, draw. '

    try FontLab.

  body: Or get <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/">TypeTool</a>
    instead. It's a lot less daunting -- and cheaper -- than FontLab, especially for
    someone making their first font.

    software for one font.  This is actually the only font I need to make.  Seems
    like too much of a hassle to get it and make the font and it isn't worth it.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone wants to make it, by all means go ahead.  I can't spend so much time on
    this anymore."
