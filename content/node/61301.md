  but I was wondering if there are any serif families that were designed or developed
  similar to Univers. Not that they would necessarily go well with Univers, but they
  would have the 20+ widths/weights and italics system.\r\n\r\nAre there serif faces
  with 20+ widths and weights (and italics)?\r\n\r\nDoes a thin ultra condensed or
  extra black extended serif exist?"

  body: "Hi Aaron,\r\nyes, there are a few.\r\nThe most obvious candidate would be
    URW Egyptienne, an expanded version of [[Adrian Frutiger|Frutiger]]\u2019s Serifa.
    AFAIK, this slab serif has 25 styles (widths + weights), each with obliques. The
    family ranges from Extralight Extranarrow to Extrawide Bold. Both extrema can\u2019t
    compete with sans systems like [[Univers]].\r\n\r\nURW Antiqua by [[Hermann Zapf]]
    \u2013 not a slab \u2013 has ~30 styles (excluding Outline styles), plus another
    ~30 italics (most \u2013 but not all \u2013 of them actually obliques). The narrowest
    weight is Regular Condensed, while the widest is Ultrabold Extrawide. There\u2019s
    also a Super: darker, but not expanded.\r\n\r\nNote that for serif typefaces,
    traditionally and intrinsically, there are aspects that are considered more important
    than sheer weight count. [[Optical Size|Optical sizes]], for instance. Or <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/ask/recentTopic.php?rtID=89\">grades</a>.
    Or <a href=\"http://www.teff.nl/fonts/ruse/\">contrast</a>. In case you\u2019re
    looking for records, note that [[Multiple Master]] typefaces let you generate
    an infinite number of styles, if you want to.\r\nF"

  body: "Font Bureau has been in the habit of making extensive width+weight ranges
    in many of its serif display families. You won't find the kind of extremes as
    in Univers, and especially not the more Extended widths. \r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonModernDisplay|Benton
    Modern Display]]</strong> -- 4 widths in 4 weights, plus 2 heavier weights in
    normal width\r\n<strong>[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Escrow|Escrow]]</strong>
    -- 3 widths in 5 weights (except only 4 weights in compressed width)\r\n<strong>[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ModernoFB|FB
    Moderno]]</strong> -- 4 widths in 4 weights\r\n<strong>[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Rocky|Rocky]]</strong>
    -- 4 widths in 4 weights\r\n\r\nAll of the above examples include italics for
    all styles.\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WhitmanDisplay|Whitman
    Display]]</strong> has 3 widths in 7 weights, but italics only in the normal width.
    (See also this [[http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmDisMap.html|style map]].)\r\n\r\nThe
    astute observer will notice that all of these fall more or less into the Modern
    genre, which is more amenable to this kind of range treatment.\r\n"

  body: "A number of families mentioned here are indeed extensive. But I wonder if
    the key to Aaron's initial question is a system of weights and widths -- not just
    extensive weights (and goodies) or optical versions.\r\n\r\nTo the examples I
    mentioned above, let me add H&FJ's [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100031|Chronicle
    Display]] which comes in three widths and several weights: 6 weights in normal,
    5 weights in condensed, and 4 weights in compressed width.\r\n\r\n@Nick: Good
    example. I think Matthew's reworking of Cheltenham for the NYT covered most of
    this ground, but I haven't seen the fonts themselves, so I can't say just how
    thorough or extensive the style grid is.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you all for so much good information.\r\n\r\n@ Florian: URW Antiqua
    caught my eye. The whole URW Antiqua and URW Egyptienne volume seemed like a very
    nice deal for the wide range of fonts in each family.\r\n\r\n@ Nick: I really
    enjoy Beaufort. Too bad you aren't making Pro versions of the other 20 fonts.
    Are the Pro versions and regular versions of the normal width interchangeable?
    If someone were to get the regular version, set something, and then later on get
    the Pro version, could they replace it without displacing the copy?\r\nAlso, where
    would I find McGrew?\r\n\r\n@ Kent: Rocky was news to me! I enjoy that face a
    lot. I've always wanted to see Latins that weren't as narrow as Birch or as extended
    as Wide Latin. Whitman Display's style map was also very helpful.\r\n\r\n@ Aa:
    I enjoy Minion and Warnock Pro (see avatar) and I love Warnock's optical sizes
    (caption, subhead, display) but they don't have the variety of widths I'm curious
    about.\r\n\r\n@ Christopher: Starling's heavier weights and italics are nice.
    Must be nice to design type AND and a be a playboy sailor...\r\n\r\n@ Bert: I
    feel like I find more fonts in the Thesis family every day. Did he make them all
    at once, or has he just been making them for a long time? Are there different
    widths of TheSerif?\r\n\r\nI suppose all this info leads me to another question:
    Did Frutiger use the numeral naming system on any serif faces, or have other designers?
    As far as available widths, URW Antiqua and Beaufort really impressed me. \r\n\r\nAny
    faces with more widths than the ones already mentioned?\r\n\r\nI understand serifs
    don't usually withstand the thin ultra condensed and extra black extended treatment,
    so lately I've been interested to see some. Thanks again for the responses. Apologies
    for the flurry of @."

  body: "David Berlow used a numbering system for Font Bureau's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Giza/styles|Giza]].
    \r\n\r\nFirst digit is weight (larger number = heavier) and second digit is width
    (larger number = wider).\r\n\r\nActually it's quite convoluted to follow. The
    confusion was compounded by the fact that the numbering system for FB's Bureau
    Grotesque was the opposite of Giza (width first, then weight) -- although that
    family has now been superceded by the expanded Bureau Grot, with more typical
    designations for weight and width.\r\n\r\nThe Giza styles were developed piecemeal
    for clients and so not all points in the grid are covered. "
