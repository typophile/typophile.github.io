  body: "I tried all the usual places for freebies, because I thought this looked
    like a hobbyist font for a game. I looked in almost every category I thought could
    be remotely descriptive of this, and I had no luck at all.\r\n\r\nI also looked
    at MyFonts for some descriptions I thought would work, but didn't see it there
    either.  I'd be surprised if this is a commercial font, but I know anything could
    be. I just couldn't find this anywhere either.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "
