  within a given font\r\nDo you stick to two heights in your designs (one for flat
  and one for curved/pointed); \r\nOr do you use three (flat, curve, and pointed);
  \r\nOr do you break it down further?"

  body: The flatter the top/bottom curve is the smaller the overshoot. Bold cuts are
    wider, thus the top/bottom curve is flatter than the thinner cuts, and the overshoot
    should thus be smaller. On the pointed ends I usually print out a waterfall and
    adjust until it looks right.

    why I would think the S would need <em>more</em> overshoot than, say, the O. I
    wonder if you reach a point where the vertical proportions of a letter like S
    (or its springy spine?) start to override that rule of thumb."

  body: "<cite>The flatter the top/bottom curve is the smaller the overshoot.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    why I recommend to look at the width of the overshoot, not the height/depth.\r\nIf
    you make the overshoot about 1/4 or 1/3 of the glyph width you will usually get
    a good result, whether the curve is flat or narrow. Typically works for me.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    you always need to judge visually, there is no way to pass that responsibility
    on to a mathematical rule.\r\n\r\nTo answer the initial question: normally two
    categories, but with exceptions (rather than a third one)."

  body: "I just checked Briem and my memory was off. It is greater than 2-3% according
    to him:\r\n\r\n\"How much [overshoot] depends on the design. In Times Roman, the
    letter o is 4% higher than the letter x. ... The letter o in Courier and Helvetica
    is 7% higher the the letter x,\"\r\n\r\nIn the font I am working on the lower
    case o is 4% taller than the x.  The O is 3% taller than the H. I went by looks
    rather than a rule; I did compare a number of fonts I like, though. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_6.pdf|Mark
    Jamra has a nice discussion]] of these issues. He reports that Peter Karnow in
    testing found that most people put a circle that is 3% greater diameter as the
    same size as a square. "

  body: "For a historical perspective, Harry Carter gives the following in a note
    to his translation of Fournier.\r\n\r\n\"To satisfy the eye a 6-pt. o has to be
    about one-eighth taller than the x, a 12-pt. one-twelfth, a 36-pt. one-fifteenth,
    and a 72-pt. one-eighteenth. The amount of difference required varies with the
    degree of the extension of the type and the shape of the shading.\" [<cite>Fournier
    on Typefounding</cite> p. 148 note]\r\n\r\nBut I've never done an extensive survey
    to see how these numbers jibe with current practices.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    what people would do today. \r\n\r\nI just checked the o vs x in the optical sizes
    of Adobe Jenson: caption-4.1%; regular-4.4%; subhead-4.5%; display-4.4% \r\n\r\nSo
    Slimbach didn't follow this guideline of lesser overshoots at bigger sizes.  "
