  work of mine. Looking for some opinions and maybe ideas related to this logo. It`s
  about a very new firm, design firm, trying new stuff in graphic design. unusual
  approach of everything. Something like \"we do it as we want not as you want\".\r\n\r\n

    you want\u201D.\r\nThis may be a good thing though because I'm sure most clients
    would be well put of by the suggestion.\r\n\r\nMy advice would be to simplify.\r\n\r\nIt's
    hard to give advice when you will end up doing what you want anyway, haha."

    like a stylized ultrasound of a pregnancy. Output, indeed.

    I believe that even for doing somethig unusual stuff you need to have a strong
    understanding of the usual things. And when you know the usual things very well,
    It becomes really difficult to do something unusual.\r\n\r\nKeep playing with
    visuals, not with Photoshop.\r\n\r\n"

    :)) the ethos was just a momentarily thought but it isn`t really an ethos, so...\r\nOf
    course i`m not gonna use that! anyway, the biology lab look alike is fine for
    me, as long as i have no other \"general picture\" of a design that might say
    something about graphic design at all. so yes, i could use some tips :D. \r\n\r\nIn
    other words i tried to go for an organic look, an organic feel as the general
    line for the logo. Since it looks as a biology lab logo to you i think i hit the
    target. The second  thing i wanted to pursue was to illustrate accomplishment,
    movement (dynamism) and outcome. And as any designer i thought that something
    different wouldn`t be that bad considering that this logo is going to be seen
    by ordinary people not graphic artists and critiques and so on. \r\n\r\nSome one
    has to admit that the logo fits the \"design laboratory\", doesn`t it? ;)\r\n\r\nCheers

  body: "\"Biology lab\" and \"organic\" are not compatible terms in my mind.  \r\n\r\nA
    lab can mean sterile, static, clean, harsh, controlled; even in a biology lab
    the natural things studied are placed in beakers, dishes and containers.  Organic
    means life, nature, leafy, messy, hairy, spiky - yet subtly and sublimely ordered.
    \ There are modern ways of capturing the essence of both concepts, but I don't
    think you've successfully struck on either in this design.\r\n\r\nI'll speak for
    myself as to the design's \"cheapness\": the use of the glow and glass effects
    is very Web 2.0, and the font choice is dull and not at all exciting.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    if you're going to exploit a lab concept, then you need to communicate the sense
    of awe and discovery that entails scientific research, not the necessity of sleeping
    on a cot in the lab because you need to monitor your experiment at 3:30am.  Your
    design is communicating more of the latter at this point.  Actually, it's communicating
    that your experiment has failed and the last three years of research is out the
    window and you will never get your PhD.\r\n\r\nThat is, of course, if you're really
    going for lab, and not organic after all...\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "This is the best I can do with the concept as originally presented in the
    limited time I have available for these things. The smaller type size has two
    effects; 1) adds dynamism and visual stimulation, 2) creates a sense of refinement
    and tasteful design.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marosi_outcome_3745.gif]\r\n\r\n\"Output\"
    is a bit obscure as to its implied meaning. Some potential customers will look
    at that word and wonder what's meant by it, causing a sense of doubt in their
    minds.\r\n\r\nFor a business logo it's important to be positive, leaving no room
    for doubt or indecision. Be optimistic and offer potential clients something they
    can relate to. The first question a business owner has on their mind when dealing
    with a design firm is, \"What are you going to do for me? How will your design
    services improve my business and make me more money?\"\r\n\r\nSo it helps to offer
    a benefit. The only suitable alternative word I came up with is \"Outcome\". In
    other words, there's something in it for the customer. An outcome. Some people
    may find that word inuendo-loaded tho, suggestive of sexual activity. It's nice
    and compact as words go, but I recommend finding a better alternative word beginning
    with 'O'.\r\n\r\nReplacement fonts used are Futura regular and some other sans
    with a double story a. Like it matters. Anything will do as long it's a reasonable
    match.\r\n\r\nMarosi, I recommend you take the objections people are making here
    to your use of glow and three dimensional effects with a grain of salt. They're
    being needlessly conservative and nitpicky for no good reason other than their
    personal prejudice against anything outside of dead flat graphic design. I mean
    really, guys. It's a matter of highbrow taste and the traditional hard-on most
    graphic designers seem to have for flat color treatments. It makes me laugh because
    that attitude is so snooty and elitist, and out of touch with reality. I wave
    my private parts in their general direction. \r\n\r\nI think your circular graphic
    element looks okay and you should go with what makes sense to you. It isn't \"bad\",
    nor is there anything inherently \"wrong\" with it. It is in fact quite creative,
    and progressive.\r\n\r\nBye.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "My initial thoughts are \"we do it as we want not as you want\" is the wrong
    approach ... or at least incorrect wording. So depending on how you're approaching
    it, a rethink might be in order. I believe \"Output\" might even miss the mark
    you're trying to convey ... to me it says \"we output stuff, we're your monkeys\"
    ... a repetitive/mechanical task, nothing about free thought or inspiring ideas.\r\n\r\nThe
    logo seems pretty generic in my opinion, and doesn't really express \"output\".
    I also tend to agree that the shiny look should be a treatment rather than the
    actual mark - i.e, any logo can have a web2.0 look applied ... but that's your
    decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul
