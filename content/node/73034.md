  different baselines and grids for a project and I read in one of typophile forums
  that a good baseline should be based on the font's x-height and not on its size
  in points. \r\n\r\nBy the way, can i get the x-height measure in points? is there
  any online converter for this?\r\n\r\nthanks for any info\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nSebs"

    many variables basing leading on some formula is a waste of time IMO. Trust your
    eyes! And, obviously, you need to read what you\u2019re setting. If the lines
    are too close, finding where you left off when you get to a new line might be
    hard. Does the ascenders and descenders touch? Does the page evoke the \u201Cfeel\u201D
    you\u2019re after? And so on \u2026"

    else then Lorem Ipsum when you need filler text.\r\nUse something you are actually
    interested in reading, this way you will \r\nbe reading a bigger portion of the
    text rather than just a couple\r\nof lines."

  body: "Back in the days of Postscript Type 1, a non-expert could look up values
    such as the x-height in the AFM, which was a simple text file. Of course, the
    usefulness of this depended upon that parameter having been correctly set in the
    font, which it often wasn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nNowadays, you\u2019d pretty much have
    to crack open the font to get this data. The conversion to points is just a matter
    of dividing the value by the em unit setting in the font (generally 1000 for CFF/OTF
    and 2048 for TTF/OTF) and then multiplying the resulting decimal by the point
    size. \r\n\r\nOr you could just measure the darn thing, as Frode suggests.\r\n\r\nBut
    I agree, using the x-height as a basis for determining your baseline grid seems
    to me to be full of potential to go horribly wrong, if you don\u2019t already
    have a good eye for this sort of thing."

  body: 'A simple way to determine the x-height - in InDesign: type a few x''s, separated
    by a return (so there are x''s on TWO lines. Give these a typesize as required
    and a Leading that is the same as the typesize. Zoom in as far as you can. Now
    lessen the Leading until the extremes of the x''s touch (you may have to use smaller
    units than full points). The x-height is the Typesize minus the value of the Leading.'
