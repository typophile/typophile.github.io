body: "Hey, all. So I'm finding that, for my current project in InDesign, I'm always
  having to adjust the \"Space After\" paragraph property manually. I'm working with
  a baseline grid of 4pt, so I want most paragraphs to have that 4pt (0.0554 in.)
  space after. The problem is that I'm working with mostly material that I didn't
  generate (it's an editing job), and even text that I import has that space at 0.0556
  inches. Because all my leadings are multiples of 8pt, the snap to baseline grid
  forces two 4pt spaces after paragraphs (I also have to change every instance of
  .00007 in to 0 in, for lists where I don't want spaces).\r\n\r\nSo I've found the
  Find/Replace feature useful for applying formatting such as text size, leading,
  and underline options with a broad brush, but for whatever reason, I can't get it
  to work for Space After. I set the \"Find Format\" box to the space after I don't
  want, the \"Change Format\" box to the space after I do want, and then when I click
  find, it tells me it can't find any instances.\r\n\r\nAnybody tell me what I'm doing
  wrong?\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    why you should use the paragraph styles. \r\nSet them up once, and you will have
    none of these problems. You can even map the paragraph styles in the original
    document to your styles when you place the document. "

    you're looking for, but it <em>is</em> the only answer that's correct.\r\n\r\nHere
    is why: the Find/Change format options are exact.  If you import text that is
    6.295pt, InDesign will round that off in the <em>displays</em> to 6.3pt.  But
    when searching for it in Find/Change, ID still treats it as 6.295pt, so it won't
