body: This is the cover of a book, circa 1960&#39;s by the then Sanche de Gramont,
  who is now Ted Morgan, author of &#39;Reds&#39;, histories of the American continental
  expansion, biographies of Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, more. Could this be Weiss
  Initials? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64641.jpg"

  body: If it was from the sixties, it&#39;s quite probable that it was done by hand.
    Notice how the top bar of the E and F are different. This doesn&#39;t necessarilly
    mean it&#39;s not a font, but if it is a font, I don&#39;t recognize it. &#40;Not
    Weiss Initials, either.&#41;

  body: Yes, not really Weiss style. You could be right about hand lettering. It&#39;s
    a sort of flare-serif hybrid.

  body: You get a similar feel with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/medium/testdrive.html?s=EPITAPH+FOR+KINGS&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Shango</a>. Different serifs but similar character shapes.
