  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I realize this isn&rsquo;t a type question, but I&rsquo;m guessing a scholar here will know:</p>
<p>I am curious about some prints from a book &ldquo;Masterpieces from the Art Galleries of the World&rdquo;.  Published by The NY Art Engraving Company.</p>
<p>They are prints made from engravings made from paintings in art galleries. I was wondering how they were made into such nice engravings. Was a photo made into an engraving, or did some talented person sketch them? Examples can be seen here:

<p>Although it is possible to create engravings in a photographic way I am guessing that these are the result of the engraver’s art. The link is to a partial essay on the subject.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some of them are hand done - but the majority on the website are photographic - by 1873 photolithography was invented and pushing wood engraving and steel engraving out- see Horgan&rsquo;s Half-Tone and Photomechanical Processes by Stephen H. Horgan, published by the Inland Printer Company in Chicago, 1913 for a complete account of some of the early techniques - some producing better images than we can today.</p>
<p>Some of the more linear ones could be wood engravings - but even they often put the artists sketch on the block photographically -</p>

<p>I wonder if this is the same type of process they call photolithography, used for making integrated circuits.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually I have an artist friend who made prints by having his drawings transfered photographically to printed circuit board blanks and then inked and printed them like a relief print (block print/letterpress). He also showed the boards themselves as works of art. Photolithography is the basis of most printing done today - all magazines, newspapers and books are printed that way. If you are interested in print media identification a contemporary book of interest is &ldquo;How to Identify Prints&rdquo; by Bamber Gascoigne, Thames &amp; Hudson, NY, 1988. It includes basic descriptions of the processes.</div>

<p>Yeah, about this time Kodak developed a pretty remarkable film. Allowed just about anyone anywhere to take a photo. &ldquo;Press the button and we do the rest.&rdquo; Photos could be made into engravings. Even more amazing. Fellow named Walker put this to good use in introducing the world to typefaces from the incunabula period (he actually went into libraries and photographed those old books). Wow. This inspired a fellow named Morris to engage in what was to become the typographic revival of the twentieth century. Amazingly, Jenson, Baskerville, Garamond, Manutius, etc., were discovered.</p>
<p>What the hell do they teach graphic designers in art school?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a pro designer, nor have I been to art school, but I imagine there are good teachers, and not-so-good teachers, but art school would be more fun than regular school.</p>
<p>Thanks for the type tie-in.</p>
