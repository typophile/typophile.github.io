  body: "Except that the theology is intricately connected with the typography.  I
    don't know which new testament interpretation you're using, but anything but the
    early 17th c. King James version written in blackletter just seems wrong and out
    of place to me.  Contemporary English in an antique typestyle seems self-contradictory.\r\n\r\nI
    was also briefly confused  by the initial blackletter glyph.  The verse number
    appeared as the letter 'g' rather than the number '9'. \r\n\r\n  Herb VB"

  body: "<ul>\r\n<li> As previously mentioned, blackletter only makes sense if you
    are attempting to reproduce some specific printing of the Bible.\r\n<li> Your
    use of a bold weight within the body of your text is distracting.  Italics are
    a less disruptive way of providing emphasis.  Similarly, SHOUTING is rude.\r\n<li>
    Small numbers should generally be written out; e.g., \"2\" in the first sentence
    should be \"two\".\r\n<li> Consider block indenting long quotes.\r\n<li>Your double
    quotes are a mix of straight quotes and curly (\"typographer's\") quotes.  You
    should choose one convention and stick with it; typographer's quotes lead to better
    looking spacing.\r\n<li>Your measure is much too long.  You can fix this by increasing
    your left/right margins, and increasing the size of your type.\r\n<li>Your top/bottom
    margins seem very narrow.  Play with them in order to choose a reasonable aspect
    ratio for your page space.\r\n<li>The absence of hyphenation (and center justification)
    leads to very uneven spacing between words, which is disruptive.\r\n<li>Try decreasing
    your inter-paragraph space and indenting your paragraphs; it would tend to flow
    better. \r\n<li>Your ordinal indicators could be written as superscripts.\r\n<li>Play
    with your leading; it seems a bit large with your main body typeface (though not
    in the blackletter portions...)\r\n<li>The center/bold section headings are rather
    typewriter-y.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThese are just very quick comments. Many of the
    things that I've commented on look like default settings rather than deliberate
    choices on your part; if this is so, you may want to consider going through a
    couple of books on typography and print design.  I've found <cite>The Elements
    of Typographic Style</cite> by Robert Bringhurst an excellent and accessible introduction
    to typography in general, and <cite>Book Typography: A Designer's Manual</cite>
    by Michael Mitchell and Susan Wightman to be an excellent introduction to book
    design."

  body: "The above opinions are solid, but mainstream. Specifically:\r\n- Blackletter
    <em>can</em> make sense beyond mere historicism - it has a flavor and relevance
    all its own. That said, it certainly is difficult finding a blackletter than can
    work in a sophisticated way.\r\n- Although Bold is indeed almost always too disruptive,
    do consider using a Demi for emphasis (if available). To me that's even more elegant
    and functional than using Italics.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Try something other than Times for your body text. A classic serifed font
    should work well. Perhaps then you can set the biblical extracts in a compatible
    sans serif \u2014 or vice versa.\r\n\r\nI do think the blackletter is too disruptive
    and unreadable. I might simply use italics, or a second color. If you must use
    blackletter, though, why not find one that's more open and readable, like Clairvaux?
    Or simply set the titles (\"Acts 1:9\u201311\") in blackletter, and leave the
    text in roman? Or just use a blackletter drop cap or something?\r\n\r\nI recommend
    old-style (\"lowercase\") numerals, and en dashes as opposed to hyphens in verse
    numbers. You use them sometimes, but not always.\r\n\r\nYou do not need quote
    marks around the biblical passages; a change of font (and, probably indent) is
    enough.\r\n\r\nI would set the verse numbers in the text in a different color
    (red) or in light grey.\r\n\r\nIf you set the extracts narrower, with a large
    right margin, and the commentary narrower, with a large left margin, or some such
    arrangement, you could make an interesting visual alternation between text and
    commentary, while suggesting two columns or trains of thought.\r\n\r\nThe main
    thing, though, is to find an alternative to the blackletter you're using.\r\n\r\nSuper
    quick sample of a different approach, just to give you some things to think about:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5452.png]"

    if even that's too much, maybe something gently evocative of blackletter, like
    Bremer Antiqua* or at least Emerson (the latter showing the hand of the punchcutter
    of the former, even though Blumenthal wouldn't explicitly admit it).\r\n\r\n*

  body: I just uploaded a new version....I still want the bold type for emphasis.....Ed
    Stevens, the leading world authority on the topic of the essay, uses that technique
    and he recommended it to me. The topic of the essay is very "revolutionary" and
    sometimes in a "revolution" shouting is needed. ;) ;) The essay is trying to change
    well ingrained old concepts of the reader, so great emphasis is needed in certain
    key phrases etc.

  body: "The new version is a huge improvement. Well done.\r\n\r\nI still would like
    to see oldstyle figures for verse numbers (which Times New Roman actually does
    have, in some versions), or at least reduced size lining figures.\r\n\r\nThe italic
    is much more readable than the blackletter, and the two-column setting helps.\r\n\r\nSome
    of your quotes are still straight.\r\n\r\nYou might try reducing your type size
    by one or two points, but keeping the leading the same. I think that will greatly
    help your readability overall \u2014 smaller type, more space between the lines.
    This is generally easier to reads than large type, tightly spaced."

  body: "The bold type is a very bad idea: it fragments the text and actually reduces
    the readability of the document. As soon as one engages with the page, one's eye
    is drawn to these passages, but they don't make sense without the connecting text.
    This is lousy text articulation, and there is good reason why, in +550 years,
    this has never become one of the norms of typography.\r\n\r\nAs for reflecting
    a 'revolutionary' content of the theology... well, no, it just makes you look
    like a typographical crank, the documentary equivalent of someone ranting on a
    street corner. Theological arguments must hold their own in the norms of reasoned
    discourse, and dressing them up with idiosyncratic emphasis is likely to make
    readers question that ability."
