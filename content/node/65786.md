body: "Hello fellow typophiles, \r\n\r\nI've been working on a typeface that I painted
  on paper and as I kept on working on it it never occured to me that I will be needing
  to ever convert it to a digital format. As I was finishing it up I thought it would
  be a good excersice and practice if I created an real working font out of it. So
  I embarked on a journey to convert it to the digital format. \r\n\r\nI've never
  had any prior engagement with Fontlab Studio, so I knew it'll be an uphill struggle,
  but nothing like this. I'll show you what i mean: \r\n\r\nThis is the E in my typeface.
  \r\n\r\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/739/picture34.gif\r\n\r\nI scanned it,
  opened it in Illustrator and traced it. Selected the whole shape and then copied
  it into clipboard to paste it into Fontlab Studio. The problem is, when I do that,
  this is what I get in Fontlab Studio: \r\n\r\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/41/picture35.gif\r\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/9104/picture36.gif\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy
  does it look like this in Fontlab Studio? Is it due to too many points and marks
  in typeface that when converted create these lines? Because I thought the shapes
  once they are in illustrator should copy perfectly to FLS. \r\n\r\nAny help would
  be appreciated. Thanks a lot and happy new year! \r\n\r\nNamhar"

  body: Too many points - I pasted your E into Fontographer and auto traced it and
    got over 7000 points - I have found that even 2500 points are hard to deal with.
    Start with something simpler and maybe use TypeTool of Fontographer to start as
    they have an easier learning curve.

    put in FLS I get a black square with the outline of the letter in it. FLS is the
    only package I have access to at the moment unfortunately. \r\n\r\nhttp://img192.imageshack.us/img192/1950/picture37.gif"

    It happened with my first font.\r\nSelect the vector in Illustrator and use \"Live
    Paint\" > \"Make\" and then transfer to FontLab. That should do the trick."

  body: Sorry, I forgot to mention that for my particular case I needed to use the
    "Direct Selection Tool" instead of just the regular "Selection Tool" to remove
    the unnecessary borders left by "Live Paint" and for correct copying into FontLab.

  body: "Wow! Good on you!\r\nI really like the distressed effect and with some more
    of the splatter effect it will only get better. For these type of fonts the original
    artwork is always the best benchmark; get the typeface to look as close as it
    can to the artwork."
