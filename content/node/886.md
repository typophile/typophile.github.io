    <BR>&#34;All cruel people describe themselves as paragons of frankness.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t mean to label you with this quote, but do I use it to make clear
    that candor is not the only virtue. In any case, it is perfectly possible to be
    candid about typography etc without being candid about what a knave or fool you
    think the other person is. What positive purpose is served by name calling? <BR>

    try to correct myself &#40;assuming I even realize it&#41;. Usually when I &#34;offend&#34;
    it&#39;s simply because the other party doesn&#39;t like hearing the truth, even
    if it can only ever be a truth for a few other people. That&#39;s <i>their</i>
    failing. <BR> <BR>Candor is indeed not the only virtue, but I feel it&#39;s more
    important than tact, or even token respect. <BR> <BR>If you care about something,
    you&#39;ll be candid about it. If you have an acquaintance with a nose the size
    of an elephant&#39;s trunk, and you notice that it&#39;s preventing the person
    from getting a date, you&#39;d be helping everybody by suggesting he consider
    getting a nose job. If the person is too insecure to handle a mere suggestion,
    that&#39;s not your fault - you did the right thing. <BR> <BR>&#62; What positive
    purpose is served by name calling? <BR> <BR>If you mean what I&#39;m thinking,
    almost nothing. Calling somebody a &#34;jackass&#34; for example has no constructive
    value &#40;except hopefully to trigger a fruitful opposing reaction - sometimes
    things have to hit bottom to bounce back&#41;, less because it&#39;s name-calling
    and more because it simply can&#39;t physically be true! But that sort of thing
    is pretty rare here. <BR> <BR>But when &#40;on another list&#41; I say something
    like &#34;Mr X is so blinded by calligraphy that he has trouble avoiding psychological
    lethargy in type design&#34;, and a certain person thinks this is grounds for
    expelling me from the list &#40;even though Mr X is not even a listmember!&#41;,
    then that person is an <i>intolerant</i>, and will never be at harmony in a multicultural
    milieu, unless he/she changes <i>inside</i>, as opposed to changing other people&#39;s
    superficial behavior. <BR> <BR>This is what we&#39;re really dealing with: <BR>Insecurities
    turning into livid reactions, not merely feeling insulted at name-calling. <BR>

    my point! Assuming your opinion is opposed to somebody else&#39;s &#40;happily
    a very common thing!&#41; then you simply can&#39;t be maximally understood and
    totally &#34;polite&#34; at the same time. You can only be polite to the extent

  body: Hrant, who would have known you would have been getting free therapy here?
    Progress, progress, progress. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll admit, I have not been around
    here forever. But I do regularly read, if I do not participate, in many of the
    posts around here however. I do not read every one I admit. It would take to much
    time and I must make a living. <BR> <BR>I do however, perhaps more than anyone
    else&#39;s, follow  Hrant&#39;s posts. I find the discussions he participates
    in to be, more often than not, learning experiences. For that I am grateful. And
    for the most part &#40;I&#39;ve been around about a year now I think&#41;  I have
    not seen Hrant attack anyone who did not deserve it.  <BR> <BR>In fact, many times,
    it seems as if a few have logged on for the purpose of attacking him. <BR> <BR>I
    feel that if anyone has been inappropriate around here, in proportion to the total
    number of times they have posted, it would be &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;
    &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;.  <BR> <BR>Well, Hrant, I would think that
    enough of the people around here would indeed know you well enough &#40; even
    on a forum &#41; not to be so offended by some of the things you say. It seems,
    according to your accusers, that you say these things often enough that they would
    carry little weight by now. But obviously you are respected. Not matter how many
    times you post <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I for one, think it is wonderful, that you put with all of
    this, and still you are willing to share what you know about type. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: 'I&#39;ve applied my own rigorous 72 hour rule for this <BR>reply. If you
    read any of this at all, please read the <BR>whole thing so I&#39;m not misunderstood.
    <BR> <BR>I hope I can say this once and get it off my chest <BR>forever. More
    than that I hope Hrant doesn&#39;t respond. <BR>I&#39;ve written drafts of this
    letter many times over the <BR>span of my involvement here; some for Hrant in
    private, <BR>some for the public. Most sat forever, unposted. One or <BR>two got
    sent to him privately as formal censures, but <BR>wait; Jared got to write those.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve never commented publicly, mainly because I didn&#39;t <BR>think
    Hrant would take it as helpful criticism and also <BR>because I thought posting
    it online would be <BR>inappropriate. <BR> <BR>In some ways I&#39;m posting this
    in hopes we can move on. <BR>In other ways, I&#39;m really hoping Hrant is listening
    for <BR>his sake and ours &#40;so he can help us move on&#41;. I&#39;m also <BR>tempted
    to link to two-year old posts so some of you <BR>new folks can see what all the
    fuss is about, and that <BR>Hrant has come a long way, but the archives have saved
    <BR>me the effort and spared us all the past. A past that <BR>hopefully we can
    all laugh about later. <BR> <BR>Lastly, I won&#39;t speak as a moderator/partner
    here. It&#39;s <BR>just me. Hrant hasn&#39;t asked for this thread, nor does <BR>he
    deserve more air time &#40;or scolding for that matter&#41;, <BR>but in so many
    ways he has been asking for it for a <BR>very long time and rightfully deserves
    a lengthy public <BR>scolding in the form of a roast from someone who likes <BR>to
    think he cares. <BR> <BR>I could just second most of what Jon Coltz and all of
    <BR>what John Hudson wrote and sit down. I could just agree <BR>with anonymous,
    that Hrant is a tedious, insufferable <BR>bigot. I do think I have a different
    perspective to <BR>offer and hopefully it can be taken constructively by <BR>Hrant
    and his detractors. &#40;Besides, John&#39;s British <BR>roots betrayed him; he
    was way too polite for Hrant to <BR>actually see the critique. =&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    be as blunt as Hrant seems to prefer and I&#39;m going <BR>to try to be candid
    and also fair. Hrant needs to <BR>change, frankly in ways I&#39;m skeptical are
    possible. The <BR>Type community, including myself, needs to change: to <BR>consider
    Hrant for what he is now, and move on. The <BR>only caveat is, I&#39;ve never
    met him. I don&#39;t read every <BR>single post here &#40;or elsewhere&#41; so
    I don&#39;t consider <BR>myself privy to everything he says or did in his past
    <BR>life. <BR> <BR>On to the letter. <BR> <BR>_________________________ <BR> <BR>Jon,
    <BR> <BR>In some ways I agree. In other ways Hrant angers me <BR>beyond words.
    Thanks for giving me a platform for my <BR>vent and call to action. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    heard too many people, whom I respect and whose <BR>experience I would love to
    hear from more, say he&#39;s the <BR>reason they don&#39;t post more. That&#39;s
    a shame. <BR> <BR>But I believe he&#39;s becoming sufficiently &#42;ignorable
    for <BR>those who find him insufferable. &#40;I&#39;ll elaborate <BR>later.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Like Yves, I too believe Hrant&#39;s not a bad guy, I know <BR>he&#39;s
    had a legal run-in with a major foundry in the <BR>past which, to my 3rd-hand
    knowledge is resolved and <BR>forgiven by all parties &#40;if I&#39;m wrong someone
    will <BR>correct me within the hour&#41; and is deeper than being <BR>removed
    from any online discussion, but not so deep <BR>that the type community should
    hang him out to dry. I <BR>don&#39;t fully know the details, nor should we care,
    <BR>unless they are pertinent or threatening or affect us <BR>personally. I even
    believe, if one are sincere and <BR>Hrant sensed that sincerity, he&#39;d probably
    tell about <BR>it. Finally, from what I can tell, Hrant never holds a <BR>grudge.
    Okay, so I shouldn&#39;t say never, but at least <BR>when he holds a grudge you&#39;ll
    know about it. For these <BR>reasons I no longer question his motives, only his
    <BR>approach. <BR> <BR><b>That&#39;s the past baggage,</b> that&#39;s Hrant pre
    2001-2002 <BR>&#40;I sincerely hope&#41;. Let&#39;s move on already and hope <BR>Hrant
    can help us tolerate him more with my <BR>Simple-Action Reckoning and Carefree
    Approach to <BR>Symbiosis Method outlined below. <BR> <BR><b>On to the present
    baggage.</b> Yes, this is for those <BR>of you intolerant of hhp. He&#39;s become
    more ignorable in <BR>the past year. He&#39;s more willing to admit wrong or <BR>listen
    to another view. Sometimes, though, when I can&#39;t <BR>bear it, I still have
    to post <i>around</i> Hrant by <BR>picking up a thread at a point before he got
    to it. For <BR>the most part this works, but honestly, Hrant is a <BR>better man
    than some of you grudgingly hold. Even <BR>though he&#39;s still an insufferable
    tedious bigot. <BR> <BR><b>Mr. Papazian&#39;s online wanderings would be more
    <BR>fruitful to him and others if he found better focus.</b> <BR>Were his postings
    more targeted and less haphazard he <BR>could focus on mutual understanding and
    less time <BR>responding to every thread, everywhere. &#40;Does Hrant go <BR>home
    at night and check off a list off all the <BR>perceived wrongs he righted?&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Seriously, Hrant should use his online time &#40;is he ever <BR>off-line?&#41;
    to pick a few key discussions and really <BR>explore them, rather than his current
    method of reading <BR>every thread and taking a shotgun-blast approach to <BR>leaving
    quick comments in each one. When Hrant agrees <BR>with a thread, these quick comments
    are cheapened by <BR>their quantity like showering too many compliments. <BR>However,
    when he disagrees, these quick comments come <BR>off as blanket statements wherein
    he endicts entire <BR>industries, classes of people, organizations and entire
    <BR>nations. They are antagonizing and, by their quick <BR>nature, unproductive
    and take away from the times when <BR>he&#39;s caught being helpful or kind. <BR>
    <BR><b>Hrant has to help us like him better.</b> In your <BR>letter Jon, you assert
    that others don&#39;t post because <BR>they&#39;re afraid. That may be so, for
    a minority. Most <BR>just see that it&#39;s fruitless to engage in a <BR>conversation
    with someone who just wants to antagonize; <BR>someone who just argues, and seemingly
    not for the sake <BR>of disagreement, but for the savor of being <BR>disagreeable.
    If that keeps someone with real-world <BR>experience -- as opposed to being well
    read or even the <BR>most verbose -- away from online forums, that&#39;s a <BR>shame.
    &#40;Unfortunately the &#39;fruitful avoidance&#39; thing <BR>only seems to work
    in hallways and lecture halls.&#41; <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t the 4th grade where
    we get an S if we play <BR>nicely or a U if we don&#39;t. Unfortunately, in the
    past, <BR>Hrant has given people plenty of reasons to not like <BR>him. Some people
    just want more reasons to like Hrant. <BR>Some of these will never be satisfied
    and that&#39;s okay, <BR>and it&#39;s probably okay with Hrant too. Afterall,
    he&#39;s <BR>never sought anybody&#39;s approval. <BR> <BR>I already responded
    to Hrant&#39;s comment about tolerance. <BR>I&#39;ll elaborate since it suits
    the structure of my <BR>letter. On August 11, 9:25am, he wrote: <BR> <BR><i>We
    come from different environments, and <BR>naturally civility has different measures
    for you and <BR>me... The only thing you should try to enforce is <BR>tolerance...
    It really is a matter of spine, which <BR>translates to self-control. </i> <BR>
    <BR>Even though Hrant can be insulting, he may be the most <BR>tolerant of us
    as people. Afterall, he chooses to live <BR>in America, a land he loathes, among
    mostly Christians <BR>who he deems worse than nazis, in LA of all places, the
    <BR>ideological capital of all things decadent, fat and <BR>SUV-driving. Phew,
    now that&#39;s tolerant! <BR> <BR>He&#39;s certainly not the most tolerant of
    ideas, however. <BR>His tolerance argument sounds good if it&#39;s coming from
    <BR>Mr. Bowfry &#40;ahem, back in the 4th grade&#41;. If Hrant were <BR>the picked-on
    kid who was always nice, but still had no <BR>friends, we&#39;d be inclined to
    agree with his view of <BR>tolerance and have empathy. Or at least, he&#39;d be
    a <BR>chick magnet with the 6th grade girls.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if
    I should congratulate Hrant on growing <BR>a stiff spine or if I should challenge
    him to now grow <BR>some manners &#40;&#39;Western&#39; or what he calls&#39;traditional&#39;
    <BR>I&#39;d take either one. He is essentially saying, &#34;if you <BR>can&#39;t
    tolerate my abrasiveness, then you&#39;re intolerant, <BR>and that&#39;s your
    fault, not mine.&#34; That&#39;s Hrant&#39;s excuse <BR>for not taking the time
    or effort to articulate what <BR>he&#39;s thinking. Honesty doesn&#39;t have to
    be rude and <BR>blunt is not the same as brash. If Hrant were really <BR>trying
    to have a conversation or productive dialogue <BR>he&#39;d strive to communicate
    and be understood rather <BR>than aiming to offend. <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;ll try
    to tone down my digs -- some friendly, all <BR>critical. Truthfully, when he takes
    the effort to stay <BR>through an argument, the harsh points, the brazen <BR>attitude
    and caustic shards are broken off in the <BR>tussle and the result is a mishappen
    but recognizalbe <BR>nugget that many seem to agree on. The journey is <BR>sometimes
    longer than its worth, but once tested, there <BR>is a semi-rational person behind
    the hhp signature. <BR>&#40;Okay, despite my own social/political/religious and
    <BR>sometimes typographic views.&#41; <BR> <BR>In conclusion, here&#39;s my four
    step <b>Simple-Action Reckoning and <BR>Carefree Approach to Symbiosis Method</b>
    or <BR><b>S.A.R.C.A.S.M.</b>: &#40;Hrant, this is the part you can <BR>easily
    copy and paste into your reply.&#41; <BR> <BR><b>1&#41;</b> Limit your posts to
    one or two threads on one or two <BR>forums per week. Oh, and take a weekend off
    every once <BR>in a while. Doing this will help you be more focused, <BR>more
    meaningful, more understood and those who can&#39;t <BR>stand you will have less
    of you to &#39;tolerate.&#39; Oh, plus <BR>it will help us all keep up. <BR> <BR><b>2&#41;</b>
    Offer your strongest opinions when you have have <BR>some expertise or real experience,
    not just because you <BR>have a strong opinion. &#40;We&#39;re all entitled to
    our <BR>opinions, but we&#39;re not all prepared to hear the all <BR>the uninformed
    ones all the time. This is why I&#39;m <BR>silent a lot. It helps me stay mysterious
    and looking <BR>smarter than I am. Why do you think Jared is quieter <BR>than
    me? You probably also thought he was smarter than <BR>me. =&#41; <BR> <BR><b>3&#41;</b>
    When you don&#39;t have an interest/expertise in a topic <BR>try listening. &#40;I
    remember when you once held the <BR>opinion that letterpress was a useless exercise
    in <BR>nostalgia. Now that you&#39;ve taken a class in it you&#39;ve <BR>developed
    a new opinion and I&#39;ve enjoyed listening to <BR>you talk about it. &#40;And
    Geralds, I haven&#39;t pushed any <BR>ems, if letterpress is the only measure
    we&#39;re using <BR>here, I guess I&#39;m out.&#41; <BR> <BR>Finally, the failsafe
    in the Simple-Action Reckoning <BR>and Carefree Approach to Symbiosis Method is:
    <BR> <BR><b>4&#41;</b> If none of these works, start a blog at your own <BR>domain

    in a topic try listening. &#40;I remember when you once held the opinion that
    letterpress was a useless exercise in nostalgia. Now that you&#39;ve taken a class
    in it you&#39;ve developed a new opinion and I&#39;ve enjoyed listening to you
    talk about it. &#40;And Geralds, I haven&#39;t pushed any ems, if letterpress
    is the only measure we&#39;re using here, I guess I&#39;m out.&#41; <BR>......
    <BR> <BR>I am not one wishing to dampen enthusiasm about letterpress including
    Hrants, but the point is more than quantity of ems per hour. But of expertise.
    My serious qualifications as a punchcutter, typefounder grant me a greater credibility
    of how type is made. Would you not think that could be true? My observations about
    Pascal has nothing to do with nostalgia. That is what I was accused of, not knowing
    what I was talking about, and nostalgia apparently negated any knowledge that
    I may have accumulated. I think not. <BR> <BR>Together Hrant and Gerald Lange
    intended to insult me in public and I take it as such. <BR> <BR>Also, I did not
    say that Gerald Lange did bad work. If I thought so, certainly that was my opportunity.
    My opinion is the very opposite.  <BR> <BR>But as far as, &#34;not doing bad work&#34;,
    neither do I. <BR> <BR>Maybe I should have made myself more clear. <BR> <BR><a

    prescribed in Sokrates&#39; sentence because of his involvement with the 30 Tyrants,
    who <i>had</i> used that form of execution. In other words, the method of execution
    tells us something about the political reasons for Sokrates&#39; trial. Not only
