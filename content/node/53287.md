    Black is the font that I chose to represent Martin Luther King Jr.  I felt the
    characteristics of the font displayed King's attributes well; for example, King
    was a bold individual and when he spoke he was assertive and stood strong as a
    leader.  Arial Black is a strong, bold typeface that gives me a sense of assertiveness
    and communicates an intensity like King communicated people's rights.  "
