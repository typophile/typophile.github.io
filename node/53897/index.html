This picture is my all time favorite. I like the angle of this picture as well as the sign. I saw a bunch of these stacked vertical signs during my trip downtown, but this one was my favorite. Bars are definitely something most people associate to New Orleans. I like how beautiful this sign is even when it's not lit up, but because it's so pretty, it makes you want to see it working again. Remnants of the past, I suppose. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obama_6151.jpg]
I'm not sure if most people would consider this a sign, but I did. Someone has been posting these Obama posters all over the city. I posted this one because I thought it was pretty funny. I'm a big fan of handwritten text, especially when it looks like my own handwriting.

I almost missed this wall because the paint is so faded, but I'm glad I didn't because I think this is an awesome find. I am constantly on and around this street (I'm almost certain its Royal) and I have never seen this wall before. I can't make out all the words but I know it says "PRINTING" and "LETTER" and maybe once was a printing shop or something. But I love how New Orleans as well as myself has this appreciation for the old, and I hope things like this don't get covered up because this is what I feel like makes New Orleans, New Orleans.

Nothing says New Orleans like the tiled street names on the ground. I took quite a few since they are at almost every corner in the quarter, but I liked this one the best because it looked really old and is in a recognizable place.

I took this picture including the "Do Not Enter" sign because growing up, my mom would always warn me not to go in there EVER especially at night because I without a doubt was going to get raped, mugged, and killed. It's safe to say, I've never been to Armstrong park, but it does have a really awesome sign. Each letter is lined with lights so at night it's quite a sight.

I have more I'd like to post, or link to another page, but I'm already late for work so I'll try to do that later tonight.</div>
