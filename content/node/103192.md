  body: hm. downloaded one of their catalogs and the font list in the pdf includes
    "createdferodoicons".  don't have the pro version of acrobat w/pitstop here to
    see exactly where it's used, but might be a custom job.

  body: "Note that in the original metal, Neuland's sizes were each very different
    (because Koch cut them by hand/eye). It's possible this was taken from a particular
    size that hasn't been digitized.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Jaspert's Type Encyclopedia explains the process:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeulandInfo__5996.jpg]\r\nThe
    logo seems bolded, even when one considers the variation in the original. Here
    is one size from 1923--I am using a fairly large scale image so the details are
    clear:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeulandI@40percent_6731.jpg]\r\nLove
    the font. Endlessly abused for variations that Koch would find silly, but the
    originals remain fresh to the modern eye.\r\nDon"
