  school version, I assume it was MM Paris and very custom. \r\nThis is not really
  an ID post, I would love to know anyone had any similar points of reference of this
  that I could research further ?\r\nthanks \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    discussion]] on this topic, 2 people suggested a loosely similar may be achieved
    by reworking either Kepler or Utopia.\r\nSome I like, not saying thy're in the
    same vein though: [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/classiccaps.php|Classic

  body: "IMHO these letters, whether or not made into a formal font are made by compressing
    the top 2/3 of a font vertically and stretching the bottom 1/3 vertically -- not
    necessarily to the same degree or  using the same method. Consider Kuzanyan [img:sites/default/files/old-images/KuzanyanInUseAsPUR_5001.gif]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/kuzanyan/\r\nSome
    further torturing of the letterforms produce a match.\r\nTry it yourself.\r\nThere
    are probably other fonts that would work better as a starting point. Kepler and
    Utopia are not quite as close as Kuzanyan. Other candidates?\r\nDon"
