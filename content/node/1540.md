  body: I think like everyone else I started out liking Verdana at 10px. Then like
    everyone else again, I became quite partial to Georgia with its cute numerals.
    And yes, I&#39;ve been through a Trebuchet phase as well. I like those little
    bends as well. <BR> <BR>There are only so many screen fonts to choose from, you&#39;re
    bound to end up trying them all. Or most. <BR> <BR>I wish they would come up with
    more screen fonts.

  body: IMHO Verdana 11px is the best screen font that&#39;s readable without looking
    clunky. Verdana 13px has a slightly more open spacing than 12px. If you want to
    use 12px, Verdana Bold is better looking. <BR> <BR>But you know what, I still
    think Geneva 12px is really the best... with Chicago 12px as its bold. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t really care for serifs for screen use, but New York is probably the
    most readable. Gergia at 12px is a bit too tight. <BR> <BR>And of course Underware&#39;s
    Unibody, at 8px! Especially the upright italic! <BR> <BR>The Quartz business in
    OS X is driving my nuts. If you don&#39;t anti-aliase &#40;everything above 12
    gets anti-aliased anyway&#41;, the spacing is all screwed up. Do you know of any
    shareware extensions that would correct this? <BR> <BR>

  body: You know on the Mac, I like to define verdana at 10.5px. I think it&#39;s
    the perfect size. Unfortunately, on a PC, it becomes 11px which  is too big for
    me. <BR> <BR>And yes unibody is oh-so-sweet. And it&#39;s so nice of them to give
    it away.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know what you mean by the Quartz business but the
    anti-aliasing <i>is</i> driving me LOONY. Everything is so fuzzy wuzzy. And that
    is the least of the OSX suite of problems. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t find anything.
    There is no manual. And I as if my dear old Mac has been possessed by a PC! I&#39;m
    so lost, I think I&#39;ll be sticking to the classic mode for as long as I can.

  body: '&#62; How do you render half a pixel? <BR> <BR>1&#41; In grayscale rendering
    you have fractional pixels. <BR>2&#41; In Windows the native OS resolution is
    96 ppi, so some half-pixel sizes will have their own bitmaps. Specifically, 10
    point rounds to 13 PPEM, 11 point to 15 PPEM, and 10.5 point to 14 PPEM. Since
    96/72 is 4/3, one out of every three half-pixel sizes will have its own bitmap.  <BR>

  body: ah...but we&#39;re not talking about points at all...just pixels.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    confused as to how a font spec&#39;ed at 10.5 would render since the pixel is
    pretty much the smallest unit available on the screen &#40;with the noted exception
    of sub-pixel rendering things like clear-type which aren&#39;t really applicable
    in this case&#41;

  body: I prefer Trebuchet at 10 points &#40;Strangely in the windows appearances
    window, the same size is listed as 8&#41; and Georgia at 10.  Both at the 96 dpi
    default of windows, and both with cleartype on.

  body: Hrant - in what I assume was a slip, you wrote that PPEM is &#34;points per
    em&#34;, which makes no sense because a 14 point font will always be 14 points
    per em, by definition. Of course ppem = pixels per em. TrueType font technicians
    use this pixel measurement all the time, and don&#39;t think in real-world units
    such as points or millimetres. When an application requests a particular point
    size &#40;and implicitly also a zoom &amp; resolution specification&#41;, the
    font returned is mapped to the closest ppem size. <BR> <BR>If you want to examine
    the actual pixel-tuned ppem sizes in fonts, a nice trick in MS Word is to set
    the zoom to 75%. Since 72 is 75% of 96, the point size setting will now exactly
    equal the ppem setting. Set some lines in consecutive point sizes, and you&#39;ll
    see how the font behaves at all low resolutions. Use Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-] to whizz
    up &amp; down sizes in selected text.
