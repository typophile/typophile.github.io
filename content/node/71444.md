  body: "Copyright.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Worshipful Company of Stationers in the
    UK was a Royal body that exercised a monopoly over publishing in the UK from before
    the invention of moveable type until 1709, in practice until the 19th century
    in England, restricting the number of printers and what might be printed. The
    powers that be recognized the revolutionary power of the printed word. This made
    for a dismal, stagnant print culture in the UK, and prior to Caslon, the best
    types in the UK came from Holland. Caslon made his name making scholarly scripts,
    not the Latin alphabet. \r\n\r\nThe transitional style of typography emerged in
    Scotland (Baskerville came later), at the Foulis Press, because Scotland put into
    effect the 1709 repeal of the Company of Stationers' monopoly before the English
    did, thereby developing a thriving and dynamic publishing industry in the mid
    18th century.\r\n\r\nConcerning writing, in the early 19th century the practice
    of reading was spreading throughout the UK population, but books were still relatively
    expensive, so many people hand-copied popular novels &c., and circulated them
    amongst friends."

    Bright concluded in his critique of the book at the 1988 Unicode conference keynote:
    <em>\u2018Any writing that purports to be non-fiction \u2013 whether scholarly
    books, technical reports, journalism, or business documents \u2013 is supposed
    to meet a basic criterion: You're not allowed to just MAKE IT UP. Shlain's work
    fails to meet this criterion.\u2019</em>\r\n\r\nBright's full paper is available

  body: "Shlain's alphabet/goddess book\r\n\r\nI wouldn't call it a travesty. He presents
    his thesis: that the introduction of alphabetic literacy causes a temporary cultural
    emphasis towards left brain thinking. He backs it up with historical observation.
    The author does not present himself as an expert in the field, but as an amateur
    philosopher, who has glimpsed a pattern and through the research for the book,
    has tried to see where his insight leads him. The book is not a scientific work,
    nor is it presented as such."

  body: Historical observation is limited by the readers experience. There are, undoubtedly,
    different sets of observations in written history and probably countless more
    which never were written down or survived until today to be read.

    these types look sufficiently transitional.\r\nIn particular the serifs on C and

    Baskerville cut his faces?\r\nCertainly, they were both handy enough.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAlso
    to consider: the abolition of various publishing taxes (stamp and paper) in England
    in the 1830s.\r\nThis reduced the selling price of books, and especially newspapers
    and magazines, boosting circulation and stimulating these as vehicles for the
    advertising of products such as books, as consumer items. The new magazines were
    breeding grounds for authors such as Dickens and Thackeray.\r\nHere is an example
    of the old and new. On the right is an ad espousing tastefully classic upscale
    understatement on thick, handmade paper; on the left, the new jazzy commercial
    style of mixing wildly disparate fonts, informed by posters. So this is the market
    for the new Figgins sans, and how it was used.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bentley_5401.png]"
