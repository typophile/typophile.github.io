body: "I never finished any fonts until recently and so I never got to the stage of
  designing numbers before. While completing all the numeral sets I came to realize
  that the fractals require their very own set which is distinct from superscript/subscript.
  I guess I should have realized, and yet I was surprised at the amount of work required
  to complete all numeral sets.\r\n\r\nI just saw the development of Lewis, a mathematical
  typeface from the TypeMedia 2014 course (http://typemedia2014.com/lewis) and saw
  how the designer was working with scripts and software I'm not familiar with to
  aid him in the design process. One image shows a number for some kind of script
  style which is scaled by the typesetting system. This got me wondering if it's at
  all possible to use software to aid you in designing different numeral sets. Not
  just scaling, but also optical adjustments.\r\n\r\nSo now the first question I have
  is what kind of software you use to aid you in your design process. What kind of
  tools could I be using to speed up some parts of my design process and possibly
  get more consistent results? I don't know how one usually goes about designing numerals,
  but I first designed the lining figures and derived the other numeral sets from
  it. For the sup/sub and fractions I scaled the lining figures down and adjusted
  the numerals manually.\r\n\r\nSo then my second question is, how do you go about
  designing numerals anyway? Perhaps it's a lack of experience from my part, but I
  find them hard and tedious to do. Sometimes I wish I could focus solely on the letters
  and forget about all the other glyphs."

    to speed up the process and possibly get more consistent results?

    now, preferring to cannibalize my previous work via various tools\u2014transformations
    and cut-and-paste.\r\n\r\nI assume that every \u201Cbezier-wrangler\u201D develops
    their own idiosyncratic technique of making glyph outlines.\r\n\r\nThese days
    I do the lining tabular \uFB01gures \uFB01rst, then the rest."
