  body: ' This is really a nice typeface.  the one thing i did notice is that towards
    the end of the alphabet, the faces seem to get more &#39;curvy&#39;, or they don&#39;t
    seem to be as fluid as the front half  of the alphabet.  Like in the W or X...
    there seems to be more curves in it than any other letters, ...or maybe this was
    more obvious on these two than the rest. <BR> <BR>still, nice work! '
