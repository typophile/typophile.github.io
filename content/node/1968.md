body: This is an annoying question that was probably asked and answered somewhere
  here before. <BR> <BR>Why doesn&#39;t Illustrator read the kerning of the font I
  just made, but Quark does? <BR> <BR>How do I make this font look kerned in Illustrator/Photoshop.
  Is this even possible, cos the font I just made is not a monotype font. <BR> <BR>In
  Fontographer, I hand-kerned the special pairs I needed and did the Auto-Kern/Auoto-Space.
  I saved the file, tested the TrueType font in Illustrator and it&#39;s like I did
  nothing. In Quark, the kerning shows up. I&#39;m using OS 9.1, Illustrator 9, Fontographer
  4.1.5, and ATM <BR> <BR>Thanks for all your help. <BR>

  body: L Todd, The Illustrator CS version should take care of that because Adobe
    claims they made the type &amp; color engines  of Illustrator, InDesign and PhotoShop
    the same. I haven&#39;t gotten Illustrator CS yet any day now. Maybe Thomas can
    chime in since he&#39;s our resident Adobe expert. Dan

  body: Illustrator CS newly shares some text-handling components with both InDesign
    and Photoshop, and the main text layout engine with Photoshop. <BR> <BR>This represents
    a complete and total overhaul of basic text functionality in the application.
    I would be very surprised if it didn&#39;t handle kerning pairs from TrueType
    fonts. I&#39;m a little surprised if Illustrator 9 didn&#39;t, but it&#39;s possible.
    <BR> <BR>Actually, did you revise the font and add the kerning and replace the
    already active version? It may be that you managed to confuse Illustrator. Try
    quitting all Adobe apps, deactivate the font if you&#39;re using a font manager,
    and then delete and &#34;adobefnt.lst&#34; files from the same directory as where
    the font is being activated from. Then reactivate the font and relaunch Illustrator.

  body: Yes, when I revise the font I quit Illustrator, take the old font out of ATM,
    put the new font in ATM and then relaunch Illustrator again and test the font.
    Other changes to the font that I make show up, weight, shape, but the hand-kerning
    that I do in Fontographer doesn&#39;t show up, like the Tr, To, etc..BUT it does
    show up in Quark, but even that seems a little off like Quark is kerning my kerning.
    <BR> <BR>So, Thomas, if the font kerning doesn&#39;t show-up on Illustrator 10
    or CS, then what? Any suggestions other than I&#39;ve butchered this font? <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for answering. You guys are ON!
