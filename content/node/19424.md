  body: Ahh yeah that is it, I do not think my html coding is really up to scratch
    as I have been trying to get the image to show for the last 20mins. So thank you
    for that. It is much appreciated.

  body: Unfortunately this logo looks custom drawn, so I don't know if you'll be able
    to do the name-swap easily.

    target=\"_blank\">Compacta</a>, oblique it, and add some little triangles as serifs.
