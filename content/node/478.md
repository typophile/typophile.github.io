    a reclusive person for some time and things are coming back to me now I am more
    active. <BR> <BR>I would like to see what happens in your book. I imagine it will
    be prohibitively expensive? Are you printing letterpress, polymer plates, lead?

    Started using photopolymer in 1991.  <BR> <BR>Photopolymer is just a great printing
    surface; with a platemaking machine it&#39;s like having your own Monotype caster
    but not being limited to Monotype. And desktop publishing software and digital
    type is a blessing, is now and has been for some many years. <BR> <BR>Well, yeah,
    Moxon will be prohibitively expensive. About a grand. When you are printing a
    book with a hand-operated press and using handmade paper that cost $7.50 a sheet,
    and it sucks up a couple years of your life, yeah, it gets expensive. On our last
    book, a speculative book on the proof of Gutenberg, I think my partner and I spent
    around $70,000 on a book that was printed in an edition of 146 copies. Now that&#39;s
    a risky investment when you are not making a book that is intentionally directed
    at any market whatsoever. More like, this is what we want to do and this is what
    we have to do, so let&#39;s get down on our knees and pray.  <BR> <BR>Basically,
    just an idiotic career choice. <BR> <BR>A wish-we-could book currently in research
    stage is on the 16th century astronomer Tycho Brahe!!! A very interesting and
    strange and important fellow. We will have a lot of fun with this one. Well, at
    least, initially. <BR>

  body: Hrant,  <BR> <BR>I see what you see, only I read it differently. I see cleaning
    out the corners. The metal must be clean or it will not relieve when cast. It
    will &#34;hold&#34; when the type is removed. What I can see is evidence of gravure
    slippage, or manipulation error on the top crotch of the &#34;h&#34;.  <BR> <BR>On
    the &#34;b&#34; if your theory was correct the punchcutter has lost control. Please
    draw your eye to the top bowel-crotch of the ascending stem. Either the top crotch
    is an error, or the bottom crotch an error? Take your pick. There is no need for
    one without the other. If you take issue to the nature of stems and placement
    compare the situation on the companion areas of the &#34;d&#34;. <BR> <BR>So no
    more yeah buts . . . please! <BR> <BR>If &#34;ink trapping&#34; were &#34;the
    intention&#34; the application &#34;should be even&#34;. His work, as you can
    easily see, is not that fussy. <BR> <BR> <BR>Or, lots of theory, little ability
    to apply.  <BR> <BR>Meaning this artifact lends little support to your hypothesis.
    If he is cutting ink trapping intentionally he should have enough skills to apply
    his principals evenly throughout. I am not disparaging the beauty of his letterforms
    in fact the cut-look-&amp;-feel is integral to the very beauty. The crudeness
    is in effect, much more than secondary to the design. <BR> <BR>But &#34;ink trapping&#34;,
    come come. <BR> <BR>These letters are much as if they were cut in linoleum or
    wood. Those are the characteristics which come easily when using similar tools
    such as a gravure. There are large and small gravures. Tools, including needles
    are used in small point sizes or tight areas. These cuts are &#34;humongoumamouth&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>Looking at these letterforms I see forms worked by mostly a single gravure,
    large by type cutting standards. Certainly it, possibly them, would be used only
    in the crudest of work when cutting an 8 pt. character. Probably, not even then.  <BR>
    <BR>The very nature of these letterforms does not required fine gravures. The
    large gravure&#40;s&#41; have given the design the intended emotions of the designer.
    Cutting emotions. I suggest a more finished look  would have greatly reduced its
    appeal. <BR> <BR>If you view the crotch in the Q you will see a place where it
    would &#34;certainly deserve&#34; the &#34;ink trap treatment&#34; you refer to
    &#34;if the punchcutter believed as you&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I see a punchcutter seeking
    a-cut-look-&amp;-feel to his letterforms, and getting it. Forgiving people such
    as yourselves for mistaking them to be either faults, or &#34;in your&#40;s&#41;
    case&#40;s&#41;&#34; inktraps in order to achieve the characteristic nature of
    the letterforms that have drawn our attentions. By the way, which because of the
    tooling, are acidly beautiful. <BR> <BR>You have to love it for what it is, not
    for what you want it to be. You should remember that boys, and the girls shall
    be forever thankful. <BR> <BR>There is an acid sharpness throughout, and I suspect
    lots of &#34;gravure&#34;, little &#34;file&#34;.  <BR> <BR>There is a general
    crudeness throughout and if you notice the &#34;h&#34; has another mis-cutting
    on the top left curve. Also if you view the beard of the same character you will
    see a flatness on the lower portions of the gravure straightening into perpendicular
    at the top of the stroke meeting close to the same error. He is giving a lot of
    meaning to free handing and that I believe issues much of the beauty of this particular
    typeface.  <BR> <BR>I highly recommend that some of you consider cutting types
    yourselves. The impossibility is merely an obstacle in your minds. But remember,
    there is few of us left. Contact Jim Rimmer. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>Lanston

    <BR>My friend, don&#39;t make me give up on you. Those are classic traps. Why
    so much resistance? Is your stance that trapping doesn&#39;t even exist, that
    it&#39;s only my imagination? Come on. The traps in that font are all over the

    about it. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, the traps are indeed too big for that point
    size, and also, it&#39;s simply not a very good trapping job in terms of maintaing
    size and shape - it&#39;s hard to do consistently, which is probably one reason
    not many people do it. Look at the trapping in DTL Fleischmann, a digital face
    where there is no graver to slip: it&#39;s all over the place. <BR> <BR>BTW, Pascal
    is not a &#34;crude&#34; face, intentionally or otherwise. Are you at all familiar
    with it? <BR> <BR>&#62; If you view the crotch in the Q <BR> <BR>So you&#39;ve

    corners &#40;not just the top&#41; of the counter of the &#34;A&#34;?... <BR>

    another &#40;source: S Carter&#41;, and it doesn&#39;t! So it was not an aesthetic
    decision on the part of the designer himself &#40;and hopefully the punchcutter
    didn&#39;t make any aesthetic decisions on his own, certainly not at the larger
    sizes!&#41;, it was a technical decision on the part of the punchcutter. Or it

    <BR> <BR>Good, good. <BR>I hope that his duly respected skills at punchcutting
    are matched by a grasp of past practice, of how some other people have chosen
    to cut type. Many good digital type designers don&#39;t use traps - but even they
    have to admit that some others do! <BR> <BR>&#62; Perhaps his cutting was intended
    for someone not so thrifty with tins of ink! <BR> <BR>I agree &#40;and I already
    stated&#41; that I think the traps there are too big. <BR>But at least this way
    we have more proof that they -and the <i>intentions</i>- were there! <BR> <BR>On
    the other hand, I think you would agree that people tend to use too much ink &#40;and
    pressure&#41; more often than too little, no? That at least is [the other] Gerald&#39;s
    view, and he&#39;s not a dilettante like me! <BR> <BR>&#62; Can you tell one from
    the other? <BR> <BR>No, and it&#39;s things like this where I need the most help,
    from people like you. <BR> <BR>My only faint clue here is that -according to the
    director of Neufville as well as a former student of his- Mendoza y Almeida drew
    all the necessary sizes &#40;or at least very narrow ranges&#41; himself. How
    would this have affected the role of the pantograph? And coming around to that
    issue I wanted to one day approach you with, how might Benton&#39;s so-called
    &#34;cutting slips&#34; &#40;mentioned in Rehak&#39;s book&#41; be relevant here?
    &#40;So maybe today is the day then! I wish I had a Cessna to fly to Finland...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Working away from a crotch enacts a digging motion. Work into a
    crotch there will is a lifting motion. <BR> <BR>This is very interesting, and
    I admit very logical. But a good punchcutter &#40;or the pantograph?&#41; would
    be able to reduce/eliminate this effect, no? I have many questions - much to learn...
    Where exactly do you see the effects of this phenomenon you describe in the Pascal
    60? Maybe in the fact that the &#34;b&#34; has a much deeper cut than the &#34;d&#34;?
    It might be important here to state explicitly that the scan has been flipped
    horizontally, for easy decipherment of the letters. <BR> <BR>But it also seems
    like some shapes have symmetrical cuts &#40;both with respect to their flanking
    sides as well as with respect to the location on the letterform&#41;, irrespective
    of cutting direction. And also, some shapes &#40;not necessarily the ones I&#39;ve
    scanned&#41; are missing traps/nicks where I would expect to see some - these
    are generally secondary ones, like the asterisk, but sometimes it seems like they
    just forgot &#40;which also happens in digital too, like in the DTL Fleishmann
    I mentioned&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; The 12 point appears natural <BR> <BR>? <BR>It
    has a huge trap! <BR>And remember, that was a <i>print</i>. <BR> <BR>&#62; I ask
    again whether the type was cut and then &#34;electroplated&#34; or just &#34;punched&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>I would have to ask Henk Gianotten, who used to work for Tetterode before
    they went under. <BR> <BR>&#62; Font le Roy, San Francisco you will see sparkling

    your intense messaging back and forth with Hrant Papazian about the ink-trapping
    situation. <BR> <BR>I am certain that no such thing existed in metal type. I certainly
    recall that in using your comparator to re-drawe letters for you from your Lanston
    punches that just the reverse was true. In the corners and pinches, the shapes
    were terminated with a small radius, because of the revolving cutter on the pantograph.
    <BR> <BR>It seems that Lanston did not deem it necessary to hand-nick out these
    tight spots. You and I both know that a person can print with no problem with
    Monotype type. It&#39;s all in the hand of the pressman that scoops the ink out
    of the can. A little bit goes a long way. I don&#39;t think it has ever been the
    responsibility of the type  manufacturer or punch cutter to try to anticipate
    with how much vigor and enthusiasm the pressman applies the ink. <BR> <BR>Since
    I am not a member of ATypI I cannot get involved in the forum. Perhaps that is
    a good thing. There is slittle to be gained from getting heated about a thing
    like that. <BR> <BR>I finally got finished with the job of cutting flat mat accents
    for 18 point Nicholas Cochin for Lucy lambert, and am now involved in the alignment
    and <BR>fitting of the 14 point Cartier Roman font that I cut 14 point flat mats
    for last month. I have to gop back and recut a few letters, but overall it is
    <BR>looking quite good. <BR> <BR>It will be necessary to hand rub all the casting
    becasue of the leave created by directly engraving flat the mats. If more than
    a few people are interwsted in buying type, I am going to ship the type in individualbaggies,
    and send each buyer a free file along with the type. <BR> <BR>Hope all is well
    with you in your new island paradise. Drop me an E. <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;
    <BR> <BR>Yes Jim, we both seem to agree that ink is far to cheap. I think the
    pigment should be made from burnt flesh from &#34;errant pressman&#34;. Then maybe
    types would cease to be tortured making the world a prettier place for our children
    to read in. <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t that a romantic thought? Maybe I should write poetry.
    Do you like poetry Jim? <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>the Lanston Type Company <BR>

  body: '&#62; Read 24 pt. instead of 12 <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pretty obvious to me that
    the 24 point would look much more &#34;brisk&#34; &#40;and in character, considering
    the overall design - again, are you familiar with Pascal?&#41; if it had traps
    in the crotches between the stem and the bowl. <BR> <BR>Maybe you just like the
    mushy 70s style of font?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; My inviting him would not have
    the impact of your inviting him. <BR> <BR>? <BR>You said you&#39;ve been in twice-daily
    contact with him for a decade... Just tell him you don&#39;t have to be a member
    of ATypI &#40;you don&#39;t even need to register anywhere for anything&#41;,
    and encourage him to join the fray. But if he doesn&#39;t enjoy &#34;iterative&#34;
    &#40;as opposed to one-sided&#41; discussion, well, that might explain why he&#39;s
    never heard of trapping!  :-/ <BR> <BR>But really, the point at which trapping
    started being used &#40;I hope nobody will claim that the traps in <i>digital</i>
    DTL Fleischman are slips of the graver...&#41; is secondary&#42; - the question
    is if they&#39;re useful &#40;when the right size&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Although
    a serious and deliberate analysis of very many metal fonts &#40;not just Pascal&#41;
    reveals traps in certain classic places, like inside the tail of the UC &#34;Q&#34;.
    Soon I will show you some Palatino. <BR> <BR>&#62; In the corners and pinches,
    the shapes were terminated with a small radius, because of the revolving cutter
    on the pantograph. <BR> <BR>Anybody relying [only] on a pantograph to cut punches
    certainly doesn&#39;t care about admittedly secondary refinements such as traps.
    But refinements nonetheless. <BR> <BR>&#62; a pattern has a mistake and it is
    used for multiple sizes, the &#34;mistake&#34;, allow me, will be multiplied.
    <BR> <BR>But: <BR>1&#41; My point was that the 24 doesn&#39;t have trapping &#40;at
    least not to the extent that the 48/12 do&#41;, so it wasn&#39;t an aesthetic
    decision &#40;like you proposed&#41;. <BR>2&#41; The traps in the 48 and 12 are
    different. <BR> <BR>Also remember: Mendoza y Alemeida drew separate versions for
    different sizes - or least small ranges - certainly the 48 and 12 weren&#39;t
    from the same drawing. The really good guys didn&#39;t rely on the pantograph
    too much. <BR> <BR>&#62; His cure is worse than the ailment. <BR> <BR>At 60 point
    especially, the traps -certainly the one in the &#34;b&#34;- are indeed too big.
    But there would have to be a difference of a couple of bottles of Muscatel for
    the guy to be so bad at cutting on the &#34;b&#34; and then so fine on the &#34;A&#34;
    for example. <BR> <BR>The point isn&#39;t how badly/well the cutter did his job,
    the point is the <i>intention</i>. And to me it&#39;s crazy to claim it wasn&#39;t
    there. <BR> <BR>&#62; Jim and I can certainly offer knowledge previously unavailable
    to you. <BR> <BR>Certainly, and I appreciate that greatly. The one thing I&#39;m
    most anxious to learn about involves something on your site: &#34;One of Lanston&#39;s'

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>Actually decades of double daily discussions with Jim. Remember
    he was involved in the Giampa Textware days. But for the last decade I have seen
    Jim maybe twice, and only briefly. <BR> <BR>For absolute accuracy nothing could
    beat a Benton Pantograph. The specifications were beyond reproach. Far smaller
    than the human eye could perceive. For instance the tolerances of measurement
    was no more than 1 / 100,000 of an inch. The measuring scale is 2 feet long in
    degrees so fine that it requires a microscope to read them. Technology used in
    punch cutting for mechanical type manufacture had tolerances and requirements
    far in excess of what is humanly possible. <BR> <BR>Furthermore in setting up
    the tool to measure it must be sent to the standards bureau in France. The freight,
    because of the heat requirements and vibration prevention cost us over $2700.
    and that does not include the cost of adjustment. The device must be in a constant
    operating temperature, the work to be measured had to be in the same room until
    it reached its own room temperature. <BR> <BR>Sure we cared about type. You bet.  <BR>
    <BR>You would kill for the dedicated comparator. This was a special magnification
    device for viewing types or matrices. It might not agree with your theory however.
    <BR> <BR>The height-to-paper machine was also a microscopic device. If you made
    a slight mistake in motion you could loose the face of the matrice for weeks,
    literally. Tiny matrices became a moonscape. <BR> <BR>You have to understand the
    importance that mechanical typesetting was to mankind. You speak of the reading
    public. Without systems of which I speak we would all be illiterate. Spacing was
    also far superior in a Monotype than hand-set. I resisted that thought but soon
    came to appreciate the systems that were developed. <BR> <BR>These matters are
    an entire new area of discussion. There is a book you should read by Krimpen that
    was put together by John Dreyfus. It deals with this very topic in letter form
    back and for with someone you are biased against. Stanley Morison. I enjoyed Krimpen

    <BR>But it couldn&#39;t reproduce a sharp inside corner, right? <BR> <BR>&#62;
    Spacing was also far superior in a Monotype than hand-set. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    know anybody else who thinks that. <BR> <BR>&#62; The samples you have provided
    would have never met the rigid controls of either of the two Monotypes. <BR> <BR>One
    more time: I don&#39;t care about the quality of the execution, just the nature
    of the intention. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t discredit the pantograph more than I discredit
    the technology of television, or even a kitchen knife for example; it&#39;s not
    the tool, it&#39;s what you do with it. The pantograph wasn&#39;t guilty of anything
    - the Benton boys even tried to get people to use it properly - but they failed:
    people used it to save effort/money, nothing more. Even though the pantograph&#39;s
    technology allowed for it, optical sizing died - it simply became too easy <i>not</i>
    to do it anymore. So this tragedy happened way before phototype. <BR> <BR>hhp
