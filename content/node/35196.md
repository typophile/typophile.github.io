  body: I'm not into kerning yet. Should I think about the kerning while i draw the
    font? And which serif do you prefer? The ones on the T or the A?

  body: "This might be too light for small usage (business card etc), the weight of
    the C looks about right as a minimum (although the distribution needs work), the
    crossbar of the T is too wide for my taste and taking Satya\u2019s line as the
    overshoot it should fall short, probably to the height of the top left serif of
    the N. Is this going to be a font or just used as a logo? Either way kerning should
    be considered now.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Being that they appear to be mainly an online entity, you may want to consider
    a beefier weight so that the log can be reproduced at smaller sizes on-screen.

    I find \"C\" too pointed at the end of the stroke (bottom). This is just going
    to give you headaches and problems later. And It doesn't really look it should
    be this thin."
