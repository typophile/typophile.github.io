body: 'thanks stephen. <BR> <BR>Nathan, the only thing I can think of <BR>is that
  this is from Adam Roe &#40;Solace or <BR>Article 10&#41;...but Adam was based in
  Los Angeles <BR>and he moved to New York, I think. <BR> <BR>His site is large/i&#39;m
  on dialup today so I can&#39;t confirm <BR>where he&#39;s at. <BR> <BR>confounded
  : nice work <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>'

  body: well, Adam&#39;s current site lists New York.. <BR> <BR>maybe he was in Chicago
    a long time ago? <BR> <BR>Hal al Shedad had a release on Lunchbox. <BR> <BR>mistrial
    or mis-trail. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Adam Roe&#39;s are nice, and Solace and Article 10 are quite close, but not
    yet it. To be honest, I don&#39;t even know the name of this font&#39;s designer
    - but it&#39;s not Roe.  <BR> <BR>Lunchbox isn&#39;t it either ;-&#41;

  body: I&#39;m gonna be heading back to my Luddite hovel, <i>sans</i> web, in a few
    minutes. I once again apologize for any inconvenience. If you find the Hal al
    Shedad, you should listen to the mp3s. Darn good band. If you run across an mp3
    for &#34;Riding with Angels,&#34; let me know... <BR> <BR>Cheers.

    There&#39;s a preview in the upper window when you mouse-over, but that&#39;s
    the only capital you see. <BR> <BR>Take it away...
