body: ' I was just wondering what some people thought were the best serif faces ever,
  and/or the trendiest serif face ever? This is partly for a project I&#39;m working
  on at school where I have to design a specimen book for the fonts of my choice.
  The concept for the book is &#34;the fashionable serif&#34; and all of the book
  will be based on fashion. I&#39;m going to creat t-shirts with the specimen on the
  front and the name across the back like a baseball jersey. Anyways, any thoughts
  on the best serifs would be great. <BR>I&#39;m particularly fond of Goudy. '

  body: ' My vote for favorite serif face would have to go to Jenson &#40;designed
    by Nicolas Jenson&#41; and its various progeny. <BR> <BR>My favorite adaptation
    of Jenson is Cloister Old Style &#40;Morris Benton&#41;, but I have yet to find
    a really good digitization of this typeface family. Rolling Stone Magazine uses
    a beautiful version that they commissioned for their body face. <BR> <BR>I also
    like Parkinson &#40;Jim Parkinson&#41;, also based on Jenson. <BR> <BR>Golden
    Type &#40;William Morris&#41;, Centaur &amp; Arrighi &#40;Bruce Rogers, Frederic
    Warde&#41; and Adobe Jenson &#40;Robert Slimbach&#41; are also worthy interpretations
    of the Jenson design forms. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on my own design, Architrave,
    which is partly &#40;and loosely&#41; based on the Jenson model, and is currently
    showing in the Serif Critique forum. <BR> <BR>David '

    For a fresher take on Bodoni check out Hoefler&#39;s Didot. <BR> <BR>PS-- Your
    question reminds me of own quest for the perfect serif face. The old &#40;1998?&#41;
    Klein bicycles annual report that Cahan did. It&#39;s a beautiful face that I&#39;ve
    never had a moment to research... <BR> <BR>//joe '

  body: ' Well, overall. <BR>But the &#34;U&#34; is one good example. For one thing,
    that&#39;s the way the Romans would have made it. But Perpetua isn&#39;t just
    some anachronistic affectation: it&#39;s timeless. Well, at least timeless in
    relation to Western culture. <BR> <BR>Perpetua is austere, without being oppressive.
    It has a serious grace that doesn&#39;t need to prove itself. In comparison, Adobe
    Trajan is a Roman legionnaire who&#39;s been spending way too much time in Bay
    Area Starbuckses. <BR> <BR>hhp '
