  body: It's different, but it reminds me a little of tiny paint blobs which take
    on a familiar shape. Pretty nice.

  body: "Yes, Chris. I thought you knew. :o)\r\n\r\nAdam, actually in the name of
    green washing, its my non-eco eco-font... \r\n\r\nReminds me of two things: Plastic
    Popsicle sticks from back the sixties. They clicked together to become a building
    toy (You had to put up with a lot of brain-freeze to get enough sticks to make
    anything worthwhile)... And bead-work. which is how it gets the name."
