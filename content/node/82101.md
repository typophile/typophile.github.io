  up at <a href=\"http://www.samfogg.com/\">Sam Fogg</a> in London a few years ago.
  I hadn't noticed it until yesterday. The catalogue says it is probably Nigerian,
  from the early 20th Century: one page from a prayer book of 60 folios with four
  lines per page, all in this wonderful polychromatic style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nigerian_4994.jpg]"

  body: very interesting :), I like how "waw" is connected to the baseline, very good
    idea for a fat face.
