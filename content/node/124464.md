  body: "Can't identify it but pretty convinced some others will do. It's some sort
    of high contrasted Bodoni/Didot Condensed Light. That could also be bespoke (moreover
    if it comes from the fashion/luxe industry). For the time being, would you please
    share more about your sample like the origin (a website I guess), more letters,
    a larger glyph set sample? That could ease the search.\r\nSome alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/fashion-didot|Fashion
