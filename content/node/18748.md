      translation (UC Press, 1995): \"Aurora Grotesk, shown in the Berthold Phototypes
      E1 catalog (1974), was identified as the typeface closest to that used in the
      original German edition.\" (It goes on to explain that this wasn't available
      digitally so others were chosen for the translation.)\r\nThe sample in this
      thread is from a publicity leaflet for the book, which is also reproduced in
      the introduction (p.xxi) of the translation. "

    the very late 1800s into the early 1900s.

    as <em>the</em> Akzidenz Grotesk. And you certainly cannot (oldnick) compare a
    digital sample of AG Light with a printed one from the 20s. AG \u2013 and that's
    all I'll repeat from previous posts \u2013 has been through many iterations, from
    hot metal, where every size looked different, to photosetting, where one design
    had to fit all sizes, to digital where there is AG and AG Old Style.\r\n\r\nThe
    sample is definitely set in AG Regular and Bold (Fett). The Super weight was introduced
    in the 60s only, designed by GG Lange. It never existed in hot metal."

    Grotesk': a 'jobbing sanserif,' designed anonymously, probably in the 1900s. For

    doing some redaing during a lersiurely afternoon. I was looking back to some pages
    in \"Paul Renner: The Art of Typography\" by Christopher Blake, and came across
    some comments concening Tschicholds' reasoning for not setting Die Neue Typographie
    with Futura. Here is an excerpt:\r\n\r\n<i>\"Jan Tschichold's book, Die Neue Typographie,
    could have feasibly been set in Futura, which was already on the market when the
    book was in preperation. Even if the typeface had not been quite ready, Renner
    could have secured its use for the book; instead Tschichold has it set in a grotesk
    (AG?). There may have been an element of personality clash in this decision; yet,
    when asked in 1960 why he had not used Futura for the book, Tschichold replied
    that he never really deemed it suitable for setting texts.\"</i>"
