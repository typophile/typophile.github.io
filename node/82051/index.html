  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm in the process of getting a business idea in motion. I work with a very talented calligrapher. Eventually, I'd like to create an online site that would sell his fonts.

Initially, in getting started, I'd like to run through the process of converting a scanned image to completed font. I'd like to get a feel for how much time will be invested into each face.

The focus is going to be hand-drawn type - this brings with it the implication that these fonts might carry a lot of edge texture with them. With this in mind, what is the best route to take? 

Ideally, I'd like to vectorize each letter form, but I've heard their might be issues if letterforms get too detailed. I don't think I want to go the bitmap route. Is there any rule of them for determining if a typeface is too detailed to vectorize?

What program would be best for accomplishing this? Fontlab? Not sure what options exist? I own photoshop and illustrator, but I'm going to have to put some money out there for obtaining a font program.

To give some context to this project. I'm a graphic/web designer, been in the industry for 10 years. The guy I am working with has been at it for over 40 years. He published and known in his niche. </div>

I don't think that's so much of an issue these days.
However, you might experiment by acquiring some fonts that have complex glyph outlines and testing them on various devices.
Or do your own tests, by seeing how much performance difference is made by variations with different numbers of BCPs.</div>

Only if your time is worth nothing. FontForge is like Fontlab, but the interface is twice as confusing and twice as ugly. And the program itself seems to be twice as unstable. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is no clear way to evaluate the amount of time it will take to digitize these fonts if you're doing it yourself from the start. 

I agree that FontLab is your best bet. Like with anything though, it really depends on how much you're willing to invest in time and energy vs. what you want in outcome. Calligraphers typically write and connect letters in different ways depending on the context. To capture all the nuance and subtlety accurately would require going the longer route of learning the program well and doing the fonts in OpenType. Getting feedback from your calligrapher along the way would also be helpful. 

Maybe it would be worth your while to find someone in the Chicago area that does font development to work with on the project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">James: <em>FontForge is like Fontlab, [...] the program itself seems to be twice as unstable.</em>

Although I don’t really see it as my task to defend FontForge, I actually think that this statement is a bit unfair. Programs may have overlapping functionality, but this does not mean by definition that the applied (quality of) technology is always identical. For instance the auto-hinter for TrueType in FontForge is one of the best I have seen so far. As you know, the program is also used for making the conversion to the Cufón format (locally or on the web). 

Perhaps it is not too simple to get FontForge running under X11 on the Mac or under Cygwin on the PC, but it installs very easy on, and runs solidly under Linux-distros, like for instance Ubuntu (I am actually impressed by version 11.x). Furthermore it is conveniently scriptable and it is for free (as are the Linux-distros). 

So far the advertisement for a competing product.

Josh: <em>Ideally, I'd like to vectorize each letter form [...]</em>

This requires a program that converts the scanned letters into single glyph databases in batch, I reckon. In DTL’s TraceMaster one can select a (theoretically unlimited) number of tiff’s and these will be converted into one font file, as shown in this small <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WNDdGu9Pqg&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL">YouTube movie</a>.

So far the advertisement for one of our own products.
