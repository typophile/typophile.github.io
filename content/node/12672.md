  tool.  Adobe I have found has recently discontinued their ATM (http://www.adobe.com/products/atm/main.html).
  \ They are pointing people to ATM light or Extensis Font Reserve (www.extensis.com/en/products/font_management.jsp).\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you guys use?  I hit 3,000 fonts this week so its time I do something about managing
  mine instead of waiting & waiting for them all to load.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input!\r\n\r\nJill"

  body: "I used Font Reserve for about 2 years, which is now an Extensis product,
    so I'm not sure what the latest version holds. It worked and wasn't too much trouble,
    but it didn't blow me away. Its Classic activation was a big deal for me then.
    Now I almost never use Classic and I don't use the machine that had FR on it.\r\n\r\nStephen
    Coles can tell you more about <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000767.php\">FontAgent
    Pro</a>. He's a fan.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I actually don't use anything right
    now. I manage my own small font collection manually, for the time being. Probably
    need to change that sometime soon."

    software possibilities.\r\n\r\nI use Suitcase and Font Doctor. I have found very
    few instances of wanting to send a voodoo hex upon the Extensis programmers heads."

  body: I use Suitcase also, it works quite well and I have not had any problems with
    it really. Although I do find Suitcase to be much more responsive on my PC, sometimes
    activating a large family takes a few seconds.

  body: Oh. I don't use auto-activation because it was so buggy in the early days
    of OS X. Thomas do you have crashes at all because of auto-activation?

    body: I use suitcase at work and activate fonts only for documents I'm using along
      the way otherwise it can crash the system. I have ATM delux at home but it works
      up until OS9??(not sure about this, but haven't used it for awhile) So far I
      luv Suitcase!

  body: "I'm wondering what's the difference between Font Reserve and Suitcase.  They
    seem similar by the descriptions and are by the same company.  Anyone know?\r\n\r\nI
    have long used Font Thing, a free app, for trying fonts.  I downloaded the trial
    of Suitcase, so far it looks good but I havent given it a workout yet."

  body: "FontAgent Pro!\r\n\r\nWorking with Suitcase / Font Doctor can be a nightmare
    (plugins crash Quark and InDesign, Suitcase corrupts fonts, Font Doctor gives
    the high sign to all kinds of corrupt fonts), and FontReserve is getting kind
    of creaky in its old age (it's been many years since either it or Suitcase X saw
    a major revision). FontAgent Pro is the simplest overall, and it almost never
    does anything unexpected to me, although <a href=\"http://www.typomancy.org/2005/05/03/a-tally-of-type-management-bugs-fontagent-pro-needs-help/\">I
    do have some issues with it</a>. It validates fonts as it imports them, and then
    it can validate them again prior to activating them. You can sequester fonts used
    for specific jobs or clients in their own libraries, which ensures you're using
    the same version of the fonts as the client and / or the service bureau.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, there's no good substitute for figuring out your own policy for managing
    fonts, and only keeping around the fonts you actually need or use on a regular
    basis. I used to have a gargantuan library (16,000+ -- obviously not all of those
    were legit) on call, and it caused way more problems than it solved. Reducing
    my library down to the stuff I could establish ownership of, and only activating
    the small subset of those I use on a daily basis, totally improved my user experience."

  body: "The biggest difference between FontReserve and Suitcase X is that the former
    wants to hoover up all the fonts on your system into its database (although it's
    possible to get it to leave them where they are).\r\n\r\nFontReserve runs as a
    headless application and Suitcase X runs as a regular application, sitting in
    the Dock. \r\n\r\nFontReserve tracks information about fonts in a relational database.
    It used to have problems with corrupting this database, but I ran it under Mac
    OS X between 2001 and 2004, placing pretty heavy demands on it, and it never corrupted
    my database.\r\n\r\nFontReserve sells a server solution that's pretty much the
    best / only game in town for service bureaus and design departments, although
    it has its own problems.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the two are pretty much the same,
    barring some UI differences (I think FontReserve has better font previewing capabilities
    than any of the others), but FontReserve crashes less."

  body: I have had Suitcase occasionally see fonts as corrupt. Simply "unmarking"
    them makes them usable. I don't think Suitcase has ever really corrupted any of
    my fonts.

    library to 50 fonts, and put the rest on a cd. When I want to use one of those,
    I pop in my cd \u2014 install the desired fonts and delete them in font book when
    I'm done with them. \r\n\r\nI really wish the Disable feature in Font Book actually
    did something. Oh well\u2026\r\n"
