  body: "The B looks like a flipped over version of the B from either Ronda, Yagi
    or Bauhaus (with the gap closed). If the 'b' is from the same font, these are
    not the source, but you can see them <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html\">here</a>
    in the Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide. The 'b' letter looks like something under
    the oval or oblong style category, which I haven't checked yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "'Leger' and 'Tantalus' both have a rather similar 'b' and an upside-down
    version of this B. I'm not sure if they come in more weights, but stroke thickness
    can be changed graphically. See them on <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces4.html\">this
    page</a> of the Bauhaus Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Surely the cap 'B' is just a vertically-flipped version of the cap 'B' in
    Bubble that I see on your excellent Bauhaus style sample page there Mike.\r\n\r\nJem
    - why anyone would want to do this is beyond me, though."

  body: Looks like it is based on <a href = "http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.9467.13.3&attributes.sampleSize=288&sampleText=obB&sampleSize=144">FF
    DIN</a>. The b seems to be based on the b and the o, the B is modified maybe by
    inserting its own curve?

    is a reason why but i'll spare you the boring answer.\r\n- Yes Tim the letters
    are modified Din, I was looking for a font that looks similar.\r\n\r\n"
