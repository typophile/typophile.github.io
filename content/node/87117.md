body: I have been tasked with designing/typesetting a large parliamentary report.
  In the past, such reports have used a combination of sans and serif typefaces (serif
  for body text, sans for indented quotations -- and there are plenty of them). I
  wondered if anyone might have a suggestion for a suitable (and reasonably priced)
  contemporary 'super-family'. I have used Myriad Pro/Minion Pro and Scala Sans/Serif
  in the past for similar projects, but I wanted to try something new. Any advice
  would be very welcome.

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I guess I was hoping someone could point a really
    beautiful / space-efficient sans/serif family. Perhaps I should think beyond that,
    as per http://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/jun2006_b/

  body: "You didn\u2019t say space-saving and beautiful before :)\r\nNovel could be
    a beautiful option then, Calluna a particular inexpensive, Bartholome and Jannon
    a space-saving, or Versa one that\u2019s (supposedly) used by a parliament, the
    Dutch. Celeste is rather neutral and versatile, Freight seen often but still great,
    Fresco an underused gem with informal and script fonts. More pointers still?"

    about Freight -- it's elegant and pretty reasonably priced. Thanks for your advice."

    It is a sober and neutral typeface with roots in the modern era, but with a pleasant
    digital minimalism about it. \r\nAnother great family, but less \u201Csafe\u201D
    is [[http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font_collection/font.php?ID=FNT02_03|Expo
    Sans]] and [[http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09_03|Expo
    Serif]], with more distinct features."

  body: Thanks all. Celeste was really lovely but unfortunately a little beyond my
    budget. I ended up buying Freight Sans/Serif. Cheers, Luke
