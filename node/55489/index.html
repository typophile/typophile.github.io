  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey Guys,
The company I work for currently designs a corporate magazine that deals with news/issues around the business/financial world i.e articles from banks, law firms, solicitors etc. The Mag is currently coming up for its 100th issue and the editors are thinking of a possible re-design/face lift for the mag. The mag is currently set in Frutiger LT throughout, which is used in various weights for body copy, captions, Headlines etc. Anyway... I thought it could be beneficial to open up to this forum to maybe get some suggestions for new typefaces to use for the re-design.

As it stands at the min I think the editors are keen to retain a san serif for the main body copy. The only other restrictions are that it should remain quite clean and 'corporate' looking. We were maybe thinking of introducing a fine slab serif font so any suggestions of families with san serif and slab serif variations would be welcome. At the moment the re-design is at the earliest stage so any suggestions are welcome... even if you think are a little left field. Thank you... and I look forward to any suggestions. </div>

There are numerous advantages to having one's exclusive typeface.

No budget for custom type design...even though a lot of the magazine's clients are large corporations the publishing company behind the magazine are a fairly small operation and tend to keep the budget as tight as possible. Thanks for your recommendations so far... I look forward to any more...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the main desirable idea now in the field of finance is trustworthiness. Fonts that used to look "corporate" (think narrow, formal) now look like something you want to throw a molotov cocktail at. So I think you need to find a font that's honest, warm but still very serious. To me a wide slab serif or wedge serif font would be just the thing. Slab serifs are the most honest but tend to be cold, while wedge serifs are still quite honest but warmer (and easier to read for long text). I have trouble recommending a sans here.

For slab serifs I'd say Chris's suggestion of Thesis is very good. You might look at Silica as well (FYI it doesn't have italics, but it does have a fine gradation of weights). For wedge serifs there are a few I like, but I don't feel too guilty first recommending my Patria. It was actually designed around this theme of humane, trustworthy competence. It's like a quiet wise uncle with a smile in his eyes. Below is a quick PDF, but please give me your email address (mine is hpapazian at gmail dot com) if you'd like to see more.
