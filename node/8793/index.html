		<div class="commentbody">Tamye et. al, <BR> <BR>I assume you have negotiated a lower rate than the $220 a night that the Roosevelt people are quoting me; how do I go about getting that? Seeing as there are several hotels within a few blocks that are MUUUCH less expensive, I'm curious why the &quot;meeting hotel&quot; is one of the more expensive in the neighborhood. No criticism, don't mean to sound accusatory, but the flights, fancy meals I've got planned (who wants to join me at Les Halles, Nobu, Balthazar and Craft? Also, of course, dim sum on Saturday AM at New Green Bo, but that's not fancy), and the $20 to get into MoMA now (!!) might wipe me out&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joshua, you're truly an early bird. We haven't posted all the hotel details yet, but never fear, we did indeed negotiate a significant discount for TypeCon attendees. The attendee rate is $165 a night for a superior single or double room. Mention TypeCon and SOTA and you should receive that rate. If it doesn't work, please let me know, and I'll get in touch with the hotel right away so they start quoting the right rate. <BR> <BR>Our rate of $165 is really great for that time of year at a nice hotel in New York. You can add a 3rd person to a room for $20 a night, and even a fourth for an additional $20 if you enjoy that much togetherness ;) The hotel and service is excellent. Trust me, we checked out tons of hotels to find the one that would give a good rate and be able to house all our attendees. Not to mention that it's in a safe and convenient neighborhood (just a few steps away from Grand Central and a straight shot down to Parsons). I am sure that you'll be happy with the hotel. <BR> <BR>In addition to the awesome service and great historical feel, the Roosevelt has an amazing lobby and large bar area that's perfect to hang out in. Nice health club on premises, and high-speed internet access in the rooms. <BR> <BR>We'll have a roomie finder service going soon for TypeCon attendees looking to pair up with someone to share a room during the conference.</div>

Can someone from SoTA tell us whether or not this is true? I guess I could always call the hotel again. I know I can negotiate a bit with the hotel but that seems tacky and I don't think they'll give SoTA the room night credit if I negotiate a lower rate on the phone (yes, it's possible, I just tried, but I do not recommend this for the reasons mentioned above).</div>

And Tiffany, we'll probably be having the omakase at Nobu Next Door ($75 per person I think?) or maybe nigiri at Sushi of Gari &hellip; and you will be informed of course. Sushi Yasuda is my favorite but last time I was there it was a couple hundred per person and I just can't justify that again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, Eric. I did indeed receive an email from you on March 11 and wrote you right back. Sorry you didn't receive my reply - we have had some email problems, but hopefully all is well now! <BR> <BR>The exact workshop schedule is not set yet, but the workshops will be held on Wed. and Thurs., July 20-21 (same schedule as last year). A number of interesting half-day and full-day workshops are in the works. Still working on developing a few of the sessions, so please bear with us until we have the workshop schedule and registration details finalized. <BR> <BR>Please try sending another email if you have further questions about anything other than the workshop schedule, or feel free to post here again. <BR> <BR>See you in New York!?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerry, your best bet is to call the hotel directly to book your room. Sometimes the independents (OK, the big chains, too) have a hard time getting their online booking systems synched with discount codes for events. <BR> <BR>I believe their reservations lines are open from 8am-8pm Monday thru Friday (East Coast Time). <BR> <BR>I have a call into our rep at the Roosevelt to see what insight he can offer regarding online booking. I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.</div>
