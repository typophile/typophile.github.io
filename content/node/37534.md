  - but unfortunately I don't have the $300 - does anyone maybe know of a cheaper
  typeface that is similar to this and of a reasonably high quality?\r\n\r\nI found
  this one that is free http://www.smackbomb.com/famousfonts/fonts/onedollar.html
  but its not great quality and the proportions are out a fair bit.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJamie"

  body: "Hi Jamie,\r\nyes, the whole [[http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/order_pack.html|LTR
    Federal pack]] is $300, but if you're looking for a single weight with shading,
    any of the [[http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/order_6.html|Six]], [[http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/order_9.html|Nine]],
    [[http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/order_12.html|Twelve]] or [[http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/order_18.html|Eighteen
    Line]] packs ships for $95. The Cameo -- [[http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/order_reserve.html|Reserve
    Note]] version is only $45.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nErik"

    several years ago. There''s something about this on the site for the "Designing
    Modern Britain" show that was up at the Design Museum in London a few years ago,
    which included a nice selection of Matthew Carter''s work: http://www.designmuseum.org/design/matthew-carter'
