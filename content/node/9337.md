  a custom? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.hitchnitch.com/baseball/indians2.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.hitchnitch.com/baseball/indians2.jpg</a>

  body: I agree with Ryan&#39;s reply, but if you want something similar &#40;i.e.
    with the swoosh underline&#41;, you will need a graphics application, like Illustrator
    &#40;to adjust and connect the swoosh&#41;, and then get <a href="http://letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/ballpark.shtml"
    target="_blank">&#34;Ballpark Script&#34;</a> from Letterhead Fonts, or <a href="http://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage.htm"
    target="_blank">&#34;Casey&#34;</a> from Flashfonts. A more antique swoosh design
    is <a href="http://letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/ephemera.shtml"
    target="_blank">&#34;Ephemera&#34;</a> also from Letterhead.
