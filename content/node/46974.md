  much appreciate if anyone knows which font this is, i know it's a little tweaked
  as you can see the \"a\" is different all three times, but if anyone would know
  from where it's originated I would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanx\r\nSruly"

    Script</a> if you insist on using a font.

  body: "Very similar, but also Glenn Yoshiyama or Iskra Johnson if it emanates from
    the Northwest. Georgia Deaver, Sherry Bringham or John Burns from California.
    John Stevens from North Carolina. Possibly Ivan Angelic from Canada.\r\n\r\nEach
    of these people are capable of rendering something like this and have done something
    similar in the past. There are others but these people would be a good place to
    start\r\n\r\nI can rule myself out 'cause I did not do it.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "My candidate for this lettering would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Leuschke|Rob
    Leuschke]], who has done several fonts that are quite similar (especially QuitcherBychen
    & TheNautiGal). I mention him often, because it seems so many casual scripts show
    up here as questions.\r\n\r\nHowever, i agree that the sample looks hand-drawn,
    and not a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Talked to Rob, twern't his as I thought. I left out Eliza Schulte in Florida.
    There are nuances that are proprietary to artists and I think the group I suggested
    is a good start. But I have been stupid and wrong before.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    who the lettering artist is - it's Ivan Angelic. Seems like Michael recognized
