body: "I don\u2019t know the rationale that was employed when Unicode included the
  ldot characters, but it doesn\u2019t make much sense typographically.\r\n\r\nThe
  main problem being that attaching the dot to one of the l\u2019s means that l\xB7l
  won\u2019t justify with the dot evenly spaced.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAs I understand
  it, this composite character is not keyed in manuscripts, with the standard procedure
  being to type \u201Cl periodcentered l\u201D, the periodcentered (punta volanta)
  being at \u201CShift 3\u201D on the Spanish keyboard (there being no Catalan keyboard).\r\n\r\nTherefore,
  I propose that the best practice for dealing with this situation in OpenType fonts
  is:\r\n\r\n<code>feature liga {\r\nsub l periodcentered' l by periodcentered.ldot
  ;\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\n\u2014where \"periodcentered.ldot\" is placed vertically
  and fitted to purpose.\r\n\r\nAn alternate periodcentered glyph is required because
  the standard periodcentered glyph is the width of the period, which is generally
  much too wide for this purpose, especially in serifed faces.\r\n\r\nThis addition
  to the Ligature feature won\u2019t interfere with documents where the editor/typographer
  uses the Unicode character for ldot, and has no bearing on documents in other languages,
  or math, where a periodcentered might conceivably be typed between two l\u2019s.\r\n"

    inclusion in one or more national standards. This explains a number of oddities
    in Unicode.\r\n\r\nYour method looks fine, although I would implement this in
    the ccmp feature, whence it cannot be turned off by the user. The correct position
    of the dot in Catalan is not discretionary. Note that you can also decompose the
    Unicode L/l with dot in ccmp, which would enable better justification spacing
    even if the Unicode character is employed in text."
