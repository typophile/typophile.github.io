body: "\tI'm doing some fixes on few OT fonts for a client, only one of which I did
  any previous work on. the others all work fine and only need a few cosmetic fixes.
  This one however, they say they can't access alternates. The feature code in this
  one I noticed is quite simple. In Calt feature it basically substitutes an alternate
  every time 2 characters are typed in a row. So you'd get c o o.alt l for \"cool\".\r\n\tThe
  font works perfectly on my computer and I'm still trying to troubleshoot. Here's
  what I've found out so far:\r\nClient has Mac OSX 10.1.1  InDesign CS2 and uses
  Suitcase 11.02 for a font manager. My tests were on ID CS3   OSX 10.4.8  I use Font
  Explorer.\r\nOne thing I thought might be up is a conflict with Stylistic sets.
  In InDesign I tried selecting both Stylistic sets and Contextual Subs at the same
  time. The Stylistic sets (and SALT) are all set up the same as CALT feature. This
  caused the substitution to go wacky and my default A would not come in as she described.
  She checked and said they weren't both selected and it happened no matter what was
  off or on.\r\n\tAny ideas where to go with this next? I wondered about simply deleting
  the SALT and SSxx features and see if that might cure it. but that doesn't seem
  very clear to me.\r\n\r\nStephen "

  body: Not quite sure if this is what you did, but you shouldn't use contextual substitutions
    in the <code>salt</code> feature. You should only use simple substitutions (<code>sub
    x by x.alt ;</code> or <code>sub x from [x.alt1 x.alt2 x.alt3] ;</code>, for example).
    No idea whether this is what's causing the problem.

  body: "Sorry Mark, \r\nSALT was simple one to one, not contextual. I didn't actually
    write the code for it, but it seems fine and works properly on my computer, just
    not on their CS2 for some reason. I keep wondering if ID CS2 either handles type
    differently or if there is something different with preferences or such that is
    doing it to them. I think InDesign doesn't use SALT though anyway, but who knows
    what the glitch here is.\r\nStephen"

  body: "I do recall reading about a change that occurred in CS3 where an old model
    for scripted substitutions was dumped in favor of another. Fonts made with the
    new version (5) of fontlab contain code that should work in both cs 2 & 3. The
    two places I recall bumping into something like this were in the fontlab 5 PDF
    guide and maybe also in a PDF available from Thomas Phinney's blog. I will see
    if I can dig these citations up. Hopefully they are relevant. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime
    why not post the code so we can see what you are really dealing with?"

    features such as calt or clig) so only \u201Cinvalid\u201D\r\ncontextual substitutions
    work in these early versions . In Microsoft\r\napplications, only \u201Cvalid\u201D

    you enable this option, FontLab Studio will generate a font with \u201Cinvalid\u201D\r\ncontextual
    features that will work correctly in InDesign 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 as\r\nwell as InDesign
    CS and CS2, but these contextual features will not work in\r\nOpenType-savvy applications

  body: "<cite>I looked for that option in preferences. If only I knew what I was
    doing???</cite>\r\n\r\nThe option which you marked red in your screenshot should
    be off, yes.\r\n\r\nIf I understand your feature order (post of 23.Jan.2008 7.40pm)
    and the feature code (post of 23.Jan.2008 5.56pm), then if a user switches on
    'ss01'/'ss02', then <em>all</em> 'normal' glyphs will be replaced by alternates,
    since substitution in these features is non-contextual. And once that happened,
    your 'calt' will not show any effect, of course.\r\nOne possible solution is using
    contextual substitution in 'ss01' and 'ss02' too. Then, if both 'ss01'/'ss02'
    and 'calt' are on, there's nothing left for 'calt' since there's no match for
    the context any more.\r\n\r\nYou write that \r\n\r\n<cite>The Stylistic sets (and
    SALT) are all set up the same as CALT feature.</cite>\r\n\r\nbut your code does
    not reflect this. 'ss01' is not contextual, 'calt' is. (I think that 'salt' doesn't
    matter here since it is not addressed by InDesign.)\r\nAlso you may check if the
    code\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>sub @upper @upper\u2019 by @calt1;</code>\r\n\r\n<em>really</em>
    does what you want. In your description you say \r\n\r\n<cite>In Calt feature
    it basically substitutes an alternate every time 2 characters are typed in a row.
    So you'd get c o o.alt l for \"cool\".</cite>\r\n\r\nbut what the feature does
    is substitute every second uppercase or lowercase by its alternate form, so if
    you type \"cool\" what you get is c o.alt o l.alt.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    I wonder if their system software ( OSX 10.1.1 ) might be part of their problem.
    I'm thinking of taking out the stylistic sets feature and seeing if that might
    help. Its kind of an odd arrangement because I'm not the designer of this font
    but agreed to do fixes as a favor to a friend. I'm hoping I can get this resolved

    apps manage/render fonts by themselves.)
