  body: '/T/''s color is much more lighter than the rest of the alphabet. /J/ doesn''t
    work: it''s "open", unlike the rest of the alphabet and therefore creates an edge
    effect, isolating it even more from the design style. /2/ looks like a kind of
    ampersand and /6/, /9/ are unrecognizable. I''d like to see /C/ and /G/ in a word
    to check if they really work as they are. I like the overall feel of the font,
    yet I think you should check the inconsistencies of the "cuts" of the letters.
    For instance, compare /R/''s bottom and right cut; and /M/, /V/, /W/, /X/, /Y/
    as opposed to /N/, /Z/. Good start ;)'

    - especially the 9, and agree that is doesn't work.\r\n\r\nGreat feedback on the
    consistencies of the cuts - this is something I didn't pick up on, but now that
    you've mentioned it, its the first thing I look at..\r\n\r\nC & G are below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dalelacy_no08_02_6307.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'll
    definitely take your feedback on board for round 2!"

    it symmetrical, is there any way of increasing the size without distorting the
    shape? Resize the widths of the rest of the characters maybe?"

  body: 'O: Just enlarge the circle from its center. It should overshoot the baseline
    and cap line some; this compensates for an optical effect where it doesn''t quite
    seem to meet them. The same principle should be applied to the 8, the bottom of
    the U, and anywhere else you can find it.'

    /9/ and possibly the top of the /C/ and the bottom of the /G/

  body: I think you've got the makings of two faces here, and you should save your
    work and then decide which one you want to do first. For the solid-blocks concept
    you seem to be going for, you can easily start filling in more notches to match
    that last new R. But I look at what you've got now for L,M,N,T,V,W,X and see what
    could be a very respectable heavy sans in the more traditional vein, so if you
    take the cue from those and start punching out counters I think you'll learn a
    lot more and finish with something more valuable.

  body: "You're on your way! Maybe I'm seeing things, but the R of 6:44 looks balanced
    while the R of 8:01 doesn't.\r\nD can stand to be wider, if that helps you distribute
    the weight.\r\nB will almost certainly need a different outer shape in this version
    if you want the counters to work.\r\nA: lower the counter.\r\nIt is not absolutely
    necessary for the bowl of P and R to be identical; enlarging the P bowl vertically
    may help.\r\n\r\nJ is still out there in what-are-you-doing land. Remove the right
    serif, or remove the whole serif-crossbar, or start over with a narrow J form.\r\n\r\nWhen
    it's all starting to come together, you'll want to look at the glyphs that are
    perfect for the block version (which, again, keep them for that) and decide whether
    they really fit this version. Z, for instance, should either be made as narrow
    as L or cut deeper. E and F are a toss-up: They may still fit, in a daring and
    distinct kind of way. You might bring down a full crossbar for F and leave E as
    it is. With the support of the current E and F you <em>might</em> even go for
    removing the top counter of B, which would something quite new."
