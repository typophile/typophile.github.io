body: "I've found [[http://typophile.com/node/15436|this thread]] of great comfort
  in my first Type 1 hinting foray, but I'm a bit confused by the FontLab Preview
  of the rasterisation. Or at least which is worth paying most attention to.\r\n\r\nThe
  three provided are Apple, Adobe and FreeType, of which Adobe and FreeType offer
  anti-aliased views. I assume that each displays the rendering intention of the respective
  engine -- Though I'm not sure why Apple's is aliased only or Adobe's is one model
  despite their applications each rendering type differently*. Also I'm assuming [[http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html|FreeType]]
  is an open source type engine. Is it used on GNU/Linux?\r\n\r\nAnyway, besides the
  seemingly random inclusion of these three, what would be the best one to pay close
  attention to? Or should I be flicking between them all? Or none of them? My worry
  is that they are very different and adjustments for one seems to mangle the output
  on the others. Is there any hope of <em>really</em> predicting what will happen
  out there in the real world on different systems? Or is it more a question of faith?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I'm surprised there is no emulation of print rasterisation -- though I suppose that
  isn't too easy on-screen.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rasteriser_6211.png]\r\n\r\n*I'm
  guessing these are the only licensed engines FontLab can use."

    my 400 glyphs (less the comps) and my money is on faith.
