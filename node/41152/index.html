  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Maybe the definition of the word has changed. 

A WIDOW is the last line of a paragraph that has found itself all alone at the top of the following page.

It is NOT a single word at the end of a paragraph on a line by itself.

Yet it continually amazes me that art directors, professional designers, and professors who teach graphic design do not know this. I encounter daily young designers who will take great pains to ensure words like "combustible" and "nationality" are not without company.

Of course, lone words less than four letters -- please don't call them widows, as they are not -- should find their way back among their friends, if possible. Otherwise, stop spending precious time trying to solve something that is neither an error or a problem. And when I ask you, "where's my ad?" don't whine and look pleadingly toward Heaven (or the pigeons mating in the rafters) and mumble, "just fixing a few widows; it will only be a minute." There are no widows in a one-page ad!

There. I've said it.</div>

So I checked that Wiki definition, and with a credit to Rob Carter, doesn't it say that the term "widow" can "also be used to refer simply to an uncomfortably short (e.g. a single word or two very short words) final line of a paragraph?"

		<div class="commentbody">I think that the accepted meaning of the term widow has changed over time to refer to the one word last line, and you have to accept that. Or else be the annoying designer who lectures all the editors who mark them as "widows". Therefore becoming someone else's pet peeve.

MY pet peeve is when you call someone on a cell phone instead of just the message and the beep you get: "to leave a message just wait for the tone (yup, got that). When you have finished recording you may hang up (um... we know that too) or press 1 for more options (does anybody ever do that?). To leave a callback number press 5 (um... isn't our number already stored under received calls?) To page this person press pound (anybody EVER do that???)" Meanwhile wasting our precious minutes.

Another pet peeve? Friends who sit across from each other on the subway instead of next to each other, meaning they have to talk very loudly to communicate.

And... people who don't use bcc for all the names in the email, instead putting them all in the To line, which results in lots of unwanted emails from people hitting "reply all".</div>

My Editor hates them, says they have to go. And yet, there's a gigantic apostrophe error in the 72 point bold headline that gets no mention.

How about the "Masthead"/flag/nameplate pet peeve? That one gets me all the time, because you almost *have to* refer to it incorrectly to get someone to understand what you are talking about, and correcting other people almost has zero effect.

The best line I ever heard from the Ad Manager talking to an Ad Rep about the "difficulties" she was having with one of the designers was "Just tell him to set everything in Arial. It's the most legible font of all time. That's why Microsoft uses it."

		<div class="commentbody">Like I said, I think it's simpler to just accept that editors will mark short last lines (whether just at the end of a paragraph or at the top of a new page) as widows than to try to re-educate them all. 

FWIW Dictionary.com lists both meanings:

3.	Printing.
a.	a short last line of a paragraph, esp. one less than half of the full measure or one consisting of only a single word.
b.	the last line of a paragraph when it is carried over to the top of the following page away from the rest of the paragraph. Compare orphan (def. 4).

American Heritage Dictionary:

Printing
a. A single, usually short line of type, as one ending a paragraph, carried over to the top of the next page or column.
b. A short line at the bottom of a page, column, or paragraph.

		<div class="commentbody">> How about the “Masthead”/flag/nameplate pet peeve? 

Oooh, oooh, is this the peeve venting thread? I want to add headline/heading to the list. There is no headline on the story at the bottom of page 5. There is only one headline in the newspaper. At best you can call the top heading on a section front a headline, but no others.

I agree with Patty on the fact that widow technically is any short line, and has only come to mean the first line at the top of a page over time. Donald Knuth, in the TeXbook, also talks about something called a club line (along with widows and orphans). I have never run across that anywhere else.
