body: Hello to every one, I would like to present Lisboa Typography because I want
  to get some feedback &#40;critique&#41;.  The work is not completed but I have been
  working to finnished all sets until the summer. This is a part of the work but I
  think this versions are sufficient to show the idea between &#40;regular, italic,
  small caps, dingbats&#41;. The first objective in this project was devolopment a
  humanist sans serif typography for text with a good performance on small sizes for
  use on a graphic composition for the magazine of portuguese teacher&#39;s from Portugal
  &#40;APP-2000&#41;. In the same time I started with the dingbats version which the
  principal influence was the signs and the symbolic forms of the city of Lisbon.
  The forms of the letters are neo-humanist and this variation have a hooked head
  terminal. The contrast of the letters are medium and the stress between thick and
  thin strokes have left-angled. The forms are more condensed to give a economy of
  space as text font. So I aspect some opinions. <BR> <BR>Regards /Ricardo <BR><img

  body: ricardo <BR> <BR>amazing work you got here, and i also liked very much your
    web site <BR> <BR>the only thing a can said at first sight is that i  think you
    shouldn&#39;t be so shy with the ascenders and descenders in your lc numbers <BR>
    <BR>ah, and if you thought this font form small sizes you should be carefull in
    the ff ligature with the tail of the middle f, i think that the small space betwen
    them is going to disapear at 9 or 8 points, unless you intended that way <BR>
    <BR>anyway, i really love it, and very nice way to post it, maybe i will follow
    your example <BR> <BR>CG

  body: 'Well, it&#39;s no secret that I personally think we have enough humanist
    sans faces already - but at least this one is innovative in its lively lc. <BR>
    <BR>In the lc, I would say that the &#34;a&#34; is too wide &#40;in both the Roman
    and Italic&#41;, and the &#34;k&#34; needs more life &#40;in the Roman&#41;. I
    like the fact that the UC is more conservative - I think making it as lively as
    the lc would ruin all-UC setting. Speaking of which, I think your smallcaps need
    to be wider. A few secondary things: <BR>1&#41; The ampersand&#39;s head is too
    big. <BR>2&#41; Your stress isn&#39;t actually angled, exactly. It&#39;s more
    like <i>skewed</i> or something... Pretty original &#40;although I&#39;ve seen
    it elsewhere before, even in the work of certain prominent designers - but don&#39;t
    ask me to remember exactly who&#41;, it would be pretty important to see a text
    block in higher resolution. <BR>3&#41; I actually think those &#34;hybrid&#34;
    numerals are very nice - even that wide zero. <BR>4&#41; Those dingbats seem very
    Portugese! Cool. <BR> <BR>Spacing: I think overall it&#39;s good &#40;just some
    specific problems, like the lc &#34;r&#34;&#41;, but the weight you&#39;re showing
    is too light for too much text - it will prevent the tight spacing necessary for
    good readability. Also: the Italic angles seem to waver. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Thank&#39;s for everybody for the comments. Sorry about my late feedback
    but let me organise the answers so: <BR> <BR>1-&#34;the only thing a can said
    at first sight is that i think you shouldn&#39;t be so shy with the ascenders
    and descenders in your lc numbers&#34;.  <BR>You have right about that the figures
    needs more difference &#40;ascenders and descenders&#41; and both versions &#40;old
    style and lining figures&#41;. <BR> <BR>2-The tail of the middle f &#40;regular,
    italic&#41; are functional on small sizes. I didn&#39;t make a  printing test
    &#40;Off-set&#41; until now but on the laser prints they are function normally.
    <BR> <BR>3- &#34;a&#34; is too wide &#40;in both the Roman and Italic&#41;. <BR>On
    my exemple I tryed to create on l/c &#34;a&#34; the same proportion of white space
    &#40;counter&#41; than &#34;n&#34;. But in fact I you are right I compared the
    l/c &#34;a&#34; with others charactes &#40;b,d,n,p&#41; and the forms must be
    more condensed. I started to make the corrections and this characters look&#39;s
    better now, the bitmap looks great. <BR> <BR>4- &#34;I like the fact that the
    UC is more conservative&#34;. <BR>Yes, is better the capitals stayed more conservative
    because the lowercase are a little bit more decorative for a normal sans serif.
    The hooked head terminal on capitals gives swash felling. <BR> <BR>5- I verifyed
    the space of l/c &#34;r&#34; &#40;it&#39;s better&#41; but I think that I must
    open more the finial this letter. <BR> <BR>6- &#34; italic &#34;f&#34; should
    have a subtler descending tail or no tail at all. imho the descenders are getting
    too close to each other in your f-ligatures&#34;.  <BR>I had been thinking if
    I joining the two spurs of the &#34;f&#34;, in fact this way fells strange. Inicially
    I gave the same countes space &#34;ff&#34; like the &#34;n&#34; for a reference
    but its better opean more the forms to brethe and compensate. <BR> <BR>7- The
    mediaval portuguese text that I used in fact was taked from a part of a cover
    book printed by Francisco Correia &#34;Rol dos livros que neste reyno se prohibem&#34;-1564.
    <BR>This kind of portuguese are to strange for me, the words have a spanish influnce

    &#40;what do other people think?&#41;</i> <BR> <BR>It isn&#39;t useful - either
    in a sans or a serif face -  <BR>unless one intends to set &#34;historically&#34;
    with it. <BR> <BR>Of course, it seems more unnatural in a sans than in  <BR>a
    face like, say, Adobe Caslon. As Ricardo had decided  <BR>to use in these samples
    an archaic Portuguese text <BR>that demanded the long-s ligatures, he added them  <BR>for
    the sake of coherence with his material. <BR> <BR>He may well choose not to include

    device.

    to this font to be able to work with this kind of letters and combinations. Normally
    we don&#39;t see sans serif with this stuff but it was Rodolfo that explain and
    corrected me better about this part of the work. In fact on this days we didn&#39;t
    use this kind of letters on portuguese language so they didn&#39;t have application
    on the present but I leave this attention to opean a bridge until to the past.
    I would like too read more ideas and thoughts from more people about this.  <BR>
    <BR>I will try to intergrate better this news letters &#40;vwyx&#41; about the
    forms and space but I think they are fine in this way. If I change the forms will
    broke with all the coherence betten that kind of terminal and the rest of the
    letters. In fact the curves terminations are align by x-height overshoot to make
    a visual compensation. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#34;I&#39;d recommend is making the join
    of the ear to the bowl thinner&#34;. <BR>I made this correction to l/c &#34;g&#34;
    to take a better idea. When I transform &#40;rotate&#41; the l/c &#34;n&#34; to
    take the leg I reduce the thickness of the stroke but I try to mantain all most
    of of the forms to improve the same movemont and tention like the others letters
    with this <BR>hooked head serif. I inclued some different sizes to compare the
    hinting performance. <BR> <BR>Thank&#39;s and Regards &#62; Ricardo <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7043.jpg"

  body: Overall this face is very well done. However, after viewing the three weights
    together I&#39;m left wondering how they would best combine together. For instance,
    the Regular weight appears too close in stroke weight to that of the Bold. Would
    they work together? Or would you use the Light and Bold? Of course you could make
    a Black weight to solve all of this.  This is an obvservation of a GIF so it&#39;s
    entirely possible I&#39;m not getting the right feel. Again, very solid work.

  body: 'Eric, like you said a GIF is not a good reference, but it does seem like
    the Regular and Bold are a bit too close. Not too much, though: I hate the contemporary
    practice of making bolds very dark. Also, having 4 weights is much better than
    having 3 only. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <i>fanstastic</i> work! <BR> <BR>I particularly enjoy the Goudy-esque lc &#39;g&#39;
    and the  <BR>dingbats &#40;which kinda make me giddy&#41;. I would love to  <BR>own

  body: 'Hello every one and thank&#39;s for all the critics. About the differences
    betten the three weigths. I have the same thought like Hrant about the dark bolds.
    But my bold version is very smooth if you compare with other font with the same
    characteristics but it&#39;s visible the contrast if you compared with the regular
    version. I will have attention with this question, problably I will make some
    adjustements to check the result. About the sujection to create another weight
    &#40;Black&#41; are not in my plans for now, problably this ideia will be keep
    to the future if this work will be released. I made some pictures to show better
    the differents betten the Light, Regular and Bold. I will need comments to clarify
    better this situation. <BR> <BR>Plain you said -&#34;except the figures: more
    old style-like please&#34;. You are talking about the fact the descenders strokes
    of the old style figures have a little distance until to the baseline? One more

    <BR>actually, I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re asking here  <BR>either &#40;the
    perils of international discourse&#41;. what I was  <BR>asking for were figures
    that flow more smoothly with  <BR>text &#40;ie, with longer extenders and slightly
    shorter  <BR>bodies&#41;. however, judging by what I can see of them in  <BR>your
    samples, it appears that they flow just fine. I&#39;d like  <BR>more thorough
    text samples with numerals to make a  <BR>final call, but it seems that I rushed
    to judgement.

  body: Hello David it&#39;s a long time ago that we didn&#39;t talk , last time I
    remember that I send to you a e-mail and you never answer me probably that message
    had a error and you never receved. So about the released of this work I don&#39;t
    know yet the period or the date but I think will be finnish until the November
    or Dezember I hope. I had been some problems with my computer recently so I can&#39;t
    continue the corrections. David do you have any comments or critics to this work?  Thank&#39;s
    for encouragement post and see you soon. <BR> <BR>Ricardo

    <BR>e-mail message. It&#39;s possible that the message <BR>didn&#39;t transmit
    well, or I just may have missed it <BR>in my mailbox. If so, I deeply apologize.
    <BR> <BR>I look forward to seeing more progress on this <BR>font as you can post
    it, and I also look forward <BR>to its release. <BR> <BR>The italics ar especially
    nice. I agree with Hrant <BR>and Rudolpho that the cursive-style lower-case <BR>letters
    work better, and keep the spirit of the <BR>rest of the italic set. Other than
    that, I haven&#39;t <BR>noticed any other spots that need any <BR>specific polishing.
    <BR> <BR>Again, congratulations on a fine piece of work! <BR> <BR>Best wishes,
    <BR> <BR>David
