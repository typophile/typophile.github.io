  the client to get away from Bleeding Cowboys...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nMG"

  body: "I agree with Riccard0, can't really give suggestions unless there are more
    specifics.\r\n\r\nI have to say that Bleeding Cowboys doesn't really say \"Theater\"
    to me, at all. As a matter of fact, it's painfully overused for projects in which
    it doesn't belong. Just the day before yesterday I got a political advertisement
    using Bleeding Cowboys. It looked terrible! Granted, local politics never have
    good design departments, but Bleeding Cowboys? For an election brochure? C'mon."

  body: "Ah, sorry, It's a smallish and they operate from what they call a 'studio'
    theater- capacity around 100. They have a number of groups that come to put on
    shows, of all type and genres. To summarise, not big, but could be a lot bigger.
    Also they are involved in shows around the area- so not anchored the the studio.\r\n\r\nThey
    have been going for around 10 years or more, so they aren't needing a major publicity
    campaign. Thanks for helping folks!"

    series is clean, contemporary and offers three flavors (original, sans and slab),
    and is reasonably priced...certainly a step up in \"class\" from Bleeding Cowboys.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, if you really want to be bleeding edge, this freebie will take
    your bruchure to where no studio theater brochure has gone before...\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hrp/now-grotesk/now-grotesk/characters.html"
