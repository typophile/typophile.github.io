  some final feedback for my company's identity before I lock it down for stationary,
  website, etc... I'll hold off on divulging the intended concept so I don't bias
  anyone's feedback. To give some context -- I am an aspiring industrial designer
  and currently work as an interaction designer/photographer. \r\n\r\nAlso, any suggestions
  for additional fonts to include in my short list for collateral would be great.
  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-C\r\n\r\n[[http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3028/3062385932_645b50e94d.jpg|View

    this revision I returned the \"C\" to the original (which adds harmony to the
    \"t\"), changed the ascender of the \"f\" a bit, used the original \"w\" (Avante
    Garde), and toned down the serifs which helped overall. I still don't like the
    k. Honestly this combination of letters looks horrible in just about any typeface.
    Here's a snapshot of the logo with the Avante Garde \"k\" to give an idea of what
    the letterform would look like untouched. Any advice? \r\n\r\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/3069105517_7980c3ea9c_o.jpg\r\n"

  body: "I like the vertical terminal on the bottom of the C on the first logo, like
    the r gets in the way. If the angle on the top of the C matched the r's serif's
    angle, that might complete the idea that the r is blocking out the C, or that
    they share their space more harmoniously.\r\n\r\nI do like the revised w though.
    A little bit lighter on the serifs, and better spaced. But I'd leave a bit of
    a serif on the k."

  body: "thanks for the replies. \r\n\r\n@ Ratbaggy - good point I will try to harmonize
    the geometry. Thanks I'm happy to start to hear at least somebody likes the logotype
    LOL. \r\n\r\n@ jpolo - the only letter to which i added slabs from the original
    typeface is the \"w\". That \"k\" is stock, although I agree that it's just not
    right. like it almost was stuck on. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n@maxticket - creating the
    \"k\" has been terrible -- the original EF Dynamo \"k\" as well as the original
    \"ftw\" relationship are way off very weird negative space going on. To Bert's
    point about leaving the typeface alone, the relationship between those letters
    is a dealbreaker for the stock typeface so something has to be done about them.
    The \"k\" from my original concept was my best attempt at a harmonious serif k
    -- but I think it creates too much of a jagged look and weird direction. I'll
    see if I can harmonize with the new concept. And also I like your point about
    the \"C\" although do you think the descender of the \"t\" will harmonize if it
    loses that relationship?\r\n\r\n"

    the w serifs are so in-your-face that it really calls a lot of attention to itself.

    on speed \u2013 ditch the  non slab-serif stuff. Coming late to this conversation
    and seeing where you started I have this to say: originally there was a forward
    ( left to right) movement of the slab serif. While overboard it's now gone; the
    \"C\" and the \"w\" contain it, and to some extent the \"o\". It now comes to
    a dead halt in the \"r\" and \"k\". \r\n\r\nThe reader must still move forward
    at the end of the word\u2013 it  should be sold to the client as \"forward thinking\"
    yet \"traditional\" - as indicated by the meaning implicit in the word. \r\n\r\nGo
    back somewhat to your original ideas. Best of Luck."

    for another try.\r\n\r\n@Mac_56 I think that you seem to \"get\" what I was going
    for both conceptually and aesthetically. And yes Rockwell was the inspiration
    for the serif letters in the logotype. I would love your feedback on these revisions.
    \r\n\r\nThese revisions look similar to the original concept, but were drafted
    from scratch, with renewed attention to character width, consistency etc.   While
    some have pointed out that the movement of the serif is jagged or confusing, I
    decided to try again with the exaggerated angle, as it's really important to bring
    out conceptual traces of blackletter, chisel work, and calligraphy. Please note
    a new \"k\" which is a nod to Rockwell. It doesn't feel complete yet but it is
    getting close. \r\n\r\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3098596132_b1cf9da7bc_o.jpg\r\n"
