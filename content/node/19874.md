  what is the convention as far as the mark is concerned?  Do I:\r\n\r\na) Include
  the mark, adjusted to the same size as the cap, or\r\n\r\nb) leave it out?\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Bringhurst says put it in, the examples he shows has the mark at a larger
    size than the body text (definitely not the equivalent size of the drop cap),
    and overhanging the lefthand margin if necessary, an \"A for example offers plenty
    of space to include it in the measure.\r\nHe also says that the convention of
    dropping it is a result of the difficulty in setting it in metal and for the reader's
    sake and with the ease of digital setting to keep it in.\r\nSo I think the convention
    (insofar as one exists) is \r\nc) Include the mark, adjusted to suit the cap but
    not necessarily of the same size.\r\nTim"

    you think it\u2019s too big, then you can always reduce the size a bit.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Whoa, it took me <em>longer</em> to write <em>that</em>?\r\nBut yeah, I agree
    with Tim completely. And Robert, too."

  body: You have to include it so people know it's a quote, but it can/should be smaller
    than the drop cap, but bigger than the text size. You'll probably have to play
    with kerning and baseline shift to make it look OK, it should align at top with
    the drop cap. Of course this also necessitates (in Quark) making your drop cap
    2 characters.

  body: "Hey boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen...\r\nI just recently reviewed sample
    specimens of lead caps <em>without opening quotation marks</em> shown in Walter
    Tracy's <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1567922406/sr=8-8/qid=1147363289/ref=sr_1_8/103-3503664-4272636?%5Fencoding=UTF8>Letters
    of Credit</a> (hardbound first edition).*\r\n\r\nI have used cap lead-ins both
    with and without open quotation marks. I personally believe it depends on the
    publication you are working on the and the level of typographic style. As long
    as there are <em>closed quotation marks</em> it is correct.\r\n\r\nHaven't you
    seen long series of sequential quotes as typeset in plays? It was not uncommon
    at the beginning of paragraphs <em>not</em> to use open quotation marks at the
    beginning but use closed quotations only. (Can't get to show samples until tomorrow,
    not near my scanner today)\r\n\r\n* <em>EDIT: Apologies, my poor recollection.
    It was NOT 'Letters of Credit' but was another book I was looking at at the same
    sitting... \"Buddha: Life & Teachings\" published by Peter Pauper Press, illustrations
    by Jeanyee Wong.\r\n\r\nAlso, more apologies... I mistook the chapter opening
    to be the beginning of the quotation by Prince Siddhattha, but there IS an open
    quotation mark within the context of the first paragraph. Guess I should't be
    quick to recall matters of typographic details!</em>"

  body: "I've seen it the other way, Norbert. You often see a quote of many paragraphs.
    There will be starting quotes at each paragraph, but only one ending quote. The
    idea is that the start quotes remind the reader that we are still in a quotation,
    and the only closing quote is needed to completely end it.\r\n\r\n(But I know
    some editors that will make you throw in the additional close quotes.)\r\n\r\nI've
    never seen open quotes omitted, but closed kept. To me that is like closing the
    barn door after the horse gets out."

    discovering that you've been in a barn for the last paragraph, I hate that, it
    interferes with my reading pleasure by destroying continuity and in the meantime
    all the livestock have escaped. Mind you I'm not keen on Don's example either,
    I know I'm in a barn, stop distracting me.\r\nTim"

  body: I think Don is right - the convention is that each paragraph of a long quote
    should have opening quotes but there shouldn't be end quotes until the very end
    of the quotation. It is probably ok to omit opening quotes on every paragraph
    as long as they are clearly at the start of the quote. But to put end quotes on
    every para would be confusing.

  body: "Certainly the classical convention would be to leave the initial quote out;
    I realize that our proud insistence on consistency - say that ten times fast -
    is the reason for the suggestions above ... but really, it looks pretty crummy.
    Ideal situation would be to rewrite the paragraph so that it doesn't begin with
    a quote, but barring that, I'd leave it off. Just my 2\xA2 though.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt

  body: I think you have to let people know they're reading a quote. Another way to
    handle it if you don't want an opening quotemark would be to treat the body of
    the quote in a different way than the text - either italics or indented or a different
    size so it's clear to the reader that it's a quote.

  body: "Just a reminder...\r\nnormal style standards for opening quotations of text
    the same point size is not being debated.\r\n\r\nOnce a large lead-in cap was
    decided on, it's became the typographer's (back in the days when it was an actual
    profession) or designer's obligation to make it work right, whether it was simply
    the first letter of the sentence or a quote.\r\n\r\nMy first inclination was and
    is always to seek one or more reliable references, then decide whether I break
    the rules or not.\r\n\r\nYou can't use the same guidelines for every situation.
    If you are designing a broadside or poster with short text, or if you are laying
    out a five-hundred page book... different situations call for different solutions.\r\n\r\nI
    follow conventions until they make no sense."
