body: "A couple of days ago I watched a documentary on archaeologists digging in Egypt.
  They had pre-printed forms to take notes. Now, take a guess what the pre-printed
  font on those forms was. (hint: If they\u2019d been digging in Switzerland it would
  have been Helvetica.)"

    seen a lot of use on forms and the like in Britain.

    today like it did 200 (?) years ago.\r\nFor the amateur typographer Papyrus does.\r\nArchaeologists
    should know about the egyptian fashion hype in the 19th century but a slab just
    doesn\u2019t look egyptian today."
