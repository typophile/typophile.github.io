  design fundamentals course and have a masters degree in interaction design, but
  I&#39;m looking for more. Right now I&#39;m designing a lot of content-heavy websites
  and web applications, so something more in the information design realm &#40;forms,
  tables, etc., not infographics&#41; would be ideal.  <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? Night
  classes in SF or down the peninsula would be ideal. '
