<p>Well, <strong>he&rsquo;s at it again.</strong></p>
<p>Today he said that we should <strong>never</strong> use justified text because it causes too many rivers. Period. Oh, and nobody did justifed type until this century.</p>
<p>When I countered that Gutenberg used justifed text, he kinda brushed me off saying, &ldquo;yeah, but he had lots of kerning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m better off never taking a class from him again. Yeck.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>never use serif type for the web</strong></p>

<p>He&rsquo;s never heard of H &amp; J&rsquo;s? He&rsquo;s never seen a gorgeous book from Hartley and Marks? Or Hyphen? Or David R. Godine? Does he use Bringhursts Elements? Has he ever seen a book? Has he ever seen a piece of classical literature?</p>
<p>I feel brilliant compared to this guy. Well, your homework should be easy right. Just wipe with a couple pieces of paper, bind them together and put them on his desk, he&rsquo;ll probably praise you as a genius.</p>
<p>This just makes me angry. I&rsquo;ve had a few teachers that talk like they know about things they actually dont, but this guy takes the cake.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d be so kind to your classmates and recommend to them, James Felici&rsquo;s [[Complete Manual of Typography]] and regard anything he says with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>*When you&rsquo;re done with him for good, file a formal complaint with the school, and include TP threads to back you up. * You could learn more from that book in a week.</p>

<p>Ha! That&rsquo;s so funny, because that is EXACTLY what I did for one of his classes! He teaches the web design class at my school, but I had a feeling he was teaching web design circa 1998. I asked him if you could design an entire web page NOT using tables, and he responded, &ldquo;Why would you want to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I went and found the greatest book on web design I&rsquo;ve ever seen, the Head First Guide to XHTML, sat down at Barnes and Nobles for about 8 hours reading almost the whole book, then proceded to prove him wrong by creating a thoroughly modern webpage sans tables.</p>
<p>8 hours at Barnes and Nobles Vs. A Quarter of Web Design? Should have saved my money.</p>
<p>The sad part is that this guy is the advisor for graduating students in the design program.</p>

<p>Ouch. That&rsquo;s exactly why I always tell freshman and sophomore students to never take a Photoshop class and to just buy Classroom in a Book instead.</p>
<p>On a related note, last semester I had a web design class by a first-rate designer/web developer/UI developer. Unfortunately the curriculum he had to teach us had not been updated since HTML 4.0, so most lectures went something like this:</p>
<p>“Ok, open up Dreamweaver and create an X by X table. Now stick the images into it. Now go through the image map tutorial. Once you&rsquo;ve finished this, remember to never, ever design a web site like this. God I hate this curriculum. Whoever put this class together was an idiot.”</p>

<p>I blame the W3C; if XHTML wasn&rsquo;t so obtuse, people who have time to wrap their heads around coding for the web might also have time to teach. Say what you want about tables, I&rsquo;ve never met someone who had more trouble learning tables than DIV tags.

<p>It&rsquo;s vice versa, especially for beginners. A table in a table in a table etc. This brings totally confusing markup. If a beginner tries to keep the layout neat&hellip; there are not much problems with css. Especially if a teacher with profund knowledge in semantic markup and css is on his side.</p>
<p>PS. 
Beginners should use a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; codeeditor instead of Dreamweaver and such.</p>

<p>I was having the hardest time trying to figure out all of the tables and all the extra code, and HOW DO I GET IT TO DO WHAT I WANT IT TO DO. Is that too much to ask for a supposedly WYSIWYG program?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I went and got the book, which not only tells you what to do, it tells you WHY you need to do it. Purely semantic mark-up using XHTML Strict and CSS. Oh, and it teaches you to use TextEdit for all of your coding.</p>
<p>It makes more sense for me as a designer, honestly. I can rough out the entire page by hand in picas like any other design, then the coding is purely spec&rsquo;ing everything out in ems. It&rsquo;s like what I suppose designers had to do way back in the day when they didn&rsquo;t do their own typesetting.</p>
<p>It allows me to focus on what I want to do, rather than what I can do. And, it means that my design will be better because I don&rsquo;t start off on the computer.</p>

<p>Yup. Everywhere I look I see Dreamweaver classes, when the schools should be teaching XHTML/CSS and BBEdit.</p>

<p>XHTML doesn&rsquo;t make that easy to do, at least not without limiting the user to a lot of carefully locked-down templates. This is why I expect Flash to eventually surpass XHTML/CSS: Macromedia was already doing a lot of great stuff with stylesheets, dynamic content, and database connectivity. Once Adobe&rsquo;s engineers have overhauled Flash and Flex to be more user-friendly I expect that Flash will be the solution to everyone&rsquo;s XHTML and browser compatibility woes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Absolutely correct, Dan.</p>
<p>Back in the bad old days (mid-90s), when WYSIWYG web programs were so clunky and code was bloated, everyone on a Mac used BBEdit: I&rsquo;ve since switched to TextEdit, although I admit that when doing tables (where one is needed), I still fire up Dreamweaver and then trim the unnecessary bits out by hand.  :-)</p>

<p>Hmmm, nice use of typographic colour, Mr Gayle. Like it.</p>
<p>Very interesting for me to hear both about syllabuses and experience of WYS (IS NOT) WYG web editor programs.</p>
<p>As I said another time, you should think about studying &lt;a href+&ldquo;<a href="http://www.mediadesign.school.nz/%22%3E">http://www.mediadesign.school.nz/&quot;&gt;</a> elsewhere.</a></p>
<p>As for <em>this guy is the advisor for graduating students in the design program</em> frankly that explains a whole bunch of stuff. Just &lsquo;cos you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s &lsquo;political&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t&hellip; institutions are the same the world over in some senses.</p>
