  a Mac and I'm not;\r\n2) He's using Adobe Indesign, which I don't have;\r\n3) The
  font we're using is Helvetica Narrow, which I don't have; and\r\n4) We're not in
  the same city, so I can't show him directly.\r\n\r\nSo does anybody know if the
  Helvetica Narrow font has a Combining Dot Below, and how can I teach him to implement
  it?"

  body: If Helvetica Narrow does have a combining dot below (he will have to look
    it up in the glyph palette in InDesign), he can just type it before or after the
    letter it goes under, and adjust the kerning between the two glyphs.

  body: He said it didn't appear in the glyph palette. I find that very odd, because
    I have independent confirmation that Helvetica regular <strong>does</strong> have
    the combining dot below. Why would they suddenly leave it out?

    Perhaps it needs a slight squeze."

  body: "He actually already did use a dot from (I believe) Arial Narrow or something
    similar, but the problem is that every time he updates a paragraph's style it
    changes the dot's font back to Helvetica Narrow.\r\n\r\nAs to which Helvetica
    it is, I'm not a font guy (I'm a grammar guy), I don't know, but here's a bit
    of a sample:\r\n\r\nhttp://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a99/Kimpire/helvetica_0001.gif"

  body: "He can create a character style in InDesign and apply it to the dot. Changing
    the paragraph style <em>shouldn't</em> mess up the dot. Though I guess it could..
    Worth a try anyhow!\r\n\r\ngood luck!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.evanmade.com\"

  body: "It sounds like you may have moved beyond input by now, but maybe the following
    will be helpful for future reference:\r\n\r\nWhen I need to help somebody type
    some obscure character sequence, it's usually easiest to e-mail it to them, either
    in the body of the message, or (if their email client doesn't like Unicode) in
    an attachment.  They can then copy and paste as needed.\r\n\r\nBy Unicode convention,
    a combining diacritic should come immediately after the letter it modifies.  If
    you follow that convention, and you happen to be using a font with proper support
    for combining diacritics, the diacritic will properly position itself--no kerning
    required.\r\n\r\nThe Unicode standard includes a number of [[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/unicode/?search=dot+below|pre-composed
    glyphs with dots beneath]].  I don't know if any of these are glyphs you need,
    or if they're included in the font you're using, but it may be worth checking."
