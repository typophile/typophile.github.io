body: "I am happy to announce that after a long period of development, my type family
  Acorde is available for purchase at http://www.willerstorfer.com\r\n\r\nAbout the
  typeface:\r\nAcorde is a reliable workhorse for large, demanding design projects.
  It was designed to be perfectly suited to all different sizes, from small continuous
  text to large headlines and big signage. The typeface\u2019s name is derived from
  \u2018a\u2019 \u2018cor\u2019porate \u2018de\u2019sign typeface, however Acorde
  is not only suitable for corporate design programmes but for information design
  and editorial design purposes as well.\r\n\r\nAcorde\u2019s inception was in early
  2005 as Stefan Willerstorfer\u2019s final project in the \xBBType\u2009and\u2009Media\xAB
  course at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (NL). It is a humanist sans serif
  with noticeable diagonal contrast and shows clear influences of the broad nib pen,
  especially in the Italics. Acorde\u2019s characterful details give it a distinctive
  appearance in large sizes and contribute to its high legibility in small sizes.
  It comes in 14 styles \u2013 seven weights in Roman and Italic each. While the proportions
  of the Regular style were chosen to guarantee optimal legibility without being too
  space consuming, the heavier the weight gets the more suitable it is for headline
  purposes. The heavy weights are relatively narrower than the lighter ones, which
  gives them a strong appearance.\r\n\r\nThe huge character set contains 925 glyphs
  per font and covers a vast range of latin-based languages. Various accented letters,
  small caps, eleven figure-sets, superscript and subscript are all included. OpenType
  features allow for a comfortable use of the large set."

    the legibillity at smaller sizes. Great job!

  body: "Congrats on the release!\r\nSince you intended this to work at so many different
    sizes, I'm curious: did you feel like you were optimizing the spacing for a particular
    (range of) size(s)?"

  body: "Thanks Craig!\r\n\r\nThe spacing closely relates to the proportions of the
    letters (especially to the proportions of their counters). It follows the letters\u2019
    space saving (economical) qualities in the Regular styles. The heavier the weight
    gets the relatively narrower the letters are and so is the spacing.\r\n\r\nAll
    styles can be used without any tracking modification in text sizes. In headline
    sizes and on big signage some minus tracking gives all styles a stronger appearance
    and is therefore recommended."
