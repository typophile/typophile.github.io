body: 'Hello! <BR>I have a big problem with type 1 fonts and OS X 10.3.x &#40;Panther&#41;.
  These are fonts I use already for a long time. I had modified them with Fontographer
  &#40;Euro glyph added for example; changed some glyphs a little&#41;. The Fontographer
  generated fonts already had this problems &#40;only with Panther, nbot before&#41;
  and I bought FontLab some weeks ago with the hope to solve this problem ... but
  it doesn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR>OK - what happens? The fonts look ok on the screen,
  but when printing on any postscript printer &#40;I tried several ones - original
  postscript level 2 printers, harlequin level 3 imagesetter RIP and so on&#41; -
  kerning/spacing is quite wrong; usually the lines get longer &#40;word spacing is
  increased and at the same time charakter spacing seems to be decreased. <BR>Even
  the same character pairs differ in different lines!!! Some are OK, some not &#40;all
  &#34;wrong&#34; ones are wrong in the same way&#41;. <BR> <BR>This happens with
  any software &#40;I tried Freehand MX 11.02, Illustrator CS, InDesign CS, QuarkXPress
  6.1 and so on&#41;, but only under Panther. With Jaguar, everything is OK!!! <BR>
  <BR>And another strange thing: when making a PDF by distilling a PS-file with these
  fonts, everything is also OK and the PDF even prints correctly. <BR> <BR>The only
  thing I didn&#39;t try is if it also happens with non-former-Fontographer-fonts.
  <BR> <BR>And: the same font as TrueType also works, but looks horrible on screen,
  specially in small sizes &#40;no TrueType hinting?&#41;. <BR>I use now the TrueType
  version, but I would prefer the type 1 version because of the screen appearance.
  But I also want to know where this problem comes from - and I would like to be able
  to generate type 1 fonts which work also in Panther! <BR> <BR>And I also tried a
  lot of different settings when generating the font from FontLab 4.6 - nothing helps.
  It is also not an issue of one Mac - I tried it on 3 different Macs - everywhere
  the same. <BR> <BR>Has anyone an idea or is this a known problem with type 1 and
  panther? &#40;I couldn&#39;t find a thread here with this probem.&#41;'
