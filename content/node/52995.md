  cannot find a font similar to the following:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/itsawonderfullife_5538.jpg]\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the poor quality of the image.  I know this must be custom, but I would think
  someone somewhere knows of a font similar to this one before I start working on
  making one from scratch.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!  "
