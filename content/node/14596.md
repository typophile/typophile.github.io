  body: "I downloaded and printed the pdf's...\r\nSome first impressions:\r\n\r\nIn
    general I prefer typefaces with less x-height. In other words: I think the capitals
    are not tall enough compared to the lowercase.\r\n\r\nAlber - the letter forms
    are pleasant and form a comprehensive 'family'. There may be an issue of 'originality';
    it's not very innovative. \r\nMy critique: compared to the other caps the B, D,
    P and R appear a bit too narrow. The a's bowl could be a bit larger. The d's bowl
    is not as regualr as the one of b. The g is unbalanced IMHO - it's 'ear' is too
    slight, the innerspace between the upper and lower bowls is umpleasant. You DO
    need old style numerals! The accents and diacriticals are too heavy. The comma
    is not expressive enough (enlarge the tail!).\r\nIn the progression from Regular
    to Bold the 'quirkiness' of the slanted cut offs is accentuated. I'd prefer some
    differentiation in the angle (that is: the bolder, the less angle).\r\nFont wide
    kerning needs some more attention, esp. the caps/caps!\r\nPlease do not misunderstand
    my critique: I think your Alber is very usable type family and a commendable effort.\r\n\r\nDepot
    \u2013 has an interesting 'feel' to it. It has some of the character of a monoline
    font like DIN, but also some of the humanistic, like Gill Sans. I do find that
    some of the quirkiness it has (eg the shape of M and W and the discrepant leg
    of the lc k) diminishes its value as a potential book face. In other words: longer
    texts could turn out the be irritating.\r\nSome issues I have with single glyphs:
    the k is too 'much' \u2013 it's like it's been transposed from some completely
    different typeface. E and F \u2013 middle stems are not differentiated enough,
    compared to the upper ones. The upper and lower parts of K don't balance well.
    R's tail could use some more swing. I dislike the W a lot - it looks unfinished.
    The lc g's tail could be more expressive. The l is consistently badly kerned!
    It needs more space before a lot of the other letters. My problem with the cap
    W returns with the lc w...\r\nFigures: 4 is not broad enough. 8's crossing bowls
    need some work and the 9 looks uncomfortable. Adding non lining figures is a must!\r\nParagraph
    sign is too thin and flat. Same goes for all the percentage ones,  and the \xA9
    and \xAE. The AE ligature doesn't work for me, I'm afraid. Accents and diacritics
    are a lot better here, compared to Alber.\r\nThe bolder cuts show some problems
    with the inner forms for a and e, I think.\r\n\r\nAnd as a last note, I think
    that both fonts' T's are not balanced. They need a little added to the right (or
    a bit substracted from the left...).\r\n\r\nOn the whole I like Depot better,
    because it has more potential than Alber. I hope this helps. And don't feel intimitated,
    because I am (of course) one of those disgruntled would-be type designers that
    prowl these forums in stead of getting on with their own typedesigns. \r\n"
