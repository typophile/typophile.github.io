body: ' In evaluating a font, it would be nice to have a good test phrase. <BR> <BR>Pangrams
  &#40;like &#34;The quick brown fox ...&#34;&#41; are nice, but they tend to sacrifice
  too much for compactness; a somewhat more elaborate sample text would make evaluation
  much richer. <BR> <BR>So I started thinking about what constitutes a good test phrase,
  and here are the factors which I think need to be balanced against each other: <BR>
  <BR>1. It should be short. <BR> <BR>2. It should show each letter in the middle
  of other letters. This is to facilitate evaluation of spacing, noting that by &#34;propagating&#34;
  the evaluation chances are much better for arriving at a firm conclusion. For example,
  in the word &#34;major&#34;, if the &#34;aj&#34; is loose, you could look at other
  words that have an &#34;a&#42;&#34; &#40;and so on&#41; to figure out where the
  problem is. It&#39;s not water-tight, but it helps. <BR> <BR>3. The letters should
  occur alphabetically &#40;for easy location&#41;. <BR> <BR>4. It shouldn&#39;t necessarily
  have a self-contained coherent meaning, but it should be a &#34;normal&#34; English
  sentence: using words that occur frequently, and no kinky Egyptian sex, please.
  But some awkwardness is probably inevitable. <BR> <BR>5. It should contain some
  extras like: punctuation, quotes, apostrophe&#42;, hyphen, and some special-case
  words like &#34;the&#34;, &#34;I&#34; and &#34;a&#34; &#40;the latter two especially
  helpful in evaluating an italic&#41;. <BR> <BR>6. It should be easy to memorize.
  <BR> <BR>&#42; The most frequent words containing an apostrophe are: &#34;don&#39;t&#34;,
  &#34;it&#39;s&#34;, &#34;I&#39;m&#34;, &#34;that&#39;s&#34;, &#34;I&#39;ll&#34;,
  &#34;couldn&#39;t&#34;, &#34;can&#39;t&#34;, &#34;you&#39;re&#34;. And I think &#34;I&#39;ll&#34;
  provides the biggest spacing challenge. <BR> <BR>In trying to maximize the &#34;normalness&#34;
  of the phrase, I talked to my good friend, Linguistics, and compiled the list of
  the most common &#91;English&#93; words containing each letter &#40;as a middle
  letter&#41;: <BR> <BR>a: that <BR>b: about <BR>c: which <BR>d: made <BR>e: they
  <BR>f: after <BR>g: through <BR>h: the <BR>i: with <BR>j: major <BR>k: like <BR>l:
  all <BR>m: some <BR>n: and <BR>o: for <BR>p: people <BR>q: require <BR>r: are <BR>s:
  these <BR>t: with <BR>u: but <BR>v: have <BR>w: two <BR>x: next <BR>y: system <BR>z:
  size <BR> <BR>Since the more common letters occur in many words, I managed to reduce
  this list down to 16 words. <BR>&#40;BTW, this is where I decided that it should
  be two sentences - that and wanting to put in more puctuation.&#41; &#42;However&#42;,
  in the case of frequent letters, this list was more of a hindrance than a help,
  and it was more effective to just think of common words myself; but for the less
  frequent letters, it helped a lot. <BR> <BR>So, after a good amount of wrestling,
  here&#39;s what I&#39;ve ended up with: <BR> <BR>- <BR>Incredibly, he makes a major
  life-change! For example: '

    quick evaluation &#40;especially of somebody else&#39;s work&#41; is another.
    <BR> <BR>So, is there a compact, non-contrived phrase &#40;or two&#41; where each
    letter is between both a pair of flats and a pair of rounds? That would be a superb

    On the left are words which are difficult to set due to awkward spacing issues.
    On the right are your control letters, that is, letters that generally don&#39;t
    cause trouble. According to Ruder, if your spacing is right, the overall color
    of left vs. right should be equal. If the spacing is too tight, the left would

    It seems pretty cool, especially since it uses many languages. BTW, what&#39;s
    the language in the first column of &#34;Right&#34;, Swedish? I think Spanish
    would be more useful &#40;and an English in each better than a French&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Jared, could you possibly provide a plain-text version? Copy-pasting that
    is bringing forth a mess. <BR> <BR>BTW, two things I worry about: <BR>1. How to
    arrange the parts/words to get a good view of the color? <BR>2. In evaluating
    color across the two sets of words, texture might interfere, noting that the &#34;Left&#34;
    set naturally has a lot of diagonals, descenders, etc.&#42; Add to that the different
    textures that different languages have &#40;like the accents in French&#41;, and
    it gets a bit muddy. I think maybe sticking to one language &#40;at least at a
    time&#41; might be safer. <BR> <BR>&#42; I had to work through an especially thorny
    incarnation of this issue when trying to balance Patria and Nour. I squinted so
    much, I think I got crow&#39;s feet as a result... <BR> <BR>Also: It seems to
    me that the &#34;tight =&#62; left lighter&#34; rule might apply a lot more to
    metal fonts: since digital fonts can easily have gobs of kerning, this isn&#39;t
    necessarily true. What might be a good idea is to disable kerning when doing this
    test, and in addition look at the number of kerning pairs the font has: if the
    non-kerned color is bad, &#42;and&#42; the fonts has an unusually large number
    of pairs, then the basic spacing could be improved. &#40;Come to think of it,
    this kerning issue applies just as much to the metagram idea too.&#41; <BR> <BR>Lastly,
    InDesign&#39;s &#34;optical spacing&#34; feature might be an enjoyable wrench
    to throw in this mix. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    yourself the squinting - step back a respectable distance and see how the overall
