  work. \r\nlike here:\r\n\r\nhttp://drawn.ca/wordpress/wp-content/images/comicspanel.jpg\r\nhttp://www.sparehed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/ware-lambiek00b.jpg\r\nhttp://cartoonbank.com/newyorker/061127on_ware_4.gif\r\n\r\nI
  don't actually need the handwriting look but rather the sans serif style of them.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would you suggest?"

    might be a good alternative, but since they are handlettered you won''t have all
    the irregularities.'

    Highlander]], based on Oz Cooper's lettering, has a certain handlettered quality,
    without the cartoon irregularities.\r\n\r\nBTW, your middle link rejects opening
    the page, so I couldn't see that one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: 'Tnx Chris and Mike. I''m looking for something a bit more modern. Highlander
    looks cool but it has to much of a classic touch. Router is too rounded and has
    less of the slight handwriting allusion that I''m looking for. '
