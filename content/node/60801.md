body: "instructions from fontlab \r\n\r\n\r\nin the paragraph below to import a font
  correctly from illustrator \r\n\r\nStill in Illustrator, select File > New. Set
  the width of the document in\r\npoints to be the double of the UPM size of your
  font (e.g. 2000 pt for a 1000\r\nUPM font). Set the height of the document to be
  the same as UPM size \u2013\r\nDescender (e.g. 1000 \u2013 (\u2013263) = 1263 pt).
  Select Window > Info, View >\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTypically
  TrueType fonts have UPM (Units Per eM \u2013 the size\r\nof the grid on which all
  glyph coordinates are defined) equal to\r\n2048. Type 1 fonts have UPM equal to
  1000. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nto
  clarify here is were im confused \r\n \r\n\r\nSet the width of the document in\r\npoints
  to be the double of the UPM size (mmm ok wot is the upm size is that double the
  size of the grid the font is made on)"

  body: "UPM -- units per measure. So if your units in Illustrator happen to be points,
    use 2 * 1000 points. If they are in mm, use 2 meters (sounds a bit large); and
    if you are a stickler for inches, bring out the extra wide screen.\r\n\r\nI think
    the main point is, you should have a rectangle of twice the font em square in
    units that are convenient to recalculate to 1/1000ths, i.e., for any coordinates
    on your 2000 x 1263 square (in points, mm, or in fuzzwots -- okay I made that
    last one up), you shouldn't bother about fractions of your measurement unit."

    in points so i belive that the \r\nthe ruler measure by points to\r\n\r\nbottom
    of the letterP my descender is = o pts\r\ntop of letter b ascender = \r\n\r\nso
    i measure the height from descender to ascender then double this measurement is
    that correct will that give me \r\nthe upm "

  body: "UPM is generally a function of the desired end font format. As explained
    in your quote above: Postscript/CFF OTF = 1000 upm, TrueType TTF = 2048 upm.\r\n\r\nThese
    values are not absolute requirements, but they are the general working standards.
    You'll need to set your Illustrator document accordingly, then scale your drawings
    to fit the way you want.\r\n\r\nNext time, draw in FontLab to begin with and save
    yourself the headache. Illustrator is not a type design tool."

    this  with help and support from the forums which ur guys are giving me and i
    realy aprreciate ur patience and  ur help  ok ....\r\n\r\n\r\nok back to the task
    \r\n\r\n\r\ni have not a problem setting up a document to points \r\n\r\n700pts
    for a font size  this mean the font is nearly the same size as an a3 document..
    \ that seems extraordinary large, for one  letter\r\n\r\ncos 1 unit in fontlab
    is 1point in illustrator yep ..\r\n\r\n\r\nbut it does match close to the letter
    in the gylph window \r\nwhich are gray in colour.... \r\n\r\nso i think thats
    on the right track \r\n\r\nsee if  thats right , i might be on the right track,
    but if\r\nnot  aggghhh ?? lol\r\n\r\nok "

  body: "The value 700 pts <em>as a physical measurement</em> is only valid in Illustrator,
    because there you have to work with physical measurements. In Fontlab, on the
    other hand, you can only interpret the value \"700\" in one way: 700 units of
    the 1000 (or 2048) em-square.\r\n\r\nWhen working in Illustrator, you don't have
    to worry about the <em>actual</em> size of the character you draw. You only have
    to pay attention to its size relative to the document size, which should have
    em-square like proportions."

  body: "ok when i have imported the letter in and change the x height ,descender
    and ascender to match illustrator guide lines in fontlab the line are in the same
    position it  matches so is that correct then job done for import part.... i have
    not done the width \r\ntho  \r\n\r\nand i used the transform panel to convert
    the letter to 700pts even if it is not necessary in illustrator first.\r\n\r\nand
    the upm is the scaling method for when the type is formatted in postscript ect.\r\n\r\nif
    havent got that correct now.. im dumber than i thought lol"
