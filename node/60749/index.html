		<div class="commentbody">Ok, please take comments with a dose of salt&hellip;I&rsquo;m also a beginner.
A needs a hair less weight on the left diagonal for optical balance with the right side. 
B and C are great. D I think looks heavier on the right than on the left. 
E may be a notch too wide. 
G: I think the bottom corner should move down a bit and I&rsquo;d think about a longer crossbar.
The serifs on I look a bit wide, perhaps that was intentional?
K: the top arm looks heavier than the bottom&hellip;thin it slightly?
The contrast on M looks reversed and it&rsquo;s quite narrow overall.
N normally has a slightly heavier join at the top than at the bottom to keep the weight optically centred.
O and P are lovely.
Q looks narrow (is it the same as O?) and needs more counterspace. The bar needs to move right too, I think.
The leg of R starts a bit too close to the stem and the counterspace underneath it seems oppressed by the counterspace to its right.
S is pretty nice, but may be slightly wide?
V and Y might have the same trouble as A. The right diagonal should be slightly thinner (just a few units)
W: see M.
Did you take some weight off 7? It still looks heavy.
I&rsquo;m not sure about the taper on the hat of 1&hellip;the terminals everywhere else are the same width as the strokes.
Overall this is looking very neat. Nice. :)</div>

<p>Yes, the I is intentionally wide. These letters all go within circles, and it seemed like the I needed to be a little wider than normal to fill up the circle a little more. (I didn&rsquo;t post how these look inside the circles because I wanted the comments to focus on the shape of the letters).</p>
<p>Some of the other width issues (like the narrow M and W) also have to do with these letters going inside of circles. I wanted to give them a little room within the circle. If I ever use these letters as the basis for a normal typeface, I&rsquo;ll definitely need to address those issues. Once I get these letters cleaned up more, I&rsquo;ll post a version showing them within their circles.</p>
<p>I did trim down the 7, but I&rsquo;m thinking that the 7 in the PDF file I posted is not the trimmed down one. I&rsquo;ll look into that.</p>
<p>Good catch on the Q. I thought I had used my most recent O as the basis for the Q, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the S didn&rsquo;t ring any alarms. That&rsquo;s my least favorite character to draw.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean about the contrast of the M being reversed.</p>

<p>Sorry, not very accurate language. I meant that the left diagonal needs to be heavier than the right one for optical balance, and it looked the other way round. I think you&rsquo;ve cracked it anyway now. It&rsquo;s all looking really neat :)</p>
<p>I wonder if you might make the strokes of A slightly slightly narrower near the apex. I&rsquo;m guessing the eye expects the base to be slightly weightier to not look top heavy. It&rsquo;d just be a matter of a couple of units probably and I&rsquo;d open the counter&rsquo;s top to make a tiny trap there to achieve that I think. The crossbar might withstand moving down a tiddly fraction but I&rsquo;m being very picky now!</p>
<p>Right side of P may need to be slightly wider. Compare it next to O and the stroke looks thinner. R possibly too.</p>
<p>D may be slightly wide but my eyes are starting to play tricks from looking at this so minutely. Anyway I think the widths are fixed by the circles you need.</p>
<p>If you want to take this further, set some text and it&rsquo;ll be easier to see any inconsistencies, but it is looking pretty well made as it is.</p>
<p>:)</p>
