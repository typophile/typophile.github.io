  body: Estienne is close, but I don't think that is it. The serifs just don't look
    the same. Thank you anyways.

  body: Ah, that explains the weird X. If you want the same scale as the sample, I'd
    recommend substituting Estienne.

  body: It looks really awful stretched like this. Do use Estienne instead, it's really
    nice.
