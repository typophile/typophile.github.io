body: is there a rule for how high diacritics should come off the glyph which they
  accent? I have been centrally aligning them on the dot of the i &amp; j, but in
  many cases this seems too high? &#40;but i&#39;m not sure&#41;. Could anyone give
  me some advice/help with this one? <BR> <BR>p.s. <b>sputnik</b> &#40;spoot&#39;-neek&#41;
  n. Russian for travel companion; thus i like calling diacritics by this name. there&#39;s
  your trivia for today...

  body: 'I would say there are two forces to consider, and they form the duality at
    the heart of type design: regularity, and readability. In this case the former
    would want your diacritics to align with stuff, like the cap height, ascender
    height, etc. And the latter would want you to eyeball things to balance the whole
    for optimal functionality, irrespective of alignment. The proximity of your font
    to the Display or Text extremes of the &#34;function axis&#34; determines how
    much weight you should give to each force. <BR> <BR>BTW, sorry to ruin your day
    Paul, but &#34;sputnik&#34; is already a reserved term in type: it&#39;s the informal
    name for the generic currency symbol, that circle with the four rays.  :-&#41;

  body: Filip Blazek, if memory serves me well, told me &#40;when looking at a font
    of mine&#41; to align lowercase diacritics with the dot of the i.  <BR> <BR>When
    I look at the results blown up large, it looks too high up but when you look at
    say 10pt text, it looks just as it should. <BR>Logically, the dot of i makes sense
    since it finds a level that already exists and eliminates the jarring sense for
    the eye having to sort out yet another vertical resting place and perhaps the
    fatigue which another level might bring.

    accents for Text should be tighter than for Display, since you want a letter to
    be itself and distinct from other letters &#40;like its non-accented base&#41;
    more than a [compound] form that&#39;s pleasing during deliberative observation.

  body: To me, the diacritics look a bit weak in weight.  The ring looks too small
    to hold up.  Set a paragraph in 10 pint and post a pdf so we can see better.  Hopefully
    Adam or Filip--the REAL EXPERTS--will chime in.  I worked on my diacritics for
    monthsand am still new to it. If you like, you can see my painful progress here

  body: Well, this is a Jannon, so &#34;atmosphere&#34; is quite important, and to
    me it needs to be a bit airy. Your Roman accents are tigher than the italics,
    and at first I was trying to figure out which is more correct, but now I think
    maybe they actually need to be different, and they&#39;re fine the way they are.
    Or I might lower both sets a hair. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: hmmm, i accidentaly put up the italic instead, but this is kinda funny...
    Mathematically... the cap heights, ascender heights, and x-heights are all equal.
    the accents for the roman and the italic are positioned at the same height. however,
    the roman diacritics are considerably lower than the dot of the i and the italic
    diacritics alighn with the dot of the italic i. and yet the italic diacritics
    seem more airy. how odd is that? it&#39;s amazing what a little slant will do...
