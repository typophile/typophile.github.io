  body: "Did you look at the Topaz (I think that's the name) font family at Hoefler
    & Frere-Jones?\r\n\r\nTwo further requests: 1) Please use a more descriptive title
    (you can edit it) to help IDers find posts at a later time. 2) Try to provide
    smaller images. There are shareware graphics applications, like [[http://www.lemkesoft.de/|GraphicConverter]]
    that allow you to change image size, if you don't have any other way to do it.\r\n\r\n-

  body: MIke, I think you mean Ziggurat. Topaz is a sans, but it's too heavy.

  body: "Hi Paul, I thought Topaz was the name of the family, but it was just one
    of the Shades family, which includes Knox, a chiseled face that resembles the
    sample style. You are probably right that Ziggurat is a slab style more like the
    sample letterforms.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
