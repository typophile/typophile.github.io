  body: "eron,\r\n\r\nthanks... tapisserie.(french for needlework). Referring to the
    cap T at the beginning. I'm trying to create something eclectic with blackletter/old
    english forms without strait blackletter in one style. \r\n\r\nThe T bothers me
    a bit. I like the s's, but they look too narrow. So the p is giving you trouble
    too.. hmmm...\r\n\r\nSuggestions welcome...\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: Yeah, I like the s's too. Maybe extend the descender on the p a little bit
    more...but actually the more I look at the p, the less it looks like an n. I agree
    about the T. Maybe adding a vertical line to the T, like capitals in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/neualtisch/">some
    blackletter fonts</a>. Or you could change the form of the a to the single-story
    type.

  body: "Just make that T a little higher (without altering the width of the stems!),
    so that its cross bar is about the thickness of the stems above the x-height.
    Also, make that cross bar go over the lc a.\r\n\r\nIf you use blacletter, you
    should use long-s's.\r\n\r\n\"Tapisserie\" is French, not for needlework (embroidery),
    but for \"tapistry\"/\"tapistries\". "

  body: "Ludwig,\r\n\r\nWell, internet translation bites back. Oh well. I thought
    it sounded an awful lot like tapestry\r\n\r\nI hadn't thought of the long s, but
    my only concern would be lay-men *us audience* ; it's hypothetical usage is a
    knitting/sewing type magazine. It might read Tapifferie. And I'll give your other
    suggestion a shot.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "The i's are bothering me, they have a strange starting point* (and seem a
    bit too tall), the pen would start more in the position of the p and r and are
    a touch too narrow. The ie needs kerning tighter and I would look at some kind
    of decorative ending or flourish to the second e. The Ta ligature is rather attractive,
    but I think you need to do some work to the outside/bottom stroke so the join
    is smooth, there seems to be a flat point between 5 and 6 o\u2019clock.\r\n*anti-chirographic\r\nTim"

  body: It looks pretty cool, but would it really say "needlepoint" to the intended
    audience (ignoring for the moment the translation problem)? I'm no needlepoint
    expert, but I'm not sure that it would. It feels kind of liturgical to me.

  body: "Tim:\r\n\r\nThe stems of the p and r thin you mean? Any other form of i you
    might suggest, because i started with a stereotypical blackletter lc i, but it
    didnt really fit. I'll look into the optical height of the i.\r\n\r\nMark:\r\n\r\nI
    was going for a more 'fringe' audience, ala late 20's to 40's, designerish types
    who like to be crafty on the side. (that's why I didn't do something more literal)\r\n\r\nThis
    is why i don't like hypothetical work, becuase I can change my audience. ( anyway,
    this area of mag masthead design is hidiously drab, why not spice it up )\r\n\r\nIs
    it the just the blackletter making it feel liturgical? Any ideas otherwise? Maybe
    a way to keep it's character while making it less liturgical?\r\n\r\nKen:\r\n\r\nme
    too"
