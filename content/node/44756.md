  used for logo? Meaning address, phone, website copy. \r\n\r\nAny recommendations
  on current fav book on typography?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "I'd say that it rather depends on what type the logo is set in. If your logo
    is say ...<em>yawn</em>...  Helvetica, you are probably ok to set the other text
    in it. Anything with a bit more character may lead you into criminality. In general
    though, it's probably best to find a complimentary face to set the other bits
    in. If it's the typeface that the actual letter writers will eventually set their
    words in you'll possibly achieve even greater harmony. Or, at the very least you
    won't have three typefaces on the one document.\r\n\r\nWhat typeface is the logo
    set in?"

  body: "Keen to know what typeface it is in.\r\n\r\nIf its a plain and less decorative
    one then yes absolutely fine, the typeface becomes part of the company's identity.
    \r\n\r\nCreates consistency too. "
