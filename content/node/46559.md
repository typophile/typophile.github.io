  body: "Speaking for myself, and with no guarantee of well-thought rationality, what
    bothers me about the sample is its overhinting and the resulting damage to the
    letterforms and spacing, especially in the smaller size. Windows loves torturing
    letterforms like this, trading fidelity to form and spacing for an eerie oversharpness.\r\n\r\nMore
    subjectively, the caps seem too narrow, the descenders too long, and the spacing
    too loose and inconsistent. It seems like a font that had to conform to some earlier
    bitmap font, maybe, and suffered for it. Faux bolding and/or squooshing could
    also play a role."
