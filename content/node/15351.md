  body: Are you talking about the buttons across the top of the sites? I figured they
    were just part of a template or something. But web design, in general, is pretty
    rife with "code-copying." It's the nature of the medium, I think.

    is when it gets painful on a bike.\r\n\r\nBut it really doesn't follow that one
    site copied the other just because it has a gradated background and dropdown menus,
    it looks pretty generic to me.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I agree with timid. There is a definite difference betrween being inspired
    by, and stealing, a design. This example is clearly not theft in any sense. It
    is VERY common in the design world to look to other's work for inspiration. For
    good designers, this usually sparks avenues of ideas that lead to a finished product
    that bears little or no resemblance to the work that gave them their inspiration.
    For less experienced designers, it may lead to solutions like the example you
    show above, but it still isn't theft.\r\n\r\nWhat does equate to theft, for me,
    is direct copying, with very subtle changes. I once was browsing an HTML template
    site that sells prepared site templates (don't ask!), and what I saw there appalled
    me. They had directly copied the site of a well-known Florida-based interactive
    design firm, changing only the headline copy. What's worse, they were selling
    it as their own work. Of course I promptly emailed the firm regarding this."

  body: I haven't got a current copy, but is it possible that the motor bike site  was
    made with some kind of Macromedia Dreamweaver template?

  body: "I agree with Joe.  There's too many similarities to attribute it simply to
    inspiration.  This is more than inspiration, since almost every design element
    on the Macromedia site was copied.  There's the navigation, sub navigation, placement
    of logo, rounded corners, and gradient background.\r\n\r\nIf you only used a couple
    of these elements in your own design and developed it further, that'd be fine...
    but when you take all of the design elements including the color scheme, I'd say
    that's theft even if you don't copy the code."

    web design, and uses this product on their own site. The nerve of these Macromedia
    customers - using the product they paid for for its intended purpose!\r\n\r\n:-)"

    article about design theft in their july/august issue.\r\n\r\nOne quote to get
    the brain goin:\r\n\r\n\"Creations patterned after others' work are clearly not
    plagiarism if, like in footnoted writing, the original that they are modeled after
    is declared.\"\r\n\r\nAlso..as the STEP article brings up...\r\nIs it Quotation?
    Appropriation? Homage? Parody?\r\nThe bike site doesn't fall under any of those
    categories.\r\n\r\nWhat if the client had said, \"We want this to look like that
    Macromedia site.\" Would you do it?\r\n\r\n"

    couldn't create something that looks very similar without seeing the original.
    The blocks of information are laid out in a logical way; name, contact details,
    content menus, content, against a neutral gradated background with embossed menu
    bar.\r\nTim"
