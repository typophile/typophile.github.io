  | Myfonts.com]] and on [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/gatf/spargo | Fontspring]].\r\n\r\nSpargo
  is inspired by 20s and 30s American typefaces, often seen on share certificates
  and other securities.  We thought it was time to bring a touch of transatlantic
  boom and ebullience to our portfolio of typefaces, not to mention a healthy dose
  of Roaring 20s spirit. Spargo is the result, offered in six all capitals display
  typefaces. \r\n\r\nHere are speciments of the six faces...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spargo_Gallery1_4437.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spargo_Gallery2_5267.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spargo_Gallery3_6281.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spargo_Gallery4_5180.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spargo_Gallery5_5060.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spargo_Gallery6_3843.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the overall feeling. But A's smoothness seems out of place compared
    to the angularity of other letters.\r\nAlso R and especially s are too wide."

  body: I would'nt say that the A is out of place, if I look at the bottom right of
    the Z, the tail of the Q, the top right of the V or the X. However It would have
    been probably a good idea to use the same smoothness on the tail of the R. Nice
    work!
