  in Photoshop recreating a number of classic movie posters \u2013 for my own enjoyment
  and (due to copyright issues) not for profit.  It\u2019s a  relaxing hobby, which
  so far has been free to indulge in.\r\n\r\nNow to business\u2026\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  attached a font (below) which I\u2019m having problems finding?  Some please HELP!!!
  \ It\u2019s from a science fiction movie poster, This Island Earth.\r\n\r\nI also
  need a few fonts but I\u2019m loathed to pay top dollar for Franklin Gothic or Grotesque
  No9.  Can anyone recommend a website where I can download these for free or suggest
  an alternative (generic) font or two?  I\u2019m using a Mac!!!\r\n\r\nHope someone
  can help?\r\n\r\nBest Wishes\r\n\r\nPhil Rhodes (Hull \u2013 England)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/F2_6507.jpg]"

    very inexpensive at $19.95 US\r\n\r\nYou can find free fonts at sites like DAFont,
    but the quality is very inconsistent\r\nfrom one font to the next. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
