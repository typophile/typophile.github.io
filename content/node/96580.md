  loon. We have collaborated on and off for the past thirty years or so on a number
  of minor film projects, on a variety of important subjects. Basically, I get a lot
  of creative freedom, designing the promotional material, and he promises to pay
  me, but never does. Which is cool, I suppose. Like I have a choice.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
  he's got a new project in the works on the subject of alcohol-free Texas redneck
  rock\u2026or something to that effect. The working title is <strong>RENEGADE HEARTS
  AND HONK-TONK NIGHTS</strong>, and here are a few clips\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qka-WjP1KBs&feature=plcp\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_CN48ZCYMY&feature=plcp\r\n\r\nAnyone
  up for designing a logo and promotional material for no pay? At present, I just
  have a little too much on my plate to devote the time and attention necessary. Of
  course, any Nick's Fonts you might need for the project would be on the house. Let
  me know\u2026"

  body: The portfolio of a web site development company matters a lot. This is what
    shows what the professionals are capable of when it comes to the web design service.
    A reputable firm will have a record of past completed projects. Take time to go
    through the portfolio. This will help in validating claims. The portfolio of a
    dependable company is that which shows competence in designing as well as an understanding
    in the importance of content. Look at how they blend the colors, designs as well
    as the features they add to make a website exceptional. The best method to use
    in countering the competence of a firm is to compare its portfolio with that of
    other firms.

  body: "In one of the last public interviews Johnny Cash ever gave was with the King
    ... Larry King. Cash was asked who was the greatest country singer ... Cash said
    without hesitation ...Dwight Yoakam. \r\n\r\nI own pretty much near everything
    Yoakam has put out including his most remarkable 4 CD collection Reprise Please.\r\n\r\nThis
    guy is 100% pure honky tonk country ... and also does an amazing job putting his
    style on any cover his has ever done ... Suspicious Minds is one of my favs for
    sure.  Songs like Thinking About Leaving, Bury Me, Two Doors Down, Love caught
    up to me, etc., etc.. ... I really can't express strong enough how this guy IS
    country and Honky Tonk ... old skool & nu skool too!!\r\n\r\nAt the heart of most
    every pure honky tonk / country song is a heart felt sense of humor... an incredible
    wit, a twist of phrase, a chord progression, even right down to the threads they
    wear Buck Owens as an example ... Dwight Yoakam is all of that too!\r\n\r\nDwight
    Yoakam is a national treasure ... nuff said.\r\n\r\nAs for my most awesome honky
    tonk graphic ... sorry but a day later on I still think it's awesome but even
    more so :)))\r\n\r\nGreat linkage!! Thanks :)\r\n\r\nn.  \r\n\r\n  "
