body: "Hello everyone!\r\n\r\nWalpurga is a witchy display font that comes in two
  variants - regular & bold - and with four glyphs for each letter. There is a set
  of ornaments and the in-built open type features produce a random, natural looking
  effect when activated through the \u201Ccontextual alternates\u201D feature. Walpurga
  was created with stylized brush ends that become visible at larger font sizes.\r\nHope
  you enjoy!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Walpurga_poster_6431.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Walpurga_poster2_4267.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Walpurga_poster6_5651.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Walpurga_poster7_5486.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Walpurga_poster8_6603.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Walpurga_poster10_4958.jpg]\r\n\r\nAvailable
