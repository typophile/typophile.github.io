  body: "Thanks, Lex. When I try \"Insert image,\" I get \"Could not copy image. Error\"\r\n\r\nThe
    image is a 104 KB grayscale jpg, 600 pixels wide.\r\n\r\nI noticed someone else
    having this problem as well. Tried Safari and Camino, so I don't think it's a
    browser prob."

    to see if you can get it accepted. \r\n\r\nAlso, in the future, you can Edit your
    post to try to add to it, rather than start a duplicate thread. Otherwise we don't
    know which one to answer, (like the way I just responded to the other one).\r\n\r\n-

    and got an error, which is why I tried a new thread. No luck with a gif either.
    Hrmph."
