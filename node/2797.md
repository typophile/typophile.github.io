    practice. <BR> <BR>BTW, Chinese is written in both vertical and horizontal, although
    the latter is more prominent now. I don&#39;t think Japanese is written vertically,
    at least not in the mainstream. Another interesting vertical language in Mongolian,
    which used to be written in Cyrillic, but recently switched back to their original
    script, which looks somewhat similar to Arabic, interestingly enough. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    Photoshop because it works very similar.  I just got Photoshop a few weeks ago
    &#40;version 6, not the latest&#41;, so maybe I&#39;m missing this Unicode font
    ability, but I can&#39;t even see the font title in the list of available fonts.   <BR>
    <BR>  As far as viewing the characters, I can&#39;t see any of the Chinese fonts
    I installed with ANY application- not my font viewer applications, not Word, PSP,
    nothing.  I DO have Photoshop installed for some special functions, but even with
    that app when I try browsing fonts I can&#39;t see the font names of the new ones
    I have installed, because Windows doesn&#39;t know what to make of the non-english
    font characters.  So far the suggestions I&#39;ve gotten are: <BR> <BR>  ~Do a
    &#34;Windows Update&#34; and download Japanese and Chinese language packs <BR>
    <BR>  ~Change my Region settings to Chinese. <BR> <BR>  I&#39;m nervous about
    both these solutions however, as I don&#39;t want to inadvertantly change my core
    display properties to Chinese, thereby making my PC unusable.  Am I making any
    sense here? '

    read your other posts and I can tell you REALLY know your stuff when it comes
    to fonts.  All &#42;I&#42; know coming at this from a graphics person is &#34;Launch
    graphics app... select text tool... pick an installed font... start manipulating&#34;,
    so I don&#39;t know what needs to be installed in the OS to support the kanji
    fonts. <BR> <BR>  So what you&#39;re saying is that downloading the japanese/chinese
    will ONLY install the background support files for that particular language, thereby
    making the chinese fonts I installed usable? <BR> <BR>  In case it matters, the
    fonts I&#39;m trying to use are from this site:  <A HREF="http://www.4gee.com/font/pages/fonthtml/chinese.htm"
