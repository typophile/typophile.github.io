  are they spaced? In some fonts they have all the same width (Myriad) and in others
  they have their own width (Thesis). Whats the correct way or what are the different
  \"philosophies\" behind these two ways of spacing? Is there any rules to that or
  does it not even matter, since accents are hardly ever used by themselfes anyway.
  \r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions.\r\n\r\nHenning"

    question answers itself. As far as spacing of accents when used in composite characters,
    what I can gather of the prevailing wisdom is that accents should be centered
    horizontally over the letter, and vertically with each other. Although horizontal
    centering <em>usually</em> looks fine with breve, caron, circumlex, dieresis,
    dot, macron, ring and tilde accents, I usually fudge acute accents to the left
    and grave accents to the right (top row). And \"usual\" horizontal centering doesn't
    work when the optical center (bottom row) of the character doesn't line up with
    the geometrical center (middle row).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/accents_5279.gif]"

  body: "You can make the regular accents in a font either fixed-width or variable.\r\nAs
    you say, they aren't used for anything, unless a typographer wants to play with
    the position of an accent by kerning (or do some heavy-metal umlauting), in which
    case the width is irrelevant.\r\nActually, they do appear in type specimens, so
    design them to look good there!\r\n\r\n"

  body: John is talking about combining accents, which are an alternate set of characters
    which have different Unicode from the regular accents in the basic encodings.

    a keyboard that has some of the less-used combining diacritics (like combining
    small-e, etc) to test it, but someone might already know for sure.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you type with a keyboard on OS X that has dead keys, that is, most European keyboards,
    when you type a deadkey, the accent is highlighted in peach wtih the diacritic
    to be added in it.  The spacing within the marks is afaik based on the spacing
    as given in the font.  So in monospaced fonts, it's always the same width, but
    in other fonts, it will have varying width.  I do know that the ^ is based on
    the ascii caret, but like I said, for some of the others I'd need to make a test
    keyboard to be absolutely certain which letters it gets from the standalones and
    which it gets from the combining ones.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea
