body: Somwhere back in the late 90&#39;s while I was typesetting at a small print
  shop I happened across Squirt Gun Fonts. They produced Crass &#40;a stencil looking
  font&#41; and Rez. These ring any bells? They were part of the Swank Army? <BR>
  <BR>Anyone know what happened and/or where I might find the Squirt Gun font library
  now?
