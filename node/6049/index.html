<div class=commentbody>speaking as a layperson i think most average joes (at least here in the states) associate "European" with the clean, cool, modern Swiss and Scandinavian styles. <br> <br><i>coz im asked to design some types that trend to the European style</i> <br>i guess you really should ask your client what he/she thinks "European" means. probe him/her for a bit more iformation than just "European style"</div>

<div class=commentbody>Don't be such Modernists, guys. Lynn's question is... <i>real</i>. It doesn't have a answer like "1 + 1 = 2" but there's a fuzzy reality there, and if we think objectively and pragmatically, we can help. She's probably looking for trends, not The Answer. <br> <br>Look at the fonts in tipoGrafica #60. As a group, they're turn-of-the-century (I mean this last one) South American. Look at the stuff in FontFont: as a group, they're very European. Look at Emigre: they're highly Californian. <br> <br>It's somewhat hard to imagine FF Signa for example being designed outside of Northern Europe. Yes, it's not impossible, but the <i>trend</i> is there. Otherwise we wouldn't have differences in culture around the globe. And it would be hard to imagine some of Martinez Meave's fonts being designed outside even <i>Mexico</i>, not even the broader Latin America. And then look at Franklin Gothic, then look at Univers. <br> <br>Don't be afraid of tangible -if hazy- variance. To paraphrase Jerome Peignot: let's celebrate our differences. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I usually feel awkward when these discussions appear because they tend to go all stereotypical when it comes to what a country 'is' and what it represents. Has anyone an idea of what goes on in Scandinavia? <br>Have you visited the design schools graduate shows? And compared it to what happens in London, Paris, Tokyo or Ulaanbaatar for that matter? <br> <br>If you did... You'd be surprised. <br> <br>And Hrant, would you elaborate the north european aspects of FF Signa? <br> <br>I'm curious. You usually have an interesting way of presenting your ideas, although from reading several of your posts I suspect you're actually a closet modernist... ; ) <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Tankard's Bliss strikes me as very British (yes, I know he is British). It could be that it is because I see a little Gill Sans in there. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Fredrik, it certainly is "dangerous". And if I try to nail down why Signa looks Northern European, I would probably have to resort to formal descriptions, and maybe that goes against the "atmospheric" point of all this? Dunno. <br> <br>Feelings are subjective, unreliable, etc. but they're also <i>real</i>. And it makes sense to me that groups of people who share things (like a country) would often express themselves in certain patterns. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>On the other hand...</i> <br>If a typeface is widely exposed, during a long time (like Johnstons London Underground) you might feel it becomes part of a city, or a country. <br>Bliss, yes I do feel it's english typographic roots, but I also feel it's a bit swedish beacuse it's frequently used by the biggest mobile operator in the country (maybe Scandinavia as well, it's Telia). <br> <br>When i see FF Signa I see something danish, actually. <br>Because of danish type tradition, from Knud V Engelhardt to DSB (Danish State Railways) corporate identity and typeface, designed by danish design agency Kontrapunkt. And the DSB type is displayed everywhere you travel (in Denmark). <br>So there's a style associated with Denmark, but I wonder, how close is a country's <i>visual</i> identity to it's soul? If countries have souls, that is. Or a whole bunch together like Europe for that matter. <br>I'm sceptical... <br> <br>I'll end this post as I noticed Alessandro did on another thread with a verse from a song. <br>From <i>Cold Swedish Winter</i> by Jens Lekman: <br> <br><i>When people think of Sweden i think they get the wrong idea, <br>Like Cliff Richard who thought it was just porn and gonorrhea; <br>and Lou Reed said in the film</i> Blue in the face <br><i>that compared to New York City Sweden was a scary place. <br>They seemed to have a point after meeting with this girl... <br>maybe not Cliff Richard, but Lou had surely met her.</i> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm so in love with the DSB typeface. I cannot imagine it coming from anywhere else, it's so close to DK's soul. <br>I touched on designing for a country's soul in an earlier post. it might be relavant Lynn.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mea culpa. I can't keep up with you youngsters and the zillion computer faces you refer to. When I was setting type on Berthold equipment, I thought that their Concorde was a very classy face with a European flavor. Any of the Gill family say the London Tube stations and markings. Akzidenz Grotesk and Microgramma are other sans serifs. Clarendon and C. Bold were very common in Switzerland, though it's American in style. Hope this helps. <br>PG <br><a href=http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/ target=_blank>http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/</a></div>
