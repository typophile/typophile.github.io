body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nMy <a href=\"http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html\">Inconsolata</a>
  feels just about finished now. I've added more or less all the characters requested,
  so that the basic Latin-1, -2, and -0 should be covered, as well as some other glyphs
  needed for TeX.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like now is critique of the fit and polish of the
  font. I'd especially like feedback on the accents and auxiliary characters, since
  I don't use those as much. I tried to follow the advice of Adam Twardoch and Briem,
  but not speaking Icelandic or Polish, it's hard for me to know how successful I
  have been. The font is available for downloading in various formats, so it should
  be pretty easy to use.\r\n\r\nHinting is very minimal. That means the rendering
  won't be super-sharp, but at least I have confidence that the shapes won't be horribly
  distorted, and it looks pretty nice in Linux on my 24\" Dell monitor.\r\n\r\nBefore
  people lay into it, I know the \"A\" is stylistically a little out of step with
  other glyphs such as \"V\". But I can't bring myself to let go of it. I like the
  little touch of Eagle mixed in with all the other eclectic influences.\r\n\r\nThanks
  much in advance (width)."

  body: i like this quite a lot. what i like best is that it doesn't feel like a monowidth
    font when reading it. excellent! I find the sharp apex of the A distracting. Are
    those spurs in places supposed to be there? they feel a bit like they're there
    on mistake; I like them, but the seem inconsistent. Some of the accents (acute,
    grave and the lc caron) feel dimuitive to me. I think you did a good job on the
    eth, but i'm not a native Icelandic reader. Also, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/uppercase.htm">the
    capital Eng</a> is the preferred shape for Hausa, but not for Sami (if that's
    important). more later...

  body: "Wow...I'm really impressed. This is really pleasant, and with the details
    on letters like g, t, and v it even approaches friendly.\r\n\r\nI agree with Paul
    that I don't understand the logic behind the inconsistent use of the microserifs,
    especially in the uppercase (why on the top of the H but not the bottom? why on
    the lower arm of the Z but not the L? etc). I also think that the microserif on
    the r should be a little more blunt (like on the s). \r\n\r\nWhile I'm on the
    lc r, I would think again about removing the foot serif that I saw in Xavier Noria's
    screenshot; I kind of liked it and it helped fill in the whitespace a little bit.
    On the other hand, I understand your desire to keep it as sans-y as possible.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Is there a way to translate the subtle curvature of the lowercase diagonals to
    their uppercase counterparts to soften them up just a bit?\r\n\r\nI admire how
    you've paid attention to how this looks in various programming languages on screen,
    and not just in natural langauges on paper.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: If this is used for programming primarily, then now it looks on screen at
    the sizes programmers use will be of key importance. Have you tested how well
    it works under the situations where your intended audience reads and writes?

  body: the cedillas on the s and t are tolerable, but i believe in most instances
    the <a href="http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=9">comma accent</a> is preferred.

  body: "I'd very much like to try programming using this font for a few days.  You
    should release it.\r\n\r\nI agree with Sergej - your A is too pointy.  And if
    I were you, i'd try and see how the curve in 'v' and 'w' looked on 'x', 'y', 'k'
    and maybe 'z' too.  And the curve in the 't' is great."
