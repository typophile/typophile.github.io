  All over their website is a sans serif that I find really beatiful, and I'm curious
  about what it's called. I've tried both Identifont and WhatTheFont to no avail.
  See the website for plenty of examples in different weights, or the attached screenshot
  that I made from a zoomed in Flash-file on the website. Thank you for your time!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.avid.com/US/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avidsansserif_3986.png]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  Oops, put it in the wrong forum... should be fixed now."
