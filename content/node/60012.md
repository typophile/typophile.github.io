body: "Road trips usually sound fun at first thought. After the first couple hours
  they can stop being so fun. However, on a recent day trip from Baltimore to Chicago,
  \ I took notice of a certain type/branding culture that I usually ignore. It's not
  elegant by any means, in fact it's often a dirty, weathered and peeling culture.
  \r\n\r\nFreight trucking is a bold and sleepless industry, one full of grizzled
  men and gun-slinging Yosemite Sams. And with tough attitudes, we expect tough branding.
  Maybe. As irrelevant as each truck feels from the next, certain brands come with
  not-so-bad typography. Now, the images I am sharing are by no means beautiful; honestly,
  they each feel dated and exist outside of any significant design circle.\r\n\r\nWith
  that said, how many times have you pantomimed a trucker's gesture in hopes of a
  blaring horn salute in return? In the same small way that truckers are not so tough
  after all, it is possible that the branding might also contain evidence of class,
  or at least individual pride. Again, just an observation, but here are a few samples
  mostly from the Ohio Interstate.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/40_4157.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/30_4457.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/36_3472.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/31_3978.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\n\u2014\r\nAfter
  a little while I noticed that some - not all - start to show signs of water or wind
  as metaphors of transportation. Which is interesting because I can't think of anything
  less elegant and weightless than an 18-wheeled MACK truck. \r\n\r\nI admire the
  heritage that comes along with a lot of trucking companies. The unchanged logos
  and the old fashioned icons ring out, trip  after trip. Why should they change?
  After all, this industry isn't exactly consumer. Companies need a dependable driver
  in a dependable truck, so the incentive to hold on to an identity that works must
  be very important to an corporate owner when it comes to his fleet.  \r\n<br/>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/47_3598.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/48_4257.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/29_6649.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\n\u2014\r\nBut
  of course I'm going to end with some black letter! Even if it doesn't make sense
  in it's context, I will find a way to see the beauty in any black letter presentation.
  Actually, this was the truck that caught my attention right from the beginning.
  The first thing I questioned was \"what will black letter lend to the value of this
  particular brand?\" I suppose a related topic to discuss would be the biker scene
  of America. "
