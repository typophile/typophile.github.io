  mainly for headlines and shorter texts.\r\n\r\nI need:\r\n\r\n- upper and lowercase\r\n-
  italics\r\n- A few weights would be nice\r\n- the ability to use as a webfont.\r\n\r\nI've
  been using this as a \"placeholder\" for now:\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nMads\r\n\r\n"

    after all.\r\nThe present vogue for this style strikes me as very retro."

    Together:\r\nhttp://www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic\r\n\r\nIt's expensive
    but I'll tell you, it works hard for its money. Mind you, if you're only doing
    headlines the whole family might be overkill. I'm finding the narrow and regular
    to work very well at small sizes.\r\n\r\nThe oblique hasn't yet made it to myfonts.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nTablet
    Gothic isn't as straight-sided as your example typeface. But that's one of the
    things that actually makes it versatile. \r\n\r\nEDITx2:\r\nMaybe you're looking
    for a free font. Sorry, if that's the case. Don't steal."
