body: "Hello everyone.\r\nI need to ask for information regarding a particular font
  and its designer. On a recent thread posted on the WhatTheFont forum, a user called
  AVPatch (also a member here) was kind enough to provide me with a little information
  about a typeface I have long sought after.  \r\nThe font is called NewCompact, and
  was designed by David C. Saunders, circa 1989. It was, from what I understand, privately
  distributed by the designer as a family of four Postscript fonts for the Apple Mac.
  The family consisted of a regular, oblique, extended and extended oblique. The obliques
  and extended versions were only available when paid for, whereas the regular was
  freely distributed via the internet as (what I assume was) shareware. I am unable
  to dig up any information or specimens of the obliques and extended versions, so
  I feel this forum might be the best place to ask. Does anybody know anything about
  the fonts and their designer? I know a David Saunders co-designed the Monotype font
  Columbus in the early 1990s, but could he be the same person that designed NewCompact?\r\nThank
  you in advance!"
