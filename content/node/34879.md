    the site several years ago, and didn't join right away because I thought it was
    paid only (and at that time money and food were a bit more closely connected in
    my life).\r\n\r\nNow that I can, I will pay my share, but I like the idea that
    there is no distinction between those who have, and those who cannot (or will
    not, I suppose). Or if there is a distinction, let it be on the profile page or
    somewhere, and not on the forums."

    believe the RSS of thread posts was purposely delayed when the forum was just
    back online the first time. I'm not sure if it still is after it came back online
    the second time, with the new hosting package, though.\r\n\r\nIt looks like it,
    sometimes a lot of new posts show up in my reader, other times only sporadically,
    eventhough there are new threads."
