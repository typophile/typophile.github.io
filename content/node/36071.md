  a book-cover blurb in 9.5/14.5 Didot --> black on tan. It looks OK on screen but
  I realise that this face has very fine features so perhaps with the CMYK process
  the end result will be muddy.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on whether using such a fine font
  on a coloured background will produce problems?\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n\r\n--N"

    would have designers believe. Just make sure to work with a capable printer and
    pull good proofs."

    perhaps it's to do with the great costs involved and the myriad of things that
    can go wrong\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Stephen,\r\n\r\nIt's the Linotype Didot/regular. <cite>Why Didot instead
    of Bodoni?</cite> good question to which I don't have a very satisfying answer,
    I guess Didot was closer then Bodoni, I liked the effect so I went with it. To
    my mind because the faces are quite similar, the same question re. CMYK muddiness
    could be equally applied. Couldn't you also say why Bodoni instead of Didot? What
    am I missing? Is Bodoni an obviously superior face or is just that Bodoni seems
    to have less contrast and so thicker thins?\r\ncheers"

  body: Yes, less contrast. Better for text. In fact, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/itc_bodoni_twelve/">ITC
    Bodoni Twelve</a> would be the best choice here, but any Bodoni will be less risky
    than Lino's Didot.
