    but I think it's hand-done, not a font.

  body: Thank you Ryuk, but I'm still hoping that this could be a font. I would like
    to use it personally.

  body: "<blockquote>noticed the d's are the same</blockquote>\r\nActually not, to
    my eyes at least (counter shape, ascender boucle counter...). Differences are
    subtle but to me they're different letters. But even assuming they're different
    doesn't mean for sure it's not a font. Many modern typefaces (like Bombshell)
    offers many alternates and ligatures through OpenType features. \r\nStroke thickness
    is also variable and connections are flawless. That's mainly why I think it's
    hand-done. But I could be wrong. People at WhatTheFont Forum appear to have the
    same opinion: '[[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=birchbox|Birchbox]]'"
