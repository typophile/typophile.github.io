    average amateur techno font -- it actually shows some design skills. I thought
    I should search commercial sites, and so far struck out at MyFonts. Moving on
    to Veer...\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    If this is not a commercial font, I think I will be quite surprised, but I am

  body: "yeah, i guess worst case ill trace it, but id like to know the font... i
    like it too! have you guys had any luck with font recognition programs? im looking
    at an app called fontmatch and imagaro professional z which both claim to match
    a given font. fontmatch will match typefaces on your computer as will imagaro,
    but imagaro also will search something like 70k commercial fonts available online,
    i guess same type of functionality as whatthefont.\r\n\r\ni really appreciate
    the help guys. i wish i had an eye for fonts like you!"

    tweak the font?!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fec119756a2276e91acbdb3b5886dc_3473.gif]"

    There are other variations which may have been mixed in.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
