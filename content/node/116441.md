  this is, Lucida Console gets me close but I'm trying to replicate the Cassette insert.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2kwn_6588.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  where it says Foo Fighters is a font that I think I've seen but don't remember,
  I need to do some more digging on my own for this one, but if someone can identify
  it easily that'd be great. Assuming the small text on this one is simply Sans, if
  I'm wrong feel free to correct. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
