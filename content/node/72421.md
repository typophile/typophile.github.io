body: "I am creating a outline of Typographic Terms, but based on current research
  of various expert opinions, there is no concrete outline for:\r\n\u2022 Slope\r\n\u2022
  Stress \r\n\u2022 Axis\r\n\r\nSlope\r\nThe angle of inclination of the stems and
  extenders of the entire typeface. Not to be confused with axis.\r\n\r\nStress \r\nThe
  angle at which letterform contrast occurs in a typeface. The direction and degree
  of incline in the axis of a typeface.\r\n\r\nDespite the conflicting opinions about
  Axis, I have determined that those who see this as different than Slope or Stress
  are correct (consider the \u201Co\u201D in Palatino Italic).\r\n\r\nI look forward
  to your opinions! Thanks!"
