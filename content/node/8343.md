body: I&#39;m reading a 1971 book &#40;Lettering as Drawing/Nicolete Gray&#41; which
  contains historical images of letter sketches and type specimens from various artists
  and manuscripts from 1528 to 1970. My first thought is the author and publisher
  do not have copyright to these older letterforms. Should I even begin to consider
  digitizing some of these alphabets? <BR> <BR>Of course, some of the artists may
  have estates retaining rights to their works. In particular, I&#39;m eyeing a line
  engraving from Lucs Materot &#40;1608&#41;, woodcut alphabet from Champ Fleury by
  G. Tory &#40;1529&#41;, and alphabet from E. Mulir&#39;s Lettres et Enseignes Art
  Nouveau.

    <BR> <BR>I know that Dyana Weissman &#40;FontBureau&#41; is working on a Materot
    script face. <BR> <BR>The Tory stuff is way too old/disinherited to enjoy any
    legal protection. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks for the wisdom, Hrant. <BR> <BR>I notice Octavo has an edition of Champ
    Fleury for $35, which is an essential to my library. I&#39;m wondering how many
    of Tory&#39;s letterings have been made into fonts. Coincidently, the Tory sample
    I found in Gray&#39;s book is a sample spread on the Octavo site, so I see that
    typeface is called &#34;Fantastic Letters&#34; &#40;sample attached&#41;. Anyone
    know if this font exists? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/56975.jpg"
    alt="G Tory Fantastic Alphabet from Champ Fleury"> <BR> <BR>If Champ Fleury is
    full of Tory&#39;s letterings, would a person legally be able to fonticize a few
    of them, or would creating a typeface fall under digital reproduction of Octavo&#39;s
    copyright?
