  many reviews. Is anyone here using it? Is it fast, and does it stay out of the way?  <BR>
  <BR>Also, a question about uninstallation: can it simply be dragged to the trash

  body: I&#39;m using FAP 3 and it&#39;s as fast and stable as the <a href="http://typographi.com/000858.php"
    target="_blank">previous versions</a>. <BR> <BR>Because I am such a fan of FAP
    I&#39;ve never uninstalled, so I can&#39;t  <BR>answer that one.

  body: I&#39;m using FAP 3, and if you liked previous versions, you&#39;ll probably
    like this version, which isn&#39;t very different. It seems like they wanted to
    split it into a simple edition for individual users, and create an enterprise
    product for design shops, with the extra price they can charge for that being
    the clear motivation. <BR> <BR>I prefer FontReserve&#39;s options for previewing
    fonts to FAP&#39;s relatively paltry options. Also, FAP&#39;s preview panes support
    neither TrueType GX or OpenType&#39;s features &#40;I think it&#39;s still a Carbon
    app at core, which would explain this&#41;, so if the font you&#39;re looking
    at has all kinds of fancy-pants features, you&#39;re not going to see them there.
    <BR> <BR>Also, despite Insider&#39;s claims, it is occasionally possible to corrupt
    the FontAgent database. I have a problem where fonts have started becoming unpreviewable,
    which causes them to be culled when they&#39;re &#34;audited&#34; &#40;a new feature
    in FAP 3&#41;. My solution was to start over again, and I haven&#39;t seen the
    problem since. <BR> <BR>Those are my only quibbles, and after dealing with FontReserve,
    they seem very minor in comparison. I used to love FontReserve, but these days
    it feels so ungainly, and it&#39;s crash-prone, in comparison to FAP, which is
    stable as a rock. <BR> <BR>FAP will manage your system fonts for you, and put
    them in its own special folders, but once you turn off system font management,
    it puts them all back where they belong. And there&#39;s nothing too extraordinary
    about the organization of the master repository it uses, so deinstalling the program
    is a matter of turning off the system font management and dragging the program
    &#40;and its support files in your Library&#41; into the trash. Just make sure
    you copy fonts rather than move them into the library.

  body: 'Thanks for the input, Stephen and Forrest. I&#39;ve never bothered with anything
    like FAP before, and since all the reviews I&#39;ve found were for version 2.1,
    I wanted to hear about the new version from actual users. <BR> <BR>&#34;FAP will
    manage your system fonts for you, and put them in its own special folders, but

  body: Hm, I&#39;m trying the demo, and so far, it&#39;s not doing what I expected.
    <BR> <BR>When I tried importing, it didn&#39;t just import the fonts from my system
    font directories. It also imported all the other font collections I have on-disk.
    I ended up with over a thousand fonts I didn&#39;t want installed, all lumped
    together with the ones I did want. The program was so slow as to be unusable;
    and then it locked up and had to be force-quit. <BR> <BR>Since I had merely copied
    my fonts when importing them, I decided to move my inactive fonts to another volume,
    delete the Fontagent font directory, and re-import. Now half my applications have
    crashed, FontAgent still thinks all those non-existant fonts are still installed,
    and I&#39;m not sure what to do.

  body: 'Almost everybody seems to have that problem with FontAgent the first time
    they use it, which is part of the reason why I included that link to the FontGeek
    article up above. The first time you run FontAgent, it tries to initialize itself
    by scanning all the fonts on your disk. If you have it set to &#34;activate fonts
    upon import&#34;, then yeah, having 1,000 fonts suddenly active is going to cause
    problems. <BR> <BR>If you truly want to start over, try deleting the FontAgent
    Pro directory in your Library and then firing it up again. I don&#39;t know if
    there&#39;s any way to keep it from scanning your disk when it goes to initialize
    its database, but if you turn off &#34;activate fonts after import&#34;, you shouldn&#39;t
    end up with too many problems. I&#39;ve imported upwards of 16,000 fonts into
    FontAgent &#40;to test it&#41;, and that makes the browser very slow to start
    up, but as long as only a small subset of those fonts are active at any given
    time, the rest of the system&#39;s performance was unaffected. <BR> <BR>IMPORTANT:
    if you do decide to do this, make sure that you&#39;ve disabled &#34;manage system
    fonts&#34; before you trash the Library folder, and then reactivate it after you&#39;ve
    reinitialized FontAgent by running the browser and importing some fonts. I don&#39;t
    know if it keeps track of that state in its database, but better safe than sorry!
    Good luck!'

    that seems to have done the trick. I had read the link you posted above, but it
    still wasn&#39;t clear to me that FontAgent would scour my entire hard disk looking
    for fonts. <BR> <BR>I hope it performs okay with limited sets active. It&#39;s
    certainly awful with a thousand fonts active. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help and

  body: You&#39;ll need to fire up the Activity Monitor and force-quit the FontAgent
    Activator to get it to truly shut down. Sorry, I should have mentioned that. I
    think you can turn off the &#34;automatically activate fonts&#34; preference in
    the FontAgent browser to turn it off, too. If you have a lot of fonts, that process
    sure likes to suck up the RAM... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having such
    a tough time with it. I had some problems with database corruption early on, but
    aside from that, and the browser being a little slow, FontAgent has been a very
    straightforward program to use. If you can get the whole thing working, I think
    you&#39;ll like it. It&#39;s miles

  body: Well, all my previously installed fonts &#40;including the basics like Helvetica&#41;
    disappeared after trying the import process again with a clean slate. Maybe there
    are some hidden import options I&#39;m missing. I&#39;ve just uninstalled it for
    now, I might give it another shot some other time. I&#39;m still convinced from
    its feature-set that it&#39;s better than its competitors, but font management
    needs to be easier than this!
