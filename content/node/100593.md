  but now it's done already.\r\n[[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Din-1451-modernization/7182369]]\r\n\r\nFor
  learning fontlab studio I took my favourite font DIN 1451 and added some ligatures.
  When the course entitled \"Project work\" came around I had already set my mind
  to either doing my own complete font, or modernizing DIN as far as time would allow
  me to. The course gave me 100 hours, but I likely put in closer to twice that.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Typophile forums beeing somewhat unintuitive, I wanted to save-mid writing
    and ended up posting that.\r\n\r\nWhat I actually did was\r\nAdding glyphs to
    make it support Unicode Basic latin, latin-1 supplement & Latin Extended-A\r\nAdded
    and coded 13 ligatures, alternate ligatures (and made two stylistic alternate
    of ligatures)\r\nAdded a few (poorly implemented) characters and glyphs, alpha,
    omega, florin and a few others.\r\nAdded stylistic alternates (rounded letters
    with dieresis and i dots / dashed 0 and unimplemented alternate ligatures)\r\nAdded
    a few kerning classes & exceptions.\r\n\r\nBoth myself and my teacher/handler
    enjoyed this project.\r\nI'll gladly take comments, critique or whatever you'd
    like to say.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to point out that this was my first real typographic
    work / time using fontlab and that I was 17 when I made this."

    reasonable. One never knows!  - Herb '

    is however a gray area, at least when it comes to <em>certain</em> Adobe fonts:
    if all parties involved buy a license to the original, they should be OK in acquiring
    the derivative as well.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I can see few problems in diacritics, that you should solve before trying
    to do anything more with it:\r\n\r\n- Polish ogonek is not a some addon or accent
    like acute or slash, it is a intergral part of a letter. So in most cases it's
    smoothly connected to the letter. See polish diacritics at bottom.\r\n- Caron
    should be in optical middle of the letter. See diacritics.eu at bottom. \r\n-
    Caron with /t, /d, /l (\u0165, \u010F, \u013E) should be more closer to the letter
    and tighter. \r\n- Ring over letter like \u016E should be much more stronger.\r\n-
    Circumflex above h should be above the stem in the middle. See ilovetypography.com
    at bottom.\r\n- I think breve is too wide. \r\n- Double crossed t? (9th line at
    the end)\r\n- tcedilla should be tcommaacent\r\n- udieresis is missing (or it
    isn't on behance) uhungarumlaut is only for hungarian language\r\n- commaaccent
    diacritics is missing - letters like R, N, G, T, r, n, g, t\r\n\r\nLinks to study:\r\nhttp://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/index.html\r\nhttp://www.diacritics.eu/en/\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/2009/01/24/on-diacritics/\r\nhttp://diacritics.typo.cz/\r\n\r\nFeel

    body: "Jan, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to write all this help.\r\nMy
      project wasn't to re-make anything DIN 1451 has, it was to extend and modernize
      it, hence I didn't do \xFC\xDC/\xDF (even if I could perhaps do a lowercase
      eszett).\r\n\r\nFrankly, in my unknowing pursuit of making something acceptable
      for personal use, I just went after Latin extended-A and the parts of Latin-1
      Supplement I had time for.\r\n(these exact lists\r\nhttp://www.decodeunicode.org/en/latin_extended-a\r\nhttp://www.decodeunicode.org/en/latin-1_supplement\r\n)\r\n\r\nExplaining
      both \u0166/\u0167 and \u0170/\u0171\r\n\r\nKnowing quite little about languages
      that actually use most of these accents and how they use them I generally just
      went with what fontlab gave me and tried to align it to the optical midpoint,
      fix anything I found aesthetically unpleasing and hint it.\r\n\r\nIf I find
      the time and/or motivation for it I'll fix these problems now, but in a few
      months it'll almost guaranteed to be fixed. "
