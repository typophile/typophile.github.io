  purposes i am using the Pantone neon colors (801-812). \r\nBut i am missing a real
  RGB \"cyan\" like RGB:00ffff.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know a special color, which could
  fit for this? \r\ni didn't find it in Pantone, HKS, nor in RAL. \r\n(everything
  i found, was more light blue or mint green.)"

    some tests with combinations of iridescent, neon and cmyk. Maybe a mix of a PMS

    effect than fluorescents."

  body: i know this would sound ridiculous, and i'm just a beginner in this, but perhaps
    a work done with light-produced colors, can be made on a transparent film? print
    it with bright pantones, holding it against light, with a good print, may bring
    good and colorfull results?

  body: "There isn't a PMS neon blue that has the same lightness as that RGB blue.
    \r\n\r\nPMS 305C has a similar tone, and printed on good  stock (read: non absorbant)
    it is probably also nice and bright. Unfortunately that one isn't neon...\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    you might have to experiment with a 'custom' ink mix, like Bert Vanderveen already
    mentioned. Maybe 'lightening up' one of the PMS neon blue's?"

  body: "Beware: \r\n\r\nIn many cases ink companies don\u2019t actually sell a true
    801 blue. \r\n\r\nThey will make this color from cyan, white, and a touch of green
    from bases then add optical brightener, a fluorescent agent.\r\n\r\nThis is what
    we call in the ink industry \u201Cfalsifying color\u201D.\r\n\r\nAlso mixing (true)
    fluorescent inks with <em>any</em> non-fluorescent ink will ruin all the fluorescent
    effects. Even the most pure  non-fluorescent inks will add \u201Cdirt\u201D\u2014another
    industry term meaning \u201Creduction in chroma\u201D... more grey, less brilliant.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you tell your printer you want pantone 305c with optical brightener added.
    \r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\nUse paper the has bluing/fluorescents add\u2014 you can test
    this by dropping a couple of drops of isopropyl alcohol on a sheet of paper. If
    it does have these properties when the paper dries you should see a pretty indigo
    halo.\r\n\r\nBetween you and me, lexter, most of the audience that will view the
    result of your project will not have sufficient color memory/perception to even
    differ amongst these shades of blue.\r\n\r\nIf this corporate design of yours
    will also be used in signage, you must know that fluorescent pigments are not
    fade resistant to the sun, in fact, the most fugitive of all the the colors.\r\n\r\nYou
    will have to use standard cyan pigments anyway... I recommend pantone 305 with
    o.b. for indoors and pure cyan outside.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"
