body: I have recently come across this beautiful font and I seem to be lost so as
  to what it could possibly be. I can&#39;t seem to get a hint even as far as a possible
  designer of it or a typefoundry releasing it. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your kind support.<img

    did you get this sample from?

  body: Did you hunt around in the book credits for any mention of typefaces used?
    In graphics books this is more likely than in normal &#39;Trade&#39; books, it
    seems to me. <BR> <BR>I have been searching Sans Serif fonts since you posted
    this, and I have not been able to find it. I&#39;m starting to wonder if this
    could be a freeware font, created by selective &#39;mutilation&#39; of something
    like Meta, or Officina, as Tiff suggested.

  body: I&#39;ll tell you how bad this is getting to me - I&#39;m starting to see
    pieces of it in different places. The &#39;y&#39; looks like Conduit. The &#39;g&#39;
    look like News Gothic. And most of the rest of the letters look like they could
    be made from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/d-medium/testdrive.html?s=unteraly+saged+fiber&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">URW Transport</a> by adding some square-cornered terminals, and
    some straight line segments in places &#40;like the &#39;a&#39;&#41;, and then
    removing the stems on a few letters, like the b &amp; d &#40;or get them from
    FF Dax&#41;. The &#39;e&#39; &#40;most common letter&#41; would be the one with
    the most &#39;mutilation&#39;, but it seems like it would be easy. <BR> <BR>I
    think this was a customized font. The &#39;e&#39; and &#39;a&#39; look too clumsy
    for something that seems so nicely weighted and kerned. Tranport has many of the
    right letterforms, and it sure has a very similar &#39;feel&#39; to the sample
    type. <BR> <BR>I think I need to go think about something else, this is making
    me paranoid, or something!

    have a feeling this might be some proprietary font.

  body: Apparently Jens Gelhaar has a lot of output that is not getting into circulation,
    but I did find one of his fonts that is a bit similar in some features to this
    one. It is called <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?BNW" target="_blank">Cornwall</a>.
    I followed the link to the Apply site, but they don&#39;t help you find Gelhaar&#39;s
    works. I cycled through most of their offerings and thought Cornwall was the most
    like Alfa &#40;Alpha?&#41; Sans.

    <BR>It seems Cornwall is still closest, to my eye -- it resembles a grungy sibling
    of Alpha Sans, I might say.
