    that might have kicked in after the first 5 seconds, which is about all I needed

    you like that look up Joe Zeytoonian, he is just a fabulous oud player.\r\n\r\npbc"

    worst things about Armenian weddings. BTW, the 'ood (you can't really write it
    in English...) is my favorite instrument (bagpipes come in second), it sounds
    so primordial. And coincidentally one of its best players goes by the name of
    Udi Hrant!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    saying\r\n\r\n\"\u2026I understand the inventor of the bagpipes was inspired when
    he saw a man carrying an indignant, asthmatic pig under his arm. Unfortunately,
    the man-made object never equalled the purity of sound achieved by the pig.\"
    \r\n-Alfred Hitchcock\r\n\r\nLove the bagpipes - from a distance, echoing through
    Edinburgh, floating on the wind. Also love the uilleann pipes, their Irish cousin.
    There's an old Roma tradition of playing bagpipes in Hungary. Check out these
    wicked Hungarian bagpipes:\r\nhttp://www.tobakstudios.com/Bagpipes.htm\r\n\r\nThe
    oud has a very distinct sound among stringed instruments. Love it.\r\n\r\nThe
    world is full of such great music and all we get \"served\" is KROQ.\r\n\r\npbc"

    I had never heard before. I had goosebumps for the entire ride."
