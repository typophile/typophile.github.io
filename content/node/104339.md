body: "My company has been working with Lucida Sans for print and screen text, and
  lately I have been fielding complaints about what is perceived as a patchy, low-res
  look of the typeface as it appears on screen (apps, email etc). It performs well
  in print, however. \r\n\r\nI asked a type designer, and he told me that Lucida Sans
  was originally designed for low-res screens, and on today's high-resolution screens
  maintains an appearance that has not aged well with the times. He also said that
  Microsoft has largely abandoned Lucida Sans as a font it supports.\r\n\r\nCan anybody
  affirm this problem? Is there a version of Lucida Sans that has been \"modernized\",
  smoothed out so that it takes on a better appearance on screen/the web?\r\n\r\nWe
  are looking at alternate plan B solutions such as Segoe, Myriad, Calibri and Verdana.
  We would like to avoid this as we have set many templates in Lucida Sans as is and
  it will be a pain to change them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "How Lucida Sans appears on screen depends on several factors: the platform/apps,
    the screen resolution and point/pixel size, and which of the three common versions
    is actually being used. Windows has Lucida Sans Unicode (one weight), Mac has
    Lucida Grande (regular and bold), and some Microsoft products ship with a family
    that has true italics but covers a smaller character set. While these versions
    are largely identical in design, differences in their hinting can affect screen
    appearance at smaller sizes. Here's an article that examines some of the rendering
    inconsistencies: [[http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/lucida-hybrid-the-grande-alternative/|Lucida
    Hybrid: The \u2018Grande\u2019 Alternative]].\r\n\r\nHowever, this is mainly an
    issue for lower-res devices that use hinting more aggressively in rendering (i.e.
    Windows). Higher-res devices should render the font more closely to how it looks
    in print, which you say performs well."
