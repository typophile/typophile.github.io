  body: "Yes. It was called Monopol and the only digital version I'm aware of was
    made years ago and offered as a freebie by George Williams. It is readily available
    on the Web, Yves - I'm just not finding it on any \"good\" sites. \r\n\r\nRest
    assured that it was always a free font. Williams used to offer a bunch of them
    from his website on the Duke University domain, but that doesn't seem to be there
    any more.\r\n\r\nEdit: Page 23 of the Solotype Catalog, Nick."
