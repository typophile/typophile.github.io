body: "Do expanded character sets in retail fonts\u2014anything beyond Latin-1\u2014pay
  for the time it takes to develop them?\r\n\r\nAs a newbie font designer I keep throttling
  my ambitions so that I can actually finish an original project. One limit I am considering
  imposing on myself is not developing character sets beyond Latin-1. I enjoy working
  with diacritical marks and learning about how they\u2019re used in other languages
  but I\u2019m not sure that anybody outside of the Latin-1 world will buy a font
  to use the expanded character sets anyway. I know that this has a lot to do with
  the high piracy rates in \u201Cdeveloping nations\u201D, and given the state of
  the economy, I need to worry more about bringing in some money. "

  body: The answer to this question depends a lot on the kind of fonts you're making.
    Is it a display typeface? Or a text family that is appropriate for rebranding
    a multinational corporation or publication?

  body: Also depends if you're planning to sell these yourself or work with a distributor
    - who may have character set requirements. If you are selling these yourself you
    might want to provide smaller char-sets and do extensions on request.

  body: "From a strictly financial POV, adding non-Latin (say, Greek and/or Cyrillic)
    is almost certainly not worthwhile. Extended Latin is less certain, but probably
    doing much beyond, say, Adobe CE, is not going to pay off so well. Heck, even
    Adobe CE may not be worthwhile financially, but since it's a pretty small amount
    of additional work, it's not much risk, either.\r\n\r\nThat being said, doing
    more language support may be fun, and is certainly a service to the global community.
    Then again, in terms of \"service\" one might simply seek out specific *really*
    under-served languages and try to support them....\r\n\r\nBTW, one would think
    that having much more language support would make one's typeface more likely to
    be selected for international branding purposes and the like. Although this is
    probably *somewhat* true, it seems to be much less true than it ought to be. In
    my experience working with major corporate customers at Adobe, it seemed like
    80-90% of the time the typeface was selected first, and then whether it supported
    all the languages they wanted that was an afterthought, unrelated to the selection
    process.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: On the other hand, my experience with FontFonts is that language support is
    often a major influence in the buying decision. FontFont's European customer base
    (in contrast to Adobe's) is certainly a factor.

  body: "Generally speaking, taking a little additional effort always pays up - but
    not always from a financial point of view. Frankly said, even in Basic Latin there
    are some glyphs used in quite rare languages like Icelandic and Faroese (eth and
    thorn come to mind). How many customers from these countries from these countries
    you expect to have? And still, most typefaces contain these glyphs. Small effort,
    but valued by the people who license your fonts.\r\n\r\nSo my 2\xA2 are: best
    to stick with Basic Latin, and if you have the time and will, optionally you can
    expand later the character set with Latin Extended-A and charge extra for these
    versions. Cyrillics is worthwhile, but requires considerable effort (and is country-specific!),
    and the market for it is somehow thin. Still some foundries (Storm, ShinnType
    and CastleType, for example) provide well-designed cyrillics, so this may rise
    the sales of your fonts. Of course, I'm speaking as a person, who uses Cyrillics
    regularly, so I'm biased; when deciding which typeface to use for a project, for
    me the availability of Cyrillics is a major consideration."

    Don't FontShop have 2 prices, Standard and Pro, with Pro offering the expanded

  body: "<em>How many hours does it take to extend your font(s) with a CE set?</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    can take a lot of time to get right.\r\nFor instance, \"comma below\" is a nasty
    little thing to squeeeze in if you don't have much descender room and the weight
    is bold. It has to be designed: does it match the comma or the acute, or is it
    just a vertical dash? Decisions, decisions. Dan, please start a thread on this,
    showing samples!\r\nThe slovakian d- and l- caron characters require extra kerning.
    Does one make the character widths normal and add kerning where there is overlap,
    or wider, and remove it where there are gaps? Should this character be the traditoinal
    comma shape, or the newer \"thin acute\"? Decisions, decisions. \r\nThe ogonek
    characters are nicer if a proper composite glyph is made, rather than just superimposing
    the accent. \r\nIs it really possible to fit an acute (over l) or circumflex (over
    h) above an ascender? Perhaps if one cheats the height of the ascender down a
    bit, flatten the angle of the accent a tad...\r\nWill this breve look too much
    like a caron in Czech?\r\nWill the tilde above \"i\" collide with adjacent ascenders:
    to fix by making it narrower, or adding kerning?\r\nAnd so on, into the small
    caps."

  body: I think you definately should do it, it's not that much extra work to do a
    couple of extra accents and a few more composite glyphs if you compare to the
    total time of developing the full typeface. There are very good resources on how
    everything should look for us who are not used seeing these accents :) And it
    gets easier for every new typeface you work on, and eventually you'll get a nice
    workflow and can make a lot of your developing time more effective.
