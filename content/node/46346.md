body: "Adobe Type Marketing will commission 80 RGB GIF images of 100x100 pixels, each
  representing a specific typeface family (e.g. Myriad Pro) or themed collection of
  fonts (e.g. Weddings). The design must be interesting to graphic designers, and
  communicate something of the family's/collection's unique qualities. Adobe will
  provide the fonts, and review the work (and may request changes).\r\n\r\nThe delivery
  date is negotiable, but by default will be 60 days after the contract is signed.
  If interested, please submit a bid and a few digital samples of relevant designs
  to Nicole Bok nbok[at]adobe.com."

  body: "The 100x100 limitation is an interesting challenge, but I think this could
    still be a fun project for some typographic designer out there.\r\n\r\nWhen we
    say \"a bid,\" that is to say what price you'd want to charge per GIF. We're not
    saying that we will offer this to the lowest bidder, btw, just that we want to
    know what you'd charge.\r\n\r\nBTW, if the candidates wanted to, I think we'd
    consider splitting up the project among a couple of designers, to reduce \"design
    fatigue\" and increase the variety of designs.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
