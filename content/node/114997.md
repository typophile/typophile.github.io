  body: I definitely disagree on this one, Ryuk. Jazz Dark filled in matches perfectly.
    Loungy will not match no matter what is done with it (just look at the L alone).

  body: Not trying to be competitive, Ryuk. I'm happy to see a perfect match no matter
    who makes it (and <em>often</em> impressed by your wide scope of expertise).

    here and I like the competition, not against all other identifiers and type experts
    but against my self ignorance. Frustration is key to me, I want to know them all!"
