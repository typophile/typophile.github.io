    and design and is a very practical book. The only caveat is that it only goes
    up to the 80s so the digital side of typography is not addressed. <BR>I also like
    Stop Stealing Sheep by Erik Spiekermann, it is a nicely illustrated introductory
    text. '

    might think it&#39;s &#34;strange&#34; is simply that we&#39;ve been brainwashed
    into loving industrialization over the past 100 years. I think when Gill&#39;s
    book came out, there were a lot more people who &#34;got it&#34;. <BR> <BR>According
    to the colophon&#42;, &#34;Essay&#34; was in fact the first use of Joanna. And
    the later 1936 edition was set in foundry, not Monotype. <BR> <BR>&#42; It has

  body: '<i>Type &amp; typography</i> by Phil Baines and Andrew Haslem is a great
    book for beginners as well as those with more experience. It approaches type first
    and foremost from the linguistic point of view in a section called &#39;function&#39;,
    then move onto &#39;form&#39;, where history and classification are discussed
    in great details. The third section is about the designing and manufacturing of
    type. The next section is titled &#39;Structure&#39;, where hierarchy, grid, and
    the fine points about setting type are covered. The last section is &#39;Conventions&#39;,
    the &#39;rules&#39; of setting text type, if you will. The whole book is illustrated
    throughout with relevant and engaging examples, The main running text set in Swift
    in a large point size and &#39;sidebars&#39; set in a smaller Meta that goes into
    more depth about each issue discussed. I highly recommend this book. I think it&#39;s
    one of the best, most comprehensive and least biased I&#39;ve seen so far. It
    is quite a brilliant achievement: it has a lot of depth and students are going
    to <i>like</i> reading it because it actually <i>looks</i> so interesting. Along
    with Bringhurst, it&#39;s going to be required reading for my type class.'

    agree. Maybe the best single &#34;textbook&#34; out there. <BR> <BR>The only thing
    that bugs me is that they go to all that wonderful trouble of setting up typography

    i&#39;m one of those people who aren&#39;t bothered by subtitles in films. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m envious. I have a lot of trouble watching a foreign movie in a language
    I know because I can&#39;t help reading the subtitles. Same thing with the opera
    these days - those stinky surtitles - guys, you&#39;re supposed to know the story
    before you get there anyway, you know?! The point in opera is the delivery. And
    to me the only really good thing about DVDs is that you can turn the subtitles
    off. I even like watching foreign movies that I <i>can&#39;t</i> understand -
    they often make more sense that way. Like before I knew Spanish I enjoyed Mexican
    TV much more. And one time I was watching Ran, and I called the station yelling
    at them to turn of the subtitles... <BR> <BR>Now <i>I&#39;m</i> getting out of
    hand... <BR> <BR>One thing I found definitely kind of innovative in Ruder&#39;s
    book is that page where they compare regular and irregular spacing of letters
    of different structures, with carefully selected words set large. That was sharp.

    - that they are looking for shortcuts. they are looking for &#34;how to&#34; books.  <BR>
    <BR>e.g. a post by a guy&#40;not here&#41;. he wrote, more or less, : i am new
    to fonts. i am looking for a book about metrics. <BR> <BR>the problem: he wants
    to create a typeface. but he does not know what is a typeface. just to buy FontLab
    or Fog....you can&#39;t create a typeface. <BR> <BR>Steven Heller, the Great Heller
    wrote &#40; about illustration - but i think you can say type design/ graphic
    design etc., etc., &#41; : <BR> <BR>&#34;...At most art schools, despite the requisite
    nod to the liberal arts, the student is not exposed to or encouraged to take part
    in classes about literature, sociology, psychology, or history... <BR> <BR>&#34;Having
    a liberal education will not necessarily guarantee a rosy illustration career,
    BUT neither will an art school education. What liberal arts WILL facilitate is
    a better understanding of subjects and themes that an illustrator will encounter
    in a majority of assignments..... <BR> <BR>&#34;......Without THESE TOOLS AN ARTIST
    CAN MAKE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING PICTURES.....BUT BEING VISUALLY LITERATE IS NOT
    SIMPLY A MATTER OF TURNNING A CIRCLE, SQUARE AND CONE INTO A CAT OR DOG, BUT ASSIMILATING,
    SYNTHESIZING AND TRANSLATING HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE INTO VISUAL TERMS.&#34;
