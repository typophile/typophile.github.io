    so it can't\r\nbe Consolas (or really anything else).\r\nI wonder who made it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Here's what they say... "Although the handwriting was modelled on a font called
    Consolas, the movements for each of the 90 characters had to be coded by hand,
    resulting in slightly unsteady lettering that makes the missives seem all the
    more human."

  body: "Oh, OK. I wonder why they didn't save money by using an existing stroke font,
    <em>and like maybe one that looks <strong>more human</strong></em>... Another
    way that explanation is retarded: hand-coding does not of course make it \"unsteady\".
    Unless the coder has some very specific type of brain damage.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I wonder if all the money spent creating fake handwriting equals all the
    money spent 150 years ago in trying to go the other way, with the typewriter and
    linotype.\r\n\r\nHey, maybe I can get a grant to build a robot that will chisel
    the words of MPs onto granite slabs.\r\n\r\n(Color me unimpressed.)"
