  body: "All of it, or specifically the title? Some of this is easy enough - the writer
    and illustrator's surnames in Aachen for instance, or the thin sans which is small
    (and thus a bit hard to see) but probably Akzidenz-grotesk. I think the subtitle
    of the book is probably Century Old Style with an added stroke.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the title itself, I'm going to guess completely custom, or at least heavily customised
    off a base like Haettenschweiler or Helvetica Inserrat, with which it shares several
    characteristics. The stroke widths vary a lot, the legs of the two /R/s are completely
    different, those narrow slits for counters are totally out of proportion and don't
    line up porperly etc. etc. The grunge is also custom, of course."
