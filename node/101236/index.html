  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Could you recommend a san serif to go with TEFF Trinite Roman Wide for a resume? I have used DTL Caspiri in the past, but its limited weights, cost, and imperfect match got me to thinking about a change. I have considered Whitney (maybe too large x-height and too small descenders), Ideal Sans (but the lowercase g would match more a transitional typeface, and Syntax (since it is based loosely on Stempel Garamond and has lowercase a and g that sort of match Trinite). Any suggestions from someone with a better eye than I have?</div>

<p>Regarding Trinité: It is calligraphic and not a general workhorse like Iowan Old Style or Minion (the latter really isn&rsquo;t so invisible, but its multilanguage support might make it good enough to use as a generic text font).
Although Trinité is a good choice in the book &ldquo;Turning over a New Leaf: Change and Development in the Medieval Book&rdquo;, and is good for poetry (as was suggested in &ldquo;Book Typography: a designer&rsquo;s manual&rdquo;, I think it is more versatile than that. It is hampered by its high price, older format (postscript), lack of ligatures, and weights (the medium is too bold). I think those are the major reasons one does not see it used more. In smaller sizes, the peculiarities of its calligraphic elements are diminished. Like various Garamonds, it requires some care in size, leading, layout, etc - maybe more than some other fonts, but that does not make it limited to poetry and whimsical text.</p>
<p>Matching a sans is not easy. Maybe that is why Microsoft substituted Calibri for Times/Arial for its default Office (on the Windows side): it was good enough for short text, tables, and headings and pretty versatile in just four weights.</p>
<p>I have seen the recommendations in &ldquo;The Big Book of Font Combinations&rdquo; for matching serif and san serif. Personally, the only nearly perfect match I&rsquo;ve seen is with Scala. (It is my favorite for books that require a lot of tables and text). Even Documenta and Haarlemmer sans/serif variants clash a bit. When the Sans and Serif are clearly from different periods and very different, they can go fairly well together; and as they get closer, they start to clash. It is like colours.</p>
<p>Foundary Sans is the closest I see to Trinité in letterforms, but the lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo; has a slanted bowl that really doesn&rsquo;t fit with the other letters nor with Trinité. Syntax has a very different x-height and the &ldquo;a&rdquo; is even more different and the angled feet on &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;N&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>So, if there is not a good letterform match between a Sans and Serif, how does one pick a good match that is complementary and not clash? Arial/Helvetica and Times or Myriad and Minion are complementary but not even close to the same letter forms or even vintage but they work more or less.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Finding typefaces that are &ldquo;harmonious in spirit&rdquo; is difficult, because that requires a real understanding of the essence of several  typeface families. So assuming one is looking for a humanistic sans, if one wants to keep with Dutch typeface families, once comes up with one list, but Dutch typefaces are too broad to be the only limiter. Caligraphic typefaces would be another starting point, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to work (Cronos or Beorcana for example). Scala Sans is not bad, and both derive from French old style, but some of the choices in modernization that went into Scala Serif are quite different than Trinité. Whitney is what Myriad should have been, and is the opposite: fairly bland and corporate looking. Ideal sans is not so ideal, because although it may be one of the most readable sans, many serifs are more readable, and most of the subtle curves get lost at small sizes. (it also has a distinctive &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&rdquo; which make it not blend well with other fonts, and I think its individual letter forms look better than words using it.) Probably that is why finding good graphic designers is neither easy nor cheap.</div>
