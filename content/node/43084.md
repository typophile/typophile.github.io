    it doesn't make it sound like one thing or the other. But I have to admit that
    until Tiff vouched for them I was never going to think about them seriously simply
    because I had no basis for doing so. I support what they are doing (I think...)
    but while my concern that they were just a front collecting email addresses for
    spam is now allayed, my new concern is that being too secret could get in the
    way of getting their work done. Not everybody knows Tiff after all. Maybe this
    is not really a problem. I am interested in understanding this better though."

    spoke to several foundry reps about hosting events with a font business (rather
    than tech or historical) focus. In talking to foundries it seemed as if the FDRC
    member list would be the ideal audience. Beyond that not every foundry is a member
    (such as Font Bureau or Microsoft for that matter) hence opening it up to non-member
    vendors and type designers via the notices posted here, on lists and blogs that
    type designers and font vendors frequent. \r\n\r\nHope every type designer or
    font vendor will consider attending, I expect we'll all learn a lot.\r\n"

    victimized, it's OK to say \"please don't hit me again\", but anything stronger
    is asking for more beats--because you can't rely on the authorities to protect
    you. Hence the softly-softly tactic. It's sad, but what else can you do? It would
    be unrealistic to imagine that a well-publicized anti-piracy campaign with industry-wide
    support would have any effect, seeing what has happened with music downloads.
    \r\n\r\nAnother approach is to ignore the swarm of gnats, and make a better product
    that people will want to buy rather than rip off. And write easier-to-understand
    EULAS. And provide consumer education. But all these are happening too, and no
    doubt pirates find the better products to their liking, and the attempts at reforming
    their mind-set very amusing.\r\n\r\nThe problem is intractable, as DTP is predicated
    on easy-to-copy font formats.\r\n"

    you label them as wilfully resistant to honoring IP or property laws or ethics.
    I don't think everyone sharing fonts is intentionally committed to piracy, I think

    has anywhere near the awareness of type that they have of film and music media.
    The general idea in the states is that those media do have value, but that some
    people enjoy somehow getting free access to them. By contrast, fonts are just
    there, they grow on trees or are made by machines, and have no value <strong>because</strong>
    you can get them for free. Note: I'm not saying this difference exists, I'm saying
    the attitude, and the awareness it comes from, is very different. Do you not see
    that? "

    Wal-Mart <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/walmart.html\">gallon-of-pickles,</a>
    executive compensation packages, and font bundling.\r\n\r\nBut really, what does

    if you don't have to? Why bother to even think about what it's worth? \r\n\r\nI
    was talking about fonts with a freelance graphic designer I bumped into at a party,
    and asked him where he got his from. He said a buddy of his gave him a CD full.
    I'm pretty sure he had no idea how many fonts there were on it, or what it would
    cost to licence them, and didn't care. He knew I was a type designer but it didn't
    phase him--probably didn't make the connection that he may have been using my
    fonts for free."
