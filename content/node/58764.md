  except it has slight variations and it's l/c characters are more like small caps.\r\n\r\nI
  found a forum entry from 2005 asking this question, but it had one response and
  no resolution.\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/chrysler_font_sample_3464.gif]"

    shady site hawking it and a slew of other fonts listed for $15... but you had
    to spend a minimum of $30... WTF?\r\n\r\n[link removed by moderator]\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure that is a quality and reputable operation!\r\n\r\nSo, it's out there, just
    elusive!"
