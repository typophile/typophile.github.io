body: I input this image &#40;a crude tracing from a poor scan of the Typography 21
  book cover&#41; into the type identifier on MyFonts.com and it told me &#34;Bell
  Centennial&#34;, however, it&#39;s not quite the same.  The &#34;divit&#34; thingies
  &#40;for lack of a better term&#41; really make it unique.  Bell Centennial has
  these on the numbers, but most of its letters are just plain block like a Helvetica.  The
  &#34;divits&#34; are very noticeable on the &#34;E&#34; and every other letter,
  yet Bell Centennial does not contain these on the standard weight of the font...the
  heavy black version of the font does though...but I&#39;m looking for a normal and
  bold weight, not black.  Can anyone help? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/7054.jpg"

  body: Those things are called &#34;traps&#34;, and it&#39;s true that only the darker
    weight of Bell Centennial has them so pronounced. And Carter would never have
    forgotten to put one in the cusp of the &#34;6&#34;! And there&#39;s also one
    missing from the top of the &#34;4&#34;. It might be Retina, but TFJ would also
    not have made such big mistakes. <BR> <BR>If/when you find out, please do let
    me know - I&#39;d appreciate it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'The 4 and 6 very well could have those traps.  I traced a small scan as best
    I could see.  I can&#39;t seem to find &#34;Retina&#34;, do you know where?  I
    assume Carter/TFJ would be the creator of the font?  '

  body: 'Huh, I hadn&#39;t seen a good sample of Amplitude. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not stodgy
    enough to scoff at the use of traps in a decorative manner &#40;FF Bradlo did
    it a while aback, and I can dig it&#41;, but I do mind the size inconsistencies:
    like the &#34;A&#34; having deeper cuts than the &#34;M&#34;, and the ones on
    the &#34;Z&#34; having overly large mouths. I think that&#39;s distracting. Christian
    &#40;who I think is a talented designer&#41; doesn&#39;t seem to frequent Typophile,
    so feel free to tell him I said so.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
