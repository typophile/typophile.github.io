My first cognitive impressions are of calligraphic ampersand.
But before that I just admired the flow, balance and movement.

but seriously, i am trying to figure out what a "protoglyph" is. a glyph is a symbol with meaning, of course, according to our very own typowiki. and proto- is a prefix meaning first, earliest, or original. furthermore, in combination with other words, it means - more or less - a foundation or basis for things which come after it or develop from it. e.g., prototype, protolanguage, etc.

are you thinking your inadvertant squiggle has a universality or flexibility to be the basis for a whole - ahem - "set" of glyphs?

My comments were definitely not directed at you or your post. I am sorry you understood it that way. If you read the messages on this thread prior to your postings I am sure you will see what my comments were refering to.

Also, as you use this site more I think that you will find that there is a generally light-hearted kidding that goes on here.

		<div class="commentbody">A rethink on this “protoglyph”.

for some reason Proto (glyph) seems to indicate that it is the  Proto, or base of glyph. After all Protoplasm is the base form, so protoglyph is the base or clay form for a set of glyphs all based upon, or derived from this scribble.

To use the term “protoglyph” Hrant has not casually tossed this word in. It is there for a reason, so ignore the picture and concentrate upon the word.

Here's a term that may clear up my ramble, think about it.
- ProtoType

Oho ! Something just occured to me. Left of normal thinking but not inconceivable. With a more complex “protoglyph”, it would be possible to have a font of one (1) glyph, where all characters are taken from using mathematical formula to extract from that single glyph all information to make and display each and every other glyph imaginable.
Alternately that single glyph cell could be made up of a grid of unconnected points where using same system as before, all characters and glyphs could be determined from.

Wow, imagine it, all font files would be tiny in size.

		<div class="commentbody">OK, now that the wonderful brain-dumping has gone dormant I think it's safe to reveal what <cite>I</cite> was thinking, even though it's pretty boring compared to the previous flotsam and jetsam of the human psyche...

Not too long ago, in a thread as close as a few clicks away, there was (yet another) "discussion" about chirography and its [de]merits. I had made a distinction between painting and drawing, claiming that the former forms the bodies of shapes (and hence can't make ideal notan) while the latter forms the boundaries of shapes (hence has a qualitatively better chance). Well, looking that that protoglyph (which I still think is a useful term) it struck me that you can actually draw a boundary chirographically! Which is not to say it's practical and fruitful to do so. One clue that it isn't is that absolutely nobody does that. And one great reason not to is that the topology of the glyph (in fact that 8 - yes, all I was seeing was a boring numeral) might make it non-sensical, since you can't have crossing outlines. You can make an "o" for example, but to make a decent "x" you'd need to go around in a contortive way (although what else is new about chirography :-). Anyway, even though I think it's unworkable it might still result in interesting experiments and extrapolations, so have fun with the idea if you like.

I love that thing. In college I actually made an animation of it with my Amiga, put it on videotape, and borrowed an A/V cart to show it in math class. The teacher was drooling... but I suspect the other students were squirming and sneering.

I don't know how mindbendingly obvious this is to anybody but just in case it isn't... <cite> ...draw a boundary chirographically! One clue that it isn’t is that absolutely nobody does that. </cite> You can of course do 'chirographic' work with two pencils bound together. And you are working in the 'boundries' in that case. And likewise you can do faux chirographic work on a napkin by drawing the seemingly 'chirographic' forms out using a non-chirographic method. But Hrant, your example doesn't seem chirographic to me in any way at all. There is no sense of a front moving. And the while the lines are drawn it is their seen relationship and/or their drawn relationship that might make the form 'chirographic'. Still, I can imagine a process where you start out with two pencils to experiment and end up tweaking those forms with an eraser and pencil on your way to a typographic form you wanted. Have I misunderstood you? What process do you have in mind?</div>

For the n-th time: it's not about the tool, it's about your mind's intent.
Maybe thinking of Peter's "para-chirography" would help.

> your example doesn’t seem chirographic to me in any way at all.

Hopefully because it's not, in the conventional, ubiquitous sense. But the fact is those curves were made chirographically, which however is not how anybody <cite>draws</cite> letterform <cite>outlines</cite>.

David, most specifically I'm thinking about the making of
glyphs in a text face (although I suspect it can be broader).

		<div class="commentbody">Discussing this with Eben I realized that some key elaborations might help this idea along. First there's the issue of: what's the difference between this and drawing? I would say that drawing is slow, iterative, vague and deliberate, while this exhibits a true chirographic essence in its flow and certainty. As for the difference between conventional chirography and this, perhaps the best thing I can point to is the way stroke contrast is distributed: in chirography it results from the nature of the [virtual] tool, while in this method it results from an abstract decision on the part of the maker; if you look at that protoglyph, any part of it (I mean the black/body) can be any thickness*, determined only by the "whim" of the designer - something it shares with drawing. But again, it's different than drawing because the organicity of chirography is there. I dunno, does that help?

* Specifically in my proto-8 the left of the head loop and the base of the bottom loop are heaviest, which is not something natural to conventional chirography. Now, this weighting was not intentional, but it could (and -probably- should) be.

There is also "tight drawing" like Durer who slowly built up the image with great deliberation. The constructivists and de Stijl artists also were deliberate and "constructed" their work (well duh-ah:-). Both of these styles are still drawing but perhaps Hrant might call gesture drawing chirography.

		<div class="commentbody">okay sorry to lead us into spacey new age territory but this universal glyph idea
reminded me of something i saw years ago and finally found a link for:
( no, not the military sencil) the Meru Foundation...  

they're dedicated to cryptic reading of sacred hebrew texts (yikes). they have this OBJECT, a 3-D shape, which can be rotated in any direction to be viewed as any letter of the hebrew alphabet.

they claim the hebrew alphabet can be also generated by posing the human hand, and was formed as a sort of proto sign language using the hand itself as the glyph mechanism.
this object was designed as a perfected version of the capabilities of the hand gestures.

i'm not sure i'm doing justice to their ideas, nor am i particularly inclined to pursue it all, just thought it was an interesting link for this discussion.

Classic post-rationalization.
Quickie trivia question: what (mainstream) writing system has glyphs
based (partly) on the shapes of the mouth/tongue/lips when saying the
sound in question?

That 3D thing is a nice exercise though.

Tim, thanks.
I'm getting the feeling now that somethingo-chiro-graphy
(or chiro-somethingo-graphy) is just too cumbersome.

When I tried to find a definition for "protoglyph" a recurring theme was primitive drawings on the walls of caves. So I was playing with the long shot that you were implicating "wall art" based on your use of the word "protoglyph."

It was silly and a stretch :-)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality

From the wikipedia 

<cite>"Liminality (from the Latin word līmen, meaning "a threshold") is the quality of the second stage of a ritual in the theories of Arnold van Gennep, Victor Turner, and others. In these theories, a ritual, especially a rite of passage, involves some change to the participants, especially their social status.
The liminal state is characterized by ambiguity, openness, and indeterminacy. One's sense of identity dissolves to some extent, bringing about disorientation. Liminality is a period of transition, during which your normal limits to thought, self-understanding, and behavior are relaxed, opening the way to something new.
People, places, or things may not complete a transition, or a transition between two states may not be fully possible. Those who remain in a state between two other states may become permanently liminal." </cite>

I am suggesting this because the process I am seeing & hearing you think about seems all about process, looking for new methods as in 'technique', but also of thought, and is also concerned with both white and black in terms of their relation or threshold rather than in terms of themselves. And 'liminal' is already a solid academic term. So ya got that cred built right in.

And even before Wölfflin, there are theories of art coming out of Italy that distinguish <em>disegno</em> ("design" or "drawing," epitomized by Florentines like Michelangelo) from <em>colorito</em> ("colorism," epitomized by Venetians like Titian). The term "disegno" in particular is often left in the Italian because "drawing" doesn't entirely capture the additional meanings of composition, limitation, demarcation, etc.

So maybe you've been "disegning"? :-)</div>

I must have been standing up, because I was testing/warming-up a "non-trusted" pen, which I typically only do when I'm in a hurry. And the orientation you see is pretty much how I was looking at it.

As for the starting point (and thus direction) it's strange that I'm actually not totally sure. Normally I'd start something like that either going up rightward, or going down leftward (which I think is normal right-hander action) but this is neither. Looking at it some more though I suspect it was most probably started from the bottom-right loose end. Where did it wander off to? I think it must have ended pretty soon afterwards, either just straight or with a small reverse-flick.

BTW, what about "chiroliminal" for this?

Because the method (different than the tool) affects the results.
Painting the body of a glyph is different than drawing a notanic border.

In fact what I'm describing here is a third way.

> This is line drawing/ drawing/ painting (?)

I think it's a painting.
But since it's not a glyph, it doesn't matter (for the sake of staying focused).

Liminography (thanks, Eben) is the rendering of the black-white threshold. What type designers [are supposed to] do. This is one (strange) kind of liminography: chiroliminography.

Chirography BTW doesn't *have* to use a certain marking tool. The central concept is laying down a "black" mark by some movements of the hand/arm system. So you could say that chirography is a subset of painting. I would call this painting "pictography", but that's taken, and really "painting" is a fine word [here].

I do see some technical problems with this terminology structure, but nothing is perfect, so unless somebody manages to throw a capable wrench into it, this is what I'll be using.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, this thing is chiroliminographic, but that's a pretty exotic subset of liminography. Liminography is basically when you make the black-white border the design constraint. In contrast, chirography is when you make the black body the design constraint.

Now, you might say that we necessarily make the black-white border no matter what we're thinking, but that's a mechanical issue; the ideological issue is what you believe as being important - your *intent* (and that *does* affect the results). The more you believe notan is important, the more you approach liminography (and I contest, better readability); the more you believe that something like the Moving Front is important the more you approach chirography (which I contest is an arbitrary constraint, so anti-design).

--

This "8" is made by hand, but it does not favor the black (which necessarily comes at the expense of optimal* notan). On the other hand, because it's "spontaneous" instead of deliberative & iterative this method can't really result in a proper text font; it's really just an interesting display font philosophy. The "normal" way to make an optimal* text font remains the equivalent of a refrigerator making ice!

* Not the same thing as "prefect", or even "ideal".

		<div class="commentbody">If ‘optimal’ -- in the context of notan -- is not the same as ‘perfect’, or even ‘ideal’, then what does it mean? Presuming, based on common usage, that there can't be something ‘better than optimal’, we can at least agree that things can be more or less sub-optimal, closer to or further from optimal, however you are defining the latter. But in the context of notan I am wondering how you recognise these relative states of sub-optimisation. Declaring that favouring the black <em>necessarily</em> comes at the expense of optimal notation seems to me to be begging the question, because it suggests that you are assuming that optimal notan involves some kind of balance between black and white, whereas there are other possibilities, e.g. that it involves specific kinds of tension between black and white.

[Of course, we presume to talk about optimal <em>typographic</em> notan, i.e. functionally optimal for reading. In the more general sense of notan, I don't think it makes any sense to talk in terms of optimisation: notan is an aesthetic phenomenon.]</div>

Although the latter does sound overly self-contented.

And I would say that "optimal" can make sense only within some boundaries against which it's pushing, so I agree that optimalness of notan only makes sense in context (and actually the context doesn't even have to be readability).

But in the context of readability, I do believe that marking the black blocks your path to optimal notan; it makes the letters qualitatively poorer at blending into boumas. This, no matter how much you *want* to make the white equal. Thomas Jefferson had children with Sally Hemings, but she was still a slave.

This is the one link I'm not getting: Why, exactly, is there a correlation between notan – in the sense of balancing the black and the white – and readability? Why exactly can Legato "tie" the letters together into more coherent boumas – or, asking the other way round: Why do you say (if I got that right) that we read the black *and* the white, as coherent wholes, rather than black figures against a white background?</div>

The only time letters matter is when immersive reading breaks, for example when we run into an unfamiliar word; then letters have to be identifiable after (relatively) long foveal observation by the consciousness, which is very easy to ensure.

Our consciousness likes to separate and identify, so it sees individual active black things sitting on top of a uniform passive white background; but our consciousness is not what makes immersive reading work. The black cannot exist without the white - they are essentially one thing.

What I mean is, a character is both black and white, so the black and white are together forming what we see, not the black on the white, or the white on the black, or the red on the off-white-yellowish parchment, or whatever. And because black and white are two ends on this hypothetical line, two extremes, they are actually in a circle, being the same end, but the other side, of a circle, if that makes sense, in that black and white are the same. Ask me more about this circular logic thing some day…

This is just a tangent, perhaps, but the notan discussion might not benefit from specifically discussing things that are the same but identified as opposites. This goes for all concepts that exhibit such characteristics.

One thing that is both scary and beautiful is that with every node we nudge in an outline, we necessarily change both the black and the white; so even from a very practical design-process angle it doesn't really make any sense to think of them as separate things. The outline is not a barrier of Something against the Void – maybe more like a moving membrane between two equal fluids. 

Thinking more about this unity of black&white, here's another thought (and this might have something to do with your question, Ben): The re-thinking of the whites as "equal partners" or the other side of the yin-yang or whatever you want to call it, rather than "the rest of the background, where there is no black", conversely also effects more "active" blacks! It makes both sides more active, by making them more intertwined; by making them interact. Look at Legato: Once the whites start to talk, there can be no picket-fence, silent blacks – right?</div>

Maybe you should preface such statements with ‘I believe that...’ or even ‘It is my theory that...’, rather than presenting such ideas as if they are established fact. They are not. Indeed, other theories of how we read directly contradict these ideas (and not just the parallel letterwise recognition theory).

It seems to me that you are confusing categories, because letters are things perceived whereas boumas are perceptual constructs. There is no such thing as a bouma outside of perception in the same way that there are things that we call letters. You can't sit down and design a bouma. A bouma is a perception of multiple letters or parts of multiple letters as a recognised pattern above the individual letter recognition level. It makes absolutely no sense to me to suggest that perception of a pattern of letters or letter parts is somehow enhanced by making the constituent letters ‘less themselves’. That's like saying that face recognition would be easier or more efficient if the individual features -- eyes, nose, mouth etc. -- were somehow less themselves, when it is precisely the individuality of these features and their arrangement on the skull that establishes a recognisable pattern enabling identification.</div>

I read "making letters less themselves" as making them less "pure" with regard to their own nature/shape/direction/intent, in favor of adding/stressing uniting, "binding" features that wouldn't be needed for letterwise recognition, but help bouma formation. Like serifs. No?</div>

Agreed. In practical terms we are of course adjusting both at once. But as Hrant suggested above, our 'intent' informs where we position the nodes. And if we are focusing on the 'foreground' (or 'marking the black') when drawing we aren't usually paying so much attention to the boundary itself. 

I don't know how this all affects readability, and to what extent we need to be conscious of the letterforms when we read. But I love the way this discussion is turning into an exploration of nondualism!</div>

In Peter Enneson's theory, normal spacing is sub-optimal for individual letter recognition, because it causes 'crowding'. However, it is optimal for recognition of sub-letter features across the word, as these features hit just of or on a frequency grid. The letters are not "less themselves", but normally tight spacing makes them harder to identify as individuals. 

Peter also agrees with Hrant--following Noordzij--that the whites in counters are important "features" that the brain reads.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I think spacing is a separate question. As you say, more tightly spaced letters are not ‘less themselves’: they are letters in a different spatial relationship. The frequency grid theory is one of the things I had in mind when I wrote that other theories of how we read contradict Hrant's assertion re. letters needing to be ‘less themselves’. Perhaps what Hrant actually meant is closer to what you are describing, i.e. letters in a spatial relationship which is not optimal for individual letter recognition but is better for multi-letter or feature pattern recognition. But the phrase ‘less themselves’ suggests to me something else, i.e. somehow undermining legibility at the letter design level in favour of readability, which makes no sense to me. I am perfectly willing to accept that the way in which we perceive letters during immersive reading is different from how we perceive letters in isolation, and that units of recognition in immersive reading may be other than individual letters. But I don't think it follows at all that this either requires or benefits from letters being other than what they are. Again, I think Hrant is confusing categories by treating perceptions of things (boumas) as if they were things perceived (letters, whether individually or as feature patterns on a spatial grid). A bouma is a perception of letters, so it doesn't make any sense to say that boumas benefit from letters being less than letters, and more than it makes sense to say that face recognition benefits from a nose being less than a nose. Indeed, it is difficult even to conceive what such ‘less than-ness’ might look like.

<em>Peter also agrees with Hrant—following Noordzij—that the whites in counters are important “features” that the brain reads.</em>

Well, as I've said before, when we see a bird against the sky, it is the shape of the bird not the shape of the sky that makes it recognisable. The figure-ground relationship is certainly important -- as was interestingly discussed on the previous thread regarding black-white edge effects in Helvetica --, but that is not the same thing as saying that the ground <em>is</em> figure, which seems the implication of talking about counters as features.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I have to admit that despite agreeing with much of what you have written just now (I have yet to find a any evidence for bouma based reading.) the bird against the sky analogy just doesn't wash with me. 

I don't think the features used in recognizing a letter are "black" or "white". Features are recognized because of the presence of adequate ground and can't don't exist in apart from that ground. It may be that some features required for recognition are in a sense "white" like the opening in the bottom of the lc "e". Also a word space is a feature of a text an quite an important one. Moreover it isn't it the case that we simply tally up features and identify a letter. We look for those features to exist in an recognized order or structure which involves both figure and ground at once. To use the face analogy - neither the eyes nor the mouth can be in the middle. And this again means that it isn't the feature but it's presence in a "correct" context that allows letter recognition to occur. I don't think that asking "what is the figure and what is not" is the right question. I think asking "what are the features required for a glyph to be recognized, and how do they need to be composed to result in recognition?" is.

Maybe I have misunderstood what you are saying. Have I?

No, the concept of a gestalt perception of words is that we recognize a word-wide pattern of letter features, ordered in space, without first identifying letters.  

You seem to get the concept in your comment, but then this seems to indicate that you don't understand the concept of 'bouma'. Whether it is true is another matter, which I regard as an open question. 

>bird against the sky

This example misses that identifying a letter in the middle of a word is significantly different from identifying a single shape against an even background. With all the crowding and with regular spatial frequency, something different is going on. In particular some kind of coding of sub-letter features is going on. Those on both sides of the divide--word recognition by single letter vs by word gestalt--agree that recognition of sub-letter features is involved. Whether for example the white counters in the o's in  "foot" are a feature that is recognized is to me an open question. What makes you so confident that counters are not used as a basis for either letter or word recognition?</div>

Well, truth be told, I'm not that confident. If you remember, my stance originated in response to claims about ‘designing the white’ and ‘the white being as important as the black’, which I think tend to be poses rather than describing actual design processes. My point was more about design than about reading: with very few notable exceptions, type designers design the black and the white happens as a byproduct. What we do with that byproduct during reading is, as you say, an open question. I believe variation in stroke weight and counter size -- from very light to very black types -- implies something in this regard, although I'm not sure what.

Re. boumas, I did not deny the role of sub-letter features; indeed, I made explicit reference to parts of letters in my initial post. My point is that parts of letters are, well, parts of <em>letters</em> and I find Hrant's notion of somehow making letters ‘less than themselves’ unconvincing.</div>

I don't believe the above, John, what is your basis for thinking it is just a "few notable exceptions"?
I have no idea what the majority may do nor can I see how you would "know" either.
Personally, as a type designer, I think it is impossible for me to see the black without seeing the white. I am not talking about reading performance, only design.

		<div class="commentbody">I think John is right about what we do unless you take extraordinary steps to do otherwise. Which I think we do in a limited sense when we check our spacing/kerning. But by then our willingness to reconsider shapes may be limited. It might be nice to have tools that encouraged/supported a different process. And we may one day. But until that happens...

Also on a practical level I am not sure that optimizing notan and evenness of white space is nearly as important or primary as I once did. I think making sure the feature set is obvious enough, and arranged well enough to support rapid letter recognition is actually the 1st consideration (letter level legibility). Once you have that then it is worthwhile to think about the harmony of the features, spacing in words, between words, lines, and ultimately notan. I should also say that I don't mean to diminish the value of visual evenness, notan or what have you. Instead it I am commenting on the question of priority.

Nevertheless what i am saying does seem to be essentially in contradiction to Hrant's recently stated point regarding letters being 'less than themselves'. I think the letters have got to be extraordinarily themselves in order to support letter level legibility. Not in showy or noticeable sense but in a deep sense. And this deep sense is culturally mediated, perceptual/optical rather than being in any way essential/mystical. The reason for this is that letter recognition is primary. 

Maybe I am misreading what Hrant means by this. It is a very squishy way of putting things.

Perhaps I should also explain where I get this idea from. It is a Pelli study:  Pelli DG, Tillman KA (2007) Parts, Wholes, and Context in Reading: A Triple Dissociation. PLoS ONE 2(8): e680. doi:10.1371/ 
journal.pone.0000680 

Also as Peter Enneson pointed out it is worth noting that Kevin Larson probably doesn't completely buy the whole word aspect of this study. ( Kevin?) But that is a separate issue.

Designing the whites, as you call it, is more apparent in a sans because sans don't so much follow a writing tradition as a drawing or construction tradition. The prevalence of monoline over contrasted sans further forces the issue and the bolder the weight the more the urgency. I find it totally impossible to design a bold sans without an equal partnership from black and white forms--to me, they are interdependent alter egos and inseparable anyway.
Traditional roman faces born of writing and calligraphy actually need the same uniformation but it is less visible due to the long ingrained penstroke tradition.

Yes, you are mistaken. :)

Eben mentioned spacing and kerning, which is the context in which one might think the whites and their relationships are most critical. But of course this is typically a secondary process after the letters have been drawn, during which initial process the internal whites have been defined primarily relative to the black <em>not relative to other whites.</em> Usually, there is an early stage in the design when one is testing a small number of trial letters in word or pseudo-word settings, but then pretty much everyone seems to jump straight into ‘filling out the glyph set’ and only returns to word settings in any systematic way at the kerning stage. And what is happening during kerning? One way to think about it is certainly in terms of balancing the whites, but if that were the case -- or all of the case -- then autospacing would be a breeze. It isn't a breeze because letter shape intrudes on the relationship of the whites. So I'm inclined to think of spacing and kerning in terms of grid arrangement, in which the relationship of the whites is one part but again secondary to the relationship of letter features, which need to remain independently legible. This is why I am not wholly convinced by David Kindersley's assertion that spacing should override letter distinction, even if this means allowing letters to overlap, and I think his illustration of this principle uses very carefully selected letterforms to make the argument more convincing than it would otherwise be.

I'm afraid I don't know what you mean by <em>see</em> -- presumably the italics indicate something like ‘really see’ or ‘see in some way other than normal people see’. Sometimes, when designing letters I think to myself ‘That's a nice counter shape’, but only after I've determined that the black is doing its job. Everyone sees the whites, and without seeing the whites we couldn't see the blacks, but that doesn't mean that the whites are featural. It is interesting that the bubble test -- sorry I don't have the paper reference handy; I know we've talked about it in another thread -- led to the identification of letter features necessary for recognition <em>and that all those features were parts of the figure -- the black letter --, not parts of the ground.</em></div>

Peter, from my experience there is definitely a "learning to see" experience, but it is hard to pin down exactly what one is learning to see. The "learning to see" is definitely a matter of learning how to evaluate letters in the presence of other letters, particularly in words. Basically it is a matter of what design of the letter best makes words "come together" as a gestalt. 

The whites may be a big part of this, but the fundamental experience is one of sensing visually rightness or wrongness in the presence of other letters, and analysis is secondary. When I analyze what might be changed to make a letter better I personally try to look at everything: weight of black strokes at different angles, relationship of terminals, letter widths, curves, stroke contrast, and size, harmony and vibrancy of the whites. But when it works it works, and when it doesn't it doesn't. So the analysis is sort of feeling your way to a solution, but claims about what is most important are always a little suspect, because all the factors interact, and nobody really knows. 

I do agree with Chris that the relationship of whites is also important in serif faces. I just noticed that its importance is more obvious for sans. 

So basically my view is that Frutiger's "designing the whites" is misleading, but still he has a point.  </div>

Peter,

I was reacting to the ‘white as by-product’ idea. I think Hrant and Noordzij are absolutely correct in trying to counter this idea. I thought it no longer existed amoung professional designers. 

I thought contours are defined and manipulated; the black is gauged; contours are adjusted; the whites are guaged; contours are readjusted, and so on until a kind of resolution of countervailing pressures is acheived.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, speaking from my still very limited experience as a fresh learner, I've found that I have indeed been learning to "switch" my vision around in the design process, i.e. trying to perceive the white as figure and the black as ground*; this has actually been very illuminating and has, I think, given me better results. Among other things, it has also led to a minor spacing epiphany.
(* Inverting the screen and zooming in on countershapes is a nice crutch to make this work better.)
However, I'm not sure type design education has directly helped me with this… I'm not sure generally how far one can be *taught* to <em>see</em> something – doesn't one inherently have to discover it oneself, actively, because one is looking to see it?</div>

John, you wrote: <i>It is interesting that the bubble test [...] led to the identification of letter features necessary for recognition and that all those features were parts of the figure — the black letter —, not parts of the ground</em>.

I'm not sure that this is what the following classification image using the bubbles technique on the word ‘javel’ suggests:

What I wonder though is whether those are a different animal, since they don't seem to be trying to make <em>surfaces</em>; to me it looks like laying down multiple pieces to create the impression of a letter. But maybe they're all on the same continuum.

BTW concerning Quintet, I wonder if Okano realizes how fundamentally different it is to the rest of KABK's output. Looking at the images in the ILT interview I would say that going from that double-pencil "B"* to the shapes in the actual font is a qualitatively huge leap. It's like walking versus flying.

Michael, can you provide examples? Of course it's not impossible that drawing the outlines (as opposed to the bodies) of letters chirographically is old news, but lacking any examples I would have to think you're wrong.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the link. But I have to say that's not the same thing - it just shows the <em>drafting</em> of outlines (which obviously has been happening for centuries). The main idea in this thread (to me) is the free-form chirographic rendering of outlines; sort of how chirographers think of the black, but applied to the outline (which has no thickness). One thing to look for is "funny" crossings of outlines (and not the sort that happens when you're marking the black - like the "o" in Peter's example).

But more potential examples would be great. The thing is if you have a point to make I think you should make the effort to provide evidence. I don't go on a wild-goose chase when I can't even hear the goose.

		<div class="commentbody">If I may attempt to moderate:

I think it is possible to acknowledge Michael's point that writing outlines of letters, i.e. suggesting structures by visualising the edges of stems instead of stroking them, is an old method that is familiar to anyone who has studied formal lettering. At the same time, within the varieties of forms producible by this method, there are distinctions to be made, as in stroked letters, between formal, constructed letters and informal, cursive letters, and Hrant is talking about the latter. Now, given that distinction, which requires one to look at how a thing is made as well as what it looks like, I'd say that Peter's Helmut Salden example, despite its flamboyance, is actually an example of the formal, constructed letter and hence, as Michael, says exactly the same sort of beast as the traditional versal letter. Okano's Quintet, on the other hand, is clearly distinct in that the outline is cursive. I do think Hrant is getting a little over excited, but that's his wont. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks John. There is the distinction between free form drawing/painting that Hrant is always trying to ascribe to what I do and what I really do. Calligraphy is not painting as he has asserted in his previous posts. And the distinction between what he has done, in his protoglyph (whatever the heck that is/means), is largely the difference between interpretive and formal calligraphy, i.e. Versals.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michael,
This reminds me of yet another technique with flat pen that I learned 50 years ago from Howard Glasser but forgot the proper name. The technique uses a flat pen but doubles the stroke.  As I understood it, it was used to make very large letters which would not be practical with a pen of that era.  Today, steel brushes do it with ease. Back then, the user could double the weight of a single pen stroke but increase the stroke contrast as desired. Any clue as to the name of the technique?</div>

I have not made myself clear, sorry.  The technique I am trying to describe can be done with any flat pen.  It was not a mounting of two pens together to draw a double stroke.  It was drawing the two strokes one after the other.  It was done with Roman Capitals.</div>

EDIT:
The odd thing is I found your drawing interesting/refreshing, and it is reminiscent of things that are occurring, and have been for some time, in the calligraphic field. GSE Briem in the early 80's etc. So I thought it would be interesting to add the calligraphic side to it, since that is where it emanated from. Far be it from me to stop you from shooting yourself in the foot in the pursuit of knowledge. </div>
