  body: Do a contextual click on the point &#40;Ctrl-click on Mac, Right-click on
    Windows&#41;. The context menu has various options, including connection type.
    <BR> <BR>You might want to pick up a copy of Leslie Cabarga&#39;s book, Learn
    FontLab Fast. I&#39;ve been working with FontLab for a long time, and I noticed
    a bunch of things in there about curve/point editing that I didn&#39;t know. <BR>
    <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: You can also just double-click the point, so the shape displayed next to it
    is an X &#40;instead of an O&#41;. Double-clicking toggles between smooth and
    sharp connections. <BR> <BR>Alan
