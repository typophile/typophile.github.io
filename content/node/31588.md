body: "I went to the California Antiquarian Book Fair this weekend and was struck
  by a number of things (mostly prices), but found one original copy of a sort of
  compendium of the graphic work of Chekhonin, and I recall seeing bits and pieces
  of his work lately. I've never seen such a terrific variety of things, and I just
  found it incredibly inventive and unusual, especially for the modernist times he
  was working in. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of an affordable source for reproductions
  of this designer's work? The collection I saw was specifically intended as a survey
  of his work only, no other artists. Even a comprehensive sampling of his work would
  be very interesting. "
