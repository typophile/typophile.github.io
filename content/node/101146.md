body: "hello\r\nWe need to make several books with handwriting text. This is textbook
  book for teaching childs in first class how to write.\r\nWe have one font for this
  purpose (look in attachment) but problem is that we need to choose \"link glyph\"
  (underline glyphs in attached picture) between every two glyphs and manually adjust
  kerning. This is looser work. We use indesign cs4 or cs6.\r\n\r\nWhat solution I
  have to can easy type text without manual kerning work? How to rebuild this font
  and use indesign tools for easy job?\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "This is one of the reasons why ligatures and OpenType features exist. If
    your font has \"link glyphs,\" as you imply, chances are it already has this support
    and all you need to do is enable them in InDesign. If said font lacks the features
    logic, it's a pain but not that hard to write a basic features file to enable
    them.\r\n\r\nIdeally, your font should automagically insert predesigned ligatures
    for many sequences of letters, using the link glyphs only as needed for exceptional
    cases.\r\n\r\nIt might be easier to choose a different font that has these capabilities
    -- doing it by hand can give great results (and you'll need to tweak it manually
    anyway) but it's a major pain, more trouble than it's worth."

  body: "Foler, if the font in question is deficient in terms of automatically connecting
    as you need, it can be fixed. If you have a budget for this sort of work there
    are many people on Typophile* who can carry out such a modification.\r\n\r\n*
