  anyone here have an opinion or experience with this company? Is it a reliable, trustworthy
  company one can seel fonts to with no further hassles or disappointments?

    about this offline, but your profile doesn't support recieving e-mails when you
    are not online. Can you e-mail me at dan@typeoff.de?\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Scriptorium/FontCraft have been around for quite a while, in fact I think
    they were one of the first independents to post a Web site. Dave Nalle was semi-regular
    on Typo-L but I can't say I've seen him active elsewhere online or at type conferences
    so it's difficult to form an opinion. His fonts certainly have a following - Tim
    Burton, and The Pirates of the Caribbean spring to mind. I would assume he's been
    reasonably successful to have stuck with it for so long, especially when other
    vendors have given up.    \r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n\r\n"

    I am certainly eager to hear some bit about the best options for dealing one's
    fonts with. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, Scriptorium has been on a long time now. They have
    specialized in antique fonts, some of them quite interesting. Since one of my
    almost-completed fonts is a conversion from a XVII-Century printed book, I found
    Scriptorium an option for wanting to distribute it. But I wanted to know an opinion
    on the foundry's seriousness.\r\n\r\nI'll also search for IHOF, Paul."
