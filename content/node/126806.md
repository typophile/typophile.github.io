body: "Mostly looking to ID the large green type.\r\n\r\n I'd also like to know the
  font above it, although it's probably the same family. I can probably find replacements
  for the bottom white text but the small green text is also something I'd like to
  match.\r\n\r\nAny insight/advice/direction is greatly appreciated!"
