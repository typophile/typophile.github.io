  it's Microsoft, not type designers that will suffer if the plan to support .zipped
  up fonts attached to Web pages is adopted by browser makers. Not sure I follow the
  logic, but oh well. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\nSee also the previous thread."

    but I was pretty impressed what ClearType was able to do considering the inputs.
    Yeah, it does jump a lot!\r\n\r\nSince most free web fonts have bad hinting or
    no hinting at all they might find a great use on the web, for big headlines!  :-)"

    because it's embedding permissions are set to \"installable\" - this was to contrast
    against a font like Georgia. \r\n\r\n  "
