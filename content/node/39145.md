body: "This is a quick and dirty trace job I did from an old Speedball Textbook (16th
  ed.). It took me about a week.\r\n\r\nThe original:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SB_poster_gothic_cond_5292.png]\r\nand
  my output:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/posterony_test_image_6559.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  spacing isn't perfect, and I had to create a couple letters to fill out the alphabet,
  plus all the extras for a complete MacRoman font. See the attached PDF for all that,
  and to peer into the fleshy curves.\r\n\r\nI made it in FontForge mostly using Spiro
  curves. They get a bit difficult to deal with though, since you have to convert
  them to Bezier curves to make a usable font and the procedure isn't fully optimized
  in the current version, requiring much manual tweaking, lest one get 5 or more Bezier
  points for each Spiro point on a curve."

  body: I don't know if you want to keep it true to the original, but I think the
    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and X are too wide. Y too narrow. Some characters are too heavy,
    like M, S, T and U. B is probably too light, as is C.

  body: "Oh I heartily agree they are imperfect. The numbers in general are much too
    heavy, and the N and X didn't even exist in the original. It is most assuredly
    time fore some cleanup, but I'm doing this mostly for the experience of translating
    hand-lettering to digital type, and there are flaws inherent in that process.\r\n\r\nI
    swear I've seen a similar commercial font somewhere, but I just can't place it
    in my mind. Hmm..."

    then there's no commercial font; I don't believe he has released a retail design
    yet. "

  body: Yeah, it does resemble Knip's style a bit (which isn't a problem). :)

  body: "Well, to include the arrows I'd have to *gasp* learn how to draw these letters
    properly, since I'll have to make them up for all the characters not in the original
    sample.\r\nI don't think I even have a Speedball A-1 nib."

  body: "Well, there are probably not many ways to draw the letters you added yourself.\r\nLooking
    at the image quickly shows that there are only horizontal strokes from left to
    right and downstrokes."
