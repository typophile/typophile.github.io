body: "Dear all,\r\n\r\nI need your help. I have created a font, then later changed
  the Em (from 2500 to 1000). Changing the size of the glyphs was not a problem. I
  now need to update the kerning table (by classes) because the kerns are too big
  (of course). I have tried with fontforge but I cannot seem to be able to upload
  the kerning table (I have saved an FEA file from the GPOS menu in Fontinfo).\r\n\r\nI
  am not sure I am being very clear, so please feel free to ask any question!\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: Export your kerning to an OpenType feature file. Load the font into Metrics
    Machine and then import the kerning from the feature file. Scale all of your kerning
    values to match the letter scaling, export that as a feature file, and then copy/paste
    it into an OpenType feature in Fontlab.

  body: "Thanks @Dunwich type (I do not have Fontlab but I appreciate the help).\r\nThanks
    @JanekZ: This is tremendously helpful. I tried exactly that (updating the fea
    file automatically in Open Office Calc) but without having deleted the original
    kern table so the \"Merge Feature Info\" bit did not appear. I'll try this when
    back at home tonight. Thanks muchly.\r\n\r\nPS. Am v jalous of how clean your
    fontforge looks!"
