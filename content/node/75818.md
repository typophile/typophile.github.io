body: "After many revisions of six weights of a font family, I want to compare all
  six outlines of the same glyphs together.  The aim is to adjust any glyphs that
  differ markedly from the others.\r\n  \r\nHere is one method I used in Fontlab but
  perhaps there is a better way? This method does not show the sidebearings. Any suggestions
  are welcome as to how to adjust the spacing uniformly for each of the six weights
  will be welcome. \r\n\r\nSay the fonts are named 1,2,3,4,5,6.  Open them all. Save
  6 as a new font called Multifont. Keep the other fonts open but do not work on them.\r\n\r\nOpen
  Multifont (it has the outlines of font 6). Select all glyphs, and keep them selected
  .\r\nTools/Mask / Assign Font Mask as 5. Save All. Tools/Mask /Copy Outlines to
  Mask. Save All. Tools/Mask /Swap Outline with mask. Save All.\r\nThis overlaps fonts
  6 and 5 in the Multifont.\r\nContinue the same process by assigning 4 as a mask
  and similarly 3,2,1. I ended up with all six outlines overlapping in each glyph
  of Multifont. Here is a screen shot of the glyph for Thorn, The lightest weight
  is obviously wrong (highlighted in the screen shot).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thorn_4505.JPG]"

    in Prepolator just make sure that the example interpolation works. Then eyeball
    comparisons on paper by formatting the fonts with a nested paragraph style that
    loops through character styles and repeats at the beginning of a word. If the
    masters are drawn correctly there shouldn\u2019t be anything strange going on
    that you won\u2019t see on paper, and it\u2019s easier to see what\u2019s going
    on with solid shapes than with a pile of outlines."

    That's possible? Oh man. \r\nHow do you tell ID to \xABloop through\xBB character

    is how to do it with four fonts:\r\n\r\n\u2022\_Set up your repeating characters
    as if they are words separated by spaced, eg. \u201CAAAA BBBB CCCC\u201D\r\n\u2022\_Create
    four character styles, one for each of the fonts\r\n\u2022\_Create a paragraph
    style and nest in each of the four character styles. One, two, and three operate
    \u201Cthrough 1 characters\u201D, four \u201Cthrough 1 words\u201D, and then add
    a final style to \u201Crepeat through last 4 styles\u201D.\r\n"

    Claudio! Indeed I am extrapolating to six weights the Latin glyphs of the two
    weights of the Arabic AlQuds family. Your generous and careful craftsman-like
    revision of my two Latin fonts (added to the revisions by another kind volunteer)
    is anything but automated. And yes no MM interpolation was used. I will revise
    the capital Thorns thanks.\r\n\r\nI now understand that Autopsy (which wins the
    prize for the most gruesome logo for an excellent software, after the original
    roadkill logo of Irfanview ! :)) and Prepolator are OK for Arabic since they only
    compare individual glyphs not text strings. Everything considered I think I will
    just use the method I outlined above (graphic pun intended) and a similar method
    using layers in Illustrator to compare the glyphs. Thanks to all."
