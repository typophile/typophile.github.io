  apparently digitized by Paul Baker in 1995. Anyone know of a source for this? <BR>

  body: Gerald <BR> <BR>Somewhat irrelevant to your question, but Paul Hayden Duensing
    engraved it in 14 point from the drawings which he borrowed from his friend, Robert
    Hunter Middleton. I believe the matrices have been dispersend between two or three
    friend of Paul. It is possible the Andromaque mats are with Rich Hopkins, publisher
    of the ATF Newsletter, and founder of The American Typecasting Fellowship. <BR>

  body: An old post, but still . . . as I was curious about Baker's Andromaque as
    well . . . I thought I would add for the sake of posterity that the original Andromaque
    matrices are at Wells College in Aurora NY. When I was director at their Book
    Arts Center plans with in motion to purchase from Stan Nelson a hand mould outfitted
    to hand-cast metal sorts from the original matrices. (Yes, I was channelling my
    inner James Mosley a la Rare Book School demonstrations.) Plans fell through when
    a new Dean took over and withdrew support for the Center in hopes of shutting
    it down and selling off its assets.
