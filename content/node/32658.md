        Greek Helvetica in the early 70's.\r\nSecondly, as Dieter Hofrichter has worked

    that the ogonek design showed little input from an ogonek expert (ie. Adam Twardoch
    or Fillip Balzek) so led Chris to believe that maybe the Greek was done without
    Greek consultation. Glad to hear that wasn\u2019t the case.\r\n\r\nHowever if
    anyone can think of a joke, or better yet a pun, involving the ogonek and Greek
    consultants then Chris can. I\u2019ll start him off\u2026 \u201CGerry and Kimis

    but not so in the bolder weights. As for the Cyrillic, I think it is modeled on
    the authentic Akzidenz Grotesk Cyrillic which was offered by the St Petersburg
    branch of H Berthold AG in the early 20th century. \r\n\r\nMost certainly, the
