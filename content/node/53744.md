body: "...Gonna take me a lot of pictures...\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poboy_Truck_4468.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is a truck that allegedly stalks my afternoon escort, Corey. According to Corey,
  it's everywhere. I can think of far more grim followers... but we enjoyed reversing
  roles and sniping a picture from the roof of the parking garage we parked on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Castillo_Restaurant_5166.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  mildly in love with the idea of using a building as a billboard. Sure, the drones
  inside don't get the luxury of windows, but the outdoor drones get to revel in their
  edificial endorsement.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sarlin_6279.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  reminds me of Sardi's in New York. I suppose my obtrusive height brings me to empathize
  with the obnoxiously oversized (yet elegant and swan-like) S. It gives me an example
  to follow. I should idolize this letter. Sure, I might feel like Dorothy in Munchkinland
  sometimes... but lightning only finds the tallest trees worth getting acquainted
  with. That might not be the best analogy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Everything_Shoppe_4299.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Walgreen_5644.jpg]\r\n\r\nTwo
  very different kinds of Everything Shoppes, and I'm absolutely wallowing in the
  difference in the signs. Walgreen's looks to me perfectly 1950s, and I'm not sure
  why. The Everything Shoppe is just straightforwardly what it is, in the self-accepting,
  Peter Behrens let's-not-lie-to-ourselves-you're-not-interested-in-a-contrived-purpose-so-let's-wallow-in-what-I'm-here-for
  sort of way. A pleasant way. I like it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Papp_6720.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  really didn't mean to get the sketchy black van in the shot, but Papp's seems conducive
  to shady things. I love that the actual sign is gone, and just the weathered components
  are left behind. Ahhh.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Krystal_3483.jpg]\r\n\r\nCan
  you say quintessential diner? Corey and I shared a shake. While it was listed on
  the menu as \"MilkQuake,\" I found that too embarrassing to say publicly and was
  altogether relieved when they knew what I was talking about when I said \"A vanilla
  shake please.\"\r\n\r\nI have a few more left... but I'll upload them shortly. Woohoo!"
