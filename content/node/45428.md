body: "I posted in the wrong Forum so I am cross posting here. My apologies.\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nI
  have been working as an IxD on enterprise level software for one of the largest
  IT companies in the world and am finally going to force a design decision through
  all our software and need some feedback from the experts.\r\n\r\nOur software is
  mostly of the legacy desktop variety, with a few web and mobile applications. We
  are working on a strategy for combining all our UI\u2019s into a common technology,
  but have yet to make a firm decision (Java, WPF, or AIR, I am familiar with all).
  All of our technology is moving towards RIA\u2019s. But I may be working with all
  the UI technologies under the sun for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nUp until now,
  we have avoided this issue by using system fonts. All users are on XP or Vista,
  so until I came on board, all our apps were using MS Sans and MS Serif, for the
  most part. System fonts. I want to use better screen fonts that are non-system.
  I am not talking display graphics here, I am talking about embedded app fonts.\r\n\r\nMy
  old boss, Stefan Kjartansson is a serious typographer, and he instilled in me a
  serious respect for font licensing, so I want some serious answers here.\r\n\r\nWith
  Flash and Silverlight (and Proce55ing), you have the ability to download font outlines
  remotely, and then remove them after the user exits the application. Fine for the
  free and open web, and emergent free, open source productivity tools in AIR etc.(37
  signals manages to make money somehow) But it doesn\u2019t work with propritory
  RIA\u2019s where the primary modality is offline use. And actually, I have a big
  issue with the enabling web technology that allows designers to skirt font licensing,
  but that\u2019s another topic.\r\n\r\nI know some guys I worked with at TATA that
  have been doing Flash e-learning apps for the last 8 years or so just never implement
  designs with non-system fonts because they already went through a licensing process
  and couldn\u2019t work out a deal, supposedly. The fonts have to be part of the
  end user install. I just don\u2019t take that at face value. Since we also have
  SOA apps, we no longer have engineers going on site to install our software. Users
  can download and install apps based on their licensing agreement with our company.\r\n\r\nSo
  our company has hundreds of licensing models that are of the 100 page TPS report
  style. I am not sure how to even put a proposal together for a font house as I am
  going to have to get our lawyers involved due to the complexity.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n1)
  Has anyone successfully licensed and implemented a non-system font into enterprise
  software (multi-lingual) with WPF, AIR, Nimbus? I have done it in web and chat apps,
  want to get feedback from enterprise folks.\r\n2) What were your challenges? What
  worked for you? How did you approach the font houses?\r\n3) If any font house reps
  come on here, what is your stance on all of this? Am I just way off on this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAnd
  Sorry for the long post! I just didn\u2019t see anything in the forumns on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
