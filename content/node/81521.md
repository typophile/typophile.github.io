  and/or their logo my client still hasn't send it to me yet. I am editing a video
  for him and need to include some text.\r\n\r\nClient website:\r\n\r\nhttp://2mackay.com/\r\n\r\nThe
  font that interest is the one used in the top logo for \"Groupe MacKay\". I have
  no idea if it is custom or not so if any of you has a something close in mind that
  would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks and Happy Easter,\r\n\r\nPhil"

    | Futura]] designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Renner | Paul Renner]].
    However in the logo 'MACKAY' seems to be tweaked. \r\n\r\nSB"

  body: My first gut feeling as well, but why would the logo designer (who let's generously
    say is perhaps not the gretest typographer in the world) go through the trouble
    of constructing an entirely different /K/ when Eras's is perfectly servicable?
    I'm still betting it's something else, maybe an Eras clone.
