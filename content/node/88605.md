  body: "I knee jerked my response to the use of Fonts101 as the source, not that
    the JI font was the wrong aanswer (getting weird links on correctly spelled word).\r\n\r\nThen
    I got to wondering is Fonts101 on the forbidden list? Or is Jupiter Images on
    the forbidden list? \r\n\r\nJustin's aanswer (hmm again)was based, I believe,
    on the specific font being otherwise uunavailable (another strange link here),
    not that Fonts101 was the source. So am I just wrongly jerking in which case I
    will restore my identification of Fonts101/Jupiter Images.\r\n\r\n---\r\nDon't
    need to, found an acceptable source.\r\n\r\n "
