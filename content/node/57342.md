  Design Standards]] and the [[http://www.decodeunicode.org/|Decode Unicode]] fairly
  helpful but am still a bit confused and not sure if I've done things right.\r\n\r\nI
  have periodcentered (U+00B7) and hyphenationpoint (U+2027) the same. It's a full
  stop (period) centred on the x-height, whilst bulletoperator (U+2219) is the same
  but centred on the figure height. Is this conventional?\r\n\r\nThe advance width
  is the same as full stop (period), but perhaps they should be set on an en-space?\r\n\r\nMy
  bullet is a larger rounded rectangle centred on the cap height...should this be
  just a circle or is it ok to have it stylistically harmonising with the overall
  shape of the font? Actually my numerals are the same height as caps in this font.\r\n\r\nAnd
  which of these should I gpos using the case feature for cap alignment? All of them?\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much in advance :)"

  body: "I don't know all the formal uses of the period centered -- sometimes, in
    English, it is used as a bullet. There s another \"centered period\" in the mathematicl
    codepoint region that signifies multiplication in math, and conjunction in some
    notational systems of formal logic. That one should likely be a bit bigger than
    a full stop. If there is only one \"technical\" centered period codepoint (I don't
    remember), positon is an issue. Usually numbers (for math) are lining. But in
    logic, expressions typically use lower-case alphas. Guess I'd go with the numbers.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know of a formal use of U+00B7. It does show up sometimes in linguistic
    constructions. It is also frequently used when the bullet character in the font
    is too big, & it is easier for the comp to slighly enlarge periodcenterd than
    to reduce the bullet.\r\n\r\nWhich gets us to the limits of responsibility of
    the font designer. You will not be able to please everybody. Text is different
    than display. When I was learning the trade, a 2-point bullet at text size (call
    that 10-point type) was considered about right. That means, if you measure the
    \"black\" of the bullet, it is 2 points, 0r 200/1000 em. That may have changed
    in our new, brave world where branding is everything. Most bullets in the font
    were far larger. If you set them at a smaller size, you had to also raise them
    up. Same with a period centered that was to small -- except setting them in a
    larger size meant you had to move them down.\r\n\r\nYou should have at least one
    bullet character that is a round bullet. If not, sure as shooting some editor,
    graphic designer, author (client) will object. If your want your design of the
    bullet to be standard, allow switching to the round bullet via a stylistic set.\r\n\r\nUsually,
    a bullet is used with the following word beginning with a cap, but not always.\r\n\r\nSidebearings
    are also up in the air. The usual list structure is \"flush & hang,\" & I, anyway,
    use tabs. Too large a sidebearing get in the way of the \"flush.\" The space on
    the right is controlled by the tab. But there are cases where a sort of paragraph
    style is used with a bullet, so some space is needed. I'd say about 100 units.
    If the comp wants more, they can insert a thin space.\r\n\r\nIn short, give the
    comp something to work with, and down't worry overmuch.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Odd yes, let me check...looks like somehow the bulletoperator had slipped
    down 3 units and the rasterisation is totally different. Thanks for spotting :)
    I've fixed it now. The sidebearings are less than periodcentered (70 units vs
    85). The actual blob is identical. There's also U+2023 which is a triangular bullet
    a similar optical size to the square one above. Hope I'm also right in using periodcentered
    (nudged up slightly) for Ldot and ldot.\r\n\r\nI think I've also figured out dashes,
    hyphens and minus finally, and straight quotes vs curly quotes vs prime/double/triple
    primes. Seems there's no fully comprehensive 'type encyclopedia' for glyph design.
    Wait, no, there's Typophile! :D"

  body: "I find the information structure on that Microsoft index really confisung.
    AFAIK periodcentered and middot are two names for the same codepoint...U+00B7
    seems to be named differently inside different fonts...in fact bulletoperator
    doesn't appear in many fonts unless I'm mistaken.\r\nMy thinking was that U+00b7
    should be for bulleted lists (so has larger sidebearings), whilst U+2219 was for
    mathematical 'multiply' as Charles mentioned above. Middot seems to be ambiguous.
    \r\nI wonder if anyone else can shed some light here? Otherwise I'll have to investigate
    all the fonts on my system to see how they deal with it all. Gross :(\r\nTrying
