  Howerver I have no idea what the font of letters in the logo is.\r\n\r\nI am new
  to anything about fonts. I also suspect that this logo might have been originally
  handwritten therefore I don't know if you can actually help me.\r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8b/Seal_of_the_Dominican_Order.png[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Seal_of_the_Dominican_Order_3832.png],\r\n\r\nThank
  you"

    and R is more curvy, otherwise perfect match.\r\n\r\n"
