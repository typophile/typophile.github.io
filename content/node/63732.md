  creating some artwork for them, I felt it was time to dive in and try my hand at
  it.  Let me know what you think :)\r\n\r\nThe piece is called \"Inspiration\", and
  took me about 57 hours to complete and is over 50 layers in photoshop.\r\n\r\n[[http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z6/Cutless1/Inspiration.png|Click

  body: A part from the typos (as noted elsewhere http://typophile.com/node/63731
    ), I like it, but find the word "inspiration" a bit not enough legible.
