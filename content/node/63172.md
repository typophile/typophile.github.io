  similar to SEGA's 'Afterburner Climax', and i'm looking for heading and body fonts.\r\n\r\nI
  like the italic, smooth feel of Ray Larabie's [[http://www.dafont.com/stasmic.font|Stasmic]]
  but i'm worried it may be a little too light and difficult to read, even as a heading
  font. \r\n\r\nAnyone fancy suggesting some suitable heading/title and body fonts?
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nDan."

    a games design background, so could probably work out the right licensing model
    too. '

  body: "Thanks for all your comments.\r\n\r\n@ sii\r\n\r\nWe have actually used Ray
    before so a custom font is an option.\r\n\r\n@ Fontgrube\r\n\r\nYes, that's where
    I found Stasmic.\r\n\r\n@ PvdL\r\n\r\nI find Feisar/Feisar Express a little too
    \"alien/retro\" for what i'm doing with this front end. On the other hand, I'm
    not looking for something too futuristic either.\r\n\r\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/687/headerbodycomparison.gif

    thinking perhaps Century Gothic Italic, though i'm far from convinced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd probably recommend Neuropol. It's techy/alien without being too complicated
    you cant read it. I've seen a show on Discovery or the History Channel use it
    exclusively for the intro to some program.
