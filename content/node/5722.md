  body: Thank you to all of you. <BR>I do enjoy Typophile. <BR>I leave you a text
    I like. <BR>Sincerely, <BR>AS <BR> <BR> <BR>Seeing yourself <BR> <BR>&#39;When
    you look at your companions, try to see yourself&#39; <BR>said the Japanese teacher
    Okakura Kakuso. <BR> <BR>&#39;But isn&#39;t that an awfully selfish attitude?&#39;
    asked a disciple. <BR>&#39;If we are always concerned about ourselves, <BR>we
    will never see the good things that others have to offer.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;If
    only we did always see the good things in others,&#39; <BR>replied Kakuso. &#39;But
    the truth is that when we look at <BR>another person, we are only looking for
    defects. <BR>We try to discover his wicked side because we want him <BR>to be
    worse than us. We never forgive him when he hurts <BR>us because we do not believe
    that we would ever be <BR>forgiven. We manage to wound him with harsh words, <BR>declaring
    that we are telling the truth, when all we are <BR>doing is trying to hide it
    from ourselves. <BR>We pretend that we are important so that no one else <BR>will
    see how fragile we are. That is why whenever you <BR>judge your brother, be aware
    that you are the one <BR>who is on trial.&#39; <BR> <BR>
