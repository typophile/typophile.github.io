body: I recently posted a request for a font to be identified on the Type Identification
  Board and received a rapid reply.  I was reviewing a document and saw a font used
  that I liked.  While trying to track down that font &#40;Bank Gothic&#41;, I realized
  that in order for a sheet to print with that font used, it would have to have been
  installed on that machine &#40;at least I think so&#41;.  How does one know if the
  font they are using is being done so legally?   <BR> <BR>All Microsoft Windows machines
  are provided with a certain preloaded package of fonts which I would assume implies
  that they &#40;the fonts&#41; can be used for any purpose.  Is there a standard
  set of fonts that is &#34;free&#34; or available for unlimited public use?  For
  instance, Arial and Times New Roman would appear to be universally approved for
  unlimited use.  Is there, for lack of a better description, a regulatory body that
  controls this?   <BR> <BR>I searched through the directory structure of several
  computers at work and compared the font lists in each and they are all different.  The
  majority of fonts were common, but each had files available exclusive to that particular
  machine.  How does Microsoft or Apple/Macintosh decide which fonts are loaded when
  a machine is built?  Do they pay royalties to someone?  Does someone own the rights
  to fonts as common as Times New Roman or Arial?   <BR> <BR>I appreciate any time
  anyone could give me in answering these questions.  Typography was something I took
  for granted until recently but it is fascinating.  I have found several font sites
  and will sit and surf and critique &#40;to myself&#41; fonts now.  It really is
  amazing the diversity that exists. <BR>  <BR>Thanks again! <BR>   <BR>PS  Does anyone
  &#40;or everyone&#41; know who is credited &#40;if there is someone&#41; with creating
  the &#34;Jackdaws loves my big sphinx of quartz&#34; tagline for display of all
  letters of the alphabet?

  body: Most of the fonts bundled with MacOS, and many older versions of Adobe applications
    were licensed from other foundries. &#40;Helevtica, for instance, which ships
    with MacOS, is licensed from Linotype; it is not owned by Apple&#41;. <BR> <BR>Adobe
    has its own type library, which has grown over the years. I believe that Thomas
    posted here some time ago that Adobe was no longer bundling non-Adobe fonts with
    their software. Was that for all applications, or just some? In any event, even
    Adobe fonts that come &#34;free&#34; with Adobe products are covered by the software&#39;s
    license. So, one cannot do whatever one wants with them &#40;like freely distribute
    copies, etc&#41;. In this regard, bundled fonts are no different from fonts that
    you would license from a foundry on your own, except that some foundries have
    more restrictive EULAs, and some have less restrictive ones.
