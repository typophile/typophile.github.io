  body: Well, you probably don&#39;t care any more, Rob, but I know that the forum
    <BR>participants are gnashing their teeth, desirous of knowing the identity <BR>of
    that grungy script. Or maybe not ... <BR> <BR>It seems to have begun its life
    as a version of a typeface that appears <BR>in the Solotype Catalog as Chopin.
    Dieter Steffmann digitized it as <BR><a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/c/chopin.htm"
    target="_blank"> Chopin Script</a>. Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nb_ppp=40&amp;texte=News&amp;nq=1&amp;q=chopin"
    target="_blank"> another</a> Chopin Script by a &#39;Diogenes&#39;. And you <BR>can
    also find it as <a href="http://members.dca.net/pheanix/msie/c5.htm" target="_blank">
    Chase Callas</a> by the defunct Soft Horizons. <BR> <BR>One of these, or yet another
    version, seems to have begat <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nb_ppp=40&amp;texte=News&amp;nq=1&amp;q=radagund"
    target="_blank"> Radagund</a>, <BR> which I believe to be the font used. <BR><br>
