  again...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1stchoice-ID_4728.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  uppercase E and the ampersand should be the dead giveaway - I initially went through
  the usual suspects (I went straight to Meta), and now I'm thinking it's a blatantly
  obvious face I'm missing somewhere along the line.\r\n\r\nWell, it *is* Monday after
  all\u2026\r\n\r\nAny help in this would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\ns "

    for this ID or is that too much like shill bidding?) :)\r\n\r\ns"
