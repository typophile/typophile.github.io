  body: ' Right now it&#39;s a big, lovable mess. There are lots of interesting individual
    characters, but they&#39;re not hanging together as a whole. <BR> <BR>I think
    the most successful characters are the ones with the greatest thick/thin contrast:
    F,G,S,T,L,3. I&#39;d like to see that top- or bottom-heavy approach applied throughout.
    <BR> <BR>Not sure the pixel/stair-stepping technique works for the Z,2 or 7 either.
    You might consider applying the rounded corner approach of the K. <BR> <BR>The
    double lump of the I and W is cool, too. More of that, maybe? '

  body: Hi John, I think I am seeing several designs within this one. I like the grouping
    of the 1,2,7,Z as they are all thin by the use of single  <BR>block , the A,B,C,D,O,P,Q,0,8
    work well together but the rest do not work smoothly together as a unit. the X
    is something else, my favorite character.  <BR> <BR>here is a few designs from
    around the world that use a similar design concept and in my opinion did a really
    nice job. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1047.jpg"

  body: 'Thanks for the advice, guys! <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always loved Stadia although
    it turns out that it&#39;s a revival of a much older font created in the Bauhaus
    way back when... interesting story. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a partial redesign: <BR>

    weighted at the bottom is a good thing? Or should it be more consistent?'

  body: I think the Bauhaus font was slightly different perhaps something more like
    this one below . This one I believe was redone by Henrik Kuble &#40;Danish&#41;
