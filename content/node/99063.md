    does \u201Cof the year\u201D require that the favorite be new this year?\r\nWhatever,
    I would never favorite a revival (e.g. Benton), unless there were some remarkably
    novel method of resuscitation involved, which is the case with Karloff."

    body: "favorite in my opinion can be both: most admired and most used. \r\n\r\nI'm
      a graphic designer who wants to learn more about typography then what I learned
      in school... which is almost nothing. So excuse me for picking fonts just based
      on first look, and not looking in to that deeper, since I never really learned
      to do that. As a graphic design student we learned a bit of everything, but
      nothing in-depth.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to learn about typography from you guys
      and from other resources on the net. \r\n\r\nAlso trying to contribute to the
      forum, and not just asking away and never giving back.\r\n"

    pretty quirky. I bought the set packaged as \"for Letterpress,\" and that's what
    I intend to use it for. The small caps with a bit of spacing are extremely elegant,
    while the bolder italic is so curious -- I think it's got a bit of the ugly in
    it (referring to Karloff, here), but in an endearing way!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Fair enough, but for one thing all the fonts you mentioned are older than
    2012. Or maybe you meant fonts that you/we personally admired and/or used most
    in 2012? In my case though the answer wouldn't change.  :-)\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/91425\r\n\r\nBTW
    one useful skill to acquire is the ability to spot (and avoid) fonts that are
    merely posers, that leech off of existing designs. There's a lot of those, especially
    these days.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to trash your selections\u2014I was just exploring the idea you introduced, and
    moving the thread along. If those were your favorite fonts, they were your favorite
    fonts. Next year, your criteria might change. I would no doubt have pimped one
    of my own designs\u2014if I had published any in 2012!"

  body: "Thanks guys for giving me the space to learn ;)\r\n\r\nAbout Benton and Karloff
    ... since I'm a rookie here, I'll explain why I like Benton:  it's because Benton
    looks wider than Karloff, I tend to like wider fonts more, because they seem more
    \"friendly\". \r\n\r\nAs for hrant, the fonts I chose are fonts that I used over
    a year ago, but I'm still happy about. They don't have to be new. Like Coca-Cola
    is this years favorite drink, although Coca-Cola already exists for so long.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I would love to discover more fonts by more listmakers :)"

    occasional job were Brioni by Typotheque and National by Klim/Village. And my
    sig-font Locator by ProcessType. \r\nI didn\u2019t buy as much as I did in other
    years, but amongst those were KLTF Tiptoe, News Gothic (didn\u2019t have the OT-version
    yet, and it has been a fav for 30 years), LT Vesta, LT Neue Frutiger Condensed
    (the new additions, have to keep up), Fontspring Nexa, FF Akko Rounded. \r\nAnd
    I confess that I took advantage of some offers of free fonts (the stock market
    did not quite perform to expectations\u2026 So there was a need for that).\r\nNext
    year I am going to produce my second font and hopefully recoup some of the expense
    : )"

    and released as a Libre font for Google Webfonts [img:sites/default/files/old-images/02almendra02_5804.gif]\r\n\r\nWilmington
    by Bomparte is also very impressive to me.\r\nIt really looks like natural writing
    if you activate 'salt' and 'calt' OT features. \r\nThat's not easy to get right,
    but this one works like a charm.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/wilmington-bf/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    me, but the way the three family members are formally related to one another by

    a great book face, and I love how it feels old and new at the same time, soft

    excited about the design before that. :)"
