  body: "Rare is indeed rare. After digging through my usual suspects, including those
    listed by Ryuk, plus P-22, T-24, HiH, Wiesher and Spiece Graphics I still did
    not spot it. Either I missed it in my quick scanning, or it's elsewhere -- if
    it's a font.\r\nDon"

  body: "Funny because the only one that reminds me of nothing is 'RARE' :D. Looks
    too much deconstructed/eroded/manipulated/distorted to be something else than
    hand-drawn (and rather close actually to Jon Contino's lettering style) and mixing
    style of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/windsor|Windsor]] and 'Grant' [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-grants-antique|Grants
    Antique]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/sheridan-gothic-sg|Sheridan
    Gothic]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/refugio-wbw|Refugio]]/[[http://opti.netii.net/fonts-g/index.htm|Grant

    substitutes for 'THE FINEST QUALITY'."

  body: "Your best chance is may be asking directly [[http://dribbble.com/AdamTrageser|Adam
    Trageser]] but I'm afraid the answer would be (part of 'MEDIUM') mostly hand-drawn
    or so much customized that to me it would be quite helpless to know the original
    font. I'd risk some though [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-gothic|Sackers
    Gothic]] for '& COMPANY' and the usual [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead|Letterhead]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-billhead-1890|Billhead]]
    for 'THE FINEST QUALITY'. But as said, would need a lot of customization to get
    only loosely close.\r\nNow some food for the mind: [[http://joncontino.com|Jon
    Contino]], [[http://decadetypefoundry.bigcartel.com|Decade Type Foundry]], [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead

  body: "RARE. As it appears that this is a well hidden font, or not a font at all,
    the question is whether you would like to have an alphabet with similar style.
    Some of the letters, such as the flat top A could be derived from the list posted
    by Ryuk. The swoop for the upper bowl of R, and similar letters such as B, C and
    P could be modeled on Sveva http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astype/sveva-as-versal/.
    \ Big bowls on Windsor, Milton etc.\r\nDon"
