body: I've learned that Adobe applications their own text engines for Opentype fonts.
  Adobe still doesn't support Myanmar Opentype yet (like many other indic based scripts).
  But very basic feature ligature is supported. So I tried developing a font using
  ligature only for reshaping Burmese characters listing every possible combinations
  (2200+ glyphs for Burmese script only). It works for CS3/4 in both Photoshop and
  Indesign and Photoshop CS5. But in my surprise, Indesign CS5 and 5.5 doesn't support
  any opentype feature for Myanmar script even after world-ready composer is enabled.
  Is there any work-around for this problem? Thanks.
