body: I know this doesn't deal directly with type and typography but more so design
  in general. I am in the process of drafting suitable terms and conditions for a
  design contract (my first time doing so). I was wondering if anyone had resources/references
  to point me to in this area, it has been suggested to me to ask other designers
  for their contracts but I thought I would post here and see if there are other options
  first.

    he might have some information as well.
