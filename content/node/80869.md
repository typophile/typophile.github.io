  body: "Drogowskaz is based on the Polish road sign typeface, with its strange clipped
    e.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polish_4512.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've never
    seen it used outside of that context before.\r\n\r\n[[http://fonts.gestalten.com/planeta.html|Planeta]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque/|Brandon Grotesque]]
    are two other currently popular contenders for this look."

    a lot. Wish it were complete.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nIf anything else comes
    up, I'll keep checking back."
