  no Repeated Elements\" which is supposed to influence font-weight. Can somebody
  please explain this design characteristic as well as why it influences weight? It
  would be great to have other examples to look at.\r\n\r\nAttached is an image of
  one example of the design characteristic.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_4933.png]"
