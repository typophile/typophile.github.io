  body: "It looks like they used [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/felix/|Felix]]
    and borrowed a U from some other font.\r\n\r\nYou can see it better here:\r\nhttp://www.southernproper.com/store/gentlemen/prep-belts.html\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the site uses [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trajan/|Trajan]] \r\n\r\n"
