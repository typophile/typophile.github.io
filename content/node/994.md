  body: 'Hi Ramiro, <BR> <BR>If you have the resources and opportunity, definitely
    check out the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunstern &#40;Royal Academy of
    Visual&#91;or Fine?&#93; Arts&#41; in the Hague, the Netherlands. The URL is  <BR>
    <BR><A HREF="http://www.kabk.nl/" TARGET="_top">http://www.kabk.nl/</A> <BR> <BR>This
    is the #1 place I wish I had the time, resources and qualifications to study at.
    Reading and Leipzig are tied for second, though if I found a place in Austria
    or Switzerland, they might take over second. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I don&#39;t think
    there are any accredited full-time type design programs inside the U.S., but I
    would be truly delighted to be proven wrong.'
