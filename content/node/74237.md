  body: It appears to match closely the showing of Original Caslon Oldface in <em>Printing
    Types of the Word</em>...

  body: I think the running heads and the body copy are two different typefaces; the
    former may well be Aldine, but the As which appear in the body copy are very Caslonish...

  body: 'I think the A''s aren''t wide enough. Also the dots over the i''s light and
    to the right show that it''s earlier, I think. Caslon always did his dots heavier
    and more centered. Also the e is too narrow. '

  body: frequentative use of "e caudata" attest it is much older (Frobenius, Garamond,
    Jannon era IMO)

    Van Krimpen is 20th. But Van Krimpen was trying to channel Christophel van Dijck,
    and this font could be from van Dijck''s hand. '

  body: In fact, it looks a lot like Torrentino of Florence, Italy (c. 1550) (p. 163
    of Updike's Printing Types). I'm not definite about this, but I see a strong resemblance
    with many of the characters.

  body: "Litterae Annuae Insularum Phillipinarum, dated 1604, by Francesco Vaez, is
    noted in Google Books, but without a preview (presumably it was not scanned).\r\n\r\nThere's
    a slim possibility it might be the book in the picture.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's a
    letter, and the book has large pages. However, that letter appeared in <em>Relatione
    Breve</em> by D. de Torres in 1603, so that's another possibility for the book
    scanned. The title page of that book is visible here:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4548405]]\r\n\r\nOh,
    wait: these earlier volumes of the Jesuit annual letters are on Google, and they're
    not all in italics:\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.com/books?id=Awc8AAAAcAAJ]]\r\n\r\nso
    that might be what is sought. (The page headings aren't right, though.)"

  body: "Jacob, can you tell us where this book comes from? I would think it is from
    a library or collection, and there would be more information about its title,
    author, place of publication, which might give a clue as to the date, and narrow
    down the options on font. \r\n\r\nBut I think  identifying this early stuff is
    very tricky. For example, there is both a narrow and a wide \"n\" in your sample.
    Are they from two different fonts? What David shows above also has both a slanted
    and horizontal crossbar on the e. Again, two fonts mixed?"
