    in your sample...]\r\n[EDIT 2: GROUP might be the same font, although a bit more
    condensed.]"

    respectively \u2013 except for the fact that they contain 53,000 glyphs each.\r\n\r\nso,
    good news for <em>Special-K</em>: chances are, Andale Mono is present on your
    system already, as it comes with both Mac OS X and Windows. it's a monospaced
    font. still, you could create short strings of text such as \"gabriel\" with very
    little editing; \"GROUP\" seems unmodified."
