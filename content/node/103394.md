  body: "Must have been some variation in sets of the old Vogue. Your specimen resembles
    Intertype Vogue Bold but has the Q tail in the vertical position of the Extra
    Bold. Your e and g look like the ones from Kabel. Here is the character set of
    both weights.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IntertypeVogueBoldAndXtrBold@33_5339.jpg]\r\nAs
    Mark says, nothing digital.\r\nDon"

  body: "Vogue had alternate characters that enabled it to imitate the look of Futura
    or Kabel. Your first sample shows Vogue with some of the Kabel-like alternates
    (the bolder sample has the \u201CKabel\u201D lowercase t as well). The original
    poster\u2019s sample shows the standard characters."
