    typeface and logo, which means, that I did not take the very darker ones into
    consideration because of the big contrast. And the rest is just feeling.'

    a little too rigid compared to the logo.\r\nI like #3, but, as Arno said, it's
    too dark."

  body: "I'd agree that #2 is perhaps best in terms of fitting with the style of the
    mark (but maybe it's really a tad too spiky); I'd think #3 is too plump. And perhaps
    obviously, anything [strongly] slanted would make zero sense with that mark, and
    a name with \xABbalance\xBB in it.\r\nAll that said, without knowing the context
    it's really impossible to say what kind of font you should pick: with a script
    font this seems more yoga/dance-y, whereas paired with a sans it might come across
    more sporty or wellness-like. Stylistic matching isn't the only dimension to consider."

    What typeface is that?'

  body: "I'd like #3, but I'd want the line weight in the illustration plumped up
    to match. \r\n\r\n#2 is good, and does match the line weight better, but with
    the rigid vertical flag pole, I think the vertical straightness of #3 works better.
    \r\n\r\nSmall nitpick on the logo...I'd like to see the hands above not quite
    meet, just as the feet below don't quite close in . "

  body: "My choice was #3. I do see that the line weights don't match so I may have
    to adjust the logo accordingly. Unless someone has a similar type to recommend
    that matches the weight better. I also think I will tuck the type under the bent
    knee and try to connect the \"b\" in banlance to the foot.\r\n\r\nA bit of background.
    This logo is for a golf and yoga seminar company. The target demo is women aged
    25+ in a higher income bracket.\r\n\r\nThanks for all of the imput. I will post
    an upadated version as soon as possible."

  body: I still find Cocktail Shaker slightly too plump/round/short/comfy for this
    job, but if you do go with it I'd maybe try making the crossbar of the "t" less
    prominent (shorter).

    I want to be able to separate them for golf balls and other swag.\r\n\r\n@altaira
    I do see it as too plump as well. I'm going to have to look for something else.
    Any suggestions for an upright script?"

  body: "I like the mark plumper, for sure. There's still an inconsistency in the
    line quality between the mark and the type, though.\r\n\r\nThe type has a variable
    weight stroke. It might be interesting to incorporate that into the more prominent
    strokes in the mark (outer two). have the lines a little thinner than now in spots
    and a little thicker than now in others.\r\n\r\nAlso, IMHO, the latest lock-up
    has the mark too close to the type. I think there needs to be some breathing room
    between the two. "

    and rising up almost like a flame while the x-height region of the type is crouching
    around on the baseline. But really, maybe it's just me.\r\nThe bad news is I suck
    at scripts, and can't think of anything right now that I'd think might be a better
    fit. :-\\"

    It matches the stroke weight and a fun feel that the client wanted. The stems
    are not as upright as I would have liked but I still believe it is a good fit.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for all of your feedback."
