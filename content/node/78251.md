  sites, but it seems to be corrupt when I use it in Freehand, but it's ok when I
  use it in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nI love this font and can't find anything similar.\r\n\r\nIs
  anyone able to tell me if there's a way to fix this issue, or advise of another
  font I can try?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.1001freefonts.com/Renaissance.php\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help\r\nLIsa"

    of malfunction like the wrong letters coming out? \r\n\r\nLooks like a regular
    true type font. I don't use freehand anymore, but I remember Freehand would sometimes
    place fonts in odd places in the menu."
