    who does, it would be nice to have some photos of people wearing the shirts you
    designed. Also, the amount of slides and work is may be a little overwhelming
    for your professional portfolio. I would keep your strongest pieces and possibly
    combine some slides, such as the Bally business materials, instead of having separate
    slides for each design. Keep it up."
