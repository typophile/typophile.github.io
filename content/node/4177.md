    I think we might be looking at <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;topic=83&amp;page=1291"

  body: Thanks! &#40;and yes, the sample is post 1992, the font has been used by the
    record label since 1995&#41; <BR> <BR>$105 at Font Burea is way too expensive
    for me though. Would highly appreciate if anyone has suggestions for a similar
    but cheap/free font?

    and not know it. It&#39;s comes bundled with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.asp?FID=136&amp;FNAME=Placard%20Condensed&amp;FVER=1.50"
