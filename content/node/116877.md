  body: "Agree with Ryuk on the digital versions. The font was originally cut by Henry
    Schuenemann for Cleveland in about August 1890 and was sold as Euclid. Nick Curtis
    mentions the Central Typefoundry. This is also correct as Central and Cleveland
    often sold each others fonts.\r\nEuclid would be the correct name to use for all
    the digital versions.\r\nDon"

  body: "According to an article by Loy in the _Inland Printer_ April 1900 on Schuenemann,
    he worked for Central before Cleveland and while at Cleveland also cut some fonts
    for Central. Which may or may not clarify the Central vs. Cleveland origin of
    Euclid.\r\nThe fancy swash alternate capitals shown in the Dharma Type version
    are based on the original mortised alternate capitals cut by Schuenemann. They
    have also been independently digitized by Claude Pelletier as Euclid CP http://www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font?text=E+U+C+L+I+D+C+P\r\nDon"
