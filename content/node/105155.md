  body: It isn't Cyrillic at all, it just includes some very unusual Latin character
    shapes. I think it is custom lettering for a logo or book cover, and not a font.

      like it was cyrillic. I found so far Izhitsa Regular which seems to work for
      me. '

  body: "It IS Cyrillic, but it's the version that was developed for religious texts.
    Do some searches for Slavonic or old church Slavonic and you should find a fair
    number of fonts to add to Izhitsa. Not encouraged during the Soviet era but afterwards
    a popular letter-form for Russian and Ukrainian book titles, headings and advertisements.\r\nDon"
