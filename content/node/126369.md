  that "Indian Tepee" is set it. The seller estimates it is from between the 1950''s
  and the 1970''s. I suspect that it is a lost typeface, and I was hoping to find
  out exactly what it was even if it has never been digitized. My best guess is a
  bold condensed version of Lydian or a close alternative. '
