  looks as if she will phasing out the hiddenplacestudio and pushing her uncommon
  and gorgeous name. There might be graphics involved but the name will have prominence.\r\n\r\nKey
  words are, empowerement, luxury, contemporary, approachability and possibly subtly
  suggest her asian influence (specifically japanese). The artist's voice is currently
  in flux and seems to be coalescing into what you see at the following link \r\n\r\n[[http://shaylapn.blogspot.com/2007/08/painting-of-week.html]]\r\n\r\nHer
  clientele is interested in fine dining, culture, and personal growth.\r\n\r\nthank
  you kindly."

    artist. I am to set her name, Shayla in a font - possibly modified - that expresses
    empowerment, luxury, approachable, contemporary and possibly subtly suggest the
    Japanese influence found in her work.\r\n\r\nany suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    know if they have any of the qualities you are looking for but I would consider
    a simple humanist sans, Bliss or Gill (or perhaps Umbra), to contrast with the
    artworks rather than something that has similar qualities. \r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "This is the first thing drew up (last image in post) [[http://jugglingman.blogspot.com/2007/06/intime-art-opening.html]]\r\nIt
    is loosely based on letter gothic std\r\n\r\nIt was a very quick draw up, last
    minute solution to a pressing problem - ignore the horrible 'y' (I'm still a student
    with much to learn). But that was an idea.\r\n\r\nand these three are the ones
    I've tossed about.\r\n\r\n[[http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/ulysses01/UntitledImage-6.jpg]]\r\n\r\n[[http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/ulysses01/with.jpg]]\r\n\r\nsomehow
    they are too ... austere and not very memorable. I'm leaning towards letter for
    some reason.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of other wordmarks I'm sort of looking
    at that do some of what I hope to do.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.kaizensushibar.com/home.html]]\r\ntoo

  body: "I'm fairly certain that Letter gothic is anything but Asian.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I think you're aiming *way* too high -- five \"keywords\" which appear to be contradictory
    with each other to the common sense. I wouldn't even know how to unify \"empowerment\"
    with \"luxury\", or \"luxury\" with \"approachability\" -- I'd say \"luxury\"
    pretty much negates the other two.\r\n\r\nIf anyone actually pulls it off to deliver
    something that echoes all your five \"keywords\" to the majority of the audience,
    I'd call him a grandmaster of design without any hesitance."

    If I have to choose one, then empowerment is the the one.\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: "I'm not even sure what you mean by \"empowerment\". Usually it means the
    gaining of social-political influence by a group of people with a certain social-political
    agenda. But that's probably not what you mean.\r\n\r\nSo it might be better for
    you to describe what you want to achieve with more than just one word. If I don't
    know what to associate with the term \"empowerment\" even when it's spelt out
    in front of me, I certainly won't know it any better when it's \"symbolized\"
    somehow in a wordmark."

  body: "I'll use an example.\r\n\r\nWoman is stuck in an abusive relationship, never
    takes the time to get to know herself. One day she's had enough and decides I
    want to be a (insert career of choice). Having gotten that education and a satisfying
    career she wants to have the comforts never allowed to her. It's an eff u to the
    world so to speak, \"I'm allowed to be happy\". She decides to commission a piece
    of artwork to celebrate her new found freedom. She hires Shayla because  the brand
    and artwork express what she is feeling.\r\n\r\nDoes that help clarify things?\r\n\r\nI
    suppose self-empowerment is more accurate."

  body: "I've been sketching a little and brewing a lot over this.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking
    of focusing on the single most unique feature of her art, the japanese mon.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_5908.jpg]\r\n
    It is present in all of her recent pieces and sometimes encompasses the entire
    piece. She intends to make this her trademark. Nobody else does this so we figure
    it's good to insist on it and make it memorable. The shape is always the same,
    a circle within a square but the color and texture and designs/compositions vary
    so I'm locking on to the shape but it could easily incorporate color and texture.
    What say you?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shayla_wordmark_5025.jpg]"
