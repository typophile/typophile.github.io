body: "My father Karl Pausch, who died in 1984, created a typface called Kap Antiqua
  for VCG in the seventies. I remember the time when worked on it and he left me a
  copy of some of his originals. \r\nDoes someone know something about this typeface:
  Examples where it was used? Is it still in use? Are there still documents or originals
  about this typface at VGC? \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for every hint!\r\n\r\n*****************************************\r\nDr.
