body: I'm currently taking Typography Hierarchy at the Art Institute of Salt Lake
  City and was turned onto your site through my teacher. He challenged us to find
  something wonderful and at the same time irritating with type. So I remembered a
  book, The Bachman Books, to be precise that was very challenging to read because
  of the font. The book gives no indication of which font is used, but it makes the
  eyes very tired and distracted when reading. I was hoping maybe you would know which
  font it is or if it's simply a curling issue.
