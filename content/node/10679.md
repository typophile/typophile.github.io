    because his Web pages were not accessible. He wrote back that the server was renamed

    Amazon has it. I was going to include a link, but those Amazon URLs are so long

  body: If all you want is something in a similar style but free, you may find something
    you like over at <a href="http://www.nicksfonts.com/">Nick&#39;s Fonts</a>. He
    has a bunch of Deco-era kinds of faces for free, and they look pretty well-made.
