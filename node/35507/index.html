My guess is that "self evident" is code for "Seattle airport is not quite as big as JFK so things are easy to find" :-)

At least at JFK (and on the funky Dulles buses), you can see where you're going!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Seattle has a good public transit system, too. There are regular buses from the airport to downtown. Here's Google Transit's view of it:
http://www.google.com/transit?ie=UTF8&f=d&saddr=sea&daddr=1113+6th+Ave,+seattle&ttype=dep&date=7%2F31&time=1:18pm&z=11&om=1

The #194 would certainly be cheaper (@ $2 or less) than a cab or shuttle (probably $30+), and might even be easier, depending on whether you're taking a shuttle that has other dropoffs.

<div class=commentbody>The 194 is pretty speedy half an hour and cheap (maybe $2.50). Schedule is here... http://transit.metrokc.gov/tops/bus/schedules/s194_0_.html
The 4th and University stop sounds like the closest to the hotel. Head up hill a few blocks and then north to get to the hotel.
The 194 doesn't really accomodate people with lots of bags or a huge suitcase (say one full of Froggy flyers). If you have either of these you might want to sit towards the back where you can find room to stash your gear.
My guess is the gray shuttle maybe athe Grey-line bus that serves downtown airports.

<div class=commentbody><cite>Seattle has a good public transit system, too</cite>
I just about choked on my mocha. Have you ever used Seattle's public transport?
In any case, I work at a hotel downtown. Here are your options:
Metro bus: As above. You get to ride next to the hobos, and the drivers have little patience for lots of luggage.
Greyline bus: It's basically a charter bus that stops at various locations.
Misc. Shuttles: There are 2 dozen handfuls of different companies. They're all the same, and they're all mediocre.
Taxi: Screw those guys.
Towncar: My preferred method. We can arrange to have a car meet you, drive you downtown, and you won't have to put up with a lot of baloney from the driver. If you call your hotel, or preferably me since they pay commission, we can get anything from a limo to a suburban to a minivan to a towncar to ride you into town in style.
I have my preference, but the greyline/shuttle services work fine. Not very comfortable, and slower than molasses, but they'll get you there eventually and they're almost decently priced.
The towncars are fast and comfortable, and cost less than a cab because they're a flat rate, not on the meter.

<div class=commentbody>The 194 is great, as Stephen found. I've taken it a half dozen times and never had any problems - no hoboes on the airport line, just businesspeople coming into Seattle and airport employees. Yes, get off @ 4th and Madison and it's just a coupla blocks to the hotel, a nice easy walk.
I get in on Thursday evening around 8:30 and if people want to share a cab, I'll do that with 3 others, or just take the bus. See you all Thursday night.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just another FYI: talked to a concierge at the hotel, he said Grayline was very slow and overpriced, he suggested the public bus - or "otherwise (I'd) get ripped off."
Runs every 15 mins during the day, every 30 until 11:30 PM, then every 90 minutes until 6 AM.
See you all tomorrow night.

<div class=commentbody>I took the 194 along with many luggage toting passengers and a couple of vagrants in need of a shower. The ride was quick and easy. It cost me only a buck and a quarter due to off-peak fare. Si was dead on about the driver though. She was the Seattle version of the "Soup Nazi" belching out barrages of bitching attacks on those who dared stand near the back door or who's luggage eclipsed the dreaded white line. Just think, I only paid $1.25 and got to hear 20 minutes of Don Rickles in the bargain!

There and back, I didn't have the right change and people insisted on giving me exact fare and nothing in return. Nice folk.
On the way back shared the bus with a bunch of Red Sox fans.
