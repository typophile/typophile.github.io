  Machine, yet there are some things I don\u2019t really understand. I thought I might
  post those questions here and see whether more experienced users can help!\r\n\r\n<strong>1)
  Pair List workflow</strong>\r\nI created my groups and a pair list which basically
  includes all different kind of kerning (A-Z against A-Z, A-Z against punctation
  etc.) at once. Here the question whether you guys create separate pair lists which
  you import and kern subsequently? Is the pair list something you keep re-compiling
  again and again, until all kerning is done? I assume I wrongly regard the pair list
  as something fixed, a single \"master file\" which must be updated and reshaped
  according to new problems that arise during kerning. Wrong?\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Add
  and subtract from a pair list:</strong>\r\nAmong my groups O and Oslash are part
  of the same O-group, and I compiled a pair list which kerns all groups against each
  other. What are the right steps if I later on notice the need for Oslash to have
  its own treatment across all kerning?\r\nI can easily delete Oslash from my O-group
  and update (apply) my groups, but: Oslash logically does not appear as \"own instance\"
  in my previously created pair list. Is there the possibility to \"add\" new groups
  to my previously generated pair list and kern them against all already existing
  ones (basically giving the new group the same behavior like the others), without
  having to create the pair list completely new?\r\n\r\n<strong>3) The nature of the
  pair list:</strong>\r\nI generated a huge pair list but skipped some parts during
  the kerning, like kept them for later. I save my UFO-file and call it the day. The
  next time I open the UFO, the kerning-window only shows the pairs which have kerning-values
  added, the skipped ones (every combination which I left with a zero value) are not
  visible anymore. Is it correct to now simply import my pairlist.txt again, hit \"use\"
  and continue with the kerning?\r\n\r\n<strong>4) Naming of the pairs</strong>\r\nIn
  the group editor my group called \"hyphen\" contains  emdash, endash, hypen and
  also the asciitilde. However, after compiling the pairs this pair is listed as \"asciitilde\"
  in my kerning. I always get confused when going through the kerning and it reads
  \"Y kerns agains asciitilde\". Is there a way to change the name of the pair?\r\n\r\n<strong>5)
  Kerning in collaboration</strong>\r\nWhats the best way to synchronize/update data
  in case two people split the amount of work during kerning? Just as example: In
  case I start kerning from the top, and my colleague from the botton of the same
  pair list. If I would simply import his part of kerning into my .UFO file, the kerning
  I would have done until that point would be overwritten \u2013 is that correct?\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay,
  thats the troubles I\u2019m having for now. I hope I described the scenario in an
  understandable way.\r\nWould be great if someone could put some things right for
  me :-) Thank you a lot!\r\n\r\nBest wishes from Amsterdam\r\nHAN"

    terms of manpower utilization, this might make sense; however, in terms of delivering
    a product with consistent kerning, this approach does not make a lick of sense\u2026"

    Metrics Machine by Tal Leming. Till now I only worked with FontLab. So there will
    probably appear some questions. I already fail to open a simple file. So my first
    problem is how to open my FontLab data in Metrics Machine. Do I have to convert
    my font into a ufo.-file?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if someone could help!\r\ngreetings

    files. Both convert without problem, but when I open the bold-weight in Metrics
    Machine no glyphs are displayed in the main window. In the light-weight everything
    is okay.\r\nWhat could be the problem? \r\n\r\ngreetings\r\nfred"
