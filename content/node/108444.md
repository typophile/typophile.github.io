  body: "Great that you could identify it\u2014but I suspect that this is some kind
    of illegal remix/rip-off of various typefaces. Many of the capitals look a lot
    like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/gill-sans/\">Gill Sans</a>,
    whereas most lowercase letters remind me of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-kabel/\">Kabel</a>,
    so he might have drawn from different sources to make this. Wherever the letters
    came from, it seems unlikely to me that he created them from scratch and, if he
    did not, even more unlikely that he obtained the permission of the copyright owners
    of the original fonts. Beware!"
