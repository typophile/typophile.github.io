body: "Greater Albion has just released the Cherritt Family of twenty faces on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/cherritt/
  | Myfonts.com]].  Cherritt is the \u2018go anywhere\u2019 family-as the selection
  of images below shows, it can be equally at home captioning a sepia tinted vintage
  photograph, on the cover of a children\u2019s adventure book, a retro-futuristic
  design or a travel poster.  Our sample images below give some small idea of this
  great scope.\r\n\r\nWe think of Cherritt as a \u2018bullnosed\u2019 serif face,
  because of its rounded off serifs. What that phrase may not convey is the friendly,
  approachable nature of this large family of faces.\r\n\r\nThe design was originally
  inspired by traditional draftsmens\u2019 hand-drawn serif lettering, but has been
  given a precise geometric flavor that suits it for work owing its inspiration to
  any era, from Victorian times through to the modern. \r\n\r\nThey are ideal for
  headings and poster work, but also for setting small volumes of text. Four weights
  are included in the family, as well as wide, expanded and condensed forms, true
  small capitals and openface forms.\r\n\r\nAll family members embody extensive OpenType
  features.\r\n\r\nYou can try out Cherritt for yourself on Myfonts.com or see a bigger
  range of sample images at high resolution and specimens on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com
  | blog]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cherritt_Gallery1_5197.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cherritt_Gallery8_3927.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cherritt_Gallery7_4363.png]"

  body: "You're doing great work, although you wouldn't know it from the lack of enthusiasm
    shown by members here. And I like your typeset pieces. \r\n\r\nMy only criticism
    of your work in general is that sometimes a font  - or a variant of a font - can
    look a little like it has been automatically \"bolded\" - for want of the correct
    terminology - or extended or condensed and this leads to letters that can look
    bland. \r\n"
