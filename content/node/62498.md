  reference points is the style associated with Italian Art Deco Ski Posters and the
  like. The closest thing we have found to what we want is Mark Simonson's  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/|Mostra]]
  and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/|Mostra Nuova]].\r\n\r\nThese
  may be sufficient for what we need, but I'm interested in seeing alternatives. I'm
  particularly after sans serif faces that make a somewhat less overt allusion to
  this style, without imitating it quite as literally (Neutraface came to mind because
  of the low x-height). Does anyone have any suggestions for either literal 30's Art
  Deco Poster Style OR something that might imply such a style a bit more subtly?
  Thanks in advance."
