  body: "The type on this  album cover appears to be hand-drawn (I\u2019m seeing variation
    among the repeating letters).\r\n\r\nClosest match I could find in a digital typeface
    is Caviar Dreams:\r\nhttp://www.nymfont.com/2009/06/new-caviar-dreams-font.html\r\n\r\nAdd
    a crossbar to the G, roughen up the edges, and add the eye details, and it comes
    pretty close."
