  raised at work.\r\n\r\nI'm putting together some brand guidelines for a client and
  the corporate typeface I'm proposing is Lineto's TYP1451.\r\n\r\nNow my client is
  sourcing numerous design companies to produce booklets, brochures and posters. My
  question is: Does each company working on their corporate materials have to purchase
  the typeface, or is it just a case of my client buying a multi-user license and
  supplying it on demand to each design company working on it...?\r\n\r\nAny help
  \ on this issue would be greatlu appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nM"

    when clients email us the fonts and claim that they don\u2019t nneed to be paid
    for.\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026or is it just a case of my client buying a multi-user

    you\u2019re interested in that kind of license, you\u2019ll need to work out a
    deal with Lineto. Contact them directly."

  body: I would suggest you or your client contact Lineto and negotiate an enterprise
    license.  Depending on what is agreed to such a license would allow your client
    to distribute the font to all users in the company and to all vendors that are
    doing work for the company.

  body: "Furthermore....\r\n\r\nIf someone sends me an ad and states that I need to
    purchase the font, can that person give the outlined version of the font instead
    of spending hundreds of dollars on a font that I will probably never use again?"

  body: "Rican,\r\n\r\nI think the key to your question is the word probably.  Speaking
    as a designer (and not a lawyer) I'd have no problem with your client sending
    you the font for one off use on a project for them provided:\r\n\r\n1. They had
    sufficient licensing to cover the copy sent to you in addition to any others they
    might have in use.\r\n\r\n2. That you delete the font immediately the project
    is finished, and don't leave it sitting around on your system to 'probably' not
    be used - but then maybe come in useful for another project one day (say in three
    year's time) when you've forgotten all about where it came from in the first place.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I'm no lawyer and that's just my personal viewpoint, others may well feel
    differently.  In any event, the cost of purchasing a license yourself would seem
    to be an expense that can legitimately be passed on to the client.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Rican, Not many fonts cost 'hundreds of dollars'. Most are between $10-$50
    depending on the character set and versatility.\r\n\r\nRasendyll, Be careful giving
    that kind of advice (I acknowledge that you say you are 'not a lawyer') but the
    user must check the license (it may not allow off-site use) and if they have any
    queries about what they can do with the font, to check with the distributor or
    the foundry. "

  body: "So, building on this, could someone answer this question for me.\r\n\r\nI've
    known of Major Toy Companies who release a current Style Guide and throughout
    that Style Guide in various Art displayed on the pages, they will use x amount
    of fonts from various Foundries. They have bought them to display in their Style
    Guide, but the Style Guide might go out to a thousand supplier/makers on behalf
    of that Major Toy Company. At the back of the Style Guide they will have a list
    of the fonts and where to buy them.\r\n\r\nSo say, someone (an individual supplier)
    is producing large bouncing balls...\r\nHe sees that he can get a Font from that
    Style Guide by also buying from the same Foundry.\r\n\r\nBut then this Supplier
    goes ahead and produces 200,000 large bouncing balls with the Toy Company's Character/logo
    etc and the Font Designer's Font.\r\n\r\nIn a License, how does the Font Designer
    protect him or herself from this mass usage of his Font?\r\nThe supplier's Graphic
    Design Department probably bought the Font as if they were less than a Commercial
    enterprise. The balls go to another part of the world were the Font Designer never
    sees them.\r\n\r\nJust life?...or can you have a clause against mass usage of
    a Font?\r\nIs the original Major Toy Company liable?\r\n\r\nI'm new to Font Design
    and Font protection, so I'd love any feedback.\r\nCheers\r\nDrj"
