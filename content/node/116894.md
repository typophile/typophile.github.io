  of the glyphs are different. You can see the A, M, K, and S are all a bit different.
  This was not done on a computer, but probably some other kind of titling system
  in the analogue days, so a more direct match might not exist?\r\n\r\nIn the picture,
  the top (the yellow) is the original, the bottom are my approximations using Helvetica
  and Arial. Overall, the original looks thicker...\r\n\r\nI'm working on restoring
  these credits, so any help in getting this closer to the original would be, well,
  helpful. :)"

  body: The longer I'm looking at your sample, the more I'm convinced this is not
    a special font, but the thickness is the side effect of a bad quality rendering
    on a low resolution device (or bad quality image capture from a low res video
    sample).

  body: "In a case like this its worth asking whether the film-maker wanted a special
    effect for the titles or merely wanted to inform. \r\nIf the latter then you could
    examine what the film-maker and his production people would probably consider
    as appropriate font options.\r\nHelvetica would definitely have been familiar
    to a film maker in the 1990s.\r\nAs for Arial I am not certain precisely when
    it became widely known. It was designed in the 1980s for a laser printer and promoted
    as a font for IBM/Microsoft computers from the early 1990s onward.\r\nBTW your
    film may predate the use of digital fonts for film titles. \r\nIn these circumstances
    I would go with Helvetica.\r\nDon"
