    extrusion, this time of a sans L in severe perspective. The h gets off without
    any butchery for some reason. The e suffers because someone on the team likes
    Trebuchet.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s particularly irritiating for me since I loved the
    old lettering on the shop in Reading (and hankered after obtaining it one day).
    John Lewis stores often retained the name of the shop they'd taken over: for decades
    Reading's John Lewis store was called \u201CHeelas\u201D. And it was those six
    letters, in huge white caps, that were proudly outside the big store until only
    3 or 4 years ago. Central office must have got the jitters that the brand might
    not be getting through. Happily, I heard the sign was so well loved among staff
    that it now resides in the garden of one of the execs. At least it wasn't scrapped."

    to come up with an original font design, but these things, the Frutiger look-alike,
    and the Gill thing are touching the bottom. But the ironic bit is that big$$ firms
    get money for this. I am of the revival-is-good school, but the change-it-and-revive-it

    I was there, and I used to go by it often.\r\nStreamlined art-deco brick building.\r\nFirst
    time I saw the logo I thought, oh, post-modern Gill mod(ification).\r\nThat's
    what a lot of the world looks like; the new imposed on the old, rather than something
    fresh which integrates old and new themes from the ground up.\r\nThe logo connects
    past and present, conservative and modern, which is what everyone wants. Yeah
    it's ugly, but PoMo ain't about harmony.\r\nIt makes sense in that they use straight
    Gill as their corporate face.\r\nBear in mind that this is just a logo treatment,
    not a typeface.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would have been preferable for Lewis's to start
    fresh with a new logo and custom corporate font. Quite a few UK firms do that.

    helps if you are selling clothes and furniture, like John Lewis. \r\n\r\nWhat
    the article I think is saying is that slickness and polish doesn't necessarily
    help help sell. I've heard of this for example for used cars and other cut rate
    stuff. If you look too slick and pretty people think it's too expensive for them.
    You can have good design that isn't slick or pretty, but I don't know where ugly
    helps. "

  body: "RE: What exactly do you mean by Post-Modern here? That design should ignore
    aesthetics?\r\n\r\nI don't think you are bothering to read what Nick is saying
    here. He explained his idea succinctly & very well. He wasn't defending po-mo
    just describing it. You are still reacting to the design alone. \r\n\r\nPersonally
    I think equating Po-mo aesthetic with ugliness is silly. Also, I want to highlight
    one the points Nick was making indrectly. It isn't neccesary for a type face to
    be conceived with 'Po-mo' in mind for the use or design using that type to be
    Po-mo.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that it is harder to make a type face with long
    term value while satisfing a po-mo urge than it is to make one without. But those
    90's po-mo stuff did sell stuff - not becvause they were ugly ( even if they were
    perhaps ) but because they said things in a 'voice' that was exciting at the time.
    They had a purpose & the purpose was served.\r\n\r\nAll that said; I do think
    the John Lewis Logo is incredibly dubious.\r\n\r\nHere is a po-typeface that works
    quite well for it's purpose:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mutek.ca/2006/index.php?lang=en\r\n\r\nAnd
    I don't think it's ugly. Maybe it's not a face for the ages but... so what? \r\n\r\nOh
