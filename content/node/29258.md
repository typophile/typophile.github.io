  that on Thursday 30 November the Department of Typography is holding an Open Day
  for people interested in our MA programmes (there's five: three practice-based,
  two exclusively academic; see http://www.rdg.ac.uk/typography/ ). If you are interested,
  get in touch with me and I will pass on further details. \r\n\r\nAlthough there
  will be another Open Day in the spring, anybody interested in investigating funding
  support options needs to start work on applying soon."
