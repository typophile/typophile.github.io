   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">What??? Times New Roman was designed by Monotype in ca. 1930 for the Times of London. Times Roman is the Linotype version of this same face. Therefore, Times Roman cannot be the first serif typeface!

The first typeface with serifs on it would have been cut in Italy sometime after 1460. Remember, before Gutenberg invented printing in the west in ca. 1450, there were no typefaces or fonts in Europe! (In China and Korea, movable metal type seems to have been invented earlier; Gutenberg probably had no knowledge of these things, though).

Lettering and calligraphy predate typefaces by about several thousand years. But lettering or calligraphic styles are just that; they are styles, not typefaces.

So, now that we've got that straight, the first serif typefaces may have been cut by Conrad Sweynheim and Arnold Pannartz, two German printers who left Mainz for Italy, openning the first printing press there. But it is debatable whether their typefaces are really serifed. Nicholas Jenson's typefaces (ca. 1470 in Venice) are often considered the world's first serif types.

But these typefaces didn't really have names. Names became attached to typefaces later, when typefounders began marketing their fonts to other printers.

The first letters with serifs on them were probably carved into stone by the Romans. Again, these letters don't really have names either. There are sometimes refered to now as Capitalis Monumentalis, or just monumental Roman lettering. The stone-carved letters on the Trajan Column in Rome are probably the most famous examples of these.

But I have no idea what you are really asking! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although names is what last after a person or a city dies, you should know that the invention of the typophile scroll bar is as old as the papyrus roll ; this because to form the long strip that a scroll required, a number of such sheets of papyrus were united, placed so that all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll's length were on one side only. So, for your interest, one modern book you can flip the pages is "The Nymph and the Grot" by James Mosley (1999).</div>

* Do your reasons for Jensen's serifs not being serifs match any of the Jensen diamond ideas in The Stroke?

		<div class="commentbody">Though many historians attribute the development of serifs to the ancient Romans, it was in fact of Egyptian origin, particularly "slabs".

The association of the term "feet" as being synomonous with the typographic term "serif" was due to the fact that these terminals were originally depicted in hieroglyph (see below):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hieroglyph2_5694.jpg]

Frequently these "feet" were situated on a rendered baseline (especially on bird feet):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hieroglyph_birdfeet_5494.jpg]

The illustration below shows the direct correlation between bird feet and serifs used for the lowercase "i" --
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/turkey_diag_4257.jpg]

In addition to the development of formalized serifs, early hieroglyphs of birds suggest that the Egyptians invented the flared terminal and semi-sans as clearly shown below:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/turkey_sans_6337.jpg]

Which is a long about way of wishing you all a Happy Thanksgiving!

God. It's 11 PM. I was trying to relax and wind down. Then I see this. Thanks. Now I'll never get to sleep.

<cite>So here's a question:</cite>
Even though there were no "typefaces" proper, by the 15th century the alphabets were pretty much standardized, weren't they? I mean, the early puch cutters weren't really "designing" new types, they were copying standard types in use by the scribes of that era.

It's a technology thing. Would we say that typefaces were never designed before Postscript just because no one had done so yet?</div>

Jenson and Griffo based their types on existing letter forms from scribes. However, they figured out how to give the letters and words more even color than hand-written letters, and so made type more readable than hand writing. This sculpting of letters for even color was a huge advance--which we still arguably haven't improved upon significantly. Also each scribe to some extent would have their own hand--and type designer his own style. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">>but i’m still confused over lowercase serif fonts. 
>were they invented during the Capitalis Monumentalis?

You still do not seem to understand! Before Gutenberg (or whoever else might have been first, perhaps someone in China or Korea) cast his first fonts, there weren't any typefaces and there weren't any fonts. Their were many different ways to write or carve the alphabet, but none of these were types or fonts. Fonts are means of mechanically reproducing a specific design over and over again.

Lowercase letters were codified centuries after the Romans settled on the forms of what we now call uppercase letters. An argument could be made that lowercase letters first appeared before 300 AD, but a good simple answer is that they didn't arise until the early middle ages.

>i mean, was it only uppercase during that time? 

Yep. Well, only sort of. You see, since there was no "lower"case, there could not be any "upper"case, now could there? There was only one case. It looked a lot like what we call uppercase today. But even when the first "lowercase" letters were written, they weren't quite seen as an addition to uppercase letters, but rather as a totally separate style, entity, or evolution. Some scribe wrote all in "uppercase", some all in "lowercase"—but they saw the two as different independent styles. The mixing of upper and lowercase letters together would only came later, probably in the high middle ages.

>what about small caps? 

Small Caps are really a typographic invention in my opinion. That is, they weren't invented until "typography" was already around, that is, after the invention of typefaces in 1450 and thereafter. If I recall correctly, Aldus Manutius (Venice, ca. 1500) made use of small caps in his books. But I can't verify that, nor do I know if other printers before him used them or not. So, no exact date here from me!

>whst is curvise and semi cursive lettering? please explain. 
>Thanks for your time, very highly appreciated :)

This is a bit too many questions ;-)
Perhaps someone else will step in and answer this one for. But if I were you (and I was in your situation once, not all that many years ago…) I would go to your University library and read some old books about the development of the alphabet, of writing, and of printing. Then you'll know the answers to these questions inside and out.</div>

<strong>Case (Typecase)</strong>
a wooden drawer partitioned into many small boxes, used to store the separate type characters. The cases are held in a frame or rack, often with a bracket on the top to allow two cases (eg an <strong>upper</strong> and <strong>lower</strong>) to be held open one above the other, and in front of which the compositor stands whilst setting the job. Some cases have no internal partitions, and are used to store wood letter (or blocks, dingbats, etc.). Over 200 different styles of case are shown here, but there are many others.

		<div class="commentbody">let's be pragmatic about this and simple,
most will agree that the 1st serif would be after Guttenburg invented movable type. Before, it wouldn't be a rational way to create type. It was all done by hand up til then, starting with picographs on caves over 30,000 years ago, then the persian cuneforms, after the egyptians hieroglyphics at around 2500 BC. The 1st alphabet was created by the phonecians at around 1300Bc and then everyone jumped in.

Preceding the use of the 1st serif you'd see a various amount of written blackletter on manuscripts using the roman alphabet. in 1456 when guttenburg created a machine to print with movable type, he was printing blackletter at first until nicholas jenson designed the 1st serif. There is no offical name but a few popular recreations or fonts based on the 1st serif from original pages printed at the time are available from today's foundries. Ex: Adobe Jenson by robert Slimback or Centaur by Bruce Rogers and an original italic by Frederick warde.  

Obviously, there are possibiliies that someone else made a serif before Jenson or was the original designer and Jenson got credit, but   what does that have to do with dating or naming the 1st serif that we  know about so far. Nothing.</div>

I also caught picograph=pictograph on my previous spread.

I'd like to add that the 1st serif lower/uppercase by nicholas jenson was a mix of written humanistic style and also there is influence of the  roman cap from the romans. trajan is based on Roman lettering and you can see serifs. So, is the 1st serif from Roman cap lettering that does not have any lower case or is it nicholas jenson's lower case serif post Gutenburg? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm much more curious about the fact that Nicholas Jenson's serif type is derived partly from roman capital lettering pre-dating the 15th century. Does this mean the romans invented the 1st serif type? There is in fact serifs on lettering found on roman architecture.

as to your comment about earlier serif faces found in France rather than Italy, could be true but I'm sure it's very close in date and the romans are much more earlier than either your mysterious french type or Nicholas well-know serif. so the question is really about the romans and the fact that the 1st serif type used is actually from the roman empire or even greek empire. It might only be uppercase and only have certain characters from that era, but the serifs are there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">"mysterious French type" indeed, 
It may be so mysterious no people have ever seen it. Maybe they mean that Jenson was originally French.
"1st serif type used is actually from the roman empire or even greek empire"
The original question was "first serif font", the font of which implied metal type and the rest of the letterpress process, which brought out the original Jenson answer, though Tiffany and others seem to have notes, and books that state otherwise. And, while Greeks and Romans might have had templates for the drawing their serif bearing type, they didn't make fonts. 

So, maybe the Jenson answer is to the question "Who cut the first serif font that was useful and well marketed enough that it was used and/or copied quickly all over Europe and in the new world for hundreds of years." On the other hand, I'd be fascinated to find anything different, or specific documentation that Jenson was influenced by another type or type maker.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Much of what I've been able to find related to incunabula tends to support Nicholas Jenson's cutting and printing of the first known "Roman typeface" ca. 1470.

BUT -- <strong><a href="http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_30.html" target="new">this reference</a></strong> from the "Dawn of Western Printing" Incunabula site is very specific on the "first Roman type" used in 1465!

<em>Roman script is one of the two major scripts in the Roman alphabet. Roman script started and spread from Italian humanists' attempt to revive the style of handwriting used in ancient Roman inscriptions and to imitate the Carolingian style of handwriting used at the end of the 8th century. C. Sweynheym and A. Pannartz first used Roman type in 1465, and its use later spread to Germany. These Roman typefaces, however, retained a slightly Gothic flavor compared with today's Roman type. The present-day Roman type is based on the one first used by N. Jenson in 1470, which is said to be the most beautiful of all Roman typefaces.</em>

Without having the proper amount of time to formulate a well though out response, I'd like to add the question:

<ol>If the first so-called "serif" typefaces were simply mimicking what the humanists had found in early manuscripts were they really serifs?</ol>

		<div class="commentbody">Well it's printed with the characters of a metal font and it has serifs, I don't think it's relevant if the intention of the punchcutter was to mimick actual handwriting (according to Bringhurst type is idealized writing). Are Griffo italics or Gutemberg's textura not considered acual italic or textura fonts because they mimicked handwriting?

Maybe the serifs on these samples are not structured and systematic as today ones but they exist, what other name could we give to the horizontal apendices on the stroke endings of letters?

		<div class="commentbody">If the question is regarding the first Roman type produced. I believe it to be the type of Nicolas Jensen about 1470. At least that is what we were told in our printing lesson books back in the 50's. (That's 1950's!) As most know, true Roman capitals had been in existance for centuries as inscriptional work in stone.

Jenson's use of a lowercase that matched in style the caps was the first. A hint of things to come, was as has been posted here, the first shift towards a complete roman typeface. In my old lesson books these type of Sweynheim and Pannartz were classifies as a semi or half roman becuase of the flaring of the stems which gave a hint of a serif.

In this post I am not taking into consideration the terminations of textura letters, although I can certainly see why some consider these to be serifs. I am thinking the question was in regards to Romans as we know them. 

About twenty-five years ago I cut a metal version of the S&P semi-roman from drawings that I did, not referring directly to the original type. I had taken a damned good look at the type before I attempted my own drawings just to get it into my brain. The result is an 18 point type which I hand-cut and electroplated into matrix form and cast here at my foundry. I've used it no more than three or four times in the intervening years; mostly because I have found little use for a type of this archaic nature. I got a chance just in the last few months to print with it in completing my book: "Leaves From The Pie Tree".

Backs to Jenson's type: a great many feel that it has never been bested by any other roman, and all of the major typesetting machine companies and type foundries took a whack at making their versions of it.

I've enjoyed reading this thread.

It traces the development of the roman-style serif by scribes--before the invention of printing--but also says that the style we as we know it is a product of punch cutting. I don't know how accurate his account is, but it certainly worth reading if you want to understand the evolution of the serif. </div>

I'd be happy to make a scan, but believe it or not I don't have a scanner. Maybe I can get a friend to scan it for me. Meantime, P22 has a very small scanned image of one of the pages from "Leaves" in the RTF section of their site, which doesn't show much other than a fuzzy representation of the Quill type which I designed and cut for the printing of the book.

I have about a dozen copies of Leaves still unsold.

If the original poster is looking for the 1st serif font that has had the most dramatic impact after Gutenburg then it goes to Nicholas Jenson. Now as to which font available digitally today is the best-know recreation on offset press... that's another issue.</div>

Um, IIRC...

Font or Fount is related to the word 'foundry', which comes from the latin for 'pouring'. A foundry melts metal and pours it into moulds.  One complete pouring of a bowl of melted lead at a printer's foundry shop filled one size of one design of an alphabet with repeated characters in proportion to usage--hence one fount or font (pouring) of type. 

All other meanings of 'a font of type' are an extension of this original one. So yes, Jenson made punches, matrices, and poured fonts of type.  </div>

ps. While you're recovering, you might read the great story, 'The Know It All', by Somerset Maughm. It's about a very annoying guy. I kept thinking of it while typing my post, feeling guilty :) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">"The first typeface to be fully Roman is, I think, the one that the R-Printer [Adolf Rusch] was using at Strasburg by 1467 (Fig. 35). It has classical capitals of rather a rough kind and the characters of the lower case have been given serifs to match them and are widened and rounded so that their curves are consistent with those of the capitals. 

[...]

There were typefaces reproducing the Italian humanists' calligraphy before 1467. At  Subiaco, Sweynheym and Pannartz began using the first of them in 1464 or 1465."

From Harry Carter's A View of Early Typography, p.47.

When I can get some time, if anyone is at all interested, I can look at the dates on the Rusch and Mentelin books at the Newberry here in Chicago. They have several. My memory tells me that one of them is dated 1464 and uses the typeface that Carter mentions above. But both librarians and my memory can be wrong.</div>

The date I have in mind may not come from documents at the Newberry, but from D B Updike. Page 65, volume I, of <em>Printing Types</em> says: "But the font of the "R Bizarre", as it is often called, was the first roman letter used by Adolf Rusch of Ingweiden ("the R Printer"), who printed it in an edition of the <em>Rationale</em> of Durandus, at Strassburg, as early as 1464."

The image below is a detail of Figure 22 from <em>Printing Types</em>. The caption is: "First Roman Type used in Germany: Rusch, Strassburg, c. 1464". Sweynheym and Pannartz's first type follows as Fig. 24 and is dated 1465. This is, of course, not to suggest that Updike is flawless in his research.
