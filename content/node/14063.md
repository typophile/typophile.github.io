  body: "^^thanks for the info lexluthor\r\ni just looked at the dollar bill font
    and it helpeda bit but the first two fonts, woodcut and barrelhouse didnt work.
    \r\n\r\nthe sample is pretty old i guess, the book came out in 1974 and i think
    that image is from the first press run. i have a copy of the book with that in
    much bigger...anyways if thats what youre referring tpo (im a n00bie) it's pretty
    old. i know it's designed to look exactly like money though\r\nthanks again\r\nsami"

  body: that's what i figured, although there's got to be at least a real similar
    font around now because it's the money font

    to your sample, if you are handy with Illustrator you could alter it to work.
    However, your sample is not the same as that used on a dollar bill the leg of
    the R is radically different.\r\nTim"
