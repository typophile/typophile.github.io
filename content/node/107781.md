  body: "Thanks for the detailed image.\r\nThe font is R\xF6mische Antiqua, capitals
    designed by A. Anklam for Genzsch & Heyse, 1898. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20R\xF6mischeAntiquaLHS_6420.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/20R\xF6mischeAntiquaRHS_4018.jpg]\r\nNot
    digitized. On my to do list, but not in the near future.\r\nAs a loose substitute
    you could use Cheltenham, which also has the  G with a spur. R\xF6mische Antiqua
    differs from Cheltenham with its drooping bowls on D, P and R, splayed legs on
    M, the unspurred upper terminals on C, and other details.\r\nDon"
