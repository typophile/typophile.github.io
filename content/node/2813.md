    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Though it looks like a custom lettering job due
    to  <BR>the many different shapes for identical characters,  <BR>it might actualy
    be a titling face with an extensive  <BR>ligature set. Let&#39;s wait till our
    resident type archeologists  <BR>on the American mainland wake up: unfortunately  <BR>I
    don&#39;t have time to do any research right now. <BR> <BR>Why didn&#39;t they
    use the &#39;VA&#39; ligature both times?'

    Sveva AS Versal</a> seems to draw from a similar source. <BR>Note the typical
    UC &#34;N&#34; shape.

  body: 'As one of the &#39;old chaps&#39; here &#40;is 60 old enough?&#41;, my problem
    is that my books aren&#39;t old enough. I checked the Solotype collection and
    Dover books on Art Nouveau and Victorian alphabets, but didn&#39;t see anything
    as close as the one you found, Yves. Scriptorium another place where things of
    this vintage often show up, but the names are almost always changed.  Maybe Mark
    Simonson has some old type books? I think that&#39;s what&#39;s needed if you
    want to know what the real name was. '

    &#40;they guy who did Sveva AS Versal&#41; would have some insight into this.
    I&#39;ve seen him around here from time to time.

  body: For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m guessing that it&#39;s a late 19th century
    French or German face.

  body: Thanks for the suggestions so far! <BR> <BR>Yes, it&#39;s certainly a late
    19th century font, but I don&#39;t have specimen books from foundries of this
    era... I also thought of Fundicion Neufville which had lots of such display fancy
    fonts, but could not put my hands on digital samples... <BR> <BR>Sveva is amazing,
    the non swash caps are clearly very similar in mood with my sample.
