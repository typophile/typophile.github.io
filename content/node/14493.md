body: "Hello all my name is Erica i just wanted to post some thoughts of mine on here,
  im starting out in this world of type so i dont know to much but i have had alot
  of thoughts.  please feel feel to comment thats why were here :)  \r\n\r\nI have
  always been a creator of sorts and went to many different font sites to check out
  the latest designs, though it upset me i never could get the \"free\" font to download,
  i could always look at them.  i didnt really have to much use for them then because
  i didnt do that kind of creating.  but now as i have started my way into the graphic
  design world i find that right now i am using text alot and new and different fonts
  could come in handy. right now im just using the regular apple fonts that came with
  my MAC (which im falling in love with)  but i think i would like to venture outward
  and take advantage of these designer fonts.  but i have come to a question, when
  i am designing mock logos for any of my design classes are these internet fonts
  ok to use? is that a normal thing to do?  when i go to make a real logo for a company
  one day will it be ok to use one of these internet designer fonts for a company,
  or must you come up with your own? im not sure how all that works.\r\n\r\nand mostly
  it fasinates me how someone can design an entire alphabet of designer fonts that
  do not look anything like another, where do you get your ideas???\r\n\r\nas i have
  scaned through just about every forum topic on this web page i can see how far advanced
  most of the people here are, and makes me feel that there is a ton more to learn
  and that there is alot more involved with designing things that i do not see yet.
  \ the longest read was about \r\n\"hidefweb solutions\" this person had 6 pages
  of series of logos for this one company each page of design was different from the
  next but the content of each page individually were variations of the style being
  portrayed.  and the company said that non of them hit to home, they wanted a text
  based logo, not so much an image because they were expanding.  well there were some
  really good varieties of designes going on there, but to fathum that the company
  could not pick one??  hmmmmm i must be missing something.  it must be my untrained
  eyes.  what am i missing \r\n\r\nlast this one will stray off topic, have you ever
  seen the movie \"HERO\" wow good stuff well in there they explain the relationship
  of how thier ancient scrips (the writting they do with a large brush and paper)
  \ goes hand in hand with sword fighting, now how beautiful is that? i want to learn
  how to sword fight.  just check out the movie  :)\r\n\r\nnow most of you might beable
  to reference which discussions i speek of here in the forums, because yall get around,
  this place is pretty awsome, i should hope to beable to submit worthwile comments
  in the future. :) good luck everyone have a good night\r\n\r\n       \r\nERICA "

    Berthold's City font for example. Many logos are based on modified versions of
    already existing fonts and then there are many hand drawn logos too.\r\n\r\nIt
    is up to you to decide if a font face is appropriate for a work or a new lettering
    needs to be done.\r\n\r\nA dirty little secret: I made my own logo from scanned
    letters of DTL Nobel (a font I didn't wanted to buy).\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    but you've taken that bold step by joining into forum.\r\n\r\nYes... I did see
    \"Hero\" and have the DVD... and yes, I do know how to sword fight with the Chinese
    TaiChi Jian Sword as well... honest.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

  body: "Erica, welcome! Yes, it's not \"usual\" to design a complete font... But
    it's a unique challenge with special rewards, and you seem to already have an
    important ingredient: you think it's fascinating!\r\n\r\nUsing a free/cheap font
    for a logo: that's actually safer than using such fonts for text! Because you
    have a chance to look closely at the beziers and fix stuff as needed; for text
    a font has to be adequate out of the box. To be fair though, not all free/cheap
    fonts suck. And some reputable foundries even give out quality free fonts, sort
    of as bait.\r\n\r\nBTW, I've always wanted to learn swordfighting. There are different
    styles I guess; to me the stuff at the Olympics is least interesting, because
    it has neither romanticism nor spirit; I prefer what might be called \"Conan-style\",
    but most of all I would love to learn to properly use a wakizashi. The katana
    seems too... loud. I actually have a Japanese sword set (although it's stored
    half a world away now) but the most action it's seen was against a side of ham.\r\n\r\nOne
    parallel between swordfighting and making type I guess is the level of concentration
    required: putting your life on the line and making a good quality font cannot
    be done casually (even though few type designers rely on type to make a living).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the only way they can score higher points with the judges is to throw in flashy
    and overly dramatic actions... nothing that would ever be used in actual combat.\r\n\r\nConversely,
    the system I currently study is incredibly BORING to watch. Traditional Yang Family
    style Tai Chi (Taiji) is like wathcing paint peel, and the more advanced you are,
    the less movements are visible (all internal).\r\n\r\nBTW -- my niece, <a href=\"http://nusports.collegesports.com/sports/w-fenc/mtt/florendo_jessica00.html\">Jessica</a>,
    is a foil champion and is very exciting to watch. She floats like a butterfly
