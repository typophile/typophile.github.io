  body: Perhaps Google assigns less "weight" to a term when it thinks it is misspelled.
    Searching "safari font" brings back 600K results. In this case, it's actually
    finding lots of cases where the word is misspelled within the indexed pages. That
    somehow complicates the matter.

  body: If you put the terms in quotes, you will get the same results as David did
    (except now there are two results returned -- this one and the German one).

  body: "But if you put \u201CSafari font embeding\u201D in quotes, you get only one
    result: this page.\r\n\r\nIt seems David was comparing the correct spelling in
    quotes to the incorrect spelling without quotes. Not so strange things looked
    odd, then.\r\n\r\nSearching for both strings without quotes gives me 310,000 results
    for the correct spelling, and only 1,360 results for the incorrect spelling, which
    seems more reasonable."

  body: "Ois\xEDn, my quoted results were without quotes as well... Well, Google does
    some very weird stuff, I guess also your personal settings (as e.g. preferred
    language setting in your browser) will have an influence on the result as well."
