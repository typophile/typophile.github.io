    \r\n<em>After a trip to Prague in the Czech Republic, we noticed police information
    signs that were authoritative. When we got back to the UK we designed a typeface
    that reflected this 'police state' look. Use the upper case version for the best
    results., and look out, big brother  is watching.\"</em>"
