		<div class="commentbody">&gt; 22 of the 28 arabic letters have 4 variants <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And the remaining 6 only have two: they don't join on the left (leading) side no matter where they are in a word. Also: Arabic has no caps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David's example #1 probably has linguistic validity, but it might confuse some people: those two are actually different letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in example #2, the &quot;lone&quot; (more conventionally called &quot;independent&quot;) form of the letter yaa' (the first letter in &quot;yawm&quot;/day) is missing the two lower dots. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; short vowles are not written <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, that's an important distinction: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vowels are very much written. Also, short vowels are also written out in texts meant for learning to read Arabic, as well as when they're required to clear up a serious ambiguity (rare). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The feature of Arabic that you can dump part of the script when it's no longer needed* is enviable - although in the West it's usually portrayed as a negative. Another positive feature of Arabic that tends to be distorted into a negative is that it appears &quot;too small&quot; on the body, while in reality it's simple using the Cartesian space differently than Latin, in fact more efficiently in terms of readability (but not legibility). Latin is great for posters. Which makes sense when you consider that its [most relevant] origins are in large public inscriptions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Note that Arabic can do this only because it's a consonantal language - you couldn't apply the exact same system to an Indo-European language. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; in ISAREL YOU HAVE TO STUDY ENGLISH, ARABIC, FRENCH <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unless I'm mistaked, you don't really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to study French, and I'd be suprised if Arabic was really required either. In comparison, in Lebanon (where both Arabic and French are official languages), if you're Armenian, you end up with a requirement of 4 languages! That's because when it comes to English, you do practically <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to learn it pretty much anywhere!  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I'm pretty sure Chris was talking about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my<!-- raw HTML omitted --> images*, especially since you hadn't been able to show us yours when he made that remark! But it's interesting that Chris seemed too busy feeling offended to realize it was just a misunderstanding. I'm just happy there's no land at stake&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* BTW, Chris, I don't think the &quot;non-Farsi&quot; example is nice at all, it's the &quot;non-Urdu&quot; one that I find stellar. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the guiding principle in this banner seems to be that the enclosed counter of the two letters should be visually balanced. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interesting observation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; One would assume that if they had studied English, their writing would be better <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there's no definite point where you either know it or not, it's a continuum.
