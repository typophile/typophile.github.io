body: Hi everyone, how are you doing.  ive been going in circles for the past week.  i
  have been up reading articles and doing tutorials.  im always on here reading articles
  and different stuff but i freelance for different ppl here and there.  but i so
  get confused when its a family member.  my husband now is in the flooring business
  so he wants a cool logo and nice type. he is gonna sell ceramic, wood, carpet and
  tile.  so he didnt want the carpet roll basic theme.  i dont know if i get nervous
  or what, but literally i did about 10 logos and i still think they look like crap.  so
  the name is called flooring 4 you. i wanted to intertwine the letters but that didnt
  go to well either.  i can not find the perfect type and i cant link the words togather,  he
  chose the colors teracotta and green.  and im just trying to figure out where to
  go from here.  can you please critique me and give me some guidelines to let me
  go on my way so i can achieve what i need.  lol i dont know im just so lost. Ruia

    and white if possibble and then add the color in the last.\r\nLogo is like an
    unique word. It should be very simple so that people can remember.\r\n\r\nYou
    should also have a look at the logos of few existing companies who do same kind
    of business.\r\n\r\nall the best."

  body: "I think 2 and 3 have the most potential to develop although both need tweaking
    and tidying up, as Satya recommends start simply with black and white, the graduation
    which includes both colours probably won\u2019t work too well out of four colour
    where the brown meets the green will reproduce as a muddy shade. The name works
    against a \u2018cool\u2019 type treatment, but the type for 2 is not doing it
    at all for me the x-height and baseline are bouncing around too much and is much
    too tightly kerned.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: thank you so much for your feedback.  greatly appreciate it.  i am going todo
    some more examples.  i seen and looked at alot of carpet logos and they are all
    different.  some have serifs and some dont.   some are all caps and some are both
    serif and san serif.  im just confused with the whole process.  i took a typography
    class in school and it was great and even got some books on typography, but i
    guess some people just get it and people like me, need to keep on focusing.  thank
    you again

    practice and practice \u2013 everybody needs it to gan confidence, books can help
    but trying things out for yourself and asking for critiques is the good way to
    learn, try the critique forum, just remembered another <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/29413\">flooring
    company logo</a>.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You might also want to rethink if a symbol is really needed. \r\n\r\nFlooring
    For You (and perhaps not Flooring4U) is quite expressive as a name. Possibly all
    you need to do is set it in some really nice serif typeface. If you think that's
    too plain maybe you could introduce a sort of underline as a visual pun for flooring.
    \r\n\r\nThis underline could be rendered in different patterns and textures drawn
    from various flooring material. So the logo would be slightly different from one
    application to another. Could be fun!\r\n\r\nOf the existing options, 3 does seem
    to be the one with most potential. It may be an idea not to have the name within
    the diamond form. It might be quite hard to read in smaller sizes. And by the
    way why not make an 'F' out of the three words?\r\n\r\nAs Tim correctly puts it,
    the only way is to keep working at it. And again as he says, get another person's
    perspective every once in a while.\r\n\r\nGood luck!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     "
