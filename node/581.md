  body: "According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is creating the following exclusive
    typefaces in woodtype design form:\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\"Codex\" (an exact all-uppercase
    only 19th-century woodtype font in the design of Memphis Ornamental, featuring
    solid upper half with an open triangular part, open lower half with a solid triangular
    part, and a deep shadow).\r\n\u2022\t\"Dixieland\" (an exact all-uppercase only
    middleweight \"rounded slab\"-based woodtype font with western spurs)\r\n\u2022\t\"F690
    Deco\" (an exact all-uppercase only middleweight \"square slab\"-based woodtype
    font with western spurs, numbered from Festival)\r\n\u2022\t\"G832 Slab\" (an
    exact heavyweight \"art deco\"-based woodtype slab-serif font, numbered from Gryphon)\r\n\u2022\t\"H780
    Slab\" (an exact \"art deco\"-based 19th century woodtype/Tuscan-hybrid font in
    the form of ornamental with western spurs, numbered from Howdy)\r\n\u2022\t\"Portland\"
    (an exact heavyweight woodtype font in an actual mixture design based on Abilene
    and Rodeo No. 57, featuring two uppercase sets - \"larger\" for uppercase with
    western spurs, and \"smaller\" for lowercase without western spurs)\r\n\r\nThese
    font names are finally appearing on two of SoftMaker's premium-quality typeface
    collections - \"MegaFont XXL 3.0\" (for home users) and \"infiniType 4\" (for
    designers) - both of which were being released around May 27, 2014."

    and if that&#39;s the detailing, I would go for it. The &#34;C&#34; could be a
    little bit wider &#40;same goes for other round shapes&#41;. <BR>But other than
    that, I find it a solid. '

  body: ' Nice work! But to put a spanner in the works... I think the discussion about
    the irregularities is putting the cart before the horse, not least because they
    only seem apparent at 120 point or above. Personally I think the weight is wrong.
    I think you have a great idea here for a font that looks like a genuine 19th century
    Tuscan, but I think if they were making this design in those days they would have
    either made the stroke weight bolder and kept the ornamentation the same size,
    or they would have perhaps made the stroke weight slightly thinner and emphasized
    the ornamentation. I have yet to see an easy to read Tuscan, but there are beautiful
    ones, for sure.  <BR> <BR>Without going all the way and turning all the serifs
    into these ornamental &#34;claws&#34; - and possibly turning this font into something
    that has already been done 120 years ago - you might experiment more with the
    serifs and terminals. <BR> <BR>Sorry if I sound negative. Despite the criticism
    I think you are onto something very nice here. '

  body: Good comments... I agree with everything everyone said. <BR> <BR>Martin --
    yeah, a lot of tuscans seem to be very heavy... plus it would give me more surface
    area to add ornamentation to.
