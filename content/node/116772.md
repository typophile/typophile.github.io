body: Differs from the logo from that era, the sides of the planes have additional
  United on their sides in a different typeface. Saw it in an old film and am curious
  as to if anyone knows what it is. Seems like Futura, but the e and the t are cut
  differently. See attached image of the font on the airplane. Cheers![img:sites/default/files/old-images/united_3645.jpg]

    lettering created at some time between the 1940s and mid 1950s. The best candidate
    I can suggest is Twentieth Century Condensed Ultra Bold Italic \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20thCentCondUltraItalic_5117.jpg]\r\ndesigned

  body: "Hey Don, \r\nForgot about my post here. Thanks for the lead! Wanted to follow
    up. What I enjoy about the logo is the weight of the tittle on the i and the closeness
    of the space within the U (is there a term for that area?). \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBrian"

    at the reversed logo on the tail, I think the characteristics you like are a byproduct
    of reproduction. The equivalent of applying a stroke to the outline to further
    embolden the letters."

  body: Maybe the counter of the d is a circle to echo the tittle of the i, in the
    logo. Looks like the e is opened up as well, more dynamic? Thanks for the replies.
