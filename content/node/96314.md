  using on http://www.weylandindustries.com/investor. Knowing you guys, I'm sure you
  do :)\r\n\r\nIt looks like they're using some Gotham-like type, some Helvetica and
  some other typeface all on the same page. But I can't seem to find an exact match
  for example to the big '95 89 93' numbers and some of the others.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n- someone who used to be on typophile all the time but hasn't been
  on here for quite some time."
