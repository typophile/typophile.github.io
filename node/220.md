  but the other letters seem to be original. Anyone knows this one?  <BR> <BR><img

  body: I have no idea, but I think not only N, but i, l and a are not original either.
    <BR>I&#39;d guess it is some sort of highly-customized Baskerville.

  body: 'The lc &#39;a&#39; looks like Slimbach might have drawn it.  <BR>I think
    this is custom type: it is very consistent,  <BR>of high quality and the letterforms
    are quite unique. <BR> <BR>Of course, that doesn&#39;t help you one bit, does
    it Adriano? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

  body: tahnks for all the tips <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> It helped a bit. I also think it&#39;s custom type. I
    must try to find out who did the logo and contact them. It&#39;s really a very
    beautiful type sample. It would be cool if they released a font based on this
    logo. Once again, typophile is THA MAN <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
