  to be complete within the next month. One thing I've been asked by a client of mine
  is a page where they can actually log in and view progress on work being undertaken
  for them, which is easier said than done but I can definately imagine the benefits.\r\n\r\nAfter
  continual searching on Google and indeed our own forum, I've been unsuccessful in
  finding any relevant information about creating such a system.\r\n\r\nIf any of
  you know of a decent resource with a tutorial or otherwise, and can indeed gauge
  the difficulty of setting up such a service with limited coding knowledge, I'd love
  to hear from you.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nPaul"

    \r\n\r\nUsing .htaccess is very simple. You don't even have to create a login
    page, because the browser will popup a login dialog, in which you can fill out
    name and password."

  body: "This may not be quite what you're looking for. The system is in use in some
    Finnish advertising agencies. The designer post a pdf for the client to review,
    the client can then make comments to it online. The history of comments stays
    in the archives.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kommentoi.com/content.asp?lang=eng"

  body: "I'm going to look into the suggestions above. The method I have been using
    is very simple. I just create a directory for the client and email them the address
    to the file...\r\n\r\nwww.domain.com/proofs/client/filename.pdf\r\nor\r\nwww.domain.com/proofs/client/filename.jpg\r\n\r\nIt's
    not secure, but without the filename no one is going to find it. And for my work
    it wouldn't matter if they did."

  body: "There are dozens of way to handle this. The quickest is likely the htaccess
    method (if you are on an Apache server). Give each client a folder and password
    protect each folder. \r\n\r\nThe ones where a client logs in on the home page
    would be applications written in PHP or ASP.net or RoR or the like."

  body: Thanks for the advice guys, some pretty intuitive suggestions which I'll take
    under consideration. I'm thinking I'll go with the htaccess method to display
    a knowledge of extra-curricular coding (I'm currently a student and our portfolios
    are graded by lecturers on a quarterly basis) so I appreciate the insight.
