  ever created. I think I got it with my InDesign CS2.\r\n\r\nBut I had a question
  \u2026 \r\n\r\nHow condensed is \u201CMinion Pro Condensed\u201D compared to just
  plain \u201CMinion Pro.\u201D (give me a percentage) I see \u201CMinion Pro Condensed\u201D
  a lot and I think it\u2019s awesome. Plain Minion Pro is even more awesome."

  body: Why not lay out a block of, say, 10 lines of random text in each and measure
    each line with a printer's ruler (or a millimeter ruler), then compute the percentages
    from the differences in length? Kind of labor intensive, but you'd get a pretty
    accurate percentage I bet.
