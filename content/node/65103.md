  phrase: \"Warning: Improper use may cause bums\". This struck me as a rather odd
  side effect for anything to have. Even more odd was the fact that the kerning in
  'warning' (if any) seemed perfectly normal.\r\n\r\nJust thought I'd share.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    saw the headline in FF Masala. How ironic. Awesome illusion of assumption.
