  I would like to find a nice agency to work there (as graphic designer). I'm willing
  to travel a bit as well, but I'm limited to public transport. I'm not very familiar
  with the design world in Aachen or its surrounding area, but I thought one or two
  of you might be. I hope you've got some tips for me, or perhaps some places to start
  looking. Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nGreetings, Jeffrey "
