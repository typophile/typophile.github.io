<p>I&rsquo;ve been sent some fonts on a CD and some of the fonts have lost their word spaces! Apparently they were designed on a Windows machine, but the sent files were intended for the Mac. There are the post script outline files and the bitmaps, as there should be. The files themselves were not sent compressed on the CD. My Mac is running 10.4.11. Some fonts seem fine; others have lost their word spaces and so appear as an unbroken string of letters.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what has happened here?</p>

<p>My wife had something similar happen with InDesign and a job that mixed OpenType and Type 1 fonts. When they made a PDF, the spaces went away. They finally got them back, don&rsquo;t remember how.</p>
<p>I would suggest that as a start, the fonts be resent, but zipped or stuffed. Second, would be to remake the Mac fonts from the Windows format. Of course, all this assumes you&rsquo;re not violating a license; couldn&rsquo;t recommend that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">One thing your type designer friend should check for is whether the font has an &ldquo;HT&rdquo; (horizontal tab) character&ndash;it shouldn&rsquo;t. I seem to recall a problem with some Type 1 fonts that cropped up with OS X wherein, if there was an HT character in the font, OS X would use it instead of the &ldquo;space&rdquo; character in TextEdit and some other apps. It seems that Fontographer would (sometimes? always? not sure) add the HT character automatically, giving it a width of zero. Hence, it would look like the space character was missing.</div>

<p>But is it possible in Font Forge to simply delete the horizontal tab character? I suppose that would require undefining that slot. Is that possible? Clearing the slot doesn&rsquo;t do it since it is already clear.</p>
<p>As to name conflict: yes the names are really all over the place on this, but no amount of editing them is making the problem go away. And the problem is occurring where there are no condensed fonts.</p>
<p>One last bit of info: the fonts were made on Mac 8.6 and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve previously been tested on OSX.</p>
<p>A very intriguing puzzle though!</p>

<p>Maybe. I don&rsquo;t mess with Macs, so I can&rsquo;t test this. But if the presence of the HT character in the font causes the &ldquo;space&rdquo; in text file to be hex 0009, all you have done is leave a time-bomb. Consider justified copy . . . Consider an XML file made from a Word document where the &ldquo;spaces&rdquo; are really a HT . . .</p>

I had a case crop up, but now I can&rsquo;t reproduce it. So Leopard may still have a little way to go before it irons out this problem.</p>
<p>Font Forge doesn&rsquo;t have an obvious way of simply undefining a slot — not that I have been able to find — so I&rsquo;ve done the next best thing and changed the slot to .not def. Actually I suspect that just saving the outline file to OTF makes this problem go away because I think OSX.4 understands where to get the space character with open type fonts. At any rate, I have been able to get the font to work reliably now so thanks. (I&rsquo;ve even added extremal points, corrected directions, and added autohints.)</p>
<p>Nick — sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t post an image as it would have been breaking a confidence.</p>
