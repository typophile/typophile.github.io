  fire department stated he wanted the name of the firehouse \"in a font that looked
  simluar chrome\" Does anyone have any suggestions? I know the chrom effect can be
  created with third party design software, but what about the font?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTim"

    fire department logo in general?

  body: 'Did he mean actual chrome or some font called chrome (I think there is one
    called chell chrome or something like that)?  Custom lettering treatment could
    probably capture some aspects of actual chrome.  That would be independent of
    font.  Maybe you could give some more info from your brief - what are the main
    themes, ideas and messages of the brand, who is the audience, etc.  '

  body: "I was just trying to see if you guys knew a font that looked good in a chrome
    effect, not necesarily that the font looked like chrome. For example, the type
    of font I'm experimenting with is LHF Burbank. Again I'm just trying to identify
    other fonts that have an Old West / Fire Department look to them and will try
    applying a chrome filter to them to see if it works well or not.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your time.\r\nTim"

  body: "You need to gather more info from the captain, as Luma Vine suggested, but
    my guess is that he had a chrome effect something like this in mind (which you'd
    need to create in Photoshop)...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cars2_4488.jpg]\r\n\r\nMost
    fire department logos I've seen are just awful. They're designed like an old-fashioned
    city seal with tiny details that are illegible unless blown up large and examined
    carefully. \r\n\r\nbad fire department logos:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bad-logos_6221.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    guess the fact that he's interested in a chrome effect at least shows that's he
    considering something a little different. But keep in mind that a client's initial
    ideas may or may not be the best way to go. Try to find out why he likes that
    look. It may not be the chrome itself, but something else that he likes (a more
    contemporary look, or the vehicle association, or the pizazz, or whatever).\r\n"
