body: I'm trying to match this font for a dust-jacket reconstruction. I can't seem
  to locate an italic with this peculiar cupped apex on the cap A, and the flat (not
  steeply angled) lc "f". Looking through McGrew's AMERICAN METAL TYPEFACES, it is
  similar to MacFarland Italic (p. 208) but the f is wrong there. He mentions that
  it is known as "Classic" on Linotype, but my Linotype catalog (1939) is missing
  that section even though it is mentioned in the contents. If someone has that section
  and can check it out for me and contact me, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks very
  much.

  body: Okay, with no answers here, so far, I've managed to identify it myself. It
    is an old Linotype face called "Classic." An Old Style face that seems to have
    been removed from later editions of the Linotype Specimens book. I managed to
    find a PDF of an earlier catalog that has a full set of the roman and italic.
    Thanks anyway.
