    nicer. My Latitude from 6 years ago was an austere\r\ndark gray warrior. The good
    news: I'm not going on any catwalks\r\nwith my laptop. Or even without it, come
    to think of it. But with\r\nthe $1000 I saved, I could afford a supermodel, for
    like 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the fan that is a bit loud. The OS is better than that toy they call OS-X and

    at that size (and that price) you really should\r\nbe getting WUXGA. And really,
