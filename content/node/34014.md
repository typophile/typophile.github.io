  body: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Isonorm">Isonorm</a> with a modulated
    stroke, eh? It's interesting in some of the letters, but you may want to vary
    a bit more from your inspiration where it doesn't work well, especially the 'm'.

    of your design...your \"v\" strokes shouldn't be the same width.\r\n\r\nTo me
    I'd need to see more glyphs before I can really judge or critique this design.
    Like some capital letters and numbers perhaps?  "

  body: "The concept of Escuadra seems very good to me, but I find problems in some
    letters. The \"m\" might be slightly narrower and its middle stroke should be
    straight so that it doesn't pull to the left. I find problems vith the \"v\" also,
    since there should be some contrast but there's not any.\r\n\r\nThe general proportions
    are ok but I'd try not to force the curves so much. The grid still seems too evident
    to me."

  body: "I see the dot of the \"i\" as a distraction -- awfully heavy, doesn't seem
    to line up with anything (other than it's own stroke). Perhaps it should be as
    thin as the horizontal strokes? \r\n\r\nThe counter of the \"e\" also seems a
    bit heavy... with such a large x-heght, all the other letters are high-waisted
    (pants pulled up around their chests), but the \"e\" goes in the opposite direction
    with a low crossbar.\r\n\r\nVery nice, though... reminds me a little of Radiant,
    which I worked on (a version of) many years ago. You might check it out (the light
    weights) for inspiration.\r\n\r\n"

    en el mundo del dise\xF1o de letras! Admiro tu constancia y lamento no tener yo
    mismo algo de ella. Te felicito, una vez m\xE1s.\r\n\r\nTe digo mi humilde opini\xF3n
    acerca de lo que veo:\r\n\r\n- No queda mucho de la esencia de las letras en las
    que te bas\xE1s (si es que ellas son, como creo, las grisadas de la parte superior
    de la imagen). Como si Escuadra no surgiera de donde en verdad surge. La forma
    de los caracteres que est\xE1s trabajando no guardan demasiada relaci\xF3n con
    sus \"ancestros\". Esto no es una cr\xEDtica, s\xF3lo que me llam\xF3 la atenci\xF3n
    que en tu dibujo se pierda parte del esp\xEDritu que los gener\xF3 (caracteres
    usados por los arquitectos cuando no se hab\xEDa inventado la computadora).\r\n-
    Veo un interletrado muy estrecho.\r\n- Acuerdo con biddy, quien te dice que la
    'm' no est\xE1 funcionando correctamente.\r\n- Las ascendentes quiz\xE1 sean demasiado
    cortas, no lo s\xE9.\r\n- La 'f' quiz\xE1 deber\xEDa tener un ascendente menos
    \"geom\xE9trico\" y m\xE1s ajustado \xF3pticamente.\r\n- Relacionado con lo anterior:
    pareciera que la fuente pide ajustes \xF3pticos. Algunas modulaciones se me aparecen
    extra\xF1as a los ojos: como si el trazo fino se destacara m\xE1s de la cuenta
    y hubiera que atenuar esa diferencia. No s\xE9 si me explico bien...\r\n- La ISONORM
    es una buen ejemplo para estudiar, creo que vale el comentario de Stephen Coles.
    (El punto de la 'i' quiz\xE1 encuentre soluci\xF3n a partir de ver c\xF3mo se
    resuelve en esa fuente)\r\n\r\nPor ahora no veo mucho m\xE1s. \r\n\xA1Espero haberte
    ayudado y que nos tengas al tanto de los avances!\r\n\r\nAbrazo desde Argentina,\r\n\r\nelsebra\r\nwww.elsebra.com.ar\r\n\r\n/
    / / / / / / / /\r\n\r\nHello Carlos! \r\nFacing into the world of the letterdesign
    once again! \r\nI certainly admire you and I'm sorry that I have not something
    of your perseverance. I congratulate you, once again!\r\n\r\nHere's my humble
    opinion about what I see: \r\n- Escuadra isn't left to much of the essence of
    the letters in which you actually based your work (if it is that they are, as
    I believe, the grey ones of the superior part of the image). As if Escuadra didn't
    come from where it really comes. The character forms that you are working doesn't
    show too much relation to their \"ancestors\". This is not a critic, only that
    called my attention that your drawing loses part of the spirit who generated them
    (characters used by the architects when the computer had not invented yet, as
    you say). \r\n- I see a very narrow kerning. \r\n- I agree with biddy, that says
    to you that 'm' isn't working correctly. \r\n- Perhaps the ascendants are too
    short, I don't know... \r\n- Perhaps 'f' must have an ascendant less \"geometric\"
    and more optically adjusted. \r\n- Related to the previous thing: it seemed that
    the font requests optical adjustments. Some modulations appear strange to my eyes:
    as if the fine outline stood out more of the account and was necessary to attenuate
    that difference. I do not know if I explain myself well... \r\n- ISONORM is a
    good example to study, I believe that it is worth the commentary of Stephen Coles.
    perhaps (maybe dot of 'i' finds a solution from seeing how it is solved in that
    font) \r\n\r\nI don't see much more. \r\nI wish I helped.\r\n\r\nWaiting to see
    the advances, \r\nbest regards from Argentina, \r\n\r\nelsebra\r\nwww.elsebra.com.ar"

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nStephen, \r\nThanks a lot for the isonorm link. I didn\u2019t
    know that font exists. The research I been doing until now has been limited to
    the information in this industrial labeling guide: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rotulacionindustrial_3732.gif]\r\n---\r\n\r\nBiddy,
    \r\nI agreed with you, the \u201Cm\u201D needs more work. \r\n\r\nC\xE9sar, \r\nYou
    are right; the \u201Cv\u201D is extremely heavy. \r\n\r\nScott, \r\nYour comments
    about the \u201Ci\u201D and \u201Ce\u201D made me reconsider several issues about
    them. Your comment about the x height made me reconsider as well. \r\n\r\nElsebra,
    \r\nYou are right. The original idea was getting lost. Although what I want to
    do is to interpret that original idea in a different way. I wish to redesign each
    letter but not making an exact copy of the industrial labeling. \r\n\r\nI agree
    as well with your comments regarding: letter spacing, ascending height and \u201Cf\u201D
    ascendant to be less geometric. \r\n\r\nSubsequently you can find new corrections:
    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/escuadra_cfcg_6junio07_6660.gif]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI

    you may have\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nCarlos Fabi\xE1n Camargo G."

  body: "Is the slight contrast fully intentional? In my opinion, the industrial look
    you want could be achieved more easily if the strokes seemed monolinear. The \"h\"
    and the \"b\" are too wide for my taste. The \"v\" is still out of the concept,
    but its low contrast is consistent with the industrial look you're after. The
    lower stroke of the \"e\" is too short. The \"m\" is too complex in comparison
    with the other letters.\r\n\r\n\xBFEs intencional el contraste? En mi opini\xF3n,
    el \"look\" industrial que busca podr\xEDa conseguirse m\xE1s facilmente si los

    muy anchas. La \"v\" sigue vi\xE9ndose fuera del concepto, pero su ausencia de

  body: "The second version of your font is a great improvement toward usability.
    I can see commercial use for this family.\r\n\r\nMy opinions and suggestions:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
    \"h\" is definitely too wide. You also presented two different \"u\"s. The first
    one (after \"b\") is wider than the second one (after \"g\"). Use the second one
    (width and style are correct) and also adjust \"h\" to the same width.\r\n<li>You
    will have to adjust \"b\" but maybe not as much as \"h\"\r\n<li>\"m\" works better
    but still needs some work. Try making the first curve less round.\r\n<li>You will
    have to change the \"g\" to be more like the rest (\"b\" and \"h\" may be a starting
    point). You will probably change the lower part of the bowl to go upwards like
    with \"a\".\r\n<li>\"r\" is beautiful. I like it VERY much. Pointing a little
    bit down.\r\n<li>\"f\" probably needs some work on the top.\r\n<li>Letter \"t\"
    doesn't really look like it's part of the same family.\r\n<li>The right stem of
    the \"v\" could be slightly curvy. Try that to make it more family like.\r\n<li>\"o\"
    is a bit too light compared to the others especially to the neighbouring \"n\".
    So is \"s\".\r\n<li>Try a round dot on the \"i\" or \"rounded\" dot.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThis
    looks like a really promising font. I like it very much. You're getting there.
    Keep up the GREAT work."

  body: "This ultra light version is very interesting. The second version with the
    modified \u201Cm\u201D was starting to remind me of Etelka a bit. Now in the ultra
    light I see its own character emerging more. Look at the caps and consolidate
    the vocabulary of curves in the \u201CG\u201D, \u201CB\u201D, and consider extending
    the foot of the \u201CR\u201D slightly. The \u201Ca\u201D and \u201Ce\u201D look
    very solid to me."
