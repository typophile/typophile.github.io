body: Okay, so i hate when people post type IDs withought images, but i forgot to
  sneak my digicam into the theater... so for any other typophiles who watched <em>The
  Illusionist</em>, what are the types used in the opening titles, particularly the
  swash caps in the opening titles.... they were simply gorgeous!

  body: well it's not trajan, that's all over the website, and it's not whatever font
    used in the trailer titles. perhaps it was custom lettering? the titles seemed
    to emulate old-time movie titles, so perhaps they had something special done just
    as they would have done in those days... i guess i'll hafta wait and see if mark
    simonson is going to see this one. :P

    at <a href="http://www.picagency.com">www.picagency.com</a>. not much there (a
    brief glimpse of "The Illusionist" can be seen in their reel), but maybe they
    can let you know if you ask nicely.

    is a movie that suffers from lack of organization and too much experimentation.
    It's like watching 7 movies at once... The Cheesy Teen story, The romance, the
    slasher flick, the mystery thriller, The coming of age with plot twist, a low-standards
    comedy and the art house indie flick. And when you try to cram that much into
    a movie without any sort of control or organization you're going to get a mess
    of a movie. \r\n\r\nAnother sucky movie that I watched recently was the remake
    of Wickerman... don't ever see this movie, ever! It's complete drivel and Nick
    Cage must have had a lobotomy right before he signed to do it. \r\n\r\nOne movie
