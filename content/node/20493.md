body: "I'm looking for a suitable sans and small caps faces to use with Gentium, since
  this beautiful (and free!) font comes with neither.\r\n\r\nLucida Sans seems to
  be a good match, but it lacks caps and old-style numerals. Still suitable, though.
  I have no clue about which small caps face to use. I was thinking Apolline by Porchez,
  but I'd rather get some informed opinions before laying out the cash.\r\n\r\nGentium
  is here: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium\r\n\r\n "

    Milo</a> is a pretty good alternative to Lucida Sans.

    them back into the effort. It would be wrong to mix the use of the font with obviously
    capitalisitc efforts ;-) \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
