    night by the beach thunder in a north region of Quebec.\r\nIt is a slang word.
    It is not a big ''BANG''. It is more a thunder with\r\nlittle noise that create
    a lot of light in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    it should be in the critique section, and you only need to start one thread. :)\r\n\r\nthat

    Bottom horizontal stroke on the C seems too short.\r\n\r\n\u2022 stress on the
    O is completely different than the C and Q above. Not sure that you\r\nneed the
    angled stress on the O.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Cirque colors light compared to Eloize,
    not sure if that's your intention. Cirque feels like it's too small.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    kerning needs some work. Compare the E-L combo, for example, to the O-I.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    the Z-E seems like it would work better if the Z was longer and extended further
    right, which would also help narrow the large gap. \r\n\r\n\u2022 The tail on
    the Q ... maybe it should mimic the Z?\r\n\r\nbest of luck eric.\r\n"

  body: "The Z does not conform to the feel of the other characters. It has a sweeping
    swash tail as opposed to a straight line terminating in a curve.\r\nIf you're
    going to take the Z away from the style of the other letterforms, you could explore
    playing with the Z so it is perhaps more illustrative - suggestive of a bolt of
    lightning or something similar (which will tie in with your Eloize theme). It
    needs some thought and sensitivity though.\r\n\r\nBJ harvey makes a good observation
    with the C, Q and O not being the same. Id choose one or the other and stick to
    it.\r\n\r\n/Dimi\r\n\r\n:::::::::::::::::::::\r\nWicked Design Potions"
