body: I've started working between my office and home computer half and half lately
  and need to keep my fonts consistent between both. Is there any way to keep them
  both in sync and also any recommended programmes to keep them organised?

  body: "Extensis Suitcase version 12 (\u201CFusion\u201D) has worked at my office
    since about 2007. It takes some configuring and some getting used to, but once
    that\u2019s through it\u2019s fantastic. Each of our computers is usually working
    on several projects at once, so we need quick activation and deactivation of font
    sets.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce conflicts, uninstall or remove as many system
    fonts as you can; you can activate them as you need them through Suitcase.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d
    recommend <em>against</em> Linotype Font Explorer \u2014 every computer that I\u2019ve
    seen it installed on has been riddled with conflicts and phantom fonts. Usually
    the system font software is better.\r\n\r\nAs for keeping your computers in sync
    and organized, for me that\u2019s more of a personal choice. Any method of transferring
    files should work, right?"

  body: If the computers can connect with each other, some form of 'rsync' may work.
    If not, a USB stick and a file system browser/explorer might help.

    know how the server version compares, but I would certainly recommend FEX"

  body: "@pica pusher  - Thanks, going to check that out, I remember seeing it ages
    ago but never tried out.\r\n\r\n@T\xE9 Rowan  & @Jens Kutilek  - I think I'll
    go with Dropbox, my internet is terrible at home so uploading from there will
    be a pain but once the whole library is initially synced I guess it won't be much
    trouble after.\r\n\r\n@Queneau - Can you link me to that please, can't see anything
    on Google for it."
