  body: ' Hey Chuck. Nice to see another Utahn here. <BR>We are dominant on Typophile.
    <BR> <BR>I imagine you plucked this sample from one <BR>of Mr. Young&#39;s fine
    books. It&#39;s my <BR>understanding that these are his own designs <BR>and I
    know of no distributor for his work. <BR> <BR>It sure is lovely. I&#39;ll reply
    later with <BR>similar scripts, though I doubt anything <BR>can match it. <BR>
