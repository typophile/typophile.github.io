body: I&#39;m not sure how it happened, but all of the sudden I&#39;ve become an enthralled,
  obsessed, captive audience to the concept of small-scale pixel fonts &#40;I mean
  stuff for smaller devices, cell phones and the like&#41;. <BR> <BR>I know next to
  nothing about the theory of designing these fonts, and have a lot of questions about
  it all &#40;like, what is the standard grid dimension--12x12, right?&#41;.  Regardless
  of the size, I know there are obvious limitations, anyone can see that with a limited
  number of pixels to work with, eventually every possibility will be exhausted.  I
  don&#39;t know what the total number of possibilities is if you take into account
  every possible permutation of the grid, but I do know that the number of possibilities
  when specifically carving letterforms from the grid is significantly lessened &#40;for
  example, let&#39;s say you design the letter &#39;H&#39; in the grid consisting
  of 23 pixels [9 per each stem, 5 for the crossbar], that&#39;s one possibility;
  but we&#39;re not going to consider it another [real] possibility if that same design
  is taken and a pixel is added to each of the four extreme corners--this demonstrates
  the constraints&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, you can only do so much, because it will [eventually]
  all be designed.  But, what are the possibilities if we stop seeing the design of
  these fonts on a microcosmic scale, and start looking at the bigger picture, i.e.,
  a massive grid, each letterform design acting as a &#34;pixel&#34; in the grid of
  the font as a whole.  So, in other words, at some point in the future &#40;let&#39;s
  say in the year 2525&#41; when all the possibilities for each letterform have been
  set, my clone &#40;which was born some time around 2497&#41; takes a font designed
  by Joe Gillespie&#39;s clone and say&#39;s &#34;Hey, I like all of these glyphs,
  except I don&#39;t think that the &#39;c&#39; fits into this set, better would be
  to include the &#39;c&#39; from &#34;pixelfont XT37JM2323&#34;--it&#39;s a totally
  different font then, right?

    take a while. There are 22,300,745,198,530,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
    possible combinations of black and white pixels in a 12x12 grid &#40;2 to the
    power of 144&#41;. Admittedly, not all of these combinations are useful &#40;relatively
    few even&#41;, but it does illustrate that there is plenty of room for variation,
    even in a relatively small area. <BR> <BR>Remember, too, that there are hundreds
    of characters in each font and some characters offer more room for variation than
    others &#40;e.g., lowercase g vs. a period&#41;.

  body: By the way, that number with all the zeros isn&#39;t totally accurate after
    the 6. It looks like 2^144 goes beyond the level of accuracy Excel can handle.
    The number should be 22,300,745,198,530,623,141,535,718,272,648,361,505,980,416.

    </i> <BR> <BR>Well, for a 12 x 12 grid with 16 levels of gray, that would be 247,330,401,473,104,534,060,502,521,019,647,190,035,131,349,101,211,839,914,063,056,092,897,225,106,531,867,170,316,401,061,243,044,989,597,671,426,016,139,339,351,365,034,306,751,209,967,546,155,101,893,167,916,606,772,148,699,136
    combinations. <BR> <BR>If you step that up to 256 levels of gray you get 61,172,327,492,847,069,472,032,393,719,205,726,809,135,813,743,440,799,050,195,397,570,919,697,796,091,958,321,786,863,938,157,971,792,315,844,506,873,509,046,544,459,008,355,036,150,650,333,616,890,210,625,686,064,472,971,480,622,053,109,783,197,015,954,399,612,052,812,141,827,922,088,117,778,074,833,698,589,048,132,156,300,022,844,899,841,969,874,763,871,624,802,603,515,651,998,113,045,708,569,927,237,462,546,233,168,834,543,264,678,118,409,417,047,146,496

    getting far ahead of myself, but, let me be humble and admit that I know absolutely
    nothing about grayscale bitmaps and ask you--will you elaborate further on the
    process?  Please. <BR> <BR>And I think you&#39;re right, I think it&#39;s the

    pixelfont places a block &#40;as an outline&#41; where the &#34;virtual pixel&#34;
    is for a given PPEM size, a grayscale pixelfont fills that block only partially,
    to get a <i>shade</i> when it&#39;s rendered. However, the tricky part is getting
    consistent rendering accross platforms and apps, since for example Photoshop and
    Flash interpret the degree and type of filling differently... <BR> <BR>hhp'
