  taken on quite a few logo projects (in the past I had designed the odd logo here
  and there but nothing at a vector, point ot point level).\r\n\r\nI soon discovered
  that designing high quality stuff at this level, the logo design process as opposed
  to doing some basic type setting or creating at a pixel level is quite a time consuming
  and involved process.\r\n\r\nI see a lot of people still offering logo design for
  $200, obviously the quality and choices probably are not there but I guess a lot
  of people are happy to pay a small amount for their identity.\r\n\r\nKnowing the
  cost of some font families are more expensive than what some people can even design
  a total logo for how do others go about explaining to prospective clients expecting
  to design a unique and high quality logo for $200 just really isn't possible?\r\n\r\nAny
  help discussion or advice would be great.\r\n\r\n"

    difficult to explain the cost of original and expensive fonts.\r\nI am in India
    and paying for a logo here depends on the professionalism of the client. Some
    pay, some argue, some do it themselves and then ask it to be used in stuff like
    websites, brochures, ads, etal !\r\nCheers,\r\nMilind"

  body: "Communication is key. If the client won't discuss these things, and if they
    disagree with you, you should have the means necessary in your contract to terminate
    the business relationship. If you don't have that in your contract, write this
    one up as a \"life lesson\" and get it inserted! Basically tell them you got better
    things to do with your time then waste it on a $5 an hour (or insert whatever
    low currency amount) logo job. But do it nicely at first because hopefully you'll
    get them to see that yes, logo design takes time and things of quality are worth
    the effort and thus cost. Again, it's a communication issue.\r\n\r\nBut let's
    say their budget won't cover more then $200.00 at first. Well write up a different
    contract where they can pay the $200 and then 10 a month until they meet the costs
    of your time (make sure that they have a viable business to make this worthwhile).
    Or spend 4 hours (or whatever small allotment of time you can justify) and whip
    them up something worth $200.00, use a standard font and tell them to come back
    when they want to \"improve it.\" Or send them elsewhere and invite them to come
    back when they need future improvements and their budget allows it. \r\n\r\nInstead
    of thinking you have limited options, realize that you can help drive this issue
    to a great conclusion for both you and the client.\r\n"

  body: "The business of graphic design is finding and servicing the clientelle that
    is prepared to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to get your foot in the door
    with a perfunctory loss-leader, and then educate the client?\r\nIf you are working
    freelance in an ongoing relationship with a design firm, maybe sometimes, in the
    situation where the value added by spending more on production takes things to
    the next level, enabling the design firm to land a client that is prepared to
    spend more on creative. But that is not the usual or best practice, which is why
    design firms and agencies do speculative pitches to those companies that do pay
    big bucks for creative (or media).\r\n\r\nAnother model is for a start-up design
    firm to work with a start-up client, and hope for success that will see revenues
    swell for both parties: but you have to have enough social parity that the client
    won't expect to reap all the benefits while you continue in the original intern
    mode.\r\n\r\nThe principle to be emphasized is that the value added by spending
    large on creative will more than pay for itself. It can be marked up (by the design
    firm/agency, as part of its fee), will enable the design firm to play in a higher
    league, and will result in increased market share/sales for the client."

    sitting on the surface; and that not all designers (especially not the ones who
    work cheaply/rushingly) can see and handle these \"depths\". If the client is
    the type to believe that things have depth, it's not too hard; but for clients
    that can only pay attention to ripples on the water, it's a waste of time.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    If you have to explain it verbally... then the design itself isn't doing the job.\r\n\r\nAnd
    of course, if you do a $1000 logo for $200, you just lost $800.\r\n\r\nAnd as
    hrant mentioned, some people have no comprehension of design whatsoever."
