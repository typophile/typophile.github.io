  books are in some box and I can't locate it...most probably underneath a huge stack
  of heavy boxes.\r\n\r\nI remember this as Avant Garde but the M and V looks different.\r\nCan
  someone kindly let me know, I need to use it today.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCalvin\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nice_5364.png]"
