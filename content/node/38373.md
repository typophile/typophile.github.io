  body: Thanks for pointing this out, Ricardo. I was always disappointed that I never
    got to see his book <em>Words at Play</em>, so I'm eager to take a look at this
    one.

  body: Reed, I believe that you can order <em>Words At Play</em> from <a href="http://www.wordsatplay.com/getbook.html">this
    page</a>. I can't be sure if they still have copies, but do give it a try.  :-)

  body: I was under the impression that they had sold out, but having never seen the
    actual ordering page, I'm giving it a try. Maybe in "2 to 3 weeks" I'll have a
    copy of my own! Thanks again.
