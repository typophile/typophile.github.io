  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Would it be too presumptuous to ask for a moratorium on editing your posts until that feature is fixed? You see, when you edit your post it changes the time stamp causing the flow of the conversation to change quite a bit as well. I mean, a quick edit seconds after your initial post is one thing, but going back even 5 minutes later can cause a break in conversation and confusion for those who read the posts later.

Thank you for considering the proposal.

I've posted this in the GENERAL DISCUSSIONS area instead of my BLOG because I know some of you do not use the tracker to follow Typophile.</div>

And that's rather problematic when dealing with a turgid server that adjusts posting order based on time, particularly for the competitive Type IDers.

I agree completely, I'd be very happy to go back to the previous version too. I know I'm not alone in saying that. Even without the IM feature, there's been a lot of behind the scenes grumbling.

A quote (anonymous) from another typophile: 
"it's not as much fun anymore. and i don't know why, exactly. i didn't use the IM all that much. i didn't even use the search extensively -- just when i was researching a particular topic.  but still, it just FEELS different."</div>

My experience is like this: I used to have a tab with Typophile's site open all the time. Now I just close it when I get so ... you know what... And since I'm also a developer I know this is really bad. <strong>REALLY BAD</strong>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I always thought Typophile had a bit of a lag to it, even the previous version. I would usually sign in, go to my account and check my contributed topics (this had the longest loading times) before going back to the front page to see what's new and hot.

I still do this, but now I don't really feel like checking out the news/hot topics as much. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something overwhelming about that front page. The Flash seems intrusive compared to the previous version; which was just slightly intrusive. The animated logo is annoying (and if you go to any other page, it looks like a ? not a T), the topic headers are too bold and appear slightly blurry (I'm on a Windows machine with Cleartype turned on), not to mention the issue with the editing comments. 

I do like some of the changes though. I like the expanding comment box, the ticker on the front that lists the latest comments, the user icons at the bottom, the multiple page link in the original post, and the fact that the links at the very top are all available.

I've been waiting for an update to this site for a while, and I'm glad it's finally arrived, I just think it might have been too much all at once. It's upset the natural order of things and the adjustments are a bit of a shock. Changes is good, I applaud the efforts. I just think it might have been to much in too little without a proper feedback period.

		<div class="commentbody">Well not to hammer the point home, but (to me) the improvements are not immediately obvious, not that significant, and way counterbalanced by the features lost and the slowness/bugginess.

I realize the wiki improvements are important to a lot of people but as someone who mainly frequents the forums, I'd happily give up the icon parade and the expanding comment box to have a more user-friendly site back.

I also NEVER go to the home page (I bookmark the Type ID forum), and don't like flash in general so that's all lost on me.</div>

The people who work behind the scenes on Typophile, contribute their spare, unbillable time, mostly in the wee hours of the night and early morning before office hours. Because of this, we aren't able to make changes as quickly as we'd like -- this upgrade is still a work in progress, so thanks for your patience.
