  body: "It depends on what one considers a rip-off vs. legitimate revivals. While
    Phil Martin designed Polonaise as photo lettering in the early 1970's , there
    is a Type Revivals digitization named Chopin Script TR with an internal creation
    date of 1992. The earliest digitization named Polonaise I can find is URW's from
    1999.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, Claude Pelletier's Chopin Script (1999?) is based on the original
    printed design.\r\n\r\nI know that the 1992 date is accurate, because Soft Horizons/Vertisoft
    cloned the TR version as ChaseCallas in 1993.\r\n\r\nIf it's Phil Martin that
    was ripped off, who's to say that the digitized Polonaise is any less a rip-off
    than Chopin? Unless somebody KNOWS whether he gave permission, sold rights, or
    has an interest in any of these.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "Even if some letters differ, Chopin Script is considered by many people here
    as a rip-off of Polonaise by Phil Martin. See [[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=site%3Atypophile.com%2Fnode+polonaise+chopin|here]]
    for previous discussions on this topic.\r\n\r\nEDIT: text edited after Herb's
    post. Was \"Chopin Script is a well-known rip-off of Polonaise\". Thanks Herb
    for the precision, was too hasty to conclude."
