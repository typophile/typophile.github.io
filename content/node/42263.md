  Basel this summer. Because I\u2019ll only be six weeks out of school and am definitely
  going to Type Con as well, going to Basel will all go right onto my Visa card, and
  I don\u2019t want to do it unless I know it\u2019s worth the cost of a trip to Switzerland.
  If anyone out there has studied under Mr. Stamm and cares to let me know what it
  was like, please drop me an email: james.puckett@gmail.com"
