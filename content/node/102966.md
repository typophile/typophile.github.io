    Sorry for the overstatement. Letters are identical but scaled. May be they started
    from a hand-drawn alphabet or a [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/vectors/handset-type|handset
    type]], built the sentence and scaled some glyphs to increase the handwritten
    feeling... Whatever it is, I don't know such a type. What's the sample origin?"
