  question if it sounds very naive. \r\n\r\nI work for a large international charity,
  with offices and projects in about 80 countries. \r\n\r\nAlthough our name and brand
  is well known, and we have an agreed colour and font for our logo, we have never
  given much thought to having a coherent style for publications beyond the logo.
  Consequently, the publications we produce in different countries look very different
  in terms of colours, lay-out and font. \r\n\r\nIn order to save money and create
  coherence, we want to start looking into whether it's possible to create a global
  style guide that could be used everywhere we work. But there have been many questions
  already about whether it is possible to find fonts that are appropriate for use
  around the world. Some feel that fonts are so culturally specific that it would
  be impossible for us to find something that appeals everywhere. \r\n\r\nThere must
  already be reams of research into this, since it must be a problem faced by every
  organisation working across borders. If anyone could direct me to useful information
  on this question, I would be most grateful. \r\n\r\nLucy "

    each country licenses a couple of culturaly appropriate fonts, 80 x $100 = $8,000.
    How much would a global style guide and organization-wide font license cost? Would
    you save enough money to make this worth while? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some good, some ugly. That's the problem. \r\n\r\nIs $100 a fairly average
    cost? I didn't know. Guess we figure that if we have shared fonts we can also
    save money on design and layout costs. E.g. if the UK and South African office
    both want broadly the same publication, but with slightly different text on one
    page, we could create a template which both could use, rather than create both
    from scratch. \r\n\r\nGuess I am also really interested in finding out if fonts
    really are culturally specific?\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "I was guessing 3 or 4 fonts at $25 to $35 each for a five user license. Of
    course they may need more fonts, or less, supplementing system fonts and free
    stuff. It's hard to know for sure, but perhaps understanding the costs and setting
    a per country font budget might be a good start.  \r\n\r\nBut it sounds as if
    this is less about money and more about coherence. On that front the answer is
    probably \"it depends\" mostly on the trade-off between in-country perception,
    and the need/desire to have a global brand. \r\n"

  body: "I would say you have two choices, other than the present ad hoc anarcho-collectivism,
    which is not really tenable, if for no other reason than the fact that people
    travel, and it weakens your brand to be all over the place, all over the place.\r\n\r\nFirstly,
    pick a \"free\" corporate typeface that has a lot of international language support,
    such as Gentium, and standardize on that.\r\n\r\nSecondly, implement a corporate
    standard that specifies type genre, rather than dictating specific typefaces.
    That can still be quite specific about typographic style, eg. font weight, size,
    x-height and leading, and whether the typeface is humanist sans, geometric sans,
    oldstyle serif or modern serif."

  body: "I work internationally with many charities and my job is communications,
    so I've been interested to look through the branding guidelines of a couple of
    the major INGOs, and several  international companies too. Without exception they
    specify that for consistency certain fonts must be licensed, what Pantone colours
    are required and what page layouts are acceptable.\r\n\r\nIn my experience it's
    generally the head office that licences the fonts and makes an effort to keep
    everything consistent. People on the ground have different concerns than sticking
    to brand guidelines and I've seen some true crap even from the well-known organisations.
    So by all means go ahead with consistency but you'll end up having to produce
    most of everything at head office to be sure.\r\n\r\nI would say fonts are not
    totally culture-specific...a humanist sans is always friendlier than a realist
    monoline. However, there are fonts that are very much fashionable in one place
    rather than another. If you can separate a font's inherent appeal from the cultural
    associations you may have, I think it's possible to find one that speaks to everyone
    (presuming it supports the languages you need!)"

    If the country offices are using MS Word you'll have an uphill battle even just
    trying to keep to one font because when people cut and paste, the formatting <cite>always</cite>
    goes awry, especially when tables, page breaks, headers or bullets are involved.\r\n\r\nIf
    on the other hand your comms are designed by in-country comms teams or design
    agencies, they'll be using something like InDesign and you can specify everything
    down to hyphenation and justification.\r\n\r\n"

    just the place a custom typeface could be fitting, exactly because the cost won\u2019t
    look so high compared to the retail licensing fee for 80 (or more) offices. If
    you need to support other scripts than Latin, finding something affordable will
    be a hard task!"
