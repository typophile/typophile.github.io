  to try this http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap.html\r\n\r\nI've done
  a search and it didn't come up so maybe no-one's tried it. When I did a search for
  PC Font Viewers, Typograf seemed to come up as the preferred choice, however I thought
  it was pretty piss poor, the interface was out of the 1970's and half the options
  didn't work on XP64, I guess I'm used to Macs were the Font managment options are
  really good.\r\n\r\nHowever, Babelmap is not bad, I'm working mostly with OpenType
  fonts across platforms and BabelMap has very comprehensive unicode display options,
  plus it's donation ware. Anyhow hope this is helpful to anyone looking for a good
  Unicode font viewer.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've been using BabelMap for a while now. It's very useful, and it's free.
    The only thing it doesn't do that I wish it did is allow you to see glyphs in
    fonts that are not currently activated (installed).
