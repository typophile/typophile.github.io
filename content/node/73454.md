  body: The reason I asked was because I wanted to see how they indicated the font
    Avenir should be used in their identity collateral. Looking at an organization's
    identity guidelines helps me to better understand why and how a particular font
    should be used.

  body: "That's all fine, but usually these identity guides are not for just anyone
    to look at and study, they are specifically for other external bureaus that do
    specific work using that brand (in this case for the city of Amsterdam) - due
    to corporate restrictions and to avoid brand misuse etc.\r\n\r\nbut you know,
    go through to the channels above and see. Maybe you'll get lucky.\r\n"
