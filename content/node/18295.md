body: Hello fellow typophiles. I am curious what font is being used in this sample
  taken from the pages of the CSA Archive catalogue. It looks so common, yet I can't
  find a match, including the fonts that CSA has available on their site (although
  Tanek is close). Any help would be appreciated.

    close).

    body: 'Mark - I took a look at some variations of the Venus font, and it appears
      to have a pretty high midline (ex: the center bar of the E) in comparison to
      the sample.'

    pretty close. \r\n\r\nVery possible that the font they originally used is not
    digital."

    body: "I think I figured it out: the font is Alpin Gothic.\r\n\r\nI managed to
      track down an old CSA-related PDF that used the font. Sometimes you can get
      lucky using Acrobat's \"Document Properties\" to see what fonts were used in
      the document. So there's my tip of the day!\r\n\r\nThanks for everybody's help."

  body: "Heh, now it's my turn to question <em>your</em> i.d.: Alpin Gothic is a near
    knock-off of Alternate Gothic dating back to the Compugraphic days. It's currently
    part of the Monotype library (Compugraphic --> Agfa --> Agfa/Monotype --> Monotype
    Imaging):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=203180&grab_id=0&page_id=11343&query=alpin\r\n\r\nCSA
    may have used Alpin Gothic in the PDF you found, but it doesn't match the sample
    you posted. Notice particularly the S and G."

  body: "Mark surely nailed this with his Venus ID. An old VGC catalog shows Bold
    and Extrabold Condensed and, to my eye, your image matches the XBold. With the
    condensed variants of Venus, the crossbar of the E moves to pretty much mid-height
    - unlike the uncondensed fonts you likely looked at.\r\n\r\nI know of no digital
    version either. If you really need this exact font, you could always inquire at
    <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\" target=\"_blank\">Castcraft</a>
    regarding an Opti equivalent (or maybe you already ruled that out, Mark?). It
    would likely have a different name, though."

    did find another cut of Venus Condensed (in Jaspert's Encyclopedia) which has
    a higher waist, but samples in other sources generally looked like this. The weight
    doesn't quite match, but the earmarks are all there."

  body: 'Some idle speculation: The fonts that CSA sells are based on old metal and
    film faces, with some alterations. I believe these were developed originally for
    their own use and at some point they decided to sell them to the public. My guess
    is that they did not release everything and this is one of those that weren''t
    released. The faces they call Bigford and Manzo are from the Venus family.'

  body: "Thanks for posting a sample. You're right, I kind of jumped the gun with
    the Alpin Gothic ID. Definitely a variation of Venus condensed. The C is kind
    of a unique character too. To me this typeface really captures that retro look.\r\nSo
    just to confirm, the font \"Venus Bold Condensed\" is not currently avaiable in
    digital form? Would Alpin Gothic be the next best thing, or is there something
    closer that is available for purchase?"

  body: "As far as I know there is no digital version (although it appears that CSA
    may have made one for themselves).\r\n\r\nAlpin Gothic is a near copy of Alternate
    Gothic. Trade Gothic Bold Condensed is also similar. None of these would match
    this exactly, but they do have a similar overall look. I have heard that Font
    Bureau is releasing a font based somewhat on Venus called Vonnes (it's the one
    Macromedia has used for a while), but I don't know if there is a condensed like
    this or how similar it would be. Font Bureau's Bureau Grotesk also has some similarities."

  body: I beg to differ, my esteemed colleague, I think Bigford is based on Annonce
    Grotesque. The uppercase G sports a spur. ;^)

  body: "I did some more research. There does appear to be a Venus Bold Condensed
    by OptiFonts, although their web site doesn't offer much information. I'll try
    sending them an email.\r\n\r\nMark, I also noticed that you've commented on your
    fondness for the Venus family in a previous discussion. Ever thought of putting
    out your own version? I paid a visit to your site - very nice work."

  body: "It would be nice if a comprehensive digitization of Venus were done by somebody.
    (We have the technology!) Vonnes is nice, but it's a bit different than Venus,
    made to order by Neville Brody, if I remember correctly. There are bits and pieces
    of the Venus family scattered through several digital libraries. FT Bauer owns
    the design, but they have only released one font so far.\r\n\r\nYves--I'm sure
    you're right about Annonce. I didn't spend much time examining it."
