  \ Right now I've just thrown garamond on there.  I'm looking for something a bit
  more edgey, but still carries a sophisticated stance.  I've been searching forever
  and just cant seem find anything that complements it well.  Any suggestions would
  be greatly appreciated.  Thanks a bunch!.\r\n\r\n-one8e\r\n\r\n"
