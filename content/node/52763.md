  undertake in order to become a typographer. I have already graduated college with
  a degree in graphic design, but I would love to specialize in typography. Any ideas?
  Directions?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nErin"

  body: Hi there. Well, my first suggestion would be to try to find a design studio
    that does a lot of book or magazine design -- that would give you the opportunity
    to set large amounts of text. Book design, especially, will allow you to do more
    nuanced work than in other areas of design.

  body: "Book interior design is fine, but remember that a degree in graphic arts
    could be a disadvantage. Rich Hendel use to say that the best training for book
    interior designer was to be a compositor -- or a simply a reader.\r\n\r\nRemember
    that what's hot or new in the design world may address only a very small audience,
    which in a book is usually the wrong audience.\r\n\r\nOf course, Rich's degree
    was in commercial art, so it can't be too great a disadvantage . . ."

  body: "Pull a book text off the web. Project Gutenburg, maybe. Then set it as a
    trade book. Work out the problems. Start with prose, fiction or non-fiction. Then
    do the same with a poetry text. Work your way up to a complex academic work with
    all sorts of apparatus. Wrap your brain and eyes around long text. Find typographers
    who'd be willing to critique your work. Revise the work. Then you'll have the
    beginnings of a portfolio and you can start looking for staff work or freelance
    work.\r\n\r\nForty years ago I'd have suggested serving an apprenticeship, but
    that's gone these days.\r\n\r\nThere are many days when I wished I had done more
    formal study in graphic design or commercial art. Just to have my eyes open a
    bit wider than they usually are.\r\n\r\nGood luck. Keep your eyes on this site;
    at times we have enlightening discussions.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "If you are young and want to work with type, consider motion and the internet,
    rather than print.\r\nWouldn't those be growth areas, and don't they have room
    for growth?\r\nDo you like Trollb\xE4ck's work?\r\nFor the internet, the challenge
    is to get things which are pretty basic to print (which I'm sure you're already
    familiar with through your studies) to work online, in html and flash. And you
    have to wrap your head around screen rendering and hinting, and if you can figure
    that out, and how to make type look good on screen, then that would be valuable
    to typography."
