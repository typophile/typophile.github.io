body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DemolitionInDoosanBrochure_3656.jpg]\r\nThis
  is a generic sans -- I don't care which one -- with special treatment to represent
  demolition.\r\nI find the restrained treatment to be more effective than the customary
  extreme defacing of a font.\r\nI got it from a Doosan heavy equipment brochure.
  \ It also showed more words with the same treatment, which I did not get.\r\nI would
  appreciated any pointers as to the font name.\r\nI know it's not the one in a previous
  Demolition thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/84703\r\nIt did not spot it in a
  Google image search for \"fonts demolition\" or at \r\nhttp://lava360.com/attractive-distorted-fonts-free-download/\r\nDon"

  body: "Thank you Ryuk. As far as I can see Uptown is almost a match. \r\nI also
    like Impacted and some of the effects in Mr. Black and Rust Bucket.\r\nFollowed
    your link to DaFont's Destroy theme & during my journey through 56 pages of many
    ways and degrees of destruction I did find a font with some applicability to the
    shell hole concept in my other request: Malevolentz.\r\nDon"

    by Anthem Type.\r\nMore in the same vein: [[http://www.dafont.com/impacted.font|Impacted]],

    Headline, [[http://www.dafont.com/dirtybag.font|Dirty Bag]]\r\nHaving a look to
    some sections at DaFont could be helpful too, full of eroded post-treatment, most
    of time very well executed: [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=107|Fancy >
    Eroded]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=109|Fancy > Destroy]]. \r\nBest
    one so far for your 2 requests is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/rust-bucket|Rust
