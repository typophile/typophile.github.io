body: "A while back I downloaded some freeware from cnet.com with the following Publisher's
  description:\r\n\r\n\"This is a zipped file of over 4700 TrueType fonts (fonts.zip).
  They're freely available throughout the net. Just unzip them to a folder and install
  them as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThis was great, I thought, and planned to bundle a couple
  of hundred of them maybe with a software product I was writing and planning to sell.\r\n\r\nBut
  then I started looking at the info on these various fonts using \"Font Thing\".
  \ (Another great product, btw.)  Some of them would say \"Freeware\" but most of
  them did not, and had varying sorts of information in the Copyright section, e.g.:\r\n\r\n\"All
  Rights Reserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"All Rights Reserved.  Freeware.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not Distribute
  without Author's permission\"\r\n\r\n\"with the help of Jesus Christ_my Guardian
  Angels\"\r\n\r\n\"To register and get a sample disk send 15$ to...\"\r\n\r\n\"All
  Rights Reserved.  Distribute Freely.\"\r\n\r\n\"You many not sell this font or distribute
  any modified version without my written consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"This font was made by
  ___________ especially for you and is copyright Fanatico Productions 1997.\"\r\n\r\n\"copyright
  2002 by charlie.  @ caramel syrup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Freeware - may not be sold.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nConsidering
  that all of these were on a freeware product, why couldn't I redistribute some of
  them with my own product (regardless of info in copyright section)  if they were
  merely bundled in such a way that I wasn't \"selling' them as such (as for example
  a downloader could keep the fonts if he decided not to keep my product.)\r\n\r\nAlso
  to font designers, what would be your reaction to someone who you felt was using
  your font without permission.  Would you just send them a cease and decist letter
  initially or what.\r\n"

  body: "What's the rationale for inflicting these fonts on your customers? Especially
    if your criteria for picking them is based on freeness rather than quality.\r\n\r\nA
    better solution, especially if you're looking for 200 fonts, would be to engage
    with established, respected freeware font designers (like Ray Larabie) get their
    permission and help picking appropriate fonts, and cut them a modest check/royalty
    payment."

  body: 'I think members of this forum would universally agree that with the exception
    of very clearly delineated open source fonts, you should get permission from any
    designer whose work you wish to exploit. Hence narrowing your choices to those
    of respected freeware designers would save time and effort. '

  body: "sii-\r\n\r\nMy criteria is not exclusively freeness.\r\nMany of the fonts
    are excellent.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI could consider a royalty arrangement with
    Ray Larabie (if that's you) or anyone.  As far as picking appropriate fonts,  I
    just want a wide array of fonts available for the end user.  I'm looking for unusual
    fonts so the end user won't just be thinking in terms of Times New Roman.\r\n\r\nI
    take it you think I'm free to use the fonts I mentioned in the OP however I want.\r\n"

  body: "A font can have a \"copyright (c) So And So 2001. All rights reserved\" and
    still be distributable without permission. All the so-called \"free\" fonts I
    have made under the Sentinel Type brand may be distributed without permission
    provided all materials are included in the .ZIP package. My EULA texts explicitly
    state that users may distribute the fonts this way. Even so, the copyright notices
    in my font headers and accompanying materials reserve the intellectual property
    rights and commecial rights to the typeface designs and their commercial exploitation
    for me.\r\n\r\nIf the information packaged with the font does not define distribution
    criteria, check with each font maker and ask her or him. It's the only way to
    be certain. In theory if the EULA and / or copyright notice(s) do not specifically
    say \"Do not distribute without permission\", you are within your rights redistributing
    those fonts provided you don't do so at a profit. That could be problematic for
    you because you want to distribute the fonts with your software product, and if
    you are charging money for that product some font makers may try to argue their
    free fonts are helping you make a profit, and hold out their hand. All rights
    reserved usually means the maker reserves the rights to the intellectual property
    and the commercial rights to it for her or him self.\r\n\r\nBut check first. Play
    it safe.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    for a software company that bundles fonts (coincidentally about 200) with a commercial
    product. \r\n\r\nI would not trust the (c) strings, readme.txt or anything else
    I downloaded from the Web. I would always try to locate the original designer
    and talk to them directly.\r\n"

  body: "Copyright is a bundle of rights. For the U.S., the constituent rights are
    spelled out in \xA7106 of the Copyright Code, Title 17. One of these is \"the
    exclusive rights to do or authorize the following: . . . (3) to distribute copies
    or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer
    of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;\"\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"All rights
    reserved\" is usually redundant, since the U.S. Copyright Code now says that these
    rights automatically accrue to the owner unless explicitly traded away and authorized
    in writing.\r\n\r\nUnless you have documentation authorizing you to distribute
    the font(s) in question, I wouldn't do it. Even a copyright string statement might
    not be sufficient, since there is no guarantee that that statement was placed
    there by the copyright owner.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this does
    not constitute legal advice.\r\n\r\n-- K."
