  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am a publisher and want to buy a couple de fonts: a sans and a sans serif. With our designer we wrote this draft.
Coarse papers are used mainly for our books.</p>
<p>With sans we would like something in the line of Agenda Regular, but it remind me something of the old Britain superb school (g, a) with Johnston and Gill.
Perhaps something more «modern», just a little less ornamented although similar in beauty and rythm.</p>
<p>For the serif, we are not sure with the new Bembo recutt as in this forum the opinions were fifty/fifty, and some overused tendency was mentioned.
Of course our daily leader is Minion (with the marvelous Erhhardt in paralell) but we want a new one. We saw the fantastic Collis and Ruse by the gifted Noordzij&rsquo;s but they are overpriced 400% with our budget. 
(Trinité is a must but time and readers perhaps want something different.)</p>
<p>Adobe Text sounds good (a mix of Minions, Bembos, Jenson, etc) but we are afraid this is a font Adobe will give as a plus with software purchasing and the investment could be just a loss&hellip;
We checked the dutch foundries but what about the rest of Europe?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Paula, an indication of your budget could be useful - there are many contemporary serif (and sans to pair with) typefaces that could work well in book environment, and knowing - approximately - how much you may spend could be a starting point. Moreover, how much do you want to differ from Minion? Are you after an historically inspired font or a more original interpretation?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Our budget is 400 euros per item (roman, italic, bold, bold italic)</p>
<p>Minion works fatally well!
Weight, purity, legible, perfect italics, etc.
Is just that we need a second choice (we use Ehrhadt, Janson, Joanna, etc) but we want a new one. 
Collis sounds very interesting&hellip;</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Athelas<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by José Scaglione</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sabon Next<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by J. F. Porchez</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lyon Text<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Kai Bernau</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fresco<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Kai Bernau</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t forget to mention <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cycles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Sumner Stone, a great typeface performing well in book environment, which is available by contacting him.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yep! I cut and pasted the wrong text. And I endorse Kent Lew&rsquo;s excellent Whitman, one of the best typeface I&rsquo;ve ever used - and much more than an alternative to Joanna.</p>
<p>With such a budget, by the way, one could even afford some weights of, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lexicon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Bran De Does - a typesetter&rsquo;s dream come true.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cycles is an really great typeface, I have to say I am very content with it. I obtained it, when it was still under the normal license and it is to me a really perfect balanced serif font for extended text. It has a classic, old style inspired, appearance, a reasonable proportioned x-height, and the letters seem to harmonize well on a page. It does not have any too fancy features, as some old-style revivals or interpretations have (Garamond Premiere, Arno for example – they are beautiful, but a different category). Yet it is not as cold and sterile as some other typefaces are, like Times New Roman or according to some maybe even Sabon. I have to say I find it hard to find a classic looking text-face that would compete.</p>
<p>Having said that, I can only say that I have no experience how any font would behave in a professional environment, as I am not working in such. Although I printed with Cycles in ink, laser and offset, I am not the person who could evaluate its performance in a way that would matter to you.</p>
<p>Personally I like as well: [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=35|Andron]] (which has similar qualities to the mentioned cycles, but an almost universal character-set, on the other hand no optical sizing variations, like cycles), [[http://www.commercialtype.com/typefaces/lyon/lyon_text|Lyon]], [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/Rawlinson2|Rawlinson]] and [[http://www.type-together.com/Edita|Edita]]. All are a bit wider set than Minion, which I find a tad to condensed and tight.</p>
<p>If you publish as well in the German, Swedish, Brasilian or other language markets with diacritic marks, then have a look at this issue before you decide on a typeface:
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/40439">http://typophile.com/node/40439</a>
The before mentioned typefaces in my post all avoid this problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you are looking for, but as you mention the new Bembo, I assume that&rsquo;s Bembo book, you might have a look at [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams Caslon Text]]. It is also intended to capture the look of a classic metal font, in this case the &ldquo;dark but open&rdquo; look that Caslon, well printed in metal, had. I just recently went through the exercise of comparing it and Minion as far as economy. I was pleasantly surprised that used somewhat smaller size, it could match Minion in economy. Because it is a little wider, lighter, and a little looser spaced, it is equally as readable at the smaller size—well, more readable, but I am prejudiced.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a clean and modern look, I am also a huge fan of Whitman.</p>
