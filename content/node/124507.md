  body: "In my opinion the _LIFEGUARDS_ lettering is not from a digital font as such,
    but rather is based on the same lettering guide that Jeff Levine used for his
    font Three Day Pass JNL [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ThreeDayPassJNLAsLIFEGUARDSJKYBPO913_4938.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/three-day-pass/\r\nThe stenciled _9_ seems
    to be a variation and the stenciled _3_ is from another design that uses squared
    shapes.\r\n"
