<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello typophiles,
since I'm new to these forums I'll start off with a little about me:
I'm a Dutch Graphic Designer (recently Graduated) who's also into programming.
Recently I've been working on a script font for display sizes, the working title of the font is 'Lasagna' (that was the first word I wrote in it). It's my first ever attempt at a complete font, so any help/critique is welcome to improve it.
At this point it's just shapes in Illustrator, but I like the way it's coming along and might ask someone to help me make it into a working font.
Anyway, without further ado...

Because of the lettershapes I had a large number of overlaps, wich meant a need for ligatures:

thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>i really like this. its just the t letter can seem out of place at time like in didn't. you could get around this with ligatures of alternate characters once you make it a working font.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for looking.
Yes, I kinda have a love/hate relationship with that 't'. I feel like it's essential to the character of the font, but it also makes it a lot harder to get nice word-shapes. I'm dreading what will happen when I have to start making ligatures for vowels with diacritics followed by a 't' (ét, ït, etc.).
The seperate glyphs and ligatures thusfar.

<div class=commentbody>That "s" is unique, but it's also a major attention getter... look at me, I'm a random "s". It would be over kill for a word like assassin. Are you planning to do a more subtle alternative "s"? I think the "f" and "z" is also in a similar boats.
Also, the overall look reminds me more of a marker than a brush or nib. Is this intended, or did you not save the preview with anti-aliasing on. </div>

<div class=commentbody><em>the 's'</em> - yes, it's an attention grabber, although I think it works within most words, indeed a word like 'assassin' would be too much. I had already played around with a more 'normal' s-shape, but nothing definitive as of yet.
I'm not really sure what you mean with it being a <em>random s</em>. It's random because it's a break from the norm? My idea behind it was a mix between a 'cursive s' and a 'long s' (that's why it sticks out above an below of the x-height).
here's an example of your 'assasin' in both the regular as wel as an alternate/normalized 's':
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lasagna_assasin_4341.gif]
<em>more of a marker than a brush</em> - yes this was intentional, I didn't want to have too much contrast, so I opted for a oval brush, wich basicly gives the same effect as a marker. Although a marker would have even less contrast (imho).</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>What I meant by random was that it was a random "s" in the flow of the word, whether it was at the beginning, middle or end of the word it would still be very pronounced, effectively blurring the word as a whole.
It's really all in how your eye scans a line of text. Most people rarely read entire words (that's why people can usually read this without problems: <a href=http://www.funny-potato.com/read-this.html> Can You Read This? </a>)
With a unique "s" like yours it breaks up the flow of the eye as it tracks alone the text. It can be confusing to the reader, either appearing as if the word was actually several words smashed together, or it just slows the eyes down making reading laborious.
Does that make sense?
I would recommend creating a more standard "s" shape that doesn't bring as much attention to itself and using the long "s" as your alternative, or in a display/swash version of your font.
It's a very unique character and I'm not dissuading you from using it, I just think a more suitable "s" would better, more effective and expected.</div>

<div class=commentbody> The left-hand side of the lowercase ‘t’ looks odd unless there’s something beneath it, for example in word-initial position. Between the apostrophe and the ‘t’ in “didn’t” the empty space is particularly noticeable.
 Also, the ‘e-s’ join looks significantly different from other letter-s joins.

<div class=commentbody>There are a few spots where it gets really dark (e.g. the southeast corner of the 'a'). I'd recommend cheating a bit and thinning the strokes where necessary.

<div class=commentbody>thank you all.
I've been working on the different 's'-es (a normal, a cursive and the swash) as well as a regular 'z' and 'f'. I havn't yet made my mind up what to do about the 't', maybe I just need to give it some more time. I agree with the heaviness in some parts and will look into that as well.
I will post my progress a.s.a.p. - but first I'm off to celebrate my birthday ;)</div>
