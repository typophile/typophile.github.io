  there is a "Typostammtisch" or equivalent there.

  body: You're quick, Nina! Good idea. Do you know other potentially interested people
    in Basel? As I am new here, I don't really know where to find typophiles -- but
    certainly not in my branch. Maybe we could meet together and plan something?

    href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?page_id=655\">Type Meet-Ups calendar</a>, I will
    surely make my way down there eventually. Who knows\u2026 other freewheeling,
    DeutscheBahn BahnCard-100\u2013owning typophiles might make it down there, too.
    Frequent customers like us can ride the ICE trains down to the Basel SBB Bahnhof
    for free!"

  body: "Sounds good, Dan! Yes, Basel is quite accessible from Germany too (and France).
    \r\nPaul, I know at least one person in Basel who might be interested, plus a
    few people in other areas of Switzerland that might make it down here \u2013 I
    mean Zurich for example is like an hour away. But it would certainly be nice to
    get more of a Basel-based \"core\" going. Are you connected to the School of Graphic
    Design (or whatever they call it now)? There should be plenty of typophiles there.
    But I don't think I know anyone there.\r\nIn any case, feel free to drop me an
    email at altairas_eye at mac dot com to discuss things further."

    with the graphic scene, that's the problem (I'm a theologian). Nevertheless, a
    meeting with three or four of us would be a nice start. I'll send you a mail."
