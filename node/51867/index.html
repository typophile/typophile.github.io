  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is my first attempt at a serif text typeface. This is by no means anything super original (in fact, it seems to have some similarities with Alex Heilmair&rsquo;s lovely Paulista Serif a few posts below). I just wanted to try doing something that actually looked like it might be able to hang out at a fancy party with Garamond and Charter and not run home crying because it&rsquo;s not classy enough.</p>
<p>After looking at it closely, I see several problems, and I&rsquo;m hoping you can point out anything else that looks weird or inconsistent (either within the typeface or with common practice).</p>
<p>• The curves in the &ldquo;S&rsquo;s&rdquo; seem a  bit heavy
• The &ldquo;B&rdquo; and the &ldquo;R&rdquo; need some refinement in the curves
• the lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo; looks a little weird. This was my first attempt at a two story &ldquo;a&rdquo; and something just doesn&rsquo;t seem right, but I&rsquo;m not sure what.
• this was also my first attempt a lowercase &ldquo;g&rdquo; and it looks pretty good, except I&rsquo;m thinking that maybe the stroke in the bottom half is a little thick</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is working well. Suggestions:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d raise your t&rsquo;s crossbar. 
Maybe widen the h (and perhaps u/n)? 
Looks like X wound up a touch short. 
The g is attractive but might be a little too bouncy in character for this crisp font.
The S looks almost monoline - I would make its thins thinner. R gets too thick in the middle, too. 
r seems a little heavy, and s seems a little light.
The top terminal of c and r need some work.
Consider losing, or changing, the bottom serif of the b.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I feel like doing a long post. ;)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lowercase:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->a:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Left side of top terminal has a strange bulge on it. Could use smoothening. I also don&rsquo;t like the bowl. Consider making the top part of the bowl more like how the bowl on the b joins the stem (i.e. bending slightly downwards and slimming down). The a is currently the only character that has such a bowl. Also the only top terminal that is diagonal.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->b:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I would lose the bottom serif on the b aswell.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->c:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The top terminal of the c is also bothering me a bit. Consider changing it so that it doesnt bend down as much as it does now (so make the top more like the bottom, but with a serif). Terminal serif maybe a bit short?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->d:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The bottom join of the bowl to the stem needs some more space, exactly like you did on the u.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->e:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It looks like the e is slightly rolling to the left. It probably only needs a tiny bit of tweaking here and there to counter this. I&rsquo;m also not sure about the vertical cut-off on the bottom terminal, although it doesn&rsquo;t really break style or anything like that.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->f:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Try to bring the crossbar to the x-height. I understand why you placed it lower (I&rsquo;ve done it too), but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary in this case. Could it also have a similar top terminal as a and c?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->g:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Interesting shape, I do like it, but it needs some polishing. Eliason is probably right; it might be a bit too interesting for this typeface.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->h:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Might be slightly too narrow.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->i:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> See &lsquo;u&rsquo;
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->j:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> See &lsquo;u&rsquo;
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->k:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Top stroke is too heavy. Bottom one should be heavier than top one. I also think the k is too wide. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->m:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Might be slightly too narrow.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->n:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Might be slightly too narrow.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->p:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Bottom serif on the side of the bowl could be longer (to the right) This makes the letter stand stronger on it&rsquo;s &lsquo;feet&rsquo; (your r has exactly what I mean).
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->q:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Use it as reference for the b.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->r:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The ear is way too long. It needs to be at least 50% shorter.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The spine (the middle, diagonal part) needs to be heavier. It has to have the same optical (not mathematical) weight as your heaviest available stroke.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->t:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Crossbar, see f. Also the vertical cut-off again on lower right, looks kind of harsh.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->u:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The pointed tops of the u extend above the x-hight (overshoot). Yet, you don&rsquo;t do this on the i, j, m, n, p and r. Probably better to make that consistently the same. It can probably use some overshoot, judge by eye.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->v:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I can&rsquo;t really decide, but it looks like it might be slightly too wide. Also a bit of balance, i.e. it leans to the right. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->w:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Can&rsquo;t judge it well, can&rsquo;t seem to find any in the lipsum texts. Middle apex might be leaning to the right.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->x:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Looks pretty good, although the lines crossing each other needs to be optically corrected. See [[http://typophile.com/node/51421|this thead]] for what I mean.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->y:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Also pretty good, although the tail is quite fragile.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->z:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Is a bit heavy, because of the horizontals.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uppercase:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The left stroke is heavier on the top than on the bottom (it flares). Also the crossbar may be a bit too high. It does not need to be the same as the e etc., make it optically right. I feel it should be a bit lower. Look at weight of crossbar.**
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Compared to the O and Q, the D might be narrow.*
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->D:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Compared to the O and Q, the D might be narrow.*
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->E:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Look at weight of crossbar.**
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->F:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Look at weight of crossbar.**
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->G:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Compared to the O and Q, the D might be narrow.*
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->H:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Can&rsquo;t judge it in context, but it looks a bit narrow. Look at weight of crossbar.**
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->K:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Same critiques as with the lowercase k. Top arm a bit too heavy. Character width needs looking at.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->P:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Maybe it looks better if the bottom part of the stroke - where it joins the stem - slightly thins down. Also the heavy part of the bowl seems to be on the bottom right, while for the rest the weight is mostly vertical.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->R:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I would probably attach the leg/tail directly to the 5-o-clock position on the bowl, instead of making it come from the stem (so bascially an edited P with a leg/tail).
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->S:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Too much weight on te shoulders (the two parts that look like hooks :p ), the weight should be on the spine. See lowercase s comments.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->V:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> See lowercase v comments.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->W:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Much too narrow. Proportion the V and W to each other like you did with the lowercase.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->X:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> See lowercase x comments.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Z:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> See lowercase z comments. Look at horizontals.**</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want classic proportions.
** Should probably be optically the same weight.</li>
