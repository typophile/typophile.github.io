  in East Asia, died Tuesday night in Paris. She had been battling cancer the last
  couple of years.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from the wake being held at the Korean
  Cultural Centre in Paris. At the entrance, they were showing a short video about
  one of her achievements\u2014her identification of the oldest extant book printed
  with movable metal type in the world. This reminded me that she made a valuable
  contribution as a type historian. I've decided to share a bit of her story, since
  she is not well known outside of Korea.\r\n\r\nPark came to France in 1955 at the
  age of 27 for her graduate studies, the first Korean woman to do so. In 1967, she
  started working as a librarian at the National Library of France. It was there that
  she made the aforementioned discovery. She came across an old book titled [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jikji|Jikji]],
  a collection of Buddhist sayings. There were annotations in French on the cover
  declaring that this was the oldest printed book from foundry type dating from 1377.
  This was confirmed in the last page of the book itself, which contained the dates
  and circumstances of its printing in a Korean Buddhist temple\u2014that it was printed
  with \"letters made from molten metal\". The book itself had been in the collection
  of the first French consul to Korea Collin de Plancy (1853-1924).\r\n\r\nAt the
  time, Gutenberg's 42-Line Bibles from the 1450s were the oldest known book printed
  from movable metal type. So Park knew she was on to a revolutionary discovery, one
  she would have to back up with evidence. She would have to prove that the document
  was printed with individual characters made of metal, not blocks of wood on which
  an entire page would be carved.\r\n\r\nHaving to learn everything from scratch,
  Park almost started a fire three times trying to cast type at home. She obtained
  old metal typefaces from print shops and made prints with them. The breakthrough
  came when she discovered that the burrs on the edges of metal typefaces can leave
  their marks in print. This, added to the fact that the characters did not align
  exactly and some symmetric characters like \u65E5 or \u4E00 were printed upside
  down, was enough evidence that the document was indeed printed with movable metal
  type. Jikji was presented at the 1972 l'Ann\xE9e des livres exhibition organized
  by the National Library of France and changed the way we understand the early history
  of printing, bringing attention to the developments in East Asia a century before
  Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this contribution on the history of printing, her
  work as a scholar was varied and fascinating, given her unique status as an archival
  historian of Korean origin residing in France. I saw her once from afar, when she
  had just returned from Korea for cancer treatment, but never got to meet her. She
  was doing research and writing books until the end. May she rest in peace."

    Repatriate Korean Archive Dies".
