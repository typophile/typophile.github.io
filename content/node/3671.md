  of this typeface which move in closer and the letterforms become intertwined within
  one another becoming unreadable establishing a sense of privacy for the writer and
  the letters they write. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28848.jpg"

    <BR>Here is examples of my typeface. The typeface starts off readable and gets
    unreadable when the author does not want to reveal what is actually being said.

  body: I think this is a great concept. Will it be simple selection, or will there
    be some programming involved?

  body: My typeface comes in five different variations, &#34;Community Privacy 1&#34;
    to &#34;Community Privacy 5.&#34; Each variation has its own suitcase listed seperately
    in the list of fonts.  I came about the system as I studied different codes and
    rating systems, such as the terrorist alert warnings, sex offender ratings, gaming
    system ratings, movie ratings, braille, etc.  I decided as to label my fonts with
    a basic numbering system of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. As a person feels their message is
    non-readable a person would type with  &#34;Community Privacy 5&#34; and so on.  This
    is mostly based off movie and gaming system ratings with a reference to the sex
    offender numbering.
