  title=\"Microsoft\u2019s Creative Destruction\">According to Dick Brass</a>, a former
  Microsoft VP, it was internal political sabotage: \r\n\r\n\u201C[O]ther Microsoft
  groups\u2026 felt threatened by our success. \r\n\r\n\u201CEngineers in the Windows
  group falsely claimed it made the display go haywire when certain colors were used.
  The head of Office products said it was fuzzy and gave him headaches. The vice president
  for pocket devices was blunter: He\u2019d support ClearType and use it, but only
  if I transferred the program and the programmers to his control. As a result, even
  though it received much public praise, internal promotion and patents, a decade
  passed before a fully operational version of ClearType finally made it into Windows.\u201D\r\n\r\n(Via
  Vince Connare\u2019s Facebook.)"

  body: "> So: Why did it take ten years to get ClearType turned on by default?\r\n\r\nI'd
    put it closer to 8 and a half years, and the answer in my opinion is \"because
    of CRTs and Vista\". The technology announced towards the end of 1998 missed Windows
    2000 (came in a bit too late) and shipped with Windows XP in 2001 - that's three
    years. With CRT's still in the majority it didn't make sense to make it the default,
    although many laptop OEMs, including all tablet makers did turn it on. I think
    it was always the plan to make it the default setting for Longhorn (based purely
    on LCD panel penetration), but the schedule slipped - Vista shipped in Jan 2007
    - about 8 years after CT was announced. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the irony in the article's title: \"Microsoft's Creative Destruction\".\r\nIt's
    an allusion to economist Joseph Schumpeter's phrase, \"Creative Destruction\"
    to describe how the process of entrepreneurial innovation destroys what came before.\r\nSchumpeter
    was being laudatory. \"Creative Destruction\" is a good and necessary thing.\r\n\r\nBrass
    - or an editor at the NYTimes - cleverly uses the term to describe another kind
    of destruction: one that frustrates and defeats exactly the kind of innovative
    birthing that Schumpeter's phrase was coined to describe.\r\n\r\nCool. A double
    entendre. Somebody's on the ball. \r\n"

  body: "The more fundamental question is: Why should sub-pixel rendering be turned
    on by default at all? Despite all the arguments for it and against aggressive
    hinting (as laid out in extensive detail by the <a href=\"http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/index.html\">Anti-Grain
    Geometry project</a>), it remains a subjective and personal decision whether \"the
    trade-off between sharpness and functionality\" is worth it.\r\n\r\nI've tried
    ClearType many times over the years, and every time I end up turning it off after
    a few days because I continue to find it unpleasant. Has anyone ever done a scientific
    study (with large sample size) on whether the \"common\" computer user actually
    prefer one over the other, and by what margin?"

  body: "Except for processor speed issues, the case for ClearType would seem clear.
    After all, compare how one can, on an ordinary TV set, read printing in real typefaces
    in things like movie credits or titles, compared to computer printing at a similar
    resolution.\r\n\r\nIt is true, of course, that if sub-pixel rendering is allowed
    to turn hinting off, you will get situations where a lowercase \"e\" looks like
    a dot. So one does need a high enough screen resolution before it is useful."
