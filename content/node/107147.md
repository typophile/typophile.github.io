  very similar to Report School font. \r\nThe letter S is specific, I believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    by Colophon but can't be positive that's it. What's the sample origin?"

    the sample from this site [[http://www.thedesignfilesopenhouse.com | thedesignfilesopenhouse.com]]."

    Google Chrome extension]] as it's embedded as WebFont. That's [[http://www.batfoundry.com/catalogue_9_wigrum_.html|Wigrum]]
    by Bureau des Affaires Typographiques (BAT). It looks like to mix influences from
    Futura, aforementioned Aper\xE7u and [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2|Neutraface
    2 HI]]. First time seeing it in action. Thanks!"

  body: "Oh, now I see... they have some text set in Wigrum. \r\nMy first thought,
    after I read your post, was: How he can see with Whatfont what font it is, if
    it's an image, not font? He must have some new voodoo version of Whatfont!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!"
