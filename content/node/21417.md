  body: It's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/elston-rr/?refby=typographica">Elston</a>
    - but I haven't seen much of it. Maybe you're thinking of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.117386.0.3">Neo
    Sans</a>?

  body: "Thanks Steven thats it. (although the sample, despite being called light,
    seems to be more bold than the example?)\r\n\r\nYeah, I am familiar with Neo Sans,
    but specifically the S in Elston I have seen a lot lately on some sites. It also
    always reminds me of the Volvo branding font."

  body: I believe Elston was derived from the same source as <a href="http://typophile.com/node/3875">Volvo
    Broad</a>, the Volvo proprietary face.
