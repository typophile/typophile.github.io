  body: Diggin it. For some reason it reminds me of the 3M logo. It has the same solid
    foundation but is very approachable at the same time. I'm curious how it would
    look with the cap F at the x-height. Might give it a cool balance. Or it may look
    totally dumb. Never know till ya try it!

  body: "also diggin it - majorly. it's gor a fuller feel to it.\r\n\r\nhowever something
    about the 'F' and the 'e' (or maybe it's just the 'e' actually I think that's
    what it is) seems out of place - needs some weight contrast or something.\r\n\r\nand
    the e seems like it smells to the other letters i.e, kerning ;)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br

    I think it is very strong and works very well.
