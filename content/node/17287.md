  I'm pretty stuck here.I thought maybe some of you can advise me on some points with
  this project.\r\nWhat i sould basicly do with this project was to choose a font.
  divide every letter into elements like I show at the top of the attachment.I chose
  the the font, I divided it and tried to make a new font out of it.\r\n\r\nWell the
  thing is now I have this,but I'm not satisfied with a lots of things,\r\nMaybe you
  should look and tell me your comments then I'll tell you the parts that I'm not
  satisfied with.\r\n\r\nThank in advance \r\n\r\nLazyfish\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The font you've created is not legible yet. A good font is designed for maximum
    legibility and one of the ways that happens is through simpliciation of forms.
    There are too many things happening in your design. My suggestion is; if you're
    going to take this approach of changing an existing font, start over and make
    only subtle tweaks. Every modification here that's distracting is essentially
    a point against legibility. \r\n\r\nKeep working!\r\n\r\n-_- Marty"

    body: "hi there and thanks for the reply,\r\nThe thing is I'm a design student
      and this is my term project,personally i didn't like the idea of taking a font
      and dividing it to elements but what you gonna do, you know....\r\nAnyways what
      I tried to show in the attachent was not a final look of the font but the different
      types of letters (like g and y) I mean I'm trying to find out a structure with
      these elements so that I'll be able to use for the rest.I'm not modifying the
      font, I'm taking elements from it and trying to create a totally different font.\r\nSo
      could you please be a little bit specific about the letters but not in general,\r\n"

  body: "I'd love to give you lots of specifics but it's hard to get a feel for your
    concept or even the visual language you're seeking. The important thing now is
    to focus on the problems that you can identify and begin experimenting on tracing
    paper until you find a good solution. Stay away from working in the computer right
    now because it will only kill your progress. No computer is faster than the pencil.
    \r\n\r\nKeep asking yourself this...\r\n\r\nWhat's making this illegible?\r\n\r\nI
    would suggest rethinking the size and shape of your counter-spaces. The negative
    space within letters (like d and g) feels too busy and narrow. Perhaps get rid
    of the flat mantelpieces on the bottom left of each counter and just create a
    curve to round them out. The top part of your counter-spaces works ok because
    you've got the same thing happening in your other letters like \"n\". But again,
    they're not an identical match in proportion. Is there a reason why they're different?
    Copy and paste your path. The \"r\" and \"s\" need more attention. They feel chunkier
    than everything else and visually they need to look less like distant cousins
    and more like immediate family.\r\n\r\nCreate a system!\r\n\r\nCreate consistency.
    I'd get rid of the little random chunks at the bottom of the \"a\" and \"e\".
    On your \"g\" and \"y\", i'd make the descenders align to the grid and consider
    having them be the exact same shape with only enough variation to differenciate
    between them. You'll have to go back to the sketch pad for that. \r\n\r\nHope
    my opinions help!\r\n\r\n-_- Marty"

    dunno about that - certainly not \"maximal\". But yes, I agree that\r\nlegibility
    is a central factor (although a lot less in a display face).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "As I understand it, the assignment you've been given is to take one typeface,
    break it down into elements, and then reassemble it to form a new typeface.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    what's needed is a wider definition of \"elements\", and looser rules about how
    to reassemble them. For instance, you seem to have forbidden yourself even to
    rotate your puzzle pieces. And you've made life even harder for yourself by choosing
    pieces that are hard to use graphically. The rectangle and a quarter ellipse are
    just not from the same world as the subtle curves on the s stroke and the finnicky
    little sprig on the small stroke.\r\n\r\nI must second Marty's point: every typeface
    needs a system! If some characters have big round serifs and others don't, why?\r\n\r\nFinally,
    before you decide you've arrived at a workable system, make sure you have dealt
    with the characters h a m b u r g e f o n t s i and v. If your system deals with
    these well, it will probably make it through the rest of the lower case.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck!\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "Ok, I think this is much better already, but there are still two ideas in
    this design: triangle and rounded endings.\r\n\r\n\"abcdegjosuvwy\" are consistent.\r\n\"fhiklmnrtx\"
    are still schizophrenic, i'd get rid of the rounded endings, but cut them straight.
    This works, because the other characters do have straight lines by themselves.\r\nDon't
    try to overstress your concept. in \"s\" and \"t\", there's a too much of elements,
    maybe as well in \"v\" and \"w\".\r\n\"x\" is still strange, i would simplify
    it.\r\nget rid of the right triangle in the \"m\".\r\nTry to avoid \"chinese-calligraphic
