  shape I need for two letters (c and f), I may have to create them in illustrator,
  but wanted to check if whats out there, so, can anyone give advice on how to find
  fonts, is it a case of just putting the time in on font sites, I find that I can
  spend days doing this, there are so many, the categories help to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nAppreciate
  any help.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    things down a little. It will ask you a series of questions about the face you're
    looking for, like \"Serif or sans?\" or \"Is the crossbar on the A angled or straight?\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/\r\n"
