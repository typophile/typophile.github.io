body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m working on a serif text font, it has constructed elements
  of a slab serif, but also some of the Old Style genre.\r\nThe idea is, to design
  the typeface more squarish, with superelliptical shapes \u2013 to produce a strong
  horizontal impression and keep the counterspaces more open.\r\nWhat do you think?
  Every comment is welcome.\r\n"

  body: "Looking nice so far.\r\n\r\nIn your PDF, the bottom paragraph of sample text
    seems spaced more than the lines above \u2013 is that just an optical effect?\r\nFor
    some reason Acrobat shows spaces where I'd expect \"fl\" and \"ffi\" ligatures,
    such as in \"advice from official bodies\", though."

  body: "How nice to be in Typophile Critique again, giving help to people well above
    my ability.\r\nThe top part of /g is dark.\r\nThe lowercase /o gives the impression
    of being significantly squarer than everything else. Necessary differences make
    a text face, of course, but to carry it through I would at least suggest that
    the top of /a be a bit more flat and square somehow."

    spacing and kerning is not finished and ligatures are still missing \u2026\r\n\r\n@Cerulean:
    I corrected /g /o /a as you see in the second line."

    with less pronounced serifs it might be a real nice font for terminals and programming\u2026"

    body: Right, it is intended for text and I will think about your proposal. Maybe
      I do a second version with lower serifs later.

  body: In the sample above I replaced the teardrops with rectangled terminals to
    go further with the idea of a squarish serif. What do you think?

  body: I believe the /a needed its terminal as it was but I like the other changes.
    Perhaps /r would benefit from more experiments in either direction.

    be adjusted later. But \u2013 what do you think about contrast and shapes?"
