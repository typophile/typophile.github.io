Our main focus is web but we do some of everything. The short version of my web-design philosophy is that everything should be done in the cleanest and most technologically &quot;correct&quot; way I can. This includes adherence to web-standards, accessibility, future-proofing, etc. while at the same producing visually appealing solutions that lack needless complexity. I probably sound like a pompous  saying it. but that's what I do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The logo is only made up of only one primary triangle, the one used for the wings. The shapes in the middle are made from the triangle. The triangle it self is a golden triangle. And the shapes in the middle are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Penrose Tiles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (these tiles can cover an infinite space and never create a repeating pattern).  There are only two edge lengths used in the entire logo, and they are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->golden ratio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Mathematically speaking the longer length is 1 +  Ø long and the shorter length is 1 + 1/Ø long. (Not exactly the correct symbol for phi, but this forum eats HTML entities.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The goal of the logo was to create a simple and recognizable mark that betrayed the complex exactness that it is built on. Which is what I try to do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, have at it!  And thank you in advance for your thoughts!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tanya: I would say that the chaos part is all about the inspiration. Pulling all the random pieces together and 'mint'ing them into something well defined. Also it ties in with the use of penrose tiles(unrepeatable patterns), and golden ratio (an irrational number). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pronunciation: It is pronounced mint-chaos. I don't think I'll have a problem with people getting it. I've been operating under the name for a few years. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul: Thank you for your comments, and yes, this mark has been harder for me than anything else I've worked on. I've revised it to not be tracked so loosely. I'm pretty sure I can see the value, but if anyone can explain (or point me to some information) about why, from a typographical standpoint this is unwise I'd love to hear it. Typography is one of my weaker design areas and is something I'm trying to learn more about.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are the new, and probably final versions. I've decided to go with the original (fig 1 above) design). I think it's stronger and more focused. And as a friend said &quot;#1 looks like an 'M' but #2 looks like <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Pom Pom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have toned down the 'g' in design a bit as Andrew suggested. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The colors are still up in the air somewhat. Except for that green, I really like that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I want to print the ghosted repeating line that is behind the logo in the business card as a spot varnish, not as an actual inked color/value. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you all for your input!

		<div class="commentbody">Hey if I can add my two cents:  I don't have a problem understanding your concept and name, though I must admit because &quot;mintchaos&quot; is one word, it can have a tendency not to resonate clearly upon initial glancing&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the altered &quot;g&quot;: I think the reason why some people have a problem with it, is because it sticks out and seems to aggravate a seemingly cohesive and symmetrical design&hellip;perhaps this can be remedied by having the logo graphic be unsymmetrical in some way.  If some other part or section between the graphic and the typography were not so balanced, the altered g would not cause such a stir&hellip;this is what I see in my mind's eye, so forgive me if reality proves this advice otherwise&hellip;but I do feel you are very close to having this solution finalized.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First off, thanks to all of you for your comments, they have been quite helpful.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm working on some new versions of the type that I should have ready to post tomorrow sometime. Trying to visually break up mint and chaos to increase recognition, without hurting the flow of the design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm trying some versions that don't have 'design' in them at all. Because that is not all I do, and because it will make the logo more versatile. I am not pleased at all with how the above version looks horizontally.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm also trying some other fonts, although I really like <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Target<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I keep coming back to it. I'll show you were all of that is going tomorrow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as the symbol goes, I'm in love with it, and doubt it will change. I think it will serve me well over time. Everyone seems to see different things in it: Darth Vader,  origami, a rocketship, a kite, a KKK mask, a nun. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daniel: I really like this color of green. And while it isn't 'mint' in the artificial sense of the word it isn't all that far off from the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> real thing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott: I took the shading out of the symbol to purify the internal shapes. I'm still undecided over which one I like better. I think both styles work well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Christian, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the logo. I think it is a good idea to try other typefaces, but if you just adjust the spacing, as Scott pointed, it is fine to me. (the 1.5 g doesn't disturbs me) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About the green, well, I think you should go with the &quot;artificial&quot; one insted. This one is not &quot;fresh&quot; enough for me, too yelow&hellip; :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One last thing, the golden ratio is not related to phi (0,314&hellip;) but to other letter which name I don't remember (0,618&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's it, congratulations for the nice logo, and good luck with the improovements! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
