  body: Yes, that cut was where I first went.  Granjon's recent cut for Adobe was
    next, but, nothing seems to match the ruthlessly sharp/chiseled/slim appearance
    of the Kosuth piece(s).  It's the nicest variant I think I've ever seen in terms
    of a display-style face.

  body: "Strange...case closed, and quickly!\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/orig-garmnd/\r\n\r\nHadn't
    seen or heard of this, odd name.  Will look into it's backstory, I wonder what
    material it sourced. Very nice. \r\n\r\nedit: Original Garamond is a font from
    Bitstream library. Based on the series of Garamont romans shown in the Egenolff-Berner
    specimen sheet printed in 1592, this design is a good sharp cut; it suffers from
    very short descenders made to fit it on the German standard alignment of the period,
    which was based on Blackletter proportions."

  body: "Hi Richard:\r\n\r\nStempel was a foundry that was acquired by Linotype in
    the early 80\u2019s, but during that time very few were fonts were released as
    digital type. Bitstream was the first in 1981. Bitstream did many digitizations
    of Monotype and Linotype fonts, but\u2014for example\u2014Stempel Garamond could
    not be called Stempel Garamond by Bitstream because it was a copyrighted name,
    hence placeholder names like Original Garamond was used instead of Stempel Garamond.\r\n\r\nBitstream
    has licensed fonts to ParaType and Tilde. These foundries specialize in Cyrillic
    for Russian customers and have modified the fonts for that purpose. I recommend
    that you check the character set(s) to make sure that it has all the letters and
    symbols you need because many have been overwritten with Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nIf you
    plan on using this for serious text work. You need to skip the Bitstream, Tilde,
    and the Paratype versions\u2014 they don\u2019t have the necessary small caps.\r\n\r\nI
    too love Stempel Garamond, but I find it so compromised I use a contemporary alternative:\r\n\r\nMerlo:\r\nhttp://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=206\r\nhttp://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=64\r\n\r\nIf
    you go back to my link to myfonts, type the @ symbol\u2014 they all look wobbly
    or lousy or taken from Times Roman. The same goes for all the other analphabetic
    glyphs. Merlo was made from scratch an is entirely harmonious. So are the fabulous
    ones below.\r\n\r\nOther excellent alternatives are:\r\n\r\nFF Maiola:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_maiola_pro/\r\n\r\nHoefler
    Text:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100010\r\n\r\nVerdigris:\r\nhttp://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/verdigris/pk_verdigris.htm\r\n\r\nSabon
    Next:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html\r\n\r\nHope I helped
    you,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n\r\nPS... It was/is often the case with the old Linotype
    and Monotype types that only the text version of the fonts were digitized. Many
    display versions that are sharper and prettier are still sitting in cabinets collecting
    dust. Maiola is the sharpest of all the alternatives yet it is good for text too."

  body: "thanks mike.\r\nim pretty much set, this is strictly for display type.  artificially
    (uniformly) thinning Original Garamond brings an identical match, more or less,
    to the Kosuth source type. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/more_6117.jpg]"
