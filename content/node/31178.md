  Olympic bid.\r\nWe do have some research collected, but there's so much nice stuff
  out there i'm sure that you guys know of.\r\n\r\nAnything from fonts made for different
  olympics, graphic manuals, moodshots, anything you can think of.\r\n\r\nOur project
  is a winter olympic, but all the stuff that's integrated into summer olympics are
  also relevant.\r\n\r\nTypography is very interesting, i know there was a font at
  fountain.nu that was bought by (Vancouver's?) olympic bid to be their proprietary
  font, but i cant seem to find it any longer.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    some articles after searching typophile, but not many on the typography itself."
