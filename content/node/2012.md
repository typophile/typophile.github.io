    for a year, then once they have a customer base they save money by dumping the
    franchise and just changing some signs. Or sometimes not even: I remember a Tony
    Roma&#39;s on Cayman Islands that was no longer a Tony Roma&#39;s, except it still
    said so... And in Beirut there&#39;s &#42;two&#42; Hard Rock Cafes, but only one
    of them is the real thing - except you can&#39;t tell which! <BR> <BR>BTW, I think
    for Michelle&#39;s it was the donut cook who redid the signage... <BR> <BR>hhp '
