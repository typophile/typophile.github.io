    it is a\r\n n, n,  a....... diagonal... It looks like some kind of shiny metal...\r\nThe
    second is the a D, o, n....\r\nThanks for being so helpful..\r\nI guess we just
    got started off on the wrong foot.....\r\nI don't know much about font programs
    and downloading them...\r\nI am just trying to make pictures with my friends names
    on them... I pretty much like the real fancy fonts...\r\nBut.... When I find one
    I like I can't seem to find it to find out the name....There are pages on FB that
    make them for people also, but I can't tell them which font to use because I don't
    know the name...\r\nCan people buy font programs or do they have to be downloaded
    from the Internet....\r\nIf there is a program, can you pick which fonts you want?\r\nOne
    lady told me she had over 2000 fonts...\r\nWhere did she get them?\r\nhhp....
    Where are you from?\r\nYou seem to know a lot about fonts .....\r\n "

    which ones these are....?\r\nIf  you click on Alfred Drake above it will take
