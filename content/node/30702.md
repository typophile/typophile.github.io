  body: "This is one of the brush scripts from old film types. The digitization of
    it I have is called 'Klakson', and the only difference I see is the tails on your
    sample's letters are slightly longer. We get these posted now and then, and they
    are all quite similar. You might be able to find this, as it comes from an old
    Expresiv Font collection no longer sold, and such fonts have a way of getting
    out on the web.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: The original was Filmotype's Hunter Script. I know of no digital version (Castcraft/Opti
    maybe?), so hopefully you can find a copy of Mike's suggestion.

  body: "The Solotype Catalog (pp. 104-5) shows Hunter Script and two other weights
    of the same basic script called Jester and Hindu. The A is characteristic in all
    three. The Expresiv Brush Font collection says the font names and files were copyright
    1994 by MacArtist, Inc., but obviously they were digitizations of existing film
    types.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
