body: "Hi all, \r\nI'm looking for alternatives to a typeface that is not available
  in electronic form, as far as I can tell from my searches.\r\nThe face is called
  'Quadra', designed in 1970 by Rudolph de Harak. Can anyone suggest something that
  closely resembles this?\r\nCheers.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quadra-font.gif]"

  body: Paul's right. But if you don't want to worry about the spacing and font production
    part, you could try <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PY.114299.0.0">P22
    De Stijl.</a>, tho it's much more symmetrical.
