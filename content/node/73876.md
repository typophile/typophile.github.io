  research effort [\u2026] a low-cost eye-tracking apparatus & custom software that
  allows graffiti writers and artists with paralysis resulting from Amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis to draw using only their eyes.\"</cite>\r\nhttp://www.eyewriter.org/\r\n\r\nIs
  this new? Have we discussed this yet? I'm finding this quite fascinating. \r\nAnd
  I mean they're drawing letters, too. :-)"

    systems research, eye tracking, and Hollywood 3D animation. Some really cool \xDFhit!
    Thanks for sharing!"

  body: Theunis, to get very big money to do this kind of research, defense department
    kinds of funding are needed.  When jet fighters got too fast for reaction time
    of pilots, they designed away to have them just look at a target to site it rather
    than having to operate some mechanical device.  I am just glad that the research
    can also be used to do something less harmful than shooting weapons.
