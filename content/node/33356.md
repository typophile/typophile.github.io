  years ago that was featured in a lot of magazines that consisted of a pop-out die-cut
  fold-up Mini-Cooper? \r\n\r\nI'm looking for a photo of this if anyone might have
  it..."

  body: "Thanks all.\r\n\r\nNot to look a gift horse in the mouth, but... ;o)\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm specifically looking for is the full (flat) ad. I believe this would have
    been created by Fallon (though not positive). I remember seeing it in Business
    2.0 and magazines of the like. \r\n\r\neliason: That's pretty damn close and will
    likely make-do barring nothing else. Thanks for finding that!\r\n\r\nChuck: is
    that PDF an actual ad? For some reason, that PDF is corrupt when I download it."
