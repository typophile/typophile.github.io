body: "Hi typophiles,\r\nI'm a humble web designer trying to improve my typography
  skills. At this point I'm particularly concerned with spacing issues. I've read
  several books and at the moment these are the tips I've been able to gather. I'm
  hoping some of you might help me improve, correct or refine this list or point me
  to any relevant literature on the subject. Please excuse me if I get any of the
  terminology wrong. Like I said, I'm a novice. Also, I'm having to write this on
  a tablet so I apologize in advance for any mistakes in the text.\r\n\r\nLetter-spacing\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nReduce
  if:\r\n- large body size (+ adjust kerning)\r\nAugment if:\r\n- small body size\r\n-
  all caps (+ adjust kerning)\r\n\r\nWord-spacing\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTypical
  starting point: 1/4 of body size\r\nIf you are not sure, go with tighter spacing\r\nMust
  be clearly less than line-spacing\r\nMake sure the \"image\" of each word is clearly
  separate from the previous and the next but don't let the lines fall apart. Enforce
  continuity. Step back and see if your paragraphs are disintegrating.\r\nWord-spacing
  can be augmented if:\r\n- typeface has large counters\r\n- you are using an extended
  family\r\n- you are using all caps\r\n- you have long lines\r\n- you have a small
  body size\r\nReduce if:\r\n- large body size\r\n\r\nLine-spacing\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nAugment
  if:\r\n- light text on dark background\r\n- long lines\r\n- large x-height\r\nReduce
  if:\r\n- short burst of info\r\n\r\nLine-length\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nIdeally
  35-65 characters\r\n\r\nJustified text\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nAvoid
  when you have short ines of text.\r\nImprove by:\r\n- splitting words\r\n- adjusting
  word-spacing (make sure uneven spacing doesn't break up your paragraphs)\r\n- adjusting
  letter-spacing (with caution!)\r\n- using dirty tricks (reduce letter width to 97-98-99%)\r\n\r\nLeft-aligned
  text\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nImprove by:\r\n- not
  permitting several equally long or similarly shaped lines go one after the other\r\n-
  not permitting each line to be shorter than the previous one (formng a triangle
  paragrapgh shape)"

  body: "Nice list.\r\n\r\nFirst rule: If it's a good font, trust the type designer
    and don't mess with spacing. How to know if it's a good font? Ask.\r\n\r\nAlso:
    A font is ideal within a pretty tight size range; there is no easy compensation
    for going outside this range.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If you are not sure, go with
    tighter spacing</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is the only thing in your list that strikes
    me as wrong. Overly loose wordspacing can be ugly and wasteful (and slightly slow
    down reading) but overly tight wordspacing can totally ruin reading.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Agree. From what I have read, there is a <strong>huge</strong> gap between
    the two fields. On one extreme there are pseudo-scientific studies conducted by
    typographers with little background in the sciences, and reading studies by scientists
    who don\u2019t know what an x-height is. Truly stunning."

    body size is too general and allows for too much variation.)\r\nNever cheat by
    adjusted letter spacing. (Changes \u2018color\u2019 and is thus unforgivable.)\r\nLimit
    horizontal scaling of glyphs to no more than 2% either way (if too noticeable

    rule: correct \u2018rivers\u2019. If there are too many of those, something is
    wrong with the general settings \u2014 start over."

  body: "The lowercase \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018n\u2019: use either the width of the
    i (especially if it is a serif), or the space between the two stems of the n as
    starting points to define your standard word space.\r\n\r\nA shortcut for using
    the i as a starting point: start with a few lines of text from your publication.
    Copy paste to a second paragraph. In the first copy of the text substitute i\u2019s
    for the space, like this:\r\n\r\nI'mislowlyibeginningitoibuildiailibraryiandiwouldiloveitoigetisomeiadviceitoimakeisureitheifontsiIibuyiareigoodiquality.\r\nI'm
    slowly beginning to build a library and would love to get some advice to make
    sure the fonts I buy are good quality.\r\n\r\nNow play with the wordspace settings
    in the other bit of text to approximate that to the way the first bit looks.\r\n\r\nAs
    you may notice, if you are seeing Georgia (which is a Typophile default), that
    font has word spaces that are equal to the width of the i.\r\n\r\nWorking with
    the inner space of n is a bit more complicated, but with a large zoom percentage
    you\u2019ll get there eventually.\r\n\r\n"
