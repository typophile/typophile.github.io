  body: "Phillip:  Rounder 'G' in your sample (there is no 'g') may be the result
    of a different version of Titling Gothic FB being graphically compressed. There
    are some 50 separate fonts in that family, some of which don't have such a 'straight-sided'
    'G'.\r\n\r\nThe names, as displayed at Myfonts, seem backwards, with Narrow Medium
    \ being much wider than  Compressed Medium, for example.\r\n - Herb"
