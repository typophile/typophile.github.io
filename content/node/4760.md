body: 'Hey, Typophiles -- <BR> <BR>So there I was, working on my new movie &#40;a
  noir thriller, not another &#34;Behind the Typeface&#34;&#41;, fretting over the
  realization that I was going to need to come up with a bunch of names for the credits
  on some movie posters that will appear in the movie. Then it occurred to me that
  there&#39;s this huge bunch of people right in front of me whose names I&#39;d love
  to include, since of course the movie has something to do with typography. <BR>
  <BR>So here&#39;s the deal: respond here or <a href="mailto:cheshire@cheshiredave.com">email
  me</a> with how you&#39;d like your name to appear, and I guarantee your name will
  appear on at least one movie poster. I&#39;ll try to make them as legible as possible,
  though for verisimilitude they&#39;ll have to be in at least an approximation of
  that really condensed style that&#39;s on movie posters everywhere. <BR> <BR>If
  you&#39;d like your credit as having a particular role in a movie, be it actor,
  director, art director, director of photography, screenwriter, etc. &#40;just not
  producer -- that part&#39;s taken care of&#41;, let me know that too, and I&#39;ll
  accommodate you as best I can. Made-up roles are also welcome, though I can&#39;t
  guarantee I&#39;ll use them. <BR> <BR>A few lucky people will also have their names
  above the title, as they will be assigned roles of high-profile actors. &#40;Sorry,
  I can&#39;t offer $20 million plus 20 percent of the back end to my name actors,
  just my undying thanks.&#41; If you would like -- or not like -- to be one of those
  names, let me know. <BR> <BR>Thanks -- hope to see you in my movie!'
