body: "There was a post here a while ago by a member (my apologies, but the name escapes
  me) who had an interesting idea:\r\n\r\nThrow our current Bembo or Centaur into
  Fontlab and apply some vertical and horizontal bold effect in order to fatten up
  these otherwise sad victims of digitization. I tried that with the Cetnaur we have
  now, and it looks and reads much better.\r\n\r\nI applied a 5-horizontal, 5-vertical
  bold effect, nothing else changed. My question is: Even though what I did looks
  good, what would the more experienced users/designers recommend? A little more bold?
  A little less? And finally, is doing this a good idea? It Seems a bit blasphemous,
  but effective all the same. Could this be the solution - all that is needed to \"fix\"
  Centaur, Bembo, and other unfortunates? Or is my inexperience getting the better
  of me?"

  body: The unfortunates would still need to be used at approximately the size of
    the pattern digitised (12 pt for Centaur, 9 pt for Bembo), and bad kernings can
    need repair. I used 2x2 and 3x3 emboldenings for Centaur, but I'm certainly not
    an experienced designer.
