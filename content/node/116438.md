  I was on the website of houseandgarden and found their font so simple and nice to
  work with. However, I could not identify the font on several websites. I am hoping
  one of you knows what font this is!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/interiors/hipster-home-trends/washi-tape\r\n\r\nI
  am not sure if the text \"20 HIPSTER HOME TRENDS WE LOVE\" and the text below the
  image \"The \xA33 magic decorating tape from Japan. If you're a hipster, you use
  it to create your moodboard - you know,  \" are the same... But I want to know :)\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot.\r\n\r\n"
