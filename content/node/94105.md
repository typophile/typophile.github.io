  body: "It will probably be very hard to find topical display fonts with extensive
    open-type features.  They're most often used for posters or advertising or headers
    and such, with little need for alternates or even most punctuation.\r\n\r\nIn
    a paintbrush style, the closest I've seen is Norwegian Cruise Lines' proprietary
    \"Freestyle\" (no longer used), which had some alternates and ligatures. I don't
    believe that they were incorporated as open-type features; for example, an alternate
    't' was in the single dagger position.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "HVB \u2013 I found Freestyle 2.0 samples online, looks more like a hand writing
    (pen) font. In that style, I'm familiar with a few that have open type alternates.
    It's the heavy, chunky, brush style I'm after. Thanks anyway though.\r\n\r\nJosua
    \u2013 I have to populate a 100+ page brochure with text set in this style. Considering
    inevitable edits, revisions, etc, doing by hand would be a huge (and perhaps foolish)
    undertaking. "

    might be a little too sophisticated for your purpose, but it has lots of alternates,
    is brush not pen, and has a pleasant color as a text face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      enough for my intended use.\r\n\r\nFunny, I actually purchased Duffy a couple
      years back for this same client, but never ended up using it. Might have another
      look at it though.\r\n"

    a small sample of the original:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NCLFreestyle_3904.jpg]\r\nThe

    might be a bit too lively for text setting, but depending on how out-there you
    want it too look, could be a good choice. It has plenty of alternates, and start
    and end forms too. Just make sure contextual alternates are on. They don't show
    correctly on the MyFonts testdrive unfortunately but they do work. Honest.\r\nThanks
    for looking,\r\nDave"

    body: 'Dave, great work. Love the lettering style. I was actually looking for
      this font a couple years ago, before it existed. Ended up using Gizmo. Pastiche
      Brush could very well come in handy in the near future. Thanks for sharing. '

    one of my own fonts here and it's actually resulted in a sale. Hope you can find
    a good use for it.
