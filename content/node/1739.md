body: 'Confession: I&#39;m a hinting novice. And I&#39;m trying to make up for lost
  time. My problem is with a very thin slanted font. The stroke weight is about 38
  units per a 1000 unit em.  Here&#39;s a small sample: <a href="http://www.joevanderbos.com/slanted.jpg"
  target="_blank">http://www.joevanderbos.com/slanted.jpg</a> <BR> <BR>Fontlab has
  done a fairly good job with the type 1 hints. I&#39;m not unhappy with the screen
  display &#40;on MacOS&#41; at most sizes I&#39;ve tried.   <BR> <BR>My challenge
  is with true-type hints. In some odd sizes, the stems appear double width, which
  stands out like a sore thumb in a mono-stroked font. My efforts to improve them
  have been spotty at best. I don&#39;t think I make much improvement by addressing
  each troublesome letter individually than I do by just auto-generating them. Is
  there a way to effectively hint diagonals?  <BR> <BR>How important is good hinting?
  Should I just forget it? Should I care about Windows users with lo-res inkjets?
  Do most people who use true-type fonts even know what they&#39;re looking at? Yes,
  this is becoming more of a Dear Abby letter than a query to the techno-smarties
  out there. <BR> <BR>Sorry this is vague and meandering... I&#39;ve been struggling
  with a way to make a coherent query. I&#39;ve read the Manual for fontlab hinting,
  and some of it has sunk in, but perhaps not enough. <BR> <BR>Thanks, Joe'
