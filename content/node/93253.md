body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'm working on an illustration of Joe Strummer's classic telecaster
  guitar, and I'm looking for some help matching a couple fonts. I'm particularly
  interested in the first iteration of the guitar, which is shown in attached photo.
  I don't need exact matches, just something close. I'm looking for 2 fonts: \"IGNORE
  ALIEN ORDERS\" and \"NOISE\" from the attached photo. \r\n\r\nThe \"IGNORE ALIEN
  ORDERS\" has been reproduced and knocked off several times, but it's hard to find
  a high-resolution photo of the original. I'm not sure which of the reproductions
  is correct, if any. Here's a slightly zoomed in version of the attached photo: http://www.axetremecreations.com/productimages/gallery/display/SS-image-2010-10-18-4cbc2ce5bc89d.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    is a typeface simply called \u203AStencil\u2039."
