body: 'All the legal issues guru&#39;s here, could you please advise me on a following
  question: <BR> <BR>I live in a tiny country with it&#39;s own language that has
  several letters in its alphabet that have accented characters which you don&#39;t
  get in a standart font &#40;with macrons, mitigations &#40;is it a term?&#41; et
  al&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So, in order to use a font I have bought from a foundry &#40;assuming
  that it is not one of the few already adapted fonts distributed by our only local
  foundry&#41; I have to open it up in Fontographer, edit the letters - add the missing
  parts and place them in the right places in the character table to work with our
  standard keyboard - and export the font. <BR>  <BR>The question arises when a pal/friend/colleague
  of mine wants to get the same font. What would be the right way to arrange it so
  that he would not have to do the job I&#39;ve already done &#40;ie open-&#62;edit-&#62;export-&#62;use&#41;,
  but still would own the font legally? Is it legal that he buys a copy from the foundry
  and then pays me to edit it and I give him the edited version I already have?'

    licensed copy of the font, however, the best thing you can do is contact the foundry
    directly.

  body: Yeah. We&#39;re all really lawyers.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Maija, like Tiffany
    said it depends on the particular font house, so be sure to ask them&#42;. MS
    is the only one I know of that prevents any modifications for any purpose, but
    most font houses are happy if everybody using the font in any form has paid once
    for it. Some small foundries &#40;like Tankard for example&#41; try to insist
    on doing all modifications themselves, but to me that sort of thing is more of
    a personal decision on your part rather than &#34;professionalism&#34; or something.
    The more you support type designers the better for type in the long term, but
    you have to worry about yourself too. <BR> <BR>&#42; On the other hand, if you
    feel their position is unreasonable &#40;not to yourself, but in the overall&#41;,
    I personally advise taking things into your own hands. That&#39;s how society
    really works, although &#34;officially&#34; they&#39;ll never admit that... <BR>

  body: Hi Maija,  <BR> <BR>Something you may have missed is that you don&#39;t generally
    &#39;buy&#39; fonts, you &#39;license&#39; them. So any rights to modify and further
    distribute the modified font would be documented in the font&#39;s end user license
    agreement &#40;EULA&#41;. <BR> <BR>Most, but not all, font vendors prohibit modification.
    Those that allow modification require that the recipient be a licensee of the
    original font.  <BR> <BR>Finally, do you have a link to an official source that
    lists the requirements for rendering Latvian? <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR>

  body: 'You&#39;re right, Simon - I guess my defence is that I have more interesting
    things to read! On the other hand, a while back MS&#42; was indeed the only one
    to prohibit any mods outright, no? But you&#39;re right, of the first three EULAs
    in that Google result, Bilak&#39;s <i>seems</i> to allow &#34;internal modification&#34;
    &#40;it&#39;s really ambiguous, maybe on purpose&#41;, while the other two don&#39;t.
    I think the latter stance is stupid, because all it does is reduce trust between
    seller and buyer. Telling people they can&#39;t do something they&#39;ll do anyway
    can only serve to reduce your authority. It&#39;s much better to look the other
    way, and follow the other road you mention: &#34;Those that allow modification
    require that the recipient be a licensee of the original font.&#34; And when anybody
    asks me, I&#39;ll advise against buying fonts from such a control-freak font house:
    if you have to go to the original designer for an <i>internal</i> mod on something
    you&#39;ve paid for&#42;&#42;, you&#39;re opening yourself up for delays and extortion.
    And a font house that gains one extra commission by forcing the modification to
    revent to it is losing more than one commission by tricking the customer &#40;with
    an unexpected clause in the EULA&#41; into buying something with hidden fees.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Which you could say was a special case, since OS functionality
    was involved. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; To me the difference between buying and licensing
    is just legalistic trickery. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I have mixed opinions about this. On the one hand, I expect to be able to
    approach a foundry and say &#34;hey, I really need to add East European support
    to one of your fonts I&#39;ve already licensed; you already own all modified versions
    by virtue of their being derivative works, so you can sell my results to a new
    market and claim all resulting profits.&#34; In some cases this may prove a good
    idea; in others, I can see how a foundry would not want to keep track of which
    characters are available in all the third-party-modified fonts that result, to
    say nothing of quality control or phone support in God Knows What Language. Then
    there&#39;s the matter of getting phone calls from service bureaux cos this or
    that third-party version of this or that font is clogging a RIP.  <BR> <BR>Expanded
    character set support is nice to have and will be much easier to implement because
    of things like FontLab and OpenType. But you have to respect the costs that foundries
    have to bear once such modifications are introduced. I would encourage you to
    keep such considerations in mind when approaching a foundry about modifying their
    fonts, and think of ways to make it easier for them. I wish this were simpler,
    but it&#39;s not.

    confused user who doesn&#39;t get that the party responsible for the mods is the
    party who <i>did</i> the mods - i.e. not the original font house. <BR> <BR>In
    the case of MS, most of its users are confused, so the mod prohibition makes more
    sense. <i>However</i>, MS is also rich enough that their [wonderful] type department
    doesn&#39;t have to make money -and of course it doesn&#39;t- to stay alive, and
    MS doesn&#39;t exactly need charity, so in the end it&#39;s essentially Fair to
    [internally] mod their fonts. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    requirements for  <BR>&#62;rendering Latvian? <BR> <BR>I doubt that one exists,
    but I can try and find out. There&#39;s the general thing that we have 11-13 non-standard
    characters in our alphabet &#40;two of them aren&#39;t used anymore and as such
    are optional&#41; and there are some common rules how to create them worked out

    licenses ;-&#41;  <BR>Oops, that&#39;s something I should&#39;ve done in the first
    place. Will have to take a look. <BR>The general part about EULA&#39;s is - if
    you don&#39;t like a clause there but still must have the product - is there an
    option to have that clause removed? Nope, and you have to &#34;license&#34; to
    use the stuff anyway. So no wonder people don&#39;t read them - if they need the
    product, they &#34;Agree&#34; and that&#39;s about it.'

  body: When foundries start paying for the right to license formats I&#39;ll start
    paying attention to the claims they make against modifying fonts I have &#34;licensed&#34;
    from them.  <BR> <BR>Fontographer never got the rights to allow modification of
    certain Microsoft TrueType fonts that contain a certain kind of kerning, since
    they could not provide support for this. One would think that they must have secured
    rights from other major suppliers of formating to allow their own software to
    be used by their customers without concern for liability. So it you modify via
    Fontographer, and I assume FontLab, there must have been certain rights secured
    that circumvent any claims additionally made by piggie-back foundries?
