  body: "I admit it's not exact, but this image was made by manipulating the test
    drive image from FontShop and adding white & black rectangles to modify the E's.
    If I had the actual font I am sure I could have made it closer.\r\n\r\nThis was
    only a suggestion for approximating the lettering.\r\n\r\nAutomobile is also difficult
    to match -- the b seems to be missing a foot serif, the m has more serifs than
    many slab faces, and the e is an odd shape. It's a mystery, even though it looks
    conventional.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheSerifItalECHTEN_6712.gif]"
