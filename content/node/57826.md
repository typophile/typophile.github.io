  designs for books with non-standard diacritics (outside of the open-type pro capabilities),
  can you recommend any text fonts that can support extended diacritics such as under
  dots?\r\n\r\nI found that Adobe Garamond Premier Pro offers some under dot characters,
  but not for the letter \"H,\" which I would definitely need included. \r\n\r\nThank
  you!"
