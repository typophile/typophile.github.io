  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm currently working on a project for uni about the change in society and the existance of class systems in the UK. I've created maps, that are just simple line drawings that have become more intricate as I delved into looking at town layouts from a hundred years ago. (Upper class houses being built on crescents and working class on terraced streets etc.) I've created grids from this map to layout information from the census and at the moment it all looks very plain and straight forward.  <BR>Does anyone have any recommendations as to other information graphic designers that could be useful in helping me kicking start my creativity again?  <BR> <BR>I've tried to look at Edward Tufty books from uni but there always on loan, I've also looked at Jan Tschichold for layout ideas and taken some of his principles. Any help would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Bec</div>

In other words, if it looks plain and straightforward that is probably a good thing, especially combining maps and census information. What is the final objective</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>any recommendations as to other information graphic designers</i> <BR> <BR>You might consider <i>The Semiology of Graphics</i> by Jacques Bertin, translated into English by William J. Berg, Published by University of Wisconsin Press 1983. <BR> <BR>It provides some great theoretical underpinning for determining which kinds of graphical expression to use to express certain kinds of information. Awesome for MAPS with DATA. <BR> <BR><i>&hellip;and at the moment it all looks very plain and straight forward.</i> <BR> <BR>Which is <b>exactly</b> what you want to strive for. Restraint and clarity. Express different things with the smallest amount of perceptible difference. Don't try to go too far. Don't buy into the myth of instantly understood. Especially if the information that you are expressing is is a  complex dependent network of variables. Even those kinds of graphics that we imagine are instantly understood take cognitive skill and time to process, and some kinds of information just require some careful attention no matter what. <BR> <BR>Work-a-day mundane communications are critical tools. In our media saturated western cultures we tend to ignore their importance. It's also easy to worry that our plain and clear graphics will be glossed over or ignored in the visual maelstorm of hype and excess. <BR> <BR>I believe (and it's been my experience) that simple clear statements done with taste and restraint are far more effective than a hypodermic needle full of visual heroin. <BR> <BR>When people need information they <i>always</i> stop on the things that are clear and calm. <BR> <BR>Stay with simple open type for your labelling and legends. Stay with quiet colours and a limited pallette. The map should be a background providing just enough visual cue to locate the data geographically but no more. <BR> <BR>This will hold true no matter the media or presentation context. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Otto Neurath worked in the 20ies and 30ies on information graphics that aimed at social change through education. he wasn't a graphic designer but an economist and worked with Gerd Arntz, a graphic designer. together they developed an astonishing system to show connections between for example living conditions in various districts and infant mortality in a clear and even for illiterate people understandable way. <BR> <BR>at which university do you study? a reasonable part of neuraths archive was given to the reading university - perhaps you could take a look (although i've heard the archive is quite a mess!) <BR>i suppose his work is a must for your topic. <BR> <BR>here is another example, taken from this book: <BR><a href="http://www.neurath.at/pdf/bildersprache.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.neurath.at/pdf/bildersprache.pdf">http://www.neurath.at/pdf/bildersprache.pdf</a></a> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67294.gif" alt=""></div>
