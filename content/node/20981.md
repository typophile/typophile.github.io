  what font it is.\r\n\r\nCould anyone please tell me what font this logo is? \r\n\r\nIs
  the subhead on the logo the same font? It looks like maybe it is, but stretched
  funny.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you know where I can get it for a PC (preferably for free),
  that would be awesome.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\n\r\nKenny"

    it for a PC?

  body: You could substitute <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=B.121677.0.0">Truth</a>,
    which is David Berlow's update of Charcoal, a related Apple font.

  body: Which looks just as crappy, and this isn't David's fault at all. The base
    material is just so poor. I really can't believe so many people use either Techno
    or Charcoal.
