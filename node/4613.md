  at a &#34;late&#34; time one night a week. Does anyone have any comments/suggestions
  for me? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35167.jpg" alt="Late

    logo. Maybe an upscale restaurant. <BR> <BR>The second reminds me of a &#40;good&#41;
    talk-show logo, and I like the typography on #3 but the marque needs revision.
    <BR> <BR>Do you have to use that spelling of &#34;Night&#34;?'

  body: I disagree too. I think the jesus fish in the clock is an excellent concept
    although the logo ends up with the least interesting shape of the three. I think
    being a bit contemporary is good for the young target audience. <BR> <BR>Maybe
    try the dots without the background circle or break that circle up somehow...
    <BR> <BR>The jesus fish reflected moon is aslo a good concept but I agree with
    Chase that it needs a bit of development <BR> <BR>Definitely on the right track...keep
    going! <BR> <BR>s

  body: Thanks for the feedback!   <BR> <BR>The reason I chose the black background
    circle on the first one is because the white on the black resembles night more.  Also,
    without it, the fish looks less &#34;fishy&#34; and more like an X. But I do like
    the shape better and like that the viewer must look more without the circle. I
    don&#39;t know...what do you think? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35199.jpg"

    agree that the third one might need some more development, but I am a little stuck.  Does
    anyone have a suggestions on improving it?

  body: I think the fish is brilliant - much better than a cliche cross would be.
    The thing is, I couldn&#39;t see it until it was mentioned explicitly, but that&#39;s
    probably because I&#39;m not in that mindframe. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s nice to be a
    bit subtle, like I can see people thinking &#34;Oh, now I get it!&#34; about the
    logo <i>after</i> having attended a session - that would give a warm feeling of
    being &#34;in&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    cancer <a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/GI/gi_2.asp">&#34;pink ribbon&#34;</a>
    instead of a fish--it may just be me. It&#39;s the modulated curves that that
    make it look ribbon-like. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve got a great concept going. Have
    you tried incorporating a bible or cross? <BR> <BR>-Addison

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>What about making the crescent moon more &#39;crescent&#39;
    &#40;spans more degrees&#41; and nesting the fish inside its bowl? <BR> <BR>Addison,
    I think it might be more unique not to use a cross/crucifix or bible, since many
    Christian outreach organizations already incorporate those motifs. The fish is
    a bit more subtle.'

  body: Laine, what is the logo being used for? Recruiting new members? Or is it just
    idenity for existing members. I think these questions, being answered, will go
    a long way to how subtle you can make the mark.

    is a fresh approach. My mother is involved with a lot of breast cancer stuff,
    so that ribbon keeps popping up. <BR> <BR>Hmmmm...'

  body: Didn&#39;t Jesus have a talk show on South Park? <BR> <BR>;o&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    saw a ribbon at first, too, but now that I see the fish, i think the last option
    is quite nice. It was hard to see at first, but once I got the moon/fish reflection
    thing it was a really nice, clever, aha! <BR>

  body: I think the reflection could work if it were more clearly defined, like if
    there were a groundline/horizon line between the moon and the fish that doubled
    as a faint underline for the &#34;Late Nite&#34; text.

  body: I think the concept is appropriate. I saw a fish the first time I viewed it.
    However, and it could be that I was saturated at one point with Bodega Sans, but
    I think it looks too 90s.

  body: The dual ribbon like swooshes reminds me of the ribbons affiliated with AIDS
    foundations. At first glance I thought this may be a night time Aids related benefit
    or awareness function.  <BR>Being the heathen/gnostic that I am, it was disappointing
    to realize it was for bible studies.  <BR>Perhaps a worthy consideration?  <BR>
    <BR>Otherwise it is strikingly beautiful and functional. Good job.

    fad was over!   <BR> <BR>the jesus fish doesn&#39;t look like a jesus fish to
    me.  and the condensed typeface doesn&#39;t seem appropriate.  i like the serif
    approach better &#40;on the right&#41;... but that needs way more development.

    the ribbon. <BR> <BR>But the type does not say to me &#34;convesation&#34; &#34;discourse&#34;.
    The current type makes it look like a LATENITE swingers christian club. <BR>=&#41;
    <BR>take care
