  body: "I was hoping someone would spot a match. I didn't.\r\nI wonder if this is
    two different scripts. The lower case seems heavier than the upper case. The _M_
    is a very bad fit for the _ar_, it reads like _Moar_ more than _Mar_.\r\nAs for
    the _C_, it is in the style of Spencerian Script and close versions are found
    in several fonts. For example the _C_ in Ambassador Script CT http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ambassador-script/\r\nor
    in Parfumerie Script Text http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/parfumerie-script-pro/text/
    or in Helinda Rook MT http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/athelinda-rook/\r\n_M_
    and lowercase, also Spencerian variations.\r\nFor a good general substitute to
    your image I like Davison Spencerian HI http://www.houseind.com/fonts/spencerian\r\nDon\r\n"
