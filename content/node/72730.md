    but your sample is much higher contrast.\r\n\r\nHave you looked at fonts by Hubert
    Jocham? He has done some fonts that I think are also similar to your style.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I did look at the Hubert Jocham fonts, at MyFonts, and none were particularly
    close. this could easily be custom work, but it would be nice to know if it is
    something that's available.\r\n\r\nAny one else have an idea?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks Mike for your responses.  I took a look at those too and there is some
    nice stuff form Jocham but I think Phaeton is the closest I've seen!
