  spot different versions of the lower case g (the curly and \"open\" version), different

  body: After a bit of browsing more fonts it seems to just be the difference between
    normal and italic styles. The type preview at H&FJ was a bit confusing, since
    the italics are shown upright instead of in an italic fashion

  body: "<em>What is the idea/purpose behind that?</em>\r\n\r\nIt is to offer different
    \"flavours\" of the same typeface.\r\nThe first occurrence of this dates back
    to the 1930s, when extra \"sorts\" containing single-bowl g's were provided with
    some North American sans faces, to give them a more modern, European look. Similarly,
    Gill Sans was equipped with a single-bowl g by Linotype in Germany in the 1950s.\r\n\r\nToday,
    with OpenType, it is quite easy for foundries to put both single and double-bowl
    \"g\"s in a font, the alternate being accessible in a Stylistic Set. \"a\" is
    another candidate for this duplication: two glyphs for a single character.\r\n\r\nThe
    single bowl a and g were also provided to create \"early reading\" versions of
    some typefaces, Gill and Plantin, for instance.\r\n\r\nHypatia, and my <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/figgins.html\">Figgins
    Sans</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/scotch.html\">Scotch Modern</a>
    types have this feature for \"g\", National for \"a\".\r\n\r\nThere is probably
    a Typophile thread listing all the faces with this duplicity, but I can't find
    it."

  body: "@Nick & Jonathan: thanks so much for the answers and insight! Didn't even
    know about that. Very interesting.\r\n\r\nAt first thought I prefer the single-bowl
    characters. Looks more clean and modern and better fits in what I'm looking for.
    But maybe I have to get used to the double-bowls and look at more examples in
    use. At least I know the words to use in searches now.\r\n\r\nI have no graphic
    design background so I'm learning this on the way, but it's so cool to discover
    how different typefaces have different \"feelings\" to them. Not sure how to describe
    it.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the feedback."

    up question, how do I find out which package I should buy, if I decide to buy
    the Whitney font? Is the only difference between the packages the amount of styles,
    or are there also certain differences in characters included?\r\n\r\nNormally
    at font shops you can download a pdf with the font specifics, all the characters
    included, etc. Even though it's an expensive font, I'd be happy to pay for it
    if I'm sure what to get"

  body: "A binocular g is used to sell more fonts. Even though a monocular g might
    be easier to read and appear more balanced, a font designer can get more attention
    by including a cute binocular g. If an alternate g is not included, the font buyer
    may become leery of the font designer's ability to make both types of g. Font
    buyers can become nervous or run away if they don't see a binocular g. The smart
    font designer always includes a binocular g to ensure steady font sales.\r\n\r\nSome
    fonts have no remarkable marketable features: adding a cute binocular g to a boring
    can add up to big bucks. A fancy R, curly lowercase l or ampersand can also be
    used to sell more fonts, but nothing beats the incredible marketing power of the
    binocular g."

    a t-shirt. While a binocular g may be suited to retro themed fonts they often
    look out-of-place in fonts with more of a contemporary, minimalist theme.\r\n\r\nIf
    the intention of the binocular g is to make a font easier to read then why do
    font designers endeavor to make them so quirky and unique when the rest of the
    font is so staid?\r\n\r\nIt was a clich\xE9 of the last decade and a half: serious
    modular corporate fonts with little personality that feature a quirky binocular
    g to help differentiate them from other modular corporate fonts with little personality.\r\n\r\nGo
    to MyFonts.com and search for contemporary sans. Change the sample text to goggles
    and you can find many examples."

    great thing now with OpenType is that a foundry can design a Neutral, Friendly-Yet-Authoritative,

    will never be used by art directors for their Boring-Yet-Profitable corporate
    clients, but which adds memorability to the product. Like 4WD for commuters.\r\n\r\n"
