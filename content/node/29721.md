  body: "Another interesting case is Mrs Eaves:\r\n\r\n<cite>This typeface is named
    after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville\u2019s wife. As Baskerville
    was setting up his printing and type business, Mrs. Eaves moved in with him as
    a live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his wife after the death of her first
    husband, Mr. Eaves. Like the widows of Caslon, Bodoni, and the daughters of Fournier,
    Sarah similarly completed the printing of the unfinished volumes that John Baskerville
    left upon his death.</cite> (from http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves/)"
