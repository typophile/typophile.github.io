  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody <BR> <BR>this is about a poster for a small theater in town and is the poster i mention to the General Discussions board at the &quot;S/M Typeface Wanted&quot; string.  <BR> <BR>The story: the tragic documentation of  a stong and deadly passion among 3 persons: a couple and the best girl-frient of the woman. Love and hate is total and exist at the same time. Violence is both physical and phsycological. There is no logic and ethics, only the power of passion which in the end leads to the death. <BR> <BR>There is no real story that i can describe, since the play is based more on the emotions of the scenes than their plot. <BR> <BR>The poster: A and B are the first approaches. They chose B and so we moved to F1,2,3 expecting to select the final. I am sorry that i posted the work so late, but everything happened very fast. Actually i posted the work because one week ago i asked for appropriate font to the theme (&quot;S/M Typeface Wanted&quot; in General Discussions board). <BR> <BR>Eventually being ispired from what everybody kindly send i designed the lettering for the title (as you see it needs hell a lot of work) but i couldn't make it work with the poster. <BR> <BR>Have a nice day, christos <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51773.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sweet, I think the font is ideal and the directions are accurate to your description! <BR>I am partial to F1, however, I feel like the incorporation of the man/woman bathroom icons isn't successful from the cardboard concept. Their basic rounded forms feel foreign to the harsh angles and intense imagery, and the font, too. My suggestion would be to try redrawing these characters, make fit. (though this message may just be too late!) <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>aaron</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Aaron  <BR> <BR>i understand your objection but i disagree. I like the differentiation between the elements and i believe it works in this sceptic: this process of destruction leaded by the passion can take any &quot;ordinary&quot; person and make him/her go to the edges. Also the story starts very &quot;normal&quot; to end up in &quot;flames&quot; of sensuality and death.  <BR> <BR>I don't agree to make the figures &quot;more fit&quot; because i think then their presence would be useless. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the feedback <BR> <BR>christos</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How important do you feel the gun is to the poster Christos? <BR>(Maybe a stupid question) I don't see it as a necessary element. <BR> <BR>For whatever reason, F3 reminded me of a negative from a  <BR>camera that has been dangerously spliced apart, and from there  <BR>I thought of voyeurism. The contrast of the white and the blood  <BR>red is also more appealing to me. Can you use the word  <BR>appealing in the context? <BR> <BR>You really need to pics that aren't so wide. Don't mind  <BR>scrolling down forever, but reading loooonnnggg lines of text <BR>is a little bit of a pain. :^)</div>
