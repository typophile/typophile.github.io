  body: "Reminds me of [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0131|Thinaire]],
    but they\u2019re not similar in construction \u2014 only thin, narrow and wobbly.
    Also in the same vein: [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0485|Annike]],
    [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0235|Hannah]] and [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0324|Strangelove]]."
