  been released by Greater Albion and is being offered at 30% introductory discount
  on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/mexborough/ | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\nMexborough
  owes its origins to a challenge from a client of ours- they wanted a clear and easily
  readable typeface to use for signage in public spaces, but with enough flair and
  style to be suitable for use in heritage precincts. The result is a family of six
  Roman faces in a single weight, encompassing Regular, Text, Flamboyant, Small Capitals,
  Capitals and Title forms. These faces combine legibilty with traditional character,
  ideal for signage and poster work, where dignity and character are required. Mexborough\u2019s
  simple clean lines also lend themselves readily to web and online use.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mexborough_Gallery2_6481.png]\r\n\r\nWe
  also managed a certain amount of press coverage for this release-in the South Yorkshire
  Times, based in...you guessed it...Mexborough in South Yorkshire:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mexborough_Gallery3_5390.png]"
