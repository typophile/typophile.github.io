body: "I'm creating some reports containing mostly tables with a lot of columns.  So,
  the text tends to be very small (7-10 points).  I'm looking for a sans-serif typeface
  that looks very readable at those small sizes and within tables.  It has to come
  in TTF, which the reporting tool requires.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about typefaces
  like DIN, Meta Condensed, Milo Sans, and the like.  We'll be using Milo Sans and
  Serif for other reports, so I'm leaning towards that, but it's ashame Milo doesn't
  come in a condensed form.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: "Hey there!\r\n\r\nTake a look at <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/amplitude/\">Amplitude</a>,
    its a very versatile family with a condensed version that will fit your needs.
    Also, I've recently discovered <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/klint-lt-pro/\">Klint
    LT Pro</a>, another big family of fonts. They are both, however, more on the technical
    side as far as look and feel. If you want a more neutral typeface thats just as
    contemporary, go for <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/prelo-condensed/\">Prelo
    Condensed</a>.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"

    is a very nice find, too.  It's neutral but still very easy on the eyes.  Thank
    you."
