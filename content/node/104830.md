    a quite complete alphabet without knowing the name... What's the sample's origin?"

  body: Thanks for the reply and the suggestions, Ryuk. I'm using artwork that was
    supplied by an agency and the type was all outlined. I think it's a custom design
    they've made up for the concept. Thanks again.
