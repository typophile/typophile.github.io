  body: 'In Photoshop, use Futura Book at 72 point or so. Working in grayscale, apply
    a Gaussian blur with a radius of 4 pixels or so, then adjust the levels so your
    type is almost pure black and white (this will wiggle the outlines). Then apply
    an outer glow: select black at the color, 8 pixels or so as the size, and "dissolve"
    as the blending option. Crank the opacity down to 10% or less, and you''ll have
    a weak halo of suitable schmutz.'

    have one suggestion... crudely remake it by hand then digitize it.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    i just can't stop the sarcasm sometimes."

    body: Yeah, I hear you. Making it by hand would be one way of doing it, but I
      was hoping there was  digital version of an old letterpress font. There's a
      lot of small irregularities that only the print process can make.
