  would.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n"

  body: Great news. Nice to see the W3C standard supports petite caps. Maybe Word
    2016 and Adobe CS9 would do the same.

  body: Si, to clarify, is this IE support using the working draft CSS3 syntax to
    which you linked, or the 'moz' syntax that Mozilla implemented to support OTL
    while awaiting publication of the CSS3 standard?

    that web developers won\u2019t like this that much \u2026\r\n\r\nI think it's
    standard practice to align with the most recent version of a W3C working draft.
    FireFox implemented support quite a while ago, hence the earlier syntax. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    once the standardization process is complete there will be no need to use the
    prefixes (ms or moz) and browsers will be expected to support the final syntax,
    which will likely match IE's implementation."
