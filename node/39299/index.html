<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone have any links or recommendations on indepth analysis of the fonts of Neville Brody? There is alot out there about his use of type but I am looking for analysis of his type designs (the inspirations, methods of production, indepth look at particular letterforms, etc). I have his two monographs and have trawled the font bureau websites already...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is Industria also informed by constructivism?
Soviet modernism in London in the mid '80s.
Gorbachev, perestroika, and after the punk rock revolution.
Something of the political synechdote in the constructedness of Brody's faces?

<div class=commentbody>"Is Industria also informed by constructivism?...
Having been at a couple of his presentations and talked to him afterwards, it seemed that Nevile Brody rather overtly identified with the political zeitgeist of the 70s and 80s. I'd be surprised if constructivism weren't an influence for Industria as well as some of his other faces. For a designer of his profile, it is surprising that there aren't that many good studies online.
"Gorbachev, perestroika..."
I'm not so aware of the particular influences of these on graphic design. Nick, I'd be grateful for any elaboration. </div>

<div class=commentbody>The Soviet Union was opening up and in the news, provoking interest in things Russian. Constructivism was seen to represent an attractive formalism for the anti-Thatcher counterculture, superceding the revolutionary chaos of punk.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks. Would you recall any notable example in graphic design that came out of this influence?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Insignia and Industria were done before FB got involved, but FF Blur, FF Typeface 6 and 7, FF World, FF Gothic, FF Tokyo, FF Typeface 4, and FF Pop were all developed with inspiration from logos and simple display faces made for NB's clients. Methods of production were standard for this kind of work, with Brody providing T. Frere-Jones and myself with the existing work, we grew the glyph set to standard, separated various ideas engulfed in the designs into styles and weights that others could use, and bounced particular letterforms across the sea. What started as 4-5 styles, ended with 10-12. Later, when all the main tasks were done, TFJ and I went to Berlin, finalized most of the details with NB and then the works were manufactured at FF and released. Blur was slightly different, with TFJ working on that with NB solo, mostly to establish some spacing that worked.
I have not seen the monographs, what do they say?
Cheers!

<div class=commentbody>The book <a href=http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-17-6><em>Unjustified texts</em></a> has an essay on Neville Brody which you might find interesting. Kinross also critiques Brody's early faces in <a href=http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-18-3><em>Modern typography</em></a> (2nd edition). You should also check out a book called <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/site/catalog/index.php?main_page=pubs_product_book_info&products_id=3407&store=books"><em>ABZ</em></a> (currently out of print) for constructivist faces that may have been an inspiration for Industria.</div>
