body: Hello, I have to redesign a restaurant&#39;s logo for an assignment, and I would
  love to get some feedback.  <BR> <BR>The restaurant I chose offers fine dining as
  well as a more casual cafe in the front &#40;although you can dress pretty casually
  in either part of the restuarant&#41;. It serves contemporary French cuisine, and
  the decor is very art nouveau, saying that the main restaurant is set in a turn-of-the-century,
  restored ballroom. Since the space is so &#34;grand&#34; and the gorgeous chandeliers
  inside left a lasting impression with me, I wanted to incoroprate the grandness
  of the space, its art nouveau roots and of course the chandeliers. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  done many versions, but this is the direction my teacher liked best. I&#39;m not
  exactly crazy about it &#40;I think it may be a little too bulky and unversitle&#41;,
  but the other solutions I had didn&#39;t seem &#34;grand&#34; enough. <BR> <BR>Please
  let me know what you think! Some good, constructive feedback would be wonderful!

    Just go back one page and go to topics and you will see your name posted as the
    last post. It works. <BR> <BR>I kind of like the first one. Especially if they
    made it a backlit sign

  body: Do you have photos of the chandelier? The illustration seems a little off,
    particularly the perspective of the bottom part.  <BR> <BR>Also  the size of the
    chandelier is overwhelming your logo. I know you want to express the grandness
    of the space, but I do not get an impression of the space nor the size of the
    chandelier. Maybe if you juxaposed it with another object in the room &#40;without
    adding too much clutter&#41; you could get a better relational idea of the space.
    Or even cropping the illustration asymetrically might give some interesting white
    space.

  body: Haha, thanks Daniel. <BR> <BR>Here is a photo of the restaurant along with
    some of the other directions I had worked on. <BR> <BR>Michael, I eliminated some
    of the shapes at the botom of the illustration -- does that solve the perspective
    problem? I also included what I&#39;m planning to do for the front of my business
    card. Is this what you&#39;re talking about as far as cropping the illustration?
    <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52766.jpg"

  body: 'Sara: <BR> <BR>I like the direction you are taking with the bizcard. It might
    make sense to take that direction with the logo itself, meaning use the logotype
    as &#34;the logo&#34; and use the chandelier liberally as a supporting graphic
    element. <BR> <BR>Have you tried reversing the positive/negative treatment? In
    other words, have you tried making the chandelier a lighter color and the negative
    space the darker color? I ask because my first impression of the graphic was that
    it was an upside down 3-layered chocolate cake &#40;which made me hungry&#41;.
    When I saw the photos in your last post, I thought that the graphic might resemble
    the chandelier better if it were reversed'

  body: I somehow find the borders in the squares distracting. they take away the
    emphasis from both the type and mark. I&#39;m not crazy about the green either.
    from the picture you posted, the rich, warm, colors are wonderfool, and the green
    seems to cool it off, how about trying a warmer shade?

    chandelier lighter than the background it no longer looks that edible. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: all looks good, but i also liked 3# the most. it really got the bestest color
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
    <BR>i think that the letterspacing works better there then in 1#-2#, but maybe
    you can really try and find something else? anyway it&#39;s better then the rest.
    <BR>i also liked 6#, but it miss the whole &#34;grand&#34; feeling that i think
    works.

  body: 'Another vote for #3, though you can maybe try making the chandelier a bit
    smaller? i think the type needs some more breathing room. The colors are great,
    give the same sense of atmosphere as the photo. Also agree that the type layout
    from #2 seems more balanced.'

  body: I don&#39;t think you can easily see that this is a chandelier.  <BR> <BR>I
    like your number nine best &#40;some posts ago&#41;. Perhaps you could give these
    &#34;cakes&#34; some connection. If they are separated they are hard to spot as
    a chandelier. &#40;In my first post I thought about three differnt ligths in the
    caf

  body: Something that might help to more easily identify the chandelier is adding
    the support rod on top. If you do try that, you might also try moving Grand Cafe
    above the chandelier. These two changes would create a sense of hanging, which
    should help to make the chandelier more obvious. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'I like the abstracted chandelier shapes, but right now they are also evoking
    other imagery: cakes, orange sections, wheels, etc.  <BR>The image is so abstract,
    people might not see it. It&#39;s an interesting shape, but I doubt anyone but
    us would make recognize it as a chandelier.  <BR> <BR>I also like #3 as a card,
    but not as a logo. I made a quick rough for the card and added a smaller chandelier
    for perspective; tring to give a sense of space. I also adjusted the bottom parts
    of the chandelier that I mentioned was &#34;kind of off&#34; in my previous post.
