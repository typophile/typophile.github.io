  the various mailinglist archives. I would love to hear if I got the technical parts
  correct, and if there are any new developments in this area. I tried to write this
  for my fellow web devs, so I might've made some mistakes on the tech side of fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pixelambacht.nl/2014/multicolor-fonts/\r\n\r\n"
