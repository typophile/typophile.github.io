body: "So as I've been writing wiki entries over the past few days, more than once
  I've found myself consulting wikipedia.org. I am in awe of the Wikipedia. Somehow
  they have created a community that with a diverse yet consistent voice. The information
  presented is almost always relevant and just enough to get started into any subject.
  The authors, for the most part seem to understand their audience, who for the most
  part are not specialists. They are most likely a member of the general public, looking
  to gain a basic understanding of a topic. Wiki authors understand this concept of
  a broad audience partly because of wikipedia's encyclopedia metaphor.\r\n\r\nNeedless
  to say, I'm particularly interested in the articles relating to type design. Unfortunately,
  there is a lot of work to be done there. I've jumped in a couple of times to add
  to the mix, but I could admittedly do more to expand both mine and the public's
  understanding of type design.\r\n\r\nSo why should there be a specialized TypoWiki?
  The thought occurred to me as I was writing a few paragraphs on the [[Python]] language
  in the TypoWiki. Wikipedia's article was very complete with additional articles
  on Guido van Rossum and other similar languages. It occurred to me, though, that
  there were important parts missing. Like, for example, that Python is the primary
  scripting language of [[FontLab]] or that [[RoboFab]] is written in Python (as well
  as a couple other wonderful tools from [[LettError]]). It then occurred to me that
  it would be completely inappropriate to mention RoboFab in the Python article on
  Wikipedia (though it should probably have it's own entry). If one were to list every
  piece of software written in Python on the Wikipedia page, it would be enormous,
  and probably not that useful. What do I care if some agronomical engineer in Iowa
  wrote a corn calculator in Python?\r\n\r\nHowever, Python's FontLab connection is
  very important to type designers. It's question of audience. Type designers need
  a different, though related set of information about type design. They need a more
  specialized set of information. Articles in the TypoWiki should assume that the
  reader has more interest in, if not more knowledge about type design than the general
  reader of the Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nSo now I'm more convinced of the value of the TypoWiki.
  It's not competing with the Wikipedia, it's providing a venue for a more specialized
  audience. Already there are a lot of great articles in the TypoWiki. I'm excited
  to see what happens. I'm excited for edit wars. I'm excited for heated discussion
  around type controversies. What is a [[bouma]] anyway?"

    general situation with <strong>any</strong> field Wikipedia tries to represent?\r\n\r\n>
    What is a bouma anyway?\r\n\r\nSure as hell ain't a word shape. Why am I not going
    in and \"fixing\" that? Because there already was a Bouma entry before, which
    Forrest started and I edited - but now it's gone... Plus it sounds like many people
    are having general access issues. So maybe make the thing robust first? That said,
    I agree, the potential is super. Like look at Raph's \"Optical Scaling\" entry
    - very nice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It's filling up with garbage, fast, and there's no one to clean up. This is
    common with all x-pedias but with the preponderance of blowhards in and around
    this industry, the crisis stage has already been reached and soon the swamp will
    only be worth venturing into if you're desparate, or bored, in my humble opinion.

  body: "\"why do you feel that way, david?\" \r\n\r\nWell...here's a example of a
    short definition, and my analysis of it as an example:\r\n\r\n\"TrueType is a
    type rendering technology created by Apple to compete with Adobe\u2019s PostScript
    based Type 1 fonts. TrueType differs from Type 1 in that it uses quadratic as
    opposed to cubic bezier curves. TrueType excels at on screen rendering with sophisticated
    hinting allowing for customized bitmaps at a variety of sizes. TrueType rendering
    technologies have found their way into new OpenType standards.\"\r\n\r\n>TrueType
    is a type rendering technology\r\nNo. There is a tt rasterizer but TT is not a
    rendering technology. It is a type technology, but since that has not been defined,
    i.e. what constitutes a type technology, either in the -pedia or in the authors
    definition, it's easy to understand nothing :)\r\n\r\n>created by Apple to compete
    with Adobe\u2019s PostScript based Type 1 fonts. \r\nThat may have been the effect,
    but it was definitely not the cause!\r\n\r\n> TrueType differs from Type 1 in
    that it uses quadratic as opposed to cubic bezier curves.\r\nTrue, but so what?
    What's the difference between the two?\r\n\r\n> TrueType excels at on screen rendering
    \r\nGrammar no count?  \r\n\r\n>with sophisticated hinting allowing for customized
    bitmaps at a variety of sizes.\r\nOkay, so where is the \"custom bitmap\" utility?
    and besides that, how many TT fonts have ever had customized bitmaps in them?
    The point being that \"customized bitmaps\" is a wholly different thing than \"sophisticated
    hinting allowing for bitmaps of the highest possible quality, at all sizes\",
    no variety involved.\r\n\r\n>TrueType rendering technologies have found their
    way into new OpenType standards.\r\nThis is mis or dis information. Seeing as
    the rendering technology is not the point, or the definition of TT, so it couldn't
    be plural. If one bothered to create a generic definition of \"type technology\",
    one'd see the opposite is actually true of the back end of the sentence, namely,
    that the contours, hints, 90% of the tables, kerning and composite technologies
    of OT are all 99.99% pure Apple TT, and but 1.01% was added to become OT. Right!?\r\n\r\nSo,
    I don't mean to pick on one thing or an author, but making -pedias that spread
    this erroneous information is in my opinion much, much worse than no -pedia at
    all.\r\n\r\nHistory though usually written by the winners, is always edited by
    someone. Magazines have em! Newspapers have 'em. Books have 'em. Even the little
    bios in our font database has an editor who looks at the stuff, checks spelling
    grammar, facts, opinions, and makes suggestion to/demands of the author. Somewhere
    in the history of reporting on internet innovations, someone thought an unedited
    database of definitions would be a great idea. They were, in my opinion, wrong.
    Let's not let our knowledge become trivialized by laziness. \r\n\r\nI have to
    go take a Wikipedia, and then get on to work, but I look forward to what others
    think, (I at least am easily editable ;)\r\n"

  body: "Ah, the drama. This is what it's all about. It's true that when you read
    a wiki, you have to take it with a grain of salt. That being said, I happen to
    know that 'editorial' content can be a little wobbly itself, but who can correct
    it? Of course, the TrueType article you pointed out has been tweaked since you
    wrote about it. Thanks for the feedback :)\r\n\r\nOf course, there is always the
    possibility that someone could correct the wiki incorrectly, but that being said,
    the real power of the wiki is in the edit history, which is yet to be exposed
    in our case, but it's there. Different viewpoints on controversial topics are
    quickly exposed as edits are made. If you look closely, you will be able to figure
    out which authors/edits can be trusted. If nothing else, you know what the different
    viewpoints are, and can make up your own mind. Equally valuable is the discussion
    surrounding the article.\r\n\r\nThe death of a wiki is a lack of passion from
    it's audience (or lack of audience alltogether). Then there truly is \"no one
    to clean up\". Fortunately, there is no lack of passion in this community, and
    plenty of people who are either desperate or bored. :)\r\n\r\n>True, but so what?
    What\u2019s the difference between the two?\r\n\r\nClick on the wiki links :)"

    open to such linking or integration, but I have no idea about the Typowiki. Simply
    declaring that all content in the Typowiki is licensed under the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License\">GFDL</a>
    would solve the problem. Is that a practical step? Or do we really want to maintain
    a barrier so that text cannot flow freely between the two wikis?"
