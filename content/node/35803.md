  similar. \r\n\r\nSecondly - is there anything in the typical MS Word suite that
  duplicates it? (or approxiamates it?)\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank

  body: "Many thanks Robert.  Looking at some of those old newspapers brings back
    good memories, and the type style used is certainly a big part of it.\r\n\r\n-From
    someone who quite candidly knows next to nothing about type styles.....but I like
    to think I can appreciate the artistic expression involved.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n"
