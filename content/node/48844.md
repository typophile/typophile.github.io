body: "Hi Typophilian mates!\r\n\r\nWell I love try to design some fontface cuz I'm
  just a begginer on this discipline, in fact, my start is this year and my previuos
  experience is on Calligrhy.\r\nI come to tell to all of you that this is my first
  full character set designed and I would like take your opinion and critiques about
  this work and so you can help me to improve it, please.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"Farola\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  uppercases Farola are very decorative then its lowercases are most regular for keep
  a little of equilibrium.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/farola-typophile1_6004.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is a Display font is done to be used on big sizes, titles or logos.\r\nhere an example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/farola-typophile2_5344.png]\r\n\r\nRespects
  and Regards\r\nPedro [<strong>PeGGO</strong>]"

  body: This is a real delight, Pedro. It gives me a '60s-'70s latin resort feeling
    and has a definite hand rendered charm. I adore the caps, but I recommend a simpler
    set as alternatives. I know it's meant for larger settings, but it can work for
    short text too if you improve the spacing, especially to the right of the 'a'
    and around the 'i' and 'o'. This will sacrifice your connections a bit, but it's
    worth it.

    coming from you..!!!\r\nI get some Capital alternatives drawed but it's hard ever..
    .. some friends also tell me about some spacing pairs.. I believe that need a
    deep and slow check.. for reach a work more accurate.\r\nthan you mate..!!\r\n=)\r\nPedro"

  body: "Beautiful work.\r\n\r\nYour ch and ck ligatures are a little too crowded.
    Open them up so that the c has as much room as the unligated one we see in \"Acholias\".\r\n\r\nYou
    may find it wise to create Ni And Mi ligatures.\r\n\r\nThe decorated tails of
    R and K force a very large gap in all settings with lowercase. Perhaps they should
    descend?"

    beautiful gesture, it's so encourage, believe me. I'm fun so much when I'm design
    it, although is a hard work.. is too funny work and deserve the better efforts..!!
    :D\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Cerulean:</strong></li>\r\n\r\nI'm agree with your suggestions
    about Ligatures, then I tried to make that 'Mi', 'Ni' and another so similar 'Hi':\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Farola_NEWLIGA-text_5254.png]\r\n\r\nAfter
    every new ligature added I think about one thing: \r\nthat mean a new hard work
    cuz if our design has an irregular Metric (like Farola) mean several check out
    for every new gliph added (ligatures), and by the way so several aditional kerning
    pairs are need be checked too, is necessary had work and anyway I love make this
    irregular design.\r\n\r\nI also tried that descent tails for K and R (and may
    be L need same work)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Farola_NEW_R-and-K_6227.png]\r\n\r\nthank
    you for your words and all useful mate words, I always appreciate good suggestions

    redrew some new alternates gliphs of FAROLA font, remind me everything could be
    improve still better like current state. Some peoples told me same like you about
    spacing for this font and I think this could be improve with a little looser spacing..
    this kind of specific spacing was so cause to touching forms between gliphs, like
    a visual game and in fact could be changed after by each program but of course
    I figure it out that you talk about of some details that really need an more accurate
    review.. I'll keep the plan in mind, no doubt."

    which is more texty but has similar twiddles. I think what I've learnt here is
    to have two sets of caps, that works well I think.
