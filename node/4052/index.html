		<div class="commentbody">I think it makes very much sense for a kid&#39;s book. It conveys a human aspect making courier feel a little friendlier and more expression. Plus, the kids don&#39;t have to read complicated script shapes! &#40;especially if they don&#39;t know how to write them&#41; It was probably conscious in some way though I agree with you there&#39;s a paradox there.. especially courier! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Might it have been a way for people with imperfect lettering skills &#40;probably 90% of us...&#41; to save money on typesetting? I think at the very least the difficulty of getting good setting for cheap was a catalyst for giving it such a &#34;hand-made-font&#34; look. Saving money and creativity often go hand-in-hand. Frankling was wrong: it&#39;s not necessity that&#39;s the mother of invention, it&#39;s laziness! And greed is its father. <BR> <BR>One interesting thing in my sample above is that Courier&#39;s bad spacing &#40;being a monospaced font&#41; has been reproduced exactly! It seems like the author used tracing paper directly over laserprinted settings of Courier... In the 70s, maybe they used font specimen books that way? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, in the 70s we used to comp headlines for rough layouts by tracing over specimen books. The layout paper pads were not tracing paper, but high-quality rag paper, with enough transparency to do this &#40;or trace over one&#39;s previous sketches, or a photocopy blow-up, whatever&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, back then, &#34;the preposterous google&#34; represents a &#34;rough layout&#34; look that was being used as finished artwork. &#40;After all, illustrators would have been familiar with receiving &#34;tight comp&#34; layouts with this kind of lettering, from art directors, for positioning their illustrations.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Now, the traced Courier appears to be about humanizing technology, and also represents the present-day myth that stuff for kids should look crudely formed, like they did it.  <BR> <BR>That is really &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; stupid, IMHO -- not the way to educate children at all. Just because kids can&#39;t do sophisticated handwriting, doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t appreciate or understand it. Besides, Adults can&#39;t write any better either! <BR> <BR>Sure, Dr Seuss had wacky wonky lettering on his book covers, but it was beautifully drawn &#40;unlike the recent travesty of his lettering in the Myers movie which was carried over into his re-released books&#41;, and inside his books the youngsters got Garamond and Century. No wonder boomers are so much smarter than subsequent generations -- we grew up reading decent typography!</div>
