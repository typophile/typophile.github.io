  serif font. The \"CONSTRUCTION\" looks like it's been artificially italicized, but
  it's hard to tell.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trace_5499.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"

    days when they were independent. I have the font on one of their old Letterpress
    CDs. I think there are sites you can find it on the web too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
