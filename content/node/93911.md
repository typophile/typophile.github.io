  use to have a gateway netbook that had this font on it. I created a website using
  this font and now that my gateway netbook has crashed I can't seem to find what
  font it is.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks."

    instead of inch and foot marks which often are.\r\nI guess it is just the preference
    of the type house?\r\nOption/shift/] is the mac access for the single quote/apostrophe.\r\nOr
    you could use a comma with minus lead."
