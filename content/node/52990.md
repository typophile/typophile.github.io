  body: I would never have read that as MUCHO. I am also guessing (unless you have
    evidence to the contrary) that it was created by hand. There are inconsistencies
    to the curves that I think would have been fixed in a commercial font. The U is
    not symmetrical for example.

  body: "Usually these things are custom. I have done some bold-style type like this,
    and those were all custom. \r\n\r\nThe example you post is also rather poorly
    executed, in my opinion."

    the lettering for \"MUCHO\" is slightly different than what you've posted here.\r\n\r\n[EDIT]
    I did some more digging with Google, and found a <a href=\"http://www.colectivobi-cicleta.blogspot.com/2008/06/mucho-lo-nuevo-de-babasonicos-y-el-arte.html\">Colombian
    design blog</a> that says the album cover design is by <a href=\"http://www.siscottstudio.com/\">Si
    Scott</a>...\r\n\r\nSo I would say that this is a custom lettering-and-illustration
    job."
