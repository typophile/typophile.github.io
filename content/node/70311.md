  I am currently redesigning The Communist Manifesto for my final book design class.
  \r\n\r\nAppreciate any help. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/postermai68_3559.jpg]"

    spirit of the thing.\r\nWhy not step outside your soft bourgeois existence and
    do some real work with the crude tools of the proletariat?"

  body: "Whatever you're going to do, keep in mind that designing a version of the
    Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) in the style of the French May (1968)
    is something that bears at least two different strong cultural references.\r\nIt
    would be like designing, for example, a Seventies version of The Picture of Dorian
    Gray."

  body: "@Nick: Probably will try that. Great post, made me smile :D\r\n@riccard0:
    I made classic, 19 century oriented book, but my mentor ditched it and put me
    in this direction. I am not going just after French May, I am going for lo-fi
    communist or any kind of protest, propaganda or other kind material. \r\n\r\nOther
    input needed for this book is that this class is called Graphic Technology, so
    accent is on \"alternative\" and \"creative\" ways of final production(emphasis
    is on production): bindings, papers, colors, formats, print and so on.  "

  body: "Nick, your comment made me laugh. \r\n\r\nIt also made me wonder how a 30-year-old
    Karl Marx would publish his manifesto today. Release it in single chapters as
    part of his blog, with notices of updates posted on Facebook? Self-publish it
    on Lulu.com? Promote it with a (hopefully) viral YouTube video, links to which
    would be retweeted by his sympathizers?"
