body: "Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logo revision for a company called \"Urgent
  Career\". Basically they offer a service that entails phone based interviews. I'm
  attaching their original concept, along with my revised one.\r\n\r\nBasically I'm
  trying to clean things up and simplify the concept. I decided to take the bars (phone
  signal strength obviously) and titled it to create the arrow\u2014which reinforces
  the word \"URGENT\". \"URGENT\" is also used for the base of the arrow. I set \"CAREER\"
  in black because I really wanted it to stand out. I kept reading their company name
  as \"Urgent Care\" and really wanted people to realized the difference.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIONAL\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/urgentCareerOrig_4416.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISED\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/urgentCareer_4560.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    absent in the new one.\r\nI also think its the ratio (about 1/20) is a bit long.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe
    new one is much nicer anyhow...\r\n"

  body: "The tilted bars read like tilted bars to me and I find it distracting.\r\n\r\nThe
    relative simplicity of the new one is better - but I think it needs to keep going
    and to get a core graphic idea/hook other than bars/phone.\r\n\r\nWhat about that
    word urgent?"

    more than the old one, though. To be honest, I didn't understand the phone signal
    bit at all."

  body: I would move Career to the left by taking off 2 thirds of the space, closer
    to the 'wing'. If you want to consider replace the bars (at and t) try using a
    triangle or various forming another wing.

  body: "I won't comment much on the arrow/bars (other than that I do like the subtle
    \"corporate ladder\" reference). However, I feel like if I were climbing those
    stairs, I would fall backwards - which is not something that I'd like for my career.\r\n\r\nBut
    I will say good job getting rid of the reflection and orange/blue color scheme.
    I really like your new version. It is clean and professional, yet comfortable
    and approachable, especially on the manilla-envelope-colored background."

  body: "I like the new one. I would ditch the phone bars though as they only work
    as an arrow to emphasize the urgent bit. I agree with everyone else's comments
    above for the most part.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could keep that same basic arrow shape
    but make it into a flip-top cell phone. That would make the telephone idea stronger."

  body: Great improvement. I think you got the phone reference right on, at least
    to me. I wouldn't worry about it resembling the AT&T campaign or Adidas. I think
    if it was seen with it's supporting collateral/website that might help it's purpose.
    Letter spacing might need some attention though. Anyway, I like it.

    haha\r\n\r\nNo, what I do see is a right-facing arrow, which I love.  It's like
    the hidden arrow in the counter between the Ex in FedEx, genius!\r\n\r\nif anything,
    I'd love to see that arrow worked in more!"

    revolted!  I am deeply jealous of you.\r\n\r\nI think this design works well,
    although I think that the cell phone bars are not immediately apparent.  I would
    like to see the spacing worked on, however.  It seems like the arrow is too close
    to \"URGENT.\"  Also, I would like to see it in black against a white background.
