body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've created a font that has 3 character variations using
  calt (which works fine) and includes a set of 3 swash variations per character as
  well. The issue I'm having is I also want to include start and end swashes for select
  letters (a, e, i, o, r). I set up my code as such and it works perfectly fine in
  FontLab when I test it but when I try in Illustrator, only the start_swsh works.
  The end of the word remains normal. \r\n\r\nfeature swsh {\r\nignore sub @ALL @letter1'
  @ALL;\r\nignore sub @ALL @letter2' @ALL;\r\nignore sub @ALL @letter3' @ALL;\r\nsub
  @letter1' @ALL by @start_swsh;\r\nsub @letter2' @ALL by @start_swsh;\r\nsub @letter3'
  @ALL by @start_swsh;\r\nsub @ALL @letter1' by @end_swsh1;\r\nsub @ALL @letter2'
  by @end_swsh1;\r\nsub @ALL @letter3' by @end_swsh1;\r\nsub @swsh1' by @swsh2;\r\n}
  swsh;\r\n\r\nI've been reading a lot of forums about it, and have seen people say
  you need to have different lookups for the start and the end, but I don't understand
  the code (when I type in  'lookup ____' I don't know if I'm suppose to have _____
  somewhere else that it's looking up, or how that works, and the FontLab manual doesn't
  go into detail about this.)\r\n\r\nI'm at my wits end with this, any help would
  be greatly appreciated."

  body: "Gotcha, thanks. I'm still having the same issue. It makes no sense and it's
    driving me nuts! Below is a screen shot of how it appears in FontLab, and the
    second image is how it looks in Illustrator. Even if I delete the start_swsh altogether
    and just have the end_swsh it doesn't work. When I delete the ignore part of the
    end_swsh then it works but on every letter that has an end swash, even in the
    middle of a word. I'm thinking the problem must be in the ignore part of the feature?\r\n\r\nHere
    is the code as it stands, where @ALL is every character in the font minus the
    start and end swashes. Because I have 3 versions of each character, I need to
    sub all three by @start_swsh (hence @letter1 @letter2 and @letter3)\r\n\r\nfeature

  body: "Hm. Pretty sure this will work: take out @ALL from all the \"sub\" statements.
    \r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n<code>sub @letter1' by @start_swsh;</code>\r\n\r\nnot
    this:\r\n\r\n<code>sub @letter1' @ALL by @start_swsh;</code>\r\n\r\n(Note: It's
    really tricky to debug something like this without seeing how the font is set
    up and how the classes are set up. Contextual stuff can be confusing. Also, I
    usually try to use more descriptive names for my classes to avoid confusing myself.
    \"@letter1\" doesn't mean anything to me so it's hard to tell what you're trying
    to do. I would use a name like @non_start_swash1 or @non_swash1 or something like
    that, that tells you exactly what's going on.)"

  body: Thanks for the note, I will be better with my naming of classes. I removed
    the @ALL, but it didn't do anything. I think the problem has to be in the ignore
    part because nothing changes until I delete it, at which point all end swashes
    appear in the word (see image). [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot

  body: "That's because nothing is preventing the substitutions to take place. The
    function of the \"ignore\" statement is to filter out cases in which you don't
    want the substitution(s) that follow(s) to take place. If the \"ignore\" statement
    finds a match, the rest of the lookup is ignored. If the \"ignore\" statement
    doesn't find a match, then the rest of the lookup is executed and the substitutions
    take place.\r\n\r\nPart of the trick to writing features like this is to figure
    out exactly what you want to filter out and only what you want to filter out.
    From what I can see, you're filtering out cases in which @ALL precedes or follows
    @letter1, @letter2, or @letter3. Not knowing what's in these classes makes it
    impossible to tell exactly what's going on. "

  body: "Okay, I have end swashes for a c e i o r s t u v w. Since I have assigned
    three variations to each letter, I have to have three letter classes:\r\n\r\nletter1
    [a c e i o r s t u v w]\r\nletter2 [a.1 c.1 e.1 i.1 o.1 r.1 s.1 t.1 u.2 v.1 w.1]\r\nletter3
    [a.2 c.2 e.2 i.2 o.2 r.2 s.2 t.2 u.2 v.2 w.2]\r\n\r\nFor the start and end swashes
    I only have 1 option per letter, so no matter which variation (1, 2 or 3) is typed
    it will always become the same start or end swash.\r\n\r\nstart_swsh [a.swsh2
    c e.swsh2 i o.swsh3 r s.swsh1 t u v.swsh3 w.swsh2]\r\nend_swsh [a.swsh1 c.swsh2
    e.swsh1 i.swsh1 o.swsh2 r.swsh1 s.swsh2 t.swsh1 u.swsh2 v.swsh2 w.swsh3]\r\n\r\nThe
    @ALL class includes every since character in the font. My thinking was basically
    to find a way to say 'substitute characters in the class letter1, letter2 and
    letter3 by end swash only at the end of a line.' I figured out that removing the
    space from the @ALL class, it fixed the problem for a single word, but if there
    are multiple words in a line all of the start and end swashes appear before and
    after every word, instead of at the start and end of a line. \r\n\r\nSee screenshot
    for how it looks now, and how I would like it to look (I manually took out the
    swashes in this one)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2014-03-20

  body: "A couple things:\r\n\r\nIt's not possible to test for the start or end of
    a line of text in OpenType, which means there's no way to automatically get want
    you want.\r\n\r\nSince you have several glyphs in your @letterx classes that are
    not represented in your @start_swsh class, it would probably be better to keep
    the starting and ending classes separate, not just the the swash starting and
    ending glyphs, also the ones you're matching. Like this:\r\n\r\nnonstart_letter1
    [a e o s v w]\r\nnonstart_letter2 [a.1 e.1 o.1 s.1 v.1 w.1]\r\nnonstart_letter3
    [a.2 e.2 o.2 s.2 v.2 w.2]\r\nstart_swsh [a.swsh2 e.swsh2 o.swsh3 s.swsh1 v.swsh3
    w.swsh2]\r\n\r\nnonend_letter1 [a c e i o r s t u v w]\r\nnonend_letter2 [a.1
    c.1 e.1 i.1 o.1 r.1 s.1 t.1 u.2 v.1 w.1]\r\nnonend_letter3 [a.2 c.2 e.2 i.2 o.2
    r.2 s.2 t.2 u.2 v.2 w.2]\r\nend_swsh [a.swsh1 c.swsh2 e.swsh1 i.swsh1 o.swsh2
    r.swsh1 s.swsh2 t.swsh1 u.swsh2 v.swsh2 w.swsh3]\r\n\r\nThis way, you avoid the
    probably unexpected effect of some of your swash variants getting converted to
    plain letters when cswh is invoked.\r\n\r\nFinally, in your @ALL class, I would
    only include characters that are expected to be used in words, unless you think
    it would be good to have starting and ending swashes on passwords or other random
    strings."
