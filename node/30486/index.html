  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm doing a design for a super small company that wants a workhorse font for everything, but classy. I suggested Garamond and showed them a few different versions that I own, including the 2 Adobe Garamonds, an "Original" Garamond, and one other that I don't remember. They loved the Premier Pro from Adobe, but they really can't afford the $280.00 for Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic for six computers. 

So, what is your best recommendation?</div>

Dan - you may want to see if there is a Bitstream CD or a URW CD on sale... sometimes you can get their whole library for under 200 to 300 bucks - depending on the sale. BItstream fonts may be a little wider, and URW used a different kind of font program (I think it was called Icarus) but... they really did do excellent drawing and wonderful kerning for their fonts. And they are both considered, um, "real." I believe they are licensed for up to 5 computers - but please, do not take my word on that—have it verified.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This might be heresy, but I don't really like Goudy all that much. At least, from most of what I've seen. Things just seem, I dunno, sloppy. Like things weren't really drawn out consistently, very loosely. Not the spacing, just the letterforms themselves. Maybe it's a taste thing. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">You must be looking at Adobe's and Bitstream's Goudy.
Take a look at URWs...the letters fit.
And I adore the punctuation on Goudy.

Not heresy, nicest thing about type, we all have opinions, loves and hates.

I knew one art director who hated ITC Eras. Use to say, almost daily, that it is neither gothic nor italic. It just leans there. He also would tell me that he would put his own personal hatred aside and if the typeface worked with the job, he'd use it. I once showed him ITC Eras obliqued another 6 degrees, and when it ever came up that he would be using that face (which I think happened once since its release) it was used with the further oblique to make it look italicized.

Fortunately, it takes all kinds to make this world what it is. And if we all like the same exact thing—yikes, from a design point, it would be pretty boring.

I think this is when we also thank Toulouse Lautrec for insisting his local printer use color on the press. Otherwise, we'd all still be printing in black & white today!</div>
