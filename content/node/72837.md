  body: It's beautiful, and seems familiar, but I can't place it. I'd like to know
    what it's from, too (assuming it's from a typeface).

  body: You could try to get in touch with Graham Meade and find out what he based
    the ampersand of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/koster/|Koster]]
    on.

  body: It looks strikingly similar to <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/farnham/text-regular-ital-lf/">Farnham
    Text Regular Ital</a>. Most likely based off of the same image.

  body: "I agree that the general construction is similar, but neither of those looks
    close to my eye. There are a lot of ampersands that use that general form.\r\n\r\nI
    keep thinking that the ampersand in question is from a typeface from the 1920s,
    or maybe a little earlier. I have found a few from that period that are similar
    in construction, but don't match in the details and proportions."

  body: "The ampersand I believe is from an identity by Alan Fletcher / Pentagram.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what year, it might be pre Pentagram (Fletcher/Forbes/Gill -1972)."

  body: Ah, yes. It's in Pentagram's "Living By Design" book (1978). It's part of
    a logo for a company called Goods & Chattels Ltd. No mention in the caption whether
    it was custom or not or what year it was done.

  body: Fairly sure now it's by Fletcher/Forbes/Gill, probably designed late 1960's.
