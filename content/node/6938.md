body: Hi, I just found this website a few days ago and joined. I am working on my
  first typeface and would appreciate any feedback you can offer. The top version
  was inspired by linoleum cutting, but I decided to do a solid version as well in
  case the &#34;cut&#34; version was too much. Do you think I need a solid version?

  body: The top version actually has a lot of potential, I think. The bulging outlines
    combined with the inlines seems to give it a third dimension, which is rare in
    type. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Therese, <BR> <BR>After looking at it again, the center stem of the lc &#34;m&#34;
    being so short seems to create a huge &#34;counter&#34; that doesn&#39;t balance
    with the other letters IMO. Maybe when you show more of the letters it may blend
    in for all I know. Just feeling talkative I guess. I like it .
