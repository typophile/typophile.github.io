  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This custom font was designed for the SPERRY RAND CORPORATION, and later used by REMINGTON RAND when Sperry sold off one of their Divisions. It has a very mechanical feel to it, with the horizontal strokes only slightly thicker than the verticals and diagonals. Notice how the second R in SPERRY has no vertical, creating some very nice white space! Also see how the N and D in RAND share a vertical. So, does anyone know the name of this font or who the designer is/was? I&rsquo;d be very curious to know if they designed any other fonts.<img src="/images/old-images/SperryRemOfMach_6459.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I did some Google searches, but could only get an idea that maybe the logo is from 1967. Apparently that is when it first started being used on electric typewriters they made. Possibly more detailed or determined searching could get you the name of the design firm, but unless the designer was someone well-known, you might never know that. In any case, that was over 40 years ago, and this &ldquo;techno&rdquo; style is now (unfortunately, in my opinion)part of our vocabulary when we want to say we are high tech. I appreciate how much variation is possible in these simplified letterforms, especially in the hands of professional designers, but it becomes so trivialized by being done so often, and often so badly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for doing some digging, Mike (btw, I&rsquo;m a Mike too). Not sure about that year, though. I believe the font was first used in the Sperry Rand Corp. logo, after Sperry acquired Remington Rand in 1955.  Another clue that this might be a custom font:  My friend, who worked for Sperry back in the 70s, found a sheet with letters A-Z (all U/C), numerals, and a few punctuation marks, but it is not a complete character set by any means. There is no font name, design firm or type designer listed, only the Sperry logo on the bottom. Who knows, it might have even been done in-house by someone in their Graphics Dept  who knew something about font design.</div>
