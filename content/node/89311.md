  word \"neato\" is custom designed for sure, but can anyone identify the font behind
  \"robotics\"? It is not TheSans. Note the b and t. I could imagine that the dot
  from the i was removed and the body was elongated."

  body: "\"neato\" is probably based on <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blippo-lt/|Blippo]]</strong>\r\n\r\nI
    think \"robotics\" it is actually <strong>[[http://www.lucasfonts.com/typeshow/?ts-font=TheSans&ts-style=ExtraLight|TheSans
    Extra Light]]</strong>\r\nwith customized /b and /i (cutting an angle on the top)
    and removing the left part of /t\r\n"

    is such an ugly font, and that someone has the guts to make it even worse ;) You
    are also right about TheSans. Thanks!"
