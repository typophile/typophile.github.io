body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nMe again. Here's three different v's. In case you haven't
  noticed yet, the difference is in width. Hope you can tell me wich one looks best
  to you. I think the choice is between the first and second, but I put the original
  (third) also in the picture. When I judge things like this I usually take some steps
  back before I look at it. Is ther anything else (except printing and squeezing eyes)
  I might do for better judgement?\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vpict_5583.jpg]"

    integration of the feature at many weights.\r\n\r\nOr stencil breaks?\r\n\r\nThey
    look like the come from a different typeface."

    and the 'i' needing a rounded corner \u2014 <em>something</em> to integrate them
    with the rest of the characters."
