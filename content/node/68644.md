    flip on the z to see what i mean!"

  body: "Interesting effect.\r\nBut I think the f and t don't work.\r\nAlso, z could
    be a little less curved.\r\nNot sure about x."

  body: This type looks excellent. I'm a fan of the short curves mixed with tight
    angles. The only thing that stands out to me is the awkwardness of the "s" as
    mentioned before, and the "f." I think the terminal that is facing left should
    face right, so it looks more like a true "f" shape.
