    and the sort of type you see on machined signage (laser or bit-cut into plastic),
    and has been discussed here before (I\u2019m sure someone else will reference
    the post).\r\n\r\nGotham Rounded (with some artificial condensing) would be a
    decent substitute:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham-rounded/styles/\r\n\r\nMisses
