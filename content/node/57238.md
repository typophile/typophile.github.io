body: "We are pleased to announce the newest members of the Endurance Pro\u2122 font
  family. Endurance Pro Condensed light, regular, semibold and bold are now available
  in TrueType and OpenType formats.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TYPOFILE-Endurance-condensed-pro_5560.jpg]\r\nEndurance
  Pro was designed by Steve Matteson to fill the need for a more elegant, less industrial-looking
  neo-grotesque sans serif design. The name Endurance lends itself to the fact that
  the typeface was designed to work well under extreme conditions from billboards
  to mobile phone screens. \r\n\r\nEndurance Pro was designed with on-screen legibility
  as a key attribute and with careful detailing for a more refined appearance in large
  sizes. All the Endurance Pro fonts feature an extensive character set with WGL support
  (Greek, Cyrillic, Turkish, Baltic, etc.) to meet the needs of multinational companies.
  Also included in the fonts are OpenType typographic features including old style
  figures, proportional figures, fractions, superiors and a slash zero.\r\n\r\nThere
  are now 12 Endurance Pro fonts in the entire family. Ascender is offering all the
  Endurance Pro fonts at a 30% discount for a limited time. Visit http://www.ascenderfonts.com
  for more information\r\n\r\n"
