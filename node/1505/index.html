  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR> <BR>I am new to this board.. well posting wise.. &#40;my first post!&#41; but i&#39;ve been reading it alot over the past few months. <BR> <BR>anyways, <BR> <BR> <BR>oh yes.. i posted this in the design forum because it seems that you cant make threads in the critique forum for some reason? <BR> <BR>currently im taking typography 1 at my college. its alot of fun, our current project is to design a 27th letter of the alphabet using a provided face. of all faces I was given times new roman! haha! anyways, I wanted to see what people thought about this, or any suggestions. I am still learning about type, and i figured this place could help me out. we have to render these in ink at 2.5 x height, 5 times, replacing the created character with a letter in a 5 letter word.  <BR> <BR>my current concerns pertain to the descender on my letter. should it be the same distance down as the &#39;j&#39; ? or should it be smaller? personal preference? i was looking at the face, and i guess i could argue that it was meant to be a unique form in the alphabet like the loop on the &#39;g&#39; my professor brought this up in critique tonight. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17778.gif" alt="kerned example"> <BR> <BR>thanks for any feedback!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fascinating project! Your teacher is good. <BR>And Times is a great candidate: it&#39;s &#34;constructed&#34; but has good readability, plus it has all those funky IPA characters designed for it which you might look at. <BR> <BR>I see some problems with you proposed new character, but I think you need to back up and look deeper at the problem before going too far towards a solution. <BR> <BR>I would start with the &#34;Intro to Typeface Design 110&#34; under Courses on Typophile itself. It&#39;s a great &#34;formal&#34; aesthetic approach in understanding not just shapes, but their underlying structures. <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s a world of richness beyond that exercise. There&#39;s the issue of spacing, where your new character is problematic &#40;it may hit a subsequent left-hand descender&#42;&#41;. There&#39;s the issue of what the/an alphabet <i>needs</i>: does it need a character that fits in more &#40;like the &#34;n&#34;&#41; or that diverges more &#40;like the binocular &#34;g&#34;&#41;? And does it need an x-height, ascending, or descending &#40;or both!&#41; character? <BR> <BR>&#42; It might help to decide if the new letter is a consonant or a vowel, or if it&#39;s just phonemically superflous &#40;like the &#34;c&#34;, &#34;q&#34; and &#34;x&#34; are already&#41;. <BR> <BR>I would love to make concrete recommendations, but since this is about the process of learning, it&#39;s better if you try to answer questions like the above - the answers will draw out the solution from within you. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Randy, since email delivery is down &#40;not just for me, I assume?&#41; I was working my way down manually, and I saw Drew&#39;s thread here first, <i>then</i> the other one with your post!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Since I think the Design section is a better place for this than Typography/Composition, just to streamline things here&#39;s Randy&#39;s post from the other thread: <BR> <BR>&#34; <BR>Hi Drew,  <BR> <BR>Let me be honest. I think the length of your decender is the  <BR>least of your problems! Sorry...  <BR> <BR>As a start at curing your letter of it&#39;s maladies, let me point  <BR>you to Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s course at typeophile that looks at  <BR>the very assignment you&#39;ve got: Type Design 110  <BR> <BR>Honestly, first check out what he&#39;s saying. What are the  <BR>characteristics of times roman? Given that, is the basic  <BR>stucture of the &#34;letter&#34; consistent with Times? How could it  <BR>be more Times-like in structure? Where is there evidence of  <BR>a pen? What angle is it held at? As a result, where are the  <BR>thick parts? Where are the thin parts? Where are the serifs?  <BR>Where does times roman break it&#39;s own rules?  <BR> <BR>Your glyph needs all these questions to be asked. Take a  <BR>look, and if you&#39;re still at a loss, I&#39;ll give you more specific,  <BR>practical pointers.  <BR> <BR>Looking forward to seeing the fruit of your studies!  <BR>&#34; <BR> <BR>BTW, I agree with what you said, except I would [predictably] caution against the &#34;pen&#34; approach. You&#39;ll note for example that Drew&#39;s glyph has one thick horizontal and one thin: depending on the &#34;structural context&#34; of the rest of the glyph, that might actually work best, irrespective of chirography. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks alot guys. <BR> <BR>I took a look at those tutorials. Honestly, I learned more looking at those than the 5 weeks into this semester of this class, however our first 2 projects involved just tracing letters at 5&#34; xheight in ink &#42;pefectly&#42; to appreciate differences in the forms. Then we did kerning. <BR> <BR>Attached are a few revisions. I started to think about how you would write it with a pen, and where the serifs should be. I am not sure how to determine whether it is balanced correctly? like, the counter space.. too big? small?  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17873.gif" alt="evolution1"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The most odd part of your letter, Drew, is the hanging direction of your descender. It seems contrary to the flow of the latin alphabet. Isn&#39;t it supposed to be the 27th character for the latin alphabet? I agree with Hrant, that you were give a good type face to start with. Something with irregular serifs could&#39;ve caused many more problems.</div>
