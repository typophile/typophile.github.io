  probably stupid easy and must have rolled over it, but previous user to this computer
  installed a million crappy fonts from dafont).  \r\n\r\nI can't find a font that
  matches the cut edges that College Gameday uses in my font library.\r\n\r\nIm doing
  a poster at work and they sent me this as reference for the font they want.  Close
  enough is good enough, but exact match is even better.  Do we have anybody that
  wants a cookie?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/files/2010/07/espngdlogo.jpg\">\r\n\r\n"
