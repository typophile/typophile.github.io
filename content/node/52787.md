  the University of Illinois. I am interested in studying the use of online discussion
  forums for critique and how they can be improved. I have a short (11 question) survey
  and I would like to invite you to complete and return it to me. \r\n\r\nThe survey
  contains background questions about the value and role of critique and ends with
  specific questions about the use of technology. It would be most helpful if you
  could focus on assessing the use of forums such as this one in forming your response
  to the technology-specific questions. The data will be kept confidential and only
  ever presentd in aggregate form. I would appreciate hearing about your experiences
  and learning from them. My return email address is in the survey. \r\n\r\nSurvey

  \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for considering, \r\n-Brian Bailey"

    fora by loading a Microsoft Word document, which we can do by \u201Cright-click[ing]\u201D
    in \u201CIE\u201D?\r\n\r\nWhy can\u2019t we just use stone tablets or a slate
    and chalk?\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"

    and send it back via carrier pigeon. What's so hard about that?

  body: "Wow.  I was excited about getting to fill this survey out since I think Typophile
    is the very model of a well-functioning online community.  But a .DOC file?  There
    are at least a couple hundred free survey websites out there, and you're sending
    us a .DOC file?  Can you maybe mail it to me on a floppy? (5 1/2 inch, please.)\r\n"
