  body: "Using my Serif Guide the closest font I could find in terms of certain key
    letters like the e, g, b and y that I thought were unambiguous, was Hollandse
    Mediaeval, and there are  a number of disconnects there, including the y and the
    A. The lettering appears to have been drawn before etching (or whatever process
    forms the raised leters), and so may have been a custom design. The sign was apparently
    made in 1996, but they may have tried to use old American types as models. If
    so, I haven't incorporated them in my Guide yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hollandse_full_5870.gif]"

  body: "What makes you think that Jan?  \r\n\r\nEven if I ignore the e crossbar,
    I am not finding anything particularly close. If it's based on an old American
    typeface, my best chance is to scan through McGrew and hope there is something
    close. In the first third of the book, I haven't found a single Roman serif with
    a single-storey g. (regardless of e-style)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I've finished reviewing Mac McGrew's book, and found no 20th century type
    that matched this. I don't have books showing much of anything earlier, and McGrew's
    book does include 19th century types that had 20th century issues by foundries.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way I only found about 10 non-slab serif families that had a single-storey
    g. Certainly not a common feature. Now if they rotated the 'e' as Jan suggests,
    maybe they used a backslanted version of an italic g?\r\n\r\nIt's pretty hard
    to ID something if modifications like this are to be considered. Might as well
    say it's a custom type design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
