body: I&#39;m digitizing a client&#39;s hand-lettering. Is there any sure-fire way
  of giving the font a unique font ID number? Fontographer assigned it the same font
  ID as Futura Light Italic &#40;I was generating font files using the &#34;Easy&#34;
  mode&#41;. When I took the font to another computer and double-clicked the screen
  font icons inside the font&#39;s suitcase, the previews showed up as Futura Light
  Italic! <BR> <BR>I know this is a very minor thing, but when I give my client the
  font files, I would like him to see his own hand-lettering in the preview window...
  BTW, this is to be a proprietary font, not a commercially released font &#40;the
  FOG manual recommends getting a unique font ID number from Adobe for the latter&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Any help on this would be appreciated. <BR>

  body: 'Any number you pick will conflict with some existing font somewhere. According
    to a technote on Apple&#39;s developer site: <BR> <BR>&#34;As of late 1990, all
    free font family IDs had been registered, so any new font families created after
    that time must share their ID with a registered family; Developer Technical Support
    no longer registers family IDs.&#34; <BR> <BR>For the whole document, which should

  body: Thanks, Mark.  <BR> <BR>So it&#39;s a case of too many fonts and too few numbers,
    then. :-&#40;

  body: Well, as it says on that page, applications shouldn&#39;t be using font IDs
    anyway. They should be using font names. Font IDs are only supposed to be used
    by the system for keeping track of fonts internally. The system is supposed to
    assign an unused ID when there is a conflict.  <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, I have seen
    conflicts such as you describe occassionally. I think it depends on how the fonts
    are installed and there may be some ambiguous situations, such as when you preview
    an uninstalled font in a font managment utility &#40;Font Reserve, Suitcase&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>My suggestion would be to choose a different number. Higher numbers,
    I think, would be less likely to conflict with an installed font, but you will
    have to experiment to be sure.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Whatever you do, don&#39;t use a
    font ID higher than 16382 for latin fonts. The font may be interpreted as non-roman
    &#40;Chinese, Arabic, etc.&#41; and will not display correctly.&#41;

  body: Wow. Thanks for all the info, Mark. The client has a test version of the font
    now, but I&#39;ll be sure to change the ID number if he wants any other changes
    made to the font. <BR> <BR>Thanks again!

  body: 'There are two different numbers that may be in play: Apple&#39;s suitcase
    FOND IDs, and Adobe&#39;s Type 1 UniqueIDs. <BR> <BR>Adobe does not believe UniqueIDs
    are still important in this day and age; you can leave them out. <BR> <BR>FOND
    IDs are required for suitcase-based formats, and the range the number falls into
    determines what the OS thinks the script of the font is &#40;e.g. MacRoman, Cyrillic,
    etc.&#41;. However, the OS automatically resolves conflicts so the specific number
    is no longer important. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: This is great information. I&#39;ve had the same understanding as some of
    you and have stressed about releasing fonts for fear of conflicts, but now I see
    I&#39;ve stressed unnecessarily. This resolves a question I&#39;ve had for some
    time- thanks Thomas and Mark! <BR> <BR>jared
