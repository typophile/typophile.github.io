body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am a student of graphic design who is new to typography
  and would like to develop my knowledge in this area , as it's a very important aspect
  of my job. I purchased some recomended books on typography (Fonts , tamye riggs.
  \ Typeography essentials. Helvetica, homage to a typeface), but the only thing I
  can do is look at them and read the rules , but I don't feel like I'm learning alot
  by doing that , at least when I start a new project on photoshop. I recently started
  to draw by hand using a pencil famous and cool logos , mainly only-lettered logos
  , and I feel like it's deepening my visual knowledge on the topic  since I improved
  a bit my \"type vision\".\r\n\r\nIs there a better method wich you reccomend/suggest
  to improve my typography skills?\r\n\r\nThank you for the attention,\r\nPierluigi
  Giglio"

    Get reproductions from penmen of the Renaissance era and exercise formal writing
    with a broad nib pen.\r\nThose two things I found most valuable."

  body: "Try creating a digital facsimile of an old letterpress document.\r\nAnything
    prior to the 1960s.\r\nThat will require a lot of discretionary \"manual\" adjustments,
    thereby training you in the nuances of typographic setting, and also give you
    some perspective on the relationship between different technological eras, which
    is a driving force in typography."
