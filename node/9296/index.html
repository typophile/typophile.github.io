		<div class="commentbody">You got the conclusion wrong in your title. Today, virtually all fonts are issued in the form of outline font software which is indeed protected by copyright in the US. This is borne out by the reference you cite: <BR> <BR>&#34;However, scalable fonts are, in the opinion of the Copyright Office, computer programs, and as such are copyrightable&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;... the Copyright Office is persuaded that creating scalable typefonts <BR>  using already-digitized typeface represents a significant change in the <BR>  industry since our previous [September 29, 1988] Policy Decision.  We <BR>  are also persuaded that computer programs designed for generating <BR>  typeface in conjunction with low resolution and other printing devices <BR>  may involve original computer instructions entitled protection under the <BR>  Copyright Act.  For example, the creation of scalable font output <BR>  programs to produce harmonious fonts consisting of hundreds of <BR>  characters typically involves many decisions in drafting the <BR>  instructions that drive the printer.  The expression of these decisions <BR>  is neither limited by the unprotectable shape of the letters nor <BR>  functionally mandated.  This expression, assuming it meets the usual <BR>  standard of authorship, is thus registerable as a computer program.&#34;  57 <BR>  FR 6202.&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not just Adobe, I believe - large sections of the type industry were involved in lobbying. An organization called TypeRight did much of the legwork, as I understand it. <BR> <BR>And there was a case that upheld many key principles of intellectual property law for fonts: Adobe vs. SSI &#40;1998&#41;. You can find the decision here: &#60;<a href="http://directory.serifmagazine.com/ethics_and_law/copyright/judgement.php4" target="_blank">http://directory.serifmagazine.com/ethics_and_law/copyright/judgement.php4</a>&#62; <BR> <BR>A few key pieces: <BR>&#34;...the court finds that the Adobe font software programs are protectable original works of authorship.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;...the court finds that the typeface designs are statutory subject matter entitled to patent protection.&#34; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The legal information given by Mr. Thomas Phinney is incorrect. This is understandable because Mr. Phinney is paid by Adobe for his task of promulgating erroneous legal information. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Adobe vs. SSI &#40;1998&#41; <BR>This &#34;decision&#34; cannot be quoted, firstly because it is not a supreme court decision and secondly because it was a settlement. Mr. Phinney should publish the text of this &#34;decision&#34; if he thinks otherwise. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Copyright Office [September 29, 1988] Policy Decision <BR> <BR>Mr. Thomas Phinney does not mention the decisive requirements, &#40;1&#41; firstly that a computer program is only protected by copyright if it is a creative work, &#40;2&#41; secondly if the author of this creative work is a human being that has written the source code of this computer program. <BR> <BR>Note to &#40;1&#41; creative work <BR>Most fonts are not creative work, but instead copies or clones or imitations of existing fonts. For instance, Adobe&#39;s Garamond is an imitation of the original Garamond and hence not creative work. <BR> <BR>Note to &#40;2&#41; source code <BR>The author of the font as computer program must have written the source code himself. The Copyright Office requires that the source code is submitted in the case of a litigation. But this requires that there exists a person &#40;= a human being&#41; that has written the source code of the program. However, it seems that there does not exist any font, the source code was written by a human being, because nobody except the programmers of Fontlab, Fontographer etc. are mentally able to do that. <BR> <BR>Example: Neither Mr. Thomas Phinney nor Mr. Robert Slimbach nor any other person at Adobe wrote the source code of the font &#34;Adobe Garamond&#34; because none of these persons is mentally able to write the source code of a computer program that handles mathematical Bezier curves. And therefore there does not exist any source code written by Mr. Thomas Phinney or Mr. Slimbach and hence the &#34;Adobe Garamond&#34; is not protected by US copyright. <BR> <BR>Wilhelm Ohnesorg, Germany</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As someone who has sparred with Thomas on this issue before, I do not fine Wilhelm&#39;s arguments compelling. I am particularly skeptical of the assertions that &#40;a&#41; only Supreme Court decisions can stand as precedent and &#40;b&#41; that using a tool to mediate between the creative work and the &#34;source code&#34; used to represent a font invalidates any copyrightability. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s an interesting <a href="http://www.asianlaws.org/cyberlaw/library/ip/copy_font.htm">summary</a> from Asian School of Cyber Law. <BR> <BR>The law seems a bit gray to me; there is enough contradictory precedent, law, and policy to keep a fleet of lawyers comfortably employed for a while. However, in light of the Adobe vs. SSI settlement, no ethical person would release a copy or digitally derived clone of a font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wilhelm has obviously not actually read the material. I put up a link to the Adobe vs. SSI decision. There was a settlement in the case, but only after Judge Whyte made a SUMMARY JUDGMENT on many of the key issues in the case. Wilhelm and others should read that at the provided link, and familiarize themselves with what a summary judgment is. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a lawyer, I don&#39;t even play one on TV, and I&#39;m not paid to provide legal information. I&#39;m just reading stuff and providing some links and quotes. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, the very first Type 1 fonts were in fact programmed in raw code form without a visual tool. I am myself quite capable of programming PostScript in this fashion, and even recently did so for a project, but I sure wouldn&#39;t bother doing a font that way. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

Therefore Mr. Slimbach cannot be the author of &#34;his&#34; font software program and therefore &#34;his&#34; font software program cannot be protected by copyright. <BR> <BR>&#40;50 506 hsbw 0 49 vstem 101 40 vstem 269 40 vstem 357 49 vstem -124 42 hstem 635 41 hstem 135 -124 rmoveto 158 113 156 123 hvcurveto 0 88 -40 68 -83 77 rrcurveto -107 98 -35 39 0 50 rrcurveto 37 27 23 32 vhcurveto 21 0 30 -8 31 -21 rrcurveto 8 -6 6 -2 14 0 rrcurveto 19 14 18 14 hvcurveto 18 -21 28 -56 vhcurveto -143 -123 -143 -119 hvcurveto 0 -104 59 -68 71 -70 rrcurveto 55 -56 84 -77 0 -59 rrcurveto -40 -39 -22 -30 vhcurveto -24 0 -25 5 -36 30 rrcurveto -7 6 -6 3 -12 0 rrcurveto -22 -13 -18 -18 hvcurveto -29 33 -21 47 vhcurveto closepath 40 348 rmoveto -120 120 -6 70 0 44 rrcurveto 0 50 19 29 33 28 rrcurveto 0 -82 27 -43 107 -102 rrcurveto 78 -74 44 -62 0 -91 rrcurveto 0 -41 -8 -39 -40 -36 rrcurveto 0 81 -35 48 -99 100 rrcurveto closepath endchar&#41; <BR> <BR>In &#34;Circular 61&#34; &#40;= &#34;Copyright Registration of Computer Programs&#34;&#41; of the United States Copyright Office, the person who claims to have written the source code of a &#34;font software program&#34; must deposit 50 pages of &#34;his&#34; source code and must prove that &#34;he&#34; as a human being has written the source code. Therefore it is not enough to declare at the Copyright Office that a non-human machine or a non-human dissembler program has automatically generated the source code by disassembling the font file previously created by a font editing program. <BR> <BR>Nobody in the font industry is mentally able to write the source code of a &#34;font software program&#34; with the consequence that nobody is allowed to claim copyright to &#34;font software programs&#34;. Of course, I too am not mentally able to write the source code of &#34;font software programs&#34;. However, as opposed to Mr. Slimbach, I do not claim copyright to &#34;font software programs&#34;. Therefore I need not be mentally able to write the source code of fonts. <BR> <BR>The notice &#34;Copyright by Adobe&#34; included in a font can be ignored, unless Adobe proves that the source code of the &#34;font software program&#34; was written by a person who is mentally able to write the source code of &#34;font software programs&#34;. If you show him the above example of the source code of a font by Adobe and he cannot say WHICH glyph is drawn by this source code, you know that he is taking the court judges for a ride. <BR> <BR>ANOTHER EXAMPLE <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s assume George Bush, who is unable to write PostScript programs, buys a PostScript printer and writes a letter with a word processor. If George Bush makes a printout of his letter, the PS printer driver &#40;= this is a non-human entity!&#41; automatically &#40;!&#41; generates a PS program and sends it to the printer. Is George Bush the &#34;author&#34; of this &#34;software program&#34; according to the Copyright Act? No, because George Bush is unable to write PS programs and therefore he cannot be the author of any PS programs. <BR>  <BR>The same is true with PS Type 1 fonts &#40;and with OTF fonts containing PS Type 1 Bezier curves&#41;. And the same is also true if a person COULD write PostScript programs, but DOES NOT do so. The copyright act requires both, as far as fonts are concerned: A person who CAN write the source code of &#34;font software programs&#34; and who actually DOES it. It is not enough, if Adobe tells the Copyright Office that there COULD perhaps exist somewhere an author who perhaps COULD write the source code of a &#34;font software program&#34;. <BR> <BR>Those who are not familiar with copyright law may wonder why the copyright acts of all nations require HUMAN beings as &#34;authors&#34;. This is because the &#34;work&#34; is defined as a &#34;personal&#34; &#40;= human&#41; creation in all copyright acts. Therefore mountains and lakes, flowers and trees, apes and monkeys, machines and computers and computer programs cannot be the authors of copyrighted works. The same is true of lawcourt judgements: They must be made by HUMAN judges. Apes and monkeys will not do. Nor will computer programs do that automatically generate the judgements. <BR> <BR>Wilhelm Ohnesorg</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The problem for me, William, is that sometimes typophile regulars get out of control but then apologize and work through the discussion. If I took every urge I had to end some debates that happen here I would be seen as a heavy-handed moderator.  <BR> <BR>However, your point is a good one and we do need some guidelines easily viewable from the profile page or something. <BR> <BR>That said, I don&#39;t like the tone in this thread. Thomas doesn&#39;t need someone like me to stand-up for him, but in this case I am going to end this thread now.</div>
