  Norwich, England. \r\n\r\nI printed with a wood letter typeface, called 'Sans Bold
  \"34\". I've created a logo out of this font, and now want to use it for the rest
  of the identity. Is anyone familiar with this typeface, and could you recommend
  a computerised version?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nHarry Hepburn"
