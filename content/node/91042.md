body: Hi there, I was desperately trying to get hold of the font 232 MKSD [[http://www2.wind.ne.jp/maniackers/232mksd.html]]
  for a logo. Every site i have been directed to will only give me the font in .sit
  format. Could someone please identify a similar font for me, which comes with a
  font family. I would greatly appreciate it.
