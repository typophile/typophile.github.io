  about modern art from Kyoto. I would love feedback, ideas, criticism - don't be
  shy. This is a new job for me, very type heavy and any support I can get would help
  me a lot. \r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\nDo you like the \"nesting\" of the type?\r\nDoes
  the orange line do anything for you?\r\nWhat do you think about splitting up \"modern
  art from\" and \"boston's sister city\"?\r\nand anything else you can think of...\r\n\r\nSome
  issues to consider: it has to be vector and simple, it's a modern art exhibition
  of ceramics, prints, and textiles.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLee"

    posted this...\r\n\r\nThe first thing that jumps to mind is \"Why Univers?\".
    Univers is sooo commonplace and without character, great for small print, but
    certainly not my first choice for a logo.\r\nI like the nesting, though if it
    were me, I would try some variation in sizes, and maybe put them more toghether
    even.\r\nThe placing of the orange line is strange. Why not at the top of the
    x of \"Kyoto\"? I even wonder if you need it at all; I always think that when
    a line is needed in a typographical logo, it isn't designed well enough. For me
    personally: loose the line.\r\n\r\n"
