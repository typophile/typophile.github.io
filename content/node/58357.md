body: "I have recently been working on a project for a recycling company I would love
  to share with everyone and get their thoughts. Its still at the developmental stage
  at the but have been shooting some test shots seen below.\r\n\r\nThe shots which
  are for a corporate brochure are based on the idea of recycling in general. Making
  something out of nothing. There were lots of ideas floating round at the start\u2026we
  liked the idea of the brochure being transformed into something else after it had
  been used. We rejected this on the grounds that we would rather people kept the
  brochure than \u2018recycled\u2019 it and also through print concern for a very
  small budget. We also considered every bit of text throughout the brochure being
  shown on packaging of various materials that the company may be recycled. However
  we felt that this would compromise the brand a little too much and also might effect
  legibility. In the end the client went for a concept that concentrated on almost
  utopian style shapes or illustrations being made using entirely recycled materials
  which may be recycled, or \u2018rubbish\u2019.\r\n\r\nSo for the past couple of
  weeks we have been sending out rather pushy emails insisting to everyone that we
  really did want to take their colourful rubbish off their hands and are very proud
  of our growing pile. We think the original test shots are looking really good. They
  are not too \u2018pretty\u2019 which is important when displaying recycled rubbish
  I think but have such depth that are really interesting. We liked the idea of keeping
  them all really simple shapes and not too detailed as this almost makes the reader
  of the brochure have to engage with both the pictures and the copy more. Anyway,
  we are expecting to shoot the final shots soon so I will hopefully show more in
  a couple of weeks. Feedback at this stage would be great!\r\nAnyway we are doing
  the final shoot tomorrow so will post them and get some feedback.\r\n\r\nYou can
