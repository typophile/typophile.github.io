  in Amsterdam for an American business magazine. Can anyone recommend a photographer
  in the Netherlands? Looking for someone with solid publication experience and an
  online portfolio that my client and I can review.\r\n\r\nFailing that, I'd be interested
  in the names of Dutch business magazines whose art director/photo editors I could
  contact for referrals.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMarc"

    while researching a story about the Netherlands. Really worth checking out; he''s
    a very accommodating, resourceful guy into the bargain. '

    your recommendation before hiring someone. I ended up going with Jeroen Bouman,
    who has lots of experience with environmental/business portraits -- and seems
    to be a nice guy, too.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jeroenbouman.com/"
