    the fact that quality-minded foundries had to manually overcome the pantograph&#39;s

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>I remember the trapping argument between you and Hrant from
    a previous thread. <BR>I have no idea which of you is correct and though I had
    initial, mild, passing interest in the question, the way the debate ran soon cured
    me of that. <BR>My current position on the trapping debate is that I don&#39;t
    know, and I don&#39;t care. In fact, I don&#39;t give a flying &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;
    through a ring donut whether trapping is a real phenomena, or a fantasy. <BR>What
    is blindingly obvious though, is the connection between the previous debate and
    Hrant&#39;s image. In the previous debate you refuted the idea of ink trapping
    by &#40;among other things&#41; suggesting that the pantograph was not capable
    of cutting the sharp details required by Hrant&#39;s trapping theory. The caption
    on the new picture from Hrant shows that the fine detail was not in the hands
    of the pantograph operators, but was left to hand-cutters. <BR>If you can&#39;t
    see the connection then you are either being deliberately stupid, or you are...well...just
    stupid. <BR> <BR>

    <BR>If you read through the archives, you&#39;ll find that I disagree with Hrant
    on almost everything I&#39;ve ever discussed with him. <BR>However, with an extensive
    background in the areas which require the rigorous development of logical arguments
    I can tell the difference between a consistent position and bland unspecific ramblings.
    <BR>Hrant, wether right or wrong, is &#40;when he can lay off the abrasiveness&#41;
    always logical and consistent in his arguments. He is clear in his presentation
    and is capable of identifying what is and isn&#39;t relevant to his case. <BR>
    <BR>You, on the other hand, appear to be incapable of stringing together even
    a single sentence of coherent argument. <BR> <BR>As I said before, I don&#39;t
    know &#40;or care&#41; wether you or Hrant are correct on the trapping issue.

    so far is gibberish. <BR>If you have something to say, please say it. <BR>

    are getting involved in this discussion unless you are interested. It occurred
    to me that perhaps you are interested. <BR> <BR>But you have misread, and are
    misquoting me. I don&#39;t really want to go over all the material with you at
    this point. The last time I began &#34;teaching about pantographs&#34; Hrant and
    Gerald Lange started <BR>insulting me and the conversation stopped. That is why
    there is that open letter thing going on I would assume. So some of your issues
    may be addressed over there on that account. But I do not believe they belong
    here. <BR> <BR>If the conversation had not stopped maybe some of you in the Forum
    would have learned something. You may not like what you learned. You may have
    an opinion on it after you have learned. But you may have learned. There are not
    many people around who cut punches. Do you or Hrant? So this is a second chance
    and if there is serious rudeness you will be out of luck. <BR> <BR>I am certainly
    not soliciting opinions from the ignorant. Opinions are not great teachers.  <BR>

    I would really like to conclude one single question first. <BR> <BR>What does
    this picture with the caption have to do with ink trapping? <BR> <BR>For the life
    of me I am without answer. Maybe you have one. I request specifics, not some generalizations
    of opinions as I am well versed on those. I understand that you and Hrant do not
    like pantographs. And at least one of the two of you believe that Pascal link
    illustrates ink trapping. <BR> <BR>For me, the &#34;Pascal Fantasy&#34; is truly
    laughable. That is where we depart. I am not able to pretend to believe the unbelievable.

    <BR>2.&#41; And why? <BR> <BR>First of all let me say that this has absolutely
    nothing to do with ink trapping or whether the pantograph can get a sharp inside
    corner or not. I would prefer to have a punchcutter cut my type by hand because
    it would remove several stages of the industrial manufacturing process: no precise
    and scaled drawings, no card patterns, no brass patterns. The pantograph is an
    industrial tool that enables a technician to reproduce as a punch a design by
    a type designer; this is not to say that the technician is without skill or that
    operating a pantograph is easy, but it is something that large numbers of people
    were successfully trained to do. In order for those people to be able to do their
    work, type designers and/or drawing offices had to produce precisely drafted outline
    drawings of type at large sizes, from which patterns could be derived. Meanwhile,
    the hand punchcutter can sit down with just the designer&#39;s rough-and-ready
    drawings at any size and produce a typeface. I admire the directness of this process,
    and the non-division of labour it implies.'

    and we&#39;ll very rarely get what we &#34;want&#34;. So what&#39;s a good balance
    between having the pantograph cut all the sizes from one set of exact drawings

    derived to satisfation &#40;like the &#34;n&#34;&#41; while others &#40;like the
    &#34;s&#34;&#41; can&#39;t, at least not without some amazing algorithm. So to
    me a selective use of the pantograph with subsequent/parallel handcutting is a
    realistic ideal. <BR> <BR>In this scenario, handcutting can be used to sharpen
    corners &#40;and add traps&#41;, since the pantograph was unable. <BR> <BR>Note
    also that ATF used to have complex methods of automatically scaling master drawings

  body: 'It would be a mistake for any persons reading these posts or posting their
    views here to assume that any good pantograph is a second-choice method of cutting
    a type. Neither is the pantograph a substandard method of making a type. A good
    pantograph is a precise, marvellous piece of engineering, that properly handled
    will give you an accurate translation of your original drawing, just like a good
    digitizing tool will. <BR> <BR>As one who has just spent all of Sunday and all
    of today so far, attempting to re-cut a punch for a damaged lower case f, &#40;normally
    this takes a few two to three hours&#41; I can assure you that it takes care,
    dedication and determination to cut a letter on a pantograph, just as it does
    by the hands of a punchcutter. <BR> <BR>After cutting four type designs by hand,I
    now choose to use the pantograph. Granted, one must make a pattern. Once the pattern
    is completed it can within some size constraints be used to cut other sizes of
    punches with the proper scaling. In addition, other weights can be achieved with
    the same pattern. I do not suggest that a person can make a book and a bold weight,
    rather, it is possible to compenstae for weights between, say, 12 and 16 point.
    <BR> <BR>I use the pantograph for the same reason that large foundries turned
    to it in past decades: even with the task of hand cutting master patterns, and
    then the metal working pattern, I can complete a typeface in one size much quicker
    than I could if I attempted to hand-cut it. <BR>I admire and respect those who
    can and do cut punches by hand. Dan Carr of Golgonooza Letter Foundry, and Stan
    Nelson of the Smithsonian Inst. both do this. I am  told that they in return respect
    my work, which is pantographed. <BR> <BR>It is possible to hand-nick out tight
    corners with a graver once the punch is cut, and I have done this to every patrix
    and punch I have cut over the past 25 years. <BR> <BR>If you are ever fortunate
    enought to be in the position where you can afford to have a type cut for your
    private press, take a tip from me: either way is not to be slagged off as inferior.
    In the end, a good design, well cut and well fitted will be a joy to print with.
    Incidentally, not a soul has mentioned a thing about a good fitting. <BR> <BR>The
    elitist attitudes, among letterpress printers at least, is not limited to punches.
    there are those who will not use type that is not cast on a Barth foundry caster,
    and blow off Monotype as though is were &#34;unclean&#34;. In my world, any type
    that is well designed and is &#34;type high&#34; is worth printing with, and that&#39;s
    that. Hell, there&#39;s nothing wrong with the Linotype machine either! <BR> <BR>Look--I&#39;m
    not a crank, and I won&#39;t get into a lot of fuss about type. Type is a joyful
    thing. Some people who post to this forum give me the feeling they just ain&#39;t
    having a good time unless the are calling somebody else &#34;stupid&#34;.  <BR>Like
    the sign on my shop door says: &#34;Be nice or go away&#34;. <BR> <BR>Come visit

    for hand-setting, is it not true that: <BR>1&#41; The quality is highly variable
    &#40;much more than foundry type&#41;, because it&#39;s a DYI deal? <BR>2&#41;
    It necessarily uses softer alloys which wear faster? <BR>3&#41; The italics are
    made to fit the Roman widths, which most people consider a serious flaw? <BR>
    <BR>As for Linotype, you can&#39;t handset it, plus from what I <BR>know the alloys
    are even worse, and there&#39;s no kerning. <BR> <BR>BTW, what about photopolymer,
    Jim? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not being elitist, just quality-minded, more than cost-minded.
    When it comes to preserving the integrity of a type designer&#39;s design decisions
    &#40;for example the incorporation of trapping, or even just making very sharp
    inside corners&#41;, it seems that the pantograph needs help. That doesn&#39;t
    make it useless, not at all &#40;like I opined above&#41;, but it does make it
    dangerous not to see its limitations. You can&#39;t blame the tool for the results,
    but you can admit for example that the pantograph created a great excuse for &#40;gradually&#41;
    dismissing optical scaling, as well as making fonts with rounded inside corners.

  body: I should clarify that when I answered Gerald&#39;s questions, above, I was
    not intending to suggest that the pantograph is inferior in either output or efficiency
    to hand cutting punches. I was simply indicating which process I would choose
    to have a design cut with if I had the choice and all else was equal &#40;no time
    constraint, equal cost, etc.&#41; I&#39;m simply attracted to the directness of
    the hand cutting process, in which design and manufacture are so closely entwined,
    as opposed to the industrial process in which design and manufacture are more
    distinct. It is the same thing that I enjoy about designing type directly on the

  body: 'Hrant <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve posed some good points. Let me see if I can answer
    them. <BR> <BR>The adjustments that one can make on a pantograph are: Weight Adjustment,
    which is done by alteration the size relationship between the width of the cutter
    and the stylus which is used to trace the pattern. If a cutter is a fixed size,
    but the stylus which is used for one point size is .100&#34; &#40;or one hundredth
    thousands of an inch&#41;, you will get a certain width of cut removed from the
    punch blank. <BR>If you use the same cutter again, but decrease the size of the
    stylus by say 20%, the amount of metal removed will be increased by a relative
    amount. Since you are cutting the neck of the punch to leave the face, the face
    will be thinner by that amount. If the scale of reduction is large &#40;like 20
    to 1&#41; the relative amount will be very slight, so that for every adjustment
    for weight there is a fine control over the slimming effect on the face. Sorry
    this sounds fiddly. <BR> <BR>The other adjustment is for condensing, extending
    and obliqueing. Obliqueing would be reserveved for sans. This is done by making
    the vertical and horizontal settings for scale on the machine of uneven amounts.
    One way pulls the letter to extend  it. The other way pulls the letter in height
    to condense it. Obluqueing is a setting where only one of the four adjstments
    are thrown &#34;off equal&#34;. <BR> <BR>You are right, and I would never argue
    otherwise. Nicking out corners IS because of a limitation of the pantograph. <BR>The
    proper employment of the pantograph requires the hand finishing steps of cleaning
    up corners and pinches. There have been many punches cut by Monotype &#40;compositioin
    sizes&#41; where hand finsihing of corners etc was not undertaken. The resulting
    round in the corners was very small; two-one-thusandths of an inch. A few days
    ago I printed some pieces which I had set in 10 pt Garamont Small Caps. If you
    look at the type under a stereo scope, you can see a slight softening of the corners.
    However when I printed it, it looked very sharp and precise; no soft look, but
    I&#39;m a fussy pressman. If somebody really dumped the ink to it, it would look
    bad whatever had been done to the punches.   <BR>If you consider that the pantograph
    saves the lion&#39;s share of the cutting and the time, it is a small price to
    pay to need to finish the punches/patrices by hand. I don&#39;t know for certain,
    but I assume that that is what the great foundries of Europe did in their making
    of punches. You will have read that there was a great outcry from punchcutters
    in the early part of the century when the pantograph was finding its way into
    the craft. The same sort of resistance was met when the Computer hit the graphic
    design business. Not preaching. Let me sum it up: the pantograph saves the time,
    and does a perfect job. The corners need a human hand. Remember that Arion Press
    and Pennyroyal Press and most of the fine presses of the UK use Monotype. Nobody
    could exist if they had to have Stempel type. You need volume. <BR> <BR>&#62;Concerning
    the use of Monotype fonts etc&#62; <BR> <BR>1. The quality is variable only if
    a bum is casting the type. It was no more a DIY deal than the type being made
    at ATF. You need a good operator to make type. If it were a DIY affair the caster
    would only run for about five minutes before the DIYer burned his butt off. Certainly
    the metal delivery mechanism of the Monotype is not as robust as that on a foundry
    Pivotal caster or a barth Caster. However, if properly adjusted and maintained
    the Monotype &#40;Comp&#42;, Orphan Annie, Giant, or Super will deliver very good
    type that will last a long time. &#42; Type from a Comp caster was never intended
    to last as foundry type. It was thought of as transient in the way that Lino and
    Intertype was . . .  use it and melt it down. No distribution, and no lost labor.
    People who buy Composition size fonts from existing foundries in with the idea
    that they are buying permanent foundry type need to be aware that they are getting
    soft metal type. This is true of all faces from 6 to 12 point, and a few faces
    where the foundry has large comp mats up to 24 point. It&#39;s disappointing to
    have that happen, and it gives Monotype a bad name unjustly. <BR> <BR>2. On all
    Monotype machines but the comp caster it is possible to use the hardest of foundry
    metals. I do this all the time.  <BR> <BR>3. You may be confusing the italic restrictions
    with Linotype and Intertype, where the Italic &#34;a&#34; would ride along on
    the same matrix as the roman &#34;a&#34;, and had to be the same width. Monotype
    had no restrictions artistic restrictions regarding its italics, so in that matter
    it had the same freedom as foundry type. This applied to the composition as well
    as the display sizes.  <BR> <BR>Of course Linotype could not be handset. I sing
    its praises only in that it could compose very fine books, at least in my opinion,
    and it prints beautifully. Liontype did overcome the lack of kerning capabilties
    by making a suite of logotype &#40;kerning pair&#41; matrices of some of ists
    more artistically based faces. If you bought them, you could set good looking
    type. <BR> <BR>I think Photopolymer has been one of the best things to hit letterpress
    since its decline as trade in the fifties. Photopolymer has brought the letterpress
    process into fashion again, and has made it possible for printers to satisfy exactly
    the wishes of designers. But look--I have been doing this almost continually for
    fifty-five years. I&#39;m a REALLY old fart, and Photopolymer doesn&#39;t do it
    for me. There is just something about the actual handling of type that makes me
    feel good. Still. <BR> <BR>I do not aim the word &#34;elitist&#34; at you. I just
    cringe when I get in roomful of likewise old letterpress farts who pull out all
    their theories about how only a blacksmith &#40;blacksmith is one of their favorite
    words because its easy to pronounce&#41; would use other than Barth-cast type,
    and only a blacksmith would use a certain kind of paper. It goes on and on. And
    without exception they are usually awful printers. <BR> <BR>OK, this got long.
    It&#39;s not easy to cover things like this without taking some time; and I am
    sure this drivel will be of absolutely no interest to most people who read the
    form . . .  but YOU are interested so I responded. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR> '

    regard to your statement &#34;Remember that Arion Press and Pennyroyal Press and
    most of the fine presses of the UK use Monotype. Nobody could exist if they had
    to have Stempel type.&#34; The recent Pennyroyal Press Bible and many of the Arion
    Press books are done with photopolymer and, while the UK is somewhat of a holdout,
    many of the fine presses there are now turning to photopolymer, as have many in
    the US and elsewhere. The reason is as you stated. Nobody could exist if they
    had to have Stempel type... but today that would also include Monotype. I could
    not survive as a letterpress printer without photopolymer. The economics of metal,
    which includes the labor factor, are quite difficult to work with. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t have a problem with metal, I still have tons of it, but I can&#39;t
    afford to stay in business if that is all I have. Since my concerns are primarily
    typographic &#40;mainly book typography&#41;, I will readily admit I am enamored
    with, and thankful for, the opportunities the digital era has brought with it.
    Water-washout sheet photopolymer was not used very much by fine printers prior
    to the digital era and I think the partnering of the two technologies did indeed
    save letterpress and has ensured its survival. Well, at least, for the moment
    and the forseeable future.

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>Good morning to you, from Finland. <BR> <BR>You are not misunderstanding
    it. Monotype have single cellular composition matrices.  <BR>  <BR>A Linotype
    face, on the other hand, have both the roman and italic &#34;A, B C &amp; so on&#34;
    punched into the same matrix. <BR> <BR>The fit of a Linotype face is determined
    by the width of the &#34;matrix&#34; itself. In other words Linotype matrices
    are composed side by side, then cast into a line-of-type. <BR> <BR>Monotypes casts
    each character individually. <BR> <BR>That been said, Linotype did an absolutely
    incredible job of disguising this technical handicap and my hat goes off to them.
    <BR> <BR>However, there is without doubt, a compromise. I think in hindsight their
    great contribution to the history of printing should not be disparaged. That their
    punch cutting departments monumental task of manipulating typefaces with great
    sensitivity should be admired. <BR> <BR>I say that knowing that all typefaces
    are not equal. In other words, instead of looking for some face that is not so
    good, you should look for their faces that were unbelievably good. Unfortunately
    my books are in Vancouver or I would show for you an example. But, I think it
    would not be hard to find that example of Linotype Caslon Oldstyle. There is dangers
    in saying much bad about it, because I could surprise you with something. The
    &#34;Caslon Challenge&#34; was not my idea. <BR> <BR>The difficulty in mechanical
    typesetting was no easy feat and that many fortunes were lost trying to make typesetting
    quicker. Linotype did that.  <BR> <BR>Monotype also. <BR> <BR>The printing and
    publishing industries have gained by the inclusion of mechanical setting. <BR>
    <BR>Linotype Companies were fierce competitors to both the English and American
    Monotypes. I am the owner of the Lanston Type Library, I supplied American Montypes
    matrices for over a decade, and if I can admire Linotypes great work, I believe
    all of us should capable of keeping our opinions in perspective. <BR> <BR>I admire
    them because they simply did a remarkable job. They gave us lots of trouble. <BR>

    simply attracted to the directness of the hand cutting process, inwhich design

    have been answered here, but just to summarize . . .  <BR> <BR>Linotype had the
    constraints of duplexing &#40;roman with italic, or roman with bold, usually&#41;
    wherein the equivalent letters in each design had to have the same set width.
    It also had the constraint of being unable to perform any kerning. <BR> <BR>Monotype
    had the constraint of a unit-width system. I am not as familiar with Monotype&#39;s
    matrix grid, so I may not have a grasp of all the details, but: due to the arrangement
    of the grid, I believe, certain characters were required to have the same unit
    value. This was the source of the 18-unit system, although it&#39;s unclear to
    me whether all Monotype models conformed to the same system. I think there were
    a few different configurations developed. See McGrew, page 294, for a diagram
    of one such arrangement. <BR> <BR>So, in creating Sabon, Tschichold had to contend

    The only constraint was that the duplexed characters must match each other.  <BR>
    <BR>There are a few characters which were usually most severely affected -- like
    the italic &#39;f&#39; and &#39;j&#39; and, to a lesser extent, often the italic

    <BR>Later, in photofilm, the early Linofilm had an 18-unit system &#40;adopted

    the writing prism.  <BR> <BR>Hrant -- <BR> <BR>I believe that the &#34;em&#34;
    which was divided into 18 units was not a standard face-size em and could be varied

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>An 18 unit system could be very flexible for a designer, because
    a particular letter &#40;for instance an h&#41; need not always be assigned a
    value of 9 units. If for artistic reasons the designer wanted the h to be wider
    or narrower, that letter could be assigned to another unit row. This did not throw
    off the positioning as far as the caster was concerned, because the keybuttons
    on the keyboard could be linked up to accommodate the h&#39;s new position by
    the use of a different set of keybars. The keybars wa a sort  of hardware/software
    that linked up the keybutton with the new position in the matrix case. <BR> <BR>Another
    thing that made the Monotype flexible for unit values was the direct result of
    FW Goudy&#39;s pushing for some expansion of the unit value system. Lanston&#39;s
    resident designer/genius Sol Hess, was responsible for re-engineering this set
    of new unit values. The first example as far as I know was Goudy&#39;s Kennerley.
    Gerald Giampa would be the one to confirm this since he for many years held the
    Monotype material and matrix making equipment at his large printing plant/foundry
    in Vancouver. Kennerley was based on a 20 unit system. There was also a 15 unit
    system. British Monotype&#39;s Univers is, I believe, 15 unit. As Gerald Giampa
    has noted it was also possible for a keyboard operator to add or subtract units
    from a particular letter. Of course this is not to do with the design process,
    but it was a hand feature. <BR> <BR>On the matter of italic constraints, there
    were absolutely no limitations put upon the artistic freedom of italic, other
    than that the designer had to work within a grid of fixed units. With the ability
    to pick and choose what amount of units a designer wanted a character to occupy,
    there was lots of room to move. In addition Monotype characters are made to kern
    in the matrix case.  When I made my own matrixcase of large comp &#40;18 point
    Hannibal&#41; I had to stick with the precise positions allotted to me by the
    use of a British Monotype matrixcase layout &#40;and caster wedge which makes
    these widths in the casting&#41; for British Monotype Garamond, I had no trouble
    in altering my own characters to fit the spots with an appropriate amount of space
    each side of the letters. I had the advantage of being able to test these fittings
    and kernings since I digitized a computer version of the intended hot metal type
    that I could test and re-test as work progressed, without having to cut a single
    master patrix. I think Lanston would have loved to have the Computer back in those
    days. <BR> <BR>I am aware that Linotype hot metal had no hard and fast grid of
    units for a new typeface, but it is my understanding that they did establish grids
    when they entered the field of making fonts for new technology. I am not informed
    completely on this, but I remember Rod MacDonald, who did a recreation of Cartier
    &#40;Cartier Book&#41; mentioned in a previous writing about Carl Dair, that when
    he visited the Linotype company with the proposal that they do the production
    on his drawings, he was handed a set of grids to work by. Perhaps Rod could shed
    some light on this. <BR> <BR>One has feel sorry for the poor designers who had
    to design a typeface for a typewriter back then. Talk about unit constraints!

  body: Jim, <BR> <BR>Thank you, if I had said the same thing I would have been accused
    of trying to sell used Monotypes. <BR> <BR>Goudy&#39;s Kennerly was indeed the
    first. That story began, however, with the trauma Goudy had while designing Goudy
    38. A story best left untold.  <BR> <BR>It is illustrative to note that Goudy
    opted for &#34;less than 18 units&#34; choosing instead &#34;only 15 units&#34;
    for Kennerley Oldstyle. <BR> <BR>This was also the case with the even later typeface,
    Universe 15 units where chosen, not 18. So some designs required more, some less,
    some got them and some did not. <BR> <BR>But Jim has said much and rather well.
    I advise a good read. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>Lanston Type Company

    <BR> <BR>Gerald -- No, I haven&#39;t actually set type on the Linotype. While
    I was growing up, however, I used to spend a little time in the back room of the
    local newspaper where my mother worked and where they were still using Linos into
    the late 70s.  <BR> <BR>My interest in Linotype derives from my research on Dwiggins.
    My understanding of designing type for the Linotype has also been augmented by
    conversations with Matthew Carter, who provided much of the information I cited
    above. My understanding of the practical operation of the machine &#40;at least

  body: 'INFORMATION ON UNITS FOR THE LINOTYPE SYSTEM <BR> <BR>I contacted Mike Parker.
    I would provide a bio of his credentials, however I feel that his reputation is
    well enough known for his work at Linotype. Parker and Mat Carter were both founders
    of Bitstream, presently Parker is working as a consultant to the Font Bureau.
    <BR> <BR>Graciously Mike sent me this material because I asked him to clarify
    the Linotype unit system. Also I have a note in uppercase which is not his words.
    The text is in its entirety with the exception of materials at the end which were
    edited because they do not pertain to the Linotype question but are personal arrangements
    for the two of us to meet. <BR> <BR>&#34;Dear Gerald,  <BR>  <BR>Normal Linotype
    matrices were machined to the appropriate width of the pair of characters to be
    placed one above the other on the matrix,typically:  <BR>roman &amp; bold roman
    &#39;a&#39; for 10 point Excelsior with Bold, roman &amp; italic &#39;a&#39; for
    10 point Excelsior with Italic, or bold roman &amp; bold italic &#39;a&#39; for
    Excelsior Bold with Bold Italic.  <BR> <BR>To obtain the normal character the
    matrix sat on normal alignment. To obtain the auxiliary character the matrix was
    raised a fixed amount, placing the auxiliary character opposite the mold, correctly  <BR>aligned.  <BR>  <BR>The
    Linotype problem in preparing each character was to design the roman, italic,
    bold and bold italic versions to all fit on on the same width &#40;without, of
    course, permitting any character to kern off the matrix&#41;.&#34; &#40;NOTE,GERALD
    GIAMPA: LINOTYPE FIT WAS SLIGHTLY WIDER BECAUSE OF MATRIX CONTSTRUCTION.&#41;
    <BR>  <BR>&#39;During the nineteen forties Teletype driven Linotype machines came
    into existence. The idea was to replace linotype operators with faster tape drives.
    In order to justify lines predictably, each character had to have a predictable
    width. Fairchild established a standard width for each character expressed in
    a single fixed set of eighteen units to the set width em to be used for all typefaces
    regardless of typeface design. The wider the column width, the larger the eighteen
    unit set width required.  <BR>  <BR>The Associated Press and United Press International
    distributed their stories in printed form accompanied by punched paper tape containing
    codes for characters, word spaces, and line endings. You would hang the tape on
    a teletypesetter-equipped linecaster.  <BR> <BR>Slugs would emerge at a great
    pace as long as the machine was equipped with a TTS font with characters cut to
    the appropriate TTS set widths for the column width. <BR>  <BR>By the 1960s the
    most popular newstext font had become 9 point 8 set Corona with Boldface No. 2.
    The most popular classified font was 5 1/2 point 6 set Spartan Book with Heavy.
    These two fonts were produced in huge volume, along with others like them, perhaps
    leading some folk to wrongly believe that all Linotype fonts were cut to the eighteen
    unit system. <BR> <BR>Mike Parker&#34; <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'Gerald -- <BR> <BR>According to my references, Sabon was developed in the
    mid 1960s. Bringhurst says Stempel released the foundry version in 1964, and Linotype
    and Monotype released machine-composition versions in 1967. Other accounts simply
    date the design to 1966 or 1967. <BR> <BR>Thanks for quoting Mike&#39;s letter.
    This jibes perfectly with what Matthew and I discussed.  <BR> <BR>Hrant -- <BR>
    <BR>I didn&#39;t quite follow your second point about Sabon &#39;a&#39; above.
    You&#39;re right in point 1, he couldn&#39;t make it a &#34;touch&#34; wider.
    Examining Sabon more closely, it appears to be the result of the combined constraints
    of <BR>Monotype and Linotype together.  <BR> <BR>The Sabon &#39;a&#39; is allotted
    to 9 units, which is wide compared with the &#39;e&#39;, for instance, which is
    on 8 units. If Sabon had been designed solely for Monotype, the roman &#39;a&#39;
    could have been put on 8 units, which would have given a more traditionally Garamondesque
    proportion; while the italic &#39;a&#39; could have been placed on 9 units, so
    as not to be too narrow.  <BR> <BR>If instead, Sabon had been designed solely
    for the Linotype, an intermediate width could have been designated that struck
    a compromise between the duplexed &#39;a&#39;s, with the roman maybe just a tad
    wider than ideal and the italic just a bit narrow. <BR> <BR>But Tschichold had
    to adapt to both constraints -- duplexing for Lino, unitizing for Mono. So he
    made the choice to make the two &#39;a&#39;s fit the 9 units &#40;which yields
    a noticeably wide roman &#39;a&#39;&#41; instead of cramping the italic in the
    8-unit slot. <BR> <BR>NB: This is just my analysis/reconstruction/conjecture;
    I don&#39;t have an actual account of Tschichold&#39;s process. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

    Hopefully this will be edifying. <BR> <BR>Here is a quick-and-dirty adaptation
    to show what Sabon might have looked like if Tschichold had chosen to assign the
    &#39;a&#39; to 8 units instead of 9: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14874.gif"
    alt="Sabon adjusted"> <BR> <BR>The narrower roman &#39;a&#39; looks elegant, but
    the corresponding, duplexed italic &#39;a&#39; looks obviously cramped. Since
    the counter of the italic relates more closely to other characters in the italic,
    the discrepancy is quite noticeable. The roman &#39;a&#39; relates less obviously
    to any other character, so any deviation from ideal proportions is less noticeable.
    <BR> <BR>A narrower italic &#39;a&#39; is perhaps not especially objectionable
    in and of itself, and this design might have been accommodated by adjusting the
    &#39;b d p q o&#39; etc. &#42;But&#42; because of duplexing these adjustments
    would not have been possible to reconcile across both faces. <BR> <BR>So, Tschichold
    had to make the best compromises he could, given the combined constraints. Here
    is the original to compare with: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14875.gif"
