  within a font -- I'm interested specifically in serifs (and display at that), but
  it is something that applies to sans aswell. I have seen a few text faces where
  stress fluctuates anywhere between the vertical and diagonal, and I have assumed
  this to be for readability reasons (that it creates a more varied letter shape for
  the reader's eye, and helps maintain interest). Is it a mortal sin, amongst the
  purists at least, to do this? Theoretically it is against the grain of consistency
  in a font, but do you think it is enough for other constants like weight, and proportion
  to maintain harmony? On top of this, I lean towards mixing forms derived from various
  genres into fonts -- this is not to say I don't believe that forms should sing in
  harmony together. I suppose my methodoly could be seen as what Peter Bilak calls
  'chirographic'.\r\n\r\n \r\n"
