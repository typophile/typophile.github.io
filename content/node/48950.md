  clothes.  We want the feel of the site to be sort of british, european, established,
  royal, professional, formal, etc.  For the menu items, I want to use a Serif Font
  in Small Caps.  I will be rendering it fairly small, so it can't be too elaborate.
  \ \r\n\r\nI will be rendering the font in the web page with sIFR. \r\n\r\nA mock
  up of my design is currently here: http://archimedescloth.com/wireframe/page16.html.
  \ I am pretty happy with the font in the menu items now, it is MS Reference, with
  a 0.5px stroke, with the 1st letter of each word at font size 19, and the following
  letters at size 16. I'd prefer to find a font that looked something like this without
  having to modify the stroke and font size.  \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I really appreciate
  any advice. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSeph"

  body: "Thanks - those are good suggestions, but not exactly what I'm looking for.
    \ \r\n\r\nFor this application the delta between the height of the big caps and
    small caps needs to be minimized.  Most Serif Small caps seem to have the big
    caps about 50% taller than the small caps.  I'd like to find a font where the
    delta is more subtle - like 10-20% or so. \r\n\r\nNot sure if this is clear -
    to put it another way, the small letters should be closer to the same size as
    the bigger letters (although still smaller). \r\n\r\nThus, when I put them on
    the screen in a menu bar where I am vertically constrained, the small letters
    can still be legible. \r\n\r\nAny other ideas?\r\n\r\nSeph\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If height control is what you want in caps, consider FF Atma:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_atma_serif_book/\r\n\r\nFeijoa
    has a cracking set of small caps:\r\nhttp://www.klim.co.nz/feijoa_charset.php\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you want the delta to be small, try using small caps for everything and scale
    up the first letter 10% It will look fine, and not like fake small caps. If it
    were me I'd set straight small caps with no full caps.\r\n\r\nLastly, small caps
    should be generous in width and set loose. The narrow width and tight tracking
    on the caps in your layout looks like poop. All of this my opinion and not hard-n-fast
    rules. Good luck!"
