body: I am trying to identify some script faces used in embroidery, but they seem
  to come from a world of their own, with no basis in calligraphy or typography. Any
  help in finding a source would be appreciated. I&#39;ve attached four of the ones
  I am trying to ID. <BR> <BR>alastair<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42063.gif"

  body: The first one reminds me of Monotype Script. The second and third look similar
    and look a bit like French Script or Typo Upright or others in that vein. The
    third one looks more or less like Commercial Script. <BR> <BR>I doubt very much
    that you will find fonts that match these. They seem to be loose interpretations
    of common script styles.

  body: I believe a lot of commercial embroidery is done with machines programmed
    &#40;if that&#39;s the right term&#41; with script styles that were developed
    independently of computer fonts. Think of how long embroidered lettering has been
    put on jackets and clothing -- much longer than digital computer fonts. I think
    in many cases the technology is not related, although I believe some new machines
    can somehow use fonts, but now I am in way over my head. &#40;This last comment
    was based on someone who wrote to me saying that they had used fonts for machine
    embroidery. I may have misunderstood her.&#41; <BR> <BR>Can you say why you want
    to identify them? As Mark suggested they are similar to some existing styles,
    but that doesn&#39;t mean they originated with &#39;fonts&#39; as we usually mean
    the term now.

  body: Embroidery technology uses both PostScript and TrueType font outlines. Using
    proprietary software, monograms are created using the font outlines which are
    programmed to create fills or outline with thread. Embroidery software is now
    available for MAC and WIN platforms at a cost of $6K to $12K. I&#39;m currently
    using a app on my G4, designed by a company called Punto. Lots of fun creating
    hats and shirts for friends.

  body: 'I would also note that embriodery fonts require a unique outline that relates
    directly to the size of the monogram, the thickness of the thread, and the material
    used. To toot my own horn I have several fonts available on MyFonts that were
    designed for embroidery technology. '

  body: Yes I know about Pfaff&#39;s computer programme that will embroider anything
    &#40;on their high-end sewing machines&#41;. This is for a former student of mine
    who is trying to modernize a company that uses these styles and presumably is
    going digital. I&#39;ve always enjoyed the parallel between cross-stitched samplers
    of the 18th &amp; 19th century and late-20th century digital bit-mapped fonts.
