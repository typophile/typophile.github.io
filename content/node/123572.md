body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAs the title suggest I am not looking to ID a particular font
  but I am looking for suggestions for a font that would fit the project I am working
  on. A group of actress are producing and all-female version of Glengarry Glen Ross.
  I directed the presentation video that will be featured on their IndieGogo page.
  It seems that the photographer/designer has gone silent and the onus is on me to
  think of a design.\r\n\r\nMy initial thinking is to use a bold font that can start
  smaller and ended up bigger, as if it was shouted. The thing is, what this kind
  it would be so easy to fall into comic book style territory and this is what I want
  to avoid.\r\n\r\nAny font comes to mind?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
