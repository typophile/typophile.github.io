Anecdotes, stories about the OS first seven years?

<div class=commentbody>That article lists one of OS X's features as "More than $1,000 of the best fonts available today, including Baskerville, Herman [sic] Zapf’s Zapfino, Futura, and Optima." Maybe Zapf only references Zapfino, but that's an unfortunate placement of Futura between those two. Unless Zapf did the digital version?
That said, I was watching the WWDC (or MacWorld, I can't remember which) where OS X was first introduced, and I was reminded of how many things we now take for granted that were considered revolutionary 7 years ago — mostly things that are simple graphic operations or UI things that seem so intuitive now.
EDIT: Also, it was really odd seeing a Stevenote set in Marker Felt.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here's part 2 of the Stevenote from 2000 (with the demos). It's really interesting to see what people ooh and ahh at.

<div class=commentbody>I got it and installed it on my G4 Cube right away, which was really exciting, but there were not many native applications at first, mostly just stuff that came with the OS. Everything else had to be run in Classic mode.
It felt very foreign at first, like it wasn't really a Mac, but a Next machine. I played with it a bit from time to time, but booted into OS 9 most of the time so I could get real work done.
It was quite frustrating because OS 9, though better than earlier systems, was still fairly prone to system crashes and freezes, and lots of other headaches. OS X, even in the first version, rarely had anything like a system crash (i.e., kernel panic), and if a program did crash, it never affected anything else. Classic did go down pretty easily, but at least it didn't bring down the whole system when it did. So I was always wishing more things ran native so I could switch over to X for good.
Aside from lack of native applications, the other thing that kept me from using OS X full time was that it was painfully slow. It wasn't really until 10.2 (Jaguar) that it was usable, speed-wise.

<div class=commentbody><cite>Anecdotes, stories about the OS first seven years?</cite>
Seven years ago I was still running Linux, Solaris and OpenBSD most of the time with a little Windows at the office. IIRC I picked up an iBook to play with OS X after the 10.0.5 release, and it became my primary OS after I dropped by the Apple store to get my free 10.1 update. It’s been at least a few years since I used any of the other UNIX systems at home, and my Windows box hasn’t even been plugged in since some time last year.
OS X may not be perfect, but in my mind it’s the best desktop OS around. Now if only Photoshop CS 3 could handle complex files on my Intel Mac!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Things I miss from the old days...
Extensions- Now we have frameworks, kernal extensions, components, and daemons that do the same thing but they have cryptic names. Don’t even think about trying to trouble-shoot on your own! I liked being able to go in to the system folder and tell you what everything was but forget that now! The internals are even more intricate and delicate. I like how the old OS would hide everything from you.
The Power button on the keyboard- Steve Jobs took it away because he said that most users leave their machines on. What a bunch of crap! If I have workstation that hogs a ton juice the way a G5 does of course its going off and of course its that big machine is going on the floor too. So now I have reach down to turn the machine on- not cool! Keyboard power-up was a great feature.
Clones- Power Computing was the performance arm of the mac universe at the time. I guess we can always install OS X on a white box with some concerted effort.
The smiley mac at start up- its all austere now. Leopard is a cold place to be. I actually liked the pinstipes in 10.1 and the original Aqua but times have changed.
I liked the crash sounds too. Macs crash all the time but even that should be special. Remember the car crash on the 6100 AV? !!!
PowerPC- I still believe that anything Intel can do IBM can do better. If they actually tried to keep pace But IBM’s focus is on gaming consoles and intergrated products that don’t have the rapid pace of desktop processors. The Power6 Lite would have been the G6.
Remember what Copland was supposed to do??? THEMES!!! C’mon Apple get with it!
All in all I have never felt comfortable using Windows and I am very glad Microsoft and Apple do compete in the OS space. OS X does so many things well and very stable... although application quits are still common.
Thing I wish Apple did right now:
Complete Complex Contextual OpenType Support !!! Until they do, I'm standing pat with Tiger. Good enough is actually great!

<div class=commentbody>Seven years for an OS? I'm not in the Mac world anymore. But I remember the early days in the 80s when the OS wouldn't last seven months. Remember when they updated with wierd numbers, and a different version number for Finder and System?</div>

FYI, Macs have a very decent deep-sleep mode. Yea, they'll still trickle power, but he was right...most folks do NOT turn of computers anymore.
7 years now? I'm feeling old.
