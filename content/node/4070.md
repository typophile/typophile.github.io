  him insane.  I work for a giant engineering firm and people come to me with Powerpoint
  presentations they&#39;ve tried to do themselves, and ask me to make a poster /
  brochure / display out of them. &#40;Oh, the pain.&#41; <BR> <BR>But YOU can help!  <BR>
  <BR>I am looking for advice about the best &#40;for me&#41; graduate programs in
  graphic design in the U.S. or Canada. I have an undergrad degree in Advertising,
  but it was more of a business-focused program. So I&#39;m looking for a school that
  has a practical, professional orientation, as opposed to one that stresses theory
  / research. Basically, I&#39;d like to take this degree and go work for a design
  firm. <BR> <BR>I have several years of design and production experience in in-house
  design departments at medium-sized companies, &#40;as well as having done a bunch
  of freelance work&#41; so I don&#39;t need to start from the beginning, with a Bachelor&#39;s
  design degree. <BR> <BR>I am leaning towards Pratt. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts / advice
  / resources?  Feel free to plug your alma mater or diss other schools -- it&#39;s
  all good. <BR> <BR>You rock, <BR> <BR>--Troy '

  body: 'One problem you are going to find, is that most post-graduate degrees are
    theory driven. The practical comes about as a result of your theoretical research.

    <BR>So many choices. I&#39;m interested in the PhD end of this question. What
    about the rest of you. I&#39;d love to hear about schools based on their experience
    at the schools.  <BR> <BR>Troy, my personal &#40;and biased&#41; choice would
    be Reading, but that isn&#39;t in Canada or the U.S.'

  body: Another thought. When I was looking for mysself, it was important for me that
    typography be important to the program. That they specifically talked about it.
    What is important to you? What about the faculty? That was also important to me.

    the Pittsburgh AI ... you should hear my former CD on that subject... we had a
    decent artist or two come out of the program but by and large ... <BR> <BR>A lot
    of Photoshop, Illustrator and Freehand geniuses but very weak on basic skills
    -- poor type, little sense of spatial relations. I was instructed to fire the
    last one; she was a grad but didn&#39;t know how to use any of the layout programs
    &#40;&#34;Our instructors didn&#39;t focus on that,&#34; she said&#41; and set
    an entire project in screen fonts, false bolds, false italics and didn&#39;t know
    why they defaulted when printed. <BR> <BR>Out of the four or five grads that passed
    thru our shop, none had strong conceptual skills, most had difficulty working
    under deadline and none could work without continual direction. <BR> <BR>In fact,
    my CD demanded that our  recruitment <BR>ads state &#34;understanding of spatial
    relations a must.&#34; When asked, one candidate and AI grad said  &#34;yeah,
    I get along well with everybody.&#34; <BR> <BR>They all had beautiful, beautiful
    books however. <BR> <BR>I know somebody who went to RISD and would&#39;ve killed
    to have been able to afford him. Also, have you considered some of those fabulous
    workshops? I&#39;m always getting mailers for them; that&#39;s another thing I&#39;d
    love to be able to afford. '

  body: ' Hi Tracy, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t blame you at all. There is a large contingency
    of AI grads that do only as much to finish the program instead of taking it seriously
    and relating it to future career aspirations. I only felt professionally challenged
    by about 5% of my classmates and took school very seriously. <BR> <BR>This perhaps
    is a good time to get back to Troy&#39;s original post and suggest that if you&#39;re
    going to take this effort seriously and make the most of a career in art and design,
    commit yourself to learning as much as you can, have an open mind, and take it
    seriously. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t express enough in today&#39;s economy after all
    the agencies and design firms had mass layoffs how many designers are out there
    looking to be hired. Many of them just aren&#39;t that hireable &#40;see Tracy&#39;s
    post above&#41; and the older set isn&#39;t retiring anytime soon. That is why
    you must take school seriously and befriend designers and teachers to learn all
    they can teach you about how it REALLY is, ask questions - you&#39;ll get answers!
    <BR> <BR>I do have one warning for you though . . . The more you learn about design,
    the less likely you will be fixing Powerpoint files two years from now, and once
    you do learn design, it&#39;s very hard to revert back to seeing things without
    a critical eye. <BR> <BR>Good Luck! <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' If I read this right, I think Troy is asking for <BR>a &#39;portfolio school&#39;
    as opposed to a &#39;theory <BR>school.&#39; The former focuses on graduating
    <BR>kids  with a solid body of work, as opposed to <BR>just good thinking. In
    my opinion, the &#39;portfolio&#39; <BR>schools that effectively teach theory
    have the <BR>edge because they teach execution. <BR>Execution is 50 percent of
    good design.  <BR> <BR>Then again, Sagmeister and Carson have <BR>made healthy
    careers off of great ideas with <BR>mediocre execution. <BR> <BR>Re: Powerpoint.

  body: ' hehheh! Death to PowerPoint! <BR>Thanks for not taking offense! <BR>Not
    to sidetrack from the original post again but , my conscience is pricking me ...
    to be perfectly fair, my experience with AI grads was two years ago and, shortly
    before our agency&#39;s demise, the school did contact us about how hires were
    working out and what we thought their program&#39;s strengths and weaknesses were.
    They did seem genuinely concerned about shortcomings. <BR> <BR>I think some of
    the best learning of all comes from getting to sit next to wonderful designers.
    Spending hours observing as a piece goes from concept thru production, is utterly
    priceless. <BR> <BR>what are the differences anyway? Do roles and functions vary
    from firm to firm? perhaps it would help to know what the differences are, art
    director, designer? production artist? <BR> <BR>The bitch I&#39;ve seen in today&#39;s
    economy is that many employers want somebody who can do it all, not just have
    great ideas and be able to articulate them to staff but more importantly execute
    them better than just that 50% I know it&#39;s cost me several jobs... admitting
    that I&#39;m a concept person not a production person. I&#39;ve heard being an
    idea person but will always get you hired but have yet to experience it. '

    linked with Concordia U. and resources up the yahoo, support from DX &#40;Design
    Exchange&#41; and RGD/GDC. I was very jealous of George Brown&#39;s program when
    I graduated. They do have a thesis/portfolio year - 4th that you could prolly
    jump right into. The courses look yummy. I plan to go back and take it during
    the evenings just for fun.  <BR> <BR>I went to Algonquin in Ottawa - same feeling
    as Stuart&#39;s- not many taking it seriously and unfortunately there&#39;s only
    a few good profs. There is a fast-track program though run by Janet Menger. 6
    months. $6000 I think. She can make you think and teach you what you need. The
    3 year program useto be top-rated here - but I donno...I had to do alot of my
    own research for various feilds of interest the profs had no idea about &#40;and
    now they ask that I go back and talk to students, I really don&#39;t know THAT
    much, so I&#39;d be worried about their cirriculum&#41; strangely enough very
    few assignment pieces out of the 3 years made it into my portfolio. <BR> <BR>Other

    contact the Registered Graphic Designer&#39;s Association in that province to
    make sure the school is recognized, and/or you can ask them which institution
    will be best for you. You can consult www.gdc.net &#40;The Society of...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The Associations and Society grant the Accrediations up here - you&#39;ll
    have to take an exam with the board after your program. Canada&#39;s Designers

    RFP lists. So once your in your also covered under NAFTA to swing into the States. '
