  body: 'well, this is more related to the topic in the critic/logo thread, but what
    do you think: does a humanist fit the logo for a city which is 650 years old/young?

  body: 'Hmmm. Bringhurst says, &#39;Myriad, like Frutiger, is full of subtle and
    open geometric forms&#39;. In other words, not humanist.  <BR> <BR>When I compare
    the lower case of Frutiger and Myriad, Myriad is more humanist as Yves says. It
    is narrower, especially the a, and its round letters more oval, and less circular.
    It also has more modulation - the tapering of the ends of the c and e, etc. Sort
    of a humanist version of Frutiger.  <BR> <BR>But it has the one story g. Maybe
    other features that lead to Bringhurst&#39;s classification? Do any of you have
    any ideas about this? Why does Bringhurst say &#39;geometric&#39;? <BR> <BR>As
    to the appropriateness of the face, I think this depends on the goal of the logo.
    From what you say in the other thread, Lars, and the unfocused look of it, it
    looks like not enough thought has gone into what a logo for this city should look
    like.   '

  body: Well, the question is not if Myriad fits Oldenburg but rather if at least
    they could have used small Caps and solid kerning and spacing.  <BR>Anyway, Myriad
    is a rather humanis-looking typeface to me too, and so is Frutiger, so... both
    are good examples of humanist typefaces, much as Akzidenz/Helvetica are of Static
    and Futura and Beyer is for Geometric. I don
