  body: "Is it worth it to \"save handwriting\" by the efforts of some interested
    people continuing in each generation to practice calligraphy? Of course.\r\n\r\nIs
    it worth it to \"save handwriting\" by continuing to require endless generations
    of schoolchildren to endure the drudgery of being schooled in penmanship? No,
    a thousand times no.\r\n\r\nHowever, I <em>am</em> willing to require endless
    generations of schoolchildren to continue to be required to know how to at least
    do block lettering with a pencil when the electricity is off. Spencerian script
    with a fountain pen is right out, though.\r\n\r\nThere is so much each generation
    has to learn that it needs to survive that adding to that burden - the burden
    faced by every student, that is - to preserve tradition cannot be justified. Traditions
    of value can and do survive when only those who are interested cultivate them,
    without having to coerce everyone into the effort."

    that good-for-the-economy jobs.\r\nMeanwhile, what skills come in useful when
    we are not at work, which includes 25+ years of retirement?\r\nMaking things,
    exercising one\u2019s taste in decorating and dressing (for parties, not for work!)
    etc.\r\nAnd what, perish the thought, if there might even be jobs in the trades
    or humanities that require hand skills?\r\n\r\nI would also say that \u201Cgood
    for the economy\u201D jobs is a somewhat political definition.\r\nMan-jobs that
    f*ck the environment, more like.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s great to see Neville Brody taking
    this on:\r\nhttp://www.dezeen.com/2012/11/26/neville-brody-dandad-education-ebacc/\r\n\r\nSo
    I say, learning how to write nicely is absolutely worthwhile, and while we\u2019re
    at it, why not give the kids some music, art and exercise in the core curriculum?\r\n\r\nWhy
    are we here? For pleasure or performance?\r\nTo make our own mark on life, or
    stamp out a standardized template?\r\n\r\n"

    to be mastered, but as a subject of study in the context of art/cultural history.
    An introduction to the world's writing systems would be worthwhile too. Consider:
    this is one of the central technologies of civilisation, as well as a major aesthetic
    cultural achievement in many places, and the majority of people are taught nothing
    about it in school.\r\n\r\nIf individual students are inspired to want to practice
    penmanship, then they should be given opportunity and encouragement."

  body: "I agree almost completely John. I think a curriculum taught centered on modern
    global typography would greatly assist people in everyday job training, and drive
    some tiny but steady minority back to handwriting, perhaps with a greater and
    more enthused appreciation for the roots of everything word-oriented. \r\n\r\nCreate
    an educational watershed, where most people can go on to making better captions
    in their home media, reporting on the whales in print, or directing type at an
    e-publisher, which are  around where the new center lies, vs. tattoo art, calligraphy,
    or just pad after pad of handwriting\u2013 all noble pursuits, but no longer attractive
    enough to the gathering mass communicating by word.\r\n\r\nThis type-ed pie-in-the-sky
    goes along with thinking that fonts have/had to be a little smarter, and browsers
    just a little poorer:)"

  body: "<a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/blog/handwriting\">Obligatory</a> (theoatmeal.com)\r\n\r\nMy
    previous years of work in IT eroded my (never great) handwriting ability to the
    point of near uselessness.  Nowadays I periodically need to quickly jot down notes
    on paper, and I've pretty much lost the ability to do so... at least in a way
    that's both rapid and legible.  Block printing is quite unsuited to that task
    and is likely to end up even more illegible.  \r\n\r\nFor rapid, legible writing,
    joined-up handwriting is essential.  It doesn't have to be beautiful, or follow
    a rigidly proscribed form, but I think everybody needs to be able to use a serviceable
    \"business style\" hand.  I'm pretty upset that I can't do it anymore.  (I've
    been trying to studying the Palmer Method in my free time.)\r\n\r\nOTOH, teaching
    it as a static, historical \"art\" rather than as an essential life tool is pretty
    much futile."

  body: "It is a silly question. \r\n\r\nTrue, the emphasis on a perfect and conforming
    style of handwriting may go or already have gone by the wayside. That's evolution.
    Which in its self is neither good nor bad. People make pragmatic decisions all
    the time about where to devote their time and energy and the simple fact of the
    matter is that perfecting hand writing as a vital form of communication is not
    really all that important these days. My own hand writing (never any good) is
    now almost entirely restricted to notes I take almost entirely for my own consumption.
    More of a mnemonic devise that an attempt t communicate. So while, in my opinion,
    there is no fear of any imminent demise of hand writing (as in being able to write
    a quick note or two when the batteries are dead)  it probably won't be what it
    was when I was in public school... And thank God (er, technology) for that.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    I think it is safe to say that there has never been a time when the art of calligraphy
    was more advanced than now."

    able to write a quick note or two\r\n\r\nI agree, but based on several articles
    I've read, many young people have difficulty reading/writing cursive because they
    never use it. If that trend continues, future generations may admire the artistry
    of calligraphy but have difficulty actually reading cursive writing. In fact it's
    conceivable that at some point in the future that cursive is viewed as an archaic
    writing style that is unreadable to most folks."

  body: That may be true for deciphering handwriting, but surely there is a continuum
    of cursive forms in wide typographic use, from italic through handwriting fonts,
    that will preserve their legibility.

  body: That's a good point, Nick. I'd certainly agree about italic. I'm not as sure
    about cursive handwriting fonts, though. If future generations have trouble reading
    cursive, designers may gradually stop using those fonts.
