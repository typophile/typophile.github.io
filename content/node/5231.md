  body: As second stop, for Artchimp, you could take a look at Kitchenette in the
    Lunch Box set and maybe, International Palms from The Casino Buffet set, both
    at <a href="http://FontDiner.com/main.html" target=_top>Font Diner</a>. <BR>

  body: 'And try <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">Gotham</a>
    for the sans serif. It&#39;s not going to be an exact match, but it will fit the
    style. The Paramount logo might be using Trade Gothic Extended or something similar.
    The Artchimp one is probably using one of CSA&#39;s fonts like <a href="http://www.csaimages.com/results.asp?cat=font">Cylinder</a>.
    Hope that helps. '
