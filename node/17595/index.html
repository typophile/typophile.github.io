<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Dear forum members,
i was asking myself whether it is necessary to keep the overall width of the single caracters, when they are combined to a ligature. So, if "f" has x width, and "i" y width, does the width of the fi-ligature have to be x+y or can it be narrower?
Pro same width: character combinations can be replaced by ligs without reflowing the text
Contra same width: ligs appear to be too wide sometimes
Adobe seems to go the way to make ligs narrower than single chars. What about other foundries?
Thanks for your answers

<div class=commentbody>It seems like it would depend almost completely on the face. For instance the color and the line weight, would affect the way the spacing of the ligatures would look and fit in. And if you did want a universal rule, ligatures should be a little narrower, because they were created to compensate for the extra space the single letters left, in lead. </div>

<div class=commentbody>The more enclosed a white space, the larger it appears to be, so ligatures should be actually narrower for optical equality (if that's what you want, which you probably should if you're representing two or more characters, rather than joining two or more glyphs to represent one character). Van Krimpen sometimes went further, to no very good end.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As Julianene said, the norm is that ligs take up less space than the single letters. This may also have been a function of fitting characters on a line in setting lead type. Today, we have no hard boundaries with digital type and kerning and contextual alts have made the job easier for typesetting pros. Perhaps then today, the width of ligs is more about better matching of letter spaces than fitting to a line. I don't know what value there would be in an exact match to the separated glyphs, what reads best and then looks best seems more important.

<div class=commentbody>Typically, the ligatures take up less space. One of the things that might be a goal in the design of the ligatures is to maintain the visual rhythm of vertical stems in text. Once you've finished spacing the typeface, come back to the ligatures and see how they look in text. Also check what the spacing is of the lowercase el or i. One possible rule of thumb is that the space between the two stems in the fi or fl ligature should be equivalent to the space between two els or two i's.
Of course, the eye is the ultimate arbiter. That rule of thumb is most likely to lead one astray in the heaviest weights of a monoline sans serif....

<div class=commentbody>Thomas,
I have been using the negative space of the lc "n" as a guide for ti and fi ligs space because they are enclosed on 3 sides like an "n". I still tinker afterwards with the good old eyeball as well.

<div class=commentbody>"does the width of the fi-ligature have to be x+y or can it be narrower?"
ChrisL's right. The counter of the fi is the same or slightly less than the counter of the n. The less the result of a more square (open) counter that can be slightly compressed to attain the same visual impact of n. fl then'd be slightly less in counter, slightly more right side bearing, and etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The intersting thing is: even though one might not know about a specific principle, the eye does the right thing anyway.
I couldn't tell why they looked too wide, but they did. I made them narrower, and tada... they were quite excactly the counter of the "n", when checked afterwards.
Conclusion: Trust the eye.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm throwing my lot in with the "depends" crowd.
I have made fonts where ligatures were desirable or simply sexy, and I have also made fonts where the design not only doesn't require the fi and fl ligatures, but they look odd, so I simply make glyphs which are the two glyphs side-by-side, and therefor the same width as the two glyphs together.
There are two kinds of ligatures in the digital era: necessary and discretionary. The first are a solution to a problem posed by the design of the glyphs; a long-teardrop-terminal "f" for example. The latter are ligatures created by the designer to amuse themselves, recreate a historical effect, answer a request, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the first priority is to try and make the f - i combination work without a ligature or kerning. This is because many users do not employ ligatures or kerning.
The same is true for the f - l/b/h/k combinations.
The f - ? combination is important for the same reason.

<div class=commentbody>Have you had the chance to take a look at the Bram de Does Trinité? Digital type (also)has this kind of characteristic: It can be drawn to overlap letters. In the specific case of Trinité, the 'f' has been drawn promiscously, in relation to pairs. of letters. The 'i' tip becomes the ending of the 'f', and they work as an assembly. This can give another perspective of the problem. On the other hand, there are typefaces drawn with the 'lead boundaries', so the 'f' cannot enter the space of other letters. That achieves the question: spacing or merely aestetics? Instead of two pieces of lead, we can have only one. Though, the spacing subject remains.
Perhaps I'm radical, but I no longer think of the group 'fi' as two letters, but as one solo graphic symbol. With the use and abuse of the negative tracking, this leaves an issue to consider, doesn't it?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Abuse of negative tracking is, sadly, something type designers cannot change. The people who insist on group-grope typography obviously don't have the sensibility to see the error of their ways. I think we have to concentrate our design on people who are not trying to use type as a new way to play Twister.

<div class=commentbody>:D that's the second time you say that dezcom! The first time you said :"nice winkly face, seml" So you really like it. Let's just say I had a bodoni smile that day.;)
You made me think of one important thing: spacing in justification. I think only the quest for the perfect column brings up issues like that. I hate to change the rhythm of text an I believe text should only be justified if the length of the line is superior to 20picas? Otherwise, as a good latin text composer, i would ragg right ;) Computers brought the negative leading, but sometimes I think a virus should be created, in order to make programs like Quark or InDesign, but Word at most respect the "laws of the lead". Perhaps it would improve something? :)</div>
