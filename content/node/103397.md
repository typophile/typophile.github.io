  on MS Word here comes the problem. I know MS Word isn't the best typographic program
  but there are some people that use it and deserve quality on fonts.\r\nThe problem
  happen only in the thinnest style and consist in the following:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Problema

  the character shapes and the real proportions aren't showed.\r\n\r\nIf anybody can
  help me I apreciate it very much.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nManuel\r\n"

    than 250, apparently to prevent\u2026 oh, who cares. That\u2019s just what it
    does, making values below 250 useless. Graphics apps tend to use their own font
    rendering system, so are not affected."
