  I can find, it's also used on the posters for Chicago on the underground system
  in London.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nRob"

  body: "Yes, that's what they've done, and very well.\r\n\r\nI have hunted through
    my Script Guide and several of the books I have and I can't find this script (not
    even among photo-lettering scripts). It seems closest to <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=23&subpage=viewfonts\">House
    Script</a> from the Sign Painter package.\r\n\r\nYou might expect it to be in
    some of the Bluemlein Scripts that Alejandro Paul has been reviving for Veer,
    but it's not any that I have collected, as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yeah I did look on Veer as I know they have a large number of scripts. It
    is truly stunning when you see it up large. The design was created by a company
    called SpotCo in NYC guess I could email them, probably had it commissioned.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help\r\n\r\nRob"
