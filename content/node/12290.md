  body: "I am just new to fontlab and just starting to working on my spacing, so this
    topic also interests me.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the measurement line is to
    help you space your sidebearings correctly. You can move it up and down and whereever
    it falls on the glyph on both sides of it it will measure out to the sidebars.
    So if you had a flat side and a fat side like a capital H, you could give it equal
    distance on either side right in the glyph editing window without going into the
    metrics (although i find it easier here)\x03\r\n\r\nMaybe there is more to it,
    i am not sure, but looking forward the responses from others :)"

  body: "That's basically correct, Thomas. I actually invented the measuring line
    and persuaded Yuri to implement it, so I guess people can blame me if they don't
    like it. The idea though is to provide a means to obtain and manipulate metrics
    based on distance from stems and bowls rather than from extremes. So, for instance,
    if you have a lovely oldstyle typeface with lots of irregularities such as serifs
    of varying lengths, the measuring line is extremely useful, because you can ensure
    even spacing of vertical stems relative to each other without having to take into
    account the difference in serif length when setting sidebearings. Similarly, if
    you have bowls with slightly different curvature, giving them all the same sidebearing
    value won't necessarily produce even spacing. But if you set the measuring line
    at around half the x-height, or just slightly higher, and then set the measuring
    line to sidebearing distance to be the same for all bowls of the same height you
    will generally find the spacing to be more even.\r\n\r\nSidebearings, as a measurement
    from the left and right extremes of a glyph, are a mechanical setting, which has
    nothing to do with how one actually spaces letters, which has to do with the relationships
    of white space between stems and bowls. Being able to measure off the stems and
    bowls directly is very helpful.\r\n\r\nNote that in FL Studio 5, the height of
    the measuring line is saved with the VFB file, which means that it won't keep
    jumping back to 300 units high every time you re-open FontLab. I generally set
    the measuring line relative to the x-height, for a Latin typeface, and lock it
    in that position throughout development, using it extensively for spacing. The
    only time I'll shift it is if I want to use it specifically for spacing uppercase
    letters."

  body: "A couple of additonal comments:\r\n\r\nI make most use of the measuring line
    within the metrics window, where you can turn it on and set values relative to
    stems and bowls just as you would relative to extremes.\r\n\r\nNote that in the
    Glyph Properties panel, two sets of horizontal metrics are shown for the selected
    or open glyph: actual sidebearings from extremes and also sidebearings at the
    measuring line height."

    italic spacing in shape.
