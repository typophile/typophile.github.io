  found on the T Magazine website and in the print editions as a sub-header and occasionally
  header. Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nNY Times won't allow copying of
  images, so I only have links. And of the pages have it at the top, labeled \"Women's
  Fashion\", \"Men's Fashion\", \"Design\", \"Travel\", etc.\r\n\r\nTry [[http://www.nytimes.com/pages/t-magazine/mens-fashion/index.html|here]]\r\nOr
  [[http://www.nytimes.com/pages/t-magazine/travel/index.html|here]]\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much."

    'In June 2009, Berton Hasebe drew Karl, a hairline blackletter display type, exclusively
    for T, the New York Times Style Magazine. Karl is based on NYT Fraktur originally
    drawn by Matthew Carter.'\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Commercial-Type/194376846119"

  body: 'Update:  Commercial Type''s "Marian Black" is significantly different than
    Karl-Hairline, the font that''s still being used by the New York Times T-magazine.
    Marian Black is more of a Fraktur, and shares little with Karl-Hairline other
    than a general blackletter-like appearance.'
