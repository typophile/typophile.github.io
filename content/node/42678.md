  I noticed that at the Veer site when I look up my OpenType fonts\u2014 either Shoebop
  or Chai Tea, when I view the character page that shows the glyphs included they
  are all scrambled. My PS fonts are in fine order, but the OT fonts are all that
  way. I would show a sample, but can't get a screen grab from the page. here is a
  link: \r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000247#characters
  \ \r\n\r\nIs there some sort of glyph mapping or unicode listing I'm not aware of?
  \ I've only been working with OpenType for about a year and have been learning on
  my own. I don't do any python scripting or such, but am getting pretty comfortable
  with feature code. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp"

  body: This happened to me at myfonts but I'm not sure what I did to remedy it. Are
    you in codepages mode when you generate your opentype font? Maybe it has something
    to do with the index. Go into index mode and see how that looks. -Jess

  body: "That is easily fixed, no problem.\r\n\r\nYou have to sort the glyphs in FontLab
    before generating your font. You can sort your glyphs in a couple of different
    ways, by namne, unicode or encoding.\r\nIf not sorted, they will end up in an
    order that is based on when each glyphs was created, in which order they were
    created, that is.\r\n\r\nIn index-mode you can also drag glyphs manually if you
    want."

    when you wish to manually insert them with Chai Tea\u2026 :=)\r\nI used it for
    a project where I work, and if you have not already done so, I suggest to do an
    update at MyFonts to offer a new version with the glyphs sorted in Index mode\u2026"
