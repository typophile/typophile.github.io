  similar to Font Bureau\u2019s Headline Showings (In their Type Specimens Third Edition
  book and on their website). I was wondering where one would get the source material
  (for the copy). Is there a random phrase or headline generator or do you just browse
  newspapers/magazines? The design is going well its just the search for the text
  to use that is the most time-consuming.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/images/specimen/splash/farnham.gif\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "The Font Bureau folks are experts at the kind of whimsical narrative text
    that has been used in type specimens for decades. It definitely requires some
    imagination. I don't think any of that kind of specimen text is copied from headlines;
    at most some of it could be inspired by current events or personal stories.\r\n\r\nDepending
    on the style of type you are showing, you might prepare some headlines that seem
    appropriate to the design. House Industries also devise elaborate logos and headlines
    to show their display types. I think it is very useful for designers who might
    like to spec the type but need to see how it performs. Again, if the tone or content
    of the text is sympathetic to the typeface, all the better. If you have a text
    typeface to show, it might be better (easier) to get permission to reprint part
    of an existing story or book. See Adobe's specimen books for more examples. "

  body: "Writing type specimen copy is one of the greatest joys in creating type.
    It's typographic poetry. Like Carl said, use words that feel like the typeface
    and show off the face's most distinctive glyphs.\r\n\r\nAs for more models (of
    what to do or avoid), I've done some specimen posters for <a href=\"http://macrhino.com/\">MAC
    Rhino</a> and mini specimens for the QBN Typecase at <a href=\"http://www.newstoday.com\">Newstoday</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Christian Schwartz, who is responsible for many of those posters at Font Bureau
    has more at <a href=\"http://orangeitalic.com/type.shtml\">Orange Italic</a>."
