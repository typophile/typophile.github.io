  body: Aaron, is this just a logo, or a full typeface idea? If it is a full typeface
    idea, we should see more characters. That would help us help you more.

  body: I see promise in that B. I would first say you do need to finesse your beziers
    a bit more. Something like this deserves crisp and articulate curves and strokes.

  body: "this project was on hold for a while, but i've been working on it again for
    the last few days... sure could use some critique. i've had quite a bit of trouble--both
    with the RAS letter combination, and with making the mark bold (it started off
    very light). any advice from the experts out there is greatly appreciated... does
    it just totally suck? i've looked at it so long now i can't tell.\r\n\r\n/aaron\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brass_Bell.jpg]"
