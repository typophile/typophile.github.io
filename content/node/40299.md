  body: Unicode may be the most complete list of written symbols around, but its organization
    doesn't make for easy human browsing.  Robert Bringhurst's "Working Alphabet",
    Appendix A in his <em>Elements of Typographic Style</em>, is limited to Roman,
    Greek, Cyrillic, and the International Phonetic Alphabet, but it's much easier
    to peruse.
