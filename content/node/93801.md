  and loved the font used for some of the titles.\r\n\r\nI've attached an example
  and you can also see the font at the 1:48-2:00 mark of the trailer here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUdM9vrCbow&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated! \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    I've found is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gothic-rr/bold-condensed/|RR
    Gothic Condensed Bold]] (or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/railroad-gothic-rr/|Railroad
    Gothic]]), quite the same insconsistency in letters with a very close /A and /G
    (spur with oblique bottom left part) but not distressed like your sample. There's
    also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-kipp/|FF Kipp]], distressed but
    the overall design is far less similar.\r\nMore similars, some distressed, some
    not: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/thunderhouse/|Thunderhouse]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/toronto-gothic/|Toronto
