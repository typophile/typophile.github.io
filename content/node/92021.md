  kerning right in a logo. Im a web designer by trade and come from Iceland where
  everyone is pretty much a generalist. I would be very thankful if you nice people
  would help me make the kerning in this logo better.\r\n\r\nMy eye tells me this
  is close but I'm not too sure about the \"ke\" pair at the end. What do you guys
  think?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: Generalist is someone who has a wide range of knowledge and skills, as opposed
    to a specialist. Its in part because we are so few and the companies small, we
    are forced to put on more hats that is required in other cultures.

  body: "Overall too tight. The \"ake\" is way too tight. The \"ct\" is too loose.
    And \"electric\" is too light since it might might end up quite small sometimes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Agree with what others have posted, 're' is too tight, as is 'ak' in relation
    to 'ma'. For me, the 'ke' at the end is still a problem, it looks like you've
    set 'remake' quite tightly, but you might want to try it looser because the 'ke'
    being so tight just doesn't work, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAlso agree that there
    might be a problem with 'electric' once you scale the logo down, as it will start
    to get very small. And the kerning between the c and t is a little loose at the
    moment. It looks a little like it says 'elec tric'.\r\n\r\nHope that helps, actually
    think it's not far from being a good logo."

  body: That is a weird looking letter k to be honest. It might look better without
    the extension that connects the body to the "arm" and "leg".

  body: "I agree with hrant, the spacing in general is a bit too tight. When you reduce
    this to smaller sizes you may lose spacing between letters entirely. \r\n\r\nI'd
    increase the space evenly in remake, and perhaps an extra pixel or two between
    \"ak\". On electric, the \"t\" should be nudged a bit to the left, and \"ele\"
    should be moved over a little bit (an extra pixel)."
