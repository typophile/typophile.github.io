body: Hi everyone, I am hoping someone can help me to identify the font used in my
  iPhone app logo.  I had my hard drive crash a couple of weeks ago and lost everything.  I
  had a backup of the PSD I used to create the logo, but the font was missing and
  for the life of my cannot figure out which one was used.  I tried looking in Photoshop
  for the missing font, but it doesn't seem to show.  Can anyone point me in the right
  direction?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/icon square big_5433.png]
