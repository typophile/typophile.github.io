  body: I&#39;ve searched Veer, PSY/OPS and T-26 with no luck. Even tried &#40;ugh!&#41;
    What The Font -- hey I was looking for help wherever I could find it -- but it
    didn&#39;t find anything close. <BR> <BR>This looks like the lettering you make
    with one of those template lettering systems like the LeRoy gadgets. The absolutely
    monotone strokes with rounded ends looks just like a pen lettering system output.
