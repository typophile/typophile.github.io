    body: Monotype has a version of Garamond, one weight with italic, just for display.
      It would work superbly for you.

    maybe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FB.106473.0.0\">Spira</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=NS.120662.0.0\">Nicholas</a>
    will work.\r\n\r\nCan you describe what you mean by \"angular\"?"

      no perectly horizontal or vertical lines (everything has a slight curve to it)...
      I'm wondering if anyone has done a version where this is not the case....\r\n"

    from Adobe or <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=130">Vendetta</a> from

    Garamont</a>, which is nearly identical to the display sizes of ATF Garamond,
    an old favorite of mine.

      see these things to know what works

    idea, just wondering how close it would push the face to say another more flat-footed
    Old Style like Palatino or gasp...Times New Roman. I've always seen Garamond as
    the friendly neighbor that's easy going with no sharp edges is all."

  body: Not sure about the angular serifs, but Fountain's <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/monteverdi.asp">Monteverdi</a>
    is a nice take on the Garamond "style" with some great ligatures. It's also intended
    for larger sizes.

  body: "Depends on your intended use. For a more rustic look, I would definitely
    go for Tiro's; for clean-cut, Adobe Garamond Pro Titling.\r\n\r\nMonotype Garamond
    is not of his design but of Granjon's. It works superbly in larger sizes, though;
    in fact, its one of those faces that can sparkle in both texts and titles.\r\n\r\nBut
    I agree, its italic is yummy."
