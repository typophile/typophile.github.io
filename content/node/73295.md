body: "I overhalled my Mac os 10.4.11 system. Now whenever I go into quark or illustrator
  or something I get this message when I start up the program:\r\n\"Error loading
  suitcase fusion xt   Can not locate the \"extensis plugins\" framework. Please re-install
  the suitcase fusion plug-in and then re-start the application.\r\n\r\nSounds easy.
  But i have no idea where my Suitcase disk is. Where would I be able to download
  this and where do I put it on my mac once I do. I design I am a horrible troubleshooter
  \r\nthx in advance"

  body: "Upgrading or reinstalling your system software shouldn't have any affect
    on the plug-ins for Quark, Illustrator, etc as those are not stored in the System
    folder. \r\n\r\nI think it's more likely that you just need to upgrade Suitcase
    to work with your new system software. Sometimes these upgrades are free downloads.
    Go to the Extensis support area.\r\n\r\n"
