People often mix up @font-face, EOT and "raw fonts".  @font-face is the general technology; EOT, TTF, OTF, SVG and so on are possible formats which can work with @font-face depending on the browser support. (Similar to GIF/JPG/PNG and the IMG tag)

The line is hard to draw. You could also built an EOT font without URL-binding and compression and obfuscate a "raw" font, so it's not really raw any more ...
And it's getting more complicated now that new formats are being proposed. Some more information:

Certainly talk of @font-face support needs to carry this caveat, that different font formats are required to display @font-face linked fonts in different browsers. But in terms of recognising @font-face in CSS and doing <em>something</em> with that information, one can say that all these browsers support it.

Services like Typotheque's, Typekit and Kernest serve different file formats to different browsers as appropriate, while trying to provide some measure of server-side or in-font obfuscation to naked font data to make it uninstallable on desktop systems. So they can claim to support ‘95% of all browsers in use’ even though those browsers support @font-face in different ways.

From a type foundry perspective, considering whether to sign up for any of these services, a key question is whether the methods of obfuscation of naked font data provided are sufficient. You probably also want to make sure that your web font license and your contract agreement with these service providers specifies that such methods are a requirement, i.e. that naked font data should not be served without such measures.</div>

So far, the only pressure I've seen from web designers/authors has been on the other browsers to support EOT Lite, because it is the only format that offers a significant measure of backwards compatibility with well over 50% of browsers in current use.

And I think the chances of MS supporting raw linking are now close to nil.

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, I understand this is indeed confusing, especially since Internet Explorer has supported @font-face for a very long time, but very few people took advantage of this. But in a way, this is not so much different from another basic HTML code:  &lt;img src="url" /&gt;

Not every browser supports all image formats (e.g. PNG, BMP), the designer has to choose the format that is best for the purposes. Hopefully, we'll soon have one font format that works in all browsers, so we don't have to specify two or more* font formats per single web page.

* It is a fact that right now, we deliver subsetted and obfuscated TTF for some browsers, and the same font wrapped in EOT for other browsers. But because we aim for multilingual support, we realise that even this may not be enough, as Apple requires AAT fonts for correct shaping of some non-Latin scripts. I am just playing with Devanagari fonts, and while on Windows this sample (http://www.typotheque.com/hindi.html) is rendered correctly in all browsers, on Mac the conjuncts are not correctly rendered. The sample is in fact Nepalese, not Hindi.</div>
