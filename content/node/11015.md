  body: Andy , <BR> <BR>I do not know if you have seen it yet, but TypeCon <BR>has
    room rate info up for the Radisson Plaza now.  <BR>It is where the conference
    is. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typecon2003.com/hotel.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.typecon2003.com/hotel.cfm</a>
    <BR> <BR>At $99 per night I am finding a it bargain myself. <BR>For $119 you even
    get Continental Breakfast  <BR>and evening cocktails! That&#39;s good for me!
    <BR> <BR>If you can find someone to room with thats just  <BR>$50 each. Way worth
    it to just roll out of bed, stumble <BR>down a few stairs and start thinking about
    type. <BR> <BR>Good luck, see you there. <BR> <BR>-Sean MIchael

  body: Good thread! We should move it to the SOTA special interest group. We can
    set it up as a thread where people can ask to share rooms or carpool. <BR> <BR>$99
    a night is a great deal for such a nice hotel in downtown Minneapolis. And the
    $119 upgraded room is also really good &#40;although you will get a free continental
    breakfast, coffee, and snacks Fri-Sun as part of TypeCon admission!&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Do try to grab a roomie and stay in the conference hotel if at all possible,
    it&#39;s one of the best ways to stay tuned in and do a little informal networking.
    And getting to all the other venues for workshops and evening events is really
    quick and easy from the hotel.  <BR> <BR>Minneapolis is a very cool place, and
    I will get some local folks to post info about must-see sights in the SOTA special
    interest group here.
