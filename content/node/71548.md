  to do letterpress printing in a cold metal shop but I haven't retained this datum.
  The one lettepress printer I asked so far didn't know the answer.\r\n\r\nMost type
  is cast out of a lead alloy that's made with tin and antimony.\r\n\r\nAre the actual
  strips of leading made out of the same metal, or pure lead?\r\n\r\nI'm guessing
  they were pure lead, because I remember them being much softer than pieces of type
  (and hence easier to bend and cut). \r\n\r\n"

  body: "As far as my knowledge reaches, the composition of leading could vary as
    much as the composition of the sorts themselves. Making it pure lead would make
    it easier to cut, but it would also be easier to accidentally bend in the long
    strips, and it would be much heavier than if it were mixed.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it
    depended on the specific letterpress. Leading wouldn't really need any \"harder\"
    metals as it doesn't receive much eroding over time, so maybe many left out other
    metals as they were more costly."

  body: "Matthew \u2014 I checked a few references I have here and couldn\u2019t find
    specific information about type metal for leads. The 1923 ATF catalogue offers
    1-point leads in brass (presumably, you want 1-point leads a bit harder) and the
    rest in \u201Cmetal,\u201D without elaboration.\r\n\r\nYou should try contacting
    Theo Rehak. He would undoubtedly know, or be able to give a very educated guess.
    <a href=\"http://nicksherman.com\">Nick Sherman</a> might have contact information
    for Rehak. Nick\u2019s helping a couple guys who are working with Theo to revitalize
    the Dale Guild Type Foundry (a true metal foundry, not just in name).\r\n"

    metals for different thicknesses was also intended to make identification by the
    compositor easier, I think."

  body: That was certainly true of spacing matter (coppers, brasses, thins, and thicks).
    Not sure if the same principle applied to leads. Maybe so.

  body: "Leading and other strip materials for letterpress are generally cast from
    an alloy that has a higher percentage of lead, so is cheaper to buy, usually about
    the same alloy as what was used for Linotype metal (since Linotype slugs were
    generally printed from once and then melted down to recast; they didn't need to
    be hard for repeated reuse). \r\n\r\nI have never seen 1 pt. brass leads - too
    expensive! It's very easy to tell the difference between 1 pt. and 2 pt. leads
    when you have them in hand. \r\n\r\nThe 1 and 2 pt. leads will flex just because
    they are long and thin compared to lead type. A 6 pt. slug of the same length
    will not noticeably flex."

  body: "As far as I remember from my Art School days when we used loose type, the
    thinner ones were made of brass and quite delicate. \r\n\r\nThicker ones of a
    kind of light metal (might have been an aluminum alloy) and the even thicker ones,
    including the material to lock up the composition were made of an ironlike metal
    where a lot of hollow interior shapes were used to lighten the weight of these
    elements.\r\n\r\nI have one of the medium (alu?) ones somewhere, but I guess having
    that tested for its composition is out of my reach\u2026"

    machining or extruding characteristics, resistance to corrosion or reduced cost,
    it will almost certainly be an alloy which may or may not have a noticeably different
    weight but for the volume of metal you have, the difference would be within a
    rounding error.\r\n"
