It is not yet complete, but I'd like to get the opinions of the people on this forum.  There seem to be a lot of knowledgeable and/or opinionated folks here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For this font (tentatively titled Metron), I wanted to create an attractive, slightly futuristic sans serif typeface for display, corporate logos, and short lengths of text.  I also wanted to stay away from the super-geometric look that makes so many fonts gimmicky and unreadable.  The capitals were designed first, with the lowercase something of an afterthought (and still unfinished). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The typeface was built around a sketch I made of an uppercase M.  I'm happy with it so far, but the N and the 7 have been problematic.  Also note that I haven't done any kerning yet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I welcome any help I can get.  Go ahead and be as nitpicky as you want.  I'll offer free copies (once it's done) to anyone who posts something helpful here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's a bit like Bronzo as a grown-up: much smoother, but with some new individualistic traits. I like how there's enough organicity to give it a much richer character than something entirely mechanical; and it's not formally straight-laced, which is great (like the killer divergence between the UC &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;). The only UC glyphs that bug me are the &quot;D&quot; (too square), and the &quot;Q&quot;: do something drastic with it, although since the font is so nice in all-caps I wouldn't ruin the line with a strong tail (except maybe as an alternate), so do something inside the bowl instead, like maybe cut straight from the bottom-left of the bowl to the (inside) top-left of the tail? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lc isn't nearly as convincing. For one thing, I think this design needs body, so make the xheight as large as you can. The &quot;m&quot; is great and the &quot;ae&quot; is smart, but the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are especially weak. The numerals are really nice, except the &quot;4&quot; needs more presence. The peculiars: try a single bar on the Dollar and Yen; lower and lengthen them (towards the inside) in the Euro. The &quot;?&quot; needs more presence too. The rest are pretty nice! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. This design needs at least one darker weight. But don't bother with an italic. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The rounded corners are a nice professional touch. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. The name is right on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go all the way with it! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks folks.  I've never seen Bronzo, and I'll refrain from looking at it now so as not to pollute my own intuitions here.  I'll take all your comments into account for version 0.2. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bj harvey: thanks for rectumfying your quarrel that that Armenian troublemaker.

You're right, I've been too conservative with the x-height.  Your comment on a darker weight is interesting, because I designed this font on paper for a much heavier weight, but thought it would be easier to start light and make the heavier afterwards. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't plan on an italic, but I'd like to do other character sets. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rounded corners were inspired by FS Albert.

		<div class="commentbody">Pretty nice! The lc is improving fast. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The biggest problem to me is an uncomfortable conflict between round and flat. For example compare the lc &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. This is less obvious in the UC as a whole, for some reason. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other &quot;global&quot; thing that bugs me is optical: at smaller sizes especially, things like the descender of the lc &quot;g&quot; and the top of the counter of the numeral &quot;6&quot; seem to be &quot;splaying&quot; at uneasy angles, disturbing the otherwise wonderful serenity of this design. It's an illusion, and since this is a display face you might just ignore it; or there might be a trick (like turning in the last tip of the flat part) that might help. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some glyph-specific stuff: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Consider giving the UC &quot;I&quot; bars. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I know the UC &quot;M&quot; is one of your &quot;mother glyphs&quot; here, but I think it needs a small mod: take the middle &quot;v&quot; lower. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The UC &quot;Q&quot; still needs work: the inside is a little bit too strong now; the bottom-right is messy: what about this - make the corner a total 90-degree angle, and the &quot;tail&quot; go into it. You'll need some optical compensation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The UC &quot;X&quot; seems a bit too smooth. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The diagonal of the UC &quot;Z&quot; is too wavy. Make it more like the &quot;X&quot; - three clear segments connected with abrupt curves. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Lower the bar of the lc &quot;e&quot; a bit. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The &quot;f&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are malformed. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- That lc &quot;r&quot; is going to be a spacing fiasco. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I think the lc &quot;t&quot; does need a curl. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The BP currency is strange. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keep it up! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the original Q is way better. just my opinion, but i couldn't let it go. the second X is more distinct as well. although by itself the m is interesting, it does seem a little out of place with the middle stroke breaking the baseline. i like both S's, but the original was making my day. nice and squareish, but not square. for the t, maybe a tiny little tail ala din or meta. the first one was stronger than the second. the 3 seems a little top heavy to me. maybe a little assymetry would help. v.0.2 &quot;?&quot; is good. the original S and B were great. i think that's the way to go. you can see how personal preference shows up in these critiques. interesting, eh? oh yeah&hellip; the counter in the first D was bowing the vertical stroke inward. the second D is much more succesful. also, the G stands out, but not in a good way. something to do with hrant's &quot;round vs flat&quot;* issue. anyway, time for church. i look forward to seeing more of this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*copyright hhp</div>

I'm still grateful to be able to draw on the instincts of experienced type designers, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've resolved the round-vs-flat conflict by making the lowercase letters all roundish on top.
