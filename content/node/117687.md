  a quick search, then passed it off to me, I've been searching and I've had no luck.
  I'm hoping someone on here has better luck than me, I figured it was a simple find,
  but, wow there's so many fonts out there. Thanks in advanced for any help. \r\n\r\n**
  Just in case I didn't get the upload right, here's the website. It's the thin black
  swirled font \"alk of the town\": http://www.talkofthetownatlanta.com/\r\n"
