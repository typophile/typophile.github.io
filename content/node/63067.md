  Can anyone confirm if this a common script or if it might be available for purchase?
  \r\n\r\nI thank you in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rumble88_6314.jpg]"

    Script]] with a customized R. In fact, the two R's seem a bit different in their

    if you please , but is there a name for those flair-like designs around the title?
    Do you think perhaps they might have been hand drawn , or was there ever a typeface
    set that contained \"flairs\" , so to speak? \r\n\r\nAgain , thank you. "
