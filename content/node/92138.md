  body: What in the world is an "English" typeface?  You mean the copies people made
    of Jenson's work?  Or the typefaces based on the textura or German blackletter?  (that
    is to say, none of those are truly "English") And who in the world would know
    the difference besides maybe some of us here? Certainly not anyone's clients.  Just
    throw a Union Jack on the page somewhere.  Bingo, now its English.

    by Monotype's Victor Lardent in 1931 under the direction of Stanley Morison. \r\nWas
    Gill Sans ruled out for design reasons, or in protest of Eric Gill's debauched
    private life? If you can use something else by Gill, Perpetua (from the late 1920s)
    is very nice. It, too, was designed at the instigation of Stanley Morison."
