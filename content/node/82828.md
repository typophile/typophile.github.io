  With our designer we wrote this draft.\r\nCoarse papers are used mainly for our
  books.\r\n\r\nWith sans we would like something in the line of Agenda Regular, but
  it remind me something of the old Britain superb school (g, a) with Johnston and
  Gill.\r\nPerhaps something more \xABmodern\xBB, just a little less ornamented although
  similar in beauty and rythm.\r\n\r\nFor the serif, we are not sure with the new
  Bembo recutt as in this forum the opinions were fifty/fifty, and some overused tendency
  was mentioned.\r\nOf course our daily leader is Minion (with the marvelous Erhhardt
  in paralell) but we want a new one. We saw the fantastic Collis and Ruse by the
  gifted Noordzij's but they are overpriced 400% with our budget. \r\n(Trinit\xE9
  is a must but time and readers perhaps want something different.)\r\n\r\nAdobe Text
  sounds good (a mix of Minions, Bembos, Jenson, etc) but we are afraid this is a
  font Adobe will give as a plus with software purchasing and the investment could
  be just a loss...\r\nWe checked the dutch foundries but what about the rest of Europe?"

  body: Paula, an indication of your budget could be useful - there are many contemporary
    serif (and sans to pair with) typefaces that could work well in book environment,
    and knowing - approximately - how much you may spend could be a starting point.
    Moreover, how much do you want to differ from Minion? Are you after an historically
    inspired font or a more original interpretation?

  body: "Cycles is an really great typeface, I have to say I am very content with
    it. I obtained it, when it was still under the normal license and it is to me
    a really perfect balanced serif font for extended text. It has a classic, old
    style inspired, appearance, a reasonable proportioned x-height, and the letters
    seem to harmonize well on a page. It does not have any too fancy features, as
    some old-style revivals or interpretations have (Garamond Premiere, Arno for example
    \u2013 they are beautiful, but a different category). Yet it is not as cold and
    sterile as some other typefaces are, like Times New Roman or according to some
    maybe even Sabon. I have to say I find it hard to find a classic looking text-face
    that would compete. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, I can only say that I have no experience
    how any font would behave in a professional environment, as I am not working in
    such. Although I printed with Cycles in ink, laser and offset, I am not the person
    who could evaluate its performance in a way that would matter to you. \r\n\r\nPersonally
    I like as well: [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=35|Andron]]
    (which has similar qualities to the mentioned cycles, but an almost universal
    character-set, on the other hand no optical sizing variations, like cycles), [[http://www.commercialtype.com/typefaces/lyon/lyon_text|Lyon]],
    [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/Rawlinson2|Rawlinson]] and [[http://www.type-together.com/Edita|Edita]].
    All are a bit wider set than Minion, which I find a tad to condensed and tight.
    \r\n\r\nIf you publish as well in the German, Swedish, Brasilian or other language
    markets with diacritic marks, then have a look at this issue before you decide
    on a typeface:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/40439\r\nThe before mentioned typefaces
    in my post all avoid this problem. \r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure what you are looking for, but as you mention the new Bembo,
    I assume that's Bembo book, you might have a look at [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams
    Caslon Text]]. It is also intended to capture the look of a classic metal font,
    in this case the \"dark but open\" look that Caslon, well printed in metal, had.
    I just recently went through the exercise of comparing it and Minion as far as
    economy. I was pleasantly surprised that used somewhat smaller size, it could
    match Minion in economy. Because it is a little wider, lighter, and a little looser
    spaced, it is equally as readable at the smaller size\u2014well, more readable,
    but I am prejudiced. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a clean and modern look, I
    am also a huge fan of Whitman. "
