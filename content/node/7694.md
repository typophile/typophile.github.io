  on pixel fonts for three days now, and am getting a bit punchy. <BR> <BR>Interesting
  to me sometimes, how one font will jump out of a single letter from another font:
  <BR> <BR>A. Trixie. I&#39;ve been tinkering with this idea for months. Different
  sized pixels within a letter form. <BR> <BR>B. I wanted to spread out the letters
  with a better balance of little pixels to big pixels. The S and Z led the way, and
  ended up leading me to an interesting P and R. <BR> <BR>C. I decided to follow the
  P and R and see where it would take me. I thought it might make for an interesting
  unicase. the p and q looked okay. the b and d looked terrible. but they led me to
  consider a five pixel wide grid instead of a seven-wide. <BR> <BR>D. The lower case
  set just jumped right out of my mouse. The upper case isn&#39;t as good, but I felt
  good about getting an UC regardless. <BR> <BR>E. Woo-hoo! A bold works too! &#40;three
  days and counting, remember?&#41; <BR> <BR>F. WOW! Italics works too! <BR> <BR>
  <BR>Ah, well, it&#39;s fun pushing pixels anyway. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53571.gif"

  body: "I've selected this design for the \"Bitmap Display/Script\" category in the
    first <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14678\">Critique Thursday</a> because
    I think it is a great experiment.\r\n\r\nIt goes to show that, maybe in some display
    cases, legibility isn't really everything\u2026\r\n\r\nIn letter combinations
    (how text always works anyway), I find the text above to be quite legible. What
    do you think?"

  body: "In small doses -- display purposes -- this could be quite fun. I am a sucker
    for black weights, and I find the E and G variants to be the most interesting.
    I'm always impressed by those who design typefaces with pixels.\r\n\r\nIn those
    two -- E & G -- I find the U and V, the c and e, the t, the u and v, the x and
    z -- to be the weakest or rather in need of a little more work for differentiation.
    What about a setting?"

  body: very cool. I'd hafta agree that D-G are the most interesting... and a setting
    of some text would be helpful to evaluate this more closely.

  body: "wow. i've been in the think tank for the last week or so, and i come back
    to some cool new features here!\r\n\r\nthank you all for your feedback here. i
    agree that this font has its problems. sometimes i have a lot of fun though, with
    problematic designs. i don't know what that says about my design sensibilities,
    but i think it helps me grow over the long-term.\r\n\r\ncan anyone clarify for
    me what is meant by setting? type setting a few sentences perhaps? or actually
    seeing it function as a titling font over some paragraph text?"
