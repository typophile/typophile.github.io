    there does seem to be a trend of petrochemical companies employing hypocritical
    branding to obscure the true nature of their business. BP switched to a green

    an image right now, but it had a kind of bomber jacket feel. Didn't take though.

    favorite movie tech logo is one used for the 70mm film projection format. Again,
    I don't know who designed it. The first time I noticed the design was on ads for
    \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" back in the early 1980s."

    and Terry Biddle offered the excellent BP logo redesign. Here's a couple images
    of that logo made REALLY BIG on the side of a fuel storage tank in Cushing, Oklahoma:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BPtank2_4427.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BPtank1_3519.jpg]\r\n\r\nSamadam
    posted an example of the US Air Force's new logo. Although that example appeared
    to use something different from the Arial type we were mandated to use in putting
    together this sign:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AirForceAltusAFB_3898.jpg]\r\n\r\nIMHO,
    Arial never looked any better than in stainless steel chrome type like this. Normally
    I really hate Arial, but this isn't all that bad. Note, this photo was taken when
    the sign was finshed and loaded on the beat up trailer and headed to the job site.
    If I can get around to taking a picture of the finished sign in its installed
    state I'll do it and post it here."

    back in the 60s? I saw it as a teen and it was one of the first things that really
    stirred me to think about lettering and graphic design. Although some of the letter
    shapes are not as graceful as I might like, the back-and-forth from pos to neg
    is brilliant. (And I'd venture the designers of the \"usa\" logo shown earlier
    were inspired by this, is that fair to say?\")\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eaton_5140.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA
    couple of other points. The mention of Shell and Esso reminds me of a fantastic
    article in the New Yorker from perhaps 1972 about the creation of the EXXON brand
    and all the research done to make sure the name meant absolutly nothing (they
    didn't want it to mean \"Your mother eats army boots\" in Hungarian or something
    like that). Much discussion about the development of the logo, too, by was it
    Chermayeff and Geismar?\r\n\r\nIf there are still UPS trucks where you live that
    have the globe symbol on them (instead of just the shield) next time you see one,
    note the position of the equator relative to South America! I miss the  utter
    simplicity of the original paul Rand logo, but I suppose companies feel they must
    change (and then designers get work). Interestingly, the Eaton logo is unchanged
    after more than 40 years . . . "

  body: "\r\nI have always liked this design, done by Norman Litman, for the Mead
    Paper Library of Ideas back in the 60s. The original is all on one long line but
    I chopped it up this way for easier posting. It's fun to see how really memorable
    and distinct in personality so many of these logos are, isn't it? And overall,
    a very expressive design by Litman. (There I go again, starting a sentence with
    a conjunction . . .) I shot this out of a book -- didn't want to hurt it in the
    scanner -- so there is some gutter artifact between the B and the LI. \r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I took this from a wonderful book that I'm sure many of you know, but those who
    don't should really try to find it (out of print for many years). Ray daBoll's
    <em>Recollections of the Lyceum and Chatauqua Circuits</em> (Freeport, Maine,
    Bond Wheelwright, 1969). The <strong>entire</strong> book is handlettered in his
    beautiful and unique italic hand. The front section is his wife's memoir of her
    times traveling as a singer and actress all over the American heartland, and the
    back is Ray's look at letter forms, handwriting, graphic design, and so forth.
    A most inspiring book from a warm, caring, not-at-all-corporate artist.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CorpPubExhibit_sm_4157.gif]"

  body: Ahhh. That brings back fine memories . . . In the late 60s/early 70s I attended
    a small "great books" college (Shimer) lost out in the cornfields of northwestern
    Illinois. Leinenkugel was the local marque, brewed just to the north of us across
    the state line, and we all drank it in loyal preference to the mass-manufactured
    offerings from Miller, Schlitz, Pabst, etc. Haven't tasted one since 1972, though.
