  sans serif typeface that has a subtle asian feel, particularly and indian look.\r\nI'm
  not looking for a pastiche on indian scripts such as this:\r\nhttp://www.monogrammedheirlooms.com/images/Monograms/Alphabets/IndianFont.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
  after something more along the lines of this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/imperial-dtc/\r\n\r\nA
  face that doesn't shout indian but can invoke a slight eastern feel.\r\n\r\nAny
  other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks."

    Maybe not quite what you're looking for, but if you can tell us what aspect of
    Indian culture you're trying to reference, perhaps we can make some useful suggestions.
