  body: Ted,  <BR> <BR>Not sure about where you or your customers are asking about.
    But in NYC there is a series of classes organized by the Type Directors Club,
    called the Masters Classes. Every 4th Thurs of the month, $25 for TDC members,
    $40 for non members. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.tdc.org/events/tdcmasterclass.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.tdc.org/events/tdcmasterclass.html</a> <BR> <BR>Currently
    they are taught by Ilene Strivzer of The Type Studio. <BR> <BR>I have not taken
    the classes myself, as I understand they are more focused on the use of type than
    on the design of type. I am  a user of FontLab, teaching myself with the manual,
    and I also would be interested in a class that focused a bit on the philosophy
    of type design but more on the practical aspects of using yours and others software.
    <BR> <BR>Perhaps I could urge you to contact the TDC or other like organizations
    to perhaps sponsor classes or workshops, dealing with FL.

    and FontLab do you long for. The TDC is looking to expand the offerings of the
    Master Class and any serious suggestions could be presented to the board. <BR>

  body: Ted, are you looking for typography classes or type design classes, i.e. classes
    in using type or making type? Your reference to ATypI workshops suggests the latter,
    but &#39;typography&#39; usually refers to design with type rather than of type.

  body: James, <BR> <BR>Thats really exciting. Forgive me if TDC already serves this
    in some capacity. to be honest I have been a rather negligent TDC member for the
    last year or so. I was kicking myself for having missed your Opentype lecture.
    <BR> <BR>I would find great value in a small group/class that focused on the design
    of type, particulary the technical side, although having a group to critique a
    work in progress is always helpful as well. I actually had tried this a couple
    of times with a small group of fellow designers, but I think it would benefit
    from having a structure. <BR> <BR>Having developed a number of font families now,
    while I&#39;ve simultaneously been  figuring out Fontographer and now FontLab,
    I&#39;m looking for help before I continue to set my uninformed or bad work habits
    in stone.

  body: 'Christian/James <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in for a series on type design using Font
    Lab. Topics that would be of interest to me would include: <BR>1. Drawing in Fontlab
    for Illustrator Junkies <BR>2. Encoding/Unicode explained <BR>3. Using mulitple
    master in FontLab <BR>4. Tips &amp; tricks for spacing/kerning a font &#40;general/class-based&#41;
    <BR>5. Creating opentype features <BR>6. The font header &#40;what do all these
    dialogue boxes mean!!!  <BR>How do they effect the way the font functions?? on
    macs, pcs?&#41; <BR>7. Exporting tips/tricks <BR>8. Hinting done right <BR> <BR>What
    would be really cool is a several month series where the group starts in the design
    process, then moves into the technical side addressing the issues above. <BR>
    <BR>Probably ambitious maybe, but I don&#39;t know of a class in New York that
    addresses the technical side of things. Most are learn to draw and alphabet, not
    turn your alphabet into a font. Thanks for starting the dialogue. <BR> <BR>R'

  body: Wow, <BR> <BR>do you still want to do MultipleMasters???? I gave that up in
    1996 after having done a 1-Axis and a 2-Axis using the then avant-garde FOG 3.5.
    Whilst MM ist a great idea, it is also a particular pain in the a&#42;&#42;&#42;
    to do. Trust me, I&#39;ve been there. And once you&#39;ve done the fonts, what
    apps actually still utilise MM. Adobe has dropped support for MM fonts some while
    ago. In fact a similar result can be achieved by extrapolating technology, as
    was used in Skia in the good old QuickDraw GX days. Easier too. <BR> <BR>Bruno

  body: I would hope that the references to Multiple Masters is more in line with
    using them as a development tool rather than a final product. They are still very
    useful in the former, not so in the latter.

  body: I on the other hand don&#39;t know my ascot from my elbow when it comes to
    MM. But my intention was for developmental purposes as I tried to decipher from
    the FL user manual, for creating families of weights, condensed and extended versions.

    third party software maker and market sales of the fonts themselves was virtually
    non-existant. Adobe actually was working on releases for the GX format but they
    were never released. Guess I find the example/argument a bit odd when comparing
    it to MM and its demise &#40;after a near decade run, whether or not it received
    the support that was hoped for&#41;. I still use MM. And from what I understand
    it is supported by the latest Mac OS system version. Extrapolation technology
    would be great, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where is it? <BR> <BR>'
