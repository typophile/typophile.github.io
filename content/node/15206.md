  doing an insertion followed by a contextual one-to-one substitution, but the insertion
  didn't work. In fact I couldn't figure out how to make Insertion work at all.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nI
  want to split up some Indic compound vowel signs (which have unicode codepoints)
  into the base parts so that I can insert other glyphs (vattus) in between.\r\n\r\n-
