  body: "Hi Typester,\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say this is a custom job, and definitely not
    my favourite one.\r\nThe closest font I can think of (with such a \u2018G\u2019
    and the middle vertex of the M above the baseline) is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/martin_gothic_bold_ot_std_urw/?sample_text=1000%20MIGLIA\">Martin
    Gothic</a>.\r\nF"
