  find on,  the ends of the curves of lowercase f,j,r, and the bottom stem of a y,
  in a font like Times, more pronounced in Bodoni?\r\n\r\nAre they a typically European
  / British feature?\r\nand while I'm here, what would people consider to be very
  \"British\" typographic features? that's a bit open I know but I'm open to any suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
  very much\r\n\r\n\r\nOrla"

    to push the edit buttom.\r\nSome more classic typeface genres that may feel typically
    British: Caslon, Baskerville, Clarendon. Then, those are around for such a long
    time that they can have a lot of other connotations, too."

  body: "Ball Terminals, thank you that's marvelous. Hehe! Yes I started in the Gill
    Sans area -  problem is I need something a with a little more flourish for a \"stylish\"
    headline. Difficult to not stray into Continental and/or Art-Nouveau territory,
    though.\r\n\r\nI've been playing with Nashville (TX-XLight)- , and \"Calamity
    Jane\" most recently so yes I am indeed going USA... Raphael was a close runner
    for a while too. could I trouble you for more decorative / headline British suggestions?\r\n\r\ncheers!"

    less Print-y - should have said this earlier! sorry\r\n\r\n\r\n"
