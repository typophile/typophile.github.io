body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI need to modify an existing font (OFL) to add a few characters
  (\xE7 and \xC7), to use it in french. \r\nI opened the .ttf font file in Fontlab
  Studio 5, duplicated the c with copy/paste, and added the tail.\r\n\r\nThe generated
  file is 36ko while the original is 17ko.\r\n\r\nWhat did I do wrong ?"

  body: "I just did something similar, just opening a font in Fontlab and then generating
    it again, resulting in a size increase from 70kb to 116kb. I then compared the
    two, using MS Font Validator, and found that some tables were added and some were
    deleted. Specifically:\r\nAdded:  LTSH, VDMX, hdmx\r\nDeleted: FFTM, GPOS\r\nIn
    addition, the contents of some tables were changed.\r\nSo, no, you did nothing
    wrong.\r\n- Herb"

    web-compatible formats. For example, search for 'make web fonts'.

  body: "It's all guess work given what you've provided for info.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps
    you've left the check box for \"autohint unhinted glyphs\" in the generate ttf
    section. Hinting could certainly add even more than that to the total size. "

    worth the effort in my opinion."
