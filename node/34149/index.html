Twice! Once by Image Club, and then by Solotype. Just the fact that
there are in fact two of them already is encouraging (I mean legally)
and I know that even H&amp;FJ have used names that were already out
there, but I&rsquo;m wondering: what are the probable legal ramifications?
Practically speaking, is it only Berthold that one must avoid tangling
with like the plague?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to bundle another question in here: What are your thoughts
concerning serif/sans font systems where each has a different name?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Like every lawsuit, that would be up to a judge (and jury?) to decide. But they could try, and if they try, it might cost you. The trademark holder probably won&rsquo;t care about your font, just that you are generating income with their property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s no good. So I assume people like Solotype and H&amp;FJ

</blockquote>
<p>How do you know that? I don&rsquo;t know that. The best thing to do is ask. If you want to register a trademark, you should have a lawyer do research for you to see if the name is in fact trademark-able.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the previous one does not have a trademark, isn’t
there something equivalent to “previous art” in copyright

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know. If no one has a trademark on the name, you can apply for one. If the others don&rsquo;t want you to have it, it is up to them to file an objection with the authorities during a certain application period.</p>
<p>In terms of copyright and design patents, those are not names, and are not things that fall under trademarks, which is waht I thought you were asking about. Protection for design copyrights and or patents differs depending on where you are. If I were you, I would ask the other other designers, rather than ask for legal advice. Solotype and H&amp;FJ are just a phone call away, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>When do trademarks expire?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Never? ;-)
Copyright is good for life of the author (or company), plus 70 years. At least in the US, I believe. Whether TMs another matter are?</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>If I do trademark it, what can I do about the pre-existing one?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>See what I wrote above. Your trademark application can be contested for a certain period of time.</p>

<p>The name you have in mind would have to be pretty damned spectacular. It&rsquo;s often easier to simply come up with a new name. Hey, how about a typophile <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Name That Font<!-- raw HTML omitted --> contest? Winner gets a license?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know a few of these, not a lawyer, yada yada, but I&rsquo;ve been researching this a long time&hellip;</p>
<p>First, DA has the most correct answer.</p>
<p>Trademarks don&rsquo;t expire. But they only last as long as someone is using them, and trying to protect them. They may become genericized, and then anyone can use them, like &ldquo;aspirin&rdquo; in the U.S.</p>
<p>The basic concept of a trademark isn&rsquo;t at all like a copyright. A copy write says you made (or acquired) something creative and have the final say on reproduction. A trademark claims only that you have a product with a label and it is so intrinsically entwined with the product&rsquo;s value that others using that name might benefit from your reputation, via that label.</p>
<p>Keep in mind neither you, Solo or Image have to have registered the Trademark to get benefits from it, that just makes things easier in litigation.</p>
<p>If two parties are using a name to sell two different (unrelated) fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at the same time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, either one would have a poor claim that the name is linked in the markets mind to only their face. Especially if neither is stopping the other. (Unless they are pursuing different markets.) However, the same applies to you, as well, if there are already others using that name, unregistered, good luck getting a judge to give you real trademark power, even if the local PTO had taken your money and given you a certificate. Keep in mind, to maintain that Trademark, you will have to be  a hawk on the butt of anyone using it, as well.</p>
<h2 id="others-feel-free-to-correct-this">Others, feel free to correct this.</h2>
<p>On the other half of the question, If you want a sans and serif with different names are they at least phonetically or thematically related? I have two projects in the cooker using that idea, a sans/serif pair and a text/display pair.</p>
<p>I also feel that if they are a &ldquo;close pairing&rdquo; they should have more similar names. If they share little more than metrics, then a weak link seems right.</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t Myriad/Minion were designed to compliment each other? Similar but subtle.</p>

<p>Not really. Myriad came later and was co-designed. I don&rsquo;t think they are that closely related; I would rather use, um, something else with Minion rather than Myriad. Myriad was originally a showpiece for Multiple Master technology, and was highly engineered to give smooth results across a wide range of width and weight. We just don&rsquo;t see many width variations of it any more.</p>

<p>Can a label start out like that? The name in question happens to be the name

<p>I think that&rsquo;s accidental; they were designed to be very general and neutral but were not otherwise coordinated or matched together.</p>
<p>Not sure why a particular name is so attractive; do you think it will make a big difference in the sales or perception of the type? The sad fact is that since the digital boom, it&rsquo;s much much harder to get the name you want because so many are taken. You could re-spell the town name or make up a word that includes part of it (rhymes). It&rsquo;s not Paducah is it?</p>

<p>Nope. In principle, it would have to be a word that is generic to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->consumers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the product it labels to never ever be trademarkable. Probably words like Typeface, Font, Alphabet and Letters. However, the way legal systems' gears mesh, the right IP lawyer could probably change even that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems that a font name if registered can be a trade mark or a service mark. The U.S. Congress considers the alphabet is in the same category as the wheel. The practice of assigning diffetent names to the same font was thoroughly explained by Hermann Zapf when he said that he was giving up after what happened to Palatino and its more than 23 names.
European laws are much better for the type designer and American font lawsuits are few and far between except Monotype vs. Linotype for Times Roman; ATF versus Lanston Monotype ended up with small royalties assessed.  Software is protected under U.S. law.</div>
