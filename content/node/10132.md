  font smaller than 12 pt.&#34; Since we have a lot to say, I&#39;ve been forced to
  choose typefaces on the basis of character size. <BR> <BR>&#40;I hear your sighs
  ... but it&#39;s a paying gig, and those are kinda hard to find in this place and
  time.&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, Perpetua is my current favorite for serif font; it&#39;s
  so tiny that we have to ad &#34;This proposal formatted in 12 pt Perpetua&#34; on
  the cover letter. The problem is that any sans I use looks huge next to it.  <BR>
  <BR>I have a vague memory of tables that listed &#34;characters per pica&#34; for
  different typefaces at different sizes; are those still around, or did they die
  w/ the advent of WYSIWYG? <BR> <BR>Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions -- both
  in serif and sans -- I&#39;d be grateful. Thx!'

  body: Well, I&#39;ve been using some condensed, but they look huge &#40;height-wise&#41;
    next to perpetua. But it&#39;s not x-height; it&#39;s just that perpetua is small
    ... or at least this incarnation &#40;Monotype?&#41; is. <BR> <BR>These are rather
    long and boring texts, written by engineers for engineers. I&#39;d like to make
    them as readable as possible, while breaking out of the mold. A lot of the competition
    use arial narrow as a text font -- sometimes further condensed&#40;Eeeew!&#41;
    in order to fit into the page limits. I want to come up w/ something that is more
    readable, doesn&#39;t use any more space, and is much more stylin&#39;. <BR> <BR>Thx!

  body: I am not sure what you are after, but Futura has  smaller x-height than most
    sans-serifs. Also the original &#40;not ITC&#41; Kabel. <BR> <BR>Vesta at GerardUnger.com
    is impressively readable for a sans. Myriad condensed is nice, as is Meta. Benton
    Sans from Fontbureau &#40;related to Trade Gothic, Franklin, etc&#41; has a number
    of condensed versions. No sans is as readable for text as any good text serif,
    in my opinion.

  body: 'You&#39;re trying to strike a balance between apparent size, economy and
    style. What you should note is: <BR>1&#41; A font with a smaller x-height does
    take up less room at a given point size, but at the expense of apparent size.
    <BR>2&#41; The requirement for 12 point &#40;probably&#41; comes from a desire
    for a minimum apparent size; if you &#34;cheat&#34; by using a font with a small
    x-height, it&#39;s going to come down to them saying &#34;but it&#39;s too small&#34;
    and you saying &#34;but it&#39;s 12 point!&#34; You need to try to predict which
    way that argument would end up going. <BR>2&#41; The larger the x-height, the
    more economical the face, and the more legible, but also the less readable. &#40;Although
    there&#39;s certainly a lower limit to the x-height ito readability&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>It seems that one thing you can do is choose a sans with a small x-height
    &#40;like Seria&#41;, but that&#39;s assuming they won&#39;t balk at the apparent
    size &#40;even though it&#39;s 12 point&#41;. Another possibility is to use a
    sans with a &#34;normal&#34; x-height but set the Perpetua larger &#40;but then
    things might not fit&#41;. <BR> <BR>If neither of those work, you could always
    just say less. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    <BR>RE: &#34;But it&#39;s too small!&#34; It might not be following the intent

    funny: I don&#39;t know why, but I have an unusually difficult time expressing
    myself in this forum. I&#39;m going to re-try on the description of my situation.&#41;</i>
    <BR> <BR>I work at an engineering firm, and I&#39;m trying to create a corp. identity,
    which includes proposals. Some of the &#34;Requests for Proposals&#34; include
    a type-size requirement, as in &#34;type shall be 12 points or larger.&#34; They
    also include page limits. <BR> <BR>In order to fit the verbage into the pages,
    I&#39;ve been using Perpetua, which is a very small typeface. Not small in x-height,
    but just small for its size. &#40;In order to make Gill Sans visually the same
    size as 12 pt Perpetua, you have to reduce Gill to 10 pt.&#41; <BR> <BR>The problem
    with Perpetua is that it&#39;s a bit spindly for this application. &#40;I create
    these proposals on a 4-color Xerox.&#41; Another problem is that if I use a contrasting
    san serif for headlines, it looks huge next to the perpetua, even at 12 pt. <BR>
    <BR>But now that I&#39;ve used it once, the engineers won&#39;t let me use a &#34;larger&#34;
    face. So I&#39;m looking for a similarly &#34;small&#34; face that is more robust
    &#40;thicker hairlines&#41;, plus a companion san serif, to be used in the proposals
    and other printed material. <BR> <BR>&#40;I hope that made more sense...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll check out the suggestions already mentioned. Thanks!'
