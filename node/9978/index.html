		<div class="commentbody">I'm surprised that sIFR hasn't made a bigger splash, actually. It's a little hinky here and there, but it basically works. Its biggest drawback is that it can't reliably draw with a transparent background. Also, at least with Safari, sIFR'd text, though it can be selected, can't be copied to the clipboard, which breaks one of its benefits. I'm cool with existing screen fonts for text. It's not great, but I can live with it for the moment. But I'm glad to have the option of any font I choose for headings without resorting to images.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The real issue is that it's not safe to assume that everyone browsing your site has any given fonts at all installed. While Microsoft was distributing their core fonts for the web, it was safe-ish, and we can assume that most clued-up web users will have the usual suspects (Verdana, Georgia, Courier, etc.) installed, there's no real way to present a consistent typographical feel to everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sIFR is an elegant hack for dealing with display type (and I appreciate the lengths its creators pursued to avoid interfering with assistive technologies), but it sucks for body type.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, the problem goes the exact other direction: Debian is the most exactingly anal free software distribution on the planet. They had a three-month flamewar recently on whether it was permissible to distribute software what would load binary-only firmware blobs into peripheral devices, if the license for the firmware was insufficiently free. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, this is all sort of off the point, because most users of desktop Linux are incapable of installing that package anyway (Debian's installer for it, which does some mildly bizarre things to avoid violating the MS EULA, is more straightforward than most). Surfing the web on Linux has been a pretty lame experience until pretty recently, and even now, it's kind of a pain. Free X servers only started offering decent antialising in the last few years, and until two years ago it was really difficult to configure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My point, such as it was, is that it would be really nice to have a method for ensuring consistent type display on the web that was independent of the underlying operating system. For the reasons we've been discussing, CSS isn't up to the job (even leaving aside browser implementation issues). I understand the technological, political, and social reasons why we don't</div>

The best example is the Apple website where the head menu could easily be done with text instead of images and the infamous Amazon.com Jeff Bezos greeting image, where an image is used to display a long piece of text, usually multiple paragraphs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All because of the 'no control about fonts' issues. I strongly believe we can make the web a nicer place if we just give the designers what they need to create a great user experience without cheating.

For some&hellip;typically long-time print designers, this is seen as a horrific loss of control. For others, it's seen a big benefit for a variety of reasons.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I overstated my case, maybe. I'm all for accessible sites, assistive technologies, and my elderly relations being able to decipher my rambling screeds about Satanic heavy metal by using their own fonts and colors. Also, every time I have to wade through some schlocky overdone Flash site to get at someone's photography, type, or writing, it makes me tetchy and unpleasant to be around. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the same time, &quot;separation of presentation and content&quot; is a canard that's been a canard since Marc Andreessen hacked the IMG tag into HTML, and it continues to be a canard even today in the days of XHTML 1.1 and CSS 3 (maybe, someday). Not only have the two always been hopelessly tangled on the real Web (not the theoretical, W3C Web), but I'm not sure that we, as typographers, would really want it to be otherwise. The only real justification we can provide for having hundreds of text faces and thousands of display faces is that typefaces become part of the texts they spell out. Even digital type rendered on lo-res screens has personality and character, and that character informs the text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's the reason I would like to see embedding. If I want absolute control over positioning and appearance, there's always PDF. What I actually want is a way to make my blog look nice for everyone by default. They can tweak it on their end all they want, but having no control at all</div>

Think about it from this POV: Either designers render their headlines and subtext into images (even CSS replacements like the Fahrner / Inman replacement, which is a lot of work if done manually) or they assign a font file to their headline ID or CLASS and all content is content. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This way you have the choice of 'breaking the intended design' and using your own font to display the document or doing nothing and use it as designed.
