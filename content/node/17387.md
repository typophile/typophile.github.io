body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Type Technologies]] : Intellifont</strong>\r\n\r\nIntellifont
  was a scalable font technology developed by [[Tom Hawkins]] at [[Compugraphic]]
  in Wilmington, Massachusetts USA during the late 1980s. Intellifont fonts were hinted
  on a Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) VAX mainframe computer. \r\n\r\nUsing DEC terminal
  computers, Design Engineers would enter command line instructions to launched programmes
  including the Intellifont hinting programme. This programme displayed [[Ikarus]]
  [[outlines]] on a Vector Automation screen. With a [[stylus]] pen the Design Engineer
  placed [[hint|hints]] via graphical links on the Ikarus outlines. These links are
  similar to the ones now seen in Microsoft's [[Visual TrueType]] and other hinting
  programmes. Intellifont production included a model based autohinter (1990) which
  allowed faster hinting by transferring hints from a library of previously hinted
  characters of common design styles. \r\n\r\nIntellifont technology was shipped with
  the Hewlett-Packard Laserjet III and IV and was one of the rasterizers in Agfa's
  UFST."
