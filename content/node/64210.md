  passion for different and interesting typography.\r\n\r\n\u2019Poppet\u2019 is a
  typeface that I created a couple of months ago. I wanted to transform each letter
  into \u2019characters\u2019.\r\n\r\nEach letter is doing an individual activity,
  that you would associate with children, i.e. hop-scotch, hula-hoop.\r\n\r\nThe letters,
  at the moment, are black, but I think that adding a bit of colour would bring each
  personality to life even more!\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!"

    \r\nAlso why do you want them to do things children would do?  Is it meant to
    appeal to kids? \r\n\r\nSome additional information about your thoughts behind
    this exercise would help. "

  body: "Looks pretty, but lacks originality. To be negative, it's just a decorated
    Myriad and nothing more. I think you should design it from scratch; you will learn
    many things and it can be much like what you wanted.\r\n\r\nI see few letters
    that are related to the activity. If you designed it to be educational, I think
    it's not working."

  body: "Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nIt is aimed at children, yes.  It's primarily a decorative
    typeface.  I've been creating name plaques, which is sort of like a personalised
    gift - suitable for a child's christening / birthday.  They've gone down quite
    well.  I've been trying to attach images of those, but it won't let me for some
    reason.\r\n\r\nIf I did want to make it purely educational, then yes, I would
    need to have the activity relate to the corresponding letter. i.e. A-apple, B-ball
    etc or along those lines."
