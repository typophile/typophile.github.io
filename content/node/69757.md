body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am designing a website for a polo club. As a source
  of inspirations I have the following picture of a magazine (1930), from the time
  this club was at its peak. Is there a close approximate to this font, which would
  fit nicely to the sport (fast, noble and demanding) and which would serve as a reminder
  to those times. I would use this font for headlines and maybe for the navigation.
  What body text would go nicely with it?\r\n\r\nAs I am yet new to web design and
  typography I would very much appreciate your help. I am a little stuck on this.
  I have already looked through type specimens but the sheer amount of fonts and the
  science to it is quite overwhelming. I hope I am not asking too much.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for you help and greetings from Austria\r\nFerdinand\r\n\r\nPS I have access to
  Typekit\r\n\r\n"
