  by posting in the wrong area.\r\n\r\ni am sure you chaps must have covered this
  before although a search beared no suitable results.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a font
  very close to the C4 family (channel 4), really desperate to find a close match.
  My client did not like my first choices of Din, Aniverse or Museo - at this rate
  i'll be whipping out Comic Sans and hanging my head in shame.\r\n\r\nthanks thomas"

    quite close, with a little tweaking I might be able to get some of the personality
    of the C4 font into that.\r\n"

    Soho Gothic comes fairly close with one of its OpenType stylistic alternate sets
