  through numerous problems with your help \r\nI have created my first typeface and
  generated an OTF\r\n\r\nHowever, the OTF file icon in windows is displaying \"\u2211\u221A\u2260\"
  like it does with corrupted fonts. I can't identify a problem and neither can FontLab
  studio.\r\n\r\nI have found a very weird thing though: in Illustrator's Glyph Pallette
  the glyps \"\xC0\" and \"\xC9\" show up as outlines, but when I write them they
  sow properly. What could this be?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance and sorry if this is
  a repeated topic, I really searched for an answer.\r\n\r\n-\xC1lvaro Franca"

    set\" tab. For some odd reason, FL occasionally\u2014and arbitrarily\u2014decides
    to assign \"Symbol\" to the Microsoft\xAE Character set, which could be what's
    causing the problem."

    outlines for those glyphs."

    it but it didn't change much..."
