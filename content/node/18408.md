    target=\"_blank\">House Chalet New York</a>.\r\n\r\nS = 1960 or 1980\r\nb = 1970\r\ne
    = 1960 or 1980\r\nr = 't' from 1970 with top cut off\r\nt = 1970\r\n\r\n\"MOTION
    GRAPHIC DESIGN\" looks to be Chalet New York 1960 as well (the 'C'  in \"GRAPHIC\"
    looks too round to be Helvetica).\r\n\r\n - Lex"
