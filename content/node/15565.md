  \ Anyone know of who might be offering it.  It might be named something closer to
  Cirkulus.  If I get approved on the project I will be buying Soraya - Yahoo!  Not
  that its the crem of the faces I would wish for by any means, but its always great
  to acquire more faces.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help."

    the comps.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cirkulus/cirkulus/\">Circulus</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfprimegraphics/soraya/regular/\">Soraya</a>
    are both commercial faces. o, 4, and 7 seem to be the only differences, though,
    so I wonder if all is kosher."
