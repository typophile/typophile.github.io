  to this forum, so first of all I hope you&#39;re all doing very fine! I&#39;m looking
  for a good font bible/encyclopedia that I can refer for traditional font families,
  their origins, usages and, if it&#39;s not too much to ask, a good display of those
  typefaces. Does any of you have a suggestion or two? <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot! <BR>
  <BR>Rafael&#60;/font&#62;'
