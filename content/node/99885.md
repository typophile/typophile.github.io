  the covers of the Crystal Palace matchday magazine in 1955. Would anyone know what
  the typeface could potential be? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/palace-towers_6715.jpg]

  body: I have a feeling that was done by hand, look how the two A-s in PALACE and
    the two L-s differ from each other.

    body: 'Thanks for your quick reply. The ''R'' and ''Y'' are very distinctive characters
      . Like you mentioned it has been hand-drawn, but like most things the lettering
      must have been based on an existing typeface. ''Seconda'' seems to be the closest
      from your suggestions. '
