    Do you have a higher-quality scan?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "No.2 is a techno style that is similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/21-st/|21st]]
    from Identikal, and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/saturn/|Saturn]] from
    2Rebels. Saturn is more rounded, like Eurostile with the stem extensions removed.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-identikal/seize/|Seize]]
    from Identikal is also similar, but would need some stem amputation to get closer.\r\n\r\nWhen
    a techno style doesn't show up readily at MyFonts, I usually check the Techno>Sci-fi
    category at Dafont.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think the third one does look like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/times-new-roman/|Times
    New Roman]], but it seems like a slight addition was made to the stroke thickness
    -- it's bolder than the regular weight, but lighter and different from the Bold
    weight. This would be easy to do with InDesign or Illustrator.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "For No.1 I agree with Nick about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/skyline/|Corvinus]],
    by Imre Reiner, but the Font Bureau version called Skyline seems to bracket this
    sample. The R in Skyline Black is wrong, and the font is too short, but if you
    squoosh (flatten/widen) the Condensed version I think you would have it. Other
    foundry versions of Corvinus Skyline might also work, but would also need to be
    flattened/widened.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
