body: "Does anyone know the story of \"the Font Company\" that used to sell a ton
  of fonts from Phoenix. I did an initial search on the web and didn't find anything
  definitive. We are still limping along with some old versions of fonts we purchased
  from them. They seem to break down over time and stop working. I've purchased replacements
  from URW, which had a partnership with the Font Company, I gather. I'm just curious
  about the history of this company. The Typowiki link takes me to the search engine
  rather than an entry.\r\n\r\nTypedia  crashes\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin"

  body: '@Kristin - We offer a small selection of Font Company fonts on our site:
    [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/foundry/font-company/|www.AscenderFonts.com]].
    As you noted, a much broader selection can also be found in the [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/foundry/urw/|URW
    font library]], because of their relationship. We don''t offer Type 1 versions,
    but do have OpenType and TrueType for most all of these.'

  body: "Thanks, Bill. I did know that and I've purchased fonts from Ascender in the
    past. Mostly, I was curious about company details: who worked there, how long
    was it opened, what was its contribution to the type world. My internet searches
    aren't coming up with anything interesting. Sigh.\r\n\r\nKristin"

  body: "Hi Kristin,\r\n\r\nDan Barthel was the owner of The Font Company out of Phoenix,
    AZ and now lives in Ft Myers, FL . . . I have his phone number if you wanted to
    REALLY get all the inside scoop . . .\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, he was among
    the first groups along with a handful of young employees he trained to scan and
    digitize fonts from filmstrips and did a number of conversions for Harry Brodjian
    of Alphatype faces in the late 1980s. Among those included were Parade and Contemporary
    Brush Bold which were eventually licensed by Robert Norton for Microsoft . . .
    I'm certain they used the Ikarus system to make their digitizations . . .\r\n\r\nThe
    Font Company eventually went on to digitize a good amount of faces and nearly
    all of them were distributed by the Precision Type Company until it closed its
    doors in the mid-2000s . . . Get your hands on one of those catalogs to see the
    entire library they released . . .\r\n\r\nAt some point in the 1990s Dan decided
    to close up shop and tossed all the assets digital or otherwise and start over
    in another business but walked away from the font business all together regardless
    . . .\r\n\r\nBecause of my research for the Filmotype story, tracing it through
    its timeline eventually lead me to The Font Company when Harry Brodjian took over
    the Filmotype name to release new desktop typesetters and re-release Filmotype
    and Alphatype fonts digitally . . . It's all documented in my Filmotype book you
    can get here: http://www.fontbros.com/merchandise.php\r\n\r\nFeel free to write
    offline if you want to contact Dan directly via phone at diner (at) fontdiner
    (dot) com . . .\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart"

  body: "Thanks, Stuart! That really is what I wanted to find out. I was a frequent
    customer of the Font Company for many years. I was also involved with digitizing
    fonts for Alphatype. Serendipity! I'll be contacting you about purchasing your
    book!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
