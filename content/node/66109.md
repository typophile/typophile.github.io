body: "As many of you have heard, Canadian typographer Jim Rimmer passed away in his
  home on Friday, January 8 after a courageous fight with cancer. Jim designed dozens
  of typefaces, most of which were issued digitally through P22, some released in
  metal through his Pie Tree Press & Typefoundry, and even a few faces were issued
  in both digital and metal formats. \r\n\r\nI was fortunate to have known Jim and
  to have learned from him how to print and how to cut my own type in metal, but most
  of all to have been friends with the man over the past 12 years. Undoubtedly there
  will be many tributes to Jim, one of which is the Facebook page Remembering Jim
  Rimmer, which you can see -- and contribute to -- here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Remembering-Jim-Rimmer/277069136998

  body: "My favourite memories of Jim involve visits to his workshop in New Westminster:
    one of those very humane workspaces that printers seem so good at creating for
    themselves. Of course, Jim was both a printer and a typefounder, and the two rooms
    expressed something of the natures of these two undertakings: the printing room
    expansive and light, filled with warm wood and carefully cleaned pressed; the
    foundry cramped and dark, filled with lead-spattering and jerry-rigged industrial
    machinery.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Brian Morgan and I went to document Jim cutting and
    casting a keepsake for that year's ATypI conference in Vancouver, and I'm pleased
    to see that the <a href=\"http://www.atypi.org/news_tool/news_html?newsid=127&from=\">photographs
    and account of that visit</a> are still on the ATypI website.\r\n"

  body: Mr Rimmer was my first type hero, as a young graphic designer in the late
    '80s. His Albertan was used extensively in Mediamatic Magazine back then, and
    I loved the way it looked, especially at display sizes. It took me several months,
    back in the pre-internet days, to identify it. I still have the original floppy
    from Giampa. Rest in peace, Mr Rimmer.

    witnessing Jim's prolific multiple-mastery in his studio, being exposed\r\nfirst-hand
    to the rarified crafts of pantograph usage and punchcutting:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/sets/72157622668087871/\r\n\r\nI
    haven't known anybody so generous with sharing such expertise.\r\nHe was the best
    possible influence on us. And that's gone now.\r\n\r\nPaul, I don't have a Facebook
    account.\r\nBut this has the best chance of changing that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I was saddened to hear this news. I had not known that Jim was ill. \r\n\r\nI
    was also fortunate to spend an afternoon visiting with Jim at his studio. This
    was the last day of ATypI in Vancouver back in 2003. Michelle Hill and I bailed
    on the afternoon sessions and drove over to Jim's. It was wonderfully inspiring
    and educational.\r\n\r\nI only wish that I'd been able to take him up on his standing
    invitation to come spend a week working with him, learning to cut matrices and
    cast type."
