  entire FF Nexus family) and a paper sample.\r\nAnd I'm getting to know the Nexus
  quite well in the process.\r\n\r\nBesides showing the characteristics of the Nexus,
  I'm planning\r\nto feature some comments by Martin Majoor himself. But I think \r\nit
  would be very interesting to feature some comments\r\nby other people (typophiles)
  as well.\r\n\r\nSo please, tell me about your experiences with Nexus.\r\nHow do
  you feel about the Nexus family and it's design? \r\nPraises, moans, anything goes!\r\n\r\nI
  look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
