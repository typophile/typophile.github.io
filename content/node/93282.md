body: "I have received a Word doc from a client with a word displayed in a phonetic
  alphabet font (see attached sample). I can't seem to find a font on my Mac OS 10.6.8
  running InDesign CS 5.5 that will match the characters. I would have thought the
  OT version of Minion Pro, for example, would work, but no joy.\r\n\r\nFWIW the font
  used in Word is listed as HiraMinPro-W3, which to me indicates it is at least sourced
  from Minion Pro. Maybe I'm just a gumby and can't activate the required set through
  the Open Type dialog in InDesign?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    you show is not Minion. Times New Roman, among other system fonts, does. My preference
    is Gentium, which you can download for free online.\r\n\r\nHere, for instance:\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=Gentium_download\r\n\r\n[Edit:]
    Actually, on second thought, Minion does have what you need for this one word,

  body: HiraMinPro W3 has nothing to do with "Minion Pro", it is the Japanese font
    Hiragino Mincho Pro W3, which is included with every Mac OS X, so you should certainly
    have it.

  body: When installing OS-X I believe the Japanese fonts are installed by default
    but you have the option to not install them, so if you can't find them you may
    need to go back to your installation disks.
