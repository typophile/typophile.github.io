  absolutely tore me apart, but still wanted me to work with them. Interesting people:)\r\n\r\nFirst
  and foremost they really didn't like that I had \"designed the portfolio\". They
  told me my work should be enough on it's own.\r\nOne of the designers had to fetch
  his glasses to read my captions.\r\nThey rolled their eyes over some of my work,
  and also told me the way I presented it was terrible. "

    sets an uncomfortable precedent for the future: they're right and you're wrong.
    They sound somewhat arrogant actually. No big news here. Most graphic designers
    -- and moreso with those in 'high' positions -- as well being conservative, insular
    and unimaginative, are drunk with self-importance.\r\n\r\ndid they say anything
    positive? how do you feel it went?\r\n\r\nhonestly, sometimes people say you havn't
    been creative enough with your folio presentation, and other times the contrary.
    it's a minefield. to quote larry david: you just can't leave your house.\r\n\r\nI
    think a few difficult folio showings is good for the soul in the end."

    i reviewed student portfolios every week (for three years) at mtv, i noticed strong
    trends in portfolio strength and weakness from certain schools. in the new york
    art school area, the portfolios from SVA were consistently better and cleaner
    and stronger than student presentations from any other area school. \r\n\r\nseveral
    of the SVA students mentioned that they were required to take courses in portfolio
    presentation. i wish more schools would emphasize this often overlooked and misunderstood
    skill.\r\n\r\nin the professional arena one must present and sell as much as one
    must design."

    not just limited to your interviews, they'll want you to hold your own during
    crits on your projects as well. If they want you to work for them, I'd say the
    good must've outweighed the bad, so don't be to hard on yourself.

    is there to be warped, neologised, parodied, poeticised, ignored and more. It's
    a toolbox, not a doctrine. We need convention to communicate, but there is a lot
    of room for manoeuvre. The crux lies in whether meaning is communicated and even
    then it's a minefield of variables.\r\n\r\nsorry to hear that asen. I've had several

    a burst balloon carrying a black folio case. Makes you stronger and gives you
