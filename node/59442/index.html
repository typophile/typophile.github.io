  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm currently working on a logo for my sister who's becoming a freelance accountant. I've tried to keep ther logo formal & geometric to suit the branch she's in, but I'm not really pleased with the results so far. I'm quite happy with logo a. (if I don't stare at it for too long), but it seems to be lacking something. I like the idea behind logo c. (wordmark 4.) as well, but not the execution. Same story with logo d.; the idea here was to have a baseline & an arrow by arranging her initials K & L to represent a logistic kind of icon. As for the wordmarks, number 3. is probably my favourite, but some other opinions would be nice to hear.
Any suggestions are welcome![img:sites/default/files/old-images/KL_6613.jpg]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think a/b is the most promising logo direction. Not sure about the weights of it in a, though - it has a little Arts-and-Crafts monogram or stained-glass quality to it that isn't quite right. And maybe try having the horizontal and vertical form a vertex just outside the diagonal line (see the join of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/roman/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D26%26dock%3D0%26size%3D61%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3Dk%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga|Frutiger's k]] for an example of what I mean) - that might convey precision well.

Logo c seems arbitary and calls to mind Fed Ex. Logo d says "hitting the glass ceiling" to me.

I agree that wordmark 3 is best of these. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Logotype 3 is the most promising, but the visual weights vary too much. The t and the j especially wonk against each other. (Is that a thing?) Aside from tweaking the line weights, I think it works great for a female accountant. 

Logo b is the most pleasing. I like the colors, but I'm not sure they're appropriate for an accountant. Perhaps deep blues mixed with soft, steely grays would offer a more sturdy yet feminine aesthetic? I'm seeing an oxidized silver pendant look -- something that has some actual weight to it. Evocative of a woman smack-dab between Lilith Crane and "I am woman, hear me roar" on the femininity continuum. (That conjured up Julia Sugarbaker in my head, actually!)

I often surf around on etsy when I need inspiration for women-owned businesses. [[http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5868807|This artist has a weighty yet feminine look.]] Just a thought.</div>

I've taken it under consideration & I like the idea of only using a wordmark. I'll have to explain it to my sister though 'cause to people who are not into graphic design, it might just seem lazy ;-)
I'm glad you all voted for 3., so I used that as a jumping off point. Since my sister's a person & not a company, I tried to give the wordmark a bit of a 'human touch'. I'm a big fan of swashes myself & I though this would be a good idea to give the wordmark a feminine feeling. Hopefully this won't take it too far away from accountancy although I don't really mind making it a little 'off-centered' if you know what I mean ('cause to be honest I don't recall ever seeing a goodlooking accountant logo). I kept it all very minimalistic to try not to disturb the equilibrium between accountancy & femininity & I like the outcome though I'm a bit scared it might look to florist-like to other people. So again, I'd like your advice on these versions. My personal favourites are 2. & 4..
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KL2_4868.jpg]
I've also made some alterations to the logo as suggested, but I think I'll stick to the wordmark only.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, this is a really nice solution.
What this swash approach seems to communicate, to my eyes, is: It's serious business (&lt; the squarish regularity of the type), and she fulfills that exactly and nicely; but, she also thinks out of the box, and adds her personal "note" to what she does (&lt; the unexpected but nicely working swashes) &ndash; an unexpected plus! It's serious with a feminine touch. Nice.

I'd just take care not to make it *too* exuberant/extravagant though &ndash; she doesn't make jewelry, in the end. To my eyes, #4 works best (and is the max in swashiness that I'd see in this, maybe tone it down a little?). Maybe #2, but I'm not sure about that "j" swash, it looks a bit tight and not very "flowing".

It doesn't communicate <em>what</em> she does, but that might be difficult with accountants anyway and if it's not an absolute requirement for her, so be it.</div>

The b/w logo feels "heavy", perhaps more fit for an edgy graphics designer. The color logo mark looks more like a non-profit / community logo of some kind, again nothing that would evoke associations with a freelance accountant (not sure what it is actually) at all.</div>

To me the J treatment is more subtle and sophisticated. The swash on the K's look thin and fragile, a bit too swashy - keep it closer to the either the Cap height or the base line not extended quite so far. Will you be adding her title as well?

I'm definitely through with the logo now & will stick to a simple wordmark. Counting the votes, it'll probably be 4., but I might suggest all of them to my sister. She gave me 'carte blanche' for this logo so I don't want to betray her trust by quickly settling for a definite solution.
I had already shown her the fonts I wanted to use for her identity (I'll be using Titillium (http://www.campivisivi.net/titillium/) -a recently found treasure- for accompanying texts). She liked both & agreed they would fit her line of business well. Hopefully she won't think the opposite of the swashes.
I've had quite a hard time trying to convey accountancy through a (decent) logo & to be honest I still don't know how to do it without using a icon for a calculator or abacus, but with all your help I just might have found the perfect solution! :-)</div>

agreed with the swashes. I think number 1 works particularly well - a little flourish, but not too much.

The 'T' shape bothers me ... but that's probably personal more than anything.

Nice one.

4. Shortened swashes (the second one looks too small to me now, but the first one might work well with the original second)
5. Thicker swashes (a real improvement IMO)

		<div class="commentbody">I think #5 looks great - you've thickened the swatches enough to make it look like a more natural extension of the typeface you chose. My only suggestion is the angle of the swash on the first K... it droops a bit compared to the actual leg of the K in the typeface. Might want to let it reach out a bit more. Overall, it's a very lovely wordmark for what your sister does. I hope she likes it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like #6. It's thicker (which is good, yes) and simpler. #5 is just a bit too swashy for me . . . doesn't seem to suit the application or the typeface.

I also like #7. Although it looks like there is too much space between the 't' and the 'j'. You may also want to thicken the swash on this one as well.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree &ndash; #6 rocks. 
I would try it with the "L" from #3, possibly. And maybe make the swashes a little bolder? As in #5? :-)
What I like about #6 is that it's less girly/weddingy, and more determined/fresh – while still feminine. But ultimately, *you* will have to know how "swashy" your sister is!

The swash in #7 looks a bit like a slip of the pen to me; a bit undecided. The ones in #6 are more deliberate, which seems good.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">#6 but only with the first K customized. The downward swoosh also defines a space underneath the wordmark to put some secondary text in (e.g. "freelance accountant").

Oh, and #7 too, but as penn pointed out, it needs some kerning work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok. The very first batch of logos seemed all better than this. I know they may look rigid to you, but remember that your sister is not in creative business. She's in accounting. No place for soft and undefined numbers. Your logos are very feminine but they don't relate to accounting at all.

If I had to choose from any of the last batch I'd go with #7, because I trust my accountant for its precise calculations and great tax suggestions. No space for variables here... I'd keep the minimum swash of the J just because she's a woman.

Ever thought of incorporating numbers between letters in very light contrast variation and also with more soft and rounded stroke? This way, you'd emphasize your sister's name make it strong and powerful but have those numbers reflect feminine feeling while still connecting with accounting precision ...

BTW: the 3+4 in the very first batch looked something I could relate with. Beside having a great logo as asterisk/miltiplication.

		<div class="commentbody">I disagree, obviously. From what my one accountant friend tells me, this can be a vocation where you don't only need to be very exact in sticking with the numbers, but you need to think, and find connections, and have strategies. It's hard business, yes, but it's not as completely bland and uncreative as many think, I've been made to believe. This friend has his *heart* in it and says it's really not as grey and monotonous as many people think. I have no reason not to believe him, but maybe it would be interesting to hear if Tom's sister herself thinks this is true.

Thinking out of the box, finding strategies, offering a little extra effort on top of very accurate and precise work (which, obviously, remains the core): If that makes sense in her field (and I have been assuming it does), then <em>that</em> is why I'd think the (subdued) swash makes sense in there. Not because women need swashes by default (please).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe the term 'feminine' was a little misplaced or just a wrong choice of words... The idea behind the swashes was mainly to take the edge of the first draft, making it a bit less bland, more friendly looking. Basically just adding a little personality. PennANDink made a good comment by stating that it's a logo for a person, not a business & I tried to convey some of my sister's personality in this logo rather than just sticking to a general idea about accountancy that most of us probably have (that it is indeed grey and monotonous). I think the aspect about accountancy that attracts my sister to it is basically the accuracy & details that are needed to do it right (almost in a motherly caring way). I think that's an aspect about our personalities that we share (which in our case is borderline neurotic ;-p) although it translates very different for both of us & only really reveals itself in everyday situations. Out of the 2 of us (or even 3 counting my other sister) Katja is probably the most 'centered' one, but that doesn't make her bland or boring by any means. Being convential doesn't make you narrow-minded by default at all; in a worst case scenario it just hides it better to the outside world. I guess what I'm trying to say with the swashes is that there is more than meets the eye.
Altaira's first interpretation after the introduction of the swashes was precisely what I was aiming for: precise but personal, professional but not robotic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm a traditionalist, so I'd go with #3 from the top of the page.  Wide spacing, bold and understated typography does it for me, personally. Always makes me think, "established" and "confident". But, you have to respect any attempt to take the edge off what's thought to be an ultra conservative profession. Everyone pictures accountants lined up in freshly pressed grey suits, calculators in hand. I'd hazard to guess the majority of their time is spent dealing with their clients, quelling fears of financial disaster. This would be the perfect time to distance one's self from the established stereotypes and bank excesses. </div>

Whilst I do like the others  (especially #6), like a few previous commenters, I agree they scream anything but accountancy

#7 strikes a nice balance however. It incorporates a bit of your sisters personality without being over the top</div>
