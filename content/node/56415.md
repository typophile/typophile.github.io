    be presented, but be consistent about it.

  body: "I've always loved kerning headlines, and used to do it with a scalpel back
    in the day.\r\nBut when making fonts I try and minimize the amount of kern pairs
    I include, and now put in less kerning than I used to when I started out."

    I asked him if he kerned his numbers, because I was really impressed with how
    they worked together, and he just replied, no, just hours spent spacing. '

  body: "How much one kerns varies a good deal by what kind of work one does and what
    fonts one does it with. I tend to stick with fonts by foundries that are known
    for getting the spacing right for the intended use to begin with and I don\u2019t
    believe that logos should be kerned/tracked in just for the hell of it, so I really
    only need to kern big headlines. I suspect that if I did book covers or advertising
    kerning would eat up much more time.\r\n\r\nIn the fonts I\u2019m developing I
    try to avoid too many kerning pairs. It would be nice if I could find a database
    of pairs and what language they appear in so that I can feel comfortable ignoring
    pairs that are really only needed for phonetic transliteration of Chinese and
    other things that nobody would do with my fonts."

    an exact science. But it is a lot like a muscle. Train yourself to see where the
    problems arise in your design and kerning becomes easy."

  body: Re reading this thread I see that the orthodox view has not been clearly stated
    even if it has been suggested.. That view is the vast vast majority of a design
    should work without kerning. Good spacing should come from good side bearings
    and from forms that fit well together. Of course you will need some kerning, but
    it will be only for exceptionally difficult combinations. Also Caps should be
    spaced to combine with lowercase, and Small caps with other small caps. Kerning
    should be done at the very end of the design process.

  body: Eben -- you're addressing kerning primarily from the standpoint of type design
    and font development. However, I believe the original poster was asking the question
    from the standpoint of a designer, regarding manual kerning of display type.

  body: Unfortunately the background of the original question seems to be technology
    and tools and how to cope with or avoid them, rather than design. A typeface needs
    as much kerning as it takes so it produces even [insert any other adjective] text.
    Whether one loves or hates to produce possibly required kerning is not relevant.

    makes kerning on the part of the designer a function of aesthetics.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "When I did page layout and magazine work, I made Illustrator files saves
    as outlines of mastheads/banners etc. I tweaked them to fit eachother by kerning
    and outline adjustment. For typical text that does not repeat, I rarely kerned
    anything at text sizes but almost always kerned larger headlines. If I was lucky
    enough to be using a well fitted font, this was easy. Some clients had to use
    some fonts that were not well crafted and they took more work. The truth is, the
    deadline wasthe master, if I didn't have time, I overlookd the less objectionable
    stuff. Granted, this was a few years back when the only thing available were type
    1 fonts. Type quality is better now, at least by all the good designers.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
