<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey all, the search isn't working, so don't know if this has been addressed before or not.
Anyway, I have this client I do some work for who likes to put either a (R) or a ^TM after EVERY company name or product. As you can imagine, this results in quite a few of these things. (It's not just his company, it's EVERY company he mentions or does business with.)
My question is what effect, if any, this has on readability and comprehension. I mean, it seems like "Microsoft Windows" is going to be easier to grasp than "Microsoft® Windows™"
Any thoughts? Any studies or actual facts on this matter?
Thanks.

<div class=commentbody>Well, something that would take a mark like that isn't generally read immersively - which means maybe it's not so bad. A valid readability concern though is the "textural distraction" that such marks have <strong>before</strong> the reader gets to that point of the text (sometimes from many lines before).
Also, a big issue in something like this is Familiarity, specifically here how quickly it's gained with something jarring like this; maybe with a proper name the reader has to learn the bouma <strong>anyway</strong> so again it's not so bad. Nobody really knows though... So I might work the aesthetics angle (as in, it's ugly); and/or look for a font with discrete marks, to reduce the textural distraction.

<div class=commentbody>let me give you a ferinstance...
"Microsoft® Windows™ consistently outperforms Linux™ based sytems on Dell® Opteron™ boxes using FakeSofts® Checker™ software. In fact Microsoft® Windows™ outperforms MacOS™, OSX®, and other Unixes™ even when FakeSofts® Checker™ software isn't used in accordance with IEEE™ standards. "
That's obviously not a real sentence, but it demonstrates the kind of density of bugs I'm talking about. If I superscripted them, well, then there is just a dot after every other word. Hrant got the idea - it's not "what can I do about it" or "do I have to do it" it's "How can I convince my client not to do this without saying 'Because it's flipping hideous!'?"
Re: Reading this immersively - what exactly qualfies as immersive reading? We're talking 250-1000 words of product descriptions. I don't really have a problem using these things in display text or headlines, but in the body it really seems to break up the flow.
Tell me more about this "textural distraction" thing, that sounds like a promising avenue.

(the other thing that gets me is he likes to put them where they totally not required, like after IEEE or UNIX. The argument for that is "better safe than sorry!" which is difficult to respond to without lapel-shaking)

<div class=commentbody>If the trademarks are owned by the client then its understandable that they would like to protect them by 'bugging' the marks. My company's policy is to bug only the first use of a mark on any given document.
As for marks not owned by the client, unless there's some legal requirement between the owner of the marks and the client, they may be able to avoid bugging and just put a standard TM disclaimer on the doc "all TM's not marked remain blah blah blah". Obviously they should talk to their lawyer before doing this.

<div class=commentbody>> what exactly qualfies as immersive reading?
Good question. There isn't necessarily a clear threshold. In fact in this case if somebody has decided to read the thing, he'll get through it before getting a headache. The question though becomes: do you want to make reading this thing so unpleasant than the reader just gives up?
> Tell me more about this “textural distraction” thing
Basically, when there's enough of a "spike" in the texture or color of text, the eye wants to jump directly to it to quickly figure out what this "special" thing is. When this happens, the eye then has to go back to where it was; this is wasteful and tiring. When a paragraph is littered with such spikes, it become quite unpleasant to read.

But here's a possibly stronger argument:
Somebody reading such text might think it's a parody.

<div class=commentbody>Are you concerned solely with readability?
There is a slightly more subtle problem -- using TM and other devices makes the publisher or writer look like a shill for the companies whose products are mentioned.
If that is what you want, then use them by all means, but make them small and unobtrusive. But if not, no need. (Check with your lawyer, of course.)
The <em>New York Times</em> doesn’t even use intercaps in company names, btw (let alone TM symbols).
