    is kinda slow compared to the high standards we uphold on this trusty board. I&#39;ve
    seen Stephen fire away like madman on numerous occasions, and we do have ID&#39;s
    within a couple of minutes. Check some other threads, you&#39;ll see.

    I think you should consider using a jpg for your pix instead of a gif... you look
    kinda &#34;pimply&#34; or more to be accurate, &#34;pixley&#34;. <BR> <BR>You
    know what, Scoles, I think we should move all the unidentified fonts to a separate
    thread like so that it stays up there and more people can have a crack at it.

  body: Hey, that&#39;s a great idea. <BR>There would have to be some kind of flag
    that the orignal requester would have to set indicating &#34;Font Identified&#34;,
    and any threads that still have the flag unset after let&#39;s say one week would
    go into a special section.  <BR>But then the moderator would need to occasionally
    set the flag himself, if the originator flakes. So maybe instead the originator
    should have to actively set a flag &#40;but not sooner than a week&#41; saying
    &#34;Not Yet Identified&#34;, and then it would move to the special section. Yeah,
    that&#39;s better. Although the moderator will still have to unset the flag himself
    once in a while. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I haven&#39;t thought about how it could be done technically. I just thought
    that maybe Scoles could check through the posts and move the ones that are still
    unidentified to a new thread. It could just be left in the same thread even when
    it&#39;s identified. Then we know which were the hard ones. <BR> <BR>That&#39;ll
    keep him busy for a while and the rest of you hopefully will get to score more
    IDs. <BR> <BR>Also, pixelman, it&#39;s not that hard to figure out the ones that
    are unidentified. They usually have a very small number of posts. Like 2 or 3.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant&#39;s idea is much more sophisticated. But I suspect it&#39;ll
    take a while to implement. And I don&#39;t want to wait that long for my posts
    to get a second chance at being identified.  <BR> <BR>Fyi, they are <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/3013.html?1038971738">here</a>

    I think it  <BR>might work. I&#39;ll keep an eye on useless subject names too.  <BR>  <BR>And
    yeah, someday I&#39;ll pull out all the oldies that are still  <BR>unidentified

  body: Yipee! Thanks thanks thanks! <BR> <BR>But I think the unidentified fonts should
    have their very own folder, just like the archived items. Otherwise they may push

    I can&#39;t resist asking, do you have any ideas on the two fonts that I posted?
    Does anyone?

    connectors and the line quality, but that&#39;s still quite far off. I can assure
    you, it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t care, we just can&#39;t find them. <BR> <BR>Damn

    There&#39;s a chance the bond font could be in indiefonts. Fingers crossed. <BR>
    <BR>I might also email the corp comm department of the tourism board and the bond

    have to agree it looks sooo much like Mistral, but for the Cap S or the g.

    someone&#39;s just BSing, rate 1 star. <i>Usually</i> people like Hrant, Stephen
    and some others get lotsa stars, because they can be informative and funny at
    the same time, while anonimous posters in heated discussions are more likely to
    collect 1 star when they&#39;re just kicking around and adding nothing to the
    discussion. <BR> <BR>Personally I think it&#39;s a pretty silly idea to go rating
    posts on a message board, but then again I&#39;m kinda partial to silly ideas.
