body: "What do you think about it?\r\n\r\nThere's something about it that I think
  could really work, namely, immediate, hassle-download-free installation for even
  the less knowledgeable layman, direct to user updates with minor effort (re-installing
  a font in font book for example presents more steps than anyone other than a designer/font
  enthusiast would want to bother go through), revisions and multi device licensing
  (as in installing in every device I'm logged in).\r\n\r\nThere are platform, store
  issues etc. but somehow it seems like a very simple, elegant way of making them
  available to the public.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be really cool to have something like
  that made and work platform independently that would somehow \"talk\" to your os
  and do all the dirty work simply and elegantly.\r\n\r\nAnyone with me on this?\r\nCheers\r\nRodrigo"

    fonts as system wide resources (something traditional OS's have allowed since
    the 80's) but the first to do so should be able to instantly add 200,000+ new
    \"Apps\" to it's app store. :-)\r\n\r\nPS. RB's 99 cent concept was presented
    at TypeCon LA and was related to web fonts."

  body: "Hrant, I must agree, and I think .99 could actually make more people buy
    fonts \"on impulse\", expand the market and certainly reduce piracy. Of course
    there's an issue where a crappy product would be leveled with an amazing product,
    but maybe the sheer ammount of purchases would of course also reflect that gap.\r\n\r\nSil,
    maybe it should be like iBooks or newsstand, a separate entity or something. And
    maybe if they do it the \"apple way\" instead of having to rely on outside, uncurated/unchecked
    .otf files this lock down on font installing wouldn't happen.\r\n\r\nRiccard0
    - thanks for the links!\r\n\r\n"
