    in L&#39;Isla, a shopping center on Barcelona&#39;s Diagonal boulevard. Before
    that I used a plastic Pentel mechanical pencil, which was really almost as good
    &#40;just not as sex-saayyyyy&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Gotcha. Thanks! By the way, Fredrik, my hat&#39;s off to you. When I&#39;m
    not looking for high tech, I use a General&#39;s Sketching Pencil for rough sketching
    -- the one with the super wide lead, like a carpenter&#39;s marking pencil. Sharpen
    it with my ol&#39; Marine Corps K-BAR knife.

    <BR> <BR>Note that the various rules are just here for baseline and such side

    his typeforms. Very.
