    is asking. For my part, I\u2019d appreciate it when we could do without the same
    old \u2018Please help! Need to identify this font.\u2019"

  body: "Hi Florian,\r\n\r\nMy apologies, I was being a bit sarcastic. \r\n\r\nAnd
    although I agree with your argument of skipping the \"Please help! Need to identify
    this font.\", I always liked the extra bit of info you mostly get when a type-Id
    request was made. And I also find it quite handy to know which roads the person
    who requested the ID has taken already (whatthefont etc) or what his/her guess
    is. \r\n\r\nBut to get back on topic: I haven't got a clue which font this is."

    is custom. Doesn\u2019t ring a bell for me neither."
