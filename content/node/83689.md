    appropriateness of his example yourself:\r\n\r\n<em>A chef savagely murdered his
    ex-wife after she taunted him on Facebook about reporting him to the Child Support
    Agency, a court heard today.\r\nAdam Mann, 29, beat 30-year-old Lisa Beverley
    to death with a hammer and left her body to be found by their five-year-old son.</em>\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you, Hrant, could start deleting things? For the common good?\r\n"

  body: "Perhaps it is petty, but I don't remember signing up for the Hrant-of-the-Month
    club all those years ago. And since Hrant has publicly stated that he has gotten
    \"Virtually Nothing\" from me, I don't understand why he takes me deleting my
    own content so personally. Most of which was self-serving promotional copy announcing
    this or that new release. Oh there was that \"Looking for an Alternate Term for
    Pro\" thread that he thinks I deleted to cover my tracks. What ever those tracks
    are. \r\n\r\nNews to Hrant; there is no alternative term to Pro.\r\n\r\nBut fear
    not, I've stopped deleting things, I actually do have a day job. Guys?\r\n\r\nHave
    you noticed how many once regular contributors no longer post to the Hrant-of-the-Month
    Club? Staggering when you count them up. Consider me one of them. I'll not be
    back, so you can comment on this to your heart's content, if that does it for
    you, but you'll get no response from me.\r\n\r\nAnd as for you Mr Aluminum, maybe
    you should spend less time here on the Hrant-of-the Month Club and perhaps finish
    that website of yours: http://www.darrelaustin.com/\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    to be (I can't tell what that might be since all you've been doing is disruption
    - feel free to clarify) is the equivalent of a boring and pointless cocktail party?
    Or at least, \"ruins it for many others\"? Whatever you want Typophile to be,
    try to do it yourself (here or elsewhere) but don't expect submission. Ignore
    what you don't like, and don't expect nobody to care.\r\n\r\nBTW I've been here

    Same thing, from a different point of view. My lack of contribution (your perspective)
    stems from the fact that I do not post on every thread, offering advice on things
    I know little about (my perspective)."
