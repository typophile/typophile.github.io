  boxes in the Character Edit Window? I notice that their size is apparently fixed,
  even if one scales the actual glyph. If the answer to this is in the documentation,
  I apologize for missing it-)\r\n\r\nRelated question: Is there any word on when
  DTL FM 2.5 will  be released? The website says Summer 2005 which just _cannot_ be
  right-) \r\n\r\nI'm still trying to understand what makes DTL FM so special (and
  expensive) compared to Studio5. What am I not getting?\r\n\r\nThnx for your patience
  with all my \"green\" questions!\r\n\r\nBest\r\nIdris"

  body: "The LSB/RSB boxes in the Character Edit windows of DTL Bezier- and IkarusMaster
    just indicate the character width and are an alternative (coming from the Ikarus
    system) for the LSB/RSB lines, which in current versions of DTL Bezier- and IkarusMaster
    also can be found in the Config menu. In the new 2.5 edition of DTL FontMaster,
    which was originally scheduled for summer 2005 and which will probably now be
    released February 2006 (yes, it takes always more time than expected), the content
    of the Config. menu has been enhanced and moved to \u2018Preferences\u2026\u2019,
    where everybody expects it to be.\r\n\r\nEspecially the Bezier and Ikarus editors
    have been enhanced a lot in version 2.5 of FM. The interface has been improved,
    including new icons. The drawing capabilities of the editors can\u2019t be much
    better than they are now. Also fonts can now directly be imported and subsequently
    exported in all current font formats, without the need of DataMaster. \r\n\r\nWhat
    makes FM so special, is the way it handles glyph, naming and metrics information
    and above all the powerful batch support for font production. The latter makes
    it for instance possible to easily exchange data between glyph databases, and
    to check and generate fonts in batch with a highly professional and very controllable
    and reliable output. Generating full featured OpenType fonts can\u2019t be made
    much easier than it is in FM, because of the interaction between the Character
    Layout files and the Features files. For the Features files the Adobe syntax is
    fully used and more experienced users can easily create, edit and enhance Features
    files.\r\n\r\nDTL Contour- and DataMaster are batch programs. The same functionality,
    but now only applicable for a single BE or IK glyph database at the time, has
    now been built in DTL Bezier- and IkarusMaster. The price of the editors will
    not be changed, so for less than Euro 400,- these powerful programs will become
    quite affordable. The same functionality can by the way be found in the new and
    free Lite editions of both editors, with exception of the possibility to generate
    TrueType and OpenType fonts and a limited support (up to 256 glyphs maximum instead
    of the current 65000) of BE and IK databases.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.5 of DTL FontMaster
    will be the last one available for Mac OS 9 / Classic besides, of course, the
    Window version. Edition 3.0 is targeted for Mac OS X and Windows. Probably there
    will some kind of an update program for the OS 9 users. \r\n"
