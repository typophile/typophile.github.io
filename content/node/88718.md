  I decided to ask the experts. Here you have two presentations which uses this font:\r\n\r\nhttp://speakerdeck.com/u/jrom/p/teambox-starting-and-learning\r\nhttp://speakerdeck.com/u/holman/p/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github\r\n\r\nIt's
  fancy, isn't? Love it. Thanks in advance, your help is very appreciated."

  body: Thank you, you really helped making my day. It's the first one I was looking
    for (my fault, the second slideshow doesn't have this font on the first few slides,
    but rest of it does). Once again, thank you for your amazing work.
