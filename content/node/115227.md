  body: I know about typewriterwriterfonts. I was wondering about this specific one.
    I was planning to digitalize it and wanted to know its background. Do you know
    by any chance what kind of printer used this font? Thx

  body: "I have no specific knowledge of ticket printing machines. If you draw a blank
    here you will have to undertake some research into the machines. If the ticket
    is recent, you could start by asking the ticket company what they are using. When
    I Googled \"ticket machines\" I received 17 million hits. Must be some specific
    info available on the web.\r\nDon"
