body: "For my \"If ________ were a font, what would it be?\" assignment, I chose Harry
  Houdini. No, I'm not magic-obsessed (a la Gob Bluth), and I'm not even remotely
  tricky or have any slight-of-hand ability. I DO, however, enjoy pretty much anything
  that happened a long time ago. The case of Harry Houdini was always one of those
  oddly tragic stories to me.  He didn't die doing one of his tricks or anything,
  but instead was punched in the stomach so hard that it caused internal hemorrhaging.
  I'm not going out like that. Heres the tyeface that I chose to represent him: \"Angelface\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/harry_houdini_5883.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AngelFace_5627.png]"
