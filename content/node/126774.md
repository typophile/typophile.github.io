body: Looking for this classic looking serif. I came across it on Vice's snapchat
  content channel. It has a almost vintage look (kind of like EB Garamond... but not).
  Vice uses Lora as their website serif, but it's not that either. Any help would
  be much appreciated!

    Google web font that\u2019s based on Lora, but a bit beefier)."

    body: Sumana looks very close (if not exact)! It even has the straight apostrophe
      (rather than curved). Thank you!

    body: "Looking in the glyphs list in Sumana (specifically), it calls it an apostrophe,
      and considers the other curved one a \"right single quotation mark.\" Either
      way, thanks\u2014think you solved it!"
