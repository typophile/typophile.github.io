body: i believe a couple of designers have produced faces consisting of popular corporate
  logotype letters. the end result is sort of a &#34;corporate ransom note&#34; look,
  i guess you&#39;d say. i&#39;m looking for that face&#40;s&#41; as a reference for
  a project. any ideas on designers or links?
