body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project, so I was looking for some fresh
  and rarely seen but nice looking fonts. Something eye-catchy that would look good
  on business cards. its for a local small printing shop that I'm interning,and they
  asked me to do their promotional stuff. Apparently they are having to much work
  recently, but never before had an intern before or a designer to work for them.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks"

    now that Gotham has filtered down into low-end work. Take a look at the Font Bureau,
    DTL, and TEFF web sites for some really killer high-end fonts that don\u2019t
    get much use."

  body: "I suggest you look for fonts that produce interesting addresses and phone
    numbers.\r\n\r\nFor email addresses, the relationship between letters and the
    \"@\" symbol is crucial.\r\nFor phone numbers, old-style figures have more personality.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know what conventions postal codes in your part of the world follow, but
    small caps can make this aspect of typography very tasty.\r\n\r\nSo, you will
    require a text font with these sophisticated typographic features: old style figures,
    small caps, a good \"@\", (and possibly symbols for \"tel\", \"fax\" and \"cell\"?)
    \r\n\r\nIf you pursue this look, I suspect it will impress (some \"quality\")
    graphic designers into a positive opinion of your firm."
