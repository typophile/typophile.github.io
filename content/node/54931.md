  quirky idea that I'd really love to get a feedback for. \r\n\r\nThe image is linked
  below, but let me first just give a quick summary of a product. \r\n\r\nIt is a
  form of a backup software, which basically makes copies of specified files so to
  protect against the data loss due to the hardware failures and assist with the disaster
  recovery.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to look, remember your first, 3 second impressions
  and let me know what they are. Just instant associations and whether it's memorable
  and easy to recall if needed. I'm really curious how it looks to other people :-)\r\n\r\nThe

  body: Sorry for the profanity, but the first thought I was was 'fuckup.' Perhaps
    it's because of the 'f' underneath in the tagline.  Also, the tagline doesn't
    appear to be perfectly centered (if that's what you intended).  Just some thoughts.  :)  Really
    like the font BVCKUP is in, however.

  body: "Bingo :)\r\n\r\nFrankly, the f###up reference is exactly why I said it was
    a quirky idea and why I think it really helps recalling the name by the software
    function. It sounds that it needs tweaking though so that it would've not been
    <em>that</em> evident.\r\n\r\nEleanor, it is indeed not centered nor is it kerned
    for that matter. The whole thing is a rough sketch. Good point re: the 'f' in
    the tag line evoking the association, never thought about it from this angle."

    1]]\r\n<li>[[http://swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/bvckup-2.png|numero 2]]\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAny
    better in terms of profanity insinuation ?"

- body: "I too, first saw \"effed up\". Is profanity insinuation bad? I think it makes
    it memorable. We've all heard of \"Phucket\", right?\r\n\r\nIn your new example,
    the upside down 'A' feels like an arrow pointing down...which confused me momentarily
    because it insinuated \"back down\". I like the first insinuation better. :) \r\n\r\nBTW
    - Those two examples look identical to me. Am I missing something?"

    uno]]\r\n<li>[[http://swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/bvckup-3.png|numero due]]\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI
    think the second option is not bad, because V looks like an inverted A <em>and</em>
    the upper curve implies the U. Though good point it looking like a down arrow..
    \r\n\r\nBy the way turning A into an <em>up</em> arrow would match the \"backup\"
    word very well. I don't think anyone has done this before. Too bad the word itself
    is too generic and not really an option for a product name."

    is the original in its spruced up form:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shot_1284189046_6524.png]\r\n\r\nand
    the same in application on the website:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvckup-1_4731.png]\r\n\r\nand
    on the blog:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvckup-2_3667.png]\r\n\r\nThen,
    I had it reworked for the second version.\r\n\r\nKept the \"inverted A / delta
    / shield\" symbol, but switching from the uppercase Gotham to the lowercase Alright
    Sans <- my new absolute favorite sans (Thanks, Jackson!). The original logo was
    a bit too grand and pompous for what the software was/is and it needed to be simpler.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvckup-3_4960.png]\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    the logo landed itself naturally to a quirky holiday greeting card (for the mailing
    list subscribers), and this is what I wanted to share in the first place: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvckup-4_6402.jpg]\r\n\r\nHope
    you, guys, like it. And in any case - \r\n\r\n\xA1s\u0250\u026F\u0287s\u0131\u0279\u0265\u0254
