  body: "Riccardo and Electrolyze, I hate to burst your bubbles, but the capital M
    in Univers has a center stroke that touches the baseline. The M in the sample
    has a center stroke that stops above the baseline by a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the leg of the R in Univers is curved/convex. The leg of the R in the sample is
    straight.\r\n\r\nThe sample may be to too small to definitively identify, but
    it is not Univers."

  body: "Kevin, you're right, of course. I was blinded by the |Q| and the fact that
    the app contains 8 fonts named  U47, U48, U49, U57, U58, U59, U67, and Uv39, which
    seem to nicely match Univers' styles and weights.\r\nIt could be a customisation,
    I suppose."

  body: Even after intense looking (better samples [[http://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/79588167/hd/4228ff3bf65412e62cb999b7126f4b15.jpg|here]]

    can't see anything else than various weights and styles of DIN (Condensed, Light,
    Bold...). If you still doubt, try asking [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/Orsay-Museum/10941191|Jeremy
    Perrot-Minot]].

  body: "The Mus\xE9e d'orsay has a budget sufficient to commission its own versions
    of Din, and this is also a possibility. The French government does not skimp on
    spending for culture. So for the larger fonts I would go with DIN Condensed, perhaps
    customized.\r\nDone"
