body: "I am probably going to be setting some text for ghost/paranormal stories some
  time in the next 3 months in a new Lit journal so I thought I would start looking
  for a suitable text face for it. What I have come up with so far is Stormtype's
  Walbaum. It feels victorian and the words 'ghost' & 'scream' look great in it. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-52-walbaum-text\r\n\r\nIt's
  early days yet and I feel far from stumped - but still, I thought it would be a
  fun thread: What would you use & why?\r\n"

    would be a grave mistake to overlook <a href=\"http://exclamachine.com/Typefaces/!Lestatic.html\">Lestatic</a>
    as a display type. And of course, the old House Monster fonts collection is to
    die for."

    for this kind of thing. Actually there are some sweet looking Storm display faces
    too - but deciding on text is tougher! And that is the core of my question.'

    it's a great example anyway.

    one of the revival faces from the 1910s or 20s?

  body: "darnnit! i didn't know there was already a digital version of Goudy's Italian
    Oldstyle. oh well.\r\n\r\nbut to advise on the original question: i think you'd
    want something just <em>a bit</em> more menacing (somehow) than Walbaum. if we're
    sticking with Storm, I might try something a bit more on the fauvist side, such
    as <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-43-serapion\">Serapion</a>
    or maybe <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-40-regent\">Regent</a>."

  body: 'If they''re good ghost stories, they''ll be plenty scary without any help
    from the typeface---so I think it''s best to keep the effect of the text face
    subtle. Caslon, Storm''s Walbaum, Trump Mediaeval, I think they''d all work. Baskerville
    too. I might even try Elysium to see the effect. It''s a little heavier and edgier
    than many text faces. I once used it to set a novel about the ultimate solution
    to bad drivers: nail them to crosses overlooking the Don Valley Parkway.'

    an extended text in it regardless of my admiration for the face. Elysium is interesting.
    Baskerville has the right feeling but it always seems a little too daylight and
    upright and so maybe a little too safe for me in this case. '

    is a good example of the feeling I want. I will have look at what it's set in.
    I seem to recall thinking that the text face was less carefully chosen than the
    cover's and that it was maybe less than an ideal match to the cover. But I haven't
    looked at it in a while. I will look again. Andrew, what version of Baskerville
    do you favor & why? I should look at the p22 faces as well...\r\n"

  body: Post Mediaeval---there's another possibility, although I find the l.c. "a"
    is slightly distracting in text settings and hence have only ever used it for
    semi-display text and titling. The typeface certainly has character (kind of makes
    me think of old castles) but, except for that darned "a", is not too far out for
    extended text. It doesn't have oldstyle numerals, however, the numerals are less
    than cap height and are kind of semi-oldstyle; they blend in quite well.

  body: Post Mediaeval does have a certain desirable tension. But I don't think it's
    really a text face. More a pull quote or headline sort of thing to my eyes. Ghastly
    Panic is really not a 'text font' Billy... Thanks to you both just the same.
