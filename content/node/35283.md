  is a problem for new learners in being able to display the \r\nThai script in a
  larger size.\r\nhttp://www.thailandqa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=15033\r\nFirefox
  has a work around for this, but for whatever reasons not all posters\r\nare or are
  willing to use Firefox.\r\nThere are many options for adjusting the view both within
  windows and IE, but \r\nnone of these including personalized CSS (tools/internet
  options/accesibility)\r\nare quite whats needed. \r\nPosters on the forum YES can
  choose to alter the size of the script posted.\r\nBut not all learners are at the
  same level. And learners cetrainly don't want to be\r\nrestricted to posts made
  larger for them.\r\nPosts allso often contain both English and Thai and only the
  Thai needs to be enlarged.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering... Is it possible within designing
  a font, to pre-determine it's display size to be considerably larger? I'm wondering
  if that is even a value that can \r\nbe controled by designing a custom font?\r\n\r\nYour
  insights appreciated.\r\nRick"

    it works exactly that way. In font creation programs, the letters are drawn within
    a grid that is 1000 x 1000 units, and when you are ready to output the font files
    you decide which point sizes you want. But you can still make the font any size
    you want once you have set some text in a graphics or layout program...\r\n"

  body: "Mr. Cordoba, thank you for your reply.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly getting a little
    excited, hopefully I don't \r\nmisconstrue or jump to impossible conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you say \"1000 x 1000 units\" I'm guessing this is the way font smiths measure
    the number pixells within a standardized space.\r\n\r\nAnd when you are saying
    \"decide which point sizes you want\"\r\nI will understand this to be the varying
    sizes of text that are displayed as I adjust my font size in a cocument or can
    see when I open TTF files in C:\\WINDOWS\\Fonts with their poit sizes listed beside
    them.\r\n\r\nAnd then you finally said \"make the font any size you want once
    you have set some text in a graphics or layout program...\" Which I appreciate
    and understand, but unfortunately is not usefull for my immediate needs.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm hoping might be possible, is that when you \"output\" the Font files, are
    there whithin the TTF file actually several copies of varying \"Point sizes\"
    ?\r\nIs it somehow possible while outputting the \"Point sizes\" to rename/reconfigure
    the values of them ?\r\nWhat I mean is, is it possible to corrupt the file (of
    a custom build) so that a 48 point letter is labeled, and read as being an 18
    point ? \r\nI still haven't convinced myself that i'm coherent in my meaning.....
    I wan't the Thai text to display larger than the English. If the software is displaying
    the page at a given point size, could the Thai text come out larger ?\r\n\r\n(I've
    had an after thought, would that mean that the space between the lines would be
    over-run? Could I then Build 2 sets of fonts, and English and a Thai, The English
    one having exagerated blank space above/bellow the letters to compensate ?)\r\n\r\nAgain
    any insight is appreciated."

    this problem with the code for the website, but you already mentioned that CSS
    and other methods weren't working.\r\n\r\nMaybe I missed something, but it seems
    to me that you should be able to program one font (for English) to show up in
    a certain size, and program the Thai font for a larger size than that."

    people running the board say they have run the\r\ngamut trying to resolve the
    problem from the weboards\r\nsoftware side. They have recently done an upgrade
    so,\r\nit's unlikely that change will come again for a while.\r\n\r\nI will learn
    more about fonts for a while, maybe make a\r\nset of my own to appreciate what's
    involved (not artisticaly\r\nI can see in \"Typograpy 110\" there is great deal
    more than simply understanding, and my artistic side is undevoloped)\r\nIf there
    is nothing there I will study the software of the web board for myself.\r\n Ultimately
    there is FireFox, but that won't help others on the board. And though the internet
    is a small fragment of the media that typography/caligraphy expresses itself,
    your likely still aware that IE for better or worse commands the lions share of
    the market."

    the jist of the idea.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to illegitimately use or otherwise
    copy the  work of any designer/publisher. I do have friends who are artists. Though
    they are musicians I appreciate how much hard work and time artists put into their
    work only to have them stolen without credit or apreciation shown for their work.
    \r\n\r\nPermision (at a price if affordable) would be fine. If not I would have
    to explore how difficult it would be to make my own (which would involve buying
    software).\r\n\r\nThe idea that \"all your users would need to download and install
    the font.\" is 'Exactly' what I'm after, that would leave it open to the individual
    to choose whether it improved the readability for themselves.\r\n\r\nIf you have
    some time, can you give me a bit of an idea of how I could proceed ? How much
    would it cost to have someone make such a font for me ? Would I need to produce
    a font set for both English and Thai ? Whom could I approach ?\r\n\r\nI'd really
    like to know how I could move forward with this, so any offerings are appreciated.\r\nThank
    you\r\nRick"

  body: "I can see one more problem:\r\nIf you increase the size of some glyphs (letters),
    then you will have to increase the size of the em, which increases the line-spacing.
    So lines without any Thai letters will look very widely separated.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    it should be pretty simple.\r\n\r\nOnce you have permission from the owner of
    the font (the designer or publisher) --- alternatively use an open-source font,
    get a font-editing program. I would suggest FontForge (http://fontforge.sf.net)
    if you're using Linux or Mac (some people here don't like it, but this is an easy
    enough job, and I'm a FontForge fan anyway). Using FontForge on windows is a bit
    more difficult.\r\n\r\nIf you choose FontForge:\r\n\r\nStart FontForge. Open the
    font you want to edit. Select the glyphs you want to resize. Choose Element->Transformations->Transform...
    Set the origin to \"Glyph Origin\". In the drop-down box, change \"Move\" to \"Scale
    Uniformly\", and adjust the number to, say, 200%. Click OK.\r\n\r\nChoose Element->Font
    Info->General. Adjust the \"Em Size\" by the same factor as you scaled the glyphs
    (if you chose 200%, double the em size, etc.). Click OK.\r\n\r\nChoose Generate->Generate
    Fonts, change things as you see fit, and click Save.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps.\r\n\r\n"

    at the software and I don't think installation should be a problem. I have custom
    built PC for video edit and theres lots of room on the drives for that software.
    As well your post seems to make the task sound simple enough the way you provided
    a walk-through for me.\r\n\r\nI have 2 more questions if anyone has the time?\r\n\r\nSomeone
    recently messaged me saying\r\n \"As all those Fonts are available for free Download
    I assume that it is allowed to use them, but I am not sure so.\"\r\nIs that assumption
    a fair one ? Does this free distribution simply limit me to using it as is or
    am I allso permited to alter the font as I intend to ?\r\n\r\nSecond question;
    The spcecial requirements for displaying Thai text, is this problem software side
    only ? Or does it complicate the way in which the fonts are made\r\nhttp://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/ZzzThai/thailang/index.html#problems\r\n
    i.e. is there more to creating a Thai font than I am understanding at this point
    ? Or are Glyphs just glyphs no matter the character set ?\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nRick\r\n"

  body: "Being allowed to use the font (and even distribute it) does NOT necessarily
    mean you are allowed to edit it. When you got the font, you should have got a
    licence with it (if you didn't, it's probably pirated in the first place).\r\n\r\nBut
    there are open source Thai fonts. These allow you to use, distribute and modify
    freely (they may or may not require you to pass on these rights on to the people
    you give/sell the font to). The Thai Linux Working Group and NECTEC has made several
    fonts (apparently of good quality) under the GPL (open source; you have to distribute
    modifications under the same licence). You can get them at\r\nhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/thai/thaifonts-scalable/nectec/
    and http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/thai/thaifonts-scalable/tlwg/ (these
    sites offer \".sfd\" files, which can only be opened in FontForge).\r\n\r\nYes,
    the difficulties of Thai fonts affect type designers too, albeit in a different
    way. However, you should not be affected, as the font you choose should already
    have this done (if it is of decent quality)."
