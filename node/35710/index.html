  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">To Whom It May Concern:

I am applying to a commercial real estate certificate program and I am picking fonts for my resume, which I must submit. I'm new to thinking about what fonts to use; in the past, I've stuck to either Garamond or Times New Roman.

Some notes:
-The resume fits on one page.
-I want to convey freshness and stability. 
-Most of the the experience on the resume relates to mapping, databases, and real estate.
-I was playing around with Helvetica for headings, and Times New Roman for other text. It looked OK, but not great.

I welcome suggestions. Also, I'd love links to well-designed resumes.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respect,

Michael</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Helvetica and Times wouldn't be my first choice (I'd rather see Helvetica and Garamond, if you have Garamond), but you're on the right track keepng it simple with two conservative fonts, a serif for the text and a sans for the titles. In the past I've preferred to use just a serif font, utilizing italic and/or larger sizes for  headings. Layout is important too: use white space to your advantage to set off different section and to keep it all looking open and inviting. Make your text large enough to be easily read (10 points or so, depending on the typeface), but not overly large.

I've laid out my own resumes in the past using a two-column format: a left column, about third of the width between my outer margins, has my name and address at the top, and major headings (experience, education) beow, with the text of the sections occupying the right two thirds. This keeps the length of text lines to around four inches, which is easier to read than text spanning maybe six inches on 8.5 x 11 stock. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Do you have a Mac or PC? Are you interested in purchasing a font or using one you own (have a license for)?

If you have a Mac, it ships with Hoefler Text (I think it still does anyway), which is excellent. If you have a PC only, I'd recommend using Georgia instead of Times. Georgia italics are particularly nice. Also, Garamond is better (fresher) than Times.

For a sans, use Helvetica, and avoid Verdana. 

Instead of the default 12 point that Word will give you, you'll get a more refined look with 10.5 or 11 point text. 

Good luck in your job search.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't agree totally with the type sizes recommended. If your resume is short, increase the type size. It will look bigger, and thus longer. I also want the interviewer to read everything, so would go with a minimum of 12 point body type so that they will read the whole thing. Anything smaller, IMO, will make them toss it if your qualifications are iffy. The larger type almost forces them to read it.

I totally agree with Hoefler Text and Georgia, which Joe recommended. They are both great looking fonts, as well as being modern and easy to read.

I prefer sanserif fonts for headlines. It is just the way I was brought up in the art field. I started in newspapers and always preferred the the sanserif to the serif fonts for headlines. It is cleaner and stands out from the body type, IMO. But that is not necessarily the rule, as many newspapers today use serifed faces for their headlines. Use what you like in that case. It really depends upon what you want to relate, and to whom you are relating it to. Both work well under different circumstances.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If your resume is a bit short, I recommend NOT using a larger size of type to try to fill up the page---it can wind up looking like you've done so deliberately to overcome a perceived shortcoming. Better to use a smart design with lots of white space.</div>
