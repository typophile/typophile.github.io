  Edumacators</strong></a> topic area (located within <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/2\">Special
  Interest Groups</a> topics) I invite members to weigh in on the term \"Edumacators.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral
  members (hopefully more will join in) are interested in making it into a resource
  area not only for teachers but for anyone interested in furthering type and typographic
  education. I do not (nor want) the \"power\" to change the topic name, but I do
  want the title to be more inviting to Forum members and \"lurkers.\" \r\n\r\nThat
  being said, I hope the topic will not become an excuse for \"hot debates\" and stray
  off-topic.\r\n\r\n<em>My vote</em>:\r\nI prefer \"Type Education\" since I feel
  the term <em>Type</em> is inclusive of both type design and typography, and that
  <em>Education</em> is open to both teachers and individuals seeking informational
  resources."

    think any of these is fine: 'Type Education','Type Educators' , 'Typographic Education'.
    Even 'Typographic Edumacators' or 'Typographic Edumacation' would be okay with
    me. For me it isn't so much the label as the content.\r\n\r\n"

    in with a vote to change it to whatever else. 'Triple bat oomingmack pie' would
    suit me fine. As would Norbert's 'Type Education'. FWIW, I do have a beef with
    the term 'educator', so if we could leave that out of it, I'd be grateful and
    in someone's debt.\r\n\r\nLet this be a lesson to me not to drink a six-pack of
    Pabst and then post to Typophile. (Which isn't a dig on red-necks -- I'm the proud
    owner of an East Tennessee hillbilly heritage and I actually do drink Pabst, enjoy
    car repair and light construction. Respond to Personal Ad #1459.)"

    my position that \"type\" and \"typography\" have a little teeny bit of overlap,
    but are otherwise as different as night and day). But I will save my energy for
    the Education panel / forum / whatchamacallit in the imminent Helsinki ATypI conference.
    It is deliberately planned to be open-ended, to give people present the opportunity
    to float ideas and opinions. I know a good few people who teach and follow Typophile
    will be there, and I hope they attend (I do not know if it would be possible to
    webcast the session, but it would be interesting to field comments from a distant
    audience). \r\n\r\n"
