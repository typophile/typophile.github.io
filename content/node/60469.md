  body: "I think you nailed it here, Paul.\r\nThe ampersand must be from another typeface.\r\nProbably
    because the one in Requiem is a bit flimsy."

  body: Its not at all Requiem. Just look at 'M' and 'W'. They are quite different
    than those of Requiem. Also note that all the characters have the same exact height
    whereas in Requiem, J is a bit taller, C and D are shorter etc. Also the font
    used is sharp whereas Requiem has rough surfaces.

    what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\r\nAnd in your sample the
    \u2018J\u2019 <em>does</em> descend below the baseline."

    at Dafont and 1001fonts websites so I was confused.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\nCan
    you please tell me what font is used for the '&' in the first image?\r\n"

  body: Might look like secondary text is also from H&FJ. Geometric "C" and "O" feel
    like Gotham even at this size.

    image?\r\n\r\nAlso it would be very helpful if anybody can tell me where I can
    get Requiem font for free. It costs $199 on H&FJ website which, I think, is too
    much for personal use.\r\n\r\nI have searched Pirate Bay and other torrent websites
    but haven't found it. If there is anyone who has bought this font, it would be
    very great of him to share it with me.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance."

    I didn't know how to behave here and what to speak, thus my offences.\r\n\r\nI
