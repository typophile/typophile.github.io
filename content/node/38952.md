body: "When I have a series of paragraphs beginning with bullets and a blank line
  in between them, I run into a typesetting problem. I cannot separate them with a
  non-breaking space, because that causes the last line of each paragraph to stretch
  across the page. So I have two options: set the paragraphs with an extra line\u2019s
  worth of spacing after them, which is fine for me, but is going to cause problems
  if someone who doesn\u2019t know too much about Indesign gets the file and can\u2019t
  figure out what\u2019s going on. The other option is to just leave the spaces and
  apply the bullet style to each paragraph individually, but that\u2019s tedious.
  Is there a third way that beats either of my two?"

    end of the line.\r\nBut I really don't unterstand why you use a blank line in
    the first place? You should better try to achieve this with paragraph styles only.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you've hit on the fundamental problem with producing very \"clean\"
    ID files. For an experienced users, having most of the design relegated to styles
    can be a godsend, both for time and spec's sake. But for Johnny Wordperfect, even
    soft returns (which clean files often dispense with in favor of space after, wrap-around,
    indent-to-here, etc.) can be a source of confusion. \r\n\r\nIf that isn't that
    huge a concern, though, Ricardo's approach is certainly the best.\r\n"
