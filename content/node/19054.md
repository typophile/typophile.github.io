  body: "I think it's just \"dot\", quite distinct from \"period\"(.)\r\nThe \"dot
    accent\" used in some languages (eg Polish over z) is the exact same dot."

  body: According to Adam Twardoch's <a href="http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/kropka.html">diacritics
    howto</a>, I think it should be called "kropka". I know that's technically the
    name of the polish diacritic, but typographically it's exactly the same as the
    dot on the i, so why not?

  body: "Although what Paul says sounds familiar, looks like OED agrees with Si (see
    1b):\r\n\r\n<strong>tittle, <em>n.</em></strong>\r\n <strong>1.</strong> A small
    stroke or point in writing or printing.    <strong>a.</strong> Orig. rendering
    L. <em>apex</em> \u2018point, tip\u2019, applied in classical L. to any minute
    point or part of a letter, also to the mark over a long vowel, as <em>\xE1</em>,
    later also to a line indicating an abbreviation. More recently applied also to
    the Spanish <em>tilde</em> or circumflex over <em>\xF1</em>, formerly to the cedilla
    under <em>\xE7</em>. By extension, any stroke or tick with a pen.\r\n  <strong>b.</strong>
    The dot over the letter <em>i</em>; a punctuation mark; a diacritic point over
    a letter; any one of the Hebrew and Arabic vowel-points and accents; also, a pip
    on dice.\r\n  <strong>&dagger;c.</strong> A name for the (usually) three dots,
    following the letters and contractions, in the alphabet on horn-books, where it
    is usually followed by <em>Est Amen</em>; so that <strong><em>tittle est Amen</em></strong>
    came to be used for \u2018the end or conclusion\u2019. <em>Obs.</em>\r\n  \r\netc...\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nEver
