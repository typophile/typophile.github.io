body: "Thanks for visiting the Typographic Edumacators topic area.\r\n\r\nFollowing
  through on simple exercises that might be useful in teaching typography to graphic
  design students:\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about some of the routine activities
  some of us old typographers did that helped sharpen our \"typographic eye.\"\r\nSetting
  lines of metal type and then putting each character back into the typecase.\r\n\r\nSounds
  like the most mundane of activities, but we set lines of copy that was visually
  upside down and backwards.\r\nIn other words, mind your 'p' and 'q' and 'b' and
  'd'.  Eventually reading metal type became easier. At one point I could amaze friends
  by reading pages aloud quickly from a book held upside down... I have a hard time
  doing that nowadys.\r\n\r\nMaybe there was something useful in training the mind
  to quickly differentiate characters regardless of orientation. \r\n\r\nI think I
  know enough about Flash that I could put together a rough prototype.\r\nHere is
  a rough sketch of <a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/Aimages/upside.gif\" target=\"new\"><strong>Upside
  Down & Backwards</strong></a>.\r\n<ul>\r\nThe basic premise is that a word or phrase
  (typewritter styled letters) would show up in the white window below the \"metal\"
  characters.\r\n<li>All the student has to do is \"set\" the words by clicking the
  mouse on each successive character until they complete the line.</li>\r\n<li>There
  is no time limit during training, but the game starts with a timer ticking away.
  Hey... it's a production shop!</li>\r\n<li>Difficulty variables could be changing
  the typeface or reducing the point size.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nMaybe, even if the excercise
  had no real value in improving design skills, it might be fun from an historic point
  of view.\r\n\r\n"

    file. Maybe there is a student out there with the flash skills... I might need
    some more convincing to really want to spend time at it though.

    'metal' type ( could be anything - wood, platic metal etc ) for sale in design
    bookstores to play with, and especially if it could be held in a line & inked
    and then pressed into paper - you might have a typophile stocking stuffer...\r\n\r\nYou
    could offer them in classic faces and maybe one recent one. So people would want
    to collect them. Then they would be playing your game, having fun & making you
    a profit. Win-win & all that sort of thing."

    I have many years experience developing in flash, but am learning director and

    it in when I can. I'm actually working on something for school using director

    type. That would help cut down drawing time, plus it would visually simulate the
    experience of composing a line of hot type.\r\n\r\nIf you build a basic engine,
    it would be possible to add an optional feature to \"select font.\" Imagine the
    degrees of difficulty between setting lines of old hot metal Franklin Gothic,
    Garamond Italic, Brush Script and even Engravers' Old English (M.F. Benton).\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "True, Eben,I think a ran a little too quickly with concepts (it's fun though).\r\n\r\nLet's
    go back to the original intent of this topic. The ultimate goal of the project
    is to help stimulate interest in typography and type design, and to help develop
    initial skills and sensitivity in those who are interested. The target group is
    students in general graphic design programs and novices who seek improvement.\r\n\r\nThe
    premise of \"Upside down & backwards\" is based on simple observations of routine
    activities done by typesetters/typographers, and the theory is that composing
    lines of metal type helped to sharpen character recognition. All theory and no
    evidence that it's a valid premise.\r\n\r\nSo, with that as the basis, developing
    a prototype is more important than visual embellishments at this time. I do agree
    that outlines would move it along faster.\r\n\r\nAs we are convinced that the
    whole idea is worth developing, then features such as changing \"fonts\" or even
    photographic images of type can be debated. I would just be happy to see a skeletal
    concept piece working.\r\n"

  body: "Agreed. \r\n\r\nJust to clarify - I was thinking that it *might* be just
    as easy to tap a local typeface compared to importing vector outlines as art for
    the purpose. Also Grabbing outlines might viaolate a EULA - would it? - but using
    a local installed font would not. If you are using an installed font then building
    font choice into the project would probably be easy. Then again if the program
    itself resides online then you would have to go with sprites ( bitmaps ) or vector
    data anyway... So maybe I have argued myself back the other way.\r\n\r\nI might
    be wrong about any of these points - but that was what I had been thinking about.\r\n\r\nThink

  body: "> Modes: what various modes are there - production and learning\r\n\r\nI
    guess I would start by just making it simple. I will describe a deluxe version
    & you should maybe toss out 50% or more of it to create a basic engine. Let me
    see if I can describe what I think should happen... You get a word: ( random,
    but the best would be a list which uses the most common words more! ) and you
    have a case of letters ( in reverse display ) to build the word with. The word
    should maybe be big-ish. The letter not small but smaller, and small because you
    need to show all 26X2 + maybe numbers & punctuation.\r\n\r\nSo maybe you start
    with lower case & then go to upper & lower & then numbers & then punctuation too.\r\n\r\n>
    Interface: what features on the interface - what navigation/means of control\r\n\r\nI
    think it should be mouse driven in terms of play. And you need ( timer? ) restart,
    score, high score ( world high score? ) , and quit buttons. The score & the rest
    of the info on otrher screens might be displayed backwards too.  the game might
    say 'eybdoog' when you quit for instance... ( with letters reversed of course
    ).\r\n\r\n>Graphics: roughly what size do the lettrers need to be?\r\n\r\nI think
    the target word should perhaps be 7-9 characters max and could take up 1/5th of
    the screen & the letters & other interface UI would take up the rest. The letters
    etc will size themselves based on what is left I would guess...\r\n\r\n>Layout:
    what particular layout considerations are there - is the image provided indicitive?\r\n\r\nNot
    a question for me.\r\n\r\nTake all this with a grain of salt."
