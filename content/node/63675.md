  body: "Something called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura-no-2/|Futura No.
    2]] is not too far off, at least in the text. The j has a hook, unlike regular
    Futura. The numerals and ampersand are not from this font (which is only close,
    but not identical).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    must be my luck day because they are using TypeKit or something to embed the font.
    After a quick search of the source I found a javascript file loading the font.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.friendlynoise.se/fzn/wp-content/themes/fzn/inc/Mullino_400-Mullino_500.font.js\r\n\r\n========\r\n/*!\r\n

  body: "In this case I noticed that the type on the website wasn't saved as an image.
    From there I just did a 'View Source' in the browser and found the .js file reference
    in the <head> that loads the font. Append that link to the site URL and you can
    view the javascript.\r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions just drop me an email.
    I'd be happy to provide a step-by-step so you can see it in action with this example."
