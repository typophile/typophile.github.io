  body: Looks like some sort of Baskerville Bold. Don&#39;t have time to give it a
    search right now...

  body: Shouldn&#39;t a Baskerville have a bottom serif on the &#39;C&#39;  <BR>and
    vertical stress on the top serif?

  body: Oops. You&#39;re obviously right. But in defense of my ignorance, I found
    <i>one</i> <a href="http://philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AB80324003P1" target="_blank">
    Baskerville</a> lacking the bottom serif. ;-&#41; And without vertical stress
    on the top. Still not the right face though.

  body: I was just thinking out loud, Nathan. I haven&#39;t got   <BR>time to go ID-hunting
    for the moment, so I just  <BR>added my little observation. On hindsight I feel  <BR>quite
    cheap commenting on your efforts when I&#39;m  <BR>doing nothing myself... :/

  body: No problem at all - I&#39;m supposed to be teaching right now anyway, but
    instead I&#39;m Typophil-ing. It was sloppy observation on my part anyhow :-&#41;
    So class is over and I still haven&#39;t found an ID...sorry Jonathan.

  body: 'Tough cookie: Rookledge&#39;s was no help at all. I fear  <BR>I&#39;ll need
    to delve into an extensive FontBook search  <BR>in order to ID that one. <BR>
    <BR>It reminds me a bit of <a href="http://philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF00763203P1"
    target="_blank"> FF Celeste</a> in atmosphere if  <BR>not as an accurate match.'
