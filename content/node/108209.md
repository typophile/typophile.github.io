  the Hawarth Beside catalog, but cannot find any information on their site. It is
  super thin but the characteristic that gets me is the slightly curved crossbar on
  the uppercase A.\r\n Please excuse the very large image, its the only way you could
  see the curve i mentioned.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/besidebrochure11-pdf-8873-4_5739.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The font is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/reserves/sevigne/|Sevigne]] by
    Michael Jarboe. Lots of contextual alternatives in this one, reminiscent of the
    alternates of Lubalin's Avant Garde Gothic.
