  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,
I'm working on a logo for a media (Advertising/Marketing) agency, the name is just initials with the letters s, e, s, I've been playing around with different concepts but keep on getting stuck because of the duplicate "s" letters. 

The goal is to create more of an 'Identity' than a logo, I'm thinking of implementing [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=vista%20sans|Vista Sans]] as the general brand typeface (a custom font would probably not be affordable).

Any suggestions or direction?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">BEP ... seems like there might be some interesting possibilities.

but we need some questions answered ... :D

playing around = what exactly?

does that mean sketching on paper ... or digital ideations — illustrator, or some other program?

do they want upper or lowercase? (i'd imagine upper).

any particular style they are trying to convey with the letterforms? Do they have a site we could see?
Any background on the company? What *exactly* do they do? Who are their competitors? Who are their customers?

what are they currently using for a logo? Where are they based? Do they want something monogram-ish? Do they want a graphic device or just the three letters?

are there periods between S.E.S. ?

kinda difficult to assist b/c Step 1 = research and we don't have any info. :)

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Brian,
Thanks for your interest and response, here are some answers.

<cite>playing around = what exactly? does that mean sketching on paper ... or digital ideations — illustrator, or some other program?</cite>
Playground is in Adobe Illustrator of course, I didn't post drafts because I don't really like any of them.

<cite>do they want upper or lowercase? (i’d imagine upper).</cite>
They currently use both, I prefer lowercase rather which would give it more of a modern feel.

<cite>Do they have a site we could see?</cite>
Website doesn't show much, here is a [[http://www.sesmedia.com/|link]].

<cite>Any background on the company? What *exactly* do they do? Who are their competitors? Who are their customers?</cite>
This is the interesting part, I can't elaborate much because some of the details are confidential, but here are the basics. They are a young and fresh think tank group aspiring to reach the american orthodox jewish sector just like other ethnic marketing agencies (e.g. WingLatino, Vidal Partnership, Alma DDB, etc.) are already doing with the hispanic sector for example.

They offer insight to a sector that corporate america cannot reach with conventional media, they serve as a link to a community which is mostly secluded from mainstream america. That is also the reason why they virtually have no competition to date, because they are from within this marketplace and are therefore very exclusive in understanding the language and subtle nuances of this specific market.

<cite>what are they currently using for a logo? Where are they based?</cite>
See previous [[http://www.sesmedia.com/|link]] please.

<cite>Do they want something monogram-ish?</cite>
I don't think monogram style would be appropriate, I envision something 'corporate', a clean modern identity, I might be wrong but a monogram to me conveys a traditional printshop etc.

<cite>Do they want a graphic device or just the three letters? are there periods between S.E.S. ?</cite>
A graphic element would be cool if it could be incorporated, no periods between letters.</div>

Try sketching on paper. There's much more flexibility and wiggle room with pencil roughs than with beziers.

Another idea would be to focus on the graphic and use a nice clean readable typeface. Looking at the other companies you mentioned, they all seem to have very safe, clean logos.

In any case, have fun & good luck.</div>

Along those lines, could you do a more rectilinear version - I'm picturing something like a Greek [[http://images.google.com/images?q=greek%20key%20pattern&hl=en|key pattern]] that reverses direction. Maybe that'd be too architectural.</div>
