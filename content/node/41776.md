    little breaks in the strokes are pretty cool.\r\n\r\nJust wondering, do you get
    clients to approve designs when they\u2019re still on paper, or do you vectorize
    it first?"

    piece because it would have saved me alot of time, but I like to trace it so I
    can fix anything that I think may need fixing.\r\n\r\n_Charles"
