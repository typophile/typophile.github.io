body: "I am working on a second edition of a phrase book and need some help finding
  a font.\r\n\r\nThe phrase book has three columns - English, Spanish and Phonetics\r\n\r\nI
  will use Helvetica 9pt for the first two columns - I like it for its readability.
  Plus, with my book design, I need an uncluttered, very legible font, and I'm happy
  with Helvetica.\r\n\r\nPreviously I used Comic Sans for the Phonetics column. I
  liked it because it was clearly VERY different from Helvetica. Since my phonetics
  is a language of my own creation, I like the very informal feeling of Comic Sans.
  However, in this edition, I want to decrease the font size to 8. At 8pt, the distinction
  between Comic Sans Regular and Comic Sans Bold largely disappears. (The distinction
  between bold and regular text is VERY important since it tells the user which syllable
  to stress.)\r\n\r\nI've been unable to find a good alternative font with the same
  characteristics. By the way, I'd love to find a font which also offers italic and
  perhaps several weights for greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nEven though standard serif
  fonts make a strong contrast with Helvetica, I don't like them for this application.
  They are too serious looking for my purposes.\r\n\r\nThanks for any ideas that you
  can give me.\r\n\r\nKathy\r\n\r\n"

    people on this website will advise you strongly \r\nagainst Comic Sans. There
    are much more attractive solutions for\r\na 'friendly' sans serif face. Look at
    Courier Sans (www.lineto.com).\r\nOr Helvetica Rounded. It provides quite distinct
    variation to 'regular' \r\nHelvetica and is 'friendly' looking. \r\n\r\nPhil"

    Highlander Book Italic </a>might be another possibility.\r\n\r\nYou also might
    look at OurType's Fresco family, with a serif, and sans, an \"informal\" and a
    script. I don't know how well the script would work at 8 points, but Fresco is
    more compact than the faces you're using, so you might be able to go up a point
    with the space you'd save. Fresco Informal would work at smaller sizes, I think.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know how to link to individual samples on OurType's site, but go <a href=\"http://www.ourtype.be/home.html\">here</a>,
    wait for the animation to finish, then select from the choices.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for all your suggestions. The rounded or italic font options COULD
    possibly work but I think I still prefer an even MORE informal looking font. I
    will try the fonts you mentioned ...\r\n\r\nDepending on the font, I may be able
    to go 9pt. (I'm using 9pt with the Helvetica.) The font must be quite readable
    and have both lower and upper case letters (which rules out the Ulixa font).\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the ideas ... and any more that you may have.\r\n\r\nKathy\r\n\r\n"

    you like to lend your phonetics more credibility?\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep it
    informal, but maintain readability and some authority <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PRC.123364.0.0\">Bryant</a>
