  Now read this<strong> at Typotechnica this year, and on page 22 You can read Maxim
  Zhukovs comments to Gary Munch regarding his design of the uppercase cyrillic D.\r\nZhukov
  suggests that the diagonal should be slightly convex instead of concave.\r\nNow,
  every other cyrillic design in this book show concave D:s.\r\nI'm curious if it's
  only in the context of Munchs specific design it made sense or what? \r\nThe reason
  I'm asking is because I feel to understand so much more of the cyrillic alphabet,
  and I'd appreciate anyone who can point me towards cyrillic enlightenment in general.\r\n\r\nYours,</strong>
  \r\n\r\n\u0192"

  body: i believe that this was a design-specific suggestion and not applicable to
    <em>every</em> cyrillic design. at least that's how i remember reading it.

    slightly arched ascending diagonal in the De and de is a feature in some 18th-century
    Russian typefaces (e.g., AZ Paragon Nord, shown in the book you are referring
    to). The strongly arched diagonal in the De, de, El and el (sometimes in the A)
    is typical for the Art-Nouveau designs (e.g., ITC Benguiat, ITC Benguiat Gothic)...
