  characthers are the &#34;S&#34; and &#34;R&#34; which make them look different from
  the many look-a-likes. <BR> <BR>The font is NOT: <BR>Compacta <BR>Haettenschwiller
  <BR>Impact <BR>Soft Hits <BR>Gogo Big <BR>Gogo Squat <BR>California Grotesk <BR>
  <BR> <BR> <BR>Here are the links:  They are a bit embarassing, but, oh well <BR>

  <BR> <BR>The font was also used on the Johnny English movie poster. Like the previous
  pictures, it&#39;s the text in the grey and red on this link: <BR> <BR><a href="http://images.art.com/images/products/regular/10104000/10104782.jpg"

  body: Looks to me like they took something similar to the weight and proportions
    of Helvetica Ultra Compressed and stretched it horizontally. &#40;It&#39;s not
    Helvetica Ultra Compressed--I tried it. Some of the characters are close matches,
    but others are quite different.&#41;

  body: Hmmm...I have seen this font used in the &#39;Virgin Megastore&#39; logo,
    but I think they have changed it since then, but the font might be very condensed
    in its regular form.  I will try to find a picture of it.

  body: I think the one in the &#34;Johnny English&#34; poster is FB Agency, but the
    one in the lone star spice site is similar, but a different one; the &#34;S&#34;
    looks different.
