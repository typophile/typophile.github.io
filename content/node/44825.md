  a few months and am trying to create a logo for it.  It is a party planning and
  event design magazine.  I'm including a mock-up below.  I wanted to create an elegant
  look that reflected class, however, I wanted it to stand out in the midst of the
  many magazines that are already on the news shelves.  Any font ideas?\r\n\r\nTwo
  questions... what do you think of the logo? I know that \"St. Louis\" looks too
  small and poorly placed.   And what do you think of the name RSVPerfect?  Do you
  think that the general public will understand it or is it too abstract?\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback would be GREATLY appreciated.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/magazine_5097.jpg]"

    Why not just RSVP St Louis?  I worked in the wedding industry for 12 years, and
    I have no idea what R.S.V.Perfect means, abstract or not. \"r\xE9pondez s'il vous
    pla\xEEt ... erfect\"? Huh? I'm just being honest, sorry if it sounds harsh. \r\n\r\nTo
    my eye, the logotype is just a headline made up of three totally unrelated parts.
    Have you worked out the logotype by itself, using black on white only? I'd love
    to see some of those sketches. I think you could find a really lovely typeface
    to work with, but the name makes it hard to picture with this combination of all
    uppercase, a lowercase orphan, and an italic hat. Are you open to dropping the
    \"perfect\"?"

  body: "Thanks so much for your feedback.  I TRULY appreciate it!  The person that
    came up with the name was a brand specialist, apparently he came up with John
    Deer identity and slogan.  He was in the branding business for a long time and
    I was excited to hire him.  Unfortunately, RSVPerfect was the best name that he
    came up with.  For copyright purposes, we thought the \"erfect\" was, clever...
    but I can definitely see your point.  I really like RSVP St. Louis, but unfortunately,
    there is another company here that has the RSVP name and they send out coupon
    postcards from various businesses.  I guess their idea is that you are suppose
    to \"respond\" to the promotional postcards.\r\n\r\nThe logo was originally designed
    by a graphic artist who claimed that she was a font guru.  I am attaching her
    original design.  I wasn't crazy about it, but I had so much going on during the
    time when we finalized the logo, I just wanted to move on.\r\n\r\nSo, now I am
    resurrecting everything and ready to go to print, but I realized that I am struggling
    with the logo... so I am tweeking and playing with what she had done.  So I have
    no sketches.  Do you think I should go back to the drawing board?  What do you
    think of her original design?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rsvperfectlogo_3540.jpg]"

  body: "First off I would slim down the leg of the R and bring the double line to
    the end of the stroke. As it is it sort of resembles an errant Versal. Also you
    need to equalize the weights of the heavy strokes, the S and the V look a bit
    light... might be my screen. The \"er\" and \"ct\" are a bit loose compared to
    the \"rfec.\" Maybe the diamonds could be a tad larger? \r\n\r\nDoes that help?\r\nMichael"

    \ Is there anyone else who would recommend?  Or, do you know Rob's contact info?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
