  body: "That's a tricky one, because almost any typical text face will look too formal
    relative to your titles. I'd go for a \u2018soft\u2019 sans serif such as <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino-sans/\">Palatino
    Sans</a> or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/cronos/\">Cronos</a>.\r\n\r\nGetting
    the size and weight relationship between the titles and text will be critical
    to making this look good."

  body: "I'm thinking something slightly rounded\u2026 Gotham Rounded? Or Calibri
    maybe? \r\nBut I agree with John that it's difficult to not get too stiff and
    formal in this case.\r\nYou might want to look through this list over at FontShop:
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/soft_rounded_sans/\">Soft Rounded
    Sans</a>\r\n\r\nEdit: It just occurred to me that a serif might work quite nicely
    if it's soft/friendly enough to match the script, but not chiro/calligraphic enough
    to conflict with it. \r\nI'd definitely look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_tisa/\">FF
    Tisa</a>. Or possibly <a href=\"http://www.typejockeys.com/fonts/Premiera\">Premi\xE9ra</a>. "
