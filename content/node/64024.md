  body: "I have been hunting with various searches through my [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Guide]], but there are only three key letters (a, e and y) and two Sample letters
    C , G that I can look for, since this sample repeats so many of the same letters.
    Unfortunately, the a, and e are either a bit ambiguous (a), or too common (e)
    to be very helpful. I think the 'y' is the most familiar-feeling, but I have not
    been able to locate it. If you had ANY other letters from the Key letters (b,
    g, E, J, K, M, R, U, W) it could narrow the search significantly.\r\n\r\n- Mike
