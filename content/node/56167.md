  logo done for a independent toy store.  Done by a college student?\r\n\r\nI was
  thinking $200 - $500\r\n\r\nThanks."

    an hour or two on this then the price is probably good for them. \r\n\r\nIf you
    pay the student this and mark up by 200% then the price is good for you.\r\n\r\nIf
    the toy shop owner is happy with the logo then it\u2019s a good price for them.

  body: "Is the logo a means to an end, or does the client see the bigger picture
    and in addition are undertaking a (re)launch to increase their profile in the
    marketplace. Are you getting involved with how the logo is going to be used on
    signage, marketing, advertising and web - if not why not, as these will be factors
    that you take into account when you design the logo?\r\n\r\nSorry i've got my
    dogmatic head on, but a key thing for todays young designers to understand, is
    the need to provide the client with a return on investment. If they spend $100
    or $1million on your services how much money is your expertise going to generate
    for them.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    don't you design this logo for us.  It could lead to other stuff, so I think I'll
    low ball.\r\n\r\nJust getting a feeling for a good going rate for something professional."

    right? No need to be professional.
