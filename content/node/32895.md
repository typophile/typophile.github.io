body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've been trying unsuccessfully to ID the attached logo type,
  so I'm turning to the experts. It doesn't appear to be; Interstate, Arial Narrow,
  Arial Condensed, Helvetica Neue Cond., nor Franklin Gothic Cond. It's a challenge
  due to the limited characters. Could it be custom? And if so would you please recommend
  what fonts would work nicely with the logotype? I will be creating in-house instruction
  manuals, not exciting but I'd like them to be the best they can be.\r\n\r\nThank
  you, your expertise is truly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKirsten"
