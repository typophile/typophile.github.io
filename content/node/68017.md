body: "Good evening all.\r\n\r\nSo I know henna is a medium, not a style, but I'm
  wondering if anyone can help recommend an ornamental font (not lettering, but that
  might be interesting too) that evokes the traditional style of arab and/or asian
  body art. It needn't necessarily be authentic, just evokative. \r\n\r\nSo far I've
  come up with Altemus Arabesques;\r\n\r\nhttp://mehndi-patterns.com\r\n\r\nwhich
  I think is interesting. Anybody else had fun/been inspired by this kind of work?\r\n\r\nTa,\r\nAnthony"

  body: I'm confused. So you're looking for ornamental 'designs' right? Because if
    that's the case, I can scan some and let you have them.
