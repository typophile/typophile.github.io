  'Kew' is obviously customised, and the 'K' seems customised, too. However, the rest
  appears to be unmodified and of the same font.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nmax\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KewGardens_4722.jpg]"

    body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\nYes, that is what I thought, but the 'w', for example, seems
      to have rounded serifs, whereas Perpetua has serifs with hard edges.\r\n\r\nIs
      there a variation of Perpetua with rounded serifs?"

  body: That isn't Perpetua - the T doesn't match. It looks familiar - more like a
    Baskerville but for that 'w'.

  body: Yes, that T is the only problem. Looks like they just sliced off the top.

  body: It's subtle but the serifs don't QUITE match on any of the characters - those
    on the sample are slightly more square, less angled than Perpetua.

    body: Thanks for your replies. I am using Perpetua now, as this seems to be the
      closest.
