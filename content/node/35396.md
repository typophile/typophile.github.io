  Age</a>.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the kangaroo graphic... I really don't like the new
  type. The old type - a classic and memorable identity - had real <em>strength.</em>
  The new one looks lettered by a 12 year old. Examine that 'N'! <em>Mon dieu,</em>
  that 'S'! It looks, at best, like type from a toilet roll pack.\r\n\r\nAnother unnecessary
  and backward provincial identity hack job! (IMNSHO as ex-Australian designer)\r\n"

  body: I agree. I wouldn't have chosen the old one, but the new face is pretty bad.
    I don't think steel grey is a particularly uplifting colour, either.

    and it still looks good.
