body: Until just moments ago, I discovered I've only known Cassandre's Peignot as
  'Penguin'. The first and last time I used it was 1997... I think this is because
  of a Corel version of the face? I'm interested in more details about the 're-master'
  and am finding it rather irritating that all Google roads to 'penguin + typography'
  lead to Jan Tschichold... How did 'penguin' get bundled and distributed, who's properly
  responsible for it, and where have you seen it used awkwardly?

    to tell where it <em>wasn\u2019t</em> used awkwardly! ;-)"
