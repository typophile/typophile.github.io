  to Palace Script Semibold, but it's still not the right weight.  Any suggestions?
  \ I've tried English, Kuentsler, Bickham, Shelly and Berthold with no match.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScriptFont_6533.jpg]"

    based on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/commercial-script/|Commercial Script]].
    The sign painter seems to have thickened up the hairlines either for better legibility,
    or just because it was too hard to paint hairlines. \r\n\r\n"
