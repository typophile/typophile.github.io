  <BR> <BR>BTW, I am refering to the print version - not the web version. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: 'They&#39;ve been using Officina for a while, but now only for really large
    settings on the cover, so you must mean the new face for headings: it&#39;s a
    custom version of FF Zine &#40;Spiekermann was involved in the recent redesign&#41;.
    There are some things I love about Zine, but to me it seems to lack some polish.
    <BR> <BR>As for the body text, I think it didn&#39;t change with the recent redesign,
    but I forget what it is. I find it a bit mannered. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I&#39;ve red the Economist for quite a while. The text face is different in
    the redesign. Erik lurks on this forum, he&#39;s even posted a few messages awhile
    back. He is the one to answer this.

  body: 'The old text face was simply called <i>Economist</i> or <i>Economist 101</i>
    and was designed, I believe, by Briem. You can see a sample here <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=243431"
    target="_blank">http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=243431</a> <BR>or
    in the Precision Type Reference Guide &#40;5.0&#41; if you have that at your disposal.
    The redesigned face is called <i>EcoType</i>; it&#39;s clearly a derivative of
    <i>Economist</i>, but is a little lighter and slightly more condensed in comparison.
    <BR> <BR>But James is right: Erik is the source. <BR> <BR>Jon'
