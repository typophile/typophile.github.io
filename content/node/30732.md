    courses at NSCAD or what all is involved in the design program?

    body: "and yes, there are typography courses at NSCAD University.\r\n\r\nregular
      and advanced, with the option for indipendant.\r\n\r\nhowever, the core of the
      design program is in semiotics and rhetoric.\r\n\r\nin the case of masters you
      simply choose what its going to be about.\r\n\r\nand i hapen to be a type freak."

    it was a lost cause, and accepted the grad school offer instead.\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n(Making
    the possibly unwarranted assumption that he's at least as left wing as the average
    Democratic candidate. But until recently, all the major Canadian political parties
    were to the left of the Democrats, so it seems like a reasonable guess.)"

    ya around here next semester then. There is a few of us type freaks and unfortunately
    there isn't many students who are excited about type so it'll be cool to have
    one around.\r\n\r\nCheers, see ya in the Fall,\r\n\r\nSam"
