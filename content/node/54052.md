body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI've designed and developed elien in Processing. Its glyphs are
  generated by metaballs. A varying number of balls random sizes is overlain on a
  letter skeleton. The interactive application generating elien allows you to input
  text and alter different parameters \u2013 scale, spacing, density, contrast, levels
  and dissolve. This approach yields unlimited variations of styles and weights. You\r\nmay
  export the generated graphics in PDF Format.\r\n\r\nA demo version is available
  here:\r\n<a href=\"http://elien.tatssachen.de/launch\">http://elien.tatssachen.de/launch</a>\r\n\r\nMore
  infos about how elien works can be found here:\r\n<a href=\"http://elien.tatssachen.de\">http://elien.tatssachen.de</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is quite nice (including the great web interface).\r\nI do keep reading
    \"meatballs\" however.  :-)\r\n\r\nAlthough this is already quite accomplished\r\n(PDF
    export too?!) I do have two suggestions:\r\n1) Allow the customization of the
    skeletons. For one thing this would lead to support of non-Latin scripts.\r\n2)
    Have a mode where all the letters in a string can be connected, with the same
    style of rendering; either by having a simple line going through the text, or
    maybe something more complex, like some letters with the tops connected and others
    with the bottoms. I think that bring the \"circuit\" look full circle, and allow
    for some wonderful texture generation (like those DNA \"imprints\" or something).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
