    \"SPENCER\" but if all you need it for is to recreate the logo (no further text
    using that font), there's a pdf on the site with a nice raster image that could
    easily be enlarged, captured, and vectorized.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.spencertech.com/images/stories/spentech-pon.pdf]]\r\n\r\n

  body: 'Thank you both! I need the actual font because they want me to make variations
    on their logo. So long as I''m close enough I doubt anyone will notice. I''m sad
    that I''ll be working with an effed up Verdana but I appreciate knowing. It''s
    exactly 125%. '
