body: "Hello guys \r\n\r\nWould you be so kind, and have a look into that font collection
  please, and help me figure out how to get it to work?\r\n\r\nI bought tyepface call;
  \"summit\", from  http://lisidesign.com/font/summit\r\n\r\n\"Summit contains 10
  styles available in 5 weights. The styles One, Two and Three for both Solid and
  Inline versions\r\n(as seen above) are designed to be used in conjunction with one
  another. This layering system offers an incredible\r\narray of combinations and
  effects.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason the 5 weights display just fine, but their respective
  styles won't list. Only fraction of it. \r\nI did talk to the author, and I was
  informed that he is aware of the issue happening to PC users. But yet to\r\nfind
  way to fix it. \r\n\r\nHere is the font in question:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/f9ezlc9ivb3zq7c/Summit.zip\r\n\r\nCould
  you please tell me what is wrong with it, and is there any way to fix it? I bought
  it for specific project, and the idea\r\nis to use various styles of mix and match
  for building number, metal boxed up letters. But I can't move on, not being able\r\nto
  use it. \r\n\r\nI will sincerely appreciate your expertise. \r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nSeba\r\n"

  body: "Well, the reason it won't work is because the styles aren't named in a way
    which adheres to window's 4-styles-per-family rule. This could be fixed using
    FontLab or FontForge provided you understand proper font-naming conventions.\r\n\r\nThe
    license is a bit vague on whether modification is allowed, but my reading is that
    fixing the name table would be allowed. On the other hand, the license does explicitly
    prohibit redistribution of the font so I'd strongly recommend that you remove
    this file from dropbox.com.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    body: "Dear Andr\xE9\r\n\r\nNote taken. Will remove the file shortly.\r\nI don't
      have any font editing tools. Would it be possible for you to help to change
      that to make them work?\r\nIf that's not too much work of course. \r\nI really
      wouldn't want to buy a software I never use, just for that. And I don't know
      how soon the author can do that for me. \r\nI would really appreciate your help.
      \r\nBut I too will understand if you don't want to be bothered. I can always
      try to redraw that stuff off hand, in AI. and make my composite sample using
      vectors. \r\n\r\ncheers \r\n\r\nSeba\r\n"
