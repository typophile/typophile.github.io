  body: It looks like some of the fonts created with [[http://fontstruct.com/|FontStruct]]
    and you will probably find something similar if not exact there. You could always
    create your own variation if not.

  body: "It looks like a mash-up, incorporating the E and S from Revue (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/revue/revue/glyphs.html),
    and various mismatched letterforms from God-knows-where.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I\u2019m
    reasonably certain it didn\u2019t ship with Vista or Windows 7\u2014although the
    last H-P I bought did come with a number of Ray Larabie\u2019s and my freeware
    fonts pre-installed. I presume that the check is still in the mail\u2026"

  body: "@seansk8er &ndash; You draw on your mind until you've drawn your mind away.\r\n\r\nLongwinded
    way: You draw glyphs which you then combine into a typeface. You then work some
    arcane magic on the typeface until you have a working font, ready to install.
    For, as it was once said, \"A font is a typeface with a hard hat on.\" And, yes,
    I'm leaving out some six cuckoozillion steps."
