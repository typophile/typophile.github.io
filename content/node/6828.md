  alt="Anglo-black from Plain Printing Types&#44; p.312"> <BR> <BR>De Vinne&#39;s
  commentary: <BR> <BR>The designer of the Anglo-black has given a good imitation
  of an incised letter, in the gothic style, cut in stone by different blows of the
  chisel. It has no beauty of form to recommend it, but is an appropriate letter for
  the representation of inscriptions on tombstones. <BR> <BR>Do typophiles know of
  any revival of this face? Is it really as charmless as De Vinne makes it sound?'

  body: 'De Vinne was sort of a wet blanket to some extent&#42;, although &#34;Plain
    Printing Types&#34; and parts of his other two books are great. One font he shows
    that I do think deserves a revival is on page 201: the #19 of Phelps, Dalton &amp;
    Co. - check out them hybrid numerals. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which doesn&#39;t mean I
    disagree with him about this particular font... <BR> <BR>hhp'
