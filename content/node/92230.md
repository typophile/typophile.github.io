body: "I'm looking to get 'up-to-date' regarding sans-serif typefaces and was wondering
  if anyone could give me a general overview of what's happening at the moment, particularly
  with geometric/neo grotesque styles.\r\n\r\nI have got to a point where I am familiar
  with the majority of 'classic' faces (i.e. Helvetica, Univers, Futura etc). I now
  want to start using something a bit more contemporary. The problem is I don't really
  know where to start - I am aware of most of the major foundries and have looked
  at a few faces I've heard of such as FF Bau, Calibre, Graphik, and Brown, but am
  concerned I may be missing something very obvious, or should be considering some
  other options.\r\n\r\nIs there anything that's been released in the past few years
  that really stands out? Can anyone provide a semi-decent list of faces I should
  be looking at?"

  body: "I would suggest you look at publications/ads/websites that you like the typography
    of (or which give you ideas to pursue), and try and identify the fonts used. Then
    eliminate the oldies and retreads.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could investigate
    the rationales behind a variety of new faces, and see if any of the theory strikes
    a chord with your own design interests.\r\n\r\nTo get a feel for who is designing
    what, start with MyFonts and FontShop, which distribute the majority of contemporary
    designers/foundries, and add the self-distributors to \uFB01ll out the picture:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/92109\r\n\r\nGet

  body: Thanks for the comments. I do have some examples I'd be interested in ID'ing,
    so will post in the ID forum. Funny you say that oldnick, a lot of what I read
    about new Sans Serifs does seem to revolve around how the lower case a has been
    handled. I'm fairly worried I'll spend hundreds of dollars on a family that will
    look dated in a years time...
