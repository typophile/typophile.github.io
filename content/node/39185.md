  anything.  Nevertheless, I've found it very enriching to read your critiques and
  watch the creative process at work.\r\n\r\nMy brother and I are in the process of
  starting up a graphic design / fine art company, and I'm trying to finalize a logo.
  \ We're planning to do a wide variety of things, from basic design work (identity,
  signage, etc.) to music-oriented work (gig posters, album art) to more traditional
  artwork (painting, murals).  We both tend toward \"quirkiness\" in our work, I guess
  you could say.\r\n\r\nI've sketched out a bunch of ideas, and this seemed to be
  the strongest to me.  I'm reluctant to explain myself too much, because I really
  want to see what comes across to you through this logo.  Needless to say, it's not
  strict typography.  Any suggestions are much appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reinvention_design_idea_3456.png]"

  body: "I like your logo, it rocks.\r\nThe socket of the lightbulb is screwed into
    the word design like you are saying \"screw design\". Reinvention is exactly that,
    and spelling it out in your font of choice is perfect for the concept. I get the
    idea!?\r\nThin strokes, like those in the middle of the lightbulb, will be hard
    to print in smaller versions and then the lightbulb might look like a sun. You
    could do something to the \"DESIGN\" as it do not look as good as the \"REINVENTION\",
    maybe try to make it more related by removing the serifs on the \"I\" (but that
    might go against the concept?).\r\nGreat colors!\r\nLove it! Well done and best
    of luck!\r\n"
