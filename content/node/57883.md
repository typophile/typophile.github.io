  for books with non-standard diacritics (outside of the open-type pro capabilities),
  can you recommend any text fonts that can support extended diacritics such as under
  dots for Latin characters for both consonants and vowels?\r\n\r\nI found that Adobe
  Garamond Premier Pro offers some under dot characters for vowels but not consonants.
  I would definitely need a font that offers both. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n"

    is certainly capable of it, the question is whether the fonts support it (which
    of course is the question you're asking, I just wanted to clear up that technical
    detail)"

    is needed for transliterating the guttaral n in Devanagari. This is no drawback,
    though, because a general-purpose font can never cover all the many diacritics
    used by all scholars in the world."

  body: "I think what Maya is looking for -- at least at this point -- are fonts that
    have characters with underdots, not a discussion on the various ways they can
    be created.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the Times Roman Simon showed has this capability.
    I didn't know of any fonts where all the Latin characters have been covered; looks
    like the new Times does this. Is the feature written so it works with InDesign,
    or just MS Word? \r\n\r\nBut the comment on needing consonants with underdots
    raises another issue, Maya. Are you looking for a mechanism which will let you
    put a dot under any character? If so, that would usually be a function of the
    layout program -- usually termed a floating accent. To the best of my knowledge,
    neither InDesign nor Quark have this. TeX does, but the \"floating accent\" primitive
    is relatively simple, and positioning sometimes suffers. With TeX, you can write
    a more sophisticated routine for individual positioning, but I doubt that's going
    to happen with InDesign or Quark."
