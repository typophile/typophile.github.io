  body: Unfortuately I can&#39;t find an exact match, particularly for that ampersand,
    which is more in the style of a Caslon italic. Since the album was released in
    1996, it&#39;s possible the art wasn&#39;t done on a computer, and thus this particular
    cut may not be available digitally. But <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caslon-540/">Caslon
    540</a> is a very good match &#40;though not exact&#41; for the rest of the sample.
