<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>In my neverending quest to complete just one set of glyphs into a sellable font, I become overwhelmed when I see the pros. Usually with scores of fully equipped font families under their belt. Foreign chars, ligatures, and all. How does one man (or woman) do so much in a lifetime? Especially when it takes me so damn long to finish a measly ONE. Am I missing some big secret here?
I think my main problem is I don't know when to stop. This question comes from looking at existing fonts. For example, the > was virtually identical to the mirrored <, but a copy + paste-on-top reveals minor differences. Is this due to casual carelessness, or just the opposite? Since I've attributed it to being intentional, I now draw as if my glyphs have to be mathematically point perfect in order for it to be supported by the foundries. How good is good enough?
Oh yeah, and I haven't even started hinting.

<div class=commentbody>Point perfect is how it should be. You are a novice but always do you maximum at all times and go slowly.
Many type designers subcontract out font production work or even design and it still takes years and years! [Erik Spikermann and Mike Abbink] have. So no worries. Just do you very best.

Time at it, is a big part. I assume you are attempting this digitally?
If this is the first "font" you've designed, maybe You are not "being a good client." I find it's easier when I have a who, telling me what, why, where and especially when. In the absence of an actual client, I make one up if I have to to perform the vital function of worrying needfully.
Then, if you think about the word font literally you can be a better client by only looking at and judging the font used for one precise intended purpose. Practically speaking this makes the definition of <em>"mathematically point perfect"</em> apply only to a single use of the digital outline, and not all possible uses.
This focusing of your eyes on an actual target, hopefully frees you to use the tools, hit the mark, and stop right there, as in — that looks good, and it works, next glyph, or...<strong>next font</strong>.
Cheers!

<div class=commentbody>koleslaw, to these fine comments I will add one that may be obvious, but it's something I learned from my own mistakes... Don't set out to create an entire character set without testing a <a href=http://www.fonts.com/AboutFonts/Glossary/_glossary_K.htm><strong>key word</strong></a> first... If you are trying to submit your design to a foundry, that may be all you need for starters.</div>

<div class=commentbody>David,
Thanks for the sage advice from a master! I have been working on 12 different type families for the past 3 years and have yet to move any of them out the door. With every thing I do, I learn something and then revisit the whole mess to apply it. My growth as a critic of my work easily outpaces my ability to complete it.

<div class=commentbody>I think Ricardo's comment is most crucial; save literally months of plodding by resolving problems with the test characters. Measure twice, cut once. I didn't actually do that with my last release, but I did start it while an intern, and I learned what Chris is now learning. Now, when I test out designs, I never go beyond keyword stage until I've made up my mind and solved basic design issues, and anymore, I don't even start unless there is a brief or specific intended use.
Not sure what your process or tools are, but the enormous character sets in Latin typefaces are composites, and the accented characters can be assembled in a very short time when the parts are finalized. That step should not drag on, and niether should kerning, if spacing is resolved and you use time-savers like kerning classes.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's good to start on either techno or casual/grunge/distressed fonts, all quite legitimate genres.
For the first, "point perfect" is relatively easy, and for the second lot, it doesn't really matter.
And you don't need a massive character set.
Chris, it's software. If a font does well, issue an upgrade later if you think the "features" are more buggy than charming. You'd be in good company, as many type designers have produced "version 2" of some very popular and well-respected fonts.

<div class=commentbody>Wow, didn't expect such a massive response. Thanks for the wise words everyone! It's definitely motivation to keep me going. I'll start judging with my eyes more and worrying less about points aligning and so on (since it's a casual handwriting font) I'll post it in the critique section soon. </div>

<div class=commentbody>koleslaw,
Its all about stamina isn't it! Your first font is a massive undertaking and then slowly it changes. Your point of view will change. Why work on one font when you can work on a design matrix that allows you to work on 4 or 8 or 12 or 16 or 32. As you work in this medium, your stamina and precision will increase. If you can't keep 8 or 10 or 32 fonts in your head at one time you will have a hard time of it. Crawl before you walk. Eventually you will run! (Or maybe not!)
