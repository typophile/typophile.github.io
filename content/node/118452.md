  on feedback on a new typeface I\u2019m working on; it\u2019s based on my current
  logotype.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a wide-set display didone. My design uses hairline serifs,
  and then flared shapes that flow from the hairline to construct letterforms that
  usually are defined by serifs, where a hairline serif would be too ill-defined.\r\n\r\nHere
  is my newly modified logotype that I am expanding into a typeface, I added a curl
  to the /R/ leg, as well as tracked out my first name.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4061.png]\r\n\r\nLooking
  for ideas, because I\u2019ve been told that having both hairline and bracket serif
  styles makes the design seem disconnected, but I feel that the curved forms of the
  flaring connects with design of the curved letters, and just hairline serifs would
  affect legibility a lot, especially since the weight of the face is very heavy.
  The more I can have it match my logo, without \u201Cforcing it\u201D, the better.\r\n\r\nThe
  usage I have in mind is large display usage and very short headlines."

  body: "So far so good. A few comments:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The /S/ could be more contrasting
    in its transitions. I would prolong the hairline thickness closer to the spine.</li>\r\n<li>The
    junction to the upper serif in /S/ is a bit too low/steep.</li>\r\n<li>The /!/
    lacks of contrast. Try tapering the lower end of the drop.</li>\r\n<li>The terminal
    of /R/ is too thin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nKeep it up!"
