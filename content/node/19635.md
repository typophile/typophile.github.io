  of fontlab. Once the font is created I end up with a problem regarding my quotation
  marks. They work well enough in adobe illustrator, indesign and photoshop but they
  do not seem to work in apple keynote or powerpoint. This makes me think that the
  problem is with the screen font. Does anybody have any clue how to remedy this situation? '
