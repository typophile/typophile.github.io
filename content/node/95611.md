  \u2013 10/23/08)\r\nMEMORANDUM TO COUNSEL\r\nFROM: Clerk of the Court\r\nSUBJECT:
  Revised Supreme Court Rules\r\nThe Supreme Court recently revised its Rules of the
  Court, effective October 1, 2007. The revised Rules contain changes that are important
  to you and parties filing documents in this Court. This memorandum is designed to
  outline some of the most important changes.\r\nWORD COUNT AND FONT\r\nRevised Rule
  33.1 requires word, rather than page, limits. The typeface must be in a<strong?
  Century family (e.g., Century Expanded, New Century Schoolbook, or Century Schoolbook)</strong>
  12-point. The typeface of footnotes must be in 10-point type. Rule 33.1(h) provides
  that documents prepared under Rule 33.1 must be accompanied by a certificate signed
  by the attorney or preparer of the document stating that the brief complies with
  the word limitations. The certificate should not be bound with the brief. Preparers
  may rely on the word count of the word-processing system used to prepare the document.
  Footnotes must be included in the word count. The certificate must state the number
  of words in a document.\r\nThe count certification may be worded as follows:\r\n\u201CAs
  required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains _____
  words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court Rule
  33.1(d).\r\n\u201CI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true
  and correct.\r\n\u201CExecuted on _____________, 20___.\r\n_____________________
  (Signature)\u201D\r\n\r\nWho owns the most extensive collection of Supreme Court
  approved typefaces? Also relevant to many other previous threads.\r\n\r\nSo: I cannot
  even use my own fonts to prepare an amicus curiae brief before the Supreme Court;
  OR\r\n\r\na complete legitimate case can be thrown out on appeal for not having
  prepared the original documents in a Monotype-owned typeface?"
