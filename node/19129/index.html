  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear typographers &c.,

I'm working on my first book design, which is a dissertation on a subject in (the history of) military science. Although I've read my Bringhurst and these forums, I'm having trouble deciding on a typeface. The writer himself has only one demand: that the text be legible, which for him implies rather heavy/dark. 

His writing style is somewhat old-fashioned; perhaps, a little dry too. Should I support the character of the text with a classy but 'boring' Garamond or Minion? Or would it be better, instead, to liven up the text with something more modern, exciting and quirky, like Quadraat or Dolly?

So, do you have any suggestions for a serif typeface that, in order of importance
(1) is suitable for setting long text (the book will be about 400 pages in size)
(2) has nice small caps for headings and nice italics (which are used quite extensively)
(3) has something of a 'military' feel to it (this should, of course, not be overdone)

Thank you in advance for any help you can give me.</div>

George, you mean <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1004/conrad-family.html">Linotype Conrad</a>? Too irregular for body text, in my humble opinion. 

The period covered is, to say the least, not too specific: from 1469 BC up to the Cold War.</div>

Clifford is great, but not OT. Some OT ideas:
Bulmer, Kepler, Arnhem, Storm's Baskeville Ten and his Walbaum Text. 

Or, if you're stiil thinking of Quadraat, have a look at Fresco.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I'll be using InDesign. What exactly are the pros of using OpenType fonts, considering I've already set up separate character styles for small caps and the like, which can easily be switched back and forth between OpenType and Postscript variants?

Bulmer I find not adventurous enough. Kepler I like, but not so much its commas and quotation marks. Whitman and Walbaum are interesting options. 

Pataline, <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview">Dolly</a> (not OpenType, by the way) is one of the fonts I'm considering. I really like its lively character, which indeed might work to make the dry text a bit more exciting. On the other hand, don't you think Dolly (<a href="http://www.underware.nl/download/dolly/pdf/Dolly.pdf">example pdf</a>) is too happy and friendly a typeface for serious subject matter such as war and its history?

I've also come across Slimbach's Warnock. Would that be acceptable, keeping in mind the subject of the book? I guess Cronos is a good sans companion? </div>

This made me think immediately of the work of Smeijers,
like Renard or Arnhem. If you're going for darkish type
it's much better to choose from designs intended as such,
as opposed to a generally-after-the-thought demi weight
of something-or-other.

Well, it depends on the fonts, but usually more extensive ligatures, kerning between the small caps and the roman, the superiors, fractions and the like. Switching to "expert sets" for some characters often breaks spellchecking. Better language support means you're less likely to be in trouble when you discover the Czech name in your English text.

I set a book in Warnock, because I needed the Greek, and I was very pleased with it.</div>
