  for all understand the file nomenclature use for fonts?\r\n\r\nFor example this
  one\r\n\r\nCorinthianT\r\n\r\nIs the T stands for \"Text\" or it stands for one
  of the many publisher or type foundry?\r\n\r\nPlease advise\r\n\r\nThank you very

  body: "It would be nice if there were a standard, but I don't think that is the
    case. Sometimes 'T' would indicate Tabular numerals that line up. Sometimes it
    could be the weight, like Text, Bold, Ultra. It can often be the foundry designation,
    like ScriptMT, which originates with Monotype (MT), or 'BT', which is usually
    Bitstream. 'LT' is usually Linotype.\r\n\r\nI think the purpose is to identify
    font files with a unique name, especially for families, so that the software picks
    the right file in PS1 fonts that use two files to create the entire font data.
    That's my understanding, at least.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    future could help sort out this things.\r\n\r\nI knew about the LT MT and so on
    but the T seems to call out for Text but I am not sure. I have find it in many
    font family, but can figure out what is the purpose of it.\r\n\r\nThank you Mike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCristian"

  body: "Thank you all for your input.\r\n\r\nI will check the links and also to respond
    to Thomas post, yes I noticed that many URW typefaces use that sort of nomenclature.
    So I guess when I see that sort of naming system I should assume it is a URW typeface.\r\n\r\nAgain
    thank you all very much for time.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nCristian"
