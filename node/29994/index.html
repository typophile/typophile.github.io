  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Please help me decide between these three versions. Any criticism would be greatly appreciated also.</p>
<p>Version #1 is the initial concept, with the wordmark letter shapes intending to resemble carabiners. The triangular shape proved a bit too awkward to work with however, and thus version #2 was conceived. To add a little humanist aesthetic and visual interest, the horizontals of the wordmark were slightly thinned for version #3.</p>
<p>I am worried that the initial concept might have been lost throughout this process of refinement (was it even obvious in the first place?).</p>
<p>MEC stands for Mountain Equipment Co-op. For those not in the know, they&rsquo;re Canada&rsquo;s largest outdoor gear retailer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer version 2, but I find the mountain icon a little ambiguous it could be mistaken for a hat, maybe having the peaks at different heights could help, the radius of the corners seems a bit too much, you could introduce the carabiner theme by using an open carabiner as a lowercase e, you needn&rsquo;t change the shape of the sides of the character. I also feel that with the counters being so closed your kerning could almost be equal spaces.

<p>I think the problem in the mountains is the size of the curve in the middle—it disappears at small sizes and the concept is dead on, but at larger sizes there&rsquo;s something going on between the two peaks and that big negative space that doesn&rsquo;t work so well.</p>

<p>I have incorporated <strong>timd</strong>&rsquo;s suggestion regarding the E and you can see it in action below, next to a rendering of the original. What do you guys think? I&rsquo;ve also made the kerning equal between the letters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also tried a few quick comps with the peaks at different heights, but that didn&rsquo;t go too well. I&rsquo;ve also played around with the curves a bit, with similarly discouraging results.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what else I can do about the peaks. I would like to keep them symmetrical, since they form the negative shape of the letter M (with stems slightly apart). At the same time, I feel the symmetry does look a bit static and boring and not exactly representative of the excitement of outdoor activities. <img src="/images/old-images/mec-typophile004_5934.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Good point about the endings. I had tried the rounded endings as well during my earlier process, but I wasn&rsquo;t entirely happy with the results. They made the counters too tight for my liking and made the letters a tad too predictable. I think I like the rectangular endings more as they create a little bit of variation between the rounded corners and the sharp edges.</p>
<p>I would be happy to hear other opinions on <strong>cannon46</strong>&rsquo;s suggestion, however.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you all for the feedback so far, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Based on the comments received, it seemed to be a tie between 2.2 and 2.3. I really like 2.2 because it does indeed resemble a climbing carabiner more than anything else, but in the end I think I&rsquo;ll end up going with 2.3 for legibility&rsquo;s sake (I&rsquo;ve had a comment from a non-designer that the &lsquo;e&rsquo; in 2.2 doesn&rsquo;t look like an &lsquo;e&rsquo; because of its open counter).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done some more renditions based on the comments received. 2.3.1 is a variation of 2.3 with rounded corners. I took <strong>timd</strong>&rsquo;s suggestion into account and rounded just the corners rather than the whole terminals. 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 are based on <strong>cannon46</strong>&rsquo;s suggestion to compress the text (I did keep the old shapes however).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether I find any of these new variations more effective than the old ones, but I&rsquo;m always eager to hear what other people think.</p>
