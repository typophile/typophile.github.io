  the forum, I've got a small branding job on so am looking for pro' opinion.\r\n\r\nThe
  company is due to start the manufacture of bespoke paper goods such as greetings
  cards and the like. The client wanted to give an air of an old style, well established
  company to the identity so we developed the typography and whittled it down to what
  you see below (Livory Bold). I felt the character of the typeface was strong enough
  to become a logotype in its own right with no supporting mark (obviously unless
  the client changes his mind).\r\n\r\nAfter a little typographic history lesson thrown
  in from me, the general roundness of the characters, open counters on the 'p' and
  likeness to traditional hand-cut type really appealled to him. It's a simple case
  of getting the kerning correct.\r\n\r\nAny positive / negative thoughts would be
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PandB_test_typophile_4749.png]"

  body: Aside from an odd spelling, I think the actual choice of the type works well.
    Perhaps only the ampersand is a bit too heavy and imposing compared to the rest,
    having it in a smaller size (but without losing the weight) would work better
    IMO.

  body: "Very nice choice of typeface. Seems very appealing (and appropriate: It definitely
    has that \"inky\" feel).\r\n\r\n\"ck\" is too loose to my eye (and actually \"ac\"
    seems a little tight, so nudging the \"c\" a bit to the right may be all that's
    needed). Also, my eye keeps being drawn to the gap in the \"k\"... not sure about
    that detail. Dunno, maybe that could be a little narrower or something?"

  body: "<cite>riccard0</cite> is spot on with that one.\r\nI think the client wanted
    the company to sound like a pair of names but is in fact based on the Swedish
    for 'paper & ink'.\r\nI agree that at face value it is a little odd but the logic
    the client presented to me was sound. I was actually quite impressed, I'm used
    to dealing with folks who really don't think about things at all.\r\n\r\n@apankrat\r\n@nina\r\n\r\nThank
    you for the great advice. I've implemented that into the versions you see below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PandB_test_typophile_update1_5007.png]\r\n<cite>'a-c-k'

    too light.

  body: "@riccard0 I totally agree.\r\nJust thought I'd put it out there considering
    it was a serious suggestion.\r\n\r\n@nina\r\nIn hindsight, that 'k' is bothering
    me. Now that I have tightened the leg, wouldn't the next logical step in terms
    of consistency be to match that gap on the upper and lower case 'p'?\r\n\r\nAdditionally
    (this is the web designer in me talking), I'm worried that when scaled to its
    smallest size on screen, the effect will be to merge the stem and leg causing
    the open counter on the 'p' to look out of place if I left it as it is.\r\nIf
    I match the gap on the 'p' and reduce to this size, the open counter will simply
    disappear and undermine the entire typeface choice. Dilemma.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PandB_test_typophile_update_small2_5142.png]\r\n<cite>original
