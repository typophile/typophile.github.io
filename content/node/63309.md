  body: "@all\r\nI didn't read all the reviews of Gutenberg's bible when it was first
    published but I'm sure the font was attacked as a bad knockoff. Some monk somewhere
    probably sued.\r\nAnyway, writing as a web developer, the significance of font
    linking goes beyond cosmetics.\r\nUntil now, web designers have faced a problem
    that's almost impossible for those in the print trades to even imagine: the font
    has been a variable rather than a constant.\r\nI guess the closest analogy would
    be leaving the choice of fonts to a service bureau. \"Come as close to this as
    you can\", would be about all you could say.\r\nIn other words, so many design
    decisions that normally would be based on the metrics of the font have been impossible
    to make because, when you don't know what font is going to be used with any level
    of certainty, you can't make them.\r\nAn intolerable situation for sure. And one
    which, because of the large files sizes involved, could not even be addressed
    until broadband became the norm rather than the exception.\r\nThe very beginings
    of web typography are where we are at now. And it effects everything - layout,
    the need to scroll or not, everything needs to be looked at freshly.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    right now, the uglier it is, the better I like it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRich\r\n"

  body: "Well obviously this will lead to greater \"MySpace-ification\" of the web
    when it comes to pages generated or customized by amateurs, which is nothing new.
    Now the lameness no longer is restricted to themes and imagery, but also to type.
    Prior to this, type on the web was generic, which is arguably better than this
    (at least generic type such as Times and Verdana are legible). But the point is
    that designed pages and sites will be designed and non-designed pages will be
    non-designed. What @font-face does is allow the designed pages to look even better
    and even more geared towards the audience and message. I don't know why typographers
    are so appalled, if anything this *increases* the difference in quality between
    designed and undesigned pages and makes design that much more valuable. \r\nWhining
    about @font-face is like whining about people being able to make hand-lettered
    posters (for a missing dog, or a party promotion) and stick them on poles, walls
    and columns in the offline world; and I've seen many typographers whine about
    that. \r\n\r\nToo many typographers and designers tend to want to educate the
    masses about graphic design, but I think that's just a sign of insecurity, because
    the power of graphic design works whether the audience is aware of it or not.
    The only people that need to know why a certain alternative or approach is better
    than another is your clients. \r\nToo many designers want to \"cure the visual
    disease\", they want to make everything look good, e.g. the entire web, but the
    only thing you have to make look good and make it communicate the right messages
    is your client's graphics. \r\n\r\nBesides, suppose you're designing a social
    website, you can set restrictions and guidelines on what can be styled or customized
    in personal pages (e.g. profile page) kind of like Facebook does (unlike MySpace). "

  body: "@william berkson\r\n<em>\"Also at large sizes, the tracking should be tighter,
    and I suppose browsers don\u2019t do that.\"</em>\r\n\r\nOn their own, browsers
    do what they do, depending upon the font. There is a default behavior.\r\nBeyond
    that, web authors have as much control over tracking as can be gotten in any program
    - at least as far as screen display is concerned. (Not when the web page is printed
    out.)\r\nTracking instructions can be set at the pixel level. Cascading Style
    Sheets (CSS), is the \"language\" that browsers use to control presentation -
    spacing between glyphs being a part of that.\r\nInter-word spacing, too. \r\nBut
    instead of pixel units, I recommend using em units for tracking and kerning in
    CSS, for a variety of reasons. \r\nOne of them is that, within the font, the em
    unit is very finely subdivided (which, as a type designer, you know). On LCD screens,
    one result of this - at least in Windows with Cleartype - is that you can get
    the sub-pixels of the X-axis working for you, too.\r\n\r\nHowever, right now,
    web authors usually don't fuss with typography on this level.\r\nViewed historically,
    there are understandable reasons for this. While browsers have had this capability
    for quite some time, in a world of CRT screens where everything looked crappy
    anyway, it just didn't pay.\r\nThings change. Usually for the better. It takes
    time for new capabilities to sink into people's heads.\r\n\r\nBut then there are
    those who share the philosophy of DanGayle - that somehow lack of precision and
    predictability are virtues.\r\nThey aren't. They were just the consequences of
    web browsers and HTML being a young and very incomplete technology.\r\n(I've run
    into this before. Many, many times.)\r\nI don't believe this attitude will survive
    in the long term.\r\n\r\nciao, rich\r\n\r\n*Occurred to me there's an example
    of exactly the kind of fine adjustment I'm talking about on my web site, <a href=\"http://readableweb.com\">Readable
    Web</a>. I'm using @font-face to bring in the font for the logo type. The font/windows/browser
    decision about spacing between the R and e immediately following, and the W and
    e immediately following that, were too wide. I adjusted it - call it tracking,
    kerning, as you will - using CSS. I haven't checked it on a Mac but in Safari
    on Windows it's OK, too."

  body: "\"lack of precision and predictability are virtues\"\r\n\r\nBuilding with
    flexibility is virtue. This is the first time in human history that flexibility
    has even been an <em>option</em>, let alone a necessity.\r\n\r\nIt's all about
    the end user, and designing with flexibility in mind. Because, like it or not,
    the end user is going to override your finely wrought design somehow. Wrong browser,
    wrong viewport, wrong type size, wrong whatever.\r\n\r\nI build websites precisely
    and predictably knowing that someone is going to not be able to see it the way
    I see it, and that's ok because they have different needs and circumstances than
    me.\r\n\r\nAs to the subject of @font-face, I think it's great. But I will not
