  body: "[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/placard-mt/|Placard]] might be
    pretty close in a digital type for \"STARLIGHTERS\" (I say that because I believe
    this was pre-digital). The script (Marvin Berry) is harder to match, but there
    are a number of fonts in Part 7 of my Script Font ID Guide that are possibly close
    enough. I looked mainly for the M and B, then for a similar 'r' style. Closest
    choices to me were: [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg6.html|Sarah Script]],
    [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg7.html|Swingdancer]], [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg8.html|Snapper
    Script]], and [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg10.html|Nitro DNA]]
