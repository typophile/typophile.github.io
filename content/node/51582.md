  body: "Hi Johnny\r\n\r\nPerhaps you should bring it all together in one general
    theme like: creative.\r\n\r\nThe aperture-idea is \u2013 in my opinion \u2013
    too straight foreward. Too common. \r\nIt is one of the first things you think
    about when thinking about photography. But then again, it is very clear what it
    is about.\r\nBut still I think it is not the right way. Also because you do more
    than just photography.\r\n\r\nNumber 9 and 10 (http://www.johnnycorcoran.ie/logofour.html)
    look nice, but it is not clear what I am looking at.\r\n\r\nI don't like the ideas
    at http://www.johnnycorcoran.ie/logofive.html  \r\n\r\nHope this helps a little.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRaymond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you settle on a logo/masthead that lists the three areas you work in,
    the descriptions should be grammatically parallel, either: \r\n\r\n     Photographer
    / Graphic Designer / Digital Artist \r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n     Photography / Graphic
    Design / Digital Art\r\n"
