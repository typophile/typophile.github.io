body: Hello!  I've been trying to track down a good font for the technical drawings
  I work on.  I came across a document that has exactly what I'm looking for.  See
  attached.  Sorry for the quality.  It was taken from a scanned document and the
  print was quite small.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  I've tried to find
  something myself but have had no luck.  Thanks!
