  body: "Based on _Suzie Wong_ an old metal type. Digitized by various font-makers
    under this name and others. Aliases:\r\nChinese (Brendel); \r\nShantung (Novel),
    \r\nShanghai (Prima, Opti, Mauerkirchner&Grunert).\r\nNo current legitimate source.\r\nDigitization
    apparently based on a font purchased by Dan X. Solo.\r\nSuzie Wong is a common
    version of  faux-Chinese lettering labelled variously as wonton, chopstick, chow
    mein, chop suey, rickshaw, take out, and so forth, which are styled to mimic the
    brush strokes used in Chinese characters The faux Chinese designs originated with
    a font patented (D14150) by Henry H. Thorp on July 31, 1883 with the name Chinese
    Wong.\r\nThey have been criticized as being offensive as expressions of Orientalism
    and racial stereotyping.\r\nThey do not fit the current ethos of political correctness.
    So use it at your own risk.\r\nMore on this issue at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonton_font\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Errors in my previous post. I mentioned several aliases for Suzie Wong. On
    checking I determined that at least some of them are derived from Mandarin not
    Suzie Wong. Mandarin is the current incarnation of Thorp's Chinese [Wong]. Available
    from Elsner+Flake, Linotype, URW +++. Note Mandarin's differences from Suzie Wong,
    such as the cross stroke at the top of the A. Here are the letters in Suzie Wong:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuzieWongInUse_5224.jpg]\r\nand
    in Mandarin:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MandarinInUse_4776.jpg]\r\nDon"
