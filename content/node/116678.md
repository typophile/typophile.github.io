  identifont and have had no luck. I've also perused dafont for about an hour. Any
  help would be super appreciated!\r\n\r\nI realize the words on the left and right
  of \"Growly\" are made up of a simple serif font. It's the word \"Growly\" in the
  middle that i'm needing to identify. \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nKelsey[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Growly_6106.JPG]"

  body: The word 'GROWLY' is in the swash capital form of the simple serif font that
    you seem uninterested in and I'm unable to identify. So they're the same font,
    basically.

  body: "Looks like the swashes and alternates for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/|Bookmania]]\r\n\r\nThe
    lower case text looks to be Bookmania as well, or Bookman of sorts."
