  you? and if so, what font was it? and what price?\r\n\r\nthe most memorable one
  were Gotham (around 300). Spend 15 minutes weighing the pro and con. Eventually
  (2 years later) friends pitch in and bought it for my birthday.\r\n\r\n"

    package (if I remember correctly). I would never personally buy that font, but
    if it was appropriate to a job that was costing over $100,000 in print charges,
    etc., then perhaps a chargeback of that extent would be sensible.\r\n\r\nI'd really
    have to be convinced that the $1000 package would be sufficiently more effective
    than a $200 alternative before making that decision, though."

    Because initially it was released for $1,500, but that was just a humorous promotion;
    it's now a reasonable <a href=http://www.houseind.com/fonts/luxuryfonts>$249</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    have definitely been deterred by the high prices at <a href=http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/>DTL</a>
    and <a href=http://www.teff.nl/index-type.html>TEFF</a>. They definitely have
    some great typefaces, but there really isn't any way I could justify buying a
    single font for the same price (or more) as a <a href=http://vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/>full
    family</a>."

    yes, I really, really want [[http://www.teff.nl/fonts/renard/index.html|Ensched\xE9's
    beautiful, fat Renard]], but \u20AC562 ($765 or \xA3489.85) for a single variant
    is close to ridiculous. You can buy foundry type for that kind of money. I wish
    I too had friends."

  body: "heh :) it's an unspoken rule within circle of designer friends. Every year
    we would group purchase fonts for birthdays and holidays. Every five years it's
    an adobe master package.\r\n It takes out of lots of work on present guessing,
    and the receiver is always happy. \r\n"

  body: "Hi There:\r\n\r\nYes, of course! There are so many excellent typefaces and
    founderies that are currently out of my reach. \r\n\r\nOurType, DTL, Font Bureau
    Studio Library, Teff and probably Typonine.\r\n\r\nBut I always try to cross-shop
    at different foundries to see who has the best quality and the best value for
    the genre/style I\u2019m looking for. So I guess I really don\u2019t have uninformed
    impulsive buys. I\u2019m so tired of buying really cheap fonts that have lousy
    character sets and metrics!\r\n\r\nText faces for books is one category that seems
    to be growing exponentially each year. There is so much choice because there is
    so much competition. So if I have to save for it, it will a long time before I
    buy it.\r\n\r\nSometimes there\u2019s a face with no satisfying analogues. Big
    Caslon Italic is one of those fonts. There\u2019s nothing like it in the world.
    It\u2019s a $100 a style. I\u2019ve bought a few. If it was something else\u2014no
    way!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Value_3976.png]\r\n\r\nThere is
    a recent thread on the University of Reading graduates in which I was planning
    on making a few comments on, but I will make them here. If you thought the concept
    of the \u201Chouse style\u201D died or only applies to oil and canvas then you
    would be wrong. Take a look at much of the output from University of Reading and
    KABK. Variations on themes (for Reading it seams to be the extremely syncopated
    and faceted text faces) and undeclared \u201Chomages\u201D to their typographic
    heros (Veronika Burian and Underware must be annoyed)\r\n\r\nBut its not all bad
    tho... this gives us graphic designers options\u2014options at different price
    points. I use this for instance.\r\n\r\nTake a look at Greta:\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text\r\n\r\nThen
    take a look at Acon:\r\nhttp://www.mysterywesterntheory.com/holger/index.php?/project/acon/\r\n\r\nThey
    just might (hopefully) be at different price points too (Acon, I assume is still
    in development). So if you need a Greta for books Acon maybe for you.\r\n\r\nPrice
    is isn\u2019t the only thing that holds me back from the spur of the moment purchase\u2014it\u2019s
    licensing too:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/51784\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing up
    this topic,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"
