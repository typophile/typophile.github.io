<p>Do you organize different typefaces into folders? Do you type words in that relate to the usefullness of the typeface, or type in random words, etc? Any general advice on setting up a library like this?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Without a specimen, a typeface is essentially an idea. Type for print performs differently in different environments, and it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to know how well it performs, without printed examples. In our digital world, nobody wants to spend money on printed specimens. So to choose a font for a book or magazine, you have to view them onscreen at a large size, and then somehow infer how the fonts will look when printed much smaller on paper. That&rsquo;s an unreasonable leap to ask people to make, when they&rsquo;re going to spend money and commit their project to a certain typeface.</p>
<p>Some foundries offer PDF specimens, you could collect them and print them out, put them in a binder. But that&rsquo;s limited by your own output quality.</p>
<p>With printed type specimens, you can &ldquo;collect&rdquo; your favorites without having to buy them, as you&rsquo;ve described. Look, enjoy, and become familiar with the typeface and what it can do, so that when a good use for it comes along, you can be confident in buying it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jesse,</p>
<p>Your original post mentions &ldquo;collecting typefaces&rdquo; which sounds like buying type to add to your own type library. I realized you meant collecting <em>samples of typefaces</em>, not the fonts themselves, but it wasn&rsquo;t clear from your first post. Of course, the one can lead to the other, and we encourage that.   ; )</p>
<p>I think Tiff&rsquo;s method of filing by foundry or designer is useful; use it for the inspiration samples, and then later when you&rsquo;re building your type library, use it again for the actual fonts. You could make up your own classifications; text and display, techno, script, etc. etc. There&rsquo;s very little agreement about how to classify type, and fortunately, you are free to use whatever method suits you on your own machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great thing to do; collect samples, specimens, screenshots, for later reference. I have a folder on my hard drive where I put all my downloaded PDF specimens, which I rename with foundry and typeface name, if that isn&rsquo;t already obvious. I print specimens for text faces only, on the laser printer at work (which in my case is a nice 1200 dpi machine). Those I keep together near the other, rarer specimens from the foundries. Display faces are easier to understand and assess onscreen, so I leave those in digital form only.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why there aren&rsquo;t printed specimens available anymore. I consider them essential to demonstrating a good typeface. I&rsquo;m sure most would cite the cost of producing them. SInce there are so many micro-foundries, and the economy of developing a typeface is so different now, very few can justify the marketing expense. Even Adobe, whose Adobe Originals program continues at present, stopped printing their amazing specimen books in the 90&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a shame, because type made for print needs to be shown in print, and without a specimen, graphic and book designers are left guessing whether something will work for them. I suspect that most designers will not do hours of research or spend resources making their own specimens (without the typefaces, how could you?), they will simply revert to using the old, tried-and-true faces they&rsquo;ve been using since 1989; Times, Adobe Garamond, Univers, etc.</p>
<p>Small foundries especially have very little budget for marketing, and most likely, they have no experience in marketing either. What to spend money on? Where are designers looking for new type? It&rsquo;s a puzzle. Larger foundries have abandoned most print media for marketing type, so it&rsquo;s all becoming sadly virtual. I&rsquo;m sure the increase in onscreen reading, fed by the internet and digital content (news, blogs, e-mail), and the fonts made for screen reading (MS ClearType) are factors as well.</p>

I&rsquo;m working with the deluxe version for a long time now, but as far as I remember this option was given in the light version, too &ndash; the difference was, that with the deluxe-Version it&rsquo;s possible to assign your fonts to folders. 
With &ldquo;typograf&rdquo; there are even more options, e.g. comparing fonts directly or get more elaborated infos.</div>

<p>We could probably get most of the foundaries to agree to let us host type pdf&rsquo;s for them right? Or have links on the wiki to go exactly to the downloads for pdf&rsquo;s at the different foundaries. Or emails/ links to places like Enschedé Font Foundry to request samples.</p>

And in case you don&rsquo;t have an adequate 1200 dpi laser printer, 
I&rsquo;d like to add a book which contains lots of (dutch) examples: 
Jan Middendorp&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9064504601/qid=1151830192/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-2843477-5801704?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Dutch Type</a>.
Another option to get printed examples is at conferences.</div>

<p>From their <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=underware&id2=publications&id3=isnot1&id4=general">website</a>: &ldquo;Is Not take-away #1 is the first portable issue of Is Not Magazine. It is also the new, comprehensive type sampler from Underware, showing their fonts both in use and indexed.&rdquo;</p>
