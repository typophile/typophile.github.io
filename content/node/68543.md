  Fonts</a> typefaces about 14 years ago. Some of the old versions were shit and I''m
  sure lots of designers had technical headaches working with them . . . or convincing
  clients to use a proper font. But I''ve been improving them over the years. Currently
  MyFonts is the only place that carries the very latest versions. My point is: if
  you have the misfortune of having problems with an early Larabie Font, please try
  the latest version. If it''s still screwed, contact me and I''ll fix it.'

    Asian hideout.

    used too much anymore, but I still think Neuropol is a great one, if only I could
    get versions of the e and a to have the short parts longer. I've also seen it
    used on a TV show on Discovery or the History Channel.\r\n\r\nAny way of looking
    at a timeline of what fonts were updated and when?"

  body: 'I don''t have a timeline of when fonts are updated. I made an attempt to
    keep track a few years ago but since I update version numbers, I figured there
    was no point . . . I don''t think anyone will ever really care about all the interim
    versions. Just assume that if you didn''t get a font from MyFonts you have an
    old version: they''re the only distributor with an automated mechanism for sending
    updated versions to users.'
