  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\n  I'm a student too and I'll try to give you my honest and humble
    opinion.\r\n\r\n  The first thing that came into my mind (and I know it's really
    odd) was the Mettallica lettering, specially K, N, R, Z, Y, Z... Don't ask me
    why but it reminds me, with a bold modern look.\r\n  I think it's still inconsistent.
    You should work it better specially on details, and structure, like, why does
    the B doesn't have counterform? Why the Q's and O's counterform is smaller than
    C's and G's? And there's more, but I'm afraid to sound annoying and too boring.\r\n\r\n
    \ I'm working on a font too, that it's kinda \"similar\" to this of yours.\r\n
    \ If you want to share opinions more properly give-me your e-mail and I'll send
    you mine, as I don't want to show it off \"typophile forum scale\" if you know
    what I mean :).\r\n\r\n  Plus you should make some test prints with various sizes
    and with real phrases or words, to get a notion of how it works on real, specific
    applications, that you should decide to. I assume it's meant to be a poster application?..\r\n\r\n
    \ Regards, and good work!\r\n  Jo\xE3o"

    overbite problem.\r\n/J/ Does it need a flat bottom? The /U/ isn't flat.\r\n/M/
    and /W/ both seem naked without those extra notches.\r\nThe counter could be more
    uniform. No?\r\n/4/ seems a tad wide, same for /5/ and /2/.\r\nCould the /1/ have
    a notch or something. Hmm. Maybe?\r\nWhy no counters on /4/, /6/, /8/, /9/, and
    /0/?"

  body: "Thanks,\r\n\r\nThis is gonna be for a poster, business card, letterhead,
    website and for my own logo.\r\n\r\nAlready did some print tests, works fine as
    a logo on a business card, the counter on the /O/ was almost gone so it makes
    sense making it bigger.\r\n\r\nGonna keep the counters out of the numbers for
    now, I kinda like it like that and it helps to seperate the zero and /O/. The
    counters look fine on /4/, /6/, /9/ and /0/ but not on the /8/, to me it makes
    more sense to leave them all out.\r\n\r\nI noticed the overbite issue on /F/ but
    I think it's a cool /F/, tried some variations but nothing decent came out of
    it.\r\n\r\nMade some changes trying to make it more consistent.\r\n\r\nMade changes
    to /C/, /B/, /E/, /G/, /J/, /M/, /O/, /Q/, /W/, /3/ and /8/.\r\n\r\nRight now
    when I'm looking at the letter the /B/ looks odd to me.\r\n\r\nLet me know what
    you think,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile2_3415.jpg]"

    to me.\r\n\r\nM is better :)\r\n\r\nF should be similar to E instead of T.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest is great, I like the negative space :)\r\n\r\nAh, and why the upper counter
    of B is smaller in thickness? It should be equal in my opinion.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the name is such a difficult task since there's a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot
    of fonts over the internet. Since you're Finnish (?) I suggest that you name it
    with a Finnish name.\r\n\r\nCheers \r\nJo\xE3o"

  body: "Some more updates.\r\n\r\nThe R was thinner then all the other characters
    for some reason so I fixed that. I like my F so I'm not gonna change it yet. Also
    added a cut on the U. The B looks wierd when the upper counter is the same thickness.\r\n\r\nDecided
    to go with the name Fatman. Added a extra character ( a bomb). Fatman was the
    name of one of the nuclear bombs that America dropped on Japan in WWII. Also made
    a poster for the final assesment in my type design class.\r\n\r\nStill gonna work
    some more on it and make it into a proper font with more special characters.\r\n\r\nSo
    if you have any more feedback to give, please do.\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile4_3720.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile6_3534.jpg]"

  body: "Hej Peter,\r\n\r\nYour font is coming nicely along.  Nice to see the notch
    in the letter U.  For what it's worth, the J strikes me as much too skinny; L
    is a bit small, too.  I'd also encourage you to consider balancing the R a little
    more (smaller bowl, bigger leg) and adding notches or something to the F.  The
    word \"FATMAN\" in your graphics above is more or less illegible at that size.
    \ Other than that, nice work.\r\n\r\nIn case it hasn't already come to your attention,
    there are already several fonts named Fatman out there:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/atype/fatman/]]\r\n[[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/SearchPage.htm?kid=Los%20Alamos%20Pro%20Fat%20Man]]\r\n[[http://www.searchfreefonts.com/free/fatman.htm]]\r\n\r\nYou
    could add yours to the list, but on the other hand you might consider a name that
    hasn't already been used...  \"Ginormity\"? \"Humongous\"? \"Larger Than Life\"?\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, best of luck."

  body: "Yeah I started looking at J and L. Gonna try some other versions with them.
    I could try and take the bowl from P and apply it to the R then the leg would
    become bigger as well.\r\n\r\nThese two poster are A3 and A2 as originals. Just
    posted this size for the forum. The size works fine as printed posters. Also on
    the business cards it's ok, meant to be used in big sizes though.\r\n\r\nProbably
    gonna stick with the name. Got a concept going with the nuclear bomb of the same
    name that America droppen on Japan and I put an extra character in there that's
    supposed to be the bomb. If I change the name it dosen't work anymore. I don't
    mind that there are fonts called Fatman already.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nWill post
    updates soon.\r\nPeter"

    not so much. The P looks really wierd. R is interesting, might try something like
    that for my R as well.

  body: i think for what it is, it looks really good. my only qualm is that it looks
    really similar to every other font designed in 2009. but it's obviously a play
    off of what's currently going on in hip type design, and as part of that milieu,
    i really like it. the line going into the c and g, and ? all feel a tiny tiny
    bit too thick. that's it though. nice.
