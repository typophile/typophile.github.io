So I figure it's worth looking into building my own. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since I'm already a hard core FOG user, I can't help but want to base my origins on this application and improve it as I have always wanted to see it improved. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However due to my own technical limitations, I have always assumed making a font editor is heavy business until I found out about RealBasic.

This software is for pc's only right now and costs about fifty bucks.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use it at work here because I only do very rudimentary font creation and this software is cheaper than fontographer. But it is quite hefty for shareware. As a matter of fact, as far as shareware goes it is one of the best in any category.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would love to see it 'ported' to OS X so I would have an inexpensive (did someone say cheap) alternative to stretch my puny typographic wings on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyways, I think he would be a great resource to start with even though it is a different platform. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tom</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the tips John! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last evening I opened up FOG in ResEdit on the mac and looked for ways to &quot;hack&quot; away at this baby but even after spending some time playing with the app, I was unable to do little more than change some dialog boxes and a few images. I thought I made big changes and then ran the app and no different or little different. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was hoping to get deep enough into the application to figure out how to alias all the cursors and just see how much I could do with it - Like soupin' up my old bike. Let me know if you have found any good hacks for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Otherwise, perhaps RealBasic isn't the best editor for this type of project, but with little serious programming experience other than HTML I truly wonder how difficult it really is to create an application that can do what FOG can. It's surprising how very basic it is and I would imagine some folks already have a good start on vector apps from RealBasic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The thing that frustates me is that it would seem there is a way to build applications but because I don't have the knowledge, I am severly stuck with what's our there vs. what I can create. It's alot like font creation but in a different industry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyhow, thanks for the insight, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's not really possible to change the behavior of FOG using ResEdit, just the surface appearance (and even that only in a limited way). ResEdit was created mainly as a way to separate the &quot;look&quot; of an application from the code to facilitate localization. The CODE resources that you can see in there are in a form that's not practical to modify&ndash;it's already compiled and linked. Making even the tiniest change in one of those could totally hose FOG.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My ideal font editing program: The basic interface would be like FOG's metrics window, but you would be able to edit the outline too. Having a separate window to edit each glyph has always seemed rather limiting to me, and that they're done this way because that's the way it's alway been done. Apple's old bitmap font editor (FontEdit) was an exception. It would be especially handy for scripts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mark, I work in roughly the manner you've illustrated, using FontLab, by working with the preview panel open. I can set words using the glyph I'm editing and see how my changes work in context. I can edit the side bearings in the outline editing window. If I decide that I need to edit another glyph in the sample word, a double click in the preview window makes it the current glyph in the frontmost editing window. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WRT building a font editor from scratch - I've spent enough time writing code to know a bit about estimating the possibility of a project.

It reminds me of the early versions of Illustrator where you couldn't draw and preview at the same time in the same window, so you would have two windows open&ndash;one to draw in and one to see what it looked like.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this &quot;one glyph&ndash;one window&quot; idea is just something that's been around so long that it's never been questioned. Imagine if drawing programs worked like this. Each object would be stored in a library and could only be edited in its own window and could only be seen in context in a &quot;layout&quot; mode. It would be a real impediment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not going to stop making fonts just because the tools could be better. The tools we have are light-years beyond what people used to create metal or photo type. But they could be better.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think too many of the folks involved in this discussion don't quite understand the number of person-hours required to develop good software. If your goal is to make fonts, I'd focus on either that, or incremental improvements to existing tools (FontLab or FontForge). If you want to get into the font editor business, then be prepared to spend a huge portion of your time for the next few years to do it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That being said, FontLab's drawing capabilities are fully exposed to Python. That means that you can do additional drawing tools yourself and add them to FontLab. They already added FOG-like tools to FL 4.6 by doing this. If you don't like the way they did it, why not start by modifying their Python code? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It would be easier to change the drawing UI of FontLab than to get Fontographer up to FontLab's level of capabilities, IMO. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My two cents. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P.S.

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, I don't know if you realize, but most of the above discussion was from about a year ago.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, it looks like Yuri is working something along the same lines as my &quot;fantasy&quot; suggestion for FontLab (see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I totally agree with you about the impracticality of making a new font editor from scratch. Especially if all you want to do is make fonts. I gave up on that idea myself when FOG was released in 1985. :-)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After finishing my most recent batch of fonts last Fall, I switched cold-turkey to FontLab and I'm getting very used to it now. I really like the fact that they listen to customer suggestions and keep improving it. I have no doubt that it will just keep getting better (and it's already very good). It just takes some getting used to after working with FOG for so many years.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another thought: I think the preview mode should match in the Glyph window with the current glyph and the adjacent glyphs.

		<div class="commentbody">Yet another thought: I assume that all those adjacent glyphs are just for looking at and not directly editable. However, what would be cool is if you double-click on one of them, the Glyph window would switch to that glyph (similar to using the glyph palette at the bottom of the Glyph window), and the preview glyphs would shift left or right accordingly. (I don't think you'd want this to be invoked by a single click since it might cause difficulties in cases where glyphs overlap.)</div>
