    is unintentional, as Vista Slab comes directly from the very original Vista Sans,
    but the Slab could be considered a contemporary [[ITC Officina|Officina]].\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vista-slab_6359.png]\r\n\r\nVista

  body: "As usual, Dupr\xE9's italics are really great. Vista Slab: that's probably
    the most natural looking double-story italic 'g' I've seen."

  body: "Thanks Coles for your observation. I would have not readily correlated a
    Officina and Vista slab. Nice catch.\r\n\r\nPersonally, looking at the two designs
    here, I would say that Officina is a little bit more well thought out in terms
    of low-res printing and reader cognition. Notice the inktraps on the r, a, u,
    and the p. Also, the diacritics seem a little bit more friendly to the designer
    short on vertical space. Vista Slab looks more like a stylistic expansion as opposed
    to a learned industrial-strength compact multi-use type system. (Of course, I
    don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, but anyway)\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    I\u2019m totally digging it. You like the lowercase italic g, I love the lowercase
    italic x and k. \r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Thank you Mickey & Stephen for your accurate comments. I'm fully agreed.
    \r\nThe comparison with Officina is not a surprise because Vista Sans was inspired
    by <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=200\">Spiekermann</a>  shapes
    - like Meta - and when I added serifs to Vista Sans, I kept in mind Officina but
    I deliberately didnt oserve it and tried - in vain - to forget it."
