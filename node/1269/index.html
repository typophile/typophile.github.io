		<div class="commentbody">&gt;relativism is a way of thinking with doubt  <BR> <BR>I agree, but I think there are much better ways to acknowledge our fallibility and the uncertainty of all our beliefs.  <BR> <BR>Popper, with whom I studied, forged a third path between the Positivists - who wanted certainty or a surrogate for it - and relativists who wanted to do away with truth as a regulative idea. His idea was that we strive through collective effort and looking at evidence to improve our grasp of reality, though it is never sure.  <BR> <BR>The problem with the relativist way of saying that truth is relative and there is no reality is that it destroys rational argument.  <BR> <BR>In my view it is quite wrong to think that relativism supports tolerance and open-mindedness. In fact, tolerance of the relativist only goes so far as he or she interacts with you. It allows for no rational discussion between people who disagree, for their two viewpoints are equally valid, and there is no reality, or evidence of reality to shed light on which is best. Argument is killed.  <BR> <BR>Heidigger and his followers don't debate issues, they just pontificate.  <BR> <BR>Relativism is in fact profoundly illiberal. My mentioning Sartre and Heidigger's tolerance of totalitarean regimes was actually on point. They are greatly admired by contemporary relativists, and they illustrate that anything can be justified by relativism. Relativism seems to be humble, but in fact is a supremely arrogant philosophy. <BR> <BR>For a start, when you deny reality, you can deny the reality of the suffering of others.  <BR> <BR>Popper in fact saw the upholding of standards of rationality as key to the advancement of knowledge and to regimes that were open to listening to the people and bettering their lot. And he argued so in his famous book 'The Open Society and its Enemies', specifically against the Nazi and Communist tyranies he had seen arise during his lifetime. <BR> <BR>A year ago I attended the Centennial celebration of Popper's birth in Vienna, and was touched by people from all over the world for whom his ideas had been a beacon of humaneness and liberalism under oppressive regimes. <BR> <BR>&gt;it appears to me a little pretentious to say : i have the truth, it's this, or that.  <BR> <BR>I agree completely that to claim you are certain that you know the truth is pretentious and even ridiculous. And I never said or believed such a thing. But it is equally ridiculous to deny that there are such things as truths and reality.  <BR> <BR>And no, the first tests of reality - as I have said earlier and no one have given any counter argument - are not linguistic. A child learns the reality of objects (which yes are partly an hypothesis - a true hypothesis) before language. Animals also learn about reality of objects, other animals, food and sex without ever speaking.  <BR> <BR>Relativism is just an excuse to dismiss those you don't agree with, rather that having to look at facts, and search for the truth. It is the death of reason, and as Hogarth said, &quot;The death of reason gives birth to monsters.&quot; <BR></div>

It's not that important. I really think trying to figure how we perceive that rock, with all our senses (because here, the vision seems to be the only one) is more interesting. <BR> <BR>That lacks in your way of thinking, in my view, is something else than reason. Of course, reason is one of the thing that make us humans, and the most. But we feel, too, and many things are in us which are all but reason. Believings, customs, etc</div>

As far as I've been able to tell, William and I are both arguing that there is such a thing as the real and the true. Neither of us has claimed that we can know the real or the true in its totality (although it isn't a logical impossibility, only an empirical improbability based on our limited perception and imperfect reason (and leaving aside for now the question of revelation)). <BR> <BR>Guillaume, I'm not sure that we mean the same thing by relativism. You seem to be saying that we live with doubt about many things, and need to discuss and debate these things and try to come up with reasonable and generally agreeable ways of behaving based on whatever much or little we can determine. I have no argument with that, and I don't think that constitutes relativism.</div>

But he thinks the only alternative to relativism is dogmatism, and that is why he mistakes me for a dogmatist.   <BR> <BR>Guillaume, the word 'paradigm' in the sense you are using it was introduced by Thomas Kuhn, partly in criticism of Popper.

Particularly in science we move closer to the truth about reality through such a testing process. <BR> <BR>So far, our understanding of social process is much weaker, but even in politics basic truths are important. For example, the economic (as well as moral) failure of centrally planned Leninist states eventually has led to abandonment of this economic model. Acknowledgement of the failure is from observing such mundane facts as the wealth in the Leninist states vs the mixed economies of the West and East Asia.  <BR> <BR>The mundane facts matter because they help guide us to greater truths, if we are looking for them.

		<div class="commentbody">ouh good examples. <BR>I guess  agreeing in solidity of rock may be important for hard sciences. But you've always understood that's not my &quot;speciality&quot; if i have one. <BR>About your politic example, with the wealth of URSS you missed a marxist &quot;paradigm&quot; here. For the Marx ideas to work, after what he said, the revolution need to take place in a wealth country. That wasn't really the case of the Russia, if i'm not wrong; Marx spoke, too, of an industrialised country while Russian people were mainly peasants.  <BR>And i'd be very careful with &quot;wealth&quot;. Because URSS, with all the  there was in that i can't deny, was also, thanks to the state, nearly totally alphabetised, for example. That's not nothing, especially for us i think (well, one can say too that Saddam got a unesco education prize in the end of the 70's). <BR>The problem of your idea of &quot;testing&quot; is that things are more complicated. Testing one side doesn't tell any truth. It may eventually tell one particular irrelevant truth of the side tested, but that's all. <BR>Abandoning the idea of truth don't mean abandoning the idea of search. You've just to know that while searching</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guillaume, you can't use logic without the concept of truth. When you throw out truth, then contradictions are permitted. And it is a basic principle of logic at anything follows from a contradiction. All fruitful debate goes out the window. The beautiful Socratic tradition is killed.   <BR> <BR>Testing doesn't tell you which theories are true, but it is a very good indication of which theories are false. It is up to us to invent better theories that are consistent with all the evidence, and then test them further. <BR> <BR>In politics, the acknowledgement of the suffering caused or not caused by policies are very important mundane truths. Refusing to be guided by them as a reality is &quot;dangerous. Very dangerous.&quot;  <BR> <BR>I have continued to comment in this thread because I dislike seeing what I view as a poison in intellectual life going unchallenged. <BR> <BR>I wanted to make clear that there is a well-developed alternative to the fashionable relativism, and to inform people that there is third side to the story - you don't have to be either a relativist or dogmatist. And that relativism may not be a benign, tolerant philosophy.  <BR> <BR>By the way, Popper did point out, as Guillaume notes, that the socialist revolution taking place first in a poor country (Russia) refutes Marx. It is in fact an example of how social facts are important to testing theories in social science and politics, as well as physical science.  <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I know pretty well that contradictions are permitted. I'd say hopefully, because if not all arguing become sterile and dead. As for me, the socrate tradition is rotten. One man asks questions with the answers inside, and the poor partner only can say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;exactly&quot; or synonyms. Not fruiful, in my view. Socrate was really interesting, and beautiful in many ways, but he was also a pure dogmatist, not really interested in ideas of others, mocking of revolutionary people who wanted to discuss slavery etc. He was, also, a very fine rhetorician. <BR>The acknolewdgement of sufferings caused by policies is, of course, important. But you really can say neither stalinism nor nazism are relativism. Because people precisely can't question anything in that systems. <BR>And you can also search for the goods, even in the more horrible systems, 'cause there are still some. My idea is to try to think with all the complexity possible. <BR>You obviously have to simplify to make any system, any frame of analysis. But if, after that, you don't come back to the complexity (and so on, classical dialectic), you loose many things and surely goes to something irrelevant. <BR> <BR>I just wonder something : is Popper</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; William and I are both arguing that <BR> <BR>Is it a coincidence that both of you are strongly religious? It probably works great for you - maybe it gives your lives meaning for you - you're lucky. But I have to say I see a problem with anything based purely on faith <i>when you try to mix it up with people outside your village</i>. But a more nagging problem is that William holds his religion firmly behind his back so we can't see it (probably because he knows that some people will [rightly] hold that against him), whereas you at least don't try to hide it consistently. This is not a distraction - it really is the heart of the matter. <BR> <BR>BTW, I would also apply this to Jon Coltz's thread, but I think that's better left alone. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I appreciate that you are seeking the truth on these matters! <BR> <BR>&gt; I know pretty well that contradictions are permitted. <BR> <BR>Sorry, I wasn't clear. Of course contradictions are permitted in the sense that different views of the truth contradict one another. What I meant was that if contradictory views are accepted as equally valid, or correct or true, then debate and scientific testing are both impossible. I can for example accept both a universal theory and evidence that conflicts with it. But this acceptance of conflicting viewpoints as valid (one for one person or group, the other for the other) is precisely what relativism does.    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR></div>

I'm with Gottlob Frege on that. <BR> <BR>Until language corresponds exactly to what is real, contradictory views can indeed be accepted as equally valid.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;The thing is that you really absoloutly want to judge. You don't want just to learn and build a living on a fruitful learning, which doesn't necessary evaluate. <BR> <BR>Guillaume, the idea that you yourself don't make judgments is a mistaken idea.  <BR> <BR>You make a judgment every time to decide to eat the food rather than the plate, every time you step over a hole in the road.  <BR> <BR>You also make judgments of other people and political judgments - such as the one you made above about bad things that went on in the Soviet Union. We all make judgments, I just think it is a better idea to make them after looking at evidence and grounding them as much in reality as possible. Using logic and reason is part of being a responsibile human being. So is being open-minded enough to accept new evidence and argument and change one's mind.  <BR> <BR>The relativist's claim not to make judgments is just pretense, not reality. It shows the hollowness of the philosophy.  <BR> <BR>I never said that Nazis or Communists were relativists. I said that Heidegger and Sartre used relativism to defend them. My point was that once you break loose your standards from evidence and reality, anything goes.  <BR> <BR>I see from your bio here that you are a student. If you are interested you can get Popper's works in French. I think 'Conjectures and Refutations' is his best. My own book on Popper, 'Learning from Error' is in English and a German translation (Lernen aus dem Irrtum), but not in French.  <BR> <BR>&gt;If enough people are involved, calling something a 'leg', does actually make it a leg. If the Oxford English Dictionary says it's a leg, who am I to argue?  <BR> <BR>With all due respect, Matha, you miss the point of Lincoln's story: changing language doesn't change reality. The fixing of meaning is conventional - the sound 'he' refers to a man in English and to a woman in Hebrew. But once the meanings are relatively fixed in a language community, then sentences refer to reality, and are true or false. The reality doesn't change even though we may get it wrong or fail to understand it.  <BR> <BR>For example once 'weapons of mass destruction' is given a clear meaning, the claim that they were in Iraq gets meaning, and the reality of whether they were there or not doesn't change no matter what George Bush or Hans Blix says. <BR> <BR>The idea that language determines reality is such a crock. Eating keeps us alive, sex makes babies - and you don't need talk when you are doing either one!  <BR> <BR>&gt;William, I see your point, but I guess we must have  <BR>different tresholds, no offense. <BR> <BR>Yves, no offense given or taken. I noted the rudeness because don't think it should be accepted as a normal course of action, on these boards or anywhere else.   <BR> <BR>&gt;instead of taking advice <BR> <BR>Hrant, I recently accepted 100% of your typographic advice on my book project, and thanked you for your kindness. And meant it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, i obviously make judgements everytime. And of course, when the question is important, logic and reason are my better friends (well, let say apart about love). <BR>But i try to avoid them as much as i can when they're not needed. And, all the more, i try not to make judgements systematically. If something is pure occidental, it's that frenetic need to eveluate, to give labels. I am myself pushed to do that, as it's a main point of our culture, but i try as much as i can not to do so if the situation don't call for a judgement. Just a free look. <BR>About it as a phylosophy, you know, a philosophy hasn't to be taken litteraly for living. Maybe i just have, as i want it, to try to do it more often. <BR>For now i really haven't time to read anything else than what i already have to, but when i'll have such time, i'll try to get a look on your master. I think my reading of Leo Strauss make me a quite honest idea of your position ? <BR>About language. Of course it doesn't determine reality itself. But it sure determines the way we see it, and so the way we analyse it, because we simply haven't any other way to think. <BR>I disagree strongly that WMD has a clear sense. Planes driven by fanatic people are now supposed to be so. If any unexpected use of something potentially dangerous on a big scale, it would be added on the list. So it's not that clear. I'm just studying that for my work, so it's not a so easy question. And here, particuliarly, what Bush says change many things because he can say &quot;they are there&quot; without being sure</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If the dictionary says that what used to be called a dog's <b>tail</b> is now called a <b>leg</b>, it is most definitely now a <b>leg</b>. It's shape or function or colour obviously doesn't change but the reason for calling it a tail (ie. this was it's given name) has disappeared. Would you continue to call it a 'tail' under those circumstances? When a company changes its name, do you continue to use the old name? <BR> <BR>Compare the way you look at a <b>tail</b> that is renamed a <b>leg</b> with someone who has never seen either a leg or a tail. Wait a generation and compare your reaction with someone who wasn't alive when a tail was a tail. In a leg you see an ex-tail. The youngsters just see a leg. The interaction with reality is different on the level of the language and the poor dog can't do anything about it. <BR> <BR>Take Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland. They see the same geographical area completely differently. You might say we are talking about opinions here but when opinions are codified in constitutions they tend to encourage people to interpret reality in a particular way.  <BR> <BR>The definition of a nation is a good example of how reality (because in this case the reality of the situation is based on vague abstract principles expressed through even vaguer language) can be completely different depending on your age/religion/ethnic background. <BR> <BR>What is reality in a country where two groups accuse each other of oppression and claim victim status for themselves.

		<div class="commentbody">About the leg and the tail: <BR> <BR>Matha, yes we can start calling a dog's tail a leg, and if we establish the convention it might stick. But most people want language to be useful &ndash; not perfect, not all revealing and encompassing &ndash; just useful for talking about the reality around them. Calling a dog's tail a leg doesn't change the nature of the thing attached to a dog's arse. It remains pysically different from the other things we call leg. So by calling tails legs we've just made language less useful because we've removed the linguistic distinction between things that are distinct in reality. <BR> <BR>Now, and this is quite interesting, language reflects cultural priorities insofar as language embodies classification. The distinction between tail and leg is one of classification, and the fact that we have two separate words for them indicates that we consider the classification to be important. It is conceivable that there is another culture that would have a single word for 'long skinny things attached to the body of a dog', which would be used for both legs and tails. Such a word would indicate that this culture has never considered the physical or functional differences between legs and tails to be important: they have different priorities in classification. <BR> <BR>So language reflects priority in the classification of reality, but it does not affect the nature of that which is classified: the physical and functional distinctions between legs and tails persist whether a language defines the distinctions or not. Calling a tail a leg does not change the dog, only the language.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Where i disagree with you, Joseph, is when you say that intention and language are two different things. The language isn't a pure system, to take out of context. The context is part of the language. The system is virtually pure, but everytime it's used, it become a more complex (and confusing) thing, made of phonems, letters, significations, voice, attitude etc. You can't separate the different elements that are a whole thing once it's used.

It's irrelevant.</i> <BR> <BR>I never said one 'word = one thing', although Matha indicated that it is desirable (this is why I recommended Eco's history of the vain search for a perfect language). Of course words can have multiple meanings, and the clearer you want to be about your meaning the more words you need to use to clarify how you are using specific phrases. <BR> <BR>However, one word = anything is also irrelevant, and not only that it is dangerous. We can and should, for example, demand a specific definition of 'weapons of mass destruction' from our political leaders, and they can and should provide such a definition: it is possible to state what they mean, even if it isn't in their interests to do so. The vagueness isn't in the language, it is in the intention not to use language clearly. <BR> <BR>Between the vain idea of a perfect language, in which there is a one-to-one natural correspondence of word and thing, and the vain idea of total deconstruction of meaning in which there is no correspondence of word and thing other than a momentary and individual interpretive one, there is the linguistic world that most people operate in on a daily basis. There are conventional correspondences between words and things embodied in usage, and these can be explained and understood in terms of a matrix of such correspondences. So when I say 'This is a duck', I can go on to explain what a bird is, what distinguishes this duck bird from other birds, and can relate all these concepts to physical specimens. There is no one-to-one natural correspondence between the word duck and the thing duck, not least because there are different breeds of duck and the word duck is also a verb that has nothing to do with water fowl, but we have adequate functionality of language in talking about the thing we call a duck. If the functionality wasn't adequate, we would make it adequate by devising new ways of talking about the thing, which is something at which we are very adapt. <BR> <BR>As an aside, the fact that you call me Joseph does not make me Joseph <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">As people still want to talk about this, I will put in one more round.  <BR> <BR>Yes, language is sometimes ambiguous, a social product, and some concepts (such as justice) are interpreted differently by different cultures.  <BR> <BR>All this does not change the fact that there are a huge number of simple facts on which almost everyone agrees: that there many different languages, that we need food to live, and so on. It is this very broad agreement on observed facts that provides a basis for testing more general ideas, and for cross-cultural communication.  <BR> <BR>The reality of many ambiguities in language does not answer my, and Popper's point that these basic agreed-upon observations (including of observation of human suffering) provide a basis for common communication and for meaningful debate in science and politics. <BR> <BR>Matha, if you do not address the importance of cross-culturally agreed-upon observational facts, then you are not answering Popper's argument against relativism.   <BR> <BR>Guillaume, I think your concept of 'absolute truth' does not characterize Popper's view. He distinguishes between truth in the ordinary sense of the statement 'most dogs are born with four legs' being true, and the sense of Truth being about the meaning of life etc. Incidently, if you are interested, the logician Alfred Tarski defined this simple sense of 'truth' in formal logic. <BR> <BR>Your view that we cannot get closer to the truth, and therefore the concept of truth is useless, is one which Popper would contest. For example, we are closer to understanding the truth about the nature of the moon than people were a thousand years ago. <BR> <BR>Having already tried the patience of those not interested in philosophy, I am reluctant to go further in this thread. My article 'Skeptical Rationalism' (Inquiry, 22, p. 281-230) lays out my own views in depth.  <BR> <BR>The main question I would have for Matha and Guillaume is: What is gained by being a relativist? If you think the answer is a more tolerant point of view, I think you are making a serious mistake - though one that has nothing to do with type!  <BR> <BR></div>

I can see that you truly believe in science (which is fine by me) but I wonder how repeatable such scientific observations would be if the number of people tested was increased to something really really enormous. A test involving millions or billions is obviously outside the scope of any scientific study but would most likely reveal patterns far less repeatable than in anything done so far. The relatively small scale of scientific studies like this hides more than it reveals. <BR> <BR>I recently read that in a worldwide study, women were discovered to be better than men at reading in 100% of partcipating countries.

You will know from it pretty quickly whether you want to go further. 'Conjectures and Refutations' contains some of his best, and most accessible essays. There is also a very good anthology, in England called 'A Pocket Popper', edited by David Miller. I would start with one of the essays in 'Conjectures' or the 'Unended Quest', though. <BR> <BR>'The Logic of Scientific Discovery' and 'The Open Society and Its Enemies' are Popper's major works, but I wouldn't start with them. <BR> <BR>For secondary material on Popper, on philosophy of science, I think my book with John Wettersten, 'Learning from Error' can be helpful: It puts Popper into the tradition of the tradition of cognitive psychology, which makes it much easier to understand what he is up to. (It is out of print but you can get it in University libraries.)  <BR> <BR>On politics and the social sciences, the recent book by Malachi Hacohen 'Karl Popper: The Formative Years' is very revealing about the political background of Poppers work.</div>
