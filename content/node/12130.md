  style of [[blackletter]] type popularized in the [[20th century]] that split the
  distance between the heavy industrial grotesques popular in the West (such as [[Akzidenz
  Grotesk]]) and the [[blackletter]] types predominant in the Teutonic world. Hitler,
  who had a preference for classic Roman imperial inscriptional letters, was one of
  the chief exponents of this style of type, which became explicitly identified with
  Nazi ideas of [[German nationalism]]. The names of the typefaces -- [[Deutschland]],
  National, [[Tannenberg]] -- reveal this connection. Schaftstiefelgrotesks bear the
  same relationship to traditional German blackletters that [[grotesque]] [[sans serif]]
  types do to traditional serifed Latin type: they are simplified, weighted versions
  of the forms, sturdier and less refined. The name, given to the style by typesetters,
  is ironic. Of all the types sullied by association with the Nazis, they are the
  most problematic."
