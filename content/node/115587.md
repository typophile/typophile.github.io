  has placed exceptional emphasis on tracing/copying various typefaces to learn 'by
  heart', so that eventually one can transcend the exisitng and then create something
  original to oneself.\r\nThere is little more information.  \r\nThis is going to
  take me an age.  Am I meant to continue until each character of each typeface is
  absolutely precise?  How many should I learn?  Do I do nothing else except this
  for years?  And continue with each new one I want to use?\r\nI must admit that I'm
  not a little disheartened with the approach.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a 'precision'
  freak and really enjoying the process but can't help be aware of the time limitation
  this is imposing on my actual creativity.\r\nPLEASE can someone help with advice
  before I just give up???"

    \ out of it then you should probably stop the course. Get a refund like @hrant
    said.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions feel free to send me a message. "
