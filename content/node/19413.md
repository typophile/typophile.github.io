  it up to the world in general and i want to use a really ignorant font for the titles
  and the banner across the top. does anyone know if that FontPlayer guy has designed
  any fonts, because his posts here are SO TOTALLY ignorant that i think it would
  be perfect to use his work. also, what colour is ignorance? thanks again for your
  help.\r\n\r\nPS the judy invites were a huge hit!!!"

    doesn't get much more ignorant than the <a href=\"http://images.google.ca/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&q=KKK+poster&btnG=Search\">KKK</a>\r\n"

    unfortunately I doubt your readers would readily identify it, unless you want
    an in-joke. A state of darkness could be used as a metaphor for ignorance, or
    red, white and blue should offend as many ignorami as possible. <a href=\"http://www.stampandshout.com/shop/window-decals/ignorance-is-strength.php\">George
