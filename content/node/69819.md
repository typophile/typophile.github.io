  body: "\"Oceanside\" may be a freebie, or a modification of a narrow sans. The weird
    's' looks like an edited, reversed 'e'. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/garage-gothic/\">Garage
    Gothic</a> is sort of like a possible starting place, if nothing closer is suggested.\r\n\r\n-
