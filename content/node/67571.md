  body: "The serif looks somewhat similar to a typeface called De Vinne No. 11, however
    the G is quite different. Most of the lower case looks quite similar, although
    the weight of No. 11 is a bit too heavy and maybe slightly wider than this sample.
    I saw this in the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\". \r\n\r\nMcGrew shows
    DeVinne Roman done by Frederic Goudy at the end of the 19th century, and except
    for the G it also seems quite close (and even a better weight match) to this sample.\r\n\r\n-
