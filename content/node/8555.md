  <BR> <BR>With Ballpoint, I tried to combine the &#39;accidents&#39; which happen
  by writting with a pen and the cleanness of a welldesigned sanserif. I tried to
  create forms which might give less problems when for example, text is set extremly

  body: ' Like the rest of your work, this is superb.  <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t use
    the name Ballpoint, personally, as it no longer bears much resemblance to handwriting.
    It&#39;s a friendly-looking font, so I&#39;d suggest some sort of casual, friendly
    name.  <BR> <BR>I assume this would be the bold version, as it is already quite
    heavy. The ink traps &#40;I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re called&#41; in characters
    like the V, W, m and n could be made more of a feature of the font in general,
    maybe. The capitals, for example look far less interesting than the lc because
    they are more uniform and you don&#39;t employ those stroke junctions that give
    the lc its hand-drawn style.  <BR> <BR>The lc w and maybe also the v don&#39;t
    work for me. In the w, how about trying a italicesque double &#34;u&#34; shape
    &#40;wide outer strokes and narrow center&#41;?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very interested
    to see how you tackle the finer versions and the italics.  <BR> <BR>This could
    end up being a really popular font. It&#39;s friendly, as I say, but not so cute
    as to seem childish or ironic. I&#39;d work on this before you finish those other
    fonts as it could be your &#34;breakout&#34; design. It is clearly more marketable
    than the other fonts at baronvonfonthausen.de. '

    font is not easy. <BR> <BR>About the Italics. In my 1st sketch you can already
    become an impression how the Italics will be.  <BR> <BR>I am not completely satisfied
    about the Uc either myself. I will have to work on them. Your tip about the inktraps
    might be usefull. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Jacques '

    One suggestion is to eschew the uppercase in favor of a mix of uppper and lower
    with alternates. See &#39;Flit&#39;, one of the new faces @ Fountain. Martin Fredrickson
    nailed another great face, mixing upper and lower cases wonderfully. <BR> <BR>good

  body: ' Jacques, <BR> <BR>I guess the point I was trying to make is...when  you
    use &#39;traditional&#39; letterforms, then there are going to be people who say
    &#39;That looks a lot like ________&#34; But often duplication of form is unintentional
    and difficult to avoid, more difficult perhaps when you have a ultrabold humanist
    face. <BR> <BR>I would guess that M. Fredrickson didn&#39;t seek out to replicate
    Gill Kayo&#39;s letterforms and that any &#39;duplication&#39; happened unintentionally.
    Nevertheless, it is a nice face, but that&#39;s only my perspective. I bought
    the face and have already used it. &#40;You get a lot more appreciation for a
    face if you &#39;test drive&#39; it and see how it performs.&#41; <BR> <BR>One
    thing that this does point out. When you make a traditional face, there are going
    to be echoes -- rare is the &#39;traditional&#39; face that cannot be traced to
    an antecedent.  <BR> <BR>One of the &#39;charms&#39; of this forum is that you
    will find out if there is an antecedent, very soon after you post something. <BR>
