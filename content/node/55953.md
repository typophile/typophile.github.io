  books. I think they could just as well be book covers (except that one should then
  be rotated and the stress changed to vertical).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n<em>PS:
  the translations would be something like \"Dick Poems\" & \"The Flashing of Orange
  on Traffic Lights\"</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Edit: added a third one (\"Getting used to the
  Light\") to complete the series. Corrections to \"Flashing\".</em>"

  body: "My thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Too much space between R and C in \"KURC\". The name
    needs manual kerning, too. Look carefully at the spaces between the letters. Make
    the \"LUD Literatura  2009\" bolder, perhaps in all caps. Lose that star, it adds
    nothing.\r\n\r\n2. Good use of an often misused typeface. Mrs. Eaves was all the
    rage five or ten years ago. The background makes me slightly nauseous, but that's
    probably the intention. Good work.\r\n\r\n3. \"Privajanje\" looks too light, and
    the letterspacing in \"svetlobo\" looks weird. "

  body: "I totally agree about the kerning, thanks for pointing it out. I guess I
    was just too eager to share the layouts with everyone here to even give kerning
    a thought. Lesson learned! I've also made \"Privajanje\" bold.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised
    though that you found the star superfluous. I thought the little sun-like dings
    on the orange one were maybe a bit too much, but if nothing else the author loved
    it. In my oppinion, they all have a rapport with the titles and contents. Believe
    me, however, I fully understand that no explanation or reasoning, no matter how
    brilliant, don't make up for bad art.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the input!\r\n"
