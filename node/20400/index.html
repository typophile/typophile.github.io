<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm a graphic designer from Brazil and I'm working on a article about kitsch influences on digital typography. I've been having some trouble in finding material that elaborates this aspect of typography.
It's not clear to me exactly when the kitsch phenomena started to influence typography (was it in art-nouveau period?).
What books would you guys suggest I read?</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Ed Fella's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568982178/sr=8-1/qid=1149285363/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-7542932-4634452?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Letters on America</a> has a few essays but mostly poloroids of vernacular types along with some pages of his own lettering style.
Kitch type probably wasn't really explored until the dadaist movement but the cubists also incoporated lettering into thier work (though not as kitchy as the dadaists). </div>

<div class=commentbody>Bruno,
Unfortunately, I don't have book suggestions... but perhaps Los Feliz is an example of the type of digital work you are speaking of.
Check out these two links to see the work and its background story.

Well, I'd like to know what do you think are the basic differences between a kitsch and a vernacular type. Just to clarify my thoughts.</div>

<a href=http://www.designobserver.com/archives/010874.html>"Freedom of Speech or Filching of Style? The New Law of Eminent Lo-Mein"</a> by Jessica Helfand, an article from a few months back on DesignObserver.com
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0582357551/002-8329251-8316807?v=glance&n=283155"> Typography and Language in Everyday Life</a> by Sue Walker has an interesting chapter on vernacular typography (not kitsch) with lots of references/ examples of digital typography...
Possibly related, this is some <a href=http://typetalkfonts.com/APapaelias_Presentation.pdf>research</a> i did in grad school ...
Also, Veer and House Industries are both especially successful in marketing the kitsch factor of their typefaces...
Basic differences between kitsch and vernacular type? I suppose this distinction always has to do with intent and context. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I would classify kitsch as something that appeals to popular culture and reflects a more "lowbrow taste". That said , I certainly don't think the lowbrow nature of kitsch always equates to low-quality. A professor I had in college likened kitsch to pink plastic flamingos in peoples' lawns.
Amy provided good examples of quality kitsch typefaces in Veer and House Industries. House Industries has published a book on their own work. Check it out at http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=143

Vernacular is more difficult for me to define. I would classify the Los Feliz sample I recommended earlier as vernacular, as well as Ed Fella's book.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kitsch is my schtick so I'm surprised not to have been mentioned in this thread . . . visit fontdiner.com
Generally speaking, your original question really never was answered . . . Kitsch typography originated shortly after 1942 when America went to war and GIs were returning home. It was a prosperous era for many Americans who had more leisuretime and surplus income.
The demand for entertainment, dining and consumer products was being fed by a hungry audience and so the demand was handily met by companies and advertisers. As a reflection of this time of prosperity and optimism, the typography followed suit.
Part of what enhanced the expressiveness of the letterforms was the stark contrast to the environment the type sat with. There were plenty of 'simple' packaging solutions that called greatly to the type as well as inventive architecture and signage. At this time in history, generally speaking, type was still highly functional in that it needed to serve its purpose as 'directional' or 'informational' but since it was the focus, it had the opportunity to influence the reader by interjecting aspects of personality.
That's my version of Kitsch type in a nutshell . . .

<div class=commentbody>To follow up more on your original question about its influence on digital typography, I'd be inclined to say it probably started with the first digitization of late 40s style photo lettered type. It's hard to say what that font would have been but I suspect a font like Parade or Contrmporary Brush bold which was bundled with Windows 95 would have been among the first.
You'd almost have to find foundry specimen books from 1984 to 1990 to see when digital Kitsch came back . . . Then if you follow the indie fonts boom of the early 1990s you can see when it came more mainstream into the font world through today when we're seeing a resugence of ephemeral influenced typefaces that are being created from original specimens.

<div class=commentbody>I don't know whether Kitsch is really what you are looking for. What Stuart does I think Americans would normally call <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro>retro</a> or nostalgia.
Kitsch is a German word and concept that to some extent has migrated to English. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch>Here</a> is a discussion of its original meaning, which is really negative.
I'm sure others can give more information on how these terms have changed, but to me 'kitch' implies bad taste, and not just nostalgia. </div>

<div class=commentbody>IMHO kitsch lettering is often very ornate (eg snowcapped caps, type constructed out of pieces of stylized wood, ornamented stuff) and that kind of artwork is hard to adapt to a working digital typeface. The PostScript 3 format was often used for that (I think PS3 even supported grayscale), but even then you'd run into errors when trying to output to film (too many linepaths and so on). So maybe there is a reason why not much of the kitsch stuff made it to digital…
(Sorry if this makes no sense, I' m just a graphic designer).</div>

<div class=commentbody>According to Abraham Moles in his book about understanding the Kitsch phenomena, <i>art nouveau</i> is to be considered an example of Kitsch in its germinal form. Later, after WWII, Kitsch became what Moles called Neokitsch. That was when the Gadget Era began.
There are some more contemporary studies that believe Kitsch's third form came to be through the 90s Digital Boom. Umberto Eco used to say that Kitsch is nothing more than the excess of ways to meet one end. That's exactly what we see happening on this popularization of graphic softwares - so many tools to make a single flyer.
I think that labeling Kitsch just as "bad taste" is not to fully realise the size and importance this phenomena has on our everyday lives. Kitsch is much more than just an adjective; it's how one relates to an object or to some graphic elements, like typefaces. What I'm trying to do on my studies is to understand how this digital typography boom from the 90s effectively brought back the Kitsch culture from the beginning of the XX century.</div>
