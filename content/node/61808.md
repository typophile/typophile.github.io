  decided to significantly trim down some of the obscuring features. This is the result,
  but there are still improvements that can be made. Here is what it looks like so
  far. The text setting here is a bit ambitious but I hope it reveals some of the
  problems that need working out. Please critique me!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEric"

  body: "Interesting. It isn't very wide, but it feels wide. \r\n\r\ny - the tail
    seems a little thin\r\nt - the cross-stroke seems a little long\r\ng - the bottom
    bowl looks squooshed\r\ng - not sure about the ear\r\nd - the bottom of the belly
    seems pinched.\r\nb - the notch where the stroke and stem meet should be more
    defined\r\n\r\nb & d - maybe the bowls need to be a little more square?\r\n\r\nStill
    pretty readable at small sizes. The wide spacing helps with that. \r\n\r\ns -
    I can't decide if it is squooshed or not. "

  body: "@Claus Sorry about that. I will think of a new name. It seems like the good
    names are always taken. I definitely don't want to compete with Markant, as it
    looks much nicer than this font; I think it utilizes Dwiggin's Marionette theory
    very well!\r\n\r\n@Tiffany Thank you for taking the time to point out these issues.
    The diagonals in general are difficult to judge after too many attempts at minute
    adjustments, but you;re right about the y tail. I think the b & d need more as
    well. I will produce some variations for all of these suggestions and jpg them
    on this thread.\r\n\r\n-Eric MacLeod"

  body: "Here are the changes made in y,t,g,b,d, & s. I will change the name of the
    font to \"Marquardt\". That's the name of the street next to a triple-train-track
    crossing on my way to work; probably the most annoying section of my commute.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marquardt-090909_4112.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    change in the bowls/bellies and counters in d,b are slight, but I think they are
    the necessary changes. The counters in the g have been balanced a little more.
    The s has been adjusted some more...I think the spine was too fat before. I've
    included several g's here, but I have visited some of the ear variations before
    and I still feel like the ear similar to the inverted b belly-stem connection
    is the most successful. I'll have the pdf updated by tomorrow.\r\n\r\n-Eric MacLeod"

  body: "Hi Eric,\r\n\r\nThat second to last 'g' is pretty interesting. I like what's
    happening with the top bowl; have you tried giving the lower bowl a little of
    the same treatment? I wonder if, instead of the lower part of the letter being
    a single looping stroke, it instead had the \"constructed\" feeling of the top
    bowl, maybe with a teardrop-shaped counter. I have a feeling that if you get this
    letter to a place where you like it, it might inform the other letters as well
    -- and this is a good testword for working these ideas out.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nJ"

  body: "Thanks for the comment, Jonathan! Here are some totally new variations based
    on the idea of giving the lower bowl a \"constructed\" feel. I applied this g's
    [[http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Infinity/mudTyper+Weights/|Infinity-like]] upper-left
    bowl-stem connection to b & a. \r\n\r\nSeen are some other variations:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marquardt-091209_4736.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nfig.
    a. original\r\n\r\nfig. b g. with new lower bowl, a & b changed as well; angled

    g\u2013l. experimenting with giving g tail connection relief.\r\n\r\nfig. f. a

    feedback on these variations? Input from non-Type-Superheroes also welcome :)"

  body: "Hi Eric,\r\n\r\nI just couldn\u2019t resist your last \u2018Input from non-Type-Superheroes\u2019
    call. I am still smiling about it. I liked \u2018Marquardt\u2019 very much from
    the first time I saw it. It emanates a subtle elegance.\r\n\r\nStructurally speaking
    you have two options: \r\n \r\n1.\tTo design a regular typeface without unexpectedly
    innovative character shapes (like Frutiger, Scala Sans, Syntax or to put it better;
    like Futura after the Bauer craftsmen took out all the \u2018odd-looking\u2019
    like characters of Paul Renner), The Standard version for Body Text.\r\n2.\tTo
    design a typeface with 80% normal and 20% novel-looking like characters, The Alternate
    version for Display.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could make a No. 1 as a standard version
    (and even so, it would still display many very nice characteristics as it already
    does) and a No. 2 as an alternate version and see how it goes.\r\n\r\nThe last
    image with alternate versions of the word \u2018badge\u2019 that you posted concentrates
    on restructuring the overall style of \u2018Marquardt\u2019 according to the shapes
    that the letter \u2018g\u2019 might take.\r\n\r\nTrying out different \u2018g\u2019s
    is quite OK, and of those I like the ones in b, c, d and e. Altering all the other
    letters in the word \u2018badges\u2019 didn\u2019t quite work out as these letters
    in your original version are already quite nicely drawn compared to the new version.\r\n\r\nI
    am posting you some alternates for the letter \u2018g\u2019 just in case they
    might interest you.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBoris\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gs_5710.png]"
