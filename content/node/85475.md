  Text and Display]], but for some reason (a competitor is using it) I would like
  to find an alternative. I'm looking for the same fresh angular feel, and same versatility
  (lots of different weights, small caps, etc.).\r\n\r\nI'm thinking Guardian Egyptian,
  Stag Serif, etc.\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\nBy the way, it'll be used in a
  new literary magazine.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

  body: "Maybe [[http://www.motaitalic.com/fonts/vesper/weights-styles|Vesper]] from
    Motaitalic, an outstanding and recent piece of work. It is a different category,
    more a wedge serif, but the description \u201Cangular\u201D fits, plus it is not
    associated with anything when it comes to branding as far as I know, so that is
    a plus. Many weights, many characters, great use of contextual alternatives to
    improve the appearance on the page. A typeface with great potential. \r\n\r\nOther
    than that, Fontbureau has some text typefaces which are a closer match."
