    is the least unconvincing match I can find for the GODIVA, and nothing at all
    for the italic. But surely one of the professionals can do better? <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    target="_blank"> Granjon</a> or a Garamond indeed, but I  <BR>couldn&#39;t ID
    the exact version yet, Wandita. Please bear  <BR>with me. <BR> <BR>Godiva Chocolatier?
    Delicious Belgian chocolates. Mmm...

    mark? It could be pre-digital...

  body: Hmm. The logo on the <a href="http://www.godiva.com/"> Godiva web site</a>
    looks kind of like good old <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trajan/regular/testdrive.html?s=GODIVA&amp;p=48">
    Trajan</a>. It definitely doesn&#39;t jive 100% with what&#39;s here. <BR> <BR><a

    This</a> is definitely Trajan... somewhere between the Regular and Bold weights
    Adobe offers. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.shopdullestowncenter.com/photos/images/godiva.jpg">
    Here&#39;s another one</a> showing the logo in Trajan, and here it looks light
    enough to be Adobe&#39;s regular weight. <BR> <BR>As for the italic, well, I&#39;m
    still searching.
