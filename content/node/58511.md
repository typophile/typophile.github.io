  it for a documentary film project (read: no-budget) title. I'm a client, not a graphic
  designer, but I'm trying to save some money by doing this groundwork myself. Also:
  How much do these things generally cost? And is there generally a contract involved?\r\n\r\nAny
  help is greatly appreciated, including pointing me to other Web resources. BTW:
  Typophile is a great website! I'm glad I found it.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    for a non-professional face, to a few thousand for a commercial custom font. Most
    are in the $30 to $50 range per face (you usually need at least two faces)."

    you can take screen shots and paste them together in the program of your choice
