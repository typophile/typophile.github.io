  opening titles fonts\u2026 I checked Band of Brothers-post I found here, but Avenir
  or Scala Sans are not the sans serifs suggested there. And I'm not yet convinced
  that Vendetta is the serif font. I think it's the same as in Angels in America.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AinA_4780.png]\r\nIt's
  that R with that sickle-shaped leg I'm trying to figure out. I think that's Garamond
  Small Caps, but which version is beyond my reach. Poor image, sorry.\r\n\r\nAnd
  sorry again, I couldn't find a proper sample of the sans serif font in Brothers,
  but the reason I don't agree with that earlier post is that terminals of C and S
  are cut vertically like in Gill Sans, so Avenir or Scala do not apply. And it's
  not Gill Sans. Any ideas?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bandbrothersd103dk_6332.gif]\r\n"

  body: "\"ANGELS IN AMERICA\" looks like [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100020|Requiem
    ( Text )]].\r\n\r\nIt's different from the Band of Brothers titles, which I'm
    convinced are FF Scala and Vendetta. It's just that at this size and quality it's
    hard to see the details ( like the C and S, which are <em>almost</em> cut vertically
    -- and the quirkiness of Vendetta ).\r\nAlso take a look at this sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bob_6017.jpg]\r\nThe
    W is most telling that this is FF Scala Sans."
