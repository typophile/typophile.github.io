  body: 'Andy you have the same problem your classmates have. Ask your self: Why would
    anyone know this word/place is a restaurant? The name looks like it could be a
    night club, plus you gave no explaination of the type of restaurant it is. Is
    it McDonalds or Le Cirque, is it French or Asian. The logo means nothing without
    brand idenity. So make it painfully clear its about food and the kind of place
    it is.'

    passion, if everyone seems to be going in the wrong direction I suspect this instructor
    could not make a living in the real world and decided to teach instead. Unfortunate
    for his/her students, but regardless, the students can still do the quality work
    for themselves regardless of how low the standards the teacher places on passing
    or even good grades. <BR> <BR> <BR>Here is am example of some work I did a few
    years ago. that I think is nice and well though out. Exterior circular logo was
    not designed by me . My task was to improve and build upon what was existing-at
    the lowest cost possible. <BR> <BR>I would expect you can tell a lot about this
    place &#40;price point, atmosphere, services/products, etc...&#41; without any
    written explanation.  <BR> <BR>It is a hip coffeebar, they show art, they serve
    great coffee,  <BR>they offer crepes and waffles for breakfast. Neighbor hood
    is  <BR>Belltown, just north of Seattles&#39; downtown business district, urban,
    somewhat stylish clients. Simple. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35445.jpg"

  body: I&#39;ll also agree with Daniel; to me, a restaurant&#39;s identity is one
    location where the average customer should not notice flashy design or excellent
    typography. Of course the identity package you create must match the style and
    intended use of the restaurant, but &#39;overdesigning&#39; risks appearing contrived.

  body: Hi Roh. I read your critique.My reply- The Lux work is supposed to look minimalist
    &#40;or generic as you described it&#41;. Lux is located between upscale independent
    clothing stores and restaurants. It is not supposed to look expensive &#40;nor
    inexpensive&#41;. The prices are a bit higher than most cafes &#40; as well as
    quality&#41;, but it was not owners desire to specifically express the aspect.
    This is Seattle and most people do not care if it costs a bit more. People wanting
    Starbucks or Tullys can walk a block in any direction and find either &#40;again
    this is Seattle&#41;. Lux is different from both of these large Espresso mega
    chains. Lux venue is sometimes host to a variety of events from Dj music nights,
    poetry, art openings, etc. But none of these events are on regular schedules,
    nor part of Lux&#39;s core business.  <BR>The identity has served the client well
    for the last few years. Besides, it&#39;s businesscard &#40;which features logo&#41;
    was recently published in a graphic design book &#34; Best of Businesscards 6&#34;
    from Rockport Publishing, so I guess at least some industry folks find it is attractive
    and functional sincve it was picked over 1000&#39;s of other entries.  Their older
    logo is shown below. At the time this logo was used, furniture was mostly handmade
    wrought iron, and place had more of a casual &#34;artsy&#34; feeling. This was
    partially changed because people would hang out all day and buy less. New identity
    and interior changes improved sales and brought profits up to help owner sell
    business which was her desire with the changes. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35521.jpg"

    as it  is a modern lookin restarants for young... im thinking of energetic colours
    ..  as it is young ... i see u did that with ur type but would be cool to see
    it in colour... and ya... its hard to read &#34;EIGHTY NINE&#34; and looking closely
    at the &#34; eighty nine&#34; i see that &#34;HTY&#34; seems to be bigger than
    the rest of the text... is that intentional or ... ?.... anyways .... good luck..
    <BR> <BR> <BR>Hey Ole it would be nice to see you giving some positive feedback
    to Andy&#39;s work.... and give him suggestions to improve his logo.... laters!

  body: Although im only a newbie to this forum, isnt it bad form to hijack someone
    else&#39; s thread? and yet it has so far been a bit me me me with this lux business....
    <BR> <BR>Im from seatle myself -- Starbucks and Tullys arn&#39;t the only coffee
    shops in town, it  would be a mistake to compare oneself to them, much like it
    would be to compare a restaurant to mcdonalds in a design sence. <BR> <BR>In the
    industry you see a lot of varying design work and i happen to agree with what
    Roh was saying about how the lux design style is very generic and to me does not
    speak what the cafe is all about but presents a sterile view of a design style
    that is used everywhere. <BR>Does the coffee get served in a sealed plastic cup
    and rubber gloves? <BR> <BR>&#42;              &#42;                  &#42;             &#42;               &#42;
    <BR> <BR>Getting back to what we should all be here for....Andy Campbells logo...
    <BR> <BR>Very nice andy, the typography is stylish and unified, and straight away
    it says new and up beat. <BR>Perhaps a little color would pick it up a beat .
    <BR> <BR>I would say that the restaurant side of things would come out in its
    surrounding elements, and no more is needed in the primary logo to say this. <BR>It
    is nice, simple and memerable too, everything a logo should be.

  body: Hello Andy. Didn&#39;t someone do the old  <BR>number/letter thing last term,
    or maybe  <BR>one before that? Why would you write  <BR>&#39;jive89&#39; when
    the logotype spells out  <BR>more or less 318HTY9183? It looks like <BR>a hip
    accountancy firm, at this stage,  <BR>more than a restaurant. I think that it  <BR>would
    be wide to listen to all forms of  <BR>critique, even if negative. Work with <BR>the
    word jive. It has such potential. <BR>More than just flipping numbers around.

    be able to just change the name of the restaurant because it pleases you and helps
    clarify the logo design. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t know if your teacher has any stipulations  -
    you may lose marks by changing the name?

    &#34; <BR> <BR>Not to hijack the thread, but I find nothing can replace peer review.
    Even at the student level. Granted, a lot of this depends on the quality of the
    particular professor. When I was in school, I was fortunate enough to have professors
    that spent as much time teaching us the art of critique as they did teaching us
    the art of design...not to mention the art of presenting our own work. <BR> <BR>A
    lot of the restaurant logo posts in here have been &#39;this is a logo I made
    for a restaurant. What do you think?&#39; which is WAY to vague to be of any use
    to anyone giving a critique. As such, it seemes as if critiques were not being

    students...I just found it a bit odd that it was happening.'
