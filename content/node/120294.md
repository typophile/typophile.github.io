body: "If one is providing localised versions of accented characters for Polish, I'm
  wondering if it is necessary to also provide localised variants for [\xE1 \xE9 \xED
  \u0155 \xFA] to accomodate borrowings, or do Poles normally view the acute used
  in other languages as an entirely distinct accent from the kreseczka which therefore
  need not harmonize with Polish diacritics?\r\n\r\nAlso, would it normally be viewed
  as acceptable to use the same accent form for both kreseczka and greek tonos or
  are there aesthetic differences between the two?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Hi Andr\xE9\r\nIn old metal times acute was (not always) a bit steeper than
    grave, in all accented letters. And it's fine for me:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AntPolt_5967.jpg]\r\nSo
    you can make acutes and graves the same (mirror image) (as authors of revival
    [[http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/poltawski/download/index_html|Antykwa
    P\xF3\u0142tawskiego]]) or steeper acute, as in example above and in original
    [[http://archiwum.allegro.pl/oferta/wzornik-czcionek-asp-czcionka-typografia-pismo-i4345826316.html|P\xF3\u0142tawski]]\r\nBTW,
    the problem with locl feature is it is triggered when given language is chosen
    - so what when the text is English or None?\r\n\r\n\"do Poles normally view the
    acute....\" Most probably I don't care.\r\n[last but not least: I hate those flat
    accents, especially popular in UC]"

    you're hyphenating your text incorrectly anyway. A decent typographer should set
    the language accordingly. I don't see this is a problem."
