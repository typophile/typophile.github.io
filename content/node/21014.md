body: "I'm revamping/recharging my portfolio website with a new design and a lot of
  new work/scrapping old work. The question now comes to mind, how do I showcase a
  38 page (20 spreads) design? Do I just show key pages from within the book? Should
  I provide a low res PDF of the entire book on my site or just leave that till actual
  portfolio reviews? (in person that is)\r\n\r\nThanks."

    or three spreads. Also, show variety in the spreads you choose. \r\n\r\nIf you
    show too much people will get bored and move on.\r\n\r\nLuke."

  body: "Agreed. I personally dont like to show anything digital if it isnt a digital
    work. Take pictures of the book from interesting angles which shows another layer
    of composition. The portfolio is just a preview (think movie trailer) that grabs
    attention. If they wanna see the actual book, they'll have to interview you.\r\n\r\nDon't
    know if you are working on a personal identity but that will make you stand out
    and shows you know how to market yourself."

  body: "Pretty much just looking for a place to send people when they ask if I have
    a website. I know face-to-face interviews is where I'll get a job, but a website
    doesn't hurt as a preview. I don't have access to the book as it's being photographed
    entered into a competition. I'll just go for the spreads idea.\r\n\r\nThis is
    what the page layouts will look like: http://users.adelphia.net/~dabailey/portfolio.identity.thumbs.png\r\n\r\nand
    then I'm using <a href=\"http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/>Lightbox
    JS</a> to show my work like this: http://users.adelphia.net/~dabailey/portfolio.lightbox.mockup.png"

  body: "I disagree with Prakash in that it tends to annoy me when a book is shown
    from a funky angle. I just want to see the design. I think show the best spreads
    (2-5) on the site.\r\n\r\nThe worst offender was AIGA - one year for their 50
    books/50 covers catalogue all the books were shot way close up from absurd oblique
    angles so you couldn't see the design at all. Then to add insult to injury they
    included THEIR OWN BOOK in their annual the next year."

    navigation between projects - how will that be done? Also a big fan of lightbox
    which I use on my site, as it is so easy to implement and never failed to impress
    potential clients.\r\n\r\nAbout presenting books, i personally don't mind a 'funky'
    cover shot as long as it only serves as an opener and is supported by detailed
    previews. (2-3 spreads)\r\n\r\nGood luck with your site,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n"

  body: "Well you could go with a nice Flash Based Book so they can see through the
    whole thing. Or you can just show snipets of each page and some doodles/ sketches/
    explinations/ etc. for each page but that is a lot of work altogethar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo
    be honest the site is a bit plain. Not that its necessarily a bad thing, I love
    plain portfolio sites, but this one seems a bit too generic. The textured background
    seems like a default idea, why not make a custom background out of type or logos
    that you've done all one colour fading out instead of some walllpaper? The logo
    looks cool but I think it would look good by itself with the X and without Graphic
    Artist and the underline. The Nav is a bit boring, the blank space doesn't look
    like it has a purpose, and how will it look with say 20 items for each section?\r\n\r\nDo
    you design/ impliment websites along with your other talents as a designer?\r\n"

    I sit down with my friend who's a web developer and start actually creating the
    website.\r\n\r\nJesse: I know it's plain, I'm really just giving my work a chance
    to be shown on the web. My work is primarily print design with a little identity
    and typographic work now and then. If it's absolutey necessary, I can do a little
    hand coding in HTML but that's about it, my focus is not to impress them with
    my website design, but rather the work included."

  body: "I like the plainess but I have a gripe about slightly obscure big zoom icons,
    they seem to everywhere and rarely add to the view experience, I understand the
    reasoning for them but I wonder if you would not be better off showing the front
    cover (or whole image) that one can click on and get a larger view, preferably
    with an even larger view option so the details can be inspected. Bit of a rant
    sorry.\r\n\r\nThe pdfs are are good idea (avoids the requirement for the largest
    zooms) would there not be a copyright issue if you put the whole book up on your
    site? Two or three spreads should be sufficient for a portfolio though.\r\n\r\nTim"

    do you think about the thumbnails? zoomed in? or fit as much in the thumbnail
    size as possible? Mostly just placeholders in there now but the first three thumbs
    in 'PRINT' are fitting as much in as possible (almost a full spread)."
