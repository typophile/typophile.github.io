  body: ' what i meant by the &#34;RS &amp; SR&#34; was that they could be the start
    of the font names &#40;ie: RS Van Extended &amp;  SR Van Extended&#41; within
    the family. <BR>i really like the symbols. i wasn&#39;t refering to them. i was
    talking about how you plain fonts and italic fonts look different. if you have
    a plain version of your italic fonts and vise versa, you could have to different
    fonts in the same family. <BR>i like both of them &#40;plain and italic&#41; but
    think they should have different type style for more versitality. again only my
    2&cent;. keep it up,  its a great face. '

  body: ' First of all thank&#39;s to both to made the critics and the appreciation.
    The Oblique versions I made a skew &#40; -12&ordm;&#41; and I tryed to give the
    better apperence of the Italic fellings on this oblique version. Like for the
    exemple the oblique l/c &#40;a&#41;, don&#39;t have the typical apperence of the
    oblique normaly used but I desided to use something more expressive to give a
    new felling for the family and for the visual combination. Thank&#39;s for the
    comments to l/c &#40;g&#41; in real fact the letter must be thinking again. <BR>Steve
    if you don&#39;t mind I would like understand better the points that you refered
    on last message about the plain version that you sayed that are very different
    of the oblique set. One more time thank&#39;s Steve and Stephen. <BR>regads for
    all / Ricardo '

    different than you italic &#34;a&#34; &amp; &#34;e&#34;. if you <BR>gave the italic
    version an plain set and vise versa, you could have two sets of fonts within the
    <BR>&#34;Van&#34; family. other than that, it think it&#39;s a great face. keep
    it up.

  body: ' Now I understand!! and thank&#39;s for the aswer Steve. In fact personaly
    I didn&#39;t wanted to designed the letters with the apperence of the normaly
    oblique l/c letter &#40;a&#41;=&#40; Plain with skew inclination to simulate italic&#41;
    fell&#39;s me a rigid visual felling. I think that this set is oblique because
    are not a typical italic &#40;more scrip&#41;. I tryed to change the apperence
    with the other alternative l/c &#40;a&#41; which is more similiar of the italic,
    like the other letter l/c &#40;e&#41; that I try ed to incorporated a &#40;scrip&#41;
    apperence in that caracther and the others of course.  <BR> <BR>But I would like
    to have more feedbacks about this question to have a clear ideia of the frontier
    that I&#39;m trying to tread.  <BR> <BR>PS: Thanks David for your critics-&#40;
