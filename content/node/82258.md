    as did ATypI in San Francisco. \r\n\r\nBoston, not so much, Tufte's keynote speech
    was too pompous for me, and the hotel bar closed too early. TypeCon in Toronto,
    Minneapolis, and New York were good. TypeCon Boston was OK except for the 10,000
    hours devoted to Dwiggens. TypeCon San Francisco couldn't compete with the city
    so I have no opinion other than it was nice to see so much of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nI
    stayed in a great hotel in Dublin, but I just can shake the memory of a presenter
    sitting down behind laptop head literally in hand apologizing for not being able
    to find his notes while he mumbled on. I remember there being a lot of that. But
    hey, I got to drink where Bono hangs out."
