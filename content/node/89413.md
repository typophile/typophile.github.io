  body: "Hmm. Verdana is one of the typefaces that comes with Windows. It is an odd
    choice for the subtitles in Mission Impossible 4, but to compare to Avatar - which
    used Papyrus - they would have to have used something truly bizarre. Like Hobo
    (a good typeface when used as intended) or Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nBut that's an exaggeration.
    Intentionally using a \"bad typeface\" for subtitles is unlikely.\r\n\r\nI'd suspect
    that using even a good typeface like Bodoni or Caslon or Times Roman is inadvisable
    for subtitles. A sans-serif typeface with a uniform stroke width seems to make
    very good sense as the thing to use against a variable background.\r\n\r\nHelvetica,
    Univers... or Bell Gothic? What about Futura?\r\n\r\nOr Kabel?\r\n\r\nIf it's
    the uniform stroke width, and not the lack of serifs, that's important, what about
    Stymie or Memphis?\r\n\r\nPerhaps News Gothic is closer to what might be the most
    tasteful...\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nWriting this post led me to realize that I did not
    know a good subtitle typeface offhand. Franklin Gothic is too heavy, and News
    Gothic too light. So I did a web search, and found this:\r\n\r\n[[http://screenfont.ca/fonts/today/webfonts-screenfonts/]]\r\n\r\nan
    illustration of another movie using Verdana for subtitles and why that did not
    work. (Although imperfect, though, it seems better than some of my examples. The
    spacing of the letters is wrong, but at least the face has the right weight.)\r\n\r\n[[http://screenfont.ca/fonts/today/interim/|This
    page]] notes good examples, like Officina.\r\n\r\nHere's the page I started from:\r\n\r\n[[http://screenfont.ca/fonts/today/]]"

    Gothic worked well in the Star Wars movies, and you could argue that the thought
    process behind Avatar's use of Papyrus at least had logic on its side.\r\n\r\nVerdana
    in MI4 seems to have been random, as the director's tweet seems to suggest. \r\n\r\nSi "
