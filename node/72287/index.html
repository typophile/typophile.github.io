  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I'm currently redesigning a magazine for a client who has a very low budget (almost non-existent). I'm at the stage of deciding which fonts to use for body copy. I don't think I'll get anywhere with free fonts, hence I chose Museo Sans for display and captioning. I'd like to look into alternatives for similar prices as the Exljbris 'free' fonts ($15-30 per weight).

I like Calluna, but I'd prefer it if the magazine didn't end up looking like an Exljbris specimen.

Has anyone ever worked with a good, usable, cheap serif font for body copy use in a long document like a magazine or book?

Thanks

Jono</div>

Other free font families:

thanks for your suggestions, but I'm not looking for a free font. For precisely the reasons Jan mentioned. I expect italics and other weights as it's for setting an entire magazine with, so I fully expect to pay. The budget is limited tho, so something under $30 a weight would be good.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Khaled,

There's a difference between quality and suitable. I looked at the fonts and didn't think any of them were suitable for the look of the magazine I'm working on. Gentium comes closest, and is a good font, just not quite what I feel would suit my content. Lido on the other hand looks much better, and is only $19/weight. 

So when you say the open source fonts are 'much much better than any commercial font you can get for 33$' you're wrong. It's all about context, which you and your angry tone seemed to be forgetting. 

Do us all a favour and keep your anger to yourself. It's incredibly rude to say to someone 'you didn't even bother googling them to check yourself' when you have no idea about what I did or didn't do. Arrogance and anger will get you and your fonts nowhere.</div>

Be that as it may, your statements struck me as much angrier and more terse than Khaled's. He just made an assumption, and his following remark wasn't even pointed at you specifically. I didn't find his comment condescending or arrogant in the least.

On the other hand, remarks like:

-<em>I'm not sure I can be bothered with your tone and your weird rhetorical questions.</em>
-<em>Do us all a favour and keep your anger to yourself. </em>
-<em> I think it's time you relaxed,</em>

...strike me as very pointedly condescending. As if you're so much better because you know how to "keep your cool" online. Add to that the sarcasm:

-<em>Deep breaths, calm thoughts, my fonts are good, my fonts are good, my fonts are good...</em>

...honestly, I think Khaled is being much more cordial than you.

Just my two cents. Good luck with your magazine.</div>

But if you decide for a DSType font, I would ask here about the quality of the kerning. The quality of the kerning varies from font to font. In case of Capsa (which I like very much) it is good in my opinion, but Capsa is not a magazine font.

I am amateur, but as far as I know, you are not allowed to transfer the fonts to the client. You can transfer the license (at least in Germany), after you have finished the work, but then you are not allowed to use the fonts anymore. As far as I know, it is common practice, that you include the costs or parts of the costs of your license into the bill. But then I would think about investing more money in a font, that you can use later in another project. And in this case I would not let the client pay the complete costs of your license, but maybe the half only. What I want to say is, that you are not allowed to work with fonts of the client. So it is primary you, who decides, if he is willing to invest in your license.</div>

   Khaled is the one who said he was angry, before I referred to his anger. Forums really aren't the place to start with anger.

  I think it is time he relaxed, it's just a forum post. My sarcasm was a means to cut the atmosphere in here. It's not a question of keeping it cool, it's about asking questions and not projecting assumptions on people. 

Let's stop all the fuss, I've got some good options to progress with now.
