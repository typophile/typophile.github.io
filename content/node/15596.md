body: "Funky lo-rez image attached. It looks a little \"smooshed\" down, but the \"e\"
  looks dinstinctive. On MyFonts, I found this one:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/uncial-romana-nd/\r\n\r\nwith
  the extended bar on the \"e\" but it's obviously not a match. \r\n\r\nAny other
  ideas?"

  body: Seems quite possible that it's not a font. It may have been done by a calligrapher.
    What and when is it from?

  body: 'It was supplied by a customer that wants this inlaid in a guitar. What he
    told us was, "any calligrapher will know this font," so I was a little leary that
    it might not be a font at all. Hopefully I''ll hear back from him with more details
    about the source. '

  body: "Indeed it does, with a slightly squished height. Thanks! I downloaded this
    font, and I noticed that even my low resolution source seems smoother. After converting
    to outlines, it seems there are way too many control points adding minute dimples
    and ripples to the bowls. \r\n\r\nI won't need it for my purposes, since I have
    to modify this for cutting mother of pearl, but I bet there is a higher quality
    font out there."

    target=\"_blank\">Ondine</a> as an alternative to Carolingia, but it doesn't have
    the same G or E as in your sample.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Your sample seems like it may well be good enough to vector trace, Or have
    someone do it far a small fee. Mmmm. Like me.
