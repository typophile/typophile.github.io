  font?\r\n\r\nIt has been used by Blizzard Entertainment for their video games Diablo
  II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction and apparently Diablo III (picture is from that
  game's website). It is not the Exocet/Dogma/AvQuest font (googling \"Diablo fonts\"
  only led to this typeface). I am also pretty sure it is not a custom font that is
  only available to them as Blizzard tend towards using free fonts for their interface
  designs.\r\n\r\nAny clues? Your help is very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nEloa"

    able to find it by this name.\r\n\r\nMike F. is pretty good at knowing digital
    equivalents for revived typefaces. Mike are you out there?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    name). Good work Steve.  Codex, however, is not the same, as you recognized, though
    similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
