  interested to showcase their fonts with alteration to the k / K letter shape to
  \u0915 / \u0915 (lower and upper case) shape.  This is per http://Kalphabet.googlepages.com.
  \ These could be hosted at TSNK (Thou Shall Not Kill) -> TSN\u0915: Thou Shall Not
  \u0915ill website - www.TSNK.org.\r\n\r\nThe result would be a boost for the font
  community showing fonts development and a pro bono cause.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here I thought this thread was about font escrow, and I would have made some
    comments about how typographers have a right not to compete with themselves.\r\n\r\nSince
    the English alphabet isn't written from a vertical bar at the top, I would have
    recommended that if one must suggest an alternate K taken from an Indian script,
    one ought to use Gujarati rather than Sanskrit as the source. But the idea that
    the shape of this letter brings about bad vibrations, as it were, because of an
    ancient story about a suicide taking place where three rivers met... is clearly
    unpersuasive to most people, who see no reason to think that religious traditions
    to which they do not subscribe have that kind of significance."

  body: "@John Savard:\r\n\r\nI always find that the Gujarati ka immediately reminds
    me of a prostate figure with an oversized thumbtack rammed through its back (presumably
    placed there by Vlad the Impaler whose travels through the Gujaraat are well known),
    so I definitely would not advocate using Gujarati as a source for our new letter
    K. In fact, I would advocate starting a campaign to eliminate the letter ka from
    Gujarati altogether.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: I went back to the site and checked. Apparently the photos, which make the
    intersecting rivers look like a Y, only show the real physical rivers - but at
    that site, there is also "the Saraswati, which is an invisible river that flows
    from Heaven and comes up from underground", so if you add the extra river, that
    is how the Y changes to a K.

  body: "Doesn't the letter \"Y\" have three strokes of physical ink and one of invisible
    ink from Heaven? That's how I always write it. In \"K\", <em>all</em> the strokes
    are physical (unless you count the ley line that sticks perpendicularly up out
    of the page at you from the conjunction of the ink strokes, but that's <em>good</em>
    energy, so should cancel out any negative vibes anyway).\r\n\r\nHey, did somebody
