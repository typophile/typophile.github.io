  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I volunteer for a small organisation which publishes a magazine giving a socio-political analysis of current events.  The magazine is aimed at the general public, but many of our long-term subscribers are becoming older and visually impaired, and are complaining that the text is hard to read.  We don&rsquo;t want to increase the font size to the point where our typography stands out like a sore thumb as that will turn off new and casual readers, so perhaps we could change the typeface to something more legible?  The body text currently looks to be 9.5 pt Times New Roman (clichéd, I know).  I hear that studies have shown that Century Schoolbook is more legible to young readers; would it also be more legible to older or visually impaired ones?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would suggest Utopia that matches well the magazine subject and also has larger x-height. However, I did not test it in reality for legibility issues compared to Times.</p>
<p>You could also try Times Seven

that is more robust for small sizes, so you would not actually change the typeface that much while improving legibility.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>there&rsquo;s an interesting quote (although I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t know who from) that the best way to create legibility would be for everyone to use the same fonts for everything. My cynical side says this is why the Royal National Institute for the Blind suggest Arial as their font of choice for visually impaired people.</p>
<p>Not sure if this suggestion is viable for your readership,  but you could consider presenting a summary of the article in large print at the beginning, offering readers the chance to decide if the article is of interest, and worth straining their eyes for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I just finished some large-print business cards which were tested by a focus group of adults with low vision, probably even lower than your average senior magazine reader, and am currently working on a large-print brochure for a museum. Most of my subjects preferred a sans serif face (the serif face looked &ldquo;busy&rdquo;), but the biggest issue was the boldness of the type. That may be why Arial was recommended and why Century SB is preferred by your readers. Both types are darker on the page than comparable typefaces in the same weight. My theory is that when you take a regular weight face and enlarge it beyond normal text sizes you are changing the overall color of the text on the page so there is a higher proportion of white space. That makes it harder to distinguish figure from ground. I came to this theory after reading two large-print novels myself. (Also, large-print is defined as above 14 point.) Now that I am approaching the age when my eyesight will be compromised more and more by normal aging, along with millions of baby-boomers, I am very interested in how to make it look good.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Anyone can get reading glasses as they age, but people don&rsquo;t bother.
So they hold the page further away, or slide their glasses down their nose.
In both cases, the type gets smaller, because it&rsquo;s further away.
Fine details vanish, and clunkers like Century Schoolbook start to look good.
That&rsquo;s somewhat patronizing to your readership, treating the poor old folks like children.</p>
<p>As a typographer, you can simulate the state of affairs.
Read your page from a distance beyond your normal comfort zone, and for good measure in slightly dim lighting (the cornea gains opacity with age).
Experiment with type styles and setting parameters, and you will find many ways to improve legibility, other than going with generic &ldquo;research has found&rdquo; solutions.
And they will be solutions that are relevant to your page layout and publication.
Typography and graphic design are practical disciplines, not theoretical.</p>
