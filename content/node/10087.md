    target="_blank">Futura bold condensed</a> seems very close, even though this was
    probably custom lettering. A little flattening would make it closer.

  body: That is because this lettering was probably drawn by hand. This is why no
    font is likely to be 100%. Sometimes you can only get close.  <BR> <BR>You must
    also realize that without being able to compare side-by-side, most people cannot
    see a difference.
