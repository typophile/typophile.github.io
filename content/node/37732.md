  are a growing number of you)...\r\n\r\nSimply create a bookmark on your iPhone of
  the Typophile <em>Tracker</em>, http://www.typophile.com/tracker\r\n\r\nThis gives
  you a view of all the current and recent posts (wiki, forums, blogs) listed chronologically.
  No this isn't new, but it should be useful until Apple supports the Flash player
  in Safari Mobile.\r\n\r\nPosted from my phone... Cheers."

    our 10.5 installs to 10.4?
