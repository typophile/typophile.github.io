  body: The problem is, even an apparently perfectly geometrical typeface  <BR>like
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;searchby=manufacturer&amp;displayfontid=LH.108008.0.3"
    target="_blank"> ITC Avant Garde Gothic</a> will have subtle optical adjustments,  <BR>as
    without them the characters would just look plain wrong. A circle  <BR>looks like
    an ellipse when it&#39;s a perfect circle, a join will fill up  <BR>optically
    if there are no subtle ink traps and so on... <BR> <BR>Can there be <i>no optical
    corrections at all,</i> or is it OK if they&#39;re  <BR>almost unnoticable?

  body: Many geometric typefaces that use round, not oblong, or oval, counters can
    be found in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html" target="_blank">Part
    1 of the Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide</a>. Since those are sometimes scans from
    older books, not all of them are in digital form, but many of them are.
