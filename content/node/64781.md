body: "I decided to join these forums after coming across them repeatedly in my search
  for information on the TTS unit system. (One web site claims to provide it, but
  the character set doesn't match what is offered on normal calculating keyboards.
  I remember long ago seeing it once in a book in a library, but I could no longer
  find it when I looked for it.)\r\n\r\nHearing about ATF Self-Spacing Type, I decided
  to look up the information, and eventually I also found information about other
  similar later products from ATF: their Typotabular Gothic and their Quick-Set Roman/Bold/Italic.\r\n\r\nI
  have compiled some of the information I ran across on this page on my web site:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm\r\n\r\n-
  it should be noted the site is concerned with mathematics and computers and things
  like that in general, not typography or artistic subjects."
