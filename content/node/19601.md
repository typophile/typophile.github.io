    had the same ID posted twice in a row before? \r\n\r\nAnd, splitting hairs here,
    I think it's the Linotype version of Fling which has alternates and swashes (look
    at the second sample)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fling/"

  body: "Patty, I think the Alts are embedded in the character set of the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/fling/fling/charmap.html\">Letraset
    version</a>. Linotype just split them out, because I think a lot of people don't
    know those Letraset fonts have alternate characters hidden in the font (see Papyrus
    and Fine Hand, to mention two that have more to them than most people realize.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "<em>\"Is it the new Eclat?\"</em>\r\n\r\nGod, I hope not. Just because Martha
    uses it on her magazine doesn't mean it's wonderful. It has it's place, and one
    word on a cover is fine, I'd say. Martha could do for fonts what Oprah did for
    books, if she starts making that part of her 'style realms', and I don't really
    think it would be 'a good thing' for design.\r\n\r\nWhy are people afraid to trust
    their own taste in type (or judgement in books, for that matter)?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: They pair it very successfully with Filosofia. It also appears they are using
    Martha's version of News Gothic (but I could be wrong) which I believe was done
    at Hoefler & Frere-Jones.
