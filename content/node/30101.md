    tester/preview is also v. important. I'm less interested in pdf specimens, top
    sellers, new releases, newsletters, etc.\r\n\r\nFree font giveaways/promos are
    nice too."

    basis is not only unimportant to me but not the least bit helpful.  I poke around
    in the \"sitemap\" page hoping to find something more friendly. Eventually, I
    find a page which has a listing of catagories such as style, art period, and year
    of design. This helps better than the collection thing so I think it should be
    on the homepage and part of the top nav throughout.\r\nKeyword search is good
    too. I personally don't care much about top sellers. that does not help me find
    anything I want. New Releases is good though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    is a must. And the WTF-engine is awesome. Thats one of the reasons many people
    go there ...\r\n\r\nAlso it would be nice to have a specialized system of categorizing
    if you are a logged-in-user. What does that mean? As a logged-in-member I would
    like to give the typefaces I am seeing special keywords. Just for me. For example,
    the ones I choose looking like Bauhaus-examples, I want to categorize like that.
    Just for me. Or if a see a typeface which looks like the one from the local bakerys,
    Iwant to categorize it like that: Let's say: \"Mayers B\xE4ckerei Script\". MyFonts
    is having something like that, but it is pretty complicated. Dafont has it, too,
    but I would prefer Pulldown-menus instead of those \"go-to-the-next-site-and-choose-what-you-like-sites\".
    Speed is important. \r\n\r\nBTW: Fast-loading is a must. And re-direct is an absolute
    no-no! If you have to, redirect at the secure-paysites, but not at the fontchoosing
    ones. Good luck. "

    been watching the \"black market\" -- kids out there love to get PDF files so
    they can extract the font. They don't care about kerning. They don't care about
    stealing. They just don't care.\r\n\r\nI belong to several different type boards
    - and some are definitely easier than others. Some you learn their personality
    - and it works. One feature that makes a type board easiest - is a strong SEARCH
    feature. Also, I like see the Upper & lower cases - not a sentence... and I appreciate
    the ability to see the word in each of the typefaces I am browsing.\r\n\r\nBiddy

    - I have found Veer.com's character sets flawless, especially when it comes to
    the OT fonts with their tons of characters...\r\n\r\nP.S. I just looked in on
    a site - and sure enough there was a new listing - and I'd like to share it with

    \r\nYes, I know that with the Mac is not possible extract characters from a pdf

  body: I respectfully disagree with your PDF policy, Jackie. Hackers/collectors/pirates
    will always find ways to acquire fonts. The vast majority of these folks do not
    buy. Very few sales are lost on them. If a foundry limits the way paying customers
    can view their fonts (a printable PDF is vital) they are only shooting themselves
    in the foot.

  body: "Stephen -\r\n\r\nWhy make it so easy for people to get the fonts. You can
    have your pdfs - I only suggest at this point to \"flatten\" the file -- so that
    the font will not be embedded. When done properly, you will still see the crispness
    of each character.\r\n\r\nYou wrote that very few sales are lost to them. I am
    starting to disagree. It isn't one person going about their business... there
    seems to be a whole underground - whether its through a torrent or a rapid access
    type site -- the foundries are losing a fortune. Part of me wants to say I don't
    care -- I paid out plenty in the late 1980s and 1990s -- being a typographer in
    NY -- and the second one in the city to use Macs for \"real\" typesetting. But
    then it drives me crazy - I paid... and now someone can pluck a whole foundry's
    collection for their own use - and for free.\r\n\r\nIt also amazes me that the
    person at home, with a computer - can own more typefaces today -- than Photolettering
    owned in the 1990s -- and it doesn't have to cost them a cent.\r\n\r\nI'm rambling
    on here - but, I just wanted to add one thing about paying - I have a neighbor
    new to computers. She bought a Dell. She was amazed at my type library, and the
    price it cost me. Her attitude - \"I didn't know you had to pay for fonts.\" Unfortunately,
    that is the mentality of so many novices out there..."

    <em>exactly</em> what they need. (Does that make any sense?)\r\n\r\nSometimes
    I've been digging only to find that there is no package for a family and I have
    to add each weight or style in order to build my own package. To me, <a href=http://www.stormtype.com>StormType's</a

    quadratic curves, noticeably altering the letterforms, especially at small to

    the best method for previewing a face in its true form.
