  font identify tools, and I've got pretty similar fonts, but not the exact match.\r\n\r\nI
  need the exact names because it's the fonts of a series of brands and I'm not allowed
  to change them, the owner doesn't know the name of the fonts, and he doesn't have
  any means to contact the original designer.\r\n\r\nHope you can help me.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!"

    Bold]] but was customized so the points on the M were flattened.

    body: "Thank you so much John! You just saved my life. Those are exactly the fonts
      I was looking for. And you're right, maybe the M from the Mashine Bold was modify,
      since the X look exactly like the one in the image.\r\n\r\nNow I can move on
      with my work.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you very much!"
