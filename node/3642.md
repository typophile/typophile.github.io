body: This is my first post, and first typeface.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still mid-process,
  but see the design fracturing into a few different directions and was hoping I could
  get some feedback about which characters are the most successful at this point,
  so I can use those as models to finish out the face. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance
  for your advice. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.iixii.net/type/">Sample here</a>

  body: I think that some of the ligatures you are creating are interesting. I like
    the &#34;AN&#34; at the top.  The second &#34;N&#34; is my favorite.  This looks
    like it would be used to reference art deco.  <BR> <BR>Generally I prefer the
    versions with a wider character width. In specific the 2nd &#34;N&#34; and &#34;R&#34;,
    the first &#34;K&#34; and &#34;J&#34;.  Within it as a whole I think you need
    to decide on a set of characters that all go together&#40;26 letters, etc.&#41;
    and post that so we can all see if they are all working together. It is harder
    to tell when you have a few variations of each. <BR> <BR>Im undecided about the
    outline around each. What are your influences for this typeface? <BR> <BR>jp

  body: Thank you for your thoughts.  <BR> <BR>I guess I was leaning in the opposite
    direction that you are suggesting, I&#39;ve personally been leaning towards the
    narrow width forms &#40;first &#34;R&#34; second &#34;V&#34; 5th &#34;2&#34;&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t hammered out a concrete list of influences, but there seems
    to be this art deco influence, a cheesy romance or whodunnit novel influence,
    with a dash of disco, and a dash of football jersey. All of these are kind of
    imagined though, I have not done any formal research.  <BR> <BR>Of course I want
    this thing to be well crafted, but I&#39;m not looking to build a &#34;workhorse&#34;.
    I would rather err on the side of quirky and lowbrow. <BR> <BR>Also, I realize
    that at this point I&#39;m giving you too many options, but in the end I was expecting
    to offer the typeface with many alternates, so that users have a lot of flexibility
    in creating unique word shapes. <BR> <BR>Below I&#39;ve greyed out letters that
    are either unresolved, or which I can&#39;t choose which one I like. The dark
    black ones, are more or less the foundations of the face. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28873.gif"

  body: I was going to say it has vague resemblances to City, in relation to your
    football comment. Whichever way you choose the letterform are all crafted fairly
    well.  I guess I would just throw a dart&#40;while peeking through&#41;and use
    the results to map out the rest. <BR> <BR>As a pixel font, I think it is fairy
    strong. Unique and just another face created in light of our growing reliance
    on the web. <BR> <BR>jp

  body: 'Thanks for the praise, after a week away from it I&#39;m starting to see
    a clearer conclusion to this one. <BR> <BR>Anyway, assuming that I am able to
    successfully finish it as a PSD, do you know of any foundries that work with pixel
    fonts that are semi-anti-aliased such as this one? '
