  was wondering what some people thought were some of the better school&#39;s typographically.  There&#39;s
  obvious ones like CalArts, Cranbrook and Yale, but I was wondering if anyone had
  other schools in mind. I won&#39;t mention the school I attend, just so it doesn&#39;t
  seem bias in some way. I&#39;m planning on going to grad school in a few years and
  I really want a school with a strong typography program. I&#39;m really interested
  to see what people think of the educators out there. '

    love to see some.. <BR>I mean if youre &#34;planning&#34; to go to grad school
    in a FEW years time...then you will have lots of time to sort out what kinda knowledge
    youre seeking. A school that springs to mind is a french one that I can&#39;t
    remember the name of...So unless youre an american that wanna stay in america
    i would look towards Europe. I belive Royal College of Art &#40;London&#41; has
    a good typography-course. Anyway, good luck with your quest...and I admire your
    dedication to typography as it seems from your plans. <BR> <BR>Sbo '
