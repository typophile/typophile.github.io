		<div class="commentbody">I don't agree that a serif font would be necessarily good for large amounts of text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It may be controvertial to say this but the idea that a serif font is more readable is very much old-school thinking. Modern research, apparently, suggests that there's no significant difference in legibility between serif and sans today. Remember, &quot;People read best what they read most&quot;, and there's such an abundance of both serif and sans serif fonts out there in use everyday. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I subscribe to the principle of identity between content and expression, so the font you choose should reflect the kind of work you do. If it's technology or design orientate, then a Sans Serif is often more appropriate. Unless your design is distinctly retro of course.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To me the aggregate of data, experience and intuition tells me that serifs help reading. There are bits of empirical research (not much, unfortunately) that makes sense in the context of what most typographers believe about reading and many people believe about human nature. The tons of empirical research that point away from the bouma (letter-cluster-shape) model of reading are simply flawed when you analyze the details; but they shouldn't be ignored outright (even though that's what most empiricists do with anecdotal experience, sadly), they should be assimilated. Every bit has to make sense. And in the bouma model it does. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There's no Proof of this (yet). But I for one think that proof is for lab rats. On the other hand, saying &quot;it justs makes sense&quot; is indeed unfair - it's just difficult to elaborate all the time, especially since this is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> actually a simple topic - not at all. It's like E B Huey said almost a hundred years ago, but sadly academic hubris tends to impede self-doubt, tends to put aside the very real paradox that numbers don't lie simply because numbers don't say anything - we just hear them say things, and sometimes we hear what we expect. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess a good way to arrive at usable (if tentative) practical conclusions is to strike a balance between personal research and trusting others who have done more research. The former helps gauge the reliability of the latter, and so does putting the latter in context. In my view cognitive scientists can be trusted to generate reliable <!-- raw HTML omitted -->data<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but are not in a position to interpret the data properly, simply because they (generally) lack any anecdotal experience to guide them. They work with assumptions (something inescapable) that originate in a vaccum, or from their own personaly (non-typographic) experience. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whatever you do though, please don't be afraid to leave the house because you have no proof that a car won't hit you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Glad I asked. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't you think though, that in marketing communications at least, absolute legibility is, more often than not, not an absolute, 100% priority? Not least because the drop in readability between a conventional serif and sans serif font, if either measured mathematically or judge intuitively, must surely be minimal.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The appropriate level of readability is also just one part of the puzzle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The influence a well chosen font has on an identity or brand is significant and isn't that the context of Henrik's original question, which I don't think we've answered (quite possibly my fault).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Henrik, if you're still there, I'd suggest Frutiger, Bliss or perhaps even Berthold's Imago. None of them are particularly &quot;new&quot; but are clean, legible, look contemporary and are well designed.
