  has got a good amount of glyphs, around 700. I like it because of its\r\nroughness,
  but I\u2019m not completely sure.\r\n\r\nCould you guys express your opinion about
  it?\r\nHave you any alternative for it?\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nAny doubts or strong
  opinion about it, will be well-accepted. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C_ITAO-10005000_3736.GIF]"
